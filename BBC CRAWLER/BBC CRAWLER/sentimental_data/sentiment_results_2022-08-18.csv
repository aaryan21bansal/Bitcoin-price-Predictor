"Rishi Sunak has insisted he still has a ""shot"" at Downing Street despite polls suggesting Liz Truss has a strong lead in the Conservative leadership contest. He told ITV's This Morning he ""definitely"" had a chance of victory, while warning his rival's tax-cutting plans risked fuelling inflation. The former chancellor said his economic approach was ""honest"" and deliverable. The latest poll of Tory members pointed to 66% backing Ms Truss and 34% supporting Mr Sunak. The YouGov survey of 1,089 people for Sky News was conducted from 12-17 August. The percentages were calculated by excluding undecided members and non-voters. The next UK prime minister will be announced on 5 September. The postal ballot closes on 2 September, but thousands of party members are thought to have already voted. But Mr Sunak said: ""I'm really excited to keep going, I think my ideas are the right ones."" Warning Tory leadership tax cut pledges unrealistic Tory leadership candidates battle for votes in NI How accurate are Tory leadership polls? Asked aboutLabour's proposal to freeze energy bills, partly by backdating the windfall tax on oil and gas companies' profits, he argued this would be a ""very blunt instrument"", providing ""a lot of support for people who don't need it"". In an apparent attack on Ms Truss's campaign pledges, he warned that increasing borrowing during a time of high inflation would be ""really risky"". ""It's like putting fuel on the fire and that's the mistake we made in the 70s, I don't want to repeat that mistake,"" he said. On Wednesday, it emerged the inflation rate in July had soared to 10.1%, a 40-year high. Ms Truss has argued that taxes are too high and risk ""choking off growth"". She says businesses are less likely to invest, and people are less likely to set up businesses or get jobs. Reducing taxation, the foreign secretary has said, is the best way of staving off a recession. Mr Sunak said restoring trust in government and politics was about ""under-promising and over-delivering"". ""That's why in this leadership race I've not been making lots of easy promises that I think are false, I'd rather lose than say things I don't think can be delivered, I'd rather be honest with people."" Elsewhere in his ITV interview, Mr Sunak described Boris Johnson's battle to cling to power in July as ""a bit odd"". His own resignation as chancellor helped toprompt more than 50 other members of the government to follow suit. Asked if the prime minister still talks to him, Mr Sunak said: ""No, no. I've reached out to him but understandably he's not replied. ""That's fair but it wasn't just me, at the end of the day, 60 other members of the government all resigned as well."" Ms Truss has continued to praise Mr Johnson's record as prime minister. She has now agreed to be interviewed by the BBC's Nick Robinson. The interview will be broadcast live on BBC1 on 30 August. Mr Robinsonquestioned her rivalearlier in the month. Mr Sunak was quizzed about his fast food favourites In his ITV interview, the former chancellor was also asked about a photograph he recently posted on Instagram of himself paying at a McDonald's self-service machine. After his spring statement in March, he was filmed struggling to use his bank card to buy petrol. Pressed on what he ordered at McDonald's, Mr Sunak said he bought breakfast. ""I get bacon roll with ketchup and the pancakes. ""If I'm with my daughters then we get the wrap. My eldest daughter, we get the wraps. ""If I'm with her they're wrapped with a hash brown and everything in it."" On social media, some people have pointed out that the fast food chain has not served breakfast wraps since March 2020, when it reduced its menu in response to the Covid pandemic. A source on Mr Sunak's campaign later said: ""Rishi has barely seen his kids in the last two-and-a-half years since he became chancellor so there has been almost no opportunity to share a McDonald's with them. ""He's hoping they might consider bringing the breakfast wrap back on the menu.""

"Tuition fees in England and Wales will rise next year, after universities called for help with their finances. What are the changes and does getting a degree pay for itself through higher future earnings? The annual cost of an undergraduate degree in England and Wales will go up from Â£9,250 to Â£9,535 in the 2025/26 academic year. The changes will apply from 1 August 2025. Undergraduate students will also be able to borrow more for day-to-day living costs. The maximum maintenance loan for students from England, who live away from their parents outside of London, for example, will increase from Â£10,227 to Â£10,544 a year. The rise was first announced in England, where the government said the increases to tuition fees and maintenance loans were in line with inflation. The Welsh government then said it would bring fees in line with England. University tuition fees set to rise in England Welsh tuition fees to rise by nearly Â£300 a year Everything you need to know about student loans Warnings have been mounting about the state of university finances. The regulator in England, the Office for Students, warned that 40% of universities have predicted a deficit in this academic year. Inflation means tuition fees are worth less than they used to be, and there have been fewer international students to make up the financial shortfall. Students have been warned they could see cuts to staffing and courses as a result. Universities UK, which represents 141 universities,suggested in September that funding per student would have to be Â£12,500to meet universities' tuition costs - although it stressed it would not call for the tuition fee cap to be set that high. Announcing the tuition fee rise in England, Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson said there were ""severe financial challenges"" in higher education: ""With tuition fees frozen, universities have suffered real terms-decline in income."" However, the government has also said universities should ""manage their budgets"". UK nations set their own fees. In Northern Ireland, the maximum annual cost of an undergraduate degree is  Â£4,750 for Northern Irish students or Â£9,250 for other UK students. In Scotland, undergraduate tuition is free for the majority of Scottish students and Â£9,250 for other UK students. Student rents have risen sharply in recent years,according to data from 10 university towns and cities.,external Average annual rent rose from Â£6,520 in 2021-22 to Â£7,475 in 2023-24, according to research by the Higher Education Policy Institute (Hepi) and housing charity Unipol. The figures do not include London and Edinburgh. Student rents were particularly high in some cities like Bristol and Nottingham, where the average cost was Â£9,200 and Â£8,427 respectively. Hepi warned that maintenance loans in England only just cover average rent, and without family support or part-time work, students ""will have no money to live off"" after paying housing costs. If you are leaving home to study, it is generally cheaper to live in university-owned accommodation. In 2021-22(the latest UK-wide figures available),externalaverage rent for university owned rooms ranged from Â£6,471 in England to Â£4,565 in Northern Ireland. 'I got into uni but had nowhere to live' Students also need to budget for other big expenses, such as food, transport, course materials and going out. Research by the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service (Ucas), based on a survey of about 500 respondents, suggests thatstudents spent Â£219 per week on average in late 2022.,external In June 2023,Hepi said that more than half of students had a job. Most UK students are eligible for a tuition fee loan. Maintenance loans are also available for living costs. These are means-tested, so the amount you get depends on your family's income. The maximum maintenance loan if you live away from home and outside London ranges from Â£10,227 in England (before next year's increase) to Â£6,776 in Northern Ireland. You are charged interest on your total loan from the day you take it out. Eligibility and repayment rules differ across the UK. Loan repayment rules changed in England in 2023, meaning students are likely to pay back more, over a longer period of time, than those who went to university earlier. The government says new students ""will not repay more than they originally borrowed over the lifetime of their loans, when adjusted for inflation"". But MoneySavingExpert.com's Martin Lewis said extending the repayment periodwould increase ""costs by thousands"" for lower and mid-earners.,external Gov.uk - student finance calculator,external Everything you need to know about student loans Eligible students in Wales and Northern Ireland can claim maintenance grants which do not have to be repaid. Full-time undergraduates normally resident in Wales areentitled to at least Â£1,000.,externalStudents from the poorest backgrounds who study in London can get up to Â£10,124. In Northern Irelandthe maximum grant is Â£3,475.,external The Scottish government offersfinancial support to certain categories of students,,externalsuch as those with dependants. Across the UK, students in financial difficulty can apply for hardship funding and they may also be entitled tofinancial assistance from charities.,external Most students will leave university owing money. The Student Loans Company says graduates in England leave university with average debts of Â£48,470. In general, most graduates can expect to earn more than non-graduates,according to the Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA).,external However, it suggests the amount of extra money earned after a university education has declined. According to HESA's survey of 2020-21 graduates, the average salary reported 15 monthsafter gaining a degree was Â£29,699.,external Earnings also depend on the subject studied and university attended. Research by the IFS think tank,externalin England suggests, on average, women who studied creative arts and languages degrees earned the same amount in their lifetime as if they had not gone to university. Women who studied law, economics or medicine earned over Â£250,000 more during their career than if they had not got a degree. Men who studied creative arts on average earned less across their lifetimes than if they had not attended university. Male medicine or economics graduates earned Â£500,000 more. Attending university can help students from poorer backgrounds earn more than their parents might have done, according toresearch by education charity the Sutton Trust,externalin England. But only a fifth of graduates who were eligible for free school meals went on to be in the top 20% of earners - compared toalmost half of graduates who attended private schools.,external The Sutton Trust says attending a selective university, like a Russell Group one, gives young people the ""best chance of being socially mobile"".

"Peter Coshan was last seen in Edinburgh on 11 August Two men have appeared in court charged with the murder of a former Fettes College teacher. Paul Black, 63, and Paul McNaughton, 27, have also been charged with attempting to defeat the ends of justice and theft. Former biology teacher Dr Peter Coshan, 75, has been missing since he was last seen in Edinburgh on 11 August. The accused men made no plea when they appeared in private at Edinburgh Sheriff Court. Both Mr Black and Mr McNaughton were remanded in custody and their next court appearance will be before Friday 26 August. Detectives confirmed on Wednesday they were treating Dr Coshan's disappearance as murder although no body has been found. Colleagues have described the retired teacher as an inspiration who will be remembered fondly. A spokeswoman for the Edinburgh school - which counts ex-prime minister Tony Blair among its former pupils - said staff were ""shocked and deeply saddened to hear of the tragic developments"". She added that thoughts were with his loved ones. Former PM Tony Blair was a pupil at the prestigious private school in Edinburgh Helen Harrison, head of Fettes College, added: ""Peter was an inspirational biology teacher and he will be remembered fondly by many. ""Not least by those who were taught by him, tutored by him and introduced to the hills through his enthusiasm for the Duke of Edinburgh Award Scheme, which he ran for 33 years."" Dr Coshan taught at the prestigious private school from 1972 until his retirement in 2005. He joined a year after former PM Tony Blair attended the school, from 1966 to 1971. The former teacher was last seen in the Seafield Road area of Edinburgh on 11 August and was reported missing the next day. His home in Stockbridge is four miles from where he was last seen. Det Supt Andrew Patrick said extensive inquiries were ongoing to trace Dr Coshan. He added: ""I would encourage anyone with any information regarding Peter's disappearance to contact police as a matter of urgency. ""We have also set up a website that gives members of the public access to aform to send information,externaldirectly to the Major Investigation Team.""

"Rubbish piles up on Edinburgh streets on the first day of the strike People living in Edinburgh have been warned to expect ""significant disruption"" as the city's waste workers have launched a 12-day strike. Unions haverejected a pay offer equivalent to a 3.5% increaseand the Edinburgh strike is the first of a series planned across Scotland. The industrial action comes in the final weeks of the Edinburgh festivals. Workers picketing outside Edinburgh City Chambers were joined by council leader Cammy Day. The Labour councillor saidmore money was needed from the Scottish governmentto allow a better offer to be made to the striking workers. Nicola Sturgeon has said council leaders should make a 5% pay offer to staff to avert further strikes. Scottish council workers reject pay offer from Cosla Inflation drives fastest fall in real pay on record The first minister said it was ""really disappointing"" that Â£140m of extra Scottish government funding had not resolved the pay row. Hundreds of GMB and Unite union members in Edinburgh's waste and recycling service will be on strike until 30 August - the day after the end of the city's International and Fringe festivals. Bins overflow as festival visitors gather at Hunter Square A recycling point on Edinburgh's Grassmarket is strewn with cardboard waste They will be joined by further strike action from workers in waste and recycling services across Scottish local government on 26 and 29 August, as well as between 7 and 10 September. GMB Scotland organiser Kirsten Muat has warned of huge disruption to life in Scotland's capital city. She said: ""Waste will pile up for the remainder of the Festival and when people ask why we will tell them, GMB members are not prepared to accept working poverty in our local services as an inevitability even if our political leaders are. ""The 3.5% tabled last week - a miserly lift on the previously rejected 2%  - is a pathetic response while our members struggle against double-digit inflation and energy bills rising to over Â£4,000 this winter. ""If political leaders want to avoid the prospect of more strikes across more councils in the weeks to come, then they must urgently make a significantly improved pay offer."" The Edinburgh strike will be followed by a second wave of action by waste workers across Scotland. It is a coordinated effort by Unite, Unison and the GMB unions to get an improved council pay deal. Unite - 24 to 31 AugustAberdeen, Angus, Clackmannanshire, Dundee, East Ayrshire, East Lothian, East Renfrewshire, Edinburgh, Falkirk, Glasgow, Highland, Inverclyde, South Ayrshire, South Lanarkshire and West Lothian. Unison - August 26 to 29 and September 7 to 10Aberdeenshire, Clackmannanshire, East Renfrewshire, Glasgow, Inverclyde, North Lanarkshire, Stirling and South Lanarkshire GMB - August 26 to 29 and September 7 to 10Aberdeen, Angus, Dundee, East Ayrshire, East Lothian, Falkirk, Glasgow, Inverclyde, Highland, Midlothian, Orkney, South Ayrshire, South Lanarkshire, West Lothian, Perth and Kinross, and North Lanarkshire. Eddie Cassidy, from Unite Scotland, toldBBC Radio's Good Morning Scotlandthat councils were an ""an easy target"" for Scottish government cuts. ""They have reduced funding for local government well in excess of what they should have over the past 10 years,"" he said. ""My members have been scrimping and scraping over the past ten years, and the time has come to say enough is enough. ""They cant afford to buy their messages, they can't afford to send their kids to school, they cannot afford their bus fares. It's an absolute disgrace in a country like ours."" Union members rally outside Edinburgh's city council chambers Edinburgh City Council said it was anticipating all bin collections and street cleaning in the city would be affected in the coming weeks. The city's three recycling centres will be closed and bulky uplift and fly-tipping services will also be paused as a result of the action. As agreed with the trade unions, some waste collections will take place in care homes, special schools and blocks of flats with bin chutes. Council leader Cammy Day said: ""I firmly believe that all council colleagues deserve to be paid fairly for the work they do and have every right to take this action and have their voices heard. ""As the lowest funded council in Scotland, it's time for the Scottish government to properly fund our capital city and its services."" Last week Cosla resources spokeswoman Katie Hagmann said: ""Leaders have reaffirmed their aspiration to make an offer greater than the initial 2% but note the risk that public services will not recover, jobs will be affected and communities will see services reduced."" The Scottish government said it expected local government to match its Â£140m contribution to help them give staff a bigger pay rise. Meanwhile, Scotland will also be hit by disruption on the railways on Thursday, with strike action by the RMT union across the UK impacting on the signalling provisions north of the border. As a result only a few train services will be available, mostly in the central belt.

"Ryan Giggs told a police officer he hit his ex in the lip, the court heard Ryan Giggs told a police officer he hit his ex ""in the lip"" and also tried to stop her sister calling 999, a court has heard. The former Manchester United player, who denies all charges, gave evidence on a second day of cross-examination. The jury heard the football star's statement to police where he said: ""I've hit her (Kate) in the lip."" During the call made by her sister Emma he was heard by 999 staff berating his ex for ""causing all of this"". Giggs cries in court and denies headbutting ex I'm a love cheat, but I never hit women - Giggs The former Wales international and manager, 48, denies using controlling and coercive behaviour and assaulting Kate Greville, 38. He also denies causing her actual bodily harm, and common assault of Kate Greville's younger sister, Emma Greville. On Thursday at Manchester Crown Court, he was taken through the prepared statement he gave to the police the morning after the alleged assaults on Kate and Emma Greville in November 2020. Mr Wright said: ""You were seeking to create a narrative that didn't properly or fairly describe what had gone on?"" Mr Giggs said: ""No."" Mr Wright said he wanted to create a story in which he was the one who had been attacked and not them. Mr Giggs denied that. Mr Wright also pointed to part of the statement where Mr Giggs said  he accepted ""my head clashed with hers"". ""You headbutted her, didn't you?"" said Mr Wright. ""No,"" said Mr Giggs. The footballing star also admitted berating his ex's sister, Emma for calling the police ""You had completely lost your self control?"" ""No,"" said Mr Giggs, who also denied headbutting Emma Greville. Mr Wright also asked if Mr Giggs ""berated"" and ""chastised"" Emma Greville for calling the police, which he admitted. Mr Wright referred Mr Giggs to his screaming and shouting in the background of the 999 call Emma Greville made. The call operator heard Mr Giggs telling his ex ""you... caused this"". ""Until the police arrived, you were going to be angry and aggressive?"" he was asked. ""No,"" he said. Giggs' ex screamed in pain on 999 call, court told I was slave to Giggs' demands, ex tells court But he agreed his demeanour changed by the time the police arrived and were speaking to him. He was then referred to how, later, when telling the officer what had happened, he said: ""I've hit her in the lip."" Ryan Giggs has denied being controlling or coercive with his ex-girlfriend ""Why not say it was an accident?"" asked Mr Wright. ""I don't know,"" he replied. Mr Wright said it was because he was saying what had happened. ""You had assaulted her, hadn't you?"" Mr Giggs said: ""No."" Mr Wright asked Mr Giggs why he could be heard saying ""all losers"" during the 999 call made by Emma Greville. Mr Giggs said he ""did not know"" why he would refer to both women as losers. Mr Wright then told him: ""I'm going to suggest it was because you realised what you had done and you were going to be arrested."" Mr Giggs said: ""No."" Mr Wright accused Mr Giggs of preparing to ""get your story straight"" as he waited outside his house for the arrival of police officers. He also alleged the ex-footballer wanted to give the impression he was pleased they were arriving, which he also denied. He reminded Mr Giggs that Emma Greville told police during the 999 call: ""He is screaming and shouting."" Mr Giggs said he ""did not know"" he was screaming and shouting when asked by the prosecution but no-one else was there. The court heard that Giggs told police at the house ""she is going to say I attacked her"" and that Kate Greville's sister Emma ""will obviously be on her side"". He also denied blaming Kate Greville for the dispute and told the police at his house that she had taken his phone, so he was not giving hers back. He denied being ""angry and aggressive to Ms Greville"" and he believed the sisters would tell the police he had headbutted Kate, which he denied. Mr Giggs also admitted he was ""just scared"" about these accusations. Asked what he thought might happen, Mr Giggs replied: ""I'm not too sure, but it just didn't look good."" Asked what he had meant by saying ""we'll be everywhere"", Mr Giggs said: ""The newspapers and the media."" Ryan Giggs told his barrister Chris Daw QC both he and Kate Greville would block each other online in the course of their relationship. He said it was also ""common"" for them to exchange intimate photographs of each other but he had never threatened to share any of Kate Greville with anyone else. They would also exchange love poems, the court heard. In August 2017, she messaged him: ""You make my heart flutter because you are a nutter."" The next day, Mr Giggs wrote: ""I'm not gonna lie, I think of you, I dream of you. Can't help thinking, pulling you was my greatest ever coo [sic]."" Mr Giggs also accepted he would send messages to Kate Greville and her friends when she was looking to break up with him on several occasions during their six-year relationship. When asked whether he was seeking to control Kate Greville he told the court: ""To try to rekindle the relationship."" Mr Daw said: ""What was Kate's reaction?"" Mr Giggs said: ""She was happy that I persisted and I fought for her."" He also said his ""unannounced visits"" to Kate Greville at times when they had broken up was to ""just to try and see her"" and ""rekindle the relationship"" and that Kate was ""just happy that I had fought for us and that I had persisted"". Chris Daw QC asked Ryan Giggs about messages he sent to Kate Greville with ""deeply unpleasant language"" after she told him he would no longer be going on a trip to Scotland with her. He added that he only remembered using that language one time. Mr Giggs replied: ""Because I was upset, I was looking forward to going to the trip. I was on a big high and then a big low."" He also admitted that he had a private and public persona but neither of them involved using violence. The trial continues.

Today's coverage was brought to you by Alys Davies, Aoife Walsh, George Wright, James FitzGerald, Heather Sharp and Alex Therrien. The leaders of Turkey, Ukraine and the UN held a press conference after talks We'll be bringing our coverage to today's events in Ukraine to a close soon, but first, here's a look back at some key developments. Explosions hit an area near a Russian military airport in the annexed Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea on Thursday, according to Reuters. At least four explosions struck the airport of Belbek, north of Sevastopol, the news agency reported, citing three local sources. Ukraine has not confirmed it was behind the attack and the BBC cannot independently verify the claim. The explosions follow a string of attacks against Russian military sites and equipment in Crimea over the last week, which Ukraine has not claimed responsibility for.

Volodymyr Zelensky says he and UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres have agreed the parameters of a possible
mission of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to the
Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant. Following talks with Turkey's
leader and Guterres in Lviv,
Zelensky told a news conference Russia should immediately
withdraw its forces and stop shelling from the nuclear power
plant. He said a possible IAEA visit should be done ""legally via territory free from the occupiers"". Ukraineâs representative to the IAEA told the BBC a team of inspectors must be allowed into the facility as soon as possible. Yevhenii Tsymbaliuk said the best option would be to remove Russian forces and weapons from the site - the largest nuclear complex in Europe - and for Ukrainians to regain full control of the power plant. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has ruled out a peace deal with Russia unless it withdraws its troops from Ukraine. Speaking after talks with Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres in Lviv, Zelensky told reporters he was ""very surprised"" to hear from the Turkish leader that Russia was ""ready for some kind of peace"". He adds: ""First they should leave our territory and then we'll see."" The death toll in Kharkiv, in north-eastern Ukraine, has increased to 17 people after Russian shelling hit a number of residential buildings, according to local governor Oleh Synehubov. As well as the 10 people who had already been pronounced dead, rescuers have now recovered a further seven bodies from the rubble, Synehubov wrote in a message on Telegram. Among the dead was a boy born in 2009, he added. Forty-two people were also injured in the rocket attacks, he said. Attacks also hit the city of Krasnograd in the Kharkiv region - where a couple were killed and their 12-year-old daughter was seriously injured, Mr Synehubov said. Hugo BachegaBBC News, Dnipro The UN and Turkey helped broker the only diplomatic
breakthrough in this war so far - a deal that allowed Ukraine to resume its
exports after a months-long Russian blockade that led to a global food crisis. Antonio Guterres, the UN Secretary General, was personally involved in the
negotiations; Turkey is hosting the centre that co-ordinates the deal,
including with inspections of ships. Itâs a delicate arrangement. After meeting the Ukrainian and Turkish
presidents, Guterres urged all sides to continue working âin good faithâ for
the deal to hold. President
Erdogan of Turkey said the grain deal could form the basis for peace talks
between Ukraine and Russia. But few share the enthusiasm. President Zelensky
said negotiations can only start after Russia leaves territory it invaded. Their
talks in Lviv were overshadowed by the tensions around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear
power plant, hundreds of miles away. They all expressed concern that the
military activity around the station could result in a catastrophe. Thereâs
hope diplomacy can solve this crisis too, although there are no signs of it
yet. Employees of Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant have said they are ""powerless"" in the face of ""human irresponsibility and madness"". They've warned of a potential nuclear catastrophe at the facility, saying in the past two weeks it has become ""the
target of continuous military attacks"". ""Artillery strikes are becoming more and
more powerful and dangerous every time,"" they say. The plant, the largest in Europe, has been occupied by Russian forces since March, though its Ukrainian staff have continued with daily operations. The message from the workers does not name either Russia or Ukraine, which have both blamed each other for shelling near the plant. Some of the facility's 10,000 staff are being injured or killed at work, they add, in theappeal published on the Telegram messaging app,external. ""Stop and think!... What is happening is horrific and beyond common sense and morality,"" they write, warning that an accident could be worse than the nuclear disasters at Chernobyl and Fukushima. ""We know how to professionally manage a nuclear reaction, but are powerless
before human irresponsibility and madness,"" they say. The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant has been occupied by Russian forces since March Ukraine's main intelligence agency has accused Russia of planning to stage a ""provocation"" at the Zaporizhzhia power plant. Moscow wants to ""raise the stakes"", a Telegram post from the agency alleges. It claims that Russia is planning a terrorist attack at the site which will be blamed on Kyiv. The plant, the largest in Europe, has been under Russian control since March. The post says that representatives from the Rosatom, the Russian state nuclear corporation, had suddenly left the site. Earlier, Russia made its own accusation that Kyiv was plotting an incident which it could blame on Moscow. Hugo BachegaBBC News, Kyiv We've been hearing Turkey's President Recep Erodgan and UN chief Antonio Guterres warn about the dangers of the situation at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is accusing Russia of ânuclear blackmailâ over tensions at the complex, Europeâs largest. Officials here claim Russia is creating this crisis to try to force Ukraine and other countries to comply with their conditions. Ukraine says Russia has deployed around 500 forces to the complex, who are using it as a shield to launch attacks against Ukrainian towns. Russia, on the other hand, denies the accusations, and says its troops are, in fact, protecting the plant. For days, Russia and Ukraine have accused each other of shelling near the site, fuelling fears of a nuclear catastrophe. Itâs hard to independently verify the allegations, as the plant is off limits. The facility has been under Russian occupation since early March, although Ukrainian technicians still operate it. Theyâre working under pressure, and there are claimssome have been detained, tortured and beaten. UN chief Antonio Guterres says damage to the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine would be ""suicide"". Speaking to reporters after talks in Lviv, Guterres says he was ""gravely concerned"" about the situation at the plant and said it had to be demilitarised. He says: ""We must tell it like it is - any potential damage to Zaporizhzhia is suicide."" Guterres adds the facility must not be used as part of ""any military
operation"" and that ""agreement is urgently needed to re-establish
Zaporizhzhia's purely civilian infrastructure and to ensure the
safety of the area"". Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has said the world doesn't want ""another Chernobyl"", warning of the possibility of a nuclear accident at Zaporizhzhia if conflict there continues. He's been speaking at a press conference in Lviv, following talks with his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky and UN chief Antonio Guterres. Erdogan says the trio also discussed ways to end the war between Russia and Ukraine. He says they discussed the exchange of prisoners of war
between Ukraine and Russia, and that he would later raise the
issue with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Turkey has recently acted as a mediator between the two countries, including on the issue of unblocking grain exports from Ukraine's ports. Will VernonBBC News, Moscow The Russian defence ministryâs statement earlier today can be summarised in two words: Blame Ukraine. During press briefing at the ministryâs imposing building in central Moscow, Lt-Gen Igor Kirillov, who is head of Russiaâs radioactive, chemical and biological defence forces, gave a presentation in which he accused the Ukrainians of endangering theZaporizhzhia nuclear plant,which Russian forces control. He claimed the plant's back-up support systems had been damaged as a result of Ukrainian shelling, and that Kyiv was planning a provocation â an âindustrial disasterâ â at the power plant on Friday, the same day that UN Secretary General Guterres visits the Ukrainian port city of Odesa. During his presentation, Lt-Gen Kirillov presented a slide that showed how radioactive material would spread over Germany, Poland and Slovakia in the event of an accident at the plant. We see this kind of narrative almost daily in Russia, both in official statements and on state-controlled TV. Moscow says Ukraine is guilty of everything from shelling civilian areas and committing war crimes, to planning nuclear meltdowns. At the same time, it fails to mention that it was Russia that invaded Ukraine and occupied its territory, and it is Russian troops that are accused of committing atrocities. The latest warning is likely more distraction tactics by Moscow. By stressing the risks of a nuclear accident and decrying the alleged âcrimesâ of the Ukrainian government (as Moscow sees it), the authorities can draw the publicâs attention away from the Russian armyâs poor performance on the battlefield. Russian forces have barely seized more than a handful of villages in Ukraine in the last month, whilst casualties are mounting. UN Secretary General
Antonio Guterres has urged Moscow and Kyiv to show a
""spirit of compromise"" and ensure the continued success of the grain deal that enabled the resumption of grain exports from Ukraine. Speaking at a press conference after talks in Lviv with Ukraine and Turkey's leaders, Guterres tells reporters that 21 ships had departed from Ukrainian ports under the
deal in less than a month, and 15 vessels had left Istanbul for
Ukraine to load up with grain and other food supplies. He adds: ""But it is only the beginning. I urge all parties to ensure
continued success. ""From day one, the parties have worked professionally and in
good faith to keep the food flowing. I appeal for this to
continue and for them to overcome all obstacles in a spirit of
compromise and permanently settle all difficulties."" He also reiterated his plea for the demilitarisation of
the nuclear power plant held by Russian forces in Zaporizhzhia, saying he was gravely concerned
by the situation in and around it. Russia has dismissed the proposal, claiming it would make the facility ""more vulnerable"". A Russian foreign ministry spokesperson has said that while a clash with the collective West is possible, a direct nuclear conflict with the US and Nato would not be in Russia's interests. ""Russia has never sabre-rattled weapons, especially nuclear weapons. But the events in Ukraine... clearly show that a clash with the collective West is quite real,"" Ivan Nechayev said, as reported by the Interfax news agency. Moscow is ""committed to the principle that there can be no winners in a nuclear war, and it should never be unleashed"", he said. ""Russia, as a nuclear power, will continue to act as responsibly as possible. A direct clash with the US and Nato is not in our interests. ""Russian military doctrine allows a nuclear response only in response to aggression using weapons of mass destruction, or when the very existence of the state is threatened."" We're hearing more now from the talks between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and UN chief Antonio Guterres. Zelensky says the two leaders discussed grain, after exports from Ukraine resumed this month following a landmark deal brokered by the UN and Turkey. Tonnes of grain had been stuck in Ukraine because of Russian blockades, leading to shortages and higher food prices in other countries. ""We agreed to continue the coordination of the grain initiative implementation. We also discussed the possible directions of its development,"" Zelensky says.

"Allen Weisselberg worked for former President Donald Trump for decades (file image) The long-time financial chief of Donald Trump's company has pleaded guilty to fraud and tax evasion charges at a New York court. Allen Weisselberg, who served as The Trump Organization's chief financial officer, had been charged with concealing more than $1.7m (Â£1.4m) in off-the-books income. He is expected to be sentenced to five months at the notorious Rikers Island jail and must pay back the owed money. Mr Trump has not been charged. The former president - who is not accused of wrongdoing - has described the Manhattan district attorney's criminal investigation into his family's real estate company as a witch hunt. The case relates to a 15-year scheme that prosecutors said helped executives at The Trump Organization avoid paying taxes on corporate benefits such as rent, luxury car payments and private school fees. The inquiry focused on whether Weisselberg and other executives received these benefits without reporting them properly on their tax returns. And at the plea hearing on Thursday, the 75-year-old admitted his involvement in the scheme and to receiving private school tuition for his grandchildren, BMW cars and a home in Manhattan. ""[He] decided to enter a plea of guilty today to put an end to this case and the years-long legal and personal nightmares it has caused for him and his family,"" his lawyer said in a statement shortly after. How big are Trump's legal problems? Could documents probe stop him running in 2024? Tales from inside New York's notorious jail Weisselberg, who is seen as one of Mr Trump's most loyal business associates, worked for the former president for almost 50 years. He left his job as chief financial officer which he had held since 2005 when he was arrested last year. The Trump Organization is also a defendant in this case and its lawyers have entered a not guilty plea. Weisselberg must now testify against the company at a criminal trial later this year, after agreeing to a plea deal that was first reported by The New York Times. But he refused to co-operate with prosecutors in their wider investigation into Donald Trump and his business practices, reports say. That means any testimony he provides at the trial - which is scheduled for late October - will only relate to this case and will not implicate the former president directly. Weisselberg had faced intense pressure from prosecutors to co-operate against Mr Trump, The New York Times reported, but resisted and accepted jail time instead. He will be sentenced at the end of The Trump Organization trial, Judge Juan Merchan said on Thursday. He could be freed from a likely five-month sentence after 100 days if time is credited for good behaviour, a number of sources told US media. That is far shorter than the many years in state prison he could have faced if - rather than plead guilty - he were convicted at trial. Weisselberg's guilty plea - which legal experts suggest will strengthen the case against The Trump Organization - comes as Mr Trump is investigated on several fronts. Just last week, he declined to answer questions as part of a separate New York state investigation into his family's business practices. That inquiry is a civil one, meaning it will not result in criminal charges. Mr Trump, who denies wrongdoing, had sued in an effort to block the interview at the attorney general's office. But the questioning lasted around four hours and Mr Trump - who invoked his Fifth Amendment rights - said ""same answer"" throughout. ""[This is] unlikely to have any real impact on Trump personally,"" Joseph Moreno, a former federal prosecutor, told the BBC. ""Weisselberg is obligated to testify against the Trump Organization if called, so that could lead to trouble, but if anything probably civil not criminal."" There are also separate investigations into the former president's handling of classified documents -which led the FBI to search his Florida home- and others related to his efforts to undermine the result of the 2020 presidential election.

"Some medical students have been using food banks, the British Medical Association's medical students committee says Questions are being asked why the government is sticking to its cap on medical and dentistry places. A shortage of doctors and other medical staff has been described as the biggest challenge facing the NHS. But the number of places at UK medical schools are capped - in England this year there are 7,500 places. England's Education Secretary James Cleverly told the BBC that you can't just ""flick a switch"" to increase the capacity to train more doctors. Students offered incentive to delay medical degree We can't live on NHS bursary, say medical students How much will university cost me? Medicine is one of a handful of courses where numbers are limited by the government, because the cost is heavily subsidised. In 2020 and 2021 the government lifted the cap on numbers, which last year led to more than 10,000 places being accepted. But this year the cap in England is being reintroduced. Mr Cleverly told the BBC that the nature of highly technical, vocational courses like medicine meant increasing the number of places was far from straightforward. ""To increase those numbers you would also need to increase the capacity in training institutions, both in universities and in hospitals. ""It is not something you can just flick a switch and significantly increase the capacity to train. ""The increases have got to be funded, they are technical and expensive courses and we need to understand the balance of requirements between these courses and other courses that the government is supporting financially."" There is an added complication for those trying to win a place at medical school this year. High demand in 2021 meant there were a number of students who had to defer starting their training until this year. It has created a very competitive field for places this summer. The government has increased the cap on places since 2017, but the Medical Schools Council is calling for a long-term increase in the number of medical school places to meet the demand in the NHS. But there are good reasons for a cap on places existing. Training doctors and dentists costs the government much more than students pay in fees. Add to that the need for good quality clinical placements to be made available for students during their training and there is an in-built limit to what the system can cope with. But the pressure caused by staff shortages in the NHS combined with the length of time it takes to train a fully qualified doctor - typically seven years - means this is an issue that will be around for some years to come.

"Train passengers have been facing more disruption, with only 20% of services running on Thursday due to strikes. Half of Britain's lines are closed as more than 45,000 rail workers walk out in a row over pay, jobs and conditions. Some routes have no services, and where they are operating, trains will only run between 07:30 and 18:30 BST. Another strike is scheduled for Saturday. Passengers are being told only to travel by train if necessary. It is the latest in a series of summer strikes and will alter the travel plans for workers, festival-goers and those heading to the cricket Test match at Lord's in London. Mick Lynch, general secretary of the Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union has warned that the dispute could go on ""indefinitely"" unless a pay settlement is reached. In a letter to the transport secretary, he accused the government of using taxpayers' money to ""bail out"" private train companies, helping them to avoid being liable for revenue lost due to strike action. ""The same companies comply with government instructions to hold down pay, cut thousands of safety critical rail jobs, introduce driver-only trains and close ticket offices across the network"", Mr Lynch added. A spokesperson for the Department for Transport said: ""Yet again, for the sixth time since June, union leaders are opting to inflict misery and disrupt the day-to-day lives of millions instead of working with industry to agree a deal that will bring our railways into the 21st century."" When are the train and Tube strikes? How much are rail workers paid? Strikes to disrupt almost all ScotRail services A total of 4,300 services are expected to run across the country on Thursday and Saturday, according to track operator Network Rail. This is the highest number yet during the series of national RMT strikes. However, it is still only just over a fifth of usual service levels. Some places, including Portsmouth, Swansea and Blackpool, will have no trains at all and there will be no services running north of Falkirk. Services will also finish earlier. The last train from London to Edinburgh on Thursday, for example, left at 14:00, while the last train to Leeds left at 15:05. Trains will also start later than usual on the days following strikes. The involvement of Network Rail signal workers across England, Wales and Scotland makes the RMT strike particularly disruptive. RMT general secretary Mick Lynch joined a picket line outside London's Euston station It is not possible to run trains without signallers, and only a fraction can run with the available contingency staffing. Network Rail owns and manages most of the UK's rail infrastructure. If customers are not able to travel on Thursday or Saturday, the Rail Delivery Group - which represents operators - said they can use these tickets either the day before or up to and including 23 August. Otherwise customers will be able to change the ticket or claim a refund. Thursday's strikes involve members of the RMT at 14 train operators, TSSA (Transport Salaried Staffs' Association) members at seven companies and Unite members at Network Rail. Network Rail's chief executive Andrew Haines described negotiations with unions as ""slow"" and ""painful"" and said there was ""an absolute lack of clarity over what it would take for this strike to be called off"". Luke Chester, organising director at the TSSA, said: ""The reality is that what we need to resolve this dispute is a pay rise which reflects the cost of living increase that is affecting most people in this country very severely."" Meanwhile, on Friday both the London Underground and Overground will be affected by RMT strike action, in a separate dispute over pensions and pay. Transport for London said people should avoid the Tube, which will have little or no services running, and only use the rest of the network if essential. It advised bus services may also be affected as drivers take part in a strike called by Unite the union. Today is the start of four days of reduced services in a row, because strike day disruption spills over into later-starting trains the next day. The rail industry says these national scale strikes cost them up to Â£30m a day. And three weeks on from the previous national scale RMT strike, resolutions to the ongoing disputes over pay and conditions don't appear much closer. One cohort of managers who are in the TSSA have come to a pay agreement with Network Rail - but other groups in the union haven't reached deals with their employers. Last month, the RMT rejected Network's Rail's latest pay offer despite their insistence that the union should put it to their members first. Talks since then haven't produced an agreement to prevent these latest walkouts going ahead. When it comes to the train companies, even less progress has been made. Unions have repeatedly accused the government of not enabling effective negotiations, but the transport secretary has insisted only employers and unions can settle their disputes.

"Peter Coshan was last seen in Edinburgh on 11 August Two men have appeared in court charged with the murder of a former Fettes College teacher. Paul Black, 63, and Paul McNaughton, 27, have also been charged with attempting to defeat the ends of justice and theft. Former biology teacher Dr Peter Coshan, 75, has been missing since he was last seen in Edinburgh on 11 August. The accused men made no plea when they appeared in private at Edinburgh Sheriff Court. Both Mr Black and Mr McNaughton were remanded in custody and their next court appearance will be before Friday 26 August. Detectives confirmed on Wednesday they were treating Dr Coshan's disappearance as murder although no body has been found. Colleagues have described the retired teacher as an inspiration who will be remembered fondly. A spokeswoman for the Edinburgh school - which counts ex-prime minister Tony Blair among its former pupils - said staff were ""shocked and deeply saddened to hear of the tragic developments"". She added that thoughts were with his loved ones. Former PM Tony Blair was a pupil at the prestigious private school in Edinburgh Helen Harrison, head of Fettes College, added: ""Peter was an inspirational biology teacher and he will be remembered fondly by many. ""Not least by those who were taught by him, tutored by him and introduced to the hills through his enthusiasm for the Duke of Edinburgh Award Scheme, which he ran for 33 years."" Dr Coshan taught at the prestigious private school from 1972 until his retirement in 2005. He joined a year after former PM Tony Blair attended the school, from 1966 to 1971. The former teacher was last seen in the Seafield Road area of Edinburgh on 11 August and was reported missing the next day. His home in Stockbridge is four miles from where he was last seen. Det Supt Andrew Patrick said extensive inquiries were ongoing to trace Dr Coshan. He added: ""I would encourage anyone with any information regarding Peter's disappearance to contact police as a matter of urgency.

"Allen Weisselberg worked for former President Donald Trump for decades (file image) The long-time financial chief of Donald Trump's company has pleaded guilty to fraud and tax evasion charges at a New York court. Allen Weisselberg, who served as The Trump Organization's chief financial officer, had been charged with concealing more than $1.7m (Â£1.4m) in off-the-books income. He is expected to be sentenced to five months at the notorious Rikers Island jail and must pay back the owed money. Mr Trump has not been charged. The former president - who is not accused of wrongdoing - has described the Manhattan district attorney's criminal investigation into his family's real estate company as a witch hunt. The case relates to a 15-year scheme that prosecutors said helped executives at The Trump Organization avoid paying taxes on corporate benefits such as rent, luxury car payments and private school fees. The inquiry focused on whether Weisselberg and other executives received these benefits without reporting them properly on their tax returns. And at the plea hearing on Thursday, the 75-year-old admitted his involvement in the scheme and to receiving private school tuition for his grandchildren, BMW cars and a home in Manhattan. ""[He] decided to enter a plea of guilty today to put an end to this case and the years-long legal and personal nightmares it has caused for him and his family,"" his lawyer said in a statement shortly after. How big are Trump's legal problems? Could documents probe stop him running in 2024? Tales from inside New York's notorious jail Weisselberg, who is seen as one of Mr Trump's most loyal business associates, worked for the former president for almost 50 years. He left his job as chief financial officer which he had held since 2005 when he was arrested last year. The Trump Organization is also a defendant in this case and its lawyers have entered a not guilty plea. Weisselberg must now testify against the company at a criminal trial later this year, after agreeing to a plea deal that was first reported by The New York Times. But he refused to co-operate with prosecutors in their wider investigation into Donald Trump and his business practices, reports say. That means any testimony he provides at the trial - which is scheduled for late October - will only relate to this case and will not implicate the former president directly. Weisselberg had faced intense pressure from prosecutors to co-operate against Mr Trump, The New York Times reported, but resisted and accepted jail time instead. He will be sentenced at the end of The Trump Organization trial, Judge Juan Merchan said on Thursday. He could be freed from a likely five-month sentence after 100 days if time is credited for good behaviour, a number of sources told US media. That is far shorter than the many years in state prison he could have faced if - rather than plead guilty - he were convicted at trial. Weisselberg's guilty plea - which legal experts suggest will strengthen the case against The Trump Organization - comes as Mr Trump is investigated on several fronts. Just last week, he declined to answer questions as part of a separate New York state investigation into his family's business practices. That inquiry is a civil one, meaning it will not result in criminal charges. Mr Trump, who denies wrongdoing, had sued in an effort to block the interview at the attorney general's office. But the questioning lasted around four hours and Mr Trump - who invoked his Fifth Amendment rights - said ""same answer"" throughout. ""[This is] unlikely to have any real impact on Trump personally,"" Joseph Moreno, a former federal prosecutor, told the BBC. ""Weisselberg is obligated to testify against the Trump Organization if called, so that could lead to trouble, but if anything probably civil not criminal."" There are also separate investigations into the former president's handling of classified documents -which led the FBI to search his Florida home- and others related to his efforts to undermine the result of the 2020 presidential election.

"Rishi Sunak has insisted he still has a ""shot"" at Downing Street despite polls suggesting Liz Truss has a strong lead in the Conservative leadership contest. He told ITV's This Morning he ""definitely"" had a chance of victory, while warning his rival's tax-cutting plans risked fuelling inflation. The former chancellor said his economic approach was ""honest"" and deliverable. The latest poll of Tory members pointed to 66% backing Ms Truss and 34% supporting Mr Sunak. The YouGov survey of 1,089 people for Sky News was conducted from 12-17 August. The percentages were calculated by excluding undecided members and non-voters.

In an apparent attack on Ms Truss's campaign pledges, he warned that increasing borrowing during a time of high inflation would be ""really risky"". ""It's like putting fuel on the fire and that's the mistake we made in the 70s, I don't want to repeat that mistake,"" he said. On Wednesday, it emerged the inflation rate in July had soared to 10.1%, a 40-year high. Ms Truss has argued that taxes are too high and risk ""choking off growth"". She says businesses are less likely to invest, and people are less likely to set up businesses or get jobs. Reducing taxation, the foreign secretary has said, is the best way of staving off a recession. Mr Sunak said restoring trust in government and politics was about ""under-promising and over-delivering"". ""That's why in this leadership race I've not been making lots of easy promises that I think are false, I'd rather lose than say things I don't think can be delivered, I'd rather be honest with people."" Elsewhere in his ITV interview, Mr Sunak described Boris Johnson's battle to cling to power in July as ""a bit odd"". His own resignation as chancellor helped toprompt more than 50 other members of the government to follow suit. Asked if the prime minister still talks to him, Mr Sunak said: ""No, no. I've reached out to him but understandably he's not replied. ""That's fair but it wasn't just me, at the end of the day, 60 other members of the government all resigned as well."" Ms Truss has continued to praise Mr Johnson's record as prime minister. She has now agreed to be interviewed by the BBC's Nick Robinson. The interview will be broadcast live on BBC1 on 30 August. Mr Robinsonquestioned her rivalearlier in the month. Mr Sunak was quizzed about his fast food favourites In his ITV interview, the former chancellor was also asked about a photograph he recently posted on Instagram of himself paying at a McDonald's self-service machine. After his spring statement in March, he was filmed struggling to use his bank card to buy petrol. Pressed on what he ordered at McDonald's, Mr Sunak said he bought breakfast. ""I get bacon roll with ketchup and the pancakes. ""If I'm with my daughters then we get the wrap. My eldest daughter, we get the wraps. ""If I'm with her they're wrapped with a hash brown and everything in it."" On social media, some people have pointed out that the fast food chain has not served breakfast wraps since March 2020, when it reduced its menu in response to the Covid pandemic. A source on Mr Sunak's campaign later said: ""Rishi has barely seen his kids in the last two-and-a-half years since he became chancellor so there has been almost no opportunity to share a McDonald's with them. ""He's hoping they might consider bringing the breakfast wrap back on the menu.""

"This video can not be played The idea was the brainchild of Swansea student Sophie Morgan. Student Sophie Morgan was terrified when she looked through her curtains to see a man photographing her. ""I opened the curtains and saw a man on my roof outside, filming me and staring right at me,"" recalled Sophie. That chilling moment was Sophie's catalyst to start a group that helps women who have been a victim of sexual harassment. Her group also helps women get home safely at night without feeling frightened. Sophie had heard of incidents of women being sexually harassed in Swansea. The university student thought little was being done to help women's safety, so she decided to act. The issue of women's safety was brought into sharp focus across the UK following the murders ofSarah EverardandSabina Nessain 2021. Women across the country took to social media to discuss their experiences of walking the streets and the lengths they took to feel safe. Sarah Everard had been walking to her home in the Brixton area of London when she disappeared Storiesof being followed, harassed, catcalled, assaulted and exposed toresonated with women in Sophie's group who had gone through similar ordeals. Latest figures suggesta third of UK women had experienced at least one form of harassment,externalin the last year. Primary school teacher Sabina Nessa was attacked as she walked to meet a friend in Kidbrooke, south-east London ""I was living in my student house... hearing a lot of incidents of women being sexually harassed in the street,"" remembered Sophie, talking about her own experience. How a woman's death sparked UK soul-searching Does following the 'rules' keep women safe? How many attacks on women are there? ""I was hearing of women being followed, groped, flashed and worse. ""One night in the winter, I was lying in bed and there was a noise outside my room so I opened the curtains and there was a man with his phone on the roof outside my window taking pictures. ""As soon as I opened the curtains, he jumped down and drove off. I panicked and phoned the police. Sophie Morgan and Ileana Mathias feel the authorities should do more to help protect women ""It was scary. The only confidence I did have was I was living in a student house with eight of us there - and that made it a little bit more reassuring but even when I reported it to the police, we had no success in finding who it was."" The childhood studies graduate was living in the Brynmill area of Swansea at the time of the incident. Sophie soon heard other women's testimonies of being harassed, so set up the social media group to share experiences and warn others. Sophie lived in the Brynmill area, between Swansea's city centre, seafront and the huge Singleton Park ""We were scared, confused, but thought it was time to do something about it,"" said the 24-year-old. Sophie's group now has about 1,000 members. They look out for each other - and if one of them is walking home alone at night, someone will either go out and meet them or talk on the phone until they're safely home. Sophie and Ileana have been the victim of sexual harassment in the last few years She has also helped organise women's safety protests in Swansea and has support from her local MP who has raised the group's concerns in Parliament. The Home Office also granted theSouth Wales Police Commissioner more than Â£180,000,externalthrough itsSafety of Women at Night Fund,external, to ""address issues"" of women's safety in Swansea and develop a sexual harassment campaign to change the attitude and behaviour of men. Sophie has since moved to Swansea's suburbs where she feels safer but still continues her safety campaign. ""It's become this community of women sharing their experiences in a safe space,"" added Sophie, originally from Newport. ""We warn one another if something has happened to them and generally support each other. Sophie Morgan helped organise women's safety protests in Swansea ""If someone is walking on their own and feels unsafe then they can send a message and hopefully someone will be free to go and meet them, or talk to them on the phone or just listen to them."" Swansea has alsoseen a recent rise in alleged drink spiking. One bartender, who is part of Sophie's group, said she had seen instances of drink spiking herself: ""The second alcohol gets involved, it seems to bring the worst out in people."" Ileana Mathias, 24, said she often talks to members of Sophie's group on her walk home from her job in the city's popular Wind Street. ""I find it incredibly heart-breaking that groups like this are necessary. We should be able to walk home without being scared about what could happen to us. Campaigners want improved lightning in Swansea's large Singleton Park to make it feel safer for women ""It's deeply concerning and unfortunate that we have to put these things in place because the people that are supposed to protect us don't really do that much protecting - and don't take things that seriously."" Sophie has worked with Swansea University, the local council and South Wales Police on trying to improve women's safety in the city but says women in her group tell her they ""don't feel confident going to the police, they think nothing happens"". Campaigners have called for more police patrols, a greater police presence in the city centre and improved lightning in the large Singleton Park near the centre of Swansea as Sophie says it's ""not comfortable"" walking through there in the dark. This video can not be played Watch: Can this app help to keep women safe on the streets? Sophie said her local MP has joined their protests and urged women to keep highlighting issues so he could raise them in the House of Commons. ""I heard some really awful stuff,"" said Geraint Davies, Labour MP for Swansea West. ""The common theme was these girls didn't feel they could turn to the police to report what was happening. ""The police need better training and need to believe these women when they come forward with their experiences, and don't just tell them 'oh you're drunk' and dismiss their claims. 'All I wanted was to stand with other women' Male allies needed, says women's safety campaign LISTEN: How can women feel safer? ""It's an endemic problem. There needs to be more female police officers and change of culture at the top to stamp this kind of behaviour and these incidents out of our society."" South Wales Police said tackling violence and abuse against women and girls was a ""long-standing priority"" and their Assistant Chief Constable Jenny Gilmer said the force ""recognise that concern regarding personal safety and violence is as great as it has ever been"". Detectives said all reports to police were ""extensively investigated with officers looking at CCTV, as well as speaking to victims and potential witnesses, and looking into medical evidence"". ""Every weekend we have a robust and proactive policing plan in place to protect vulnerable people, identify potential offenders and support victims, as well as providing a visible and reassuring presence in Swansea city centre,"" added local chief inspector Mark Brier. Home Office money have been granted to help ""address issues"" of women's safety in Swansea He said a project runs in the city centre on busy nights to ""provide reassurance and medical assistance to victims"" and ""improves responses to incidents of drink spiking, sexual harassment, and assault"". The Crown Prosecution Service issuednew guidance to prosecutors in Wales and Englandwhich aims to prosecute people who are responsible for sexual harassment in the street. The CPS suggests even incidents such as ""cat-calling"" could be classed as offences under existing public order law. But Welsh Women's Aid said the new guidance doesn't go far enough as its chief executive says she ""struggles to celebrate a commitment to use existing powers better"". ""If we already had this legislation in place, why wasn't it being used already?"" added Sara Kirkpatrick. This video can not be played Archive: The university footballers offering to walk women home and make them feel safe ""We have not seen resounding success with prosecution of serious forms of violence against women and girls like sexual abuse or domestic violence, so how this guidance is put into action for sexual harassment is a really big question. ""It's becoming increasingly common for women to use techniques to keep themselves safe. It's so sad that we are here in 2022 and women are still having to take responsibility to protect themselves from predators. ""We run a course to address violence against women and girls we're seeing more people sign up for those courses... women feeling like they need to protect themselves."" A CPS spokesperson said: ""Women have the right to go out without fear of harm. Our updated legal guidance makes clear that this intimidating behaviour can be a criminal offence. ""We are determined to see more perpetrators brought to justice. Harassment and spiking has no place in our society, and the CPS will not hesitate to prosecute these appalling offences whenever our legal test is met.""

"Ryan Giggs told a police officer he hit his ex in the lip, the court heard Ryan Giggs told a police officer he hit his ex ""in the lip"" and also tried to stop her sister calling 999, a court has heard. The former Manchester United player, who denies all charges, gave evidence on a second day of cross-examination. The jury heard the football star's statement to police where he said: ""I've hit her (Kate) in the lip."" During the call made by her sister Emma he was heard by 999 staff berating his ex for ""causing all of this"". Giggs cries in court and denies headbutting ex I'm a love cheat, but I never hit women - Giggs The former Wales international and manager, 48, denies using controlling and coercive behaviour and assaulting Kate Greville, 38. He also denies causing her actual bodily harm, and common assault of Kate Greville's younger sister, Emma Greville. On Thursday at Manchester Crown Court, he was taken through the prepared statement he gave to the police the morning after the alleged assaults on Kate and Emma Greville in November 2020. Mr Wright said: ""You were seeking to create a narrative that didn't properly or fairly describe what had gone on?"" Mr Giggs said: ""No."" Mr Wright said he wanted to create a story in which he was the one who had been attacked and not them. Mr Giggs denied that. Mr Wright also pointed to part of the statement where Mr Giggs said  he accepted ""my head clashed with hers"". ""You headbutted her, didn't you?"" said Mr Wright. ""No,"" said Mr Giggs. The footballing star also admitted berating his ex's sister, Emma for calling the police ""You had completely lost your self control?"" ""No,"" said Mr Giggs, who also denied headbutting Emma Greville. Mr Wright also asked if Mr Giggs ""berated"" and ""chastised"" Emma Greville for calling the police, which he admitted. Mr Wright referred Mr Giggs to his screaming and shouting in the background of the 999 call Emma Greville made. The call operator heard Mr Giggs telling his ex ""you... caused this"". ""Until the police arrived, you were going to be angry and aggressive?"" he was asked. ""No,"" he said. Giggs' ex screamed in pain on 999 call, court told I was slave to Giggs' demands, ex tells court But he agreed his demeanour changed by the time the police arrived and were speaking to him. He was then referred to how, later, when telling the officer what had happened, he said: ""I've hit her in the lip."" Ryan Giggs has denied being controlling or coercive with his ex-girlfriend ""Why not say it was an accident?"" asked Mr Wright. ""I don't know,"" he replied. Mr Wright said it was because he was saying what had happened. ""You had assaulted her, hadn't you?"" Mr Giggs said: ""No."" Mr Wright asked Mr Giggs why he could be heard saying ""all losers"" during the 999 call made by Emma Greville. Mr Giggs said he ""did not know"" why he would refer to both women as losers. Mr Wright then told him: ""I'm going to suggest it was because you realised what you had done and you were going to be arrested."" Mr Giggs said: ""No."" Mr Wright accused Mr Giggs of preparing to ""get your story straight"" as he waited outside his house for the arrival of police officers. He also alleged the ex-footballer wanted to give the impression he was pleased they were arriving, which he also denied. He reminded Mr Giggs that Emma Greville told police during the 999 call: ""He is screaming and shouting."" Mr Giggs said he ""did not know"" he was screaming and shouting when asked by the prosecution but no-one else was there. The court heard that Giggs told police at the house ""she is going to say I attacked her"" and that Kate Greville's sister Emma ""will obviously be on her side"". He also denied blaming Kate Greville for the dispute and told the police at his house that she had taken his phone, so he was not giving hers back. He denied being ""angry and aggressive to Ms Greville"" and he believed the sisters would tell the police he had headbutted Kate, which he denied. Mr Giggs also admitted he was ""just scared"" about these accusations. Asked what he thought might happen, Mr Giggs replied: ""I'm not too sure, but it just didn't look good."" Asked what he had meant by saying ""we'll be everywhere"", Mr Giggs said: ""The newspapers and the media."" Ryan Giggs told his barrister Chris Daw QC both he and Kate Greville would block each other online in the course of their relationship. He said it was also ""common"" for them to exchange intimate photographs of each other but he had never threatened to share any of Kate Greville with anyone else. They would also exchange love poems, the court heard. In August 2017, she messaged him: ""You make my heart flutter because you are a nutter."" The next day, Mr Giggs wrote: ""I'm not gonna lie, I think of you, I dream of you. Can't help thinking, pulling you was my greatest ever coo [sic]."" Mr Giggs also accepted he would send messages to Kate Greville and her friends when she was looking to break up with him on several occasions during their six-year relationship. When asked whether he was seeking to control Kate Greville he told the court: ""To try to rekindle the relationship."" Mr Daw said: ""What was Kate's reaction?"" Mr Giggs said: ""She was happy that I persisted and I fought for her."" He also said his ""unannounced visits"" to Kate Greville at times when they had broken up was to ""just to try and see her"" and ""rekindle the relationship"" and that Kate was ""just happy that I had fought for us and that I had persisted"". Chris Daw QC asked Ryan Giggs about messages he sent to Kate Greville with ""deeply unpleasant language"" after she told him he would no longer be going on a trip to Scotland with her. He added that he only remembered using that language one time. Mr Giggs replied: ""Because I was upset, I was looking forward to going to the trip. I was on a big high and then a big low."" He also admitted that he had a private and public persona but neither of them involved using violence. The trial continues.

"Peter Coshan was last seen in Edinburgh on 11 August Detectives are treating the disappearance of a former teacher at Edinburgh's Fettes College as murder. Dr Peter Coshan, 75, was last seen in the Seafield Road area of Edinburgh at about 23:50 on 11 August and was reported missing the next day. Two men, aged 27 and 63, have been arrested and charged. Mr Coshan, who taught biology at former prime minister Tony Blair's old school, is presumed dead but his body has not been found. The arrested men are due to appear at Edinburgh Sheriff Court on Thursday. Fettes College said it was ""shocked and deeply saddened"" to hear of the disappearance. Mr Coshan was a member of the teaching staff from 1972 until his retirement in 2005.  He joined a year after Tony Blair attended the school, from 1966 to 1971. Helen Harrison, head of Fettes College, said: ""Peter was an inspirational biology teacher and he will be remembered fondly by many. ""Not least by those who were taught by him, tutored by him and introduced to the hills through his enthusiasm for the Duke of Edinburgh Award Scheme, which he ran for 33 years."" Detectives areappealing to the public for information.,external Det Supt Andrew Patrick said extensive inquiries were ongoing to trace Mr Coshan, whose home in Stockbridge is four miles from where he was last seen.

"Some victims were buried on the outskirts of the city A huge explosion has ripped through a crowded mosque in the Afghan capital Kabul, killing 21 people, police say. Another 33 people were injured, Kabul police spokesman Khalid Zadran added. Wednesday's blast occurred during evening prayers. The mosque's imam Amir Muhammad Kabuli is reported to be among the dead. It is unclear who was behind the attack, a week after Islamic State (IS) militants killed a pro-Taliban cleric in a suicide bomb blast, also in Kabul. The Talibanâs secretive war against IS Security forces have now sealed off the blast scene in Kabul. Witnesses described hearing a powerful explosion which shattered windows in nearby buildings. ""I saw that so many people were killed, even people were thrown out of the windows of the mosque,"" one eyewitness told Reuters news agency. Stefano Sozza, the head of the medical charity Emergency, which runs the city's main hospital, told the BBC his group had already treated 35 people, including children. ""Our doctors... operated [on] the patients in need of surgical assistance all night long. The injuries were mainly related to the blast, so there were shells inside the bodies and burning injuries all over the bodies of the victims."" He said he believed the blast was inside the mosque. ""There was probably someone entering during the prayer time, so it was crowded at that moment and then [the attacker] activated this body burning improvised explosive device. ""So that all the persons that were close to the attacker were basically dead and the ones all around received several injuries,"" Mr Sozza said. News agency AP quoted Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid as saying that the ""perpetrators of such crimes will soon be brought to justice and will be punished"". But in a series of tweets, the UN mission in Afghanistan (Unama) urged the Taliban to take ""concrete steps"" to prevent terrorism and provide additional support to vulnerable communities. It said the attack was ""the latest in a disturbing series of bombings,externalwhich have killed & injured more than 250 people in recent weeks, the highest monthly number of civilian casualties over the last year"". Senior Taliban officials are meeting more than 2,000 tribal and religious elders on Thursday in Afghanistan's second city Kandahar, the movement's main power base. A spokesman quoted by AFP news agency said ""important decisions"" would be taken at the major gathering. The Kabul bombing comes days after theassassination of prominent cleric and Taliban supporter Rahimullah Haqqaniin a suicide bombing. The Islamic State group said it carried out the attack on Mr Haqqani, one of the highest profile figures to be killed since the Taliban returned to power a year ago. The mosque was crowded, the bomb powerful, and another cleric seems to have been in the sights of Islamic State, the group which has emerged as the Taliban's most potent enemy. In the past month, three prominent religious leaders were targeted in Kabul and there were assassinations in other cities. Last week it was Sheikh Rahimullah Haqqani, known to be close to the Taliban. This time it's Amir Muhammad Kabuli, said to be an adherent of the more moderate Sufi faith. Video posted on social media showed a scene of carnage. One religious student who was just outside the mosque told the BBC he saw the bodies of the dead and injured sprawled inside, including children attending evening prayers. IS's signature has been its devastating attacks on the minority Shia Hazara community. But their focus now seems to be widening just as the Taliban celebrate their one year in power - a takeover which ended one chapter of a long bloody war but only ushered in yet another. These Islamist groups have long been split along ideological and religious lines, deepened by intense personal and political rivalries. The Taliban don't share IS's adherence to an austere Salafist creed, its global jihadi ambitions and the most savage of tactics; IS reviles the Taliban for its diplomatic engagement in recent years with the US and other Western powers.

"Top A-level grades have risen for students across England, Wales and Northern Ireland for the first time since 2021. Overall this year 28% of all grades were A* or A - up from 27.2% in 2023. However the figures vary between the three nations, rising in England but falling in Wales and Northern Ireland. Here is what you need to know about everything from grade boundaries to clearing. You can normally pick up AS and A-level results in person anytime from 08:00 BST. However, some students receive their results via email. Check with your school or college about the arrangements in place for you. How much does uni cost and does it boost earnings? Everything you need to know about student loans Surprised by your results? Our interactive guide on what to do next Each exam is graded on a scale from A* to E. Grade boundaries show the minimum number of marks you need for each grade. They are decided by examiners and published on results day. Qualifications Wales, which oversees Welsh exams, had been prepared to use statistics to set the grade boundaries to prevent marks dropping significantly below 2019 levels, because of a concern that performance in some subjects had still not recovered fully since the pandemic. That back-up plan was not needed. In England and Northern Ireland the way boundaries are decided has returned to normal. Ucas is a charity which runs a clearing process,externalmatching students with university and college courses which still have spaces. Students can use it if they: fail to achieve the grades for their conditional offer fail to receive any offers they want to accept decide after 30 June to apply for university achieve better grades than expected and want to change universities Clearing is now open and closes on 21 October. Universities make an offer to a student to join a course based on qualifications and grades or theUcas tariff points system,external. Each A-level grade is worth a certain number of Ucas points. For example, an A* is worth 56 points and a D is worth 24 points. Many students decide not to go to university and start an apprenticeship or go straight into work. Others take agap year,externalso they have more time to decide what to do next. What are apprenticeships and how do I choose a good one? If you do not think your grade is right, you should talk to your school or college. It will contact the exam board on your behalf and ask for your marks to be reviewed. If you still think you have been unfairly graded after a review,you can ask your school or college to appeal,external. The exam board will consider whether a correction is needed. If you are still not satisfied, you can request a review from the exams regulator Ofqual. The charity YoungMinds points out thatexam results are not the only measure of success,external- and if things do not turn out how you had hoped, there are lots of ways to get where you want to. If you only just miss out on the grades you need to get on to a university or college course, the admissions office might accept you anyway or offer you a place on a different course.

"Top grades for A-level results for England, Wales and Northern Ireland have fallen since last year â with 36.4% of all grades marked at A* or A But the percentage is still higher than 2019 â the last time results were based on students taking exams Grades have been purposefully lowered from levels seen in 2020 and 2021 - when students were assessed by teachers due to the pandemic Students have also received their T-level results for the first time ever - the overall pass rate was 92% These technical qualifications are each broadly equivalent to three A-levels, and involve a mix of classroom learning and industry placements More than 425,000 students have got a place in university or college - the second highest number on record - Ucas figures show A return to in-person exams sees 19% more 18-year-olds accepted into their first or insurance choice than in 2019 Edited by Alice Cuddy and Chris Giles It's been a big day for teenagers receiving their results and working out their next steps. Here's a quick look back at what happened:  Today's coverage was brought to you by Vanessa Clarke, George Crafer, Alys Davies, James FitzGerald, Marita Moloney and Nathan Standley. The page was edited by Alice Cuddy and Chris Giles. For those that did not get the
grades they wanted, results day can be tough. âI know right now it probably
feels like the end of the world, but it really isn't,"" says 22-year old
Alexandra Offer. She didn't get into her first
choice university on results day. ""Leeds was my firm [favourite], and they had rejected me. I rang them up and
asked if there was any way I could get in and they said: no sorry,"" she recalls. She went to Cardiff University
instead. ""I've absolutely loved it,
I wouldn't change it for a thing. Everything happens for a reason and obviously
Cardiff was the place for me to go,"" she says. She is now about to finish her
Masters degree and is starting a job as Executive Search Consultant. ""I'm literally a prime
example of [how] you can still be successful and get to where you want to
be."" Nathan StandleyEducation reporter We've been hearing how some BTec and CTec students have had their results delayed - leaving some worried that their university place might be hanging in the balance. But Ucas has sought to reassure those students that their offers will be held to ensure that they have time to get their grades confirmed. Although some might be concerned about clearing places being taken up, the admission service adds that ""the important thing is not to panic"". âStudents
may find they are awaiting their examination results for many reasons, and not
all qualifications are awarded on JCQ results day,"" a spokesman told us. ""Universities are used to
managing this in their processes, and we are working with awarding bodies to
ensure all students can receive a decision on their application. ""Ucas advises that universities hold offers
until 7th September, so any student that has yet to receive their
qualification results has time to meet this. Students are also free to start
their clearing research should they wish,"" he added. Shadow education secretary Bridget Phillipson accuses the Tories of failing young people Labour is warning that some parts of England have witnessed more
of a drop in students getting top grades than others. Nationally, there was a fall of 8.4 percentage points in pupils getting A* or A grades compared to 2021 - when pupils were assessed by their teachers due to the pandemic. Some 36% of A-level entries gained marks in those top categories this year - up from 25.4% in 2019. But the fall was sharper for students in the North East, Yorkshire and Humber, and the East Midlands, than for those in London and the South East, Labour analysis of the data shows. ""These inequalities reveal the Conservativesâ continued failure to enable
all young people to thrive post-pandemic,"" said the party's shadow education secretary, Bridget Phillipson. Education Minister Will Quince told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme that the attainment gap was narrowing year on year, but that more work could be done. Two exam boards - Pearson and OCR - have told us they are working to resolve delays in some BTec and CTec results being returned to students. Students and their families have said they are concerned that without these final grades, their university places can't be confirmed - all as more and more clearing places are taken up by other students. Both exam boards have been responding on social media asking students to contact them privately so they can ""review and advise"" them as quickly as possible. Pearson have also recommended affected students should call them on 0345 618 0440. The number of top A* and A grades awarded in Northern Ireland has fallen from last year. But the proportion of top grades is much higher than in 2019 - the last time when results were based on exams. About 44% of A-level entries have been awarded A* or A grades this year, compared to a record 51% in 2021. In 2019, when exams were last held in person, just over 30% of entries were awarded the top two grades. You can read more about Northern Ireland's results here.  Earlier we told you that English Literature has dropped out of the top 10 most popular A-levels this year. Here are some other key trends reported by the Press Association: This video can not be played A-level results: AQA students âlet downâ by exam board It's been a day of celebrations for thousands of A-level students, but some are feeling âlet downâ after they were given the wrong advance information. In England, students were given additional detail this year due to disruption caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. However,an AQA A-level law exam included topics students were not expecting. A spokesperson for AQA admitted the issues made the exam âmore challengingâ for students, but said grade boundaries for the affected paper were lowered. However, some students at Outwood Post-16 Centre in Workshop, Nottinghamshire, said it made them âlose all composureâ during the exam. Shaun Da CostaNewsbeat Reporter Lana Cardo, 17, is studying a T-level in Health Assistant Adult Nursing at The Manchester College. In her first year of T-levels, which are two-year courses equivalent to three A levels, she got an A*, A and B. âI was really happy when I got them, I wasnât expecting that at all,â she told BBC Newsbeat. Lana described the course as âa really in depth course in terms of theory and practicalâ. We have done placements within a hospital which have been really insightful into the workforce and healthcare sector. And a lot of the theory has been based on legislation and other healthcare which has been really good.â  Lana will be applying to university later this year and said she was hoping to go to Manchester or Salford. The first students to take T-levels have been receiving their results  - 1,029 pupils have completed courses in education and childcare; design, surveying and planning; and digital production. 92% of students achieved a pass or above - and 370, or 71%, of those who applied for a university course have so far been successful. The Institute for Apprenticeships and Technical Education says others have already secured an apprenticeship or a job. You can find out more on this story here: First T-level students receive their results in England Nathan StandleyEducation reporter It's not just Pearson affected by today's delays in BTec results. Exams board OCR has also apologised to students still waiting for their Cambridge Technicals (C-Tec) grades - the OCR equivalents of BTecs. Dad David Callow told us his daughter had received her A-level results - but her university place studying paramedic science won't be confirmed until she gets her C-Tec results in health and social care. ""She's desperately wanted to be a paramedic for years, she's really been throwing herself into it, and now she's sat here with the exam board failing to do the basics,"" he said. ""She's got friends out celebrating, knowing that they're definitely going to university, and she doesn't."" He said they were also worried that more and more clearing courses are being taken up ""by the hour"" as the wait continues. An OCR spokesperson said: âWhile most results were delivered on time, we are sorry for a
delay in issuing Cambridge Technicals for some students."" ""In these exceptional
cases, we are working with schools and colleges to deliver results as soon as
possible and to keep Ucas informed where results are needed for university
offers. We will provide regular updates to those affected,"" they added. Hazel ShearingEducation correspondent As we reported, 58% of private school candidates in England got A* and A grades at A-level, compared with 30.7% of comprehensive school pupils. Fee-paying schools did particularly well last year when teachers' assessments were used for A-level grades. Some 70.4% of private school pupils got the top two grades, compared with just 39.4% of comprehensive schools.  While this year's percentage-point gap is narrower, it's still significant. And it matters because those pupils with top grades will be the ones competing for courses at the most academically selective universities. Not all pupils got the same help when schools closed during lockdowns and they had to learn remotely â which disrupted Year 11 and Year 12 for pupils getting their results today. Some schools were better able to provide laptops to pupils for remote learning. Their pupils may have had more access to computers and to the internet at home, or more physical space in which to learn. It was not the same story for everyone. Lady Louise was pictured at the Commonwealth Games earlier this month A-level results day is an anxious occasion, whoever you are. One of those who got her grades today was the Queen's granddaughter, Lady Louise Windsor. Buckingham Palace didn't reveal what her results were but says she'll now attend the University of St Andrews to study English. It's one of the country's top universities, with standard entry grades set at AAA and minimum entry grades of ABB for the English MA. Lady Louise will follow in the footsteps of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, who met at the university in Fife, Scotland, when Kate was studying history of art and William was reading geography. As we've been reporting, hundreds of thousands of students have been receiving their A-level results today. They all sat their exams this summer for the first time since the coronavirus outbreak. Education Secretary James Cleverly has paid tribute to the ""resilience and hard work"" shown by students who ""experienced unprecedented disruption over the last couple of years"". There were lots of happy faces among this group of students at Norwich School today Genevieve Boateng and her teacher, Sharna-Kay Prehay, share a hug at Harris City Academy in Crystal Palace, London Sarim Rafique smiles with his mum after he receives his A-level results at Ffynone House School in Swansea Atlanta Watson (centre) reacts after opening her A-level results at Lagan College, Belfast Twin sisters Elena and Rosa Launder received identical top results in Somerset, but are heading to different universities Getting your grades can be really tough. If you feel like it's impacting your mental health today, there are plenty of helpful resources you can access. Amid rising levels of anxiety in the run up to results day, Childline said it had seen large numbers of students receiving counselling for concerns about their grades.

Telford College students Jag, Poppy and Kyra with their friend Abi Taras (second from right) Poppy Akiti from Telford College in Shropshire got triple distinctions in their BTecs this morning. They are going to Birmingham City
University to study law with the dream of becoming a civil rights solicitor. ""Family
life and background made me want to take it as a career path,"" Poppy said. ""I have seen
people be treated not nicely, so I'd rather help people who are having this
treatment and hopefully make everyone proud - including my teachers."" Jag Uppal, meanwhile, got a
distinction and two merits - the grades he needed to get into Birmingham
City University to study cyber security. ""I'm pretty over the moon to be
honest,"" he said. ""I was not expecting this at all. I don't know how I've done
this [but] I've managed to pull it out the bag."" If you're wondering how many people got their first choice university place this year, here are some figures from Ucas, the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service:  This shows a reduction in the number of students getting their first choice of university this year compared with last year, but an increase of 1.1 percentage points when compared with 2019 - the last time pupils sat exams. Some students who were expecting their BTec results today are still nervously waiting for their grades after a delay in results coming in. One mum of twin girls in Tameside, Greater Manchester, told the BBC there were a number of missing BTec results at her daughters' college. Qualifications board Pearson confirmed there had been issues, but said the delayed results accounted for only a ""very small percentage"" of the grades being awarded today. But the Tameside mum told the BBC her daughters were ""stressed"" not knowing whether they have their places at Huddersfield University or not. ""They didnât
get to do GCSEs because of Covid, didnât get to have a prom. Now this, itâs a
joke,"" she said. A spokesperson for Pearson said they were aware that ""a very small percentage of BTec students are experiencing a delay in receiving their results"". ""BTecs are a modular qualification and in order for us to award an overall grade, we require unit grades to be provided for each module studied. Where unit information is missing, we are working closely with schools and colleges to resolve this and provide any outstanding results as soon as we can,"" the spokesperson added. Navtej JohalBBC News Midlands correspondent It's the busiest day of the year here at Ucas headquarters
in Cheltenham. The people behind me have been on the phone since about 08:00. Theyâve been dealing with enquiries from loads of students - loads
of people concerned about what to do next. There are 270 staff here dealing with enquiries from roughly 20,000
people. It's the day they trained for, the day they look forward to. One member of staff described it to me earlier as their
Christmas Day. The advice coming from them time and time again is to remain
optimistic, whatever's happened. Remain flexible. There are 27,000 courses available via clearing. If you didnât get the results youâve wanted, or if you've done
better than you expected, there are lots of options there for you. Ellie CleverleyNewsbeat Reporter You've opened the envelope or email containing your A-level, BTec or T-level results and they're not what you expected. Don't panic -there are things you can do next. 1. Double check It's always worth double checking with your university if you can still attend, despite not getting the grades you needed. 2. Clearing If you applied for university but just missed the mark, some universities may still have a place for you thanks to clearing. So, if you still want to go to university, visit the Ucas website to see the universities that have available places. Find a university you like? As soon as you can, phone the admissions contact number for the university which you applied for. Tell them the grades you got and see if they will allow you to enrol as a student. 3. Appealing or re-sitting If clearing doesn't work out and you think your grades are incorrect, you could potentially appeal your exam results and pay to have your papers remarked. This needs to be done as soon as possible so don't wait around! Â© 2025 BBC.

"Some victims were buried on the outskirts of the city A huge explosion has ripped through a crowded mosque in the Afghan capital Kabul, killing 21 people, police say. Another 33 people were injured, Kabul police spokesman Khalid Zadran added. Wednesday's blast occurred during evening prayers. The mosque's imam Amir Muhammad Kabuli is reported to be among the dead. It is unclear who was behind the attack, a week after Islamic State (IS) militants killed a pro-Taliban cleric in a suicide bomb blast, also in Kabul. The Talibanâs secretive war against IS Security forces have now sealed off the blast scene in Kabul. Witnesses described hearing a powerful explosion which shattered windows in nearby buildings. ""I saw that so many people were killed, even people were thrown out of the windows of the mosque,"" one eyewitness told Reuters news agency. Stefano Sozza, the head of the medical charity Emergency, which runs the city's main hospital, told the BBC his group had already treated 35 people, including children. ""Our doctors... operated [on] the patients in need of surgical assistance all night long. The injuries were mainly related to the blast, so there were shells inside the bodies and burning injuries all over the bodies of the victims."" He said he believed the blast was inside the mosque. ""There was probably someone entering during the prayer time, so it was crowded at that moment and then [the attacker] activated this body burning improvised explosive device. ""So that all the persons that were close to the attacker were basically dead and the ones all around received several injuries,"" Mr Sozza said. News agency AP quoted Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid as saying that the ""perpetrators of such crimes will soon be brought to justice and will be punished"". But in a series of tweets, the UN mission in Afghanistan (Unama) urged the Taliban to take ""concrete steps"" to prevent terrorism and provide additional support to vulnerable communities. It said the attack was ""the latest in a disturbing series of bombings,externalwhich have killed & injured more than 250 people in recent weeks, the highest monthly number of civilian casualties over the last year"". Senior Taliban officials are meeting more than 2,000 tribal and religious elders on Thursday in Afghanistan's second city Kandahar, the movement's main power base. A spokesman quoted by AFP news agency said ""important decisions"" would be taken at the major gathering. The Kabul bombing comes days after theassassination of prominent cleric and Taliban supporter Rahimullah Haqqaniin a suicide bombing. The Islamic State group said it carried out the attack on Mr Haqqani, one of the highest profile figures to be killed since the Taliban returned to power a year ago. The mosque was crowded, the bomb powerful, and another cleric seems to have been in the sights of Islamic State, the group which has emerged as the Taliban's most potent enemy. In the past month, three prominent religious leaders were targeted in Kabul and there were assassinations in other cities. Last week it was Sheikh Rahimullah Haqqani, known to be close to the Taliban. This time it's Amir Muhammad Kabuli, said to be an adherent of the more moderate Sufi faith. Video posted on social media showed a scene of carnage. One religious student who was just outside the mosque told the BBC he saw the bodies of the dead and injured sprawled inside, including children attending evening prayers. IS's signature has been its devastating attacks on the minority Shia Hazara community. But their focus now seems to be widening just as the Taliban celebrate their one year in power - a takeover which ended one chapter of a long bloody war but only ushered in yet another. These Islamist groups have long been split along ideological and religious lines, deepened by intense personal and political rivalries. The Taliban don't share IS's adherence to an austere Salafist creed, its global jihadi ambitions and the most savage of tactics; IS reviles the Taliban for its diplomatic engagement in recent years with the US and other Western powers.

"The release at Bexhill beach was caused by a pumping station power failure Beaches in East Sussex have been closed after untreated wastewater was released into the sea at the shoreline. Beaches in Bexhill and Normans Bay were shut after ""significant"" electrical issues at a pumping station. In neighbouring Hastings, the borough council also advised people from swimming at Pelham Beach due to a pollution risk. A Southern Water spokesman said the firm was ""deeply sorry"" and it understood ""the distress this causes"".

Power was restored by the evening, with emergency generators in place. Juliette Wills is a member of the Bexhill SeaGals, a sea-swimming group with about 1,000 members. She said the sewage release will affect her mental and physical health because the swimming sessions were more than just a ""splash around"", and that they also help her while living with a disability. She believes water companies should be ""held accountable"", and added: ""It is unbelievable and outrageous that the water companies can just continue to get away with this."" MPs across Sussex have written to Southern Water and the Environment Agency demanding that Sussex's waterways and coast ""are respected and protected"" in the wake of the latest discharge. ""In addition to the obvious environmental and community impact, the closure of popular beaches and restrictions on inland waterways causes financial loss to the numerous businesses who rely on our beaches and rivers"", they added in the letter, calling for a plan to end discharges. Hugo Tagholm, head of Surfers Against Sewage, said: ""Water companies have flipped from extreme drought to extreme sewage pollution. ""Years of underinvestment is now in plain sight. It's time that huge water company profits were diverted to properly managing water and sewage, and protect people and planet. ""Our rivers and beaches should not be subject to this type of industrial environmental vandalism.""

"Mick Lynch, boss of the RMT union which is leading today's train strike, says action by his union will continue ""until we reach a settlement"" Network Rail's boss says the ongoing dispute over pay, jobs and conditions can be unlocked by putting a proposed deal to union members Today, passengers are being told only to travel by train if necessary - just 20% of services running Some places will have no services, and where they are operating, trains will only run between 07:30 and 18:30 BST Meanwhile, the government says the unions are ""hell-bent on causing misery"" for travellers Strike action is also planned for Saturday, as well as walkouts on the London Underground and London Overground on Friday Edited by Nathan Williams We'll be closing this page shortly. Many thanks for following along
throughout the day. Today's coverage was
brought to you by Nathan Williams, Heather Sharp, George Wright and Oliver
Slow. As we near the end of today's coverage of the train strikes, here's a
recap of the main developments: Katy AustinTransport correspondent The
overall picture is that about 20 percent of usual train services are able to run
today, and they will finish earlier than normal. Some people can now work from home who would normally commute but it's not an
option for everybody, and a lot of leisure plans are being disrupted. So are we any closure to a resolution in these ongoing disputes? Well the tone
of interviews by key players this morning was very much one of frustration, and the
sense that not very much progress has been made towards agreements. Network Rail does want the RMT union to put an offer that it rejected last
month to its members to have their say. But generally union leaders are still saying
they will push for a pay rise that reflects the increased cost of living, and
they say job security and conditions need protecting. Although no national strikes will take place on Friday, travellers could
feel some leftover effects from today, particularly in the morning. Travel in London, however, is set to be highly disrupted, with strikes
affecting much of the underground, overground and bus networks. Transport for
London (TfL) advises against all tube travel, and only on the rest of the
network ""if essential"". ""If you need to travel, river services, London Cable Car and Santander
Cycles will be available to help you get around,"" TfL says. Here's how things are looking in the capital on Friday: Katy AustinTransport correspondent Charley
and Andy have Andy's mum to thank if they make their flight to Turkey from
Gatwick Airport today. She alerted them to the fact today's strike coincided with the start of their
holiday to Bodrum, on the Aegean Sea, which theyâd been planning for two years. They arrived with four boys in tow at Norwich Station 90 minutes before they
originally planned, but they're still among the lucky ones. They originally looked into getting a car down to Gatwick â a distance of about
150 miles (240km) â but that would have cost them an extra Â£300. So they came to
the station several days ago and spoke to staff, who explained that even though
there would be a limited service due to the strike action, it would still be
possible to get to the airport. Standing outside
Liverpool Lime Street station this morning, striking rail workers expressed
sadness about the need to resort to industrial action to try and secure a pay rise. ""We're in a cost of living crisis, and weâre being told to show restraint in
our pay claims, but the people who arenât showing restraint are the energy
companies,"" Gary Kilroy, Merseyside branch general secretary of the Transport
Salaried Staffsâ Association (TSSA), told the BBC. Kilroy continued:  The only people being asked to show restraint are working people, and weâre out here to say thatâs not fair and we need to keep our pay up with the cost of living so we can afford to pay the bills.""  Liverpool Street services were reduced to two departures per hour due to the strikes. Staff from the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers (RMT) were also on the picket line. RMT's Darren Pilling thanked the public for their support, saying there was a ""vacuum"" at the top of the government. He added: It's very sad we're out here again""  With just 20% of
services running, today's strikes are likely to cause widespread disruption for people attending events - here are just a few examples. In London this includes West Hamâs Europa Conference League qualifying tie
against Danish side Viborg FF, which is due to kick off at 19:45 BST at London
Stadium in Stratford. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Emmanuel Moine is the general manager of the Glen Mhor Hotel in Inverness. He told BBC Scotland how hotels across the Highlands have had cancellations as a result of the train strikes. He said: ""We have had some cancellations and the hotel is 60 or 70% full when we should be fully booked. ""We are in August so obviously it has an impact on the tourism."" Moine is also the chairman of the Highland Hotels Association which represents 20 chain and independently-operated hotels. He said other hoteliers have noticed similar downturns in business. ""I've been speaking to every hotelier in Inverness and we have the same problem. ""We had a great tourist season, but we do our best to correct the problem and it's not helping. You can read more about the impact on rail services in Scotlandhere. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has said that the median salary for the rail sector is Â£44,000. But is it? The BBC has looked into this, and it depends who you include. These are the Office of National Statistics' median salary figures for five different categories of workers: The ONS have calculated a median figure of Â£43,747 across these five categories. However, if train drivers are not included - and they have not been involved in the RMT strikes - the ONS figure is Â£36,800. However, the RMT says 10,000 of its members are cleaners, who are lower paid. It says that if you take the Â£44,000 figure, exclude the drivers and include cleaning staff you get a median figure of Â£33,000. As we've been reporting, Transport Minister Grant Shapps has had some strong words for the strikers, saying the unions are ""hell-bent on causing as much misery as possible to the very same taxpayers who stumped up Â£600 per household to ensure not a single rail worker lost their job during the pandemic"". He also wrote in the Daily Mail yesterday, setting out a plan to tackle ""Luddite trade unions"". It included changes to the rules on taking industrial action, such as setting minimum service levels during strikes, and requiring more ballots of union members. This prompted ire from Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner. ""Instead of doing their jobs, Tory ministers are dreaming up reckless anti-union laws that would inflame disputes, risk passenger safety, and weaken employment rights,"" she said. ""Shapps could resolve this strike with a one-point plan: him getting around the table and doing his job."" The government has said it will not bring in major policy initiatives until the new leader is in place in September, but it did pass legislation earlier in the summer to allow businesses to use agency workers to fill in for striking staff.

OnFriday, an RMT strike will affect both the London
Underground and London Overground in separate disputes over pensions and pay. Transport
for London(TfL) says people should avoid the Tube, which will have little or no
services running, and only use the rest of the network if essential. Some bus services will also be affected as drivers take part in a strike
called by the Unite union. TfL has published alist of the routes,externallikely to be
affected. OnSaturday,the RMT and TSSA will go on strike again.
The effect on services is expected to be the same as today, although some
services will run on one of the days but not the other. Disruption is likely to
continue into Sunday morning. Unite's London bus
strike will also continue for a second day. Looking beyond this week, RMT leader Mick Lynch said his union will continue with strikes ""until we reach a settlement"" with Network Rail and other operators. Or need a recap? Here are the latest developments as the UK faces another day of rail strikes: A loans company in Wolverhampton has had to shut for a
day after todayâs rail strike meant staff could not reach the office. Street UK, an alternative
credit provider, will be closed Thursday, says chief executive Julia Herdman.
Itâs the second time railway strikes led to the closure of one of its branches. ""We don't have a lot of staff, so sometimes we
have to make these difficult decisions,"" she tells BBC Radio WM. ""It could potentially mean that someone who is in
need of our help can't get our help."" West Midlands Trains is running a reduced timetable on Thursday and Saturday,
while services are expected to be ""significantly disrupted"" on Friday. With
many workers likely to remain at home today because of the nationwide rail strikes,
internet providers are expecting a boost in usage. Tony Hughes of broadband provider 4th Utility says his firm expects
internet traffic to increase by up to 15 percent today - ""a really significant uplift"". ""We'll see millions more people abandoning their commutes and working from studies,
kitchens and spare bedrooms,"" he said, adding that Covid had ensured companies
were prepared for the increased demand. This video can not be played The people of Plymouth have been giving their opinions on the strikes. More now from RMT leader Mick Lynch. He told Sky News that action
by his union will continue ""until we reach a settlement"" with Network
Rail and other operators. He's also warned that the UK
could be brought by a standstill by a wave of strikes hitting ""every
sector of the economy"". He stopped short of predicting a general strike, saying that it
was down to Trades Union Congress to make that decision. But he added: ""What you are going to get is a wave of
solidarity action, generalised strike action, synchronised action. ""And you'll see it in every sector of the economy, in education,
in health, wider parts of the transport system, in all sectors, the private
sector as well. ""People are fed up with the way they've been treated. The
British worker is basically underpaid and gets no dignity or respect in the
workplace."" The opposition has said the rail strike impasse can
be best resolved by the two sides coming together to reach a fair outcome for
all. Speaking to TalkTV this week, shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said the way to
support striking workers ""doesnât involve going on picket lines"". Instead, she
said Labour should work to ""bring the parties together to get an outcome that
is fair to those people who work in the rail sector and elsewhere"". Keir Starmer, who has attracted criticism from some corners of his party for
his stance on the issue, told ITV ""you canât be in government around the cabinet
table and then go to a picket line"". Last month Starmer removed from his front bench a junior shadow transport
minister, Sam Tarry, who joined striking rail workers on a picket line. At the time, the opposition leader said he wanted to turn
Labour ""from a party of protest into a party that can win power â then hand
that power to working people"". In 2020, almost 40 percent of rail journeys in
England were for commuting, and more than a quarter were for leisure. Although the numbers that year were skewed by Covid, just 4
percent of train trips were for business. 
A year earlier - pre-pandemic - almost half of rail journeys were for
commuting. Katy AustinTransport correspondent I'm at Norwich station today. There are some trains departing but this is a dispute affecting the
whole country and - like a lot of other places - the trains started later than
normal. We spoke to some people who turned up here and forgot the strike was
happening. The reason it's so disruptive on a national scale is that the RMT
workers on strike include some from Network Rail who control the signals. That means even if the train company in your area isn't involved in the
dispute you just canât run the number of trains you would do normally if you
havenât got signalling staff. This dispute feels
fairly intractable at the moment. This video can not be played RMT members should vote on proposed deal - Rail chief We've
had more reaction from Network Rail Chief Executive Andrew Haines. He says his company has put forward a deal amounting to an 8% pay rise over two years, but that it hasn't been put to staff. The RMT have refused to put that to a referendum, and that's the problem because if they had the chance to vote on that, we believe they'd accept it. When we put a similar deal to a different union that got a very strong endorsement.  That's the way to unlock this, thatâs the way to get rid of this huge frustration for passengers today.""  He also defended his large salary in comparison to striking workers. ""People are not going on strike over what I'm earning,"" he said. ""They believe they want a decent pay rise, they want protection, they want job security, and we've offered that."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Today's coverage was brought to you by Alys Davies, Aoife Walsh, George Wright, James FitzGerald, Heather Sharp and Alex Therrien. The leaders of Turkey, Ukraine and the UN held a press conference after talks We'll be bringing our coverage to today's events in Ukraine to a close soon, but first, here's a look back at some key developments. Explosions hit an area near a Russian military airport in the annexed Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea on Thursday, according to Reuters. At least four explosions struck the airport of Belbek, north of Sevastopol, the news agency reported, citing three local sources. Ukraine has not confirmed it was behind the attack and the BBC cannot independently verify the claim. The explosions follow a string of attacks against Russian military sites and equipment in Crimea over the last week, which Ukraine has not claimed responsibility for. After one such attack, Ukraineâs defence minister, Oleksiy Reznikov, suggested careless Russian soldiers could be to blame, warning the country's troops to not âsmoke in dangerous placesâ. Around the time Thursday's attack was reported, Ukraine's defence ministrytweeted,external""smoking kills"" - an apparent reference to Reznikov's apparently tongue-in-cheek remarks. Russia has also not confirmed Thursday's attack. The governor of Sevastopol said Russian anti-aircraft forces downed a Ukrainian drone but said no damage had been done. Russian troops are accused of using the power plant as a military base - but also attacking it UN chief Antonio Guterres has said he is ""gravely concerned"" about the nuclear plant in Zaporizhzhia, which is under Russian control. What's been happening there since the war started? The Ukrainian president (left) says he's agreed the parameters of any inspection of the nuclear plant with the UN chief (right) More from President Zelensky, who's given his nightly video address. There's ""no objective obstacle"" to any visit to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), he says. Both Russia and Ukraine accuse each other of shelling the vast power plant, which is under Russian occupation, risking a nuclear accident. In his video, Zelensky says it would be possible for IAEA representatives to assess the site having safely travelled via Ukrainian-held territory. He earlier said he'd agreed the parameters of a potential visit with UN chief Antonio Guterres. Zelensky says any denial of an IAEA mission by Moscow would mean the Kremlin was ""destroying the international order"". David BrownBBC News Visual Journalism Team New figures suggest that the US is still by far the biggest donor of military aid to Ukraine. The Kiel Institute for the World Economy says Washington committed to spending more than $25bn between 24 January and 1 July. The UK has committed the second largest amount, with Poland and Germany third and fourth in the list. The figures do not take into account amounts committed but not actually spent, so it is possible that they don't give a full picture of what help is reaching Ukraine's armed forces. Separately, the researchers looked at overall aid commitments in July, including financial and humanitarian help to Ukraine. They said that last month:""Donor countries initiated almost no new aid, but they did deliver some of the already committed support such as weapon systems.â An ammunition depot is on fire near the village of Timonovo in the Belgorod region of Russia, near the border with Ukraine, according to the local governor. Writing on Telegram, Vyacheslav Gladkov said there were no casualties, but that residents in nearby areas had been evacuated for their own safety. He added that the cause of the fire is under investigation. The BBC is unable to verify the incident.

Volodymyr Zelensky says he and UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres have agreed the parameters of a possible
mission of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to the
Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant. Following talks with Turkey's
leader and Guterres in Lviv,
Zelensky told a news conference Russia should immediately
withdraw its forces and stop shelling from the nuclear power
plant. He said a possible IAEA visit should be done ""legally via territory free from the occupiers"". Ukraineâs representative to the IAEA told the BBC a team of inspectors must be allowed into the facility as soon as possible. Yevhenii Tsymbaliuk said the best option would be to remove Russian forces and weapons from the site - the largest nuclear complex in Europe - and for Ukrainians to regain full control of the power plant. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has ruled out a peace deal with Russia unless it withdraws its troops from Ukraine. Speaking after talks with Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres in Lviv, Zelensky told reporters he was ""very surprised"" to hear from the Turkish leader that Russia was ""ready for some kind of peace"". He adds: ""First they should leave our territory and then we'll see."" The death toll in Kharkiv, in north-eastern Ukraine, has increased to 17 people after Russian shelling hit a number of residential buildings, according to local governor Oleh Synehubov. As well as the 10 people who had already been pronounced dead, rescuers have now recovered a further seven bodies from the rubble, Synehubov wrote in a message on Telegram. Among the dead was a boy born in 2009, he added. Forty-two people were also injured in the rocket attacks, he said. Attacks also hit the city of Krasnograd in the Kharkiv region - where a couple were killed and their 12-year-old daughter was seriously injured, Mr Synehubov said. Hugo BachegaBBC News, Dnipro The UN and Turkey helped broker the only diplomatic
breakthrough in this war so far - a deal that allowed Ukraine to resume its
exports after a months-long Russian blockade that led to a global food crisis. Antonio Guterres, the UN Secretary General, was personally involved in the
negotiations; Turkey is hosting the centre that co-ordinates the deal,
including with inspections of ships. Itâs a delicate arrangement. After meeting the Ukrainian and Turkish
presidents, Guterres urged all sides to continue working âin good faithâ for
the deal to hold. President
Erdogan of Turkey said the grain deal could form the basis for peace talks
between Ukraine and Russia. But few share the enthusiasm. President Zelensky
said negotiations can only start after Russia leaves territory it invaded. Their
talks in Lviv were overshadowed by the tensions around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear
power plant, hundreds of miles away. They all expressed concern that the
military activity around the station could result in a catastrophe. Thereâs
hope diplomacy can solve this crisis too, although there are no signs of it
yet. Employees of Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant have said they are ""powerless"" in the face of ""human irresponsibility and madness"". They've warned of a potential nuclear catastrophe at the facility, saying in the past two weeks it has become ""the
target of continuous military attacks"". ""Artillery strikes are becoming more and
more powerful and dangerous every time,"" they say. The plant, the largest in Europe, has been occupied by Russian forces since March, though its Ukrainian staff have continued with daily operations. The message from the workers does not name either Russia or Ukraine, which have both blamed each other for shelling near the plant. Some of the facility's 10,000 staff are being injured or killed at work, they add, in theappeal published on the Telegram messaging app,external. ""Stop and think!... What is happening is horrific and beyond common sense and morality,"" they write, warning that an accident could be worse than the nuclear disasters at Chernobyl and Fukushima. ""We know how to professionally manage a nuclear reaction, but are powerless
before human irresponsibility and madness,"" they say. The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant has been occupied by Russian forces since March Ukraine's main intelligence agency has accused Russia of planning to stage a ""provocation"" at the Zaporizhzhia power plant. Moscow wants to ""raise the stakes"", a Telegram post from the agency alleges. It claims that Russia is planning a terrorist attack at the site which will be blamed on Kyiv. The plant, the largest in Europe, has been under Russian control since March. The post says that representatives from the Rosatom, the Russian state nuclear corporation, had suddenly left the site. Earlier, Russia made its own accusation that Kyiv was plotting an incident which it could blame on Moscow. Hugo BachegaBBC News, Kyiv We've been hearing Turkey's President Recep Erodgan and UN chief Antonio Guterres warn about the dangers of the situation at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is accusing Russia of ânuclear blackmailâ over tensions at the complex, Europeâs largest. Officials here claim Russia is creating this crisis to try to force Ukraine and other countries to comply with their conditions. Ukraine says Russia has deployed around 500 forces to the complex, who are using it as a shield to launch attacks against Ukrainian towns. Russia, on the other hand, denies the accusations, and says its troops are, in fact, protecting the plant. For days, Russia and Ukraine have accused each other of shelling near the site, fuelling fears of a nuclear catastrophe. Itâs hard to independently verify the allegations, as the plant is off limits. The facility has been under Russian occupation since early March, although Ukrainian technicians still operate it. Theyâre working under pressure, and there are claimssome have been detained, tortured and beaten. UN chief Antonio Guterres says damage to the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine would be ""suicide"". Speaking to reporters after talks in Lviv, Guterres says he was ""gravely concerned"" about the situation at the plant and said it had to be demilitarised. He says: ""We must tell it like it is - any potential damage to Zaporizhzhia is suicide."" Guterres adds the facility must not be used as part of ""any military
operation"" and that ""agreement is urgently needed to re-establish
Zaporizhzhia's purely civilian infrastructure and to ensure the
safety of the area"". Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has said the world doesn't want ""another Chernobyl"", warning of the possibility of a nuclear accident at Zaporizhzhia if conflict there continues. He's been speaking at a press conference in Lviv, following talks with his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky and UN chief Antonio Guterres. Erdogan says the trio also discussed ways to end the war between Russia and Ukraine. He says they discussed the exchange of prisoners of war
between Ukraine and Russia, and that he would later raise the
issue with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Turkey has recently acted as a mediator between the two countries, including on the issue of unblocking grain exports from Ukraine's ports. Will VernonBBC News, Moscow The Russian defence ministryâs statement earlier today can be summarised in two words: Blame Ukraine. During press briefing at the ministryâs imposing building in central Moscow, Lt-Gen Igor Kirillov, who is head of Russiaâs radioactive, chemical and biological defence forces, gave a presentation in which he accused the Ukrainians of endangering theZaporizhzhia nuclear plant,which Russian forces control. He claimed the plant's back-up support systems had been damaged as a result of Ukrainian shelling, and that Kyiv was planning a provocation â an âindustrial disasterâ â at the power plant on Friday, the same day that UN Secretary General Guterres visits the Ukrainian port city of Odesa. During his presentation, Lt-Gen Kirillov presented a slide that showed how radioactive material would spread over Germany, Poland and Slovakia in the event of an accident at the plant. We see this kind of narrative almost daily in Russia, both in official statements and on state-controlled TV. Moscow says Ukraine is guilty of everything from shelling civilian areas and committing war crimes, to planning nuclear meltdowns. At the same time, it fails to mention that it was Russia that invaded Ukraine and occupied its territory, and it is Russian troops that are accused of committing atrocities. The latest warning is likely more distraction tactics by Moscow. By stressing the risks of a nuclear accident and decrying the alleged âcrimesâ of the Ukrainian government (as Moscow sees it), the authorities can draw the publicâs attention away from the Russian armyâs poor performance on the battlefield. Russian forces have barely seized more than a handful of villages in Ukraine in the last month, whilst casualties are mounting. UN Secretary General
Antonio Guterres has urged Moscow and Kyiv to show a
""spirit of compromise"" and ensure the continued success of the grain deal that enabled the resumption of grain exports from Ukraine. Speaking at a press conference after talks in Lviv with Ukraine and Turkey's leaders, Guterres tells reporters that 21 ships had departed from Ukrainian ports under the
deal in less than a month, and 15 vessels had left Istanbul for
Ukraine to load up with grain and other food supplies. He adds: ""But it is only the beginning. I urge all parties to ensure
continued success. ""From day one, the parties have worked professionally and in
good faith to keep the food flowing. I appeal for this to
continue and for them to overcome all obstacles in a spirit of
compromise and permanently settle all difficulties."" He also reiterated his plea for the demilitarisation of
the nuclear power plant held by Russian forces in Zaporizhzhia, saying he was gravely concerned
by the situation in and around it. Russia has dismissed the proposal, claiming it would make the facility ""more vulnerable"". A Russian foreign ministry spokesperson has said that while a clash with the collective West is possible, a direct nuclear conflict with the US and Nato would not be in Russia's interests. ""Russia has never sabre-rattled weapons, especially nuclear weapons. But the events in Ukraine... clearly show that a clash with the collective West is quite real,"" Ivan Nechayev said, as reported by the Interfax news agency. Moscow is ""committed to the principle that there can be no winners in a nuclear war, and it should never be unleashed"", he said. ""Russia, as a nuclear power, will continue to act as responsibly as possible. A direct clash with the US and Nato is not in our interests. ""Russian military doctrine allows a nuclear response only in response to aggression using weapons of mass destruction, or when the very existence of the state is threatened."" We're hearing more now from the talks between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and UN chief Antonio Guterres. Zelensky says the two leaders discussed grain, after exports from Ukraine resumed this month following a landmark deal brokered by the UN and Turkey. Tonnes of grain had been stuck in Ukraine because of Russian blockades, leading to shortages and higher food prices in other countries. ""We agreed to continue the coordination of the grain initiative implementation. We also discussed the possible directions of its development,"" Zelensky says.

"Train passengers have been facing more disruption, with only 20% of services running on Thursday due to strikes. Half of Britain's lines are closed as more than 45,000 rail workers walk out in a row over pay, jobs and conditions. Some routes have no services, and where they are operating, trains will only run between 07:30 and 18:30 BST. Another strike is scheduled for Saturday. Passengers are being told only to travel by train if necessary. It is the latest in a series of summer strikes and will alter the travel plans for workers, festival-goers and those heading to the cricket Test match at Lord's in London. Mick Lynch, general secretary of the Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union has warned that the dispute could go on ""indefinitely"" unless a pay settlement is reached. In a letter to the transport secretary, he accused the government of using taxpayers' money to ""bail out"" private train companies, helping them to avoid being liable for revenue lost due to strike action. ""The same companies comply with government instructions to hold down pay, cut thousands of safety critical rail jobs, introduce driver-only trains and close ticket offices across the network"", Mr Lynch added. A spokesperson for the Department for Transport said: ""Yet again, for the sixth time since June, union leaders are opting to inflict misery and disrupt the day-to-day lives of millions instead of working with industry to agree a deal that will bring our railways into the 21st century."" When are the train and Tube strikes? How much are rail workers paid? Strikes to disrupt almost all ScotRail services A total of 4,300 services are expected to run across the country on Thursday and Saturday, according to track operator Network Rail. This is the highest number yet during the series of national RMT strikes. However, it is still only just over a fifth of usual service levels. Some places, including Portsmouth, Swansea and Blackpool, will have no trains at all and there will be no services running north of Falkirk. Services will also finish earlier. The last train from London to Edinburgh on Thursday, for example, left at 14:00, while the last train to Leeds left at 15:05. Trains will also start later than usual on the days following strikes. The involvement of Network Rail signal workers across England, Wales and Scotland makes the RMT strike particularly disruptive. RMT general secretary Mick Lynch joined a picket line outside London's Euston station It is not possible to run trains without signallers, and only a fraction can run with the available contingency staffing. Network Rail owns and manages most of the UK's rail infrastructure. If customers are not able to travel on Thursday or Saturday, the Rail Delivery Group - which represents operators - said they can use these tickets either the day before or up to and including 23 August. Otherwise customers will be able to change the ticket or claim a refund. Thursday's strikes involve members of the RMT at 14 train operators, TSSA (Transport Salaried Staffs' Association) members at seven companies and Unite members at Network Rail. Network Rail's chief executive Andrew Haines described negotiations with unions as ""slow"" and ""painful"" and said there was ""an absolute lack of clarity over what it would take for this strike to be called off"". Luke Chester, organising director at the TSSA, said: ""The reality is that what we need to resolve this dispute is a pay rise which reflects the cost of living increase that is affecting most people in this country very severely."" Meanwhile, on Friday both the London Underground and Overground will be affected by RMT strike action, in a separate dispute over pensions and pay. Transport for London said people should avoid the Tube, which will have little or no services running, and only use the rest of the network if essential. It advised bus services may also be affected as drivers take part in a strike called by Unite the union. Today is the start of four days of reduced services in a row, because strike day disruption spills over into later-starting trains the next day. The rail industry says these national scale strikes cost them up to Â£30m a day. And three weeks on from the previous national scale RMT strike, resolutions to the ongoing disputes over pay and conditions don't appear much closer. One cohort of managers who are in the TSSA have come to a pay agreement with Network Rail - but other groups in the union haven't reached deals with their employers. Last month, the RMT rejected Network's Rail's latest pay offer despite their insistence that the union should put it to their members first. Talks since then haven't produced an agreement to prevent these latest walkouts going ahead. When it comes to the train companies, even less progress has been made. Unions have repeatedly accused the government of not enabling effective negotiations, but the transport secretary has insisted only employers and unions can settle their disputes. Lucy Westwood has spent Â£100 extra to book a hotel for a theatre trip Lucy Westwood has spent an extra Â£100 on a hotel and petrol to be able to take her children to the theatre on Thursday. Her original plan had been to get the train from Lichfield to London to see Back to the Future. She had bought theatre tickets for the August ""Kids Week"" where children get cheaper tickets. ""I'd got a day family return - all sorted and planned but then heard about the strikes,"" Lucy said. She was unable get a refund from the theatre and was offered to swap her tickets but could not afford to pay the difference for a more expensive date. ""It's made things a lot more difficult, I was stuck with tickets I couldn't get a refund for and two very disappointed kids,"" she said.

There's ""no objective obstacle"" to any visit to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), he says. Both Russia and Ukraine accuse each other of shelling the vast power plant, which is under Russian occupation, risking a nuclear accident. In his video, Zelensky says it would be possible for IAEA representatives to assess the site having safely travelled via Ukrainian-held territory. He earlier said he'd agreed the parameters of a potential visit with UN chief Antonio Guterres. Zelensky says any denial of an IAEA mission by Moscow would mean the Kremlin was ""destroying the international order"". David BrownBBC News Visual Journalism Team New figures suggest that the US is still by far the biggest donor of military aid to Ukraine. The Kiel Institute for the World Economy says Washington committed to spending more than $25bn between 24 January and 1 July. The UK has committed the second largest amount, with Poland and Germany third and fourth in the list. The figures do not take into account amounts committed but not actually spent, so it is possible that they don't give a full picture of what help is reaching Ukraine's armed forces. Separately, the researchers looked at overall aid commitments in July, including financial and humanitarian help to Ukraine. They said that last month:""Donor countries initiated almost no new aid, but they did deliver some of the already committed support such as weapon systems.â An ammunition depot is on fire near the village of Timonovo in the Belgorod region of Russia, near the border with Ukraine, according to the local governor. Writing on Telegram, Vyacheslav Gladkov said there were no casualties, but that residents in nearby areas had been evacuated for their own safety. He added that the cause of the fire is under investigation. The BBC is unable to verify the incident.

Volodymyr Zelensky says he and UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres have agreed the parameters of a possible
mission of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to the
Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant. Following talks with Turkey's
leader and Guterres in Lviv,
Zelensky told a news conference Russia should immediately
withdraw its forces and stop shelling from the nuclear power
plant. He said a possible IAEA visit should be done ""legally via territory free from the occupiers"". Ukraineâs representative to the IAEA told the BBC a team of inspectors must be allowed into the facility as soon as possible. Yevhenii Tsymbaliuk said the best option would be to remove Russian forces and weapons from the site - the largest nuclear complex in Europe - and for Ukrainians to regain full control of the power plant. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has ruled out a peace deal with Russia unless it withdraws its troops from Ukraine. Speaking after talks with Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres in Lviv, Zelensky told reporters he was ""very surprised"" to hear from the Turkish leader that Russia was ""ready for some kind of peace"". He adds: ""First they should leave our territory and then we'll see."" The death toll in Kharkiv, in north-eastern Ukraine, has increased to 17 people after Russian shelling hit a number of residential buildings, according to local governor Oleh Synehubov. As well as the 10 people who had already been pronounced dead, rescuers have now recovered a further seven bodies from the rubble, Synehubov wrote in a message on Telegram. Among the dead was a boy born in 2009, he added. Forty-two people were also injured in the rocket attacks, he said. Attacks also hit the city of Krasnograd in the Kharkiv region - where a couple were killed and their 12-year-old daughter was seriously injured, Mr Synehubov said. Hugo BachegaBBC News, Dnipro The UN and Turkey helped broker the only diplomatic
breakthrough in this war so far - a deal that allowed Ukraine to resume its
exports after a months-long Russian blockade that led to a global food crisis. Antonio Guterres, the UN Secretary General, was personally involved in the
negotiations; Turkey is hosting the centre that co-ordinates the deal,
including with inspections of ships. Itâs a delicate arrangement. After meeting the Ukrainian and Turkish
presidents, Guterres urged all sides to continue working âin good faithâ for
the deal to hold. President
Erdogan of Turkey said the grain deal could form the basis for peace talks
between Ukraine and Russia. But few share the enthusiasm. President Zelensky
said negotiations can only start after Russia leaves territory it invaded. Their
talks in Lviv were overshadowed by the tensions around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear
power plant, hundreds of miles away. They all expressed concern that the
military activity around the station could result in a catastrophe. Thereâs
hope diplomacy can solve this crisis too, although there are no signs of it
yet. Employees of Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant have said they are ""powerless"" in the face of ""human irresponsibility and madness"". They've warned of a potential nuclear catastrophe at the facility, saying in the past two weeks it has become ""the
target of continuous military attacks"". ""Artillery strikes are becoming more and
more powerful and dangerous every time,"" they say. The plant, the largest in Europe, has been occupied by Russian forces since March, though its Ukrainian staff have continued with daily operations. The message from the workers does not name either Russia or Ukraine, which have both blamed each other for shelling near the plant. Some of the facility's 10,000 staff are being injured or killed at work, they add, in theappeal published on the Telegram messaging app,external. ""Stop and think!... What is happening is horrific and beyond common sense and morality,"" they write, warning that an accident could be worse than the nuclear disasters at Chernobyl and Fukushima. ""We know how to professionally manage a nuclear reaction, but are powerless
before human irresponsibility and madness,"" they say. The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant has been occupied by Russian forces since March Ukraine's main intelligence agency has accused Russia of planning to stage a ""provocation"" at the Zaporizhzhia power plant. Moscow wants to ""raise the stakes"", a Telegram post from the agency alleges. It claims that Russia is planning a terrorist attack at the site which will be blamed on Kyiv. The plant, the largest in Europe, has been under Russian control since March. The post says that representatives from the Rosatom, the Russian state nuclear corporation, had suddenly left the site. Earlier, Russia made its own accusation that Kyiv was plotting an incident which it could blame on Moscow. Hugo BachegaBBC News, Kyiv We've been hearing Turkey's President Recep Erodgan and UN chief Antonio Guterres warn about the dangers of the situation at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is accusing Russia of ânuclear blackmailâ over tensions at the complex, Europeâs largest. Officials here claim Russia is creating this crisis to try to force Ukraine and other countries to comply with their conditions. Ukraine says Russia has deployed around 500 forces to the complex, who are using it as a shield to launch attacks against Ukrainian towns. Russia, on the other hand, denies the accusations, and says its troops are, in fact, protecting the plant. For days, Russia and Ukraine have accused each other of shelling near the site, fuelling fears of a nuclear catastrophe. Itâs hard to independently verify the allegations, as the plant is off limits. The facility has been under Russian occupation since early March, although Ukrainian technicians still operate it. Theyâre working under pressure, and there are claimssome have been detained, tortured and beaten. UN chief Antonio Guterres says damage to the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine would be ""suicide"". Speaking to reporters after talks in Lviv, Guterres says he was ""gravely concerned"" about the situation at the plant and said it had to be demilitarised. He says: ""We must tell it like it is - any potential damage to Zaporizhzhia is suicide."" Guterres adds the facility must not be used as part of ""any military
operation"" and that ""agreement is urgently needed to re-establish
Zaporizhzhia's purely civilian infrastructure and to ensure the
safety of the area"". Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has said the world doesn't want ""another Chernobyl"", warning of the possibility of a nuclear accident at Zaporizhzhia if conflict there continues. He's been speaking at a press conference in Lviv, following talks with his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky and UN chief Antonio Guterres. Erdogan says the trio also discussed ways to end the war between Russia and Ukraine. He says they discussed the exchange of prisoners of war
between Ukraine and Russia, and that he would later raise the
issue with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Turkey has recently acted as a mediator between the two countries, including on the issue of unblocking grain exports from Ukraine's ports. Will VernonBBC News, Moscow The Russian defence ministryâs statement earlier today can be summarised in two words: Blame Ukraine. During press briefing at the ministryâs imposing building in central Moscow, Lt-Gen Igor Kirillov, who is head of Russiaâs radioactive, chemical and biological defence forces, gave a presentation in which he accused the Ukrainians of endangering theZaporizhzhia nuclear plant,which Russian forces control. He claimed the plant's back-up support systems had been damaged as a result of Ukrainian shelling, and that Kyiv was planning a provocation â an âindustrial disasterâ â at the power plant on Friday, the same day that UN Secretary General Guterres visits the Ukrainian port city of Odesa. During his presentation, Lt-Gen Kirillov presented a slide that showed how radioactive material would spread over Germany, Poland and Slovakia in the event of an accident at the plant. We see this kind of narrative almost daily in Russia, both in official statements and on state-controlled TV. Moscow says Ukraine is guilty of everything from shelling civilian areas and committing war crimes, to planning nuclear meltdowns. At the same time, it fails to mention that it was Russia that invaded Ukraine and occupied its territory, and it is Russian troops that are accused of committing atrocities. The latest warning is likely more distraction tactics by Moscow. By stressing the risks of a nuclear accident and decrying the alleged âcrimesâ of the Ukrainian government (as Moscow sees it), the authorities can draw the publicâs attention away from the Russian armyâs poor performance on the battlefield. Russian forces have barely seized more than a handful of villages in Ukraine in the last month, whilst casualties are mounting. UN Secretary General
Antonio Guterres has urged Moscow and Kyiv to show a
""spirit of compromise"" and ensure the continued success of the grain deal that enabled the resumption of grain exports from Ukraine. Speaking at a press conference after talks in Lviv with Ukraine and Turkey's leaders, Guterres tells reporters that 21 ships had departed from Ukrainian ports under the
deal in less than a month, and 15 vessels had left Istanbul for
Ukraine to load up with grain and other food supplies. He adds: ""But it is only the beginning. I urge all parties to ensure
continued success. ""From day one, the parties have worked professionally and in
good faith to keep the food flowing. I appeal for this to
continue and for them to overcome all obstacles in a spirit of
compromise and permanently settle all difficulties."" He also reiterated his plea for the demilitarisation of
the nuclear power plant held by Russian forces in Zaporizhzhia, saying he was gravely concerned
by the situation in and around it. Russia has dismissed the proposal, claiming it would make the facility ""more vulnerable"". A Russian foreign ministry spokesperson has said that while a clash with the collective West is possible, a direct nuclear conflict with the US and Nato would not be in Russia's interests. ""Russia has never sabre-rattled weapons, especially nuclear weapons. But the events in Ukraine... clearly show that a clash with the collective West is quite real,"" Ivan Nechayev said, as reported by the Interfax news agency. Moscow is ""committed to the principle that there can be no winners in a nuclear war, and it should never be unleashed"", he said. ""Russia, as a nuclear power, will continue to act as responsibly as possible. A direct clash with the US and Nato is not in our interests. ""Russian military doctrine allows a nuclear response only in response to aggression using weapons of mass destruction, or when the very existence of the state is threatened."" We're hearing more now from the talks between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and UN chief Antonio Guterres. Zelensky says the two leaders discussed grain, after exports from Ukraine resumed this month following a landmark deal brokered by the UN and Turkey. Tonnes of grain had been stuck in Ukraine because of Russian blockades, leading to shortages and higher food prices in other countries. ""We agreed to continue the coordination of the grain initiative implementation. We also discussed the possible directions of its development,"" Zelensky says.

"Mick Lynch, boss of the RMT union which is leading today's train strike, says action by his union will continue ""until we reach a settlement"" Network Rail's boss says the ongoing dispute over pay, jobs and conditions can be unlocked by putting a proposed deal to union members Today, passengers are being told only to travel by train if necessary - just 20% of services running Some places will have no services, and where they are operating, trains will only run between 07:30 and 18:30 BST Meanwhile, the government says the unions are ""hell-bent on causing misery"" for travellers Strike action is also planned for Saturday, as well as walkouts on the London Underground and London Overground on Friday Edited by Nathan Williams We'll be closing this page shortly. Many thanks for following along
throughout the day. Today's coverage was
brought to you by Nathan Williams, Heather Sharp, George Wright and Oliver
Slow. As we near the end of today's coverage of the train strikes, here's a
recap of the main developments: Katy AustinTransport correspondent The
overall picture is that about 20 percent of usual train services are able to run
today, and they will finish earlier than normal. Some people can now work from home who would normally commute but it's not an
option for everybody, and a lot of leisure plans are being disrupted. So are we any closure to a resolution in these ongoing disputes? Well the tone
of interviews by key players this morning was very much one of frustration, and the
sense that not very much progress has been made towards agreements. Network Rail does want the RMT union to put an offer that it rejected last
month to its members to have their say. But generally union leaders are still saying
they will push for a pay rise that reflects the increased cost of living, and
they say job security and conditions need protecting. Although no national strikes will take place on Friday, travellers could
feel some leftover effects from today, particularly in the morning. Travel in London, however, is set to be highly disrupted, with strikes
affecting much of the underground, overground and bus networks. Transport for
London (TfL) advises against all tube travel, and only on the rest of the
network ""if essential"". ""If you need to travel, river services, London Cable Car and Santander
Cycles will be available to help you get around,"" TfL says. Here's how things are looking in the capital on Friday: Katy AustinTransport correspondent Charley
and Andy have Andy's mum to thank if they make their flight to Turkey from
Gatwick Airport today. She alerted them to the fact today's strike coincided with the start of their
holiday to Bodrum, on the Aegean Sea, which theyâd been planning for two years. They arrived with four boys in tow at Norwich Station 90 minutes before they
originally planned, but they're still among the lucky ones. They originally looked into getting a car down to Gatwick â a distance of about
150 miles (240km) â but that would have cost them an extra Â£300. So they came to
the station several days ago and spoke to staff, who explained that even though
there would be a limited service due to the strike action, it would still be
possible to get to the airport. Standing outside
Liverpool Lime Street station this morning, striking rail workers expressed
sadness about the need to resort to industrial action to try and secure a pay rise. ""We're in a cost of living crisis, and weâre being told to show restraint in
our pay claims, but the people who arenât showing restraint are the energy
companies,"" Gary Kilroy, Merseyside branch general secretary of the Transport
Salaried Staffsâ Association (TSSA), told the BBC. Kilroy continued:  The only people being asked to show restraint are working people, and weâre out here to say thatâs not fair and we need to keep our pay up with the cost of living so we can afford to pay the bills.""  Liverpool Street services were reduced to two departures per hour due to the strikes. Staff from the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers (RMT) were also on the picket line. RMT's Darren Pilling thanked the public for their support, saying there was a ""vacuum"" at the top of the government. He added: It's very sad we're out here again""  With just 20% of
services running, today's strikes are likely to cause widespread disruption for people attending events - here are just a few examples. In London this includes West Hamâs Europa Conference League qualifying tie
against Danish side Viborg FF, which is due to kick off at 19:45 BST at London
Stadium in Stratford. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Emmanuel Moine is the general manager of the Glen Mhor Hotel in Inverness. He told BBC Scotland how hotels across the Highlands have had cancellations as a result of the train strikes. He said: ""We have had some cancellations and the hotel is 60 or 70% full when we should be fully booked. ""We are in August so obviously it has an impact on the tourism."" Moine is also the chairman of the Highland Hotels Association which represents 20 chain and independently-operated hotels. He said other hoteliers have noticed similar downturns in business. ""I've been speaking to every hotelier in Inverness and we have the same problem. ""We had a great tourist season, but we do our best to correct the problem and it's not helping. You can read more about the impact on rail services in Scotlandhere. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has said that the median salary for the rail sector is Â£44,000. But is it? The BBC has looked into this, and it depends who you include. These are the Office of National Statistics' median salary figures for five different categories of workers: The ONS have calculated a median figure of Â£43,747 across these five categories. However, if train drivers are not included - and they have not been involved in the RMT strikes - the ONS figure is Â£36,800. However, the RMT says 10,000 of its members are cleaners, who are lower paid. It says that if you take the Â£44,000 figure, exclude the drivers and include cleaning staff you get a median figure of Â£33,000. As we've been reporting, Transport Minister Grant Shapps has had some strong words for the strikers, saying the unions are ""hell-bent on causing as much misery as possible to the very same taxpayers who stumped up Â£600 per household to ensure not a single rail worker lost their job during the pandemic"". He also wrote in the Daily Mail yesterday, setting out a plan to tackle ""Luddite trade unions"". It included changes to the rules on taking industrial action, such as setting minimum service levels during strikes, and requiring more ballots of union members. This prompted ire from Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner. ""Instead of doing their jobs, Tory ministers are dreaming up reckless anti-union laws that would inflame disputes, risk passenger safety, and weaken employment rights,"" she said. ""Shapps could resolve this strike with a one-point plan: him getting around the table and doing his job."" The government has said it will not bring in major policy initiatives until the new leader is in place in September, but it did pass legislation earlier in the summer to allow businesses to use agency workers to fill in for striking staff.

OnFriday, an RMT strike will affect both the London
Underground and London Overground in separate disputes over pensions and pay. Transport
for London(TfL) says people should avoid the Tube, which will have little or no
services running, and only use the rest of the network if essential. Some bus services will also be affected as drivers take part in a strike
called by the Unite union. TfL has published alist of the routes,externallikely to be
affected. OnSaturday,the RMT and TSSA will go on strike again.
The effect on services is expected to be the same as today, although some
services will run on one of the days but not the other. Disruption is likely to
continue into Sunday morning. Unite's London bus
strike will also continue for a second day. Looking beyond this week, RMT leader Mick Lynch said his union will continue with strikes ""until we reach a settlement"" with Network Rail and other operators. Or need a recap? Here are the latest developments as the UK faces another day of rail strikes: A loans company in Wolverhampton has had to shut for a
day after todayâs rail strike meant staff could not reach the office. Street UK, an alternative
credit provider, will be closed Thursday, says chief executive Julia Herdman.
Itâs the second time railway strikes led to the closure of one of its branches. ""We don't have a lot of staff, so sometimes we
have to make these difficult decisions,"" she tells BBC Radio WM. ""It could potentially mean that someone who is in
need of our help can't get our help."" West Midlands Trains is running a reduced timetable on Thursday and Saturday,
while services are expected to be ""significantly disrupted"" on Friday. With
many workers likely to remain at home today because of the nationwide rail strikes,
internet providers are expecting a boost in usage. Tony Hughes of broadband provider 4th Utility says his firm expects
internet traffic to increase by up to 15 percent today - ""a really significant uplift"". ""We'll see millions more people abandoning their commutes and working from studies,
kitchens and spare bedrooms,"" he said, adding that Covid had ensured companies
were prepared for the increased demand. This video can not be played The people of Plymouth have been giving their opinions on the strikes. More now from RMT leader Mick Lynch. He told Sky News that action
by his union will continue ""until we reach a settlement"" with Network
Rail and other operators. He's also warned that the UK
could be brought by a standstill by a wave of strikes hitting ""every
sector of the economy"". He stopped short of predicting a general strike, saying that it
was down to Trades Union Congress to make that decision. But he added: ""What you are going to get is a wave of
solidarity action, generalised strike action, synchronised action. ""And you'll see it in every sector of the economy, in education,
in health, wider parts of the transport system, in all sectors, the private
sector as well. ""People are fed up with the way they've been treated. The
British worker is basically underpaid and gets no dignity or respect in the
workplace."" The opposition has said the rail strike impasse can
be best resolved by the two sides coming together to reach a fair outcome for
all. Speaking to TalkTV this week, shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said the way to
support striking workers ""doesnât involve going on picket lines"". Instead, she
said Labour should work to ""bring the parties together to get an outcome that
is fair to those people who work in the rail sector and elsewhere"". Keir Starmer, who has attracted criticism from some corners of his party for
his stance on the issue, told ITV ""you canât be in government around the cabinet
table and then go to a picket line"". Last month Starmer removed from his front bench a junior shadow transport
minister, Sam Tarry, who joined striking rail workers on a picket line. At the time, the opposition leader said he wanted to turn
Labour ""from a party of protest into a party that can win power â then hand
that power to working people"". In 2020, almost 40 percent of rail journeys in
England were for commuting, and more than a quarter were for leisure. Although the numbers that year were skewed by Covid, just 4
percent of train trips were for business. 
A year earlier - pre-pandemic - almost half of rail journeys were for
commuting. Katy AustinTransport correspondent I'm at Norwich station today. There are some trains departing but this is a dispute affecting the
whole country and - like a lot of other places - the trains started later than
normal. We spoke to some people who turned up here and forgot the strike was
happening. The reason it's so disruptive on a national scale is that the RMT
workers on strike include some from Network Rail who control the signals. That means even if the train company in your area isn't involved in the
dispute you just canât run the number of trains you would do normally if you
havenât got signalling staff. This dispute feels
fairly intractable at the moment. This video can not be played RMT members should vote on proposed deal - Rail chief We've
had more reaction from Network Rail Chief Executive Andrew Haines. He says his company has put forward a deal amounting to an 8% pay rise over two years, but that it hasn't been put to staff. The RMT have refused to put that to a referendum, and that's the problem because if they had the chance to vote on that, we believe they'd accept it. When we put a similar deal to a different union that got a very strong endorsement.  That's the way to unlock this, thatâs the way to get rid of this huge frustration for passengers today.""  He also defended his large salary in comparison to striking workers. ""People are not going on strike over what I'm earning,"" he said. ""They believe they want a decent pay rise, they want protection, they want job security, and we've offered that."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Today's coverage was brought to you by Alys Davies, Aoife Walsh, George Wright, James FitzGerald, Heather Sharp and Alex Therrien. The leaders of Turkey, Ukraine and the UN held a press conference after talks We'll be bringing our coverage to today's events in Ukraine to a close soon, but first, here's a look back at some key developments. Explosions hit an area near a Russian military airport in the annexed Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea on Thursday, according to Reuters. At least four explosions struck the airport of Belbek, north of Sevastopol, the news agency reported, citing three local sources. Ukraine has not confirmed it was behind the attack and the BBC cannot independently verify the claim. The explosions follow a string of attacks against Russian military sites and equipment in Crimea over the last week, which Ukraine has not claimed responsibility for. After one such attack, Ukraineâs defence minister, Oleksiy Reznikov, suggested careless Russian soldiers could be to blame, warning the country's troops to not âsmoke in dangerous placesâ. Around the time Thursday's attack was reported, Ukraine's defence ministrytweeted,external""smoking kills"" - an apparent reference to Reznikov's apparently tongue-in-cheek remarks. Russia has also not confirmed Thursday's attack. The governor of Sevastopol said Russian anti-aircraft forces downed a Ukrainian drone but said no damage had been done. Russian troops are accused of using the power plant as a military base - but also attacking it UN chief Antonio Guterres has said he is ""gravely concerned"" about the nuclear plant in Zaporizhzhia, which is under Russian control.

David BrownBBC News Visual Journalism Team New figures suggest that the US is still by far the biggest donor of military aid to Ukraine. The Kiel Institute for the World Economy says Washington committed to spending more than $25bn between 24 January and 1 July. The UK has committed the second largest amount, with Poland and Germany third and fourth in the list. The figures do not take into account amounts committed but not actually spent, so it is possible that they don't give a full picture of what help is reaching Ukraine's armed forces. Separately, the researchers looked at overall aid commitments in July, including financial and humanitarian help to Ukraine. They said that last month:""Donor countries initiated almost no new aid, but they did deliver some of the already committed support such as weapon systems.â An ammunition depot is on fire near the village of Timonovo in the Belgorod region of Russia, near the border with Ukraine, according to the local governor.

Ukraineâs representative to the IAEA told the BBC a team of inspectors must be allowed into the facility as soon as possible. Yevhenii Tsymbaliuk said the best option would be to remove Russian forces and weapons from the site - the largest nuclear complex in Europe - and for Ukrainians to regain full control of the power plant. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has ruled out a peace deal with Russia unless it withdraws its troops from Ukraine. Speaking after talks with Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres in Lviv, Zelensky told reporters he was ""very surprised"" to hear from the Turkish leader that Russia was ""ready for some kind of peace"". He adds: ""First they should leave our territory and then we'll see."" The death toll in Kharkiv, in north-eastern Ukraine, has increased to 17 people after Russian shelling hit a number of residential buildings, according to local governor Oleh Synehubov. As well as the 10 people who had already been pronounced dead, rescuers have now recovered a further seven bodies from the rubble, Synehubov wrote in a message on Telegram. Among the dead was a boy born in 2009, he added. Forty-two people were also injured in the rocket attacks, he said. Attacks also hit the city of Krasnograd in the Kharkiv region - where a couple were killed and their 12-year-old daughter was seriously injured, Mr Synehubov said. Hugo BachegaBBC News, Dnipro The UN and Turkey helped broker the only diplomatic
breakthrough in this war so far - a deal that allowed Ukraine to resume its
exports after a months-long Russian blockade that led to a global food crisis. Antonio Guterres, the UN Secretary General, was personally involved in the
negotiations; Turkey is hosting the centre that co-ordinates the deal,
including with inspections of ships. Itâs a delicate arrangement. After meeting the Ukrainian and Turkish
presidents, Guterres urged all sides to continue working âin good faithâ for
the deal to hold. President
Erdogan of Turkey said the grain deal could form the basis for peace talks
between Ukraine and Russia. But few share the enthusiasm. President Zelensky
said negotiations can only start after Russia leaves territory it invaded. Their
talks in Lviv were overshadowed by the tensions around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear
power plant, hundreds of miles away. They all expressed concern that the
military activity around the station could result in a catastrophe. Thereâs
hope diplomacy can solve this crisis too, although there are no signs of it
yet. Employees of Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant have said they are ""powerless"" in the face of ""human irresponsibility and madness"". They've warned of a potential nuclear catastrophe at the facility, saying in the past two weeks it has become ""the
target of continuous military attacks"". ""Artillery strikes are becoming more and
more powerful and dangerous every time,"" they say. The plant, the largest in Europe, has been occupied by Russian forces since March, though its Ukrainian staff have continued with daily operations. The message from the workers does not name either Russia or Ukraine, which have both blamed each other for shelling near the plant. Some of the facility's 10,000 staff are being injured or killed at work, they add, in theappeal published on the Telegram messaging app,external. ""Stop and think!... What is happening is horrific and beyond common sense and morality,"" they write, warning that an accident could be worse than the nuclear disasters at Chernobyl and Fukushima. ""We know how to professionally manage a nuclear reaction, but are powerless
before human irresponsibility and madness,"" they say. The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant has been occupied by Russian forces since March Ukraine's main intelligence agency has accused Russia of planning to stage a ""provocation"" at the Zaporizhzhia power plant. Moscow wants to ""raise the stakes"", a Telegram post from the agency alleges. It claims that Russia is planning a terrorist attack at the site which will be blamed on Kyiv. The plant, the largest in Europe, has been under Russian control since March. The post says that representatives from the Rosatom, the Russian state nuclear corporation, had suddenly left the site. Earlier, Russia made its own accusation that Kyiv was plotting an incident which it could blame on Moscow. Hugo BachegaBBC News, Kyiv We've been hearing Turkey's President Recep Erodgan and UN chief Antonio Guterres warn about the dangers of the situation at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is accusing Russia of ânuclear blackmailâ over tensions at the complex, Europeâs largest. Officials here claim Russia is creating this crisis to try to force Ukraine and other countries to comply with their conditions. Ukraine says Russia has deployed around 500 forces to the complex, who are using it as a shield to launch attacks against Ukrainian towns. Russia, on the other hand, denies the accusations, and says its troops are, in fact, protecting the plant. For days, Russia and Ukraine have accused each other of shelling near the site, fuelling fears of a nuclear catastrophe. Itâs hard to independently verify the allegations, as the plant is off limits. The facility has been under Russian occupation since early March, although Ukrainian technicians still operate it. Theyâre working under pressure, and there are claimssome have been detained, tortured and beaten. UN chief Antonio Guterres says damage to the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine would be ""suicide"". Speaking to reporters after talks in Lviv, Guterres says he was ""gravely concerned"" about the situation at the plant and said it had to be demilitarised. He says: ""We must tell it like it is - any potential damage to Zaporizhzhia is suicide."" Guterres adds the facility must not be used as part of ""any military
operation"" and that ""agreement is urgently needed to re-establish
Zaporizhzhia's purely civilian infrastructure and to ensure the
safety of the area"". Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has said the world doesn't want ""another Chernobyl"", warning of the possibility of a nuclear accident at Zaporizhzhia if conflict there continues. He's been speaking at a press conference in Lviv, following talks with his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky and UN chief Antonio Guterres. Erdogan says the trio also discussed ways to end the war between Russia and Ukraine. He says they discussed the exchange of prisoners of war
between Ukraine and Russia, and that he would later raise the
issue with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Turkey has recently acted as a mediator between the two countries, including on the issue of unblocking grain exports from Ukraine's ports. Will VernonBBC News, Moscow The Russian defence ministryâs statement earlier today can be summarised in two words: Blame Ukraine. During press briefing at the ministryâs imposing building in central Moscow, Lt-Gen Igor Kirillov, who is head of Russiaâs radioactive, chemical and biological defence forces, gave a presentation in which he accused the Ukrainians of endangering theZaporizhzhia nuclear plant,which Russian forces control. He claimed the plant's back-up support systems had been damaged as a result of Ukrainian shelling, and that Kyiv was planning a provocation â an âindustrial disasterâ â at the power plant on Friday, the same day that UN Secretary General Guterres visits the Ukrainian port city of Odesa. During his presentation, Lt-Gen Kirillov presented a slide that showed how radioactive material would spread over Germany, Poland and Slovakia in the event of an accident at the plant. We see this kind of narrative almost daily in Russia, both in official statements and on state-controlled TV. Moscow says Ukraine is guilty of everything from shelling civilian areas and committing war crimes, to planning nuclear meltdowns. At the same time, it fails to mention that it was Russia that invaded Ukraine and occupied its territory, and it is Russian troops that are accused of committing atrocities. The latest warning is likely more distraction tactics by Moscow. By stressing the risks of a nuclear accident and decrying the alleged âcrimesâ of the Ukrainian government (as Moscow sees it), the authorities can draw the publicâs attention away from the Russian armyâs poor performance on the battlefield. Russian forces have barely seized more than a handful of villages in Ukraine in the last month, whilst casualties are mounting. UN Secretary General
Antonio Guterres has urged Moscow and Kyiv to show a
""spirit of compromise"" and ensure the continued success of the grain deal that enabled the resumption of grain exports from Ukraine. Speaking at a press conference after talks in Lviv with Ukraine and Turkey's leaders, Guterres tells reporters that 21 ships had departed from Ukrainian ports under the
deal in less than a month, and 15 vessels had left Istanbul for
Ukraine to load up with grain and other food supplies. He adds: ""But it is only the beginning. I urge all parties to ensure
continued success. ""From day one, the parties have worked professionally and in
good faith to keep the food flowing. I appeal for this to
continue and for them to overcome all obstacles in a spirit of
compromise and permanently settle all difficulties."" He also reiterated his plea for the demilitarisation of
the nuclear power plant held by Russian forces in Zaporizhzhia, saying he was gravely concerned
by the situation in and around it. Russia has dismissed the proposal, claiming it would make the facility ""more vulnerable"". A Russian foreign ministry spokesperson has said that while a clash with the collective West is possible, a direct nuclear conflict with the US and Nato would not be in Russia's interests. ""Russia has never sabre-rattled weapons, especially nuclear weapons. But the events in Ukraine... clearly show that a clash with the collective West is quite real,"" Ivan Nechayev said, as reported by the Interfax news agency. Moscow is ""committed to the principle that there can be no winners in a nuclear war, and it should never be unleashed"", he said. ""Russia, as a nuclear power, will continue to act as responsibly as possible. A direct clash with the US and Nato is not in our interests. ""Russian military doctrine allows a nuclear response only in response to aggression using weapons of mass destruction, or when the very existence of the state is threatened."" We're hearing more now from the talks between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and UN chief Antonio Guterres. Zelensky says the two leaders discussed grain, after exports from Ukraine resumed this month following a landmark deal brokered by the UN and Turkey. Tonnes of grain had been stuck in Ukraine because of Russian blockades, leading to shortages and higher food prices in other countries. ""We agreed to continue the coordination of the grain initiative implementation. We also discussed the possible directions of its development,"" Zelensky says.

"Mick Lynch, boss of the RMT union which is leading today's train strike, says action by his union will continue ""until we reach a settlement"" Network Rail's boss says the ongoing dispute over pay, jobs and conditions can be unlocked by putting a proposed deal to union members Today, passengers are being told only to travel by train if necessary - just 20% of services running Some places will have no services, and where they are operating, trains will only run between 07:30 and 18:30 BST Meanwhile, the government says the unions are ""hell-bent on causing misery"" for travellers Strike action is also planned for Saturday, as well as walkouts on the London Underground and London Overground on Friday Edited by Nathan Williams We'll be closing this page shortly. Many thanks for following along
throughout the day. Today's coverage was
brought to you by Nathan Williams, Heather Sharp, George Wright and Oliver
Slow. As we near the end of today's coverage of the train strikes, here's a
recap of the main developments: Katy AustinTransport correspondent The
overall picture is that about 20 percent of usual train services are able to run
today, and they will finish earlier than normal. Some people can now work from home who would normally commute but it's not an
option for everybody, and a lot of leisure plans are being disrupted. So are we any closure to a resolution in these ongoing disputes? Well the tone
of interviews by key players this morning was very much one of frustration, and the
sense that not very much progress has been made towards agreements. Network Rail does want the RMT union to put an offer that it rejected last
month to its members to have their say. But generally union leaders are still saying
they will push for a pay rise that reflects the increased cost of living, and
they say job security and conditions need protecting. Although no national strikes will take place on Friday, travellers could
feel some leftover effects from today, particularly in the morning. Travel in London, however, is set to be highly disrupted, with strikes
affecting much of the underground, overground and bus networks. Transport for
London (TfL) advises against all tube travel, and only on the rest of the
network ""if essential"". ""If you need to travel, river services, London Cable Car and Santander
Cycles will be available to help you get around,"" TfL says. Here's how things are looking in the capital on Friday: Katy AustinTransport correspondent Charley
and Andy have Andy's mum to thank if they make their flight to Turkey from
Gatwick Airport today. She alerted them to the fact today's strike coincided with the start of their
holiday to Bodrum, on the Aegean Sea, which theyâd been planning for two years. They arrived with four boys in tow at Norwich Station 90 minutes before they
originally planned, but they're still among the lucky ones. They originally looked into getting a car down to Gatwick â a distance of about
150 miles (240km) â but that would have cost them an extra Â£300. So they came to
the station several days ago and spoke to staff, who explained that even though
there would be a limited service due to the strike action, it would still be
possible to get to the airport. Standing outside
Liverpool Lime Street station this morning, striking rail workers expressed
sadness about the need to resort to industrial action to try and secure a pay rise. ""We're in a cost of living crisis, and weâre being told to show restraint in
our pay claims, but the people who arenât showing restraint are the energy
companies,"" Gary Kilroy, Merseyside branch general secretary of the Transport
Salaried Staffsâ Association (TSSA), told the BBC. Kilroy continued:  The only people being asked to show restraint are working people, and weâre out here to say thatâs not fair and we need to keep our pay up with the cost of living so we can afford to pay the bills.""  Liverpool Street services were reduced to two departures per hour due to the strikes. Staff from the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers (RMT) were also on the picket line. RMT's Darren Pilling thanked the public for their support, saying there was a ""vacuum"" at the top of the government. He added: It's very sad we're out here again""  With just 20% of
services running, today's strikes are likely to cause widespread disruption for people attending events - here are just a few examples. In London this includes West Hamâs Europa Conference League qualifying tie
against Danish side Viborg FF, which is due to kick off at 19:45 BST at London
Stadium in Stratford. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Emmanuel Moine is the general manager of the Glen Mhor Hotel in Inverness. He told BBC Scotland how hotels across the Highlands have had cancellations as a result of the train strikes. He said: ""We have had some cancellations and the hotel is 60 or 70% full when we should be fully booked. ""We are in August so obviously it has an impact on the tourism."" Moine is also the chairman of the Highland Hotels Association which represents 20 chain and independently-operated hotels. He said other hoteliers have noticed similar downturns in business. ""I've been speaking to every hotelier in Inverness and we have the same problem. ""We had a great tourist season, but we do our best to correct the problem and it's not helping. You can read more about the impact on rail services in Scotlandhere. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has said that the median salary for the rail sector is Â£44,000. But is it? The BBC has looked into this, and it depends who you include. These are the Office of National Statistics' median salary figures for five different categories of workers: The ONS have calculated a median figure of Â£43,747 across these five categories. However, if train drivers are not included - and they have not been involved in the RMT strikes - the ONS figure is Â£36,800. However, the RMT says 10,000 of its members are cleaners, who are lower paid. It says that if you take the Â£44,000 figure, exclude the drivers and include cleaning staff you get a median figure of Â£33,000. As we've been reporting, Transport Minister Grant Shapps has had some strong words for the strikers, saying the unions are ""hell-bent on causing as much misery as possible to the very same taxpayers who stumped up Â£600 per household to ensure not a single rail worker lost their job during the pandemic"". He also wrote in the Daily Mail yesterday, setting out a plan to tackle ""Luddite trade unions"". It included changes to the rules on taking industrial action, such as setting minimum service levels during strikes, and requiring more ballots of union members. This prompted ire from Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner. ""Instead of doing their jobs, Tory ministers are dreaming up reckless anti-union laws that would inflame disputes, risk passenger safety, and weaken employment rights,"" she said. ""Shapps could resolve this strike with a one-point plan: him getting around the table and doing his job."" The government has said it will not bring in major policy initiatives until the new leader is in place in September, but it did pass legislation earlier in the summer to allow businesses to use agency workers to fill in for striking staff.

OnFriday, an RMT strike will affect both the London
Underground and London Overground in separate disputes over pensions and pay. Transport
for London(TfL) says people should avoid the Tube, which will have little or no
services running, and only use the rest of the network if essential. Some bus services will also be affected as drivers take part in a strike
called by the Unite union. TfL has published alist of the routes,externallikely to be
affected. OnSaturday,the RMT and TSSA will go on strike again.
The effect on services is expected to be the same as today, although some
services will run on one of the days but not the other. Disruption is likely to
continue into Sunday morning. Unite's London bus
strike will also continue for a second day. Looking beyond this week, RMT leader Mick Lynch said his union will continue with strikes ""until we reach a settlement"" with Network Rail and other operators. Or need a recap? Here are the latest developments as the UK faces another day of rail strikes: A loans company in Wolverhampton has had to shut for a
day after todayâs rail strike meant staff could not reach the office. Street UK, an alternative
credit provider, will be closed Thursday, says chief executive Julia Herdman.
Itâs the second time railway strikes led to the closure of one of its branches. ""We don't have a lot of staff, so sometimes we
have to make these difficult decisions,"" she tells BBC Radio WM. ""It could potentially mean that someone who is in
need of our help can't get our help."" West Midlands Trains is running a reduced timetable on Thursday and Saturday,
while services are expected to be ""significantly disrupted"" on Friday. With
many workers likely to remain at home today because of the nationwide rail strikes,
internet providers are expecting a boost in usage. Tony Hughes of broadband provider 4th Utility says his firm expects
internet traffic to increase by up to 15 percent today - ""a really significant uplift"". ""We'll see millions more people abandoning their commutes and working from studies,
kitchens and spare bedrooms,"" he said, adding that Covid had ensured companies
were prepared for the increased demand. This video can not be played The people of Plymouth have been giving their opinions on the strikes. More now from RMT leader Mick Lynch. He told Sky News that action
by his union will continue ""until we reach a settlement"" with Network
Rail and other operators. He's also warned that the UK
could be brought by a standstill by a wave of strikes hitting ""every
sector of the economy"". He stopped short of predicting a general strike, saying that it
was down to Trades Union Congress to make that decision. But he added: ""What you are going to get is a wave of
solidarity action, generalised strike action, synchronised action. ""And you'll see it in every sector of the economy, in education,
in health, wider parts of the transport system, in all sectors, the private
sector as well. ""People are fed up with the way they've been treated. The
British worker is basically underpaid and gets no dignity or respect in the
workplace."" The opposition has said the rail strike impasse can
be best resolved by the two sides coming together to reach a fair outcome for
all. Speaking to TalkTV this week, shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said the way to
support striking workers ""doesnât involve going on picket lines"". Instead, she
said Labour should work to ""bring the parties together to get an outcome that
is fair to those people who work in the rail sector and elsewhere"". Keir Starmer, who has attracted criticism from some corners of his party for
his stance on the issue, told ITV ""you canât be in government around the cabinet
table and then go to a picket line"". Last month Starmer removed from his front bench a junior shadow transport
minister, Sam Tarry, who joined striking rail workers on a picket line. At the time, the opposition leader said he wanted to turn
Labour ""from a party of protest into a party that can win power â then hand
that power to working people"". In 2020, almost 40 percent of rail journeys in
England were for commuting, and more than a quarter were for leisure. Although the numbers that year were skewed by Covid, just 4
percent of train trips were for business. 
A year earlier - pre-pandemic - almost half of rail journeys were for
commuting. Katy AustinTransport correspondent I'm at Norwich station today. There are some trains departing but this is a dispute affecting the
whole country and - like a lot of other places - the trains started later than
normal. We spoke to some people who turned up here and forgot the strike was
happening. The reason it's so disruptive on a national scale is that the RMT
workers on strike include some from Network Rail who control the signals. That means even if the train company in your area isn't involved in the
dispute you just canât run the number of trains you would do normally if you
havenât got signalling staff. This dispute feels
fairly intractable at the moment. This video can not be played RMT members should vote on proposed deal - Rail chief We've
had more reaction from Network Rail Chief Executive Andrew Haines. He says his company has put forward a deal amounting to an 8% pay rise over two years, but that it hasn't been put to staff. The RMT have refused to put that to a referendum, and that's the problem because if they had the chance to vote on that, we believe they'd accept it. When we put a similar deal to a different union that got a very strong endorsement.  That's the way to unlock this, thatâs the way to get rid of this huge frustration for passengers today.""  He also defended his large salary in comparison to striking workers. ""People are not going on strike over what I'm earning,"" he said. ""They believe they want a decent pay rise, they want protection, they want job security, and we've offered that."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"""You don't expect your trauma to only really begin once you're in the care system,"" says Michela ââââThree children's homes have closed and two more rated ""inadequate"" following a BBC investigation into a firm making huge profits. The homes, previously rated as good or outstanding, were re-inspected after the BBC found children had reported being groomed and assaulted. We can also reveal the company failed to fully report some serious incidents. Calcot Services for Children does not accept the BBC's allegations and says profits were not excessive. Followingthe BBC's investigation in June, Ofsted re-inspected seven of the company's homes in southern England. We have now learned the regulator for England has rated five homes ""inadequate"" - and three of those have now closed. At one, ""serious and widespread failures"" were found with staff not providing some one-to-one care which local councils had paid for, echoing our previous findings. Our continuing investigation has spoken to more than 20 current and former Calcot employees - and has seen new leaked documents and emails. The BBC can now reveal: A former resident has spoken out for the first time, describing how she wasgroomed by a carer A former member of staff claims a manager""covered up""a serious sexual assault allegation involving two children Calcotfailed to reporttwo alleged incidents involving children to a local authority safeguarding manager Fivewhistleblowers- all Calcot staff - contacted Ofsted with concerns more than a year ago Calcot has used a business structure which is legal, but not subject to the samefinancial scrutinyas limited companies Calcot does not accept the BBC's allegations but says an independent review will address issues raised by our investigation and Ofsted. It says it disputes the BBC's characterisation of its profits and says they could not be compared with other companies which are structured differently. Names have been changed to protect identities of former residents and staff. Michela was groomed aged 17 by a man originally employed as the company's marketing manager but then redeployed to a home where older teenagers are given more independence - known as supported living. Speaking out for the first time, she says she wasn't moved from the residence for months after reporting the abuse - and stopped washing and eating because she didn't want to leave her room. ""The only safe place I had in that building was the bedroom, as it was the one place nothing had happened in,"" she says, now aged 19 and waiving her right to absolute anonymity. ""I've never had a man that's shown so much interest in me,"" says Michela Michela's grooming began when Tatenda Shoniwa started following her on social media and messaging her about her life - sometimes until the early hours of the morning. ""I wasn't used to that. I've never had a man that's shown so much interest in me, never had a parent figure,"" she says. Shoniwa is now in prison for abusing his position and sexual activity with a child. Michela says she feels ""completely betrayed"" by some of the other Calcot staff members, who she believes were aware of what he was doing but did not report anything. ""Coming into care you're coming away from trauma"", she says. ""You don't expect for your trauma to only really begin once you're in the system."" The BBC has also now learned that Ofsted discovered that staff at multiple homes did not have adequate training. At one, now closed, inspectors said almost no-one had been trained to handle ligatures or cases of child sexual exploitation - despite it housing children with documented risks of both. In addition, we now know that five managers have left Calcot in the past 18 months after developing concerns about how the company was being run. We had alreadyheard from whistleblowerswho told us they believed the company was putting profit before childcare - and inadequately staffing some homes. Another teenager, Tara - who has learning difficulties and is autistic - was supposed to have two support staff to help, but she says she was often left alone. She frequently asked her local authority social workers if she could move elsewhere, she says. Tara says she was often left unsupervised Calcot then decided to move her, despite staff concerns, into one of its supported living placements where she would have more independence rather than full-time care. The 17-year-old, who lived there with an adult in their early twenties, says she was able to regularly go missing without staff noticing. ""The staff didn't really do anything because it's an adult placement. They do their own thing - on their phones 24/7,"" she says. ""I felt like they weren't looking after me."" Calcot says it follows appropriate referral processes so children are not placed in unsuitable homes. Management also failed to correctly report allegations of child-on-child sexual abuse, the BBC can reveal. We previously reported that two children had been found in May 2021 undressed and without supervision. They both later alleged they had been sexually assaulted. A former support worker, Mia, told us management assured her the incident had been reported to authorities - but Ofsted told the BBC it hadn't. Now, another ex-staff member says she and a manager discussed the children's allegations, but in a later email, seen by the BBC, the manager provided draft wording for a report to social workers which only said that they had been ""found together in each other's rooms"" - with no reference to the sexual assault allegations. Do you have more information about this story? You can reach Noel directly and securely through encrypted messaging app Signal on: +44 7809 334720 or by email at noel.titheradge@bbc.co.uk The former employee says she knew it was wrong to exclude the allegations from her report and believed she had been left ""powerless"" when asked to do so. She says it was ""completely immoral"" not to fully report the children's claims. Former support worker Mia describes what happened as a ""cover-up"". ""[The manager] didn't have the welfare of the children as a priority,"" she says. Calcot says it did report the incident to Ofsted and the relevant local authority designated officer - known as a ""LADO"" - who is responsible for safeguarding. But we know this only happened after our initial investigation - more than a year after the incident. Two other incidents in Calcot homes in the past year also weren't immediately reported to a local authority designated officer - even though they are expected to do so. One involved a boy who alleged he had been punched by a male member of staff while being restrained. It is understood the child later denied the assault took place - but nevertheless a LADO should have been told. Calcot says this decision not to report the alleged assault was taken by the home manager, not a senior manager. The other incident involved another boy who said their arm had been trapped in a car window by a staff member. While not reported to a local authority designated officer, Calcot says it was reported to Ofsted and the boy's social worker - and that the company always makes the relevant reports as required. If you have been affected by any of these issues in this story you can visitBBC Action Line. The BBC has now learned that five Calcot whistleblowers contacted Ofsted about their concerns before we began our investigation. When we published our initial findings in June, all the homes were rated good or outstanding. Ofsted says it does not investigate whistleblowing complaints specifically but says action against Calcot was already under way when the BBC report was released. Last week, Ofsted's chief inspector, Amanda Spielman, said the law needed to change to give more powers to inspect providers of children's homes - which, she said, were inferior to those for adult care homes. Already, in light of the BBC's June report, the Children's Commissioner for England, Dame Rachel de Souza,has called for ""radical reform"". Calcot's profit margin in 2021 was 36% - more than twice the level termed excessive by a government watchdog Calcot has used a business structure called a partnership, the BBC has found, where accounts are subject to less stringent reporting obligations than a limited company. Ofsted says while it is aware of providers across England operating as partnerships, it does not know the total number. Three local authorities have told us they were asked by Calcot to direct payments into a bank account which is used for its partnership. The BBC understands that money was paid back into the firm's limited company account - which recorded huge profits last year. Calcot's profit margin in 2021 was 36% - more than twice the level termed excessive by a government watchdog. Calcot told us the use of the partnership accounts was an ""administrative error on the part of the local authorities"". It added that a number of factors, including built-up investment, made its profits across homes and schools appear bigger than they really were. The owners of Calcot, Sukhbir and Harvinder Singh, declined to be interviewed. In June, the company said it prioritised safeguarding all children in its care and its homes were all staffed correctly. Its lawyers say the BBC has a distorted view of the company and its sources have an axe to grind. They add that Calcot's whistleblowing policy allows concerns to be raised anonymously, so they can be quickly addressed. The Department for Education declined to be interviewed. It said it was investing in raising standards and increasing the number of children's home placements.

"Mick Lynch, boss of the RMT union which is leading today's train strike, says action by his union will continue ""until we reach a settlement"" Network Rail's boss says the ongoing dispute over pay, jobs and conditions can be unlocked by putting a proposed deal to union members Today, passengers are being told only to travel by train if necessary - just 20% of services running Some places will have no services, and where they are operating, trains will only run between 07:30 and 18:30 BST Meanwhile, the government says the unions are ""hell-bent on causing misery"" for travellers Strike action is also planned for Saturday, as well as walkouts on the London Underground and London Overground on Friday Edited by Nathan Williams We'll be closing this page shortly. Many thanks for following along
throughout the day. Today's coverage was
brought to you by Nathan Williams, Heather Sharp, George Wright and Oliver
Slow. As we near the end of today's coverage of the train strikes, here's a
recap of the main developments: Katy AustinTransport correspondent The
overall picture is that about 20 percent of usual train services are able to run
today, and they will finish earlier than normal. Some people can now work from home who would normally commute but it's not an
option for everybody, and a lot of leisure plans are being disrupted. So are we any closure to a resolution in these ongoing disputes? Well the tone
of interviews by key players this morning was very much one of frustration, and the
sense that not very much progress has been made towards agreements. Network Rail does want the RMT union to put an offer that it rejected last
month to its members to have their say. But generally union leaders are still saying
they will push for a pay rise that reflects the increased cost of living, and
they say job security and conditions need protecting. Although no national strikes will take place on Friday, travellers could
feel some leftover effects from today, particularly in the morning. Travel in London, however, is set to be highly disrupted, with strikes
affecting much of the underground, overground and bus networks. Transport for
London (TfL) advises against all tube travel, and only on the rest of the
network ""if essential"". ""If you need to travel, river services, London Cable Car and Santander
Cycles will be available to help you get around,"" TfL says. Here's how things are looking in the capital on Friday: Katy AustinTransport correspondent Charley
and Andy have Andy's mum to thank if they make their flight to Turkey from
Gatwick Airport today. She alerted them to the fact today's strike coincided with the start of their
holiday to Bodrum, on the Aegean Sea, which theyâd been planning for two years. They arrived with four boys in tow at Norwich Station 90 minutes before they
originally planned, but they're still among the lucky ones. They originally looked into getting a car down to Gatwick â a distance of about
150 miles (240km) â but that would have cost them an extra Â£300. So they came to
the station several days ago and spoke to staff, who explained that even though
there would be a limited service due to the strike action, it would still be
possible to get to the airport. Standing outside
Liverpool Lime Street station this morning, striking rail workers expressed
sadness about the need to resort to industrial action to try and secure a pay rise. ""We're in a cost of living crisis, and weâre being told to show restraint in
our pay claims, but the people who arenât showing restraint are the energy
companies,"" Gary Kilroy, Merseyside branch general secretary of the Transport
Salaried Staffsâ Association (TSSA), told the BBC. Kilroy continued:  The only people being asked to show restraint are working people, and weâre out here to say thatâs not fair and we need to keep our pay up with the cost of living so we can afford to pay the bills.""  Liverpool Street services were reduced to two departures per hour due to the strikes. Staff from the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers (RMT) were also on the picket line. RMT's Darren Pilling thanked the public for their support, saying there was a ""vacuum"" at the top of the government. He added: It's very sad we're out here again""  With just 20% of
services running, today's strikes are likely to cause widespread disruption for people attending events - here are just a few examples. In London this includes West Hamâs Europa Conference League qualifying tie
against Danish side Viborg FF, which is due to kick off at 19:45 BST at London
Stadium in Stratford. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Emmanuel Moine is the general manager of the Glen Mhor Hotel in Inverness. He told BBC Scotland how hotels across the Highlands have had cancellations as a result of the train strikes. He said: ""We have had some cancellations and the hotel is 60 or 70% full when we should be fully booked. ""We are in August so obviously it has an impact on the tourism."" Moine is also the chairman of the Highland Hotels Association which represents 20 chain and independently-operated hotels. He said other hoteliers have noticed similar downturns in business. ""I've been speaking to every hotelier in Inverness and we have the same problem. ""We had a great tourist season, but we do our best to correct the problem and it's not helping. You can read more about the impact on rail services in Scotlandhere. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has said that the median salary for the rail sector is Â£44,000. But is it? The BBC has looked into this, and it depends who you include. These are the Office of National Statistics' median salary figures for five different categories of workers: The ONS have calculated a median figure of Â£43,747 across these five categories. However, if train drivers are not included - and they have not been involved in the RMT strikes - the ONS figure is Â£36,800. However, the RMT says 10,000 of its members are cleaners, who are lower paid. It says that if you take the Â£44,000 figure, exclude the drivers and include cleaning staff you get a median figure of Â£33,000. As we've been reporting, Transport Minister Grant Shapps has had some strong words for the strikers, saying the unions are ""hell-bent on causing as much misery as possible to the very same taxpayers who stumped up Â£600 per household to ensure not a single rail worker lost their job during the pandemic"". He also wrote in the Daily Mail yesterday, setting out a plan to tackle ""Luddite trade unions"". It included changes to the rules on taking industrial action, such as setting minimum service levels during strikes, and requiring more ballots of union members. This prompted ire from Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner. ""Instead of doing their jobs, Tory ministers are dreaming up reckless anti-union laws that would inflame disputes, risk passenger safety, and weaken employment rights,"" she said. ""Shapps could resolve this strike with a one-point plan: him getting around the table and doing his job."" The government has said it will not bring in major policy initiatives until the new leader is in place in September, but it did pass legislation earlier in the summer to allow businesses to use agency workers to fill in for striking staff.

OnFriday, an RMT strike will affect both the London
Underground and London Overground in separate disputes over pensions and pay. Transport
for London(TfL) says people should avoid the Tube, which will have little or no
services running, and only use the rest of the network if essential. Some bus services will also be affected as drivers take part in a strike
called by the Unite union. TfL has published alist of the routes,externallikely to be
affected. OnSaturday,the RMT and TSSA will go on strike again.
The effect on services is expected to be the same as today, although some
services will run on one of the days but not the other. Disruption is likely to
continue into Sunday morning. Unite's London bus
strike will also continue for a second day. Looking beyond this week, RMT leader Mick Lynch said his union will continue with strikes ""until we reach a settlement"" with Network Rail and other operators. Or need a recap? Here are the latest developments as the UK faces another day of rail strikes: A loans company in Wolverhampton has had to shut for a
day after todayâs rail strike meant staff could not reach the office. Street UK, an alternative
credit provider, will be closed Thursday, says chief executive Julia Herdman.
Itâs the second time railway strikes led to the closure of one of its branches. ""We don't have a lot of staff, so sometimes we
have to make these difficult decisions,"" she tells BBC Radio WM. ""It could potentially mean that someone who is in
need of our help can't get our help."" West Midlands Trains is running a reduced timetable on Thursday and Saturday,
while services are expected to be ""significantly disrupted"" on Friday. With
many workers likely to remain at home today because of the nationwide rail strikes,
internet providers are expecting a boost in usage. Tony Hughes of broadband provider 4th Utility says his firm expects
internet traffic to increase by up to 15 percent today - ""a really significant uplift"". ""We'll see millions more people abandoning their commutes and working from studies,
kitchens and spare bedrooms,"" he said, adding that Covid had ensured companies
were prepared for the increased demand. This video can not be played The people of Plymouth have been giving their opinions on the strikes. More now from RMT leader Mick Lynch. He told Sky News that action
by his union will continue ""until we reach a settlement"" with Network
Rail and other operators. He's also warned that the UK
could be brought by a standstill by a wave of strikes hitting ""every
sector of the economy"". He stopped short of predicting a general strike, saying that it
was down to Trades Union Congress to make that decision. But he added: ""What you are going to get is a wave of
solidarity action, generalised strike action, synchronised action. ""And you'll see it in every sector of the economy, in education,
in health, wider parts of the transport system, in all sectors, the private
sector as well. ""People are fed up with the way they've been treated. The
British worker is basically underpaid and gets no dignity or respect in the
workplace."" The opposition has said the rail strike impasse can
be best resolved by the two sides coming together to reach a fair outcome for
all. Speaking to TalkTV this week, shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said the way to
support striking workers ""doesnât involve going on picket lines"". Instead, she
said Labour should work to ""bring the parties together to get an outcome that
is fair to those people who work in the rail sector and elsewhere"". Keir Starmer, who has attracted criticism from some corners of his party for
his stance on the issue, told ITV ""you canât be in government around the cabinet
table and then go to a picket line"". Last month Starmer removed from his front bench a junior shadow transport
minister, Sam Tarry, who joined striking rail workers on a picket line. At the time, the opposition leader said he wanted to turn
Labour ""from a party of protest into a party that can win power â then hand
that power to working people"". In 2020, almost 40 percent of rail journeys in
England were for commuting, and more than a quarter were for leisure. Although the numbers that year were skewed by Covid, just 4
percent of train trips were for business. 
A year earlier - pre-pandemic - almost half of rail journeys were for
commuting. Katy AustinTransport correspondent I'm at Norwich station today. There are some trains departing but this is a dispute affecting the
whole country and - like a lot of other places - the trains started later than
normal. We spoke to some people who turned up here and forgot the strike was
happening. The reason it's so disruptive on a national scale is that the RMT
workers on strike include some from Network Rail who control the signals. That means even if the train company in your area isn't involved in the
dispute you just canât run the number of trains you would do normally if you
havenât got signalling staff. This dispute feels
fairly intractable at the moment. This video can not be played RMT members should vote on proposed deal - Rail chief We've
had more reaction from Network Rail Chief Executive Andrew Haines. He says his company has put forward a deal amounting to an 8% pay rise over two years, but that it hasn't been put to staff. The RMT have refused to put that to a referendum, and that's the problem because if they had the chance to vote on that, we believe they'd accept it. When we put a similar deal to a different union that got a very strong endorsement.  That's the way to unlock this, thatâs the way to get rid of this huge frustration for passengers today.""  He also defended his large salary in comparison to striking workers. ""People are not going on strike over what I'm earning,"" he said. ""They believe they want a decent pay rise, they want protection, they want job security, and we've offered that."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"This video can not be played The idea was the brainchild of Swansea student Sophie Morgan. Student Sophie Morgan was terrified when she looked through her curtains to see a man photographing her. ""I opened the curtains and saw a man on my roof outside, filming me and staring right at me,"" recalled Sophie. That chilling moment was Sophie's catalyst to start a group that helps women who have been a victim of sexual harassment. Her group also helps women get home safely at night without feeling frightened. Sophie had heard of incidents of women being sexually harassed in Swansea. The university student thought little was being done to help women's safety, so she decided to act. The issue of women's safety was brought into sharp focus across the UK following the murders ofSarah EverardandSabina Nessain 2021. Women across the country took to social media to discuss their experiences of walking the streets and the lengths they took to feel safe. Sarah Everard had been walking to her home in the Brixton area of London when she disappeared Storiesof being followed, harassed, catcalled, assaulted and exposed toresonated with women in Sophie's group who had gone through similar ordeals. Latest figures suggesta third of UK women had experienced at least one form of harassment,externalin the last year. Primary school teacher Sabina Nessa was attacked as she walked to meet a friend in Kidbrooke, south-east London ""I was living in my student house... hearing a lot of incidents of women being sexually harassed in the street,"" remembered Sophie, talking about her own experience. How a woman's death sparked UK soul-searching Does following the 'rules' keep women safe? How many attacks on women are there? ""I was hearing of women being followed, groped, flashed and worse. ""One night in the winter, I was lying in bed and there was a noise outside my room so I opened the curtains and there was a man with his phone on the roof outside my window taking pictures. ""As soon as I opened the curtains, he jumped down and drove off. I panicked and phoned the police. Sophie Morgan and Ileana Mathias feel the authorities should do more to help protect women ""It was scary. The only confidence I did have was I was living in a student house with eight of us there - and that made it a little bit more reassuring but even when I reported it to the police, we had no success in finding who it was."" The childhood studies graduate was living in the Brynmill area of Swansea at the time of the incident. Sophie soon heard other women's testimonies of being harassed, so set up the social media group to share experiences and warn others. Sophie lived in the Brynmill area, between Swansea's city centre, seafront and the huge Singleton Park ""We were scared, confused, but thought it was time to do something about it,"" said the 24-year-old. Sophie's group now has about 1,000 members. They look out for each other - and if one of them is walking home alone at night, someone will either go out and meet them or talk on the phone until they're safely home. Sophie and Ileana have been the victim of sexual harassment in the last few years She has also helped organise women's safety protests in Swansea and has support from her local MP who has raised the group's concerns in Parliament. The Home Office also granted theSouth Wales Police Commissioner more than Â£180,000,externalthrough itsSafety of Women at Night Fund,external, to ""address issues"" of women's safety in Swansea and develop a sexual harassment campaign to change the attitude and behaviour of men. Sophie has since moved to Swansea's suburbs where she feels safer but still continues her safety campaign. ""It's become this community of women sharing their experiences in a safe space,"" added Sophie, originally from Newport. ""We warn one another if something has happened to them and generally support each other. Sophie Morgan helped organise women's safety protests in Swansea ""If someone is walking on their own and feels unsafe then they can send a message and hopefully someone will be free to go and meet them, or talk to them on the phone or just listen to them."" Swansea has alsoseen a recent rise in alleged drink spiking. One bartender, who is part of Sophie's group, said she had seen instances of drink spiking herself: ""The second alcohol gets involved, it seems to bring the worst out in people."" Ileana Mathias, 24, said she often talks to members of Sophie's group on her walk home from her job in the city's popular Wind Street. ""I find it incredibly heart-breaking that groups like this are necessary. We should be able to walk home without being scared about what could happen to us. Campaigners want improved lightning in Swansea's large Singleton Park to make it feel safer for women ""It's deeply concerning and unfortunate that we have to put these things in place because the people that are supposed to protect us don't really do that much protecting - and don't take things that seriously."" Sophie has worked with Swansea University, the local council and South Wales Police on trying to improve women's safety in the city but says women in her group tell her they ""don't feel confident going to the police, they think nothing happens"". Campaigners have called for more police patrols, a greater police presence in the city centre and improved lightning in the large Singleton Park near the centre of Swansea as Sophie says it's ""not comfortable"" walking through there in the dark.

Sophie said her local MP has joined their protests and urged women to keep highlighting issues so he could raise them in the House of Commons. ""I heard some really awful stuff,"" said Geraint Davies, Labour MP for Swansea West. ""The common theme was these girls didn't feel they could turn to the police to report what was happening.

"This video can not be played The idea was the brainchild of Swansea student Sophie Morgan. Student Sophie Morgan was terrified when she looked through her curtains to see a man photographing her. ""I opened the curtains and saw a man on my roof outside, filming me and staring right at me,"" recalled Sophie. That chilling moment was Sophie's catalyst to start a group that helps women who have been a victim of sexual harassment. Her group also helps women get home safely at night without feeling frightened. Sophie had heard of incidents of women being sexually harassed in Swansea. The university student thought little was being done to help women's safety, so she decided to act. The issue of women's safety was brought into sharp focus across the UK following the murders ofSarah EverardandSabina Nessain 2021. Women across the country took to social media to discuss their experiences of walking the streets and the lengths they took to feel safe. Sarah Everard had been walking to her home in the Brixton area of London when she disappeared Storiesof being followed, harassed, catcalled, assaulted and exposed toresonated with women in Sophie's group who had gone through similar ordeals. Latest figures suggesta third of UK women had experienced at least one form of harassment,externalin the last year. Primary school teacher Sabina Nessa was attacked as she walked to meet a friend in Kidbrooke, south-east London ""I was living in my student house... hearing a lot of incidents of women being sexually harassed in the street,"" remembered Sophie, talking about her own experience. How a woman's death sparked UK soul-searching Does following the 'rules' keep women safe? How many attacks on women are there? ""I was hearing of women being followed, groped, flashed and worse. ""One night in the winter, I was lying in bed and there was a noise outside my room so I opened the curtains and there was a man with his phone on the roof outside my window taking pictures. ""As soon as I opened the curtains, he jumped down and drove off. I panicked and phoned the police. Sophie Morgan and Ileana Mathias feel the authorities should do more to help protect women ""It was scary. The only confidence I did have was I was living in a student house with eight of us there - and that made it a little bit more reassuring but even when I reported it to the police, we had no success in finding who it was."" The childhood studies graduate was living in the Brynmill area of Swansea at the time of the incident. Sophie soon heard other women's testimonies of being harassed, so set up the social media group to share experiences and warn others. Sophie lived in the Brynmill area, between Swansea's city centre, seafront and the huge Singleton Park ""We were scared, confused, but thought it was time to do something about it,"" said the 24-year-old. Sophie's group now has about 1,000 members. They look out for each other - and if one of them is walking home alone at night, someone will either go out and meet them or talk on the phone until they're safely home. Sophie and Ileana have been the victim of sexual harassment in the last few years She has also helped organise women's safety protests in Swansea and has support from her local MP who has raised the group's concerns in Parliament. The Home Office also granted theSouth Wales Police Commissioner more than Â£180,000,externalthrough itsSafety of Women at Night Fund,external, to ""address issues"" of women's safety in Swansea and develop a sexual harassment campaign to change the attitude and behaviour of men. Sophie has since moved to Swansea's suburbs where she feels safer but still continues her safety campaign. ""It's become this community of women sharing their experiences in a safe space,"" added Sophie, originally from Newport. ""We warn one another if something has happened to them and generally support each other. Sophie Morgan helped organise women's safety protests in Swansea ""If someone is walking on their own and feels unsafe then they can send a message and hopefully someone will be free to go and meet them, or talk to them on the phone or just listen to them."" Swansea has alsoseen a recent rise in alleged drink spiking. One bartender, who is part of Sophie's group, said she had seen instances of drink spiking herself: ""The second alcohol gets involved, it seems to bring the worst out in people."" Ileana Mathias, 24, said she often talks to members of Sophie's group on her walk home from her job in the city's popular Wind Street. ""I find it incredibly heart-breaking that groups like this are necessary. We should be able to walk home without being scared about what could happen to us. Campaigners want improved lightning in Swansea's large Singleton Park to make it feel safer for women ""It's deeply concerning and unfortunate that we have to put these things in place because the people that are supposed to protect us don't really do that much protecting - and don't take things that seriously."" Sophie has worked with Swansea University, the local council and South Wales Police on trying to improve women's safety in the city but says women in her group tell her they ""don't feel confident going to the police, they think nothing happens"". Campaigners have called for more police patrols, a greater police presence in the city centre and improved lightning in the large Singleton Park near the centre of Swansea as Sophie says it's ""not comfortable"" walking through there in the dark. This video can not be played Watch: Can this app help to keep women safe on the streets? Sophie said her local MP has joined their protests and urged women to keep highlighting issues so he could raise them in the House of Commons. ""I heard some really awful stuff,"" said Geraint Davies, Labour MP for Swansea West. ""The common theme was these girls didn't feel they could turn to the police to report what was happening. ""The police need better training and need to believe these women when they come forward with their experiences, and don't just tell them 'oh you're drunk' and dismiss their claims. 'All I wanted was to stand with other women' Male allies needed, says women's safety campaign LISTEN: How can women feel safer? ""It's an endemic problem. There needs to be more female police officers and change of culture at the top to stamp this kind of behaviour and these incidents out of our society."" South Wales Police said tackling violence and abuse against women and girls was a ""long-standing priority"" and their Assistant Chief Constable Jenny Gilmer said the force ""recognise that concern regarding personal safety and violence is as great as it has ever been"". Detectives said all reports to police were ""extensively investigated with officers looking at CCTV, as well as speaking to victims and potential witnesses, and looking into medical evidence"". ""Every weekend we have a robust and proactive policing plan in place to protect vulnerable people, identify potential offenders and support victims, as well as providing a visible and reassuring presence in Swansea city centre,"" added local chief inspector Mark Brier. Home Office money have been granted to help ""address issues"" of women's safety in Swansea He said a project runs in the city centre on busy nights to ""provide reassurance and medical assistance to victims"" and ""improves responses to incidents of drink spiking, sexual harassment, and assault"". The Crown Prosecution Service issuednew guidance to prosecutors in Wales and Englandwhich aims to prosecute people who are responsible for sexual harassment in the street. The CPS suggests even incidents such as ""cat-calling"" could be classed as offences under existing public order law. But Welsh Women's Aid said the new guidance doesn't go far enough as its chief executive says she ""struggles to celebrate a commitment to use existing powers better"". ""If we already had this legislation in place, why wasn't it being used already?"" added Sara Kirkpatrick. This video can not be played Archive: The university footballers offering to walk women home and make them feel safe ""We have not seen resounding success with prosecution of serious forms of violence against women and girls like sexual abuse or domestic violence, so how this guidance is put into action for sexual harassment is a really big question. ""It's becoming increasingly common for women to use techniques to keep themselves safe. It's so sad that we are here in 2022 and women are still having to take responsibility to protect themselves from predators. ""We run a course to address violence against women and girls we're seeing more people sign up for those courses... women feeling like they need to protect themselves."" A CPS spokesperson said: ""Women have the right to go out without fear of harm. Our updated legal guidance makes clear that this intimidating behaviour can be a criminal offence. ""We are determined to see more perpetrators brought to justice. Harassment and spiking has no place in our society, and the CPS will not hesitate to prosecute these appalling offences whenever our legal test is met.""

"Japan's young adults are a sober bunch - something authorities are hoping to change with a new campaign. The younger generation drinks less alcohol than their parents - a move that has hit taxes from beverages like sake (rice wine). So the national tax agency has stepped in with a national competition to come up with ideas to reverse the trend. The ""Sake Viva!"" campaign hopes to come up with a plan to make drinking more attractive - and boost the industry. The contest asks 20 to 39-year-olds to share their business ideas to kick-start demand among their peers - whether it's for Japanese sake, shochu, whisky, beer or wine. The group running the competition for the tax authority says new habits - partly formed during the Covid pandemic - and an ageing population have led to a decline in alcohol sales. It wants contestants to come up with promotions, branding, and even cutting-edge plans involving artificial intelligence. Japanese media say the reaction has been mixed, with some criticism about the bid to promote an unhealthy habit. But others have posted quirky ideas online - such as famous actresses ""performing"" as virtual-reality hostesses in digital clubs. Contestants have until the end of September to put forward their ideas. The best plans will then be developed with help from experts before the final proposals are presented in November. Thecampaign's website,externalsays Japan's alcohol market is shrinking and the country's older demographic - alongside declining birth rates - is a significant factor behind it. Recent figures from the tax agency show that people were drinking less in 2020 than in 1995, with numbers plummeting from an annual average of 100 litres (22 gallons) to 75 litres (16 gallons) per adult. Tax revenue from taxes on alcohol has also shrunk over the years. According to The Japan Times newspaper, it made up 5% of total revenue in 1980, but in 2020 amounts to just 1.7%. The World Bank estimates that nearly a third (29%) of Japan's population is aged 65 and older - the highest proportion in the world. Concerns about the future of sake is not the only problem that poses for Japan's economy - there are worries about thesupply of younger staff for certain types of jobs, andcare for the elderlyin the future.

"Ukrainian emergency rescuers attend an exercise in case of a possible nuclear incident at Zaporizhzhia's nuclear plant. It is relatively unusual in Ukraine for a government official to invite you on a short-notice trip. It turns out it is more common for that invitation to come with very little detail. The main reason for that is security - it is not exactly wise to publicise when a minister is going to be somewhere, especially when you are being invaded by another country. We decided to accept, and soon found ourselves at an airfield near Kyiv, where we and other journalists were led onto a helicopter. By this point we knew our destination was the city of Zaporizhzhia, and the subject was the growing danger from the region's nuclear power plant further south. Within 30 seconds of the journey starting, I realised why we were offered anti-nausea tablets before taking off. To stay undetected, the pilot keeps the helicopter around 10 metres off the ground, occasionally hurdling over electric powerlines. There are endless fields of sunflowers. Some are in full bloom, some are wilting, past their best. Regardless, the harvest is fast approaching. Then there is the dense woodland - thousands upon thousands of towering trees which come so close to touching the skids of the chopper. You are left under no illusion of Ukraine's vast and rich landscape. After landing in Zaporizhzhia, you are struck by two things: the more industrial skyline in comparison to Kyiv, as well as the humidity. We end up at a supermarket car park where emergency workers are dressed in yellow hazmat suits. They are practising cleaning drills in the event of a radioactive contamination. Ukraine's last nuclear crisis was the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear incident, when a Soviet-era reactor exploded. They are watched by senior officials, who are keen to see how ready the region would be in the event of a worst-case scenario. ""Of course we are concerned,"" Ukraine's Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko tells me. ""The situation changed dramatically when the Russians started shelling the area on 5 August."" Ukraine says the situation at the plant is ""approaching critical"". Russian forces have occupied the site, Europe's biggest, since early March. They have been urged to hand control back because of the dangers, and some staff there have told the BBC they're ""being kept at gunpoint"". For the past two weeks there's been heavy shelling on and around the plant, with the sides blaming each other. Nato is the latest international organisation to call for United Nations inspectors to be let into the Zaporizhzhia power plant, claiming its seizure posed a serious threat to Ukraine and neighbouring countries. Ukraine nuclear workers: We're kept at gunpoint Real risk of nuclear disaster in Ukraine - watchdog Officials say the plant could be cut off from power as Moscow tries to redirect electricity to Crimea, which it annexed eight years ago. ""It is impossible to ensure the safety of the nuclear power plant while the Russian occupying forces are there,"" says Denys Monastyrskyy, Ukraine's interior minister. ""It is the key concern that we all should understand,"" he adds. Ukraineâs Interior Minister Denys Monastyrskyy says the situation at the plant is âapproaching criticalâ The car park is also a place where Ukrainians who manage to make it out of Russian-occupied territories first arrive. There are queues of cars with people and full suitcases. Sitting in the shade we meet Olena, who has just made it out of the city of Enerhodar, where the nuclear plant is located. ""It's scary, very scary, there is shelling all the time,"" she says while bouncing her toddler on her knee. ""There have been many more explosions and it became too dangerous to stay there. ""I didn't want to leave home, but I had no choice."" This car park represents Ukraine controlling what it can. Unable to force the Russians from Europe's biggest nuclear power plant, the country is instead trying to prepare for the worst, if it happens.

"Some victims were buried on the outskirts of the city A huge explosion has ripped through a crowded mosque in the Afghan capital Kabul, killing 21 people, police say. Another 33 people were injured, Kabul police spokesman Khalid Zadran added. Wednesday's blast occurred during evening prayers. The mosque's imam Amir Muhammad Kabuli is reported to be among the dead. It is unclear who was behind the attack, a week after Islamic State (IS) militants killed a pro-Taliban cleric in a suicide bomb blast, also in Kabul. The Talibanâs secretive war against IS Security forces have now sealed off the blast scene in Kabul. Witnesses described hearing a powerful explosion which shattered windows in nearby buildings. ""I saw that so many people were killed, even people were thrown out of the windows of the mosque,"" one eyewitness told Reuters news agency. Stefano Sozza, the head of the medical charity Emergency, which runs the city's main hospital, told the BBC his group had already treated 35 people, including children. ""Our doctors... operated [on] the patients in need of surgical assistance all night long. The injuries were mainly related to the blast, so there were shells inside the bodies and burning injuries all over the bodies of the victims."" He said he believed the blast was inside the mosque. ""There was probably someone entering during the prayer time, so it was crowded at that moment and then [the attacker] activated this body burning improvised explosive device. ""So that all the persons that were close to the attacker were basically dead and the ones all around received several injuries,"" Mr Sozza said. News agency AP quoted Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid as saying that the ""perpetrators of such crimes will soon be brought to justice and will be punished"". But in a series of tweets, the UN mission in Afghanistan (Unama) urged the Taliban to take ""concrete steps"" to prevent terrorism and provide additional support to vulnerable communities. It said the attack was ""the latest in a disturbing series of bombings,externalwhich have killed & injured more than 250 people in recent weeks, the highest monthly number of civilian casualties over the last year"". Senior Taliban officials are meeting more than 2,000 tribal and religious elders on Thursday in Afghanistan's second city Kandahar, the movement's main power base. A spokesman quoted by AFP news agency said ""important decisions"" would be taken at the major gathering. The Kabul bombing comes days after theassassination of prominent cleric and Taliban supporter Rahimullah Haqqaniin a suicide bombing. The Islamic State group said it carried out the attack on Mr Haqqani, one of the highest profile figures to be killed since the Taliban returned to power a year ago. The mosque was crowded, the bomb powerful, and another cleric seems to have been in the sights of Islamic State, the group which has emerged as the Taliban's most potent enemy. In the past month, three prominent religious leaders were targeted in Kabul and there were assassinations in other cities. Last week it was Sheikh Rahimullah Haqqani, known to be close to the Taliban. This time it's Amir Muhammad Kabuli, said to be an adherent of the more moderate Sufi faith. Video posted on social media showed a scene of carnage. One religious student who was just outside the mosque told the BBC he saw the bodies of the dead and injured sprawled inside, including children attending evening prayers. IS's signature has been its devastating attacks on the minority Shia Hazara community. But their focus now seems to be widening just as the Taliban celebrate their one year in power - a takeover which ended one chapter of a long bloody war but only ushered in yet another. These Islamist groups have long been split along ideological and religious lines, deepened by intense personal and political rivalries. The Taliban don't share IS's adherence to an austere Salafist creed, its global jihadi ambitions and the most savage of tactics; IS reviles the Taliban for its diplomatic engagement in recent years with the US and other Western powers.

"The rapid decline in the use of cash during the pandemic has eased as consumers return to their preferred method of paying for things, a report suggests. Many people were forced into trying alternative ways of spending owing to Covid restrictions, banking trade body UK Finance said. But it added that their preferred method had not changed radically. Cash use is still forecast to drop, accounting for 6% of payments by 2031. ""Rather than the UK becoming a cash-free society over the next decade, the UK will transition to an economy where cash is less important than it once was but remains valued and preferred by many,"" the report said. The trend of the last decade has been the significant rise in the prevalence of card - and particularly contactless - payments. Debit or credit cards were used in 57% of all payments in the UK last year. In comparison, the use of notes and coins has dropped from 55% of payments in 2011 to 15% last year. During the pandemic, the number of payments made in total fell. In particular, cash use slumped during lockdowns and as retailers encouraged friction-free payments. Now, the UK Finance report suggests that long-term trends will continue as if there has been no pandemic impact. While 42% of consumers only made one transaction or fewer in cash each month, Adrian Buckle, head of research at UK Finance, said that many people were returning to their first preference when paying. ""Payment trends generally tend to change slowly, as we all form habits about the way we pay for things and these don't change easily,"" he said. 'I've taught my mum some things about finance' Warning millions would struggle if cash phased out Natalie Ceeney, who leads work into access to cash, said: ""It's now widely recognised that those who rely on cash tend to be older, poorer or more vulnerable, many of whom simply can't 'go digital'. ""I'm really pleased that, after many years of campaigning on the issue, the industry is working hard to put in solutions and we should finally have legislation to protect access to cash in the next few months."" Another factor in the use of cash is the rising cost of living. Mr Buckle said cash became slightly more popular during the financial crisis at the start of the last decade but, like then, it had relatively little impact on the longer term decline. The Post Office recently reported that its counters handled Â£801m in personal cash withdrawals in July,the most since records began five years ago. It said customers' use of cash to budget and the popularity of staycations were behind the increase. In May, Salford University student Kira Hayward told the BBC that she turned to social media for inspiration to help her cope with rising costs by taking cash out of her bank account. Student Kira Hayward limits her spending by using ""budget binders"" for cash She puts it in different labelled envelopes to ensure she has money for food and bills. ""I went on Instagram and YouTube and I saw these physical budget binders,"" she said. ""I take the money out of the bank and I budget for things like my shopping. If I know I have Â£80 in my personal shopping for the month I know I can't go over that."" However, the UK Finance report suggested that young people were becoming adept at budgeting using smartphone apps and were keeping a keen eye on their bank balance digitally. Mr Buckle said they would log into accounts several times a day. Instead of using cash to budget, many would consider any cash withdrawals as money already ""spent"" as it had already reduced the bank balance they saw on the screen. The report also questioned the assumption that younger people were more reliant than others on Buy Now, Pay Later products. The trade body's limited research suggested about one in eight people had used these services, but they were most likely to be aged between 35 and 44.

""If something like this was possible, we would be interested in talking with a view to long-term ownership."" Jim Ratcliffe - who is the man bidding for Man Utd? Man Utd news and views in one place United, 20-time English champions, are bottom of the Premier League after losing both their opening games of the season under new manager Erik ten Hag. The woeful start has intensified criticism of the Glazers and their perceived lack of investment in the team. This summer has seen new signings fail to materialise, including a fruitless pursuit of Barcelona's Dutch midfielder Frenkie de Jong, while superstar striker Cristiano Ronaldocould leave Old Trafford. The club has struggled since Sir Alex Ferguson retired in 2013 and has not won a trophy since 2017. There have been multiple protests against the Glazers' ownership in recent years, including one in May 2021 which caused the Red Devils' home league match against Liverpool to be postponed.

"Fruit and vegetables on the shelves will be smaller and look different as the summer's hot and dry weather hits crops, experts say. Potatoes, onions, carrots, apples and Brussels sprouts are likely to be worst-affected. Many areas of the UK have seen very low rainfall in 2022, and parts of England are in drought. The National Farmers Union (NFU) wants supermarkets to accept more ""wonky"" produce and be flexible with growers. In Essex, farmer Sarah Green's fields are dusty and the grass crunches beneath her feet. Her crops are ""alive, but not growing or thriving"". The hot summer sun made her sweetcorn delicious, but smaller than usual and she's had to lower her prices. Other crops still in the ground, like cauliflower, Brussels sprouts and broccoli, are stunted. Sarah Green has already seen her summer produce grow smaller And in Herefordshire, farmer Ben Andrews said his ""nice green"" cabbage and kale were fine until a few days ago. Now they've turned pale blue, he says. They feel leathery and tough, no longer crisp and lush. These crops are still in the fields but soon they'll be what we buy in supermarkets. It's too early to know how much UK produce will die due to drought, but ""crop quality"" will certainly be hit, Jerry Knox, professor of agricultural water management at Cranfield University, told BBC News. Where has drought been declared? 'Every day it doesn't rain, the pressure mounts' Why downpours may not help drought More potatoes will be smaller, with lower quality skin and even some defects, he adds. Vegetables this autumn and winter ""may not look normal, but will taste the same"", Tom Bradshaw, vice-president of the NFU, says. ""Consumers have been conditioned to believe that a potato looks a certain way,"" Mr Bradshaw says. To reduce the risk of even more price rises during a cost of living crisis, ""we need to be more relaxed about appearance"", he adds. A representative for the British Retail Consortium (BRC) told BBC News that supermarkets already accepted odd-shaped vegetables. ""Retailers understand weather conditions have been a challenge and have taken steps to support their farmers. This includes expanding ranges of odd-size/shape fruit and veg when needed,"" says Hannah Dougherty, Food Policy Advisor at the BRC. In Essex, rain is all Sarah Green and her family talk about. This year they're measured 107mm of rainfall. Their annual average is 525mm. Rain could help these cauliflowers recover but they will be smaller This dryness means vegetables in the ground can't get the moisture they need to keep growing, so they grow slower and don't become full-size. Lack of water can make the skin tougher, or cause defects as the crop is stressed. Potatoes are very vulnerable to drought in the UK where half the national crop is fed by rain, Prof Jerry Knox explains. Harvesting the potatoes will be a challenge because it's likely to be difficult to get the harvester into the hard ground, Sarah Green explains. It might form big clods that damage the crop or cut it into pieces. Carrots, parsnips, onions will be affected in a similar way to potatoes, Prof Knox says. By this point in the summer the ""damage is done"", he says, and even significant rainfall isn't enough to fix the stressed potatoes. Farmers are also worried about brassicas like cauliflowers and broccoli planted in autumn. In many areas it's feared the soil is too hard to dig and seeds won't survive in parched ground. The last time the UK had a drought was in 2018, but rains came just in time to save most crops. But this year the Met Office is forecasting several months of dry, warm weather. Farmers could choose to sacrifice some crops, in order to fully water others, Prof Knox says. Gathering enough water over the autumn and winter will also be crucial to stop the effects of drought spreading into 2023. But in the long-term scientists warn that parts of England, particularly the south-east, will become much drier due to climate change. Farmers do adapt and some have changed the crops they grow, but the unpredictability of UK weather makes that risky. Alastair Chisholm of the Chartered Institution of Water and Environmental Management says that in the long-term, adjustments to farming techniques like regenerative farming that helps soil store water, as well as investment in storage for winter rains, can be solutions.

"Peter Coshan was last seen in Edinburgh on 11 August Detectives are treating the disappearance of a former teacher at Edinburgh's Fettes College as murder. Dr Peter Coshan, 75, was last seen in the Seafield Road area of Edinburgh at about 23:50 on 11 August and was reported missing the next day. Two men, aged 27 and 63, have been arrested and charged. Mr Coshan, who taught biology at former prime minister Tony Blair's old school, is presumed dead but his body has not been found. The arrested men are due to appear at Edinburgh Sheriff Court on Thursday. Fettes College said it was ""shocked and deeply saddened"" to hear of the disappearance. Mr Coshan was a member of the teaching staff from 1972 until his retirement in 2005.  He joined a year after Tony Blair attended the school, from 1966 to 1971. Helen Harrison, head of Fettes College, said: ""Peter was an inspirational biology teacher and he will be remembered fondly by many. ""Not least by those who were taught by him, tutored by him and introduced to the hills through his enthusiasm for the Duke of Edinburgh Award Scheme, which he ran for 33 years."" Detectives areappealing to the public for information.,external Det Supt Andrew Patrick said extensive inquiries were ongoing to trace Mr Coshan, whose home in Stockbridge is four miles from where he was last seen. He added: ""I would encourage anyone with any information regarding Peter's disappearance to contact police as a matter of urgency.

"Ukrainian emergency rescuers attend an exercise in case of a possible nuclear incident at Zaporizhzhia's nuclear plant. It is relatively unusual in Ukraine for a government official to invite you on a short-notice trip. It turns out it is more common for that invitation to come with very little detail. The main reason for that is security - it is not exactly wise to publicise when a minister is going to be somewhere, especially when you are being invaded by another country. We decided to accept, and soon found ourselves at an airfield near Kyiv, where we and other journalists were led onto a helicopter. By this point we knew our destination was the city of Zaporizhzhia, and the subject was the growing danger from the region's nuclear power plant further south. Within 30 seconds of the journey starting, I realised why we were offered anti-nausea tablets before taking off. To stay undetected, the pilot keeps the helicopter around 10 metres off the ground, occasionally hurdling over electric powerlines. There are endless fields of sunflowers. Some are in full bloom, some are wilting, past their best. Regardless, the harvest is fast approaching. Then there is the dense woodland - thousands upon thousands of towering trees which come so close to touching the skids of the chopper. You are left under no illusion of Ukraine's vast and rich landscape. After landing in Zaporizhzhia, you are struck by two things: the more industrial skyline in comparison to Kyiv, as well as the humidity. We end up at a supermarket car park where emergency workers are dressed in yellow hazmat suits. They are practising cleaning drills in the event of a radioactive contamination. Ukraine's last nuclear crisis was the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear incident, when a Soviet-era reactor exploded. They are watched by senior officials, who are keen to see how ready the region would be in the event of a worst-case scenario. ""Of course we are concerned,"" Ukraine's Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko tells me. ""The situation changed dramatically when the Russians started shelling the area on 5 August."" Ukraine says the situation at the plant is ""approaching critical"". Russian forces have occupied the site, Europe's biggest, since early March. They have been urged to hand control back because of the dangers, and some staff there have told the BBC they're ""being kept at gunpoint"". For the past two weeks there's been heavy shelling on and around the plant, with the sides blaming each other. Nato is the latest international organisation to call for United Nations inspectors to be let into the Zaporizhzhia power plant, claiming its seizure posed a serious threat to Ukraine and neighbouring countries. Ukraine nuclear workers: We're kept at gunpoint Real risk of nuclear disaster in Ukraine - watchdog Officials say the plant could be cut off from power as Moscow tries to redirect electricity to Crimea, which it annexed eight years ago. ""It is impossible to ensure the safety of the nuclear power plant while the Russian occupying forces are there,"" says Denys Monastyrskyy, Ukraine's interior minister. ""It is the key concern that we all should understand,"" he adds. Ukraineâs Interior Minister Denys Monastyrskyy says the situation at the plant is âapproaching criticalâ The car park is also a place where Ukrainians who manage to make it out of Russian-occupied territories first arrive. There are queues of cars with people and full suitcases. Sitting in the shade we meet Olena, who has just made it out of the city of Enerhodar, where the nuclear plant is located. ""It's scary, very scary, there is shelling all the time,"" she says while bouncing her toddler on her knee. ""There have been many more explosions and it became too dangerous to stay there. ""I didn't want to leave home, but I had no choice."" This car park represents Ukraine controlling what it can. Unable to force the Russians from Europe's biggest nuclear power plant, the country is instead trying to prepare for the worst, if it happens.

"This video can not be played Watch: Footage shows flash flooding across southern England Thunderstorms and flash floods have struck parts of southern England, causing flash flooding in large areas of central London. Intense downpours began in London and swept the South East on Wednesday. High Beech, in Essex, saw the highest rainfall with 64mm falling in a 24-hour period, while Frittenden in Kent had 46mm of rain falling in one hour. Light and patchy rain in localised areas is expected over the next few days. The Met Office forecasts that Thursday will be damp in Northern Ireland and western Scotland as rain moves eastwards, with cloudy weather across south-east England and brighter spells for Wales and central England in the afternoon. Check the latest forecast where you are It follows a day whereheavy rain in the capitalaffected swathes of central London, including Bloomsbury, St Pancras station, Victoria and Kentish Town. Some shops and platforms at Victoria Station were forced to close after flooding at the main entrance led to large volumes of water running down a slope towards the eastern concourse. Rain filled the north London high streets of Stoke Newington and Stamford Hill, with cars seen struggling to drive through the water. The Almeida Theatre in Islington had to cancel a matinee performance as water leaked through the roof. Rain brought play to a halt at the Test match between England and South Africa at Lord's Cricket Ground The outline of St Paul's Cathedral can just be made out as people walk in the rain on Millennium Bridge in London Heavy rainfall led to roads across England, Wales and Scotland becoming flooded on Tuesday, following weeks of extreme heat and tinder-dry conditions. Gatwick Airport in Crawley, West Sussex, has warned of delays and cancellations to some flights as air traffic control restrictions were declared across the south due to poor weather. Worksop in Nottinghamshire experienced 93mm of rainfall between 17:00 and 20:00 BST on Tuesday -almost twice the average monthly rainfall of 54mm, according to BBC weather presenter Simon King. And more heavy rainfall is expected in England and Wales, with the most intense rain likely to fall in the South East covering London, Kent, West Sussex, Essex and Suffolk. BBC Weather's Stav Danaos said: ""Low pressure pushing in off the Atlantic will bring more of a breeze during Thursday, and this weather front will bring a band of cloud and rain which will slowly spread from west to east across the country. ""So initially we start of with quite a bit of cloud around, one or two heavy showers in the south east, but increasing amounts of sunshine for central, southern and eastern areas into the afternoon."" He added temperatures are set to peak at 25C in the south-east. A sudden downpour in Brighton saw daytrippers seek cover A series of flood alerts were issued for areas of London A total of eight areas of England are officially in drought despite the downpours this week, withThames Water becoming the latest water provider to announce a hosepipe ban, which will come into force later this month. Pollution warnings are also in place for dozens of beaches in England and Wales after untreated sewage was discharged into the sea around the coast following the period of heavy rain. Water companies faced criticism, including after untreated sewage had beenreleased upstream of popular swimming spot Warleigh Weir, along the River Avon. Southern Water, one of the companies responsible for the affected regions, said storm releases were made to ""protect homes, schools and businesses from flooding"", adding the release was ""95-97% rainwater"". Roads flooded in Worksop, Nottinghamshire Sewage pumping station overwhelmed in Totton, Hampshire Businesses shut in Dorset Road closures and car park flooded in Leicestershire Heavy downpours are unlikely to ease parched conditions seen across much of the UK, however, because rainwater struggles to permeate dry ground. The conditions mean water will be more likely to run off the dehydrated surface, leading to flash flooding in some areas. Additional reporting by Rachel Russell.

"""You don't expect your trauma to only really begin once you're in the care system,"" says Michela ââââThree children's homes have closed and two more rated ""inadequate"" following a BBC investigation into a firm making huge profits. The homes, previously rated as good or outstanding, were re-inspected after the BBC found children had reported being groomed and assaulted. We can also reveal the company failed to fully report some serious incidents. Calcot Services for Children does not accept the BBC's allegations and says profits were not excessive. Followingthe BBC's investigation in June, Ofsted re-inspected seven of the company's homes in southern England. We have now learned the regulator for England has rated five homes ""inadequate"" - and three of those have now closed. At one, ""serious and widespread failures"" were found with staff not providing some one-to-one care which local councils had paid for, echoing our previous findings. Our continuing investigation has spoken to more than 20 current and former Calcot employees - and has seen new leaked documents and emails. The BBC can now reveal: A former resident has spoken out for the first time, describing how she wasgroomed by a carer A former member of staff claims a manager""covered up""a serious sexual assault allegation involving two children Calcotfailed to reporttwo alleged incidents involving children to a local authority safeguarding manager Fivewhistleblowers- all Calcot staff - contacted Ofsted with concerns more than a year ago Calcot has used a business structure which is legal, but not subject to the samefinancial scrutinyas limited companies Calcot does not accept the BBC's allegations but says an independent review will address issues raised by our investigation and Ofsted. It says it disputes the BBC's characterisation of its profits and says they could not be compared with other companies which are structured differently. Names have been changed to protect identities of former residents and staff. Michela was groomed aged 17 by a man originally employed as the company's marketing manager but then redeployed to a home where older teenagers are given more independence - known as supported living. Speaking out for the first time, she says she wasn't moved from the residence for months after reporting the abuse - and stopped washing and eating because she didn't want to leave her room. ""The only safe place I had in that building was the bedroom, as it was the one place nothing had happened in,"" she says, now aged 19 and waiving her right to absolute anonymity. ""I've never had a man that's shown so much interest in me,"" says Michela Michela's grooming began when Tatenda Shoniwa started following her on social media and messaging her about her life - sometimes until the early hours of the morning. ""I wasn't used to that. I've never had a man that's shown so much interest in me, never had a parent figure,"" she says. Shoniwa is now in prison for abusing his position and sexual activity with a child. Michela says she feels ""completely betrayed"" by some of the other Calcot staff members, who she believes were aware of what he was doing but did not report anything. ""Coming into care you're coming away from trauma"", she says. ""You don't expect for your trauma to only really begin once you're in the system."" The BBC has also now learned that Ofsted discovered that staff at multiple homes did not have adequate training. At one, now closed, inspectors said almost no-one had been trained to handle ligatures or cases of child sexual exploitation - despite it housing children with documented risks of both. In addition, we now know that five managers have left Calcot in the past 18 months after developing concerns about how the company was being run. We had alreadyheard from whistleblowerswho told us they believed the company was putting profit before childcare - and inadequately staffing some homes. Another teenager, Tara - who has learning difficulties and is autistic - was supposed to have two support staff to help, but she says she was often left alone. She frequently asked her local authority social workers if she could move elsewhere, she says. Tara says she was often left unsupervised Calcot then decided to move her, despite staff concerns, into one of its supported living placements where she would have more independence rather than full-time care. The 17-year-old, who lived there with an adult in their early twenties, says she was able to regularly go missing without staff noticing. ""The staff didn't really do anything because it's an adult placement. They do their own thing - on their phones 24/7,"" she says. ""I felt like they weren't looking after me."" Calcot says it follows appropriate referral processes so children are not placed in unsuitable homes. Management also failed to correctly report allegations of child-on-child sexual abuse, the BBC can reveal. We previously reported that two children had been found in May 2021 undressed and without supervision. They both later alleged they had been sexually assaulted. A former support worker, Mia, told us management assured her the incident had been reported to authorities - but Ofsted told the BBC it hadn't. Now, another ex-staff member says she and a manager discussed the children's allegations, but in a later email, seen by the BBC, the manager provided draft wording for a report to social workers which only said that they had been ""found together in each other's rooms"" - with no reference to the sexual assault allegations. Do you have more information about this story? You can reach Noel directly and securely through encrypted messaging app Signal on: +44 7809 334720 or by email at noel.titheradge@bbc.co.uk The former employee says she knew it was wrong to exclude the allegations from her report and believed she had been left ""powerless"" when asked to do so. She says it was ""completely immoral"" not to fully report the children's claims. Former support worker Mia describes what happened as a ""cover-up"". ""[The manager] didn't have the welfare of the children as a priority,"" she says. Calcot says it did report the incident to Ofsted and the relevant local authority designated officer - known as a ""LADO"" - who is responsible for safeguarding. But we know this only happened after our initial investigation - more than a year after the incident. Two other incidents in Calcot homes in the past year also weren't immediately reported to a local authority designated officer - even though they are expected to do so. One involved a boy who alleged he had been punched by a male member of staff while being restrained. It is understood the child later denied the assault took place - but nevertheless a LADO should have been told. Calcot says this decision not to report the alleged assault was taken by the home manager, not a senior manager. The other incident involved another boy who said their arm had been trapped in a car window by a staff member. While not reported to a local authority designated officer, Calcot says it was reported to Ofsted and the boy's social worker - and that the company always makes the relevant reports as required. If you have been affected by any of these issues in this story you can visitBBC Action Line. The BBC has now learned that five Calcot whistleblowers contacted Ofsted about their concerns before we began our investigation. When we published our initial findings in June, all the homes were rated good or outstanding. Ofsted says it does not investigate whistleblowing complaints specifically but says action against Calcot was already under way when the BBC report was released. Last week, Ofsted's chief inspector, Amanda Spielman, said the law needed to change to give more powers to inspect providers of children's homes - which, she said, were inferior to those for adult care homes. Already, in light of the BBC's June report, the Children's Commissioner for England, Dame Rachel de Souza,has called for ""radical reform"". Calcot's profit margin in 2021 was 36% - more than twice the level termed excessive by a government watchdog Calcot has used a business structure called a partnership, the BBC has found, where accounts are subject to less stringent reporting obligations than a limited company. Ofsted says while it is aware of providers across England operating as partnerships, it does not know the total number. Three local authorities have told us they were asked by Calcot to direct payments into a bank account which is used for its partnership. The BBC understands that money was paid back into the firm's limited company account - which recorded huge profits last year. Calcot's profit margin in 2021 was 36% - more than twice the level termed excessive by a government watchdog. Calcot told us the use of the partnership accounts was an ""administrative error on the part of the local authorities"". It added that a number of factors, including built-up investment, made its profits across homes and schools appear bigger than they really were. The owners of Calcot, Sukhbir and Harvinder Singh, declined to be interviewed. In June, the company said it prioritised safeguarding all children in its care and its homes were all staffed correctly. Its lawyers say the BBC has a distorted view of the company and its sources have an axe to grind. They add that Calcot's whistleblowing policy allows concerns to be raised anonymously, so they can be quickly addressed. The Department for Education declined to be interviewed. It said it was investing in raising standards and increasing the number of children's home placements.

"Tuition fees in England and Wales will rise next year, after universities called for help with their finances. What are the changes and does getting a degree pay for itself through higher future earnings? The annual cost of an undergraduate degree in England and Wales will go up from Â£9,250 to Â£9,535 in the 2025/26 academic year. The changes will apply from 1 August 2025. Undergraduate students will also be able to borrow more for day-to-day living costs. The maximum maintenance loan for students from England, who live away from their parents outside of London, for example, will increase from Â£10,227 to Â£10,544 a year. The rise was first announced in England, where the government said the increases to tuition fees and maintenance loans were in line with inflation. The Welsh government then said it would bring fees in line with England. University tuition fees set to rise in England Welsh tuition fees to rise by nearly Â£300 a year Everything you need to know about student loans Warnings have been mounting about the state of university finances. The regulator in England, the Office for Students, warned that 40% of universities have predicted a deficit in this academic year. Inflation means tuition fees are worth less than they used to be, and there have been fewer international students to make up the financial shortfall. Students have been warned they could see cuts to staffing and courses as a result. Universities UK, which represents 141 universities,suggested in September that funding per student would have to be Â£12,500to meet universities' tuition costs - although it stressed it would not call for the tuition fee cap to be set that high. Announcing the tuition fee rise in England, Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson said there were ""severe financial challenges"" in higher education: ""With tuition fees frozen, universities have suffered real terms-decline in income."" However, the government has also said universities should ""manage their budgets"". UK nations set their own fees. In Northern Ireland, the maximum annual cost of an undergraduate degree is  Â£4,750 for Northern Irish students or Â£9,250 for other UK students. In Scotland, undergraduate tuition is free for the majority of Scottish students and Â£9,250 for other UK students. Student rents have risen sharply in recent years,according to data from 10 university towns and cities.,external Average annual rent rose from Â£6,520 in 2021-22 to Â£7,475 in 2023-24, according to research by the Higher Education Policy Institute (Hepi) and housing charity Unipol. The figures do not include London and Edinburgh. Student rents were particularly high in some cities like Bristol and Nottingham, where the average cost was Â£9,200 and Â£8,427 respectively. Hepi warned that maintenance loans in England only just cover average rent, and without family support or part-time work, students ""will have no money to live off"" after paying housing costs. If you are leaving home to study, it is generally cheaper to live in university-owned accommodation. In 2021-22(the latest UK-wide figures available),externalaverage rent for university owned rooms ranged from Â£6,471 in England to Â£4,565 in Northern Ireland. 'I got into uni but had nowhere to live' Students also need to budget for other big expenses, such as food, transport, course materials and going out. Research by the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service (Ucas), based on a survey of about 500 respondents, suggests thatstudents spent Â£219 per week on average in late 2022.,external In June 2023,Hepi said that more than half of students had a job. Most UK students are eligible for a tuition fee loan. Maintenance loans are also available for living costs. These are means-tested, so the amount you get depends on your family's income. The maximum maintenance loan if you live away from home and outside London ranges from Â£10,227 in England (before next year's increase) to Â£6,776 in Northern Ireland. You are charged interest on your total loan from the day you take it out. Eligibility and repayment rules differ across the UK. Loan repayment rules changed in England in 2023, meaning students are likely to pay back more, over a longer period of time, than those who went to university earlier. The government says new students ""will not repay more than they originally borrowed over the lifetime of their loans, when adjusted for inflation"". But MoneySavingExpert.com's Martin Lewis said extending the repayment periodwould increase ""costs by thousands"" for lower and mid-earners.,external Gov.uk - student finance calculator,external Everything you need to know about student loans Eligible students in Wales and Northern Ireland can claim maintenance grants which do not have to be repaid. Full-time undergraduates normally resident in Wales areentitled to at least Â£1,000.,externalStudents from the poorest backgrounds who study in London can get up to Â£10,124. In Northern Irelandthe maximum grant is Â£3,475.,external The Scottish government offersfinancial support to certain categories of students,,externalsuch as those with dependants. Across the UK, students in financial difficulty can apply for hardship funding and they may also be entitled tofinancial assistance from charities.,external Most students will leave university owing money. The Student Loans Company says graduates in England leave university with average debts of Â£48,470. In general, most graduates can expect to earn more than non-graduates,according to the Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA).,external However, it suggests the amount of extra money earned after a university education has declined. According to HESA's survey of 2020-21 graduates, the average salary reported 15 monthsafter gaining a degree was Â£29,699.,external Earnings also depend on the subject studied and university attended. Research by the IFS think tank,externalin England suggests, on average, women who studied creative arts and languages degrees earned the same amount in their lifetime as if they had not gone to university. Women who studied law, economics or medicine earned over Â£250,000 more during their career than if they had not got a degree. Men who studied creative arts on average earned less across their lifetimes than if they had not attended university. Male medicine or economics graduates earned Â£500,000 more. Attending university can help students from poorer backgrounds earn more than their parents might have done, according toresearch by education charity the Sutton Trust,externalin England. But only a fifth of graduates who were eligible for free school meals went on to be in the top 20% of earners - compared toalmost half of graduates who attended private schools.,external The Sutton Trust says attending a selective university, like a Russell Group one, gives young people the ""best chance of being socially mobile"".

"Rubbish piles up on Edinburgh streets on the first day of the strike People living in Edinburgh have been warned to expect ""significant disruption"" as the city's waste workers have launched a 12-day strike. Unions haverejected a pay offer equivalent to a 3.5% increaseand the Edinburgh strike is the first of a series planned across Scotland. The industrial action comes in the final weeks of the Edinburgh festivals. Workers picketing outside Edinburgh City Chambers were joined by council leader Cammy Day. The Labour councillor saidmore money was needed from the Scottish governmentto allow a better offer to be made to the striking workers. Nicola Sturgeon has said council leaders should make a 5% pay offer to staff to avert further strikes. Scottish council workers reject pay offer from Cosla Inflation drives fastest fall in real pay on record The first minister said it was ""really disappointing"" that Â£140m of extra Scottish government funding had not resolved the pay row. Hundreds of GMB and Unite union members in Edinburgh's waste and recycling service will be on strike until 30 August - the day after the end of the city's International and Fringe festivals. Bins overflow as festival visitors gather at Hunter Square A recycling point on Edinburgh's Grassmarket is strewn with cardboard waste They will be joined by further strike action from workers in waste and recycling services across Scottish local government on 26 and 29 August, as well as between 7 and 10 September. GMB Scotland organiser Kirsten Muat has warned of huge disruption to life in Scotland's capital city. She said: ""Waste will pile up for the remainder of the Festival and when people ask why we will tell them, GMB members are not prepared to accept working poverty in our local services as an inevitability even if our political leaders are. ""The 3.5% tabled last week - a miserly lift on the previously rejected 2%  - is a pathetic response while our members struggle against double-digit inflation and energy bills rising to over Â£4,000 this winter. ""If political leaders want to avoid the prospect of more strikes across more councils in the weeks to come, then they must urgently make a significantly improved pay offer."" The Edinburgh strike will be followed by a second wave of action by waste workers across Scotland. It is a coordinated effort by Unite, Unison and the GMB unions to get an improved council pay deal. Unite - 24 to 31 AugustAberdeen, Angus, Clackmannanshire, Dundee, East Ayrshire, East Lothian, East Renfrewshire, Edinburgh, Falkirk, Glasgow, Highland, Inverclyde, South Ayrshire, South Lanarkshire and West Lothian. Unison - August 26 to 29 and September 7 to 10Aberdeenshire, Clackmannanshire, East Renfrewshire, Glasgow, Inverclyde, North Lanarkshire, Stirling and South Lanarkshire GMB - August 26 to 29 and September 7 to 10Aberdeen, Angus, Dundee, East Ayrshire, East Lothian, Falkirk, Glasgow, Inverclyde, Highland, Midlothian, Orkney, South Ayrshire, South Lanarkshire, West Lothian, Perth and Kinross, and North Lanarkshire. Eddie Cassidy, from Unite Scotland, toldBBC Radio's Good Morning Scotlandthat councils were an ""an easy target"" for Scottish government cuts. ""They have reduced funding for local government well in excess of what they should have over the past 10 years,"" he said. ""My members have been scrimping and scraping over the past ten years, and the time has come to say enough is enough. ""They cant afford to buy their messages, they can't afford to send their kids to school, they cannot afford their bus fares. It's an absolute disgrace in a country like ours."" Union members rally outside Edinburgh's city council chambers Edinburgh City Council said it was anticipating all bin collections and street cleaning in the city would be affected in the coming weeks. The city's three recycling centres will be closed and bulky uplift and fly-tipping services will also be paused as a result of the action. As agreed with the trade unions, some waste collections will take place in care homes, special schools and blocks of flats with bin chutes. Council leader Cammy Day said: ""I firmly believe that all council colleagues deserve to be paid fairly for the work they do and have every right to take this action and have their voices heard. ""As the lowest funded council in Scotland, it's time for the Scottish government to properly fund our capital city and its services."" Last week Cosla resources spokeswoman Katie Hagmann said: ""Leaders have reaffirmed their aspiration to make an offer greater than the initial 2% but note the risk that public services will not recover, jobs will be affected and communities will see services reduced."" The Scottish government said it expected local government to match its Â£140m contribution to help them give staff a bigger pay rise. Meanwhile, Scotland will also be hit by disruption on the railways on Thursday, with strike action by the RMT union across the UK impacting on the signalling provisions north of the border. As a result only a few train services will be available, mostly in the central belt.

"Top grades for A-level results for England, Wales and Northern Ireland have fallen since last year â with 36.4% of all grades marked at A* or A But the percentage is still higher than 2019 â the last time results were based on students taking exams Grades have been purposefully lowered from levels seen in 2020 and 2021 - when students were assessed by teachers due to the pandemic Students have also received their T-level results for the first time ever - the overall pass rate was 92% These technical qualifications are each broadly equivalent to three A-levels, and involve a mix of classroom learning and industry placements More than 425,000 students have got a place in university or college - the second highest number on record - Ucas figures show A return to in-person exams sees 19% more 18-year-olds accepted into their first or insurance choice than in 2019 Edited by Alice Cuddy and Chris Giles It's been a big day for teenagers receiving their results and working out their next steps. Here's a quick look back at what happened:  Today's coverage was brought to you by Vanessa Clarke, George Crafer, Alys Davies, James FitzGerald, Marita Moloney and Nathan Standley. The page was edited by Alice Cuddy and Chris Giles. For those that did not get the
grades they wanted, results day can be tough. âI know right now it probably
feels like the end of the world, but it really isn't,"" says 22-year old
Alexandra Offer. She didn't get into her first
choice university on results day. ""Leeds was my firm [favourite], and they had rejected me. I rang them up and
asked if there was any way I could get in and they said: no sorry,"" she recalls. She went to Cardiff University
instead. ""I've absolutely loved it,
I wouldn't change it for a thing. Everything happens for a reason and obviously
Cardiff was the place for me to go,"" she says. She is now about to finish her
Masters degree and is starting a job as Executive Search Consultant. ""I'm literally a prime
example of [how] you can still be successful and get to where you want to
be."" Nathan StandleyEducation reporter We've been hearing how some BTec and CTec students have had their results delayed - leaving some worried that their university place might be hanging in the balance. But Ucas has sought to reassure those students that their offers will be held to ensure that they have time to get their grades confirmed. Although some might be concerned about clearing places being taken up, the admission service adds that ""the important thing is not to panic"". âStudents
may find they are awaiting their examination results for many reasons, and not
all qualifications are awarded on JCQ results day,"" a spokesman told us. ""Universities are used to
managing this in their processes, and we are working with awarding bodies to
ensure all students can receive a decision on their application. ""Ucas advises that universities hold offers
until 7th September, so any student that has yet to receive their
qualification results has time to meet this. Students are also free to start
their clearing research should they wish,"" he added. Shadow education secretary Bridget Phillipson accuses the Tories of failing young people Labour is warning that some parts of England have witnessed more
of a drop in students getting top grades than others. Nationally, there was a fall of 8.4 percentage points in pupils getting A* or A grades compared to 2021 - when pupils were assessed by their teachers due to the pandemic. Some 36% of A-level entries gained marks in those top categories this year - up from 25.4% in 2019. But the fall was sharper for students in the North East, Yorkshire and Humber, and the East Midlands, than for those in London and the South East, Labour analysis of the data shows. ""These inequalities reveal the Conservativesâ continued failure to enable
all young people to thrive post-pandemic,"" said the party's shadow education secretary, Bridget Phillipson. Education Minister Will Quince told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme that the attainment gap was narrowing year on year, but that more work could be done. Two exam boards - Pearson and OCR - have told us they are working to resolve delays in some BTec and CTec results being returned to students. Students and their families have said they are concerned that without these final grades, their university places can't be confirmed - all as more and more clearing places are taken up by other students. Both exam boards have been responding on social media asking students to contact them privately so they can ""review and advise"" them as quickly as possible. Pearson have also recommended affected students should call them on 0345 618 0440. The number of top A* and A grades awarded in Northern Ireland has fallen from last year. But the proportion of top grades is much higher than in 2019 - the last time when results were based on exams. About 44% of A-level entries have been awarded A* or A grades this year, compared to a record 51% in 2021. In 2019, when exams were last held in person, just over 30% of entries were awarded the top two grades. You can read more about Northern Ireland's results here.  Earlier we told you that English Literature has dropped out of the top 10 most popular A-levels this year.

In England, students were given additional detail this year due to disruption caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. However,an AQA A-level law exam included topics students were not expecting. A spokesperson for AQA admitted the issues made the exam âmore challengingâ for students, but said grade boundaries for the affected paper were lowered. However, some students at Outwood Post-16 Centre in Workshop, Nottinghamshire, said it made them âlose all composureâ during the exam. Shaun Da CostaNewsbeat Reporter Lana Cardo, 17, is studying a T-level in Health Assistant Adult Nursing at The Manchester College. In her first year of T-levels, which are two-year courses equivalent to three A levels, she got an A*, A and B. âI was really happy when I got them, I wasnât expecting that at all,â she told BBC Newsbeat. Lana described the course as âa really in depth course in terms of theory and practicalâ. We have done placements within a hospital which have been really insightful into the workforce and healthcare sector. And a lot of the theory has been based on legislation and other healthcare which has been really good.â  Lana will be applying to university later this year and said she was hoping to go to Manchester or Salford. The first students to take T-levels have been receiving their results  - 1,029 pupils have completed courses in education and childcare; design, surveying and planning; and digital production. 92% of students achieved a pass or above - and 370, or 71%, of those who applied for a university course have so far been successful. The Institute for Apprenticeships and Technical Education says others have already secured an apprenticeship or a job.

Exams board OCR has also apologised to students still waiting for their Cambridge Technicals (C-Tec) grades - the OCR equivalents of BTecs. Dad David Callow told us his daughter had received her A-level results - but her university place studying paramedic science won't be confirmed until she gets her C-Tec results in health and social care. ""She's desperately wanted to be a paramedic for years, she's really been throwing herself into it, and now she's sat here with the exam board failing to do the basics,"" he said. ""She's got friends out celebrating, knowing that they're definitely going to university, and she doesn't."" He said they were also worried that more and more clearing courses are being taken up ""by the hour"" as the wait continues. An OCR spokesperson said: âWhile most results were delivered on time, we are sorry for a
delay in issuing Cambridge Technicals for some students."" ""In these exceptional
cases, we are working with schools and colleges to deliver results as soon as
possible and to keep Ucas informed where results are needed for university
offers. We will provide regular updates to those affected,"" they added. Hazel ShearingEducation correspondent As we reported, 58% of private school candidates in England got A* and A grades at A-level, compared with 30.7% of comprehensive school pupils. Fee-paying schools did particularly well last year when teachers' assessments were used for A-level grades. Some 70.4% of private school pupils got the top two grades, compared with just 39.4% of comprehensive schools.  While this year's percentage-point gap is narrower, it's still significant. And it matters because those pupils with top grades will be the ones competing for courses at the most academically selective universities. Not all pupils got the same help when schools closed during lockdowns and they had to learn remotely â which disrupted Year 11 and Year 12 for pupils getting their results today. Some schools were better able to provide laptops to pupils for remote learning. Their pupils may have had more access to computers and to the internet at home, or more physical space in which to learn. It was not the same story for everyone. Lady Louise was pictured at the Commonwealth Games earlier this month A-level results day is an anxious occasion, whoever you are. One of those who got her grades today was the Queen's granddaughter, Lady Louise Windsor. Buckingham Palace didn't reveal what her results were but says she'll now attend the University of St Andrews to study English. It's one of the country's top universities, with standard entry grades set at AAA and minimum entry grades of ABB for the English MA. Lady Louise will follow in the footsteps of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, who met at the university in Fife, Scotland, when Kate was studying history of art and William was reading geography. As we've been reporting, hundreds of thousands of students have been receiving their A-level results today. They all sat their exams this summer for the first time since the coronavirus outbreak. Education Secretary James Cleverly has paid tribute to the ""resilience and hard work"" shown by students who ""experienced unprecedented disruption over the last couple of years"".

Telford College students Jag, Poppy and Kyra with their friend Abi Taras (second from right) Poppy Akiti from Telford College in Shropshire got triple distinctions in their BTecs this morning. They are going to Birmingham City
University to study law with the dream of becoming a civil rights solicitor. ""Family
life and background made me want to take it as a career path,"" Poppy said. ""I have seen
people be treated not nicely, so I'd rather help people who are having this
treatment and hopefully make everyone proud - including my teachers."" Jag Uppal, meanwhile, got a
distinction and two merits - the grades he needed to get into Birmingham
City University to study cyber security. ""I'm pretty over the moon to be
honest,"" he said. ""I was not expecting this at all. I don't know how I've done
this [but] I've managed to pull it out the bag."" If you're wondering how many people got their first choice university place this year, here are some figures from Ucas, the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service:  This shows a reduction in the number of students getting their first choice of university this year compared with last year, but an increase of 1.1 percentage points when compared with 2019 - the last time pupils sat exams. Some students who were expecting their BTec results today are still nervously waiting for their grades after a delay in results coming in. One mum of twin girls in Tameside, Greater Manchester, told the BBC there were a number of missing BTec results at her daughters' college. Qualifications board Pearson confirmed there had been issues, but said the delayed results accounted for only a ""very small percentage"" of the grades being awarded today. But the Tameside mum told the BBC her daughters were ""stressed"" not knowing whether they have their places at Huddersfield University or not. ""They didnât
get to do GCSEs because of Covid, didnât get to have a prom. Now this, itâs a
joke,"" she said. A spokesperson for Pearson said they were aware that ""a very small percentage of BTec students are experiencing a delay in receiving their results"". ""BTecs are a modular qualification and in order for us to award an overall grade, we require unit grades to be provided for each module studied. Where unit information is missing, we are working closely with schools and colleges to resolve this and provide any outstanding results as soon as we can,"" the spokesperson added. Navtej JohalBBC News Midlands correspondent It's the busiest day of the year here at Ucas headquarters
in Cheltenham. The people behind me have been on the phone since about 08:00. Theyâve been dealing with enquiries from loads of students - loads
of people concerned about what to do next. There are 270 staff here dealing with enquiries from roughly 20,000
people. It's the day they trained for, the day they look forward to. One member of staff described it to me earlier as their
Christmas Day. The advice coming from them time and time again is to remain
optimistic, whatever's happened. Remain flexible. There are 27,000 courses available via clearing. If you didnât get the results youâve wanted, or if you've done
better than you expected, there are lots of options there for you. Ellie CleverleyNewsbeat Reporter You've opened the envelope or email containing your A-level, BTec or T-level results and they're not what you expected. Don't panic -there are things you can do next. 1. Double check It's always worth double checking with your university if you can still attend, despite not getting the grades you needed. 2. Clearing If you applied for university but just missed the mark, some universities may still have a place for you thanks to clearing. So, if you still want to go to university, visit the Ucas website to see the universities that have available places. Find a university you like? As soon as you can, phone the admissions contact number for the university which you applied for. Tell them the grades you got and see if they will allow you to enrol as a student. 3. Appealing or re-sitting If clearing doesn't work out and you think your grades are incorrect, you could potentially appeal your exam results and pay to have your papers remarked. This needs to be done as soon as possible so don't wait around! Â© 2025 BBC.

"Top A-level grades have risen for students across England, Wales and Northern Ireland for the first time since 2021. Overall this year 28% of all grades were A* or A - up from 27.2% in 2023. However the figures vary between the three nations, rising in England but falling in Wales and Northern Ireland. Here is what you need to know about everything from grade boundaries to clearing. You can normally pick up AS and A-level results in person anytime from 08:00 BST. However, some students receive their results via email. Check with your school or college about the arrangements in place for you. How much does uni cost and does it boost earnings? Everything you need to know about student loans Surprised by your results? Our interactive guide on what to do next Each exam is graded on a scale from A* to E. Grade boundaries show the minimum number of marks you need for each grade. They are decided by examiners and published on results day. Qualifications Wales, which oversees Welsh exams, had been prepared to use statistics to set the grade boundaries to prevent marks dropping significantly below 2019 levels, because of a concern that performance in some subjects had still not recovered fully since the pandemic. That back-up plan was not needed. In England and Northern Ireland the way boundaries are decided has returned to normal. Ucas is a charity which runs a clearing process,externalmatching students with university and college courses which still have spaces. Students can use it if they: fail to achieve the grades for their conditional offer fail to receive any offers they want to accept decide after 30 June to apply for university achieve better grades than expected and want to change universities Clearing is now open and closes on 21 October. Universities make an offer to a student to join a course based on qualifications and grades or theUcas tariff points system,external. Each A-level grade is worth a certain number of Ucas points. For example, an A* is worth 56 points and a D is worth 24 points. Many students decide not to go to university and start an apprenticeship or go straight into work. Others take agap year,externalso they have more time to decide what to do next. What are apprenticeships and how do I choose a good one? If you do not think your grade is right, you should talk to your school or college. It will contact the exam board on your behalf and ask for your marks to be reviewed. If you still think you have been unfairly graded after a review,you can ask your school or college to appeal,external. The exam board will consider whether a correction is needed. If you are still not satisfied, you can request a review from the exams regulator Ofqual. The charity YoungMinds points out thatexam results are not the only measure of success,external- and if things do not turn out how you had hoped, there are lots of ways to get where you want to. If you only just miss out on the grades you need to get on to a university or college course, the admissions office might accept you anyway or offer you a place on a different course. You could also try clearing. It may also be possible to resit some or all of your exams. Talk to your school or college if you want to explore this route. Resits will take place in May or June 2025.

"Tuition fees in England and Wales will rise next year, after universities called for help with their finances. What are the changes and does getting a degree pay for itself through higher future earnings? The annual cost of an undergraduate degree in England and Wales will go up from Â£9,250 to Â£9,535 in the 2025/26 academic year. The changes will apply from 1 August 2025. Undergraduate students will also be able to borrow more for day-to-day living costs. The maximum maintenance loan for students from England, who live away from their parents outside of London, for example, will increase from Â£10,227 to Â£10,544 a year. The rise was first announced in England, where the government said the increases to tuition fees and maintenance loans were in line with inflation. The Welsh government then said it would bring fees in line with England. University tuition fees set to rise in England Welsh tuition fees to rise by nearly Â£300 a year Everything you need to know about student loans Warnings have been mounting about the state of university finances. The regulator in England, the Office for Students, warned that 40% of universities have predicted a deficit in this academic year. Inflation means tuition fees are worth less than they used to be, and there have been fewer international students to make up the financial shortfall. Students have been warned they could see cuts to staffing and courses as a result. Universities UK, which represents 141 universities,suggested in September that funding per student would have to be Â£12,500to meet universities' tuition costs - although it stressed it would not call for the tuition fee cap to be set that high. Announcing the tuition fee rise in England, Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson said there were ""severe financial challenges"" in higher education: ""With tuition fees frozen, universities have suffered real terms-decline in income."" However, the government has also said universities should ""manage their budgets"". UK nations set their own fees. In Northern Ireland, the maximum annual cost of an undergraduate degree is  Â£4,750 for Northern Irish students or Â£9,250 for other UK students. In Scotland, undergraduate tuition is free for the majority of Scottish students and Â£9,250 for other UK students. Student rents have risen sharply in recent years,according to data from 10 university towns and cities.,external Average annual rent rose from Â£6,520 in 2021-22 to Â£7,475 in 2023-24, according to research by the Higher Education Policy Institute (Hepi) and housing charity Unipol. The figures do not include London and Edinburgh. Student rents were particularly high in some cities like Bristol and Nottingham, where the average cost was Â£9,200 and Â£8,427 respectively. Hepi warned that maintenance loans in England only just cover average rent, and without family support or part-time work, students ""will have no money to live off"" after paying housing costs. If you are leaving home to study, it is generally cheaper to live in university-owned accommodation. In 2021-22(the latest UK-wide figures available),externalaverage rent for university owned rooms ranged from Â£6,471 in England to Â£4,565 in Northern Ireland. 'I got into uni but had nowhere to live' Students also need to budget for other big expenses, such as food, transport, course materials and going out. Research by the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service (Ucas), based on a survey of about 500 respondents, suggests thatstudents spent Â£219 per week on average in late 2022.,external In June 2023,Hepi said that more than half of students had a job. Most UK students are eligible for a tuition fee loan. Maintenance loans are also available for living costs. These are means-tested, so the amount you get depends on your family's income. The maximum maintenance loan if you live away from home and outside London ranges from Â£10,227 in England (before next year's increase) to Â£6,776 in Northern Ireland. You are charged interest on your total loan from the day you take it out. Eligibility and repayment rules differ across the UK. Loan repayment rules changed in England in 2023, meaning students are likely to pay back more, over a longer period of time, than those who went to university earlier. The government says new students ""will not repay more than they originally borrowed over the lifetime of their loans, when adjusted for inflation"". But MoneySavingExpert.com's Martin Lewis said extending the repayment periodwould increase ""costs by thousands"" for lower and mid-earners.,external Gov.uk - student finance calculator,external Everything you need to know about student loans Eligible students in Wales and Northern Ireland can claim maintenance grants which do not have to be repaid. Full-time undergraduates normally resident in Wales areentitled to at least Â£1,000.,externalStudents from the poorest backgrounds who study in London can get up to Â£10,124. In Northern Irelandthe maximum grant is Â£3,475.,external The Scottish government offersfinancial support to certain categories of students,,externalsuch as those with dependants. Across the UK, students in financial difficulty can apply for hardship funding and they may also be entitled tofinancial assistance from charities.,external Most students will leave university owing money. The Student Loans Company says graduates in England leave university with average debts of Â£48,470. In general, most graduates can expect to earn more than non-graduates,according to the Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA).,external However, it suggests the amount of extra money earned after a university education has declined. According to HESA's survey of 2020-21 graduates, the average salary reported 15 monthsafter gaining a degree was Â£29,699.,external Earnings also depend on the subject studied and university attended. Research by the IFS think tank,externalin England suggests, on average, women who studied creative arts and languages degrees earned the same amount in their lifetime as if they had not gone to university. Women who studied law, economics or medicine earned over Â£250,000 more during their career than if they had not got a degree. Men who studied creative arts on average earned less across their lifetimes than if they had not attended university. Male medicine or economics graduates earned Â£500,000 more. Attending university can help students from poorer backgrounds earn more than their parents might have done, according toresearch by education charity the Sutton Trust,externalin England. But only a fifth of graduates who were eligible for free school meals went on to be in the top 20% of earners - compared toalmost half of graduates who attended private schools.,external The Sutton Trust says attending a selective university, like a Russell Group one, gives young people the ""best chance of being socially mobile"".

Nearly two-thirds of London homicide victims in 2022 have been stabbed to death. Four people have been fatally shot - all within the last month. Sixty-two cases have led to arrests, and 52 cases have seen someone charged with murder. At the scene:BBC London's Aurelia Foster An army of TV crews, satellite trucks and journalists have set up camp in this ordinary residential road in Greenford. A forensics tent remains standing ominously within the large police cordon - marking the very spot Thomas O'Halloran died. Traffic on the eastbound A40, which is parallel to Runnymede Gardens, has been slowing down while drivers and passengers take in the crime scene. This is a narrow road, meaning this happened in plain view immediately outside people's homes, as well as afternoon traffic. It's difficult to understand how something like this could have happened in a spot so exposed. Neighbours say this is a quiet, uneventful area, with a large number of elderly residents. They told me that they fear becoming victims of crime themselves. Frasley Coutinho, who lives opposite where Mr O'Halloran was stabbed, said he saw the pensioner being surrounded by a group of youths. He said: ""I saw a couple of people gathering around him and then he drove past and stopped further up, and then there was a group of young boys around him."" Mr Coutinho said he caught some of the incident on a CCTV camera but it had been obscured by a plant. Nick Lambie told BBC London the community is very worried by the fatal stabbing Another resident Nick Lambie said Mr O'Halloran was known to collect for charity. He added: ""When you hear something like that happening on your doorstep it is very disconcerting as it is a very quiet area. ""I understand he collected for charity and was quite often at the local Tesco. By the looks of it he was making his way from there. ""Someone in their 80s in a mobility scooter can't put up much of a fight.""

"Peter Coshan was last seen in Edinburgh on 11 August Detectives are treating the disappearance of a former teacher at Edinburgh's Fettes College as murder. Dr Peter Coshan, 75, was last seen in the Seafield Road area of Edinburgh at about 23:50 on 11 August and was reported missing the next day. Two men, aged 27 and 63, have been arrested and charged. Mr Coshan, who taught biology at former prime minister Tony Blair's old school, is presumed dead but his body has not been found. The arrested men are due to appear at Edinburgh Sheriff Court on Thursday. Fettes College said it was ""shocked and deeply saddened"" to hear of the disappearance. Mr Coshan was a member of the teaching staff from 1972 until his retirement in 2005.  He joined a year after Tony Blair attended the school, from 1966 to 1971. Helen Harrison, head of Fettes College, said: ""Peter was an inspirational biology teacher and he will be remembered fondly by many. ""Not least by those who were taught by him, tutored by him and introduced to the hills through his enthusiasm for the Duke of Edinburgh Award Scheme, which he ran for 33 years."" Detectives areappealing to the public for information.,external Det Supt Andrew Patrick said extensive inquiries were ongoing to trace Mr Coshan, whose home in Stockbridge is four miles from where he was last seen. He added: ""I would encourage anyone with any information regarding Peter's disappearance to contact police as a matter of urgency.

"Mick Lynch, boss of the RMT union which is leading today's train strike, says action by his union will continue ""until we reach a settlement"" Network Rail's boss says the ongoing dispute over pay, jobs and conditions can be unlocked by putting a proposed deal to union members Today, passengers are being told only to travel by train if necessary - just 20% of services running Some places will have no services, and where they are operating, trains will only run between 07:30 and 18:30 BST Meanwhile, the government says the unions are ""hell-bent on causing misery"" for travellers Strike action is also planned for Saturday, as well as walkouts on the London Underground and London Overground on Friday Edited by Nathan Williams We'll be closing this page shortly. Many thanks for following along
throughout the day. Today's coverage was
brought to you by Nathan Williams, Heather Sharp, George Wright and Oliver
Slow. As we near the end of today's coverage of the train strikes, here's a
recap of the main developments: Katy AustinTransport correspondent The
overall picture is that about 20 percent of usual train services are able to run
today, and they will finish earlier than normal. Some people can now work from home who would normally commute but it's not an
option for everybody, and a lot of leisure plans are being disrupted. So are we any closure to a resolution in these ongoing disputes? Well the tone
of interviews by key players this morning was very much one of frustration, and the
sense that not very much progress has been made towards agreements. Network Rail does want the RMT union to put an offer that it rejected last
month to its members to have their say. But generally union leaders are still saying
they will push for a pay rise that reflects the increased cost of living, and
they say job security and conditions need protecting. Although no national strikes will take place on Friday, travellers could
feel some leftover effects from today, particularly in the morning. Travel in London, however, is set to be highly disrupted, with strikes
affecting much of the underground, overground and bus networks. Transport for
London (TfL) advises against all tube travel, and only on the rest of the
network ""if essential"". ""If you need to travel, river services, London Cable Car and Santander
Cycles will be available to help you get around,"" TfL says. Here's how things are looking in the capital on Friday: Katy AustinTransport correspondent Charley
and Andy have Andy's mum to thank if they make their flight to Turkey from
Gatwick Airport today. She alerted them to the fact today's strike coincided with the start of their
holiday to Bodrum, on the Aegean Sea, which theyâd been planning for two years. They arrived with four boys in tow at Norwich Station 90 minutes before they
originally planned, but they're still among the lucky ones. They originally looked into getting a car down to Gatwick â a distance of about
150 miles (240km) â but that would have cost them an extra Â£300. So they came to
the station several days ago and spoke to staff, who explained that even though
there would be a limited service due to the strike action, it would still be
possible to get to the airport. Standing outside
Liverpool Lime Street station this morning, striking rail workers expressed
sadness about the need to resort to industrial action to try and secure a pay rise. ""We're in a cost of living crisis, and weâre being told to show restraint in
our pay claims, but the people who arenât showing restraint are the energy
companies,"" Gary Kilroy, Merseyside branch general secretary of the Transport
Salaried Staffsâ Association (TSSA), told the BBC. Kilroy continued:  The only people being asked to show restraint are working people, and weâre out here to say thatâs not fair and we need to keep our pay up with the cost of living so we can afford to pay the bills.""  Liverpool Street services were reduced to two departures per hour due to the strikes. Staff from the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers (RMT) were also on the picket line. RMT's Darren Pilling thanked the public for their support, saying there was a ""vacuum"" at the top of the government. He added: It's very sad we're out here again""  With just 20% of
services running, today's strikes are likely to cause widespread disruption for people attending events - here are just a few examples. In London this includes West Hamâs Europa Conference League qualifying tie
against Danish side Viborg FF, which is due to kick off at 19:45 BST at London
Stadium in Stratford. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Emmanuel Moine is the general manager of the Glen Mhor Hotel in Inverness. He told BBC Scotland how hotels across the Highlands have had cancellations as a result of the train strikes. He said: ""We have had some cancellations and the hotel is 60 or 70% full when we should be fully booked. ""We are in August so obviously it has an impact on the tourism."" Moine is also the chairman of the Highland Hotels Association which represents 20 chain and independently-operated hotels. He said other hoteliers have noticed similar downturns in business. ""I've been speaking to every hotelier in Inverness and we have the same problem. ""We had a great tourist season, but we do our best to correct the problem and it's not helping. You can read more about the impact on rail services in Scotlandhere. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has said that the median salary for the rail sector is Â£44,000. But is it? The BBC has looked into this, and it depends who you include. These are the Office of National Statistics' median salary figures for five different categories of workers: The ONS have calculated a median figure of Â£43,747 across these five categories. However, if train drivers are not included - and they have not been involved in the RMT strikes - the ONS figure is Â£36,800. However, the RMT says 10,000 of its members are cleaners, who are lower paid. It says that if you take the Â£44,000 figure, exclude the drivers and include cleaning staff you get a median figure of Â£33,000. As we've been reporting, Transport Minister Grant Shapps has had some strong words for the strikers, saying the unions are ""hell-bent on causing as much misery as possible to the very same taxpayers who stumped up Â£600 per household to ensure not a single rail worker lost their job during the pandemic"". He also wrote in the Daily Mail yesterday, setting out a plan to tackle ""Luddite trade unions"". It included changes to the rules on taking industrial action, such as setting minimum service levels during strikes, and requiring more ballots of union members. This prompted ire from Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner. ""Instead of doing their jobs, Tory ministers are dreaming up reckless anti-union laws that would inflame disputes, risk passenger safety, and weaken employment rights,"" she said. ""Shapps could resolve this strike with a one-point plan: him getting around the table and doing his job."" The government has said it will not bring in major policy initiatives until the new leader is in place in September, but it did pass legislation earlier in the summer to allow businesses to use agency workers to fill in for striking staff.

OnFriday, an RMT strike will affect both the London
Underground and London Overground in separate disputes over pensions and pay. Transport
for London(TfL) says people should avoid the Tube, which will have little or no
services running, and only use the rest of the network if essential. Some bus services will also be affected as drivers take part in a strike
called by the Unite union. TfL has published alist of the routes,externallikely to be
affected. OnSaturday,the RMT and TSSA will go on strike again.
The effect on services is expected to be the same as today, although some
services will run on one of the days but not the other. Disruption is likely to
continue into Sunday morning. Unite's London bus
strike will also continue for a second day. Looking beyond this week, RMT leader Mick Lynch said his union will continue with strikes ""until we reach a settlement"" with Network Rail and other operators. Or need a recap? Here are the latest developments as the UK faces another day of rail strikes: A loans company in Wolverhampton has had to shut for a
day after todayâs rail strike meant staff could not reach the office. Street UK, an alternative
credit provider, will be closed Thursday, says chief executive Julia Herdman.
Itâs the second time railway strikes led to the closure of one of its branches. ""We don't have a lot of staff, so sometimes we
have to make these difficult decisions,"" she tells BBC Radio WM. ""It could potentially mean that someone who is in
need of our help can't get our help."" West Midlands Trains is running a reduced timetable on Thursday and Saturday,
while services are expected to be ""significantly disrupted"" on Friday. With
many workers likely to remain at home today because of the nationwide rail strikes,
internet providers are expecting a boost in usage. Tony Hughes of broadband provider 4th Utility says his firm expects
internet traffic to increase by up to 15 percent today - ""a really significant uplift"". ""We'll see millions more people abandoning their commutes and working from studies,
kitchens and spare bedrooms,"" he said, adding that Covid had ensured companies
were prepared for the increased demand. This video can not be played The people of Plymouth have been giving their opinions on the strikes. More now from RMT leader Mick Lynch. He told Sky News that action
by his union will continue ""until we reach a settlement"" with Network
Rail and other operators. He's also warned that the UK
could be brought by a standstill by a wave of strikes hitting ""every
sector of the economy"". He stopped short of predicting a general strike, saying that it
was down to Trades Union Congress to make that decision. But he added: ""What you are going to get is a wave of
solidarity action, generalised strike action, synchronised action. ""And you'll see it in every sector of the economy, in education,
in health, wider parts of the transport system, in all sectors, the private
sector as well. ""People are fed up with the way they've been treated. The
British worker is basically underpaid and gets no dignity or respect in the
workplace."" The opposition has said the rail strike impasse can
be best resolved by the two sides coming together to reach a fair outcome for
all. Speaking to TalkTV this week, shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said the way to
support striking workers ""doesnât involve going on picket lines"". Instead, she
said Labour should work to ""bring the parties together to get an outcome that
is fair to those people who work in the rail sector and elsewhere"". Keir Starmer, who has attracted criticism from some corners of his party for
his stance on the issue, told ITV ""you canât be in government around the cabinet
table and then go to a picket line"". Last month Starmer removed from his front bench a junior shadow transport
minister, Sam Tarry, who joined striking rail workers on a picket line. At the time, the opposition leader said he wanted to turn
Labour ""from a party of protest into a party that can win power â then hand
that power to working people"". In 2020, almost 40 percent of rail journeys in
England were for commuting, and more than a quarter were for leisure. Although the numbers that year were skewed by Covid, just 4
percent of train trips were for business. 
A year earlier - pre-pandemic - almost half of rail journeys were for
commuting. Katy AustinTransport correspondent I'm at Norwich station today. There are some trains departing but this is a dispute affecting the
whole country and - like a lot of other places - the trains started later than
normal. We spoke to some people who turned up here and forgot the strike was
happening. The reason it's so disruptive on a national scale is that the RMT
workers on strike include some from Network Rail who control the signals. That means even if the train company in your area isn't involved in the
dispute you just canât run the number of trains you would do normally if you
havenât got signalling staff. This dispute feels
fairly intractable at the moment. This video can not be played RMT members should vote on proposed deal - Rail chief We've
had more reaction from Network Rail Chief Executive Andrew Haines. He says his company has put forward a deal amounting to an 8% pay rise over two years, but that it hasn't been put to staff. The RMT have refused to put that to a referendum, and that's the problem because if they had the chance to vote on that, we believe they'd accept it. When we put a similar deal to a different union that got a very strong endorsement.  That's the way to unlock this, thatâs the way to get rid of this huge frustration for passengers today.""  He also defended his large salary in comparison to striking workers. ""People are not going on strike over what I'm earning,"" he said. ""They believe they want a decent pay rise, they want protection, they want job security, and we've offered that."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Train passengers have been facing more disruption, with only 20% of services running on Thursday due to strikes. Half of Britain's lines are closed as more than 45,000 rail workers walk out in a row over pay, jobs and conditions. Some routes have no services, and where they are operating, trains will only run between 07:30 and 18:30 BST. Another strike is scheduled for Saturday. Passengers are being told only to travel by train if necessary. It is the latest in a series of summer strikes and will alter the travel plans for workers, festival-goers and those heading to the cricket Test match at Lord's in London. Mick Lynch, general secretary of the Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union has warned that the dispute could go on ""indefinitely"" unless a pay settlement is reached. In a letter to the transport secretary, he accused the government of using taxpayers' money to ""bail out"" private train companies, helping them to avoid being liable for revenue lost due to strike action. ""The same companies comply with government instructions to hold down pay, cut thousands of safety critical rail jobs, introduce driver-only trains and close ticket offices across the network"", Mr Lynch added. A spokesperson for the Department for Transport said: ""Yet again, for the sixth time since June, union leaders are opting to inflict misery and disrupt the day-to-day lives of millions instead of working with industry to agree a deal that will bring our railways into the 21st century."" When are the train and Tube strikes? How much are rail workers paid? Strikes to disrupt almost all ScotRail services A total of 4,300 services are expected to run across the country on Thursday and Saturday, according to track operator Network Rail. This is the highest number yet during the series of national RMT strikes. However, it is still only just over a fifth of usual service levels. Some places, including Portsmouth, Swansea and Blackpool, will have no trains at all and there will be no services running north of Falkirk. Services will also finish earlier. The last train from London to Edinburgh on Thursday, for example, left at 14:00, while the last train to Leeds left at 15:05. Trains will also start later than usual on the days following strikes. The involvement of Network Rail signal workers across England, Wales and Scotland makes the RMT strike particularly disruptive. RMT general secretary Mick Lynch joined a picket line outside London's Euston station It is not possible to run trains without signallers, and only a fraction can run with the available contingency staffing. Network Rail owns and manages most of the UK's rail infrastructure. If customers are not able to travel on Thursday or Saturday, the Rail Delivery Group - which represents operators - said they can use these tickets either the day before or up to and including 23 August. Otherwise customers will be able to change the ticket or claim a refund. Thursday's strikes involve members of the RMT at 14 train operators, TSSA (Transport Salaried Staffs' Association) members at seven companies and Unite members at Network Rail. Network Rail's chief executive Andrew Haines described negotiations with unions as ""slow"" and ""painful"" and said there was ""an absolute lack of clarity over what it would take for this strike to be called off"". Luke Chester, organising director at the TSSA, said: ""The reality is that what we need to resolve this dispute is a pay rise which reflects the cost of living increase that is affecting most people in this country very severely."" Meanwhile, on Friday both the London Underground and Overground will be affected by RMT strike action, in a separate dispute over pensions and pay. Transport for London said people should avoid the Tube, which will have little or no services running, and only use the rest of the network if essential. It advised bus services may also be affected as drivers take part in a strike called by Unite the union. Today is the start of four days of reduced services in a row, because strike day disruption spills over into later-starting trains the next day. The rail industry says these national scale strikes cost them up to Â£30m a day. And three weeks on from the previous national scale RMT strike, resolutions to the ongoing disputes over pay and conditions don't appear much closer. One cohort of managers who are in the TSSA have come to a pay agreement with Network Rail - but other groups in the union haven't reached deals with their employers. Last month, the RMT rejected Network's Rail's latest pay offer despite their insistence that the union should put it to their members first. Talks since then haven't produced an agreement to prevent these latest walkouts going ahead. When it comes to the train companies, even less progress has been made. Unions have repeatedly accused the government of not enabling effective negotiations, but the transport secretary has insisted only employers and unions can settle their disputes. Lucy Westwood has spent Â£100 extra to book a hotel for a theatre trip Lucy Westwood has spent an extra Â£100 on a hotel and petrol to be able to take her children to the theatre on Thursday. Her original plan had been to get the train from Lichfield to London to see Back to the Future. She had bought theatre tickets for the August ""Kids Week"" where children get cheaper tickets. ""I'd got a day family return - all sorted and planned but then heard about the strikes,"" Lucy said. She was unable get a refund from the theatre and was offered to swap her tickets but could not afford to pay the difference for a more expensive date. ""It's made things a lot more difficult, I was stuck with tickets I couldn't get a refund for and two very disappointed kids,"" she said. ""It's the highlight of our week but its costing me a lot more than it would have to get the train which is really frustrating.""

"The US has announced that they will begin formal trade negotiations with Taiwan, weeks after a controversial visit by US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. The first round of talks is expected to begin in ""early fall"", said the Office of US Trade Representative. Their discussion will include talks on trade facilitation, digital trade and anti-corruption standards. Relations between the US and China have been increasingly tense following Ms Pelosi's visit. The US-Taiwan Initiative on 21st Century Trade was first unveiled in June, with both sides now saying they had ""reached consensus on the negotiating mandate"". ""We plan to pursue an ambitious schedule.... that will help build a fairer, more prosperous and resilient 21st century economy,""said Deputy United States Trade Representative Sarah Bianchi in a statement.,external Trade between the US and Taiwan was worth nearly $106bn (Â£88bn) in 2020. The announcement comes as China launched its largest-ever military exercises around Taiwan after Ms Pelosi's visit earlier in August. Under the ""One China policy"", the US recognises and has formal ties with China rather than the island of Taiwan but maintains a ""robust unofficial"" relationship with Taiwan, including continued arms sales to the island so that it can defend itself. Beijing sees the self-governing island as its own, renegade territory that must be united with the mainland. However, Taiwan is a self-ruled island that sees itself as distinct from the mainland. Seperately on Thursday, top US diplomat for East Asia Daniel Kritenbrink said Beijing's ""growing coercion....threatens the peace and stability of the Taiwan Strait"". ""We will continue to take calm, but resolute steps to uphold peace and stability in the face of Beijing's ongoing efforts to undermine it and to support Taiwan in line with our long-standing policy,"" he said. Why do China and Taiwan have poor relations?China sees the self-ruled island as a part of its territory and insists it should be unified with the mainland, by force if necessary How is Taiwan governed?The island has its own constitution, democratically elected leaders, and about 300,000 active troops in its armed forces Who recognises Taiwan?Only a few countries recognise Taiwan.

Grade boundaries show the minimum number of marks you need for each grade. They are decided by examiners and published on results day. Qualifications Wales, which oversees Welsh exams, had been prepared to use statistics to set the grade boundaries to prevent marks dropping significantly below 2019 levels, because of a concern that performance in some subjects had still not recovered fully since the pandemic. That back-up plan was not needed. In England and Northern Ireland the way boundaries are decided has returned to normal. Ucas is a charity which runs a clearing process,externalmatching students with university and college courses which still have spaces. Students can use it if they: fail to achieve the grades for their conditional offer fail to receive any offers they want to accept decide after 30 June to apply for university achieve better grades than expected and want to change universities Clearing is now open and closes on 21 October. Universities make an offer to a student to join a course based on qualifications and grades or theUcas tariff points system,external. Each A-level grade is worth a certain number of Ucas points. For example, an A* is worth 56 points and a D is worth 24 points. Many students decide not to go to university and start an apprenticeship or go straight into work. Others take agap year,externalso they have more time to decide what to do next. What are apprenticeships and how do I choose a good one? If you do not think your grade is right, you should talk to your school or college. It will contact the exam board on your behalf and ask for your marks to be reviewed. If you still think you have been unfairly graded after a review,you can ask your school or college to appeal,external. The exam board will consider whether a correction is needed. If you are still not satisfied, you can request a review from the exams regulator Ofqual. The charity YoungMinds points out thatexam results are not the only measure of success,external- and if things do not turn out how you had hoped, there are lots of ways to get where you want to. If you only just miss out on the grades you need to get on to a university or college course, the admissions office might accept you anyway or offer you a place on a different course. You could also try clearing. It may also be possible to resit some or all of your exams. Talk to your school or college if you want to explore this route. Resits will take place in May or June 2025.

"Japan's young adults are a sober bunch - something authorities are hoping to change with a new campaign. The younger generation drinks less alcohol than their parents - a move that has hit taxes from beverages like sake (rice wine). So the national tax agency has stepped in with a national competition to come up with ideas to reverse the trend. The ""Sake Viva!"" campaign hopes to come up with a plan to make drinking more attractive - and boost the industry. The contest asks 20 to 39-year-olds to share their business ideas to kick-start demand among their peers - whether it's for Japanese sake, shochu, whisky, beer or wine. The group running the competition for the tax authority says new habits - partly formed during the Covid pandemic - and an ageing population have led to a decline in alcohol sales. It wants contestants to come up with promotions, branding, and even cutting-edge plans involving artificial intelligence. Japanese media say the reaction has been mixed, with some criticism about the bid to promote an unhealthy habit. But others have posted quirky ideas online - such as famous actresses ""performing"" as virtual-reality hostesses in digital clubs. Contestants have until the end of September to put forward their ideas. The best plans will then be developed with help from experts before the final proposals are presented in November. Thecampaign's website,externalsays Japan's alcohol market is shrinking and the country's older demographic - alongside declining birth rates - is a significant factor behind it. Recent figures from the tax agency show that people were drinking less in 2020 than in 1995, with numbers plummeting from an annual average of 100 litres (22 gallons) to 75 litres (16 gallons) per adult. Tax revenue from taxes on alcohol has also shrunk over the years. According to The Japan Times newspaper, it made up 5% of total revenue in 1980, but in 2020 amounts to just 1.7%. The World Bank estimates that nearly a third (29%) of Japan's population is aged 65 and older - the highest proportion in the world. Concerns about the future of sake is not the only problem that poses for Japan's economy - there are worries about thesupply of younger staff for certain types of jobs, andcare for the elderlyin the future.

"Some victims were buried on the outskirts of the city A huge explosion has ripped through a crowded mosque in the Afghan capital Kabul, killing 21 people, police say. Another 33 people were injured, Kabul police spokesman Khalid Zadran added. Wednesday's blast occurred during evening prayers. The mosque's imam Amir Muhammad Kabuli is reported to be among the dead. It is unclear who was behind the attack, a week after Islamic State (IS) militants killed a pro-Taliban cleric in a suicide bomb blast, also in Kabul. The Talibanâs secretive war against IS Security forces have now sealed off the blast scene in Kabul. Witnesses described hearing a powerful explosion which shattered windows in nearby buildings. ""I saw that so many people were killed, even people were thrown out of the windows of the mosque,"" one eyewitness told Reuters news agency. Stefano Sozza, the head of the medical charity Emergency, which runs the city's main hospital, told the BBC his group had already treated 35 people, including children. ""Our doctors... operated [on] the patients in need of surgical assistance all night long. The injuries were mainly related to the blast, so there were shells inside the bodies and burning injuries all over the bodies of the victims."" He said he believed the blast was inside the mosque. ""There was probably someone entering during the prayer time, so it was crowded at that moment and then [the attacker] activated this body burning improvised explosive device. ""So that all the persons that were close to the attacker were basically dead and the ones all around received several injuries,"" Mr Sozza said. News agency AP quoted Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid as saying that the ""perpetrators of such crimes will soon be brought to justice and will be punished"". But in a series of tweets, the UN mission in Afghanistan (Unama) urged the Taliban to take ""concrete steps"" to prevent terrorism and provide additional support to vulnerable communities. It said the attack was ""the latest in a disturbing series of bombings,externalwhich have killed & injured more than 250 people in recent weeks, the highest monthly number of civilian casualties over the last year"". Senior Taliban officials are meeting more than 2,000 tribal and religious elders on Thursday in Afghanistan's second city Kandahar, the movement's main power base. A spokesman quoted by AFP news agency said ""important decisions"" would be taken at the major gathering. The Kabul bombing comes days after theassassination of prominent cleric and Taliban supporter Rahimullah Haqqaniin a suicide bombing. The Islamic State group said it carried out the attack on Mr Haqqani, one of the highest profile figures to be killed since the Taliban returned to power a year ago. The mosque was crowded, the bomb powerful, and another cleric seems to have been in the sights of Islamic State, the group which has emerged as the Taliban's most potent enemy. In the past month, three prominent religious leaders were targeted in Kabul and there were assassinations in other cities. Last week it was Sheikh Rahimullah Haqqani, known to be close to the Taliban. This time it's Amir Muhammad Kabuli, said to be an adherent of the more moderate Sufi faith. Video posted on social media showed a scene of carnage. One religious student who was just outside the mosque told the BBC he saw the bodies of the dead and injured sprawled inside, including children attending evening prayers. IS's signature has been its devastating attacks on the minority Shia Hazara community. But their focus now seems to be widening just as the Taliban celebrate their one year in power - a takeover which ended one chapter of a long bloody war but only ushered in yet another. These Islamist groups have long been split along ideological and religious lines, deepened by intense personal and political rivalries. The Taliban don't share IS's adherence to an austere Salafist creed, its global jihadi ambitions and the most savage of tactics; IS reviles the Taliban for its diplomatic engagement in recent years with the US and other Western powers.

"The rapid decline in the use of cash during the pandemic has eased as consumers return to their preferred method of paying for things, a report suggests. Many people were forced into trying alternative ways of spending owing to Covid restrictions, banking trade body UK Finance said. But it added that their preferred method had not changed radically. Cash use is still forecast to drop, accounting for 6% of payments by 2031. ""Rather than the UK becoming a cash-free society over the next decade, the UK will transition to an economy where cash is less important than it once was but remains valued and preferred by many,"" the report said. The trend of the last decade has been the significant rise in the prevalence of card - and particularly contactless - payments. Debit or credit cards were used in 57% of all payments in the UK last year. In comparison, the use of notes and coins has dropped from 55% of payments in 2011 to 15% last year. During the pandemic, the number of payments made in total fell. In particular, cash use slumped during lockdowns and as retailers encouraged friction-free payments. Now, the UK Finance report suggests that long-term trends will continue as if there has been no pandemic impact. While 42% of consumers only made one transaction or fewer in cash each month, Adrian Buckle, head of research at UK Finance, said that many people were returning to their first preference when paying. ""Payment trends generally tend to change slowly, as we all form habits about the way we pay for things and these don't change easily,"" he said. 'I've taught my mum some things about finance' Warning millions would struggle if cash phased out Natalie Ceeney, who leads work into access to cash, said: ""It's now widely recognised that those who rely on cash tend to be older, poorer or more vulnerable, many of whom simply can't 'go digital'. ""I'm really pleased that, after many years of campaigning on the issue, the industry is working hard to put in solutions and we should finally have legislation to protect access to cash in the next few months."" Another factor in the use of cash is the rising cost of living. Mr Buckle said cash became slightly more popular during the financial crisis at the start of the last decade but, like then, it had relatively little impact on the longer term decline. The Post Office recently reported that its counters handled Â£801m in personal cash withdrawals in July,the most since records began five years ago. It said customers' use of cash to budget and the popularity of staycations were behind the increase. In May, Salford University student Kira Hayward told the BBC that she turned to social media for inspiration to help her cope with rising costs by taking cash out of her bank account. Student Kira Hayward limits her spending by using ""budget binders"" for cash She puts it in different labelled envelopes to ensure she has money for food and bills. ""I went on Instagram and YouTube and I saw these physical budget binders,"" she said. ""I take the money out of the bank and I budget for things like my shopping. If I know I have Â£80 in my personal shopping for the month I know I can't go over that."" However, the UK Finance report suggested that young people were becoming adept at budgeting using smartphone apps and were keeping a keen eye on their bank balance digitally. Mr Buckle said they would log into accounts several times a day. Instead of using cash to budget, many would consider any cash withdrawals as money already ""spent"" as it had already reduced the bank balance they saw on the screen. The report also questioned the assumption that younger people were more reliant than others on Buy Now, Pay Later products. The trade body's limited research suggested about one in eight people had used these services, but they were most likely to be aged between 35 and 44.

"Train passengers have been facing more disruption, with only 20% of services running on Thursday due to strikes. Half of Britain's lines are closed as more than 45,000 rail workers walk out in a row over pay, jobs and conditions. Some routes have no services, and where they are operating, trains will only run between 07:30 and 18:30 BST. Another strike is scheduled for Saturday. Passengers are being told only to travel by train if necessary. It is the latest in a series of summer strikes and will alter the travel plans for workers, festival-goers and those heading to the cricket Test match at Lord's in London. Mick Lynch, general secretary of the Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union has warned that the dispute could go on ""indefinitely"" unless a pay settlement is reached. In a letter to the transport secretary, he accused the government of using taxpayers' money to ""bail out"" private train companies, helping them to avoid being liable for revenue lost due to strike action. ""The same companies comply with government instructions to hold down pay, cut thousands of safety critical rail jobs, introduce driver-only trains and close ticket offices across the network"", Mr Lynch added. A spokesperson for the Department for Transport said: ""Yet again, for the sixth time since June, union leaders are opting to inflict misery and disrupt the day-to-day lives of millions instead of working with industry to agree a deal that will bring our railways into the 21st century."" When are the train and Tube strikes? How much are rail workers paid? Strikes to disrupt almost all ScotRail services A total of 4,300 services are expected to run across the country on Thursday and Saturday, according to track operator Network Rail. This is the highest number yet during the series of national RMT strikes. However, it is still only just over a fifth of usual service levels. Some places, including Portsmouth, Swansea and Blackpool, will have no trains at all and there will be no services running north of Falkirk. Services will also finish earlier. The last train from London to Edinburgh on Thursday, for example, left at 14:00, while the last train to Leeds left at 15:05. Trains will also start later than usual on the days following strikes. The involvement of Network Rail signal workers across England, Wales and Scotland makes the RMT strike particularly disruptive. RMT general secretary Mick Lynch joined a picket line outside London's Euston station It is not possible to run trains without signallers, and only a fraction can run with the available contingency staffing. Network Rail owns and manages most of the UK's rail infrastructure. If customers are not able to travel on Thursday or Saturday, the Rail Delivery Group - which represents operators - said they can use these tickets either the day before or up to and including 23 August. Otherwise customers will be able to change the ticket or claim a refund. Thursday's strikes involve members of the RMT at 14 train operators, TSSA (Transport Salaried Staffs' Association) members at seven companies and Unite members at Network Rail. Network Rail's chief executive Andrew Haines described negotiations with unions as ""slow"" and ""painful"" and said there was ""an absolute lack of clarity over what it would take for this strike to be called off"". Luke Chester, organising director at the TSSA, said: ""The reality is that what we need to resolve this dispute is a pay rise which reflects the cost of living increase that is affecting most people in this country very severely."" Meanwhile, on Friday both the London Underground and Overground will be affected by RMT strike action, in a separate dispute over pensions and pay. Transport for London said people should avoid the Tube, which will have little or no services running, and only use the rest of the network if essential. It advised bus services may also be affected as drivers take part in a strike called by Unite the union. Today is the start of four days of reduced services in a row, because strike day disruption spills over into later-starting trains the next day. The rail industry says these national scale strikes cost them up to Â£30m a day. And three weeks on from the previous national scale RMT strike, resolutions to the ongoing disputes over pay and conditions don't appear much closer. One cohort of managers who are in the TSSA have come to a pay agreement with Network Rail - but other groups in the union haven't reached deals with their employers. Last month, the RMT rejected Network's Rail's latest pay offer despite their insistence that the union should put it to their members first. Talks since then haven't produced an agreement to prevent these latest walkouts going ahead. When it comes to the train companies, even less progress has been made. Unions have repeatedly accused the government of not enabling effective negotiations, but the transport secretary has insisted only employers and unions can settle their disputes. Lucy Westwood has spent Â£100 extra to book a hotel for a theatre trip Lucy Westwood has spent an extra Â£100 on a hotel and petrol to be able to take her children to the theatre on Thursday. Her original plan had been to get the train from Lichfield to London to see Back to the Future. She had bought theatre tickets for the August ""Kids Week"" where children get cheaper tickets. ""I'd got a day family return - all sorted and planned but then heard about the strikes,"" Lucy said. She was unable get a refund from the theatre and was offered to swap her tickets but could not afford to pay the difference for a more expensive date. ""It's made things a lot more difficult, I was stuck with tickets I couldn't get a refund for and two very disappointed kids,"" she said. ""It's the highlight of our week but its costing me a lot more than it would have to get the train which is really frustrating.""
