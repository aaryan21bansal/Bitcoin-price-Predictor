"The UK has recognised the abuses carried out against the Mau Mau during the Kenyan struggle for independence A group of more than 100,000 Kenyans from the Talai clan has written to Prince William to seek an apology, and his support for reparations for human rights abuses they say they suffered during the British colonial settlement. The letter, a copy of which the BBC has seen, says the British government has declined to engage with the clan's representatives and they're therefore reaching out to the prince ""because Kenya is special to him"". A request for comment has been sent to both the Royal Family and the British Foreign Office. The Talai say the British government has declined to recognise the suffering of its members during the colonial era. A UN inquiry determined last year that gross human rights violations were committed particularly against the clan, including unlawful killing, sexual violence, torture, and arbitrary detention and displacement. Five UN Special Rapporteurs then wrote to the British government regarding public apologies, reparations and remedy. In response, the UK said it had already issued a public apology and settlement in 2013 of claims made by Kenyans who lived through the emergency period and the Mau Mau insurgency, from 1952 to 1963 when Kenya gained independence. The Talai however insist that the case the British government referred to in its response is a separate case. Prince William has spoken of his fondness for Kenya ""Despite our immense suffering under British rule, the British Government has refused to acknowledge this fact or meet any of us, let alone apologise,"" the group says. So they've turned to Prince William for help because of his personal connection to the country. ""You proposed to your wife there and when your Grandmother became Queen, she was visiting Kenya - which at the time was one of the colonies."" ""We inherited the pain, you inherited the profit,"" reads their letter to the prince. ""Many of our group are very elderly so the urgency of this is paramount. We cannot let another victim of this time pass away still longing for their dignity to be restored."" Three representatives of the Talai clan are in London to argue their case The clan says its members were forcefully evicted from fertile land in the highlands of the Rift Valley to pave the way for tea plantations, some of which still exist and are owned by UK-based multinationals. The Talai held a leadership role among the Kipsigis ethnic group in Kenya and led the resistance against European settlement. To quash it, every member of the Talai clan was forcefully moved to detention in a tse-tse fly and mosquito infested valley near present day Lake Victoria. The conditions there are recorded to have been so harsh that many of them died and women suffered miscarriages. They also lost their livestock in large numbers. When Kenya gained independence in 1963, the survivors left detention and returned to what they considered their ancestral land. But they never recovered it. They say they've lived alongside the tea estates as squatters ever since. Three representatives of the clan, including the current Governor of Kericho where the Kipsigis live, are currently in London to meet MPs and civil society representatives to argue for their claim.

"This video can not be played Watch: EU ban on Russian oil will not be easy, says von der Leyen The EU has proposed some of its toughest measures yet against Russia, including a total ban on oil imports and sanctions on war crimes suspects. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the package was aimed at maximising pressure on Russia while minimising damage to Europe. Russian crude oil would be phased out within six months, she said. Hungary has rejected the proposal as unacceptable and the Czech and Slovak governments want a transition period. The EU has been focusing for weeks on how to wean itself off Russian oil and gas. It has already pledged to reduce gas imports by two-thirds by the end of 2022 and now plans to phase out crude oil over six months and refined products by the end of 2022. ""We will make sure that we phase out Russian oil in an orderly fashion,"" the Commission president said. The package first has to be approved by EU ambassadors and is set to be signed off in the next few days. But Hungarian government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs said his country would veto it in its current form: ""They exactly know that what they are proposing is against Hungarian interests... and if we do that we are completely going to ruin the Hungarian economy."" Slovakia as well as Hungary currently relies on Russian oil and under the initial proposal would be given until the end of 2023 to find alternative suppliers. Slovakia's economy minister said his country wanted a three-year transition period, while Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala said he would also seek a two-to-three year exemption to tackle problems with pipeline capacity. Last year, Russia supplied the EU with a quarter of its oil imports, and the Netherlands and Germany were the biggest buyers. The Dutch government has said it wants to halt all Russian fossil fuel imports by the end of this year and Germany has drastically reduced its reliance on Russian oil imports, down from 35% to 12%. The UK, which is no longer in the EU, is already phasing out Russian oil, which accounts for 8% of its imports. German Economics Minister Robert Habeck has said the six-month transition period gives Berlin long enough to make the change. The problem for Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic is that they are all landlocked and rely on their neighbours for fuel supplies. Czech special envoy for energy security Vaclav Bartuska told the BBC that Europe was currently trying to redraw the map of energy supplies as fast as it could: ""We want to get rid of Russian crude once and for all and we want to be absolutely sure there'll be no need to go back and ask Russia again."" How Germany is getting rid of Russian oil Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Moscow was working on various options in response to the planned embargo. Sanctions were a double-edged sword for the Europeans and others, he said, as the cost for European citizens would increase every day. Oil prices rose by 5% on news of the EU plan to $110 a barrel of Brent Crude. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said in a video briefing on social media thatthe gradual EU ban on oil was ""better than nothing"",external. Any country that opposed the oil embargo was complicit in Russia's crimes in Ukraine, he said, whatever their arguments. As well as seeking a ban on Russian oil, the EU Commission president announced that sanctions would be imposed on military officers involved in suspected war crimes in Bucha and Mariupol. ""This sends another important signal to all perpetrators of the Kremlin's war: We know who you are, and you will be held accountable,"" Ms von der Leyen told the European Parliament on Wednesday. There are plans for a broad ban on three of the biggest Russian state-run broadcasters. ""We have identified these TV channels as mouthpieces that amplify Putin's lies and propaganda aggressively,"" Ms von der Leyen said. Although the three networks were not named, they are thought to include the widely watched Russian-language Rossiya and RTR Planeta channels of state-owned operator VGTRK. The EU has already suspended two networks, RT and Sputnik, that broadcast in English, German and Spanish. A ban would also be imposed on providing European services to Russian companies through accountants, lawyers and spin-doctors, she said. Earlier sanctions have already hit Russian banks but the biggest bank of all, Sberbank, has been left off the list because it was considered necessary for paying for Russian gas. Sberbank makes up over a third of Russia's banking sector and is now set to be removed from the SWIFT global financial messaging system. Two other Russian banks are included in the proposals. Previous sanctions packages have also targeted a number of individuals linked to the Kremlin and the invasion, and the head of the Russian Orthodox Church, Patriarch Kirill, is said to be on the latest list. He has given his full support to the war, prompting Pope Francis to warn him not to become ""Putin's altar boy"". KYIV:Ukrainian villages haunted by the vanished ENERGY:EU divided over how to step away from Russian energy WATCH:The southern villages holding back the Russians READ MORE:Full coverage of the crisis,external The Commission president also gave details of plans to help Ukraine tackle the vast costs of the war and the impact on its economy. Explaining Europe's ""very special responsibility towards Ukraine"", she said Ukraine needed to fund the dramatic fall in its economic output and wider reconstruction. A recovery package would be drawn up that could tackle weaknesses in the Ukrainian economy and help fight corruption, she said. ""We want Ukraine to win this war, but we also want to set the conditions for Ukraine's success in the aftermath of the war."" In a separate move, the EU also promised to increase military aid to neighbouring Moldova, which is under threat from Russian soldiers based in the breakaway Moldova region of Transnistria.  ""We will continue to deepen our partnership with you to bring your country closer to the EU,"" European Council President Charles Michel told Moldova's pro-EU president, Maia Sandu, in Chisinau.

"Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, many countries have pledged to end or restrict their oil and gas imports to curtail Moscow's revenues and hinder its war effort. The Russian economy is highly dependent on its energy sector, and Europe is a major importer of Russian energy, making cutting back difficult. EU nations haveended imports of Russian oil brought in by sea, and a ban on refined oil products will come in from 5 February. The United States said last March it would stop importing Russian oil, and the UK said it was banning Russian crude oil and refined productswith effect from 5 December,external. European countries have sought to reduce their dependence on Russian gas An oil price capapproved by Western allies in Decemberalso aims to prevent Russia getting more than $60 (Â£48) for a barrel of crude oil. Russia's gas sector has also been targeted. The EU said in March it wouldcut gas imports from Russia by two-thirds within a year. The UK, which only imported small quantities of Russian gas, it has now ended this altogether. Urals oil is currently being exported from Russia's north western sea port of Primorsk for around $40 per barrel, from where it has largely gone to European destinations. The value of Russian oil from other ports and pipelines varies, but the Urals price has fallen across the board since the EU banned imports of Russian oil by sea. The price cap on Russian oil was agreed by the world's major economies at the same time. But energy analyst Ben McWilliams believes it is the EU oil embargo impacting the price, rather than the price cap. ""Russian oil is being traded at around $50 (Â£40) per barrel. That has been driven by the embargo because Russia now has to try to sell elsewhere."" Moscow is losing out on about $175m (Â£140m) a day from fossil fuel exports due to these measures, according toa study by the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA).,external India is taking advantage of cheaper oil imported from Russia Major Russian banks have also been removed from the international financial messaging system Swift. Countries continuing to trade with Russia have sought ways around this. Both China and India are increasingly making their oil and gas purchases in their local currencies. India, China and Turkey all ramped up their purchases of Russian oil last year - and together they now make up 70% of all Russian crude flows by sea. And Russia was offering its oil at a significantly lower price than the global benchmark Brent crude. At the start of 2022, Russia supplied less than 2% of India's oil imports, but it is now on course to become its largest single supplier. China's imports of Russian oil have fluctuated, but have also risen over the past year. In 2021,more than half of all Russia's crude oil exports,externalwent to countries in Europe. But in 2022, UK imports of oil from Russia fell sharply and other European countries have cut back too. But some have remained heavily reliant, such as the Slovak Republic and Hungary. European countries have been looking to see if they can source supplies elsewhere. The International Energy Agency (IEA) club of oil importing countries agreed to release 120m barrels of crude from their stocks in 2022. The US also released some of its strategic reserves last year. But calls for oil-rich nations such as Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Venezuela to increase production have not been successful. Opec and other major oil producerscut production in late 2022 to sustain prices. Reducing gas imports from Russia has been a major challenge for many European countries, as the continent has been getting most of its gas through pipelines linked to Russia. In 2021, Russia was supplying EU countries with 40% of their natural gas, with Germany the largest importer, followed by Italy and the Netherlands. That had dropped to around 17% by August 2022,according to EU figures.,external In 2021, the UK got just 4% of its gas supply from Russian. It now imports none. EU states areincreasingly looking to ship in liquefied natural gas,external(LNG) in tankers from producers such as the US and Qatar. Your device may not support this visualisation The shift towards LNG imports by European countries has been very significant, replacing supplies from Russia. However, ""there aren't enough LNG terminals in Europe"", says energy advisor Kate Dourian. ""This will be a problem for Germany, particularly."" There are several new LNG terminals planned and some already under construction across Europe as countries try to boost their capacity. Clarification 21 October: A previous version of this story contained a graphic with the title: 'The UK has much less gas storage than some other European countries'. The aim was to show how much gas the UK had in storage at that time. It was not intended to show the UK's total capacity for gas storage. How can the world cope without Russian oil and gas?

"Inflation in the US is running at a four-decade high The US central bank has announced its biggest interest rate increase in more than two decades as it toughens its fight against fast rising prices. The Federal Reserve said it was lifting its benchmark interest rate by half a percentage point, to a range of 0.75% to 1% after a smaller rise in March. With US inflation at a 40-year high, further hikes are expected. The push marks the latest effort to contain spiking costs being felt by households around the world. India's central bank on Wednesday announced a surprise increase to its benchmark rate, while Australia's central bank recently enacted its first interest rate hike in more than a decade. The Bank of England is also widely expected to raise rates on Thursday, which would be the fourth increase since December. Australia raises interest rates in 11-year first India central bank hikes interest rates after two years How high could UK interest rates go? ""Inflation is much too high and we understand the hardship it is causing,"" Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell said in a press conference in Washington on Wednesday. ""We are movingÂ expeditiously to bring it back down."" By raising rates, banks will make it more expensive for people, businesses and governments to borrow. They expect that to cool demand for goods and services, helping to ease price inflation. But their actions also risk triggering a sharp economic slowdown, especially as new challenges emerge, such as the war in Ukraine and recent Covid shutdowns in China. ""It's a narrow path they have to walk,"" said economist Donald Kohn, who previously served on the Fed's rate-setting committee. ""It's going to be a very difficult task."" Inflation in the US hit 8.5% in March, the sharpest annual rate since 1981, driven by accelerating costs for food and energy. That is well above the bank's 2% target and has become a growing political issue for US President Joe Biden. Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell initially predicted inflation would be ""transitory"" Many economists say the Fed has been slow to respond to the problem, which has been fuelled by a mix of factors, including Covid-related supply shortages, a shock to energy markets from the war in Ukraine, and in the US, massive government spending - including direct cheques to households - to support the economy after the pandemic hit. ""They are well behind the curve. I think most central banks are,"" said Thomas Hoenig, senior fellow at George Mason University's Mercatus Center, who spent nearly 40 years at the Fed. ""But if they try to correct that error with another error - that is to shock the economies with very large interest rate increases - I think they'll pay a pretty big price in terms of a probable recession from that."" The rate increase announced on Wednesday was a unanimous decision. It will push what the Fed charges banks to borrow to a range of 0.75% to 1%, with the higher costs rippling out to consumers in the form of more expensive mortgages, credit cards and other loans. In addition, the bank detailed plans to remove economic support by winding down its balance sheet, which swelled during the pandemic as it purchased assets, including US government debt and mortgage-backed securities, to boost the economy. Starting in June, the bank said it would reduce its holdings by $47.5bn per month, increasing to $95bn in September. Mia Navarro Some people, like first-time homebuyer Mia Navarro, are already feeling the effects of the changes. She sped up her hunt for a one-bedroom apartment in Washington, DC, as she started to see higher mortgage costs limit what she could afford. ""When I originally started my search, I definitely had a bigger budget, based off of what the rates were at the time,"" said the 25-year-old, who this month bought a one-bedroom apartment for $325,000, with a mortgage rate below 5%. ""I immediately decided that I needed to move quickly...and get in there before they hiked too much out of my range and something that I can still afford."" The actions by the bank in charge of the world's largest economy are expected to have widespread repercussions, as many countries and commodity markets rely on the dollar. On Wednesday Gulf states, whose currencies are tied to the dollar, responded to the Fed with interest rate rises of their own. Mr Powell said further rate hikes were planned. He added that officials agreed that boosting rates by half a percentage point ""should be on the table"" in the future, but moving more aggressively was not under active consideration. US stock markets soared following the press conference, which played out largely as investors had expected. Mr Powell said he was confident the US economy was strong enough to handle the bank's more aggressive stance, pointing to the tight job market, in which openings outnumber available workers by nearly two to one. But he acknowledged that the supply shocks from the war in Ukraine and Covid lockdowns in China have presented officials with a tough task - and might force them to move more aggressively to curb demand than they would otherwise. ""We can't really affect oil prices or food and commodity prices - things like that,"" he said. But, he added, ""We have to ensure that inflation expectations remain anchored - that's part of our job too."" ""It puts any central bank in a very difficult situation."" Managing soaring inflation is proving a tall order. Central banks around the world are raising interest rates to lower prices. And the latest aggressive move by the world's most powerful central bank, the US Federal Reserve is one that will reverberate around the globe. Not only will it raise borrowing costs for Americans on everything from credit cards to mortgages, it will also push up the value of the US dollar. In turn, that will push up commodity prices and make it more expensive for emerging economies that borrow in dollars. It is also being felt in financial markets, where asset prices were buoyed by the unprecedented levels of stimulus showered on the economy during the pandemic. As that support is removed, you have already seen more turbulence. But the Fed has little choice. Inflation has consistently burned hotter than expected. The question is, can it successfully tame inflation without a recession. As economists often like to say: ""Expansions don't die of old age"". When will interest rates fall?

"Actress Amber Heard takes the stand in the defamation trial with her ex-husband Johnny Depp After describing the romance of their early relationship, she alleges abuse 'It would be accusations, accusations, and then he would explode,' she alleges Depp sued Heard for $50m (Â£40m) over a Washington Post article, where she claimed she was an abuse victim Heard then counter-sued Depp for $100m Depp has given evidence already - the trial has heard accusations of violence on both sides In his testimony, he denied ever striking a woman Warning: This page contains accusations of physical and verbal abuse You can visit bbc.co.uk/actionline for support By Holly Honderich, Emily McGarvey, and Owen Amos It's now past 5pm in the US, Amber Heard has finished her evidence, and the day's hearings are over. Thanks for reading our live coverage. A reminder that if you have been affected by today's hearing, you can visitthe BBC Action Line. Heard now alleges Depp became violent during a flight to Russia, in which he convinced a flight attendant to do drugs with the couple. According to Heard, Depp became heated when the flight attendant became ""MDMA friendly"". ""After all, she's on drugs,"" she says, adding that Depp grabbed the flight attendant's arm in a fit of jealousy. ""He grabbed her by the wrist and slammed it down on the table, and told her he could break her wrist,"" Heard adds. ""These things would happen."" Depp later accused Heard of having caused the incident, Heard adds. Once in Russia, Heard says an argument about the drug-induced incident on the flight eventually turned violent, with Depp allegedly shoving her into a glass table and striking her in the face. Heard says that by mid-2013, she was torn by feelings that Depp was ""the love of my life"" and also an ""awful thing"". ""When it was good, it was so good,"" Depp says. ""I'd never felt love like that. I felt like he recognised me and I recognised him."" However, Heard says that Depp often became ""this other thing"". ""This other thing was awful,"" she adds. ""It would come out and take over and you couldn't see the Johnny I loved."" Heard also alleges that ""no one was honest"" with Depp about the extent of his drug and alcohol issues. ""He'd pass out in his own vomit. He'd lose control of his own body,"" she says. ""Then he'd walk around saying he didn't have a problem."" Today, the court is hearing from Amber Heard. It previously heard from Johnny Depp. A reminder of some of his testimony: This case involves accusations of domestic and sexual violence. If you have have been affected by this, or any other issues in this story you canvisit the BBC Action Line. The following post contains allegations of sexual violence Amber Heard is describing an altercation with Depp on a trip to Hicksville, what she describes as a ""fancy trailer park... in the middle of nowhere"". The plan was to have a party in the desert, she says. All was well until a woman they were with suddenly ""leaned
     into me, put her head on my shoulder and put her hand on my arm...I took
     it to be the effects of the drugs"", she says. Members of their group had brought mushrooms and ecstasy. Depp became incensed, Heard says, and began shouting at the woman next to her. ""He grabbed her wrist and said 'do you
     know how many pounds of pressure it takes to break a human wrist,'"" Heard says, becoming increasingly emotional. According to Heard, the two returned to their trailer where the fighting intensified. Looking for his drugs, Depp ""rips my underwear off and then proceeds to do a cavity search"", Heard says, fighting back tears. ""I just stood there."" According to Heard, Depp ""backhanded"" her during an argument about the alleged affairs. ""He wears a lot of rings,"" she says. ""I remember feeling like my lip went into my teeth. It got a little blood on the wall."" The court was also shown a picture - from around March 2013 - that Heard sent to her mother which shows a prominent bruise on her left arm. She says that the bruise was sustained during an argument in which she threw a vase at Depp. ""He grabbed me by the arm and kind of held me on the floor screaming at me,"" she says. During these incidents, Heard explains, she ""didn't make a big deal out of it"" because she was ""so caught up in the relationship"". ""I pride myself on being tough,"" she says.  This video can not be played Depp 'slapped me across the face' over Wino tattoo Heard says that Depp accused her of having affairs during a particularly turbulent time in their relationship in 2013. ""The month got really crazy,"" she says, after he allegedly began drinking spirits again. ""He was accusing me of having affairs,"" she adds, calling it a ""revolving door of accusations"". In one instance, she alleges, a painting she owned - that had been painted by an ex - was seen as evidence of infidelity by Depp. She adds that he tried to burn it, unsuccessfully. ""He wasn't making sense,"" she says. ""He seemed to decide that the painting was an affair he couldn't forgive me for."" The entire month was like a ""never ending fight"" with Depp. All the while, Heard adds, she was ""madly in love"" with him. Heard says Depp started sneaking the drink and drugs ""so I had to look for clues"". ""He'd have this blowout, leave, disappear. I'd be committed to ending the relationship - he'd come back clean and sober and he'd be extra nice and extra apologetic and we'd be good again,"" she says. ""Johnny on speed is very different from Johnny on opioids, Johnny on opioids is very different to Adderall and cocaine Johnny - but I had to get good at paying attention to the different versions of him."" She says Depp's drinking correlated with the violence - adding that she told her therapist about the incidents as well as her mother. Amber Heard is going over instances throughout 2012 when, she says, Johnny Depp was emotionally and physically abusive. ""It would be accusations, accusations and then he would explode,"" she says, and Depp would slap her and ""backhand"" her. I was ""walking on eggshells"", she says, never knowing what she did wrong. Again, Heard describes a cycle: Depp would sober up and return to her repentant, loving and sober. Depp's alleged substance use has been a frequent theme at trial. Heard's team says Depp abused drugs and alcohol throughout the relationship. According to Depp, he was sober for much of their time together, after detoxing from the opioid Oxycodone in 2014. After Depp slapped Heard for the first time, she says, he slapped her again. She lost her balance, she says, and ended up on the carpet. After the incident, Heard says she received calls and texts from Depp apologising. Heard says Depp told her that he ""killed that monster"" and said ""I'll never lay a hand on you again"". Heard says she stayed in the relationship - but Depp started drinking again and began turning up at her house in the middle of the night ""to catch her"" cheating, as well as sending controlling texts. ""He started punching walls next to my head,"" Heard says, adding that the violence would escalate ""to the point he would push me or shove me down"". ""I would get back up and look him in the eye, it was my way of defending myself - he'd ask if we wanted to go again and he'd hit me and shove me down."" This case involves accusations of domestic and sexual violence. If you have have been affected by this, or any other issues in this story you canvisit the BBC Action Line. Heard is now describing the first time she claims Depp hit her. ""I will never forget it - it changed my life,"" she says. ""I was sitting on the couch, we were having a normal conversion, there was no fighting, no nothing. He was drinking and I didn't realise at the time, but I think he was using cocaine, he had a jar of cocaine. ""I asked him about the tattoo he has on his arm, it looked like black marks, I didn't know what it said... and I asked him what it said - he said 'Wino'... ""I laughed because I thought he was joking, and he slapped me across the face..."" She adds: ""And I laughed because I thought 'this must be a joke' - I didn't know what was going on. ""I just stared at him, kind of laughing, still thinking he was going to start laughing and was going to tell me it was a joke. ""He said: 'You think it's funny?'... ""It was clear it wasn't a joke anymore. I stopped laughing but I didn't know what else to do."" After three weeks of trial, we are finally hearing Heard's own allegations of abuse. So far she's described a dream-like affair with Depp in their early days together. Now, she describes when their relationship took a turn, over the course of 2012. Depp would disappear for ""days"", she says, coming back to make disparing, demeaning comments about her. Depp ""would make these comments about whoring myself out, but do so in the context of me acting,"" she says. But then, she says, the Depp she loved came back. ""He would go back to this unbelievably nice, sensitive, kind, generous man,"" she says. ""I would feel so loved."" We heard earlier about the knife Heard bought for Depp - with Depp's lawyer suggesting it showed Heard did not fear Depp. Now, Heard has discussed the knife. She says she visited Depp while he was filming the movie Lone Ranger in the US. She would stay at his accommodation and wait for him to come home and have dinner ready. She says she would take off Depp's boots: ""Anything I could do to show love."" ""Johnny had a thing for turquoise and he loved knives, and when he loves things he does a lot of it,"" she says. ""He'd keep getting me daggers, long curved daggers and talked a lot about his knife and gun collection. ""I picked up a beautiful turquoise handled knife with a saying Johnny would say all the time - 'until death.'"" Heard becomes emotional as she describes the early days of her relationship with Johnny Depp. They had to date in secret because his split - from long time partner Vanessa Paradis - was not yet public, she says. ""It felt like a dream. It felt like absolute magic,"" she says, her voice breaking, describing their days as a ""bubble of secrecy"". Heard describes reconnecting with Johnny Depp a couple of years after filming for the Rum Diary ended, during press promotion for the film. Meeting in Depp's hotel room at the start of the tour, Heard describes an ""instant reconnection"" with her former co-star. ""It felt like there was an electricity,"" she says. ""He grabbed both sides of my face. He kissed me and I kissed him back."" Over the course of the press tour, she says ""we fell in love"". ""It was on, I'll put it that way,"" she says.  This video can not be played Amber Heard testifies: Trial is 'painful and difficult' Heard says she and Depp were in relationships when filming for the Rum Diary started - but shared a ""flirtatious friendship"" on set. ""I felt chemistry, I felt this other thing that went beyond the pale of my job and Johnny clearly felt that way too,"" Heard says. ""But I remember feeling intimated and nervous about that so we went our separate ways and I didn't hear from him for a long time."" She says she next heard from Depp when he called her to invite her to his Beverly Hills home, with the Rum Diary director, to talk about the movie . ""But it was clearly not about the movie,"" Heard adds. ""So I said my friends were in town, I hung up and felt startled. I didn't know what to do."" She said Depp sent her numerous gifts after filming wrapped - including a dress she wore in the movie, expensive collectable books, and some guitars - adding that she rejected the gifts on two occasions.

"This video can not be played 'Donât discount us' - Ratcliffe on Chelsea bid Billionaire Sir Jim Ratcliffe says he is ""not giving up"" on taking over Chelsea despite ""disappointing communication"" over his Â£4.25bn offer. Ratcliffe, the majority shareholder of chemical group Ineos, made the late bid for the Premier League club on Friday. Earlier on Wednesday, Ineos director Tom Crottysaid,externalthe offer had been rejected by the firm handling the sale. But, speaking to BBC sports editor Dan Roan, Ratcliffe said: ""Consideration should be given to a British bid."" A consortium led by LA Dodgers owner Todd Boehly isunderstood to be the preferred bidderfor Chelsea. American investment firm Raine has been tasked with selling Chelsea and the UK government is expected to issue a new licence, allowing the club to be sold, once a preferred buyer has been highlighted. Ratcliffe said his group had held ""positive talks"" with the UK government, but has not spoken to current Blues owner Roman Abramovich. ""We had a communication with Raine and met with them at the end of last week. We presented a bid but have heard very little back from them,"" Ratcliffe told the BBC in his first interview since making the last-gasp bid. ""My message to Raine is don't discount our offer. We are British and have great intentions for Chelsea. If I was Raine I wouldn't close any door."" Ratcliffe added that the Boehly consortium would not be allowed in the big American sports leagues because rules prevent clubs being majority-owned by private equity investors. In a wide-ranging interview in Madrid, Ratcliffe also said: He is originally a Manchester United fan and said he has ""split loyalties"" between the two clubs He wants to turn Chelsea into a club of ""the same stature as the city of London"" The bid is not about making profit from Chelsea as Ineos makes ""lots of money from chemicals"" Stamford Bridge needs a ""world-class capacity as well as a world-class stadium"" and will not be renamed Significant investment would go into Chelsea's women's and academy teams His group ""couldn't get comfortable"" with Chelsea's valuation when they first expressed interest in buying the club in 2018 France striker Kylian Mbappe would be his dream signing for Chelsea, but concedes he is likely to move to Real Madrid He thinks current Blues manager Thomas Tuchel is ""excellent"" Abramovich announced on 2 March he was planning to sell the club, shortly before he was sanctioned by the UK government in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The Russian billionaire is understood to have strong ties to Russian president Vladimir Putin and his assets, including Chelsea, were frozen. Ratcliffe, whose company bought the Team Sky cycling franchise in 2019 and runs French football team Nice, has pledged to invest Â£1.75bn into the club over 10 years. But the offer arrived on Friday morning, weeks beyond the initial deadline for bids of 18 March. Asked why his group's bid was submitted late, Ratcliffe said: ""I think that is quite simple - it is a big decision to buy a national asset and it's a big commitment in terms of time and money. ""We're there for the long term. That's a lot of responsibility to take on and it takes time to reach a decision to be fully committed. ""We got there at the end of the day and we are committed. We're not giving up."" Ratcliffe, 69, emphasised on several occasions how he thought a ""British business buying a British asset"" should be an important consideration in the bidding process for Chelsea. He suggested some non-British owners ""do not understand the heritage"" of Premier League clubs and claims there has been ""a lot of angst"" about Chelsea ending up ""in the hands of people who don't have a long-term vision for it"". American investor and businessman Boehly - who has offered around Â£2.5bn for the club - has a reported net worth of $4.5bn (Â£3.6bn) according to Forbes. He is a part owner of the Dodgers - a US baseball franchise - and US women's basketball outfit the Los Angeles Sparks, while he also owns a stake in the renowned LA Lakers NBA franchise. His consortium includes Swiss billionaire Hansjorg Wyss, American PR executive Barbara Charone, British businessman Jonathan Goldstein and British journalist Daniel Finkelstein. But the bid is being financed by California-based private equity group Clearlake Capital which is expected to have most of Chelsea's shares if the consortium succeeds. ""I don't know Todd and I don't know his group,"" Ratcliffe said. ""What I do know is I spent quite a few years of my life working in the world of venture capital and private equity. ""Your focus is always on how do I invest and make that money grow, and it's typically a five-year time horizon - and their main funder is private equity and venture capital."" ""In America the big sports clubs won't allow those people to come in and buy the clubs, so you can't buy an NFL football club, but in the UK you can. ""We're not interested in making money out of Chelsea. The investment in Chelsea is a long-term thing. ""Can we run that club really, really well and turn it into one of the finest clubs in Europe? That's our ambition with Chelsea."" Lancashire-born Ratcliffe says he is still a Manchester United fan because he used to watch them when he was growing up. He says he has made no secret of the fact he has been interested in buying a Premier League club and adds the reason he is not bidding for the Red Devils is simple: they are not for sale. On his attraction to Chelsea, he said: ""I have a house in Chelsea, I've lived in Chelsea for many years, I've had a season ticket for many years, I have a business that's based in Chelsea. ""Then if you look at the wider picture of football - football is the biggest sport in the world, the British league is the biggest league in the world and Chelsea is one of the best clubs in that league. ""When I was living in London for many years, Chelsea I could go and watch. It was quite difficult to go and watch United so I have split loyalties.""

"Inflation in the US is running at a four-decade high The US central bank has announced its biggest interest rate increase in more than two decades as it toughens its fight against fast rising prices. The Federal Reserve said it was lifting its benchmark interest rate by half a percentage point, to a range of 0.75% to 1% after a smaller rise in March. With US inflation at a 40-year high, further hikes are expected. The push marks the latest effort to contain spiking costs being felt by households around the world. India's central bank on Wednesday announced a surprise increase to its benchmark rate, while Australia's central bank recently enacted its first interest rate hike in more than a decade. The Bank of England is also widely expected to raise rates on Thursday, which would be the fourth increase since December. Australia raises interest rates in 11-year first India central bank hikes interest rates after two years How high could UK interest rates go? ""Inflation is much too high and we understand the hardship it is causing,"" Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell said in a press conference in Washington on Wednesday. ""We are movingÂ expeditiously to bring it back down."" By raising rates, banks will make it more expensive for people, businesses and governments to borrow. They expect that to cool demand for goods and services, helping to ease price inflation. But their actions also risk triggering a sharp economic slowdown, especially as new challenges emerge, such as the war in Ukraine and recent Covid shutdowns in China. ""It's a narrow path they have to walk,"" said economist Donald Kohn, who previously served on the Fed's rate-setting committee. ""It's going to be a very difficult task."" Inflation in the US hit 8.5% in March, the sharpest annual rate since 1981, driven by accelerating costs for food and energy. That is well above the bank's 2% target and has become a growing political issue for US President Joe Biden. Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell initially predicted inflation would be ""transitory"" Many economists say the Fed has been slow to respond to the problem, which has been fuelled by a mix of factors, including Covid-related supply shortages, a shock to energy markets from the war in Ukraine, and in the US, massive government spending - including direct cheques to households - to support the economy after the pandemic hit. ""They are well behind the curve. I think most central banks are,"" said Thomas Hoenig, senior fellow at George Mason University's Mercatus Center, who spent nearly 40 years at the Fed. ""But if they try to correct that error with another error - that is to shock the economies with very large interest rate increases - I think they'll pay a pretty big price in terms of a probable recession from that."" The rate increase announced on Wednesday was a unanimous decision. It will push what the Fed charges banks to borrow to a range of 0.75% to 1%, with the higher costs rippling out to consumers in the form of more expensive mortgages, credit cards and other loans. In addition, the bank detailed plans to remove economic support by winding down its balance sheet, which swelled during the pandemic as it purchased assets, including US government debt and mortgage-backed securities, to boost the economy. Starting in June, the bank said it would reduce its holdings by $47.5bn per month, increasing to $95bn in September. Mia Navarro Some people, like first-time homebuyer Mia Navarro, are already feeling the effects of the changes. She sped up her hunt for a one-bedroom apartment in Washington, DC, as she started to see higher mortgage costs limit what she could afford. ""When I originally started my search, I definitely had a bigger budget, based off of what the rates were at the time,"" said the 25-year-old, who this month bought a one-bedroom apartment for $325,000, with a mortgage rate below 5%. ""I immediately decided that I needed to move quickly...and get in there before they hiked too much out of my range and something that I can still afford."" The actions by the bank in charge of the world's largest economy are expected to have widespread repercussions, as many countries and commodity markets rely on the dollar. On Wednesday Gulf states, whose currencies are tied to the dollar, responded to the Fed with interest rate rises of their own. Mr Powell said further rate hikes were planned. He added that officials agreed that boosting rates by half a percentage point ""should be on the table"" in the future, but moving more aggressively was not under active consideration. US stock markets soared following the press conference, which played out largely as investors had expected. Mr Powell said he was confident the US economy was strong enough to handle the bank's more aggressive stance, pointing to the tight job market, in which openings outnumber available workers by nearly two to one. But he acknowledged that the supply shocks from the war in Ukraine and Covid lockdowns in China have presented officials with a tough task - and might force them to move more aggressively to curb demand than they would otherwise. ""We can't really affect oil prices or food and commodity prices - things like that,"" he said. But, he added, ""We have to ensure that inflation expectations remain anchored - that's part of our job too."" ""It puts any central bank in a very difficult situation."" Managing soaring inflation is proving a tall order. Central banks around the world are raising interest rates to lower prices. And the latest aggressive move by the world's most powerful central bank, the US Federal Reserve is one that will reverberate around the globe. Not only will it raise borrowing costs for Americans on everything from credit cards to mortgages, it will also push up the value of the US dollar. In turn, that will push up commodity prices and make it more expensive for emerging economies that borrow in dollars. It is also being felt in financial markets, where asset prices were buoyed by the unprecedented levels of stimulus showered on the economy during the pandemic. As that support is removed, you have already seen more turbulence. But the Fed has little choice. Inflation has consistently burned hotter than expected. The question is, can it successfully tame inflation without a recession. As economists often like to say: ""Expansions don't die of old age"". When will interest rates fall?

"Halifax has said sorry after it sent emails to customers incorrectly saying that the Bank of England had raised interest rates. Some mortgage customers received a message on Tuesday saying ""the Bank of England base rate has changed today"". But the decision by the central bank on whether or not to raise interest rates is not due until Thursday lunchtime. The lender followed up with a second email later, apologising to customers for ""any confusion"" caused. It added that the email had been prepared in advance of Thursday's decision by the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) ""so that in the event of a rise we could quickly advise customers and help them understand how that might affect their mortgage"". ""We are emailing customers today to apologise and confirm that there are no changes to their mortgage or rates,"" they added. Halifax, which is one of the UK's biggest mortgage lenders, would not tell the BBC how many of its customers had received the email. Some Lloyds customers also received the message by mistake, as well as the subsequent apology. Part of the Lloyds Banking Group, Halifax told customers on a fixed-rate mortgage that their repayments will not be affected by an increase. If interest rates rise, it can make borrowing more expensive - especially for homeowners with mortgages on a variable rate. Prices arenow rising at their fastest rate in 30 yearsin the UK, as coronavirus restrictions ease and consumers spend more.

The next announcement from the nine UK economists who make up the MPC is due on Thursday at 12:00.

""Of course, it should be recognised that raising interest rates will do very little to moderate inflation over the next six months and that the aim of tightening policy now is to prevent inflation from remaining above 2% over the medium-term and to protect the central bank's credibility,"" he added.

Thanks for reading our live coverage. A reminder that if you have been affected by today's hearing, you can visitthe BBC Action Line. Heard now alleges Depp became violent during a flight to Russia, in which he convinced a flight attendant to do drugs with the couple. According to Heard, Depp became heated when the flight attendant became ""MDMA friendly"". ""After all, she's on drugs,"" she says, adding that Depp grabbed the flight attendant's arm in a fit of jealousy. ""He grabbed her by the wrist and slammed it down on the table, and told her he could break her wrist,"" Heard adds. ""These things would happen."" Depp later accused Heard of having caused the incident, Heard adds. Once in Russia, Heard says an argument about the drug-induced incident on the flight eventually turned violent, with Depp allegedly shoving her into a glass table and striking her in the face. Heard says that by mid-2013, she was torn by feelings that Depp was ""the love of my life"" and also an ""awful thing"". ""When it was good, it was so good,"" Depp says. ""I'd never felt love like that. I felt like he recognised me and I recognised him."" However, Heard says that Depp often became ""this other thing"". ""This other thing was awful,"" she adds. ""It would come out and take over and you couldn't see the Johnny I loved."" Heard also alleges that ""no one was honest"" with Depp about the extent of his drug and alcohol issues. ""He'd pass out in his own vomit. He'd lose control of his own body,"" she says. ""Then he'd walk around saying he didn't have a problem."" Today, the court is hearing from Amber Heard.

     into me, put her head on my shoulder and put her hand on my arm...I took
     it to be the effects of the drugs"", she says. Members of their group had brought mushrooms and ecstasy. Depp became incensed, Heard says, and began shouting at the woman next to her. ""He grabbed her wrist and said 'do you
     know how many pounds of pressure it takes to break a human wrist,'"" Heard says, becoming increasingly emotional. According to Heard, the two returned to their trailer where the fighting intensified. Looking for his drugs, Depp ""rips my underwear off and then proceeds to do a cavity search"", Heard says, fighting back tears. ""I just stood there."" According to Heard, Depp ""backhanded"" her during an argument about the alleged affairs. ""He wears a lot of rings,"" she says. ""I remember feeling like my lip went into my teeth. It got a little blood on the wall."" The court was also shown a picture - from around March 2013 - that Heard sent to her mother which shows a prominent bruise on her left arm. She says that the bruise was sustained during an argument in which she threw a vase at Depp. ""He grabbed me by the arm and kind of held me on the floor screaming at me,"" she says. During these incidents, Heard explains, she ""didn't make a big deal out of it"" because she was ""so caught up in the relationship"". ""I pride myself on being tough,"" she says.  This video can not be played Depp 'slapped me across the face' over Wino tattoo Heard says that Depp accused her of having affairs during a particularly turbulent time in their relationship in 2013. ""The month got really crazy,"" she says, after he allegedly began drinking spirits again. ""He was accusing me of having affairs,"" she adds, calling it a ""revolving door of accusations"". In one instance, she alleges, a painting she owned - that had been painted by an ex - was seen as evidence of infidelity by Depp. She adds that he tried to burn it, unsuccessfully. ""He wasn't making sense,"" she says. ""He seemed to decide that the painting was an affair he couldn't forgive me for."" The entire month was like a ""never ending fight"" with Depp. All the while, Heard adds, she was ""madly in love"" with him. Heard says Depp started sneaking the drink and drugs ""so I had to look for clues"". ""He'd have this blowout, leave, disappear. I'd be committed to ending the relationship - he'd come back clean and sober and he'd be extra nice and extra apologetic and we'd be good again,"" she says. ""Johnny on speed is very different from Johnny on opioids, Johnny on opioids is very different to Adderall and cocaine Johnny - but I had to get good at paying attention to the different versions of him."" She says Depp's drinking correlated with the violence - adding that she told her therapist about the incidents as well as her mother. Amber Heard is going over instances throughout 2012 when, she says, Johnny Depp was emotionally and physically abusive. ""It would be accusations, accusations and then he would explode,"" she says, and Depp would slap her and ""backhand"" her. I was ""walking on eggshells"", she says, never knowing what she did wrong. Again, Heard describes a cycle: Depp would sober up and return to her repentant, loving and sober. Depp's alleged substance use has been a frequent theme at trial. Heard's team says Depp abused drugs and alcohol throughout the relationship. According to Depp, he was sober for much of their time together, after detoxing from the opioid Oxycodone in 2014. After Depp slapped Heard for the first time, she says, he slapped her again. She lost her balance, she says, and ended up on the carpet. After the incident, Heard says she received calls and texts from Depp apologising. Heard says Depp told her that he ""killed that monster"" and said ""I'll never lay a hand on you again"". Heard says she stayed in the relationship - but Depp started drinking again and began turning up at her house in the middle of the night ""to catch her"" cheating, as well as sending controlling texts. ""He started punching walls next to my head,"" Heard says, adding that the violence would escalate ""to the point he would push me or shove me down"". ""I would get back up and look him in the eye, it was my way of defending myself - he'd ask if we wanted to go again and he'd hit me and shove me down."" This case involves accusations of domestic and sexual violence. If you have have been affected by this, or any other issues in this story you canvisit the BBC Action Line. Heard is now describing the first time she claims Depp hit her. ""I will never forget it - it changed my life,"" she says. ""I was sitting on the couch, we were having a normal conversion, there was no fighting, no nothing. He was drinking and I didn't realise at the time, but I think he was using cocaine, he had a jar of cocaine. ""I asked him about the tattoo he has on his arm, it looked like black marks, I didn't know what it said... and I asked him what it said - he said 'Wino'... ""I laughed because I thought he was joking, and he slapped me across the face..."" She adds: ""And I laughed because I thought 'this must be a joke' - I didn't know what was going on. ""I just stared at him, kind of laughing, still thinking he was going to start laughing and was going to tell me it was a joke. ""He said: 'You think it's funny?'... ""It was clear it wasn't a joke anymore. I stopped laughing but I didn't know what else to do."" After three weeks of trial, we are finally hearing Heard's own allegations of abuse. So far she's described a dream-like affair with Depp in their early days together. Now, she describes when their relationship took a turn, over the course of 2012. Depp would disappear for ""days"", she says, coming back to make disparing, demeaning comments about her. Depp ""would make these comments about whoring myself out, but do so in the context of me acting,"" she says. But then, she says, the Depp she loved came back. ""He would go back to this unbelievably nice, sensitive, kind, generous man,"" she says. ""I would feel so loved."" We heard earlier about the knife Heard bought for Depp - with Depp's lawyer suggesting it showed Heard did not fear Depp. Now, Heard has discussed the knife. She says she visited Depp while he was filming the movie Lone Ranger in the US. She would stay at his accommodation and wait for him to come home and have dinner ready. She says she would take off Depp's boots: ""Anything I could do to show love."" ""Johnny had a thing for turquoise and he loved knives, and when he loves things he does a lot of it,"" she says. ""He'd keep getting me daggers, long curved daggers and talked a lot about his knife and gun collection. ""I picked up a beautiful turquoise handled knife with a saying Johnny would say all the time - 'until death.'"" Heard becomes emotional as she describes the early days of her relationship with Johnny Depp. They had to date in secret because his split - from long time partner Vanessa Paradis - was not yet public, she says. ""It felt like a dream. It felt like absolute magic,"" she says, her voice breaking, describing their days as a ""bubble of secrecy"". Heard describes reconnecting with Johnny Depp a couple of years after filming for the Rum Diary ended, during press promotion for the film. Meeting in Depp's hotel room at the start of the tour, Heard describes an ""instant reconnection"" with her former co-star. ""It felt like there was an electricity,"" she says. ""He grabbed both sides of my face. He kissed me and I kissed him back."" Over the course of the press tour, she says ""we fell in love"". ""It was on, I'll put it that way,"" she says.  This video can not be played Amber Heard testifies: Trial is 'painful and difficult' Heard says she and Depp were in relationships when filming for the Rum Diary started - but shared a ""flirtatious friendship"" on set. ""I felt chemistry, I felt this other thing that went beyond the pale of my job and Johnny clearly felt that way too,"" Heard says. ""But I remember feeling intimated and nervous about that so we went our separate ways and I didn't hear from him for a long time."" She says she next heard from Depp when he called her to invite her to his Beverly Hills home, with the Rum Diary director, to talk about the movie . ""But it was clearly not about the movie,"" Heard adds. ""So I said my friends were in town, I hung up and felt startled. I didn't know what to do."" She said Depp sent her numerous gifts after filming wrapped - including a dress she wore in the movie, expensive collectable books, and some guitars - adding that she rejected the gifts on two occasions.

"Environment Secretary George Eustice has been criticised as ""out of touch"" and ""patronising"" for advising those struggling with the rising cost of living to buy cheaper food items. Speaking to Sky News, Mr Eustice said opting for value brands would help people manage their household budget. It comes on the last day of local election campaigns, where concerns over rising prices have featured heavily. In recent months, UK inflation has risen to 7% - the highest in 30 years. The Bank of England has warned inflation could rise further, potentially hitting double figures in October. Why are prices rising so quickly?

We can't go too far, we can't mitigate all of the impacts otherwise we will fuel even greater inflation.""

"Actress Amber Heard takes the stand in the defamation trial with her ex-husband Johnny Depp After describing the romance of their early relationship, she alleges abuse 'It would be accusations, accusations, and then he would explode,' she alleges Depp sued Heard for $50m (Â£40m) over a Washington Post article, where she claimed she was an abuse victim Heard then counter-sued Depp for $100m Depp has given evidence already - the trial has heard accusations of violence on both sides In his testimony, he denied ever striking a woman Warning: This page contains accusations of physical and verbal abuse You can visit bbc.co.uk/actionline for support By Holly Honderich, Emily McGarvey, and Owen Amos It's now past 5pm in the US, Amber Heard has finished her evidence, and the day's hearings are over. Thanks for reading our live coverage. A reminder that if you have been affected by today's hearing, you can visitthe BBC Action Line. Heard now alleges Depp became violent during a flight to Russia, in which he convinced a flight attendant to do drugs with the couple. According to Heard, Depp became heated when the flight attendant became ""MDMA friendly"". ""After all, she's on drugs,"" she says, adding that Depp grabbed the flight attendant's arm in a fit of jealousy. ""He grabbed her by the wrist and slammed it down on the table, and told her he could break her wrist,"" Heard adds. ""These things would happen."" Depp later accused Heard of having caused the incident, Heard adds. Once in Russia, Heard says an argument about the drug-induced incident on the flight eventually turned violent, with Depp allegedly shoving her into a glass table and striking her in the face. Heard says that by mid-2013, she was torn by feelings that Depp was ""the love of my life"" and also an ""awful thing"". ""When it was good, it was so good,"" Depp says. ""I'd never felt love like that. I felt like he recognised me and I recognised him."" However, Heard says that Depp often became ""this other thing"". ""This other thing was awful,"" she adds. ""It would come out and take over and you couldn't see the Johnny I loved."" Heard also alleges that ""no one was honest"" with Depp about the extent of his drug and alcohol issues. ""He'd pass out in his own vomit. He'd lose control of his own body,"" she says. ""Then he'd walk around saying he didn't have a problem."" Today, the court is hearing from Amber Heard. It previously heard from Johnny Depp. A reminder of some of his testimony: This case involves accusations of domestic and sexual violence.

"Dave Chappelle was performing at the Netflix Is A Joke Festival A man has been charged with felony assault with a deadly weapon after an on-stage attack on US comedian Dave Chappelle. The suspect pointed a replica handgun that contained a knife blade at Chappelle, a spokeswoman for the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) said. Chappelle was unharmed, but the suspect has been taken to a local hospital for medical treatment. The incident took place while Chappelle was performing at the Hollywood Bowl. Clips shared on social media,externalshowed someone charging into the star during his set at the Netflix Is A Joke Festival on Tuesday. The LAPD spokeswoman said: ""A famous comedian was performing at the Hollywood Bowl and when he finished his act a male jumped on to the stage and tackled the celebrity. ""The suspect produced a replica handgun and pointed the item at the victim. He was taken into custody and was arrested for assault with a deadly weapon."" The LAPD identified the suspect as 23-year-old Isaiah Lee, who is being held in jail on a $30,000 (Â£24,000) bond. Last year, Chappelle faced criticism and protests when his Netflix special was accused of being transphobic. After returning to the stage on Tuesday, the 48-year-old appeared to make light of the controversy, suggesting to the audience that the attacker ""was a trans man"". According to ABC journalist Stephanie Wash, fellow comic Chris Rock - who was slapped on stage by Will Smith at the Oscars in March - then came on stage with Chappelle. Allow Twitter content?

Carpenter told the PA news agency an attacker ""lunged"" at the comedian as he headlined the event, sending him ""flying in the air"". She said: ""It looked like someone was dashing across the stage from the side. He fell backwards on to his back, with his arms and legs up in the air. He was obviously in shock. We were all in shock. ""I thought for a moment OK, is this a prank? Because they had made some Will Smith jokes. Even though Chris Rock was there, Dave was making some jokes, it was fair game, right?"" In one video, Chappelle could be seen thanking his famous friends for helping out, saying: ""Whenever you're in trouble, Jamie Foxx will show up in a sheriff's hat."" ""I thought that was part of the show,"" Foxx responded. Chappelle joked: ""I've been doing this 35 years. I just stomped a [person] backstage. I've always wanted to do that."" Chappelle's spokesperson, Carla Sims, said afterwards: ""As unfortunate and unsettling as the incident was, Chappelle went on with the show, crediting Rock and Foxx with helping to ""calm the crowd."" Jimmy Carr, the British comedian whosparked outrage earlier this year for a routine about the Holocaustin his own Netflix stand-up special, also performed at the streaming giant's event on Tuesday. Carr tweeted afterwards,externalto say the show was ""crazy"" and he was ""just happy everyone's OK"". A spokeswoman for the Hollywood Bowl said an investigation has been launched, telling PA: ""The incident that occurred at the Hollywood Bowl on May 3 2022 is an active investigation and we are unable to comment further at this time."" Dave Chappelle alongside fellow comedian Jerry Seinfeld on Sunday, at a lunchtime event for the Netflix Is A Joke Festival In October, about100 people protested outside Netflix's headquartersover the airing of a comedy special by Chappelle, which they said was transphobic. They had objected to The Closer, in which he said ""gender is a fact"" and that LGBT people were ""too sensitive"". Chappelle later hit backat those who he said wanted to ""cancel"" him. ""To the transgender community, I am more than willing to give you an audience,"" he said. ""But you will not summon me. I am not bending to anybody's demands."" The likes of Seth Rogen, Snoop Dogg, Bill Burr and Pete Davidson are also starring at Netflix's inaugural comedy festival, as well as Jerry Seinfeld and recent Oscars co-host Wanda Sykes.

"Environment Secretary George Eustice has been criticised as ""out of touch"" and ""patronising"" for advising those struggling with the rising cost of living to buy cheaper food items. Speaking to Sky News, Mr Eustice said opting for value brands would help people manage their household budget. It comes on the last day of local election campaigns, where concerns over rising prices have featured heavily. In recent months, UK inflation has risen to 7% - the highest in 30 years. The Bank of England has warned inflation could rise further, potentially hitting double figures in October. Why are prices rising so quickly? Cost of living dominates in key election battleground What to look out for as local elections loom Asked about the squeeze on people's finances, Mr Eustice told the BBC the government had put in place a ""package of measures"" including a rebate on energy costs. ""We've got to take a proportionate approach to try to help people through that difficult time. We can't go too far, we can't mitigate all of the impacts otherwise we will fuel even greater inflation."" Later, he told Sky News that due to a ""competitive market"" the UK had the lowest household food expenditure in Europe. He said people who chose value brands could ""actually contain and manage their household budget"". Responding to Mr Eustice's remarks, Labour's shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said: ""Hard-pressed Brits need support"" and urged the government to hold an emergency budget and reduce energy bills through a windfall tax on oil and gas companies. ""The response by the Conservatives to the cost-of-living crisis has been nothing short of insulting. They are out of touch and out of ideas."" Asked if he agreed with his minister's comments, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the government wanted to ""help people in any way we can through the aftershocks of Covid"". This video can not be played Boris Johnson says  the government wants to help people ""in any way we can through the aftershocks of Covid"". He said ""immediate"" support was available, through a rebate package and cold weather payments. The SNP's Westminster deputy leader Kirsten Oswald said: ""The remarks from a senior Tory government minister that families struggling with the Tory-made cost-of-living crisis should buy value brand products are utterly patronising and insulting. ""Rather than bringing forward meaningful financial measures to help support families and to put money into people's pockets, the Tory government is instead sitting on its hands and resorting to treating people with contempt. And the Liberal Democrat's Wendy Chamberlain said: "" Families and pensioners who can't afford their weekly shop need more help, not patronising advice from a clueless minister.""

"Actress Amber Heard takes the stand in the defamation trial with her ex-husband Johnny Depp After describing the romance of their early relationship, she alleges abuse 'It would be accusations, accusations, and then he would explode,' she alleges Depp sued Heard for $50m (Â£40m) over a Washington Post article, where she claimed she was an abuse victim Heard then counter-sued Depp for $100m Depp has given evidence already - the trial has heard accusations of violence on both sides In his testimony, he denied ever striking a woman Warning: This page contains accusations of physical and verbal abuse You can visit bbc.co.uk/actionline for support By Holly Honderich, Emily McGarvey, and Owen Amos It's now past 5pm in the US, Amber Heard has finished her evidence, and the day's hearings are over. Thanks for reading our live coverage. A reminder that if you have been affected by today's hearing, you can visitthe BBC Action Line. Heard now alleges Depp became violent during a flight to Russia, in which he convinced a flight attendant to do drugs with the couple. According to Heard, Depp became heated when the flight attendant became ""MDMA friendly"". ""After all, she's on drugs,"" she says, adding that Depp grabbed the flight attendant's arm in a fit of jealousy. ""He grabbed her by the wrist and slammed it down on the table, and told her he could break her wrist,"" Heard adds. ""These things would happen."" Depp later accused Heard of having caused the incident, Heard adds. Once in Russia, Heard says an argument about the drug-induced incident on the flight eventually turned violent, with Depp allegedly shoving her into a glass table and striking her in the face. Heard says that by mid-2013, she was torn by feelings that Depp was ""the love of my life"" and also an ""awful thing"". ""When it was good, it was so good,"" Depp says. ""I'd never felt love like that. I felt like he recognised me and I recognised him."" However, Heard says that Depp often became ""this other thing"". ""This other thing was awful,"" she adds. ""It would come out and take over and you couldn't see the Johnny I loved."" Heard also alleges that ""no one was honest"" with Depp about the extent of his drug and alcohol issues. ""He'd pass out in his own vomit. He'd lose control of his own body,"" she says. ""Then he'd walk around saying he didn't have a problem."" Today, the court is hearing from Amber Heard. It previously heard from Johnny Depp. A reminder of some of his testimony: This case involves accusations of domestic and sexual violence. If you have have been affected by this, or any other issues in this story you canvisit the BBC Action Line. The following post contains allegations of sexual violence Amber Heard is describing an altercation with Depp on a trip to Hicksville, what she describes as a ""fancy trailer park... in the middle of nowhere"". The plan was to have a party in the desert, she says. All was well until a woman they were with suddenly ""leaned
     into me, put her head on my shoulder and put her hand on my arm...I took
     it to be the effects of the drugs"", she says. Members of their group had brought mushrooms and ecstasy. Depp became incensed, Heard says, and began shouting at the woman next to her. ""He grabbed her wrist and said 'do you
     know how many pounds of pressure it takes to break a human wrist,'"" Heard says, becoming increasingly emotional. According to Heard, the two returned to their trailer where the fighting intensified. Looking for his drugs, Depp ""rips my underwear off and then proceeds to do a cavity search"", Heard says, fighting back tears. ""I just stood there."" According to Heard, Depp ""backhanded"" her during an argument about the alleged affairs. ""He wears a lot of rings,"" she says. ""I remember feeling like my lip went into my teeth. It got a little blood on the wall."" The court was also shown a picture - from around March 2013 - that Heard sent to her mother which shows a prominent bruise on her left arm. She says that the bruise was sustained during an argument in which she threw a vase at Depp. ""He grabbed me by the arm and kind of held me on the floor screaming at me,"" she says. During these incidents, Heard explains, she ""didn't make a big deal out of it"" because she was ""so caught up in the relationship"". ""I pride myself on being tough,"" she says.  This video can not be played Depp 'slapped me across the face' over Wino tattoo Heard says that Depp accused her of having affairs during a particularly turbulent time in their relationship in 2013. ""The month got really crazy,"" she says, after he allegedly began drinking spirits again. ""He was accusing me of having affairs,"" she adds, calling it a ""revolving door of accusations"". In one instance, she alleges, a painting she owned - that had been painted by an ex - was seen as evidence of infidelity by Depp. She adds that he tried to burn it, unsuccessfully. ""He wasn't making sense,"" she says. ""He seemed to decide that the painting was an affair he couldn't forgive me for."" The entire month was like a ""never ending fight"" with Depp. All the while, Heard adds, she was ""madly in love"" with him. Heard says Depp started sneaking the drink and drugs ""so I had to look for clues"". ""He'd have this blowout, leave, disappear. I'd be committed to ending the relationship - he'd come back clean and sober and he'd be extra nice and extra apologetic and we'd be good again,"" she says. ""Johnny on speed is very different from Johnny on opioids, Johnny on opioids is very different to Adderall and cocaine Johnny - but I had to get good at paying attention to the different versions of him."" She says Depp's drinking correlated with the violence - adding that she told her therapist about the incidents as well as her mother. Amber Heard is going over instances throughout 2012 when, she says, Johnny Depp was emotionally and physically abusive. ""It would be accusations, accusations and then he would explode,"" she says, and Depp would slap her and ""backhand"" her. I was ""walking on eggshells"", she says, never knowing what she did wrong. Again, Heard describes a cycle: Depp would sober up and return to her repentant, loving and sober. Depp's alleged substance use has been a frequent theme at trial. Heard's team says Depp abused drugs and alcohol throughout the relationship. According to Depp, he was sober for much of their time together, after detoxing from the opioid Oxycodone in 2014. After Depp slapped Heard for the first time, she says, he slapped her again. She lost her balance, she says, and ended up on the carpet. After the incident, Heard says she received calls and texts from Depp apologising. Heard says Depp told her that he ""killed that monster"" and said ""I'll never lay a hand on you again"". Heard says she stayed in the relationship - but Depp started drinking again and began turning up at her house in the middle of the night ""to catch her"" cheating, as well as sending controlling texts. ""He started punching walls next to my head,"" Heard says, adding that the violence would escalate ""to the point he would push me or shove me down"". ""I would get back up and look him in the eye, it was my way of defending myself - he'd ask if we wanted to go again and he'd hit me and shove me down."" This case involves accusations of domestic and sexual violence. If you have have been affected by this, or any other issues in this story you canvisit the BBC Action Line. Heard is now describing the first time she claims Depp hit her. ""I will never forget it - it changed my life,"" she says. ""I was sitting on the couch, we were having a normal conversion, there was no fighting, no nothing. He was drinking and I didn't realise at the time, but I think he was using cocaine, he had a jar of cocaine. ""I asked him about the tattoo he has on his arm, it looked like black marks, I didn't know what it said... and I asked him what it said - he said 'Wino'... ""I laughed because I thought he was joking, and he slapped me across the face..."" She adds: ""And I laughed because I thought 'this must be a joke' - I didn't know what was going on. ""I just stared at him, kind of laughing, still thinking he was going to start laughing and was going to tell me it was a joke. ""He said: 'You think it's funny?'... ""It was clear it wasn't a joke anymore. I stopped laughing but I didn't know what else to do."" After three weeks of trial, we are finally hearing Heard's own allegations of abuse. So far she's described a dream-like affair with Depp in their early days together. Now, she describes when their relationship took a turn, over the course of 2012. Depp would disappear for ""days"", she says, coming back to make disparing, demeaning comments about her. Depp ""would make these comments about whoring myself out, but do so in the context of me acting,"" she says. But then, she says, the Depp she loved came back. ""He would go back to this unbelievably nice, sensitive, kind, generous man,"" she says. ""I would feel so loved."" We heard earlier about the knife Heard bought for Depp - with Depp's lawyer suggesting it showed Heard did not fear Depp. Now, Heard has discussed the knife. She says she visited Depp while he was filming the movie Lone Ranger in the US. She would stay at his accommodation and wait for him to come home and have dinner ready. She says she would take off Depp's boots: ""Anything I could do to show love."" ""Johnny had a thing for turquoise and he loved knives, and when he loves things he does a lot of it,"" she says. ""He'd keep getting me daggers, long curved daggers and talked a lot about his knife and gun collection. ""I picked up a beautiful turquoise handled knife with a saying Johnny would say all the time - 'until death.'"" Heard becomes emotional as she describes the early days of her relationship with Johnny Depp. They had to date in secret because his split - from long time partner Vanessa Paradis - was not yet public, she says. ""It felt like a dream. It felt like absolute magic,"" she says, her voice breaking, describing their days as a ""bubble of secrecy"". Heard describes reconnecting with Johnny Depp a couple of years after filming for the Rum Diary ended, during press promotion for the film. Meeting in Depp's hotel room at the start of the tour, Heard describes an ""instant reconnection"" with her former co-star. ""It felt like there was an electricity,"" she says. ""He grabbed both sides of my face. He kissed me and I kissed him back."" Over the course of the press tour, she says ""we fell in love"". ""It was on, I'll put it that way,"" she says.  This video can not be played Amber Heard testifies: Trial is 'painful and difficult' Heard says she and Depp were in relationships when filming for the Rum Diary started - but shared a ""flirtatious friendship"" on set. ""I felt chemistry, I felt this other thing that went beyond the pale of my job and Johnny clearly felt that way too,"" Heard says. ""But I remember feeling intimated and nervous about that so we went our separate ways and I didn't hear from him for a long time."" She says she next heard from Depp when he called her to invite her to his Beverly Hills home, with the Rum Diary director, to talk about the movie . ""But it was clearly not about the movie,"" Heard adds. ""So I said my friends were in town, I hung up and felt startled. I didn't know what to do."" She said Depp sent her numerous gifts after filming wrapped - including a dress she wore in the movie, expensive collectable books, and some guitars - adding that she rejected the gifts on two occasions.

"Local elections will be held across the UK on 5 May Party leaders are making their pitch to voters on the last day of campaigning ahead of local elections across the UK. The leaders are visiting key electoral battlegrounds before voters go to the polls on Thursday. Voters will elect councils which run services in England, Wales and Scotland, and the government in Northern Ireland. The elections will test support for parties locally and may indicate the mood on national issues. The elections will give party leaders their first opportunity to woo voters since the war in Ukraine began, and the row over parties held in Downing Street during lockdown, and increases to the cost of living. The rising cost of living has been a prominent topic of debate, with inflation at a 30-year high of 7%, driven upwards by surging food and energy prices. Why are prices rising so quickly? Cost of living dominates in key election battleground What are political parties in England hoping for? Speaking on a visit to Southampton Airport, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said his government wants to ""help people in any way we can through the aftershocks of Covid"". He said his ministers were helping people ""in the immediate term"", citing the Â£9.1bn energy rebate package, as well as cold weather payments. Mr Johnson dismissed the idea of a windfall tax on energy companies arguing that they should instead invest their profits in producing ""more green energy to keep costs down"". He said that would be better than ""clobbering"" the companies with an extra tax. This video can not be played PM: The government does not have âan unlimited number of shots to playâ when dealing with the cost of living. In an interview with ITV's Good Morning Britain, Labour leader Keir Starmer said the government had not done enough to alleviate the pressure on budgets. He said April's rise in National Insurance was ""the wrong tax at the wrong time"" and said Labour would have imposed a windfall tax on the profits of oil and gas companies to ease living costs. Speaking ahead of a a visit to Wakefield, Sir Keir accused the Conservatives of ""doing nothing"" to help with rising energy and food costs. He said: ""The Conservatives...have made it worse by imposing 15 Tory tax rises - including this month's national insurance rise on business and working people. ""Labour's plan to tackle the cost-of-living crisis puts money back in your pocket. Our call for an emergency budget would mean action now."" Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said he would target voters in the ""squeezed middle"" when he visited areas where the Conservatives have traditionally done well, in parts of London and south-east England. This video can not be played Sir Ed Davey: ""Some people are really upset with a prime minister who is not a decent man."" Sir Ed said the elections are a ""chance to send a shockwave from communities around the country to the heart of the Conservative Party"". ""Boris Johnson is not fit to lead the country and he needs to go. At this time of national crisis, we can't afford to have a law-breaking prime minister and a tax-hiking chancellor,"" he said. In a column for the Evening Standard, Green Party co-leader Carla Denyer said the main parties were ""chronically failing to deal with the problems we face"". She said her party had a ""better plan"", which included investing Â£25bn per year in insulating homes to reduce energy costs and restoring a Â£20 uplift to Universal Credit benefits payments. SNP leader and Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said backing her party on Thursday would ""put Boris Johnson under real pressure to act now and help families out"". She said the Conservatives have ""run out of excuses for their negligent inaction on their self-made cost-of-living crisis that is hammering families across Scotland"". ""The only thing that will make the Tories sit up and take notice is when they think their own jobs are on the line - and that's why this election is so important,"" she said. In Wales, where all 22 councils are up for election on Thursday, Plaid Cymru promised to tackle and housing crisis and offer free childcare for two-year-olds, among other campaign pledges. ""On Thursday, a vote for a local voice committed to making a difference,"" Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price tweeted. POSTCODE SEARCH:Is there an election in my area?

"Actress Amber Heard takes the stand in the defamation trial with her ex-husband Johnny Depp After describing the romance of their early relationship, she alleges abuse 'It would be accusations, accusations, and then he would explode,' she alleges Depp sued Heard for $50m (Â£40m) over a Washington Post article, where she claimed she was an abuse victim Heard then counter-sued Depp for $100m Depp has given evidence already - the trial has heard accusations of violence on both sides In his testimony, he denied ever striking a woman Warning: This page contains accusations of physical and verbal abuse You can visit bbc.co.uk/actionline for support By Holly Honderich, Emily McGarvey, and Owen Amos It's now past 5pm in the US, Amber Heard has finished her evidence, and the day's hearings are over. Thanks for reading our live coverage. A reminder that if you have been affected by today's hearing, you can visitthe BBC Action Line. Heard now alleges Depp became violent during a flight to Russia, in which he convinced a flight attendant to do drugs with the couple. According to Heard, Depp became heated when the flight attendant became ""MDMA friendly"". ""After all, she's on drugs,"" she says, adding that Depp grabbed the flight attendant's arm in a fit of jealousy. ""He grabbed her by the wrist and slammed it down on the table, and told her he could break her wrist,"" Heard adds. ""These things would happen."" Depp later accused Heard of having caused the incident, Heard adds. Once in Russia, Heard says an argument about the drug-induced incident on the flight eventually turned violent, with Depp allegedly shoving her into a glass table and striking her in the face. Heard says that by mid-2013, she was torn by feelings that Depp was ""the love of my life"" and also an ""awful thing"". ""When it was good, it was so good,"" Depp says. ""I'd never felt love like that. I felt like he recognised me and I recognised him."" However, Heard says that Depp often became ""this other thing"". ""This other thing was awful,"" she adds. ""It would come out and take over and you couldn't see the Johnny I loved."" Heard also alleges that ""no one was honest"" with Depp about the extent of his drug and alcohol issues. ""He'd pass out in his own vomit. He'd lose control of his own body,"" she says. ""Then he'd walk around saying he didn't have a problem."" Today, the court is hearing from Amber Heard. It previously heard from Johnny Depp. A reminder of some of his testimony: This case involves accusations of domestic and sexual violence. If you have have been affected by this, or any other issues in this story you canvisit the BBC Action Line. The following post contains allegations of sexual violence Amber Heard is describing an altercation with Depp on a trip to Hicksville, what she describes as a ""fancy trailer park... in the middle of nowhere"". The plan was to have a party in the desert, she says. All was well until a woman they were with suddenly ""leaned
     into me, put her head on my shoulder and put her hand on my arm...I took
     it to be the effects of the drugs"", she says. Members of their group had brought mushrooms and ecstasy. Depp became incensed, Heard says, and began shouting at the woman next to her. ""He grabbed her wrist and said 'do you
     know how many pounds of pressure it takes to break a human wrist,'"" Heard says, becoming increasingly emotional. According to Heard, the two returned to their trailer where the fighting intensified. Looking for his drugs, Depp ""rips my underwear off and then proceeds to do a cavity search"", Heard says, fighting back tears. ""I just stood there."" According to Heard, Depp ""backhanded"" her during an argument about the alleged affairs. ""He wears a lot of rings,"" she says. ""I remember feeling like my lip went into my teeth. It got a little blood on the wall."" The court was also shown a picture - from around March 2013 - that Heard sent to her mother which shows a prominent bruise on her left arm. She says that the bruise was sustained during an argument in which she threw a vase at Depp. ""He grabbed me by the arm and kind of held me on the floor screaming at me,"" she says. During these incidents, Heard explains, she ""didn't make a big deal out of it"" because she was ""so caught up in the relationship"". ""I pride myself on being tough,"" she says.  This video can not be played Depp 'slapped me across the face' over Wino tattoo Heard says that Depp accused her of having affairs during a particularly turbulent time in their relationship in 2013. ""The month got really crazy,"" she says, after he allegedly began drinking spirits again. ""He was accusing me of having affairs,"" she adds, calling it a ""revolving door of accusations"". In one instance, she alleges, a painting she owned - that had been painted by an ex - was seen as evidence of infidelity by Depp. She adds that he tried to burn it, unsuccessfully. ""He wasn't making sense,"" she says. ""He seemed to decide that the painting was an affair he couldn't forgive me for."" The entire month was like a ""never ending fight"" with Depp. All the while, Heard adds, she was ""madly in love"" with him. Heard says Depp started sneaking the drink and drugs ""so I had to look for clues"". ""He'd have this blowout, leave, disappear. I'd be committed to ending the relationship - he'd come back clean and sober and he'd be extra nice and extra apologetic and we'd be good again,"" she says. ""Johnny on speed is very different from Johnny on opioids, Johnny on opioids is very different to Adderall and cocaine Johnny - but I had to get good at paying attention to the different versions of him."" She says Depp's drinking correlated with the violence - adding that she told her therapist about the incidents as well as her mother. Amber Heard is going over instances throughout 2012 when, she says, Johnny Depp was emotionally and physically abusive. ""It would be accusations, accusations and then he would explode,"" she says, and Depp would slap her and ""backhand"" her. I was ""walking on eggshells"", she says, never knowing what she did wrong. Again, Heard describes a cycle: Depp would sober up and return to her repentant, loving and sober. Depp's alleged substance use has been a frequent theme at trial. Heard's team says Depp abused drugs and alcohol throughout the relationship. According to Depp, he was sober for much of their time together, after detoxing from the opioid Oxycodone in 2014. After Depp slapped Heard for the first time, she says, he slapped her again. She lost her balance, she says, and ended up on the carpet. After the incident, Heard says she received calls and texts from Depp apologising. Heard says Depp told her that he ""killed that monster"" and said ""I'll never lay a hand on you again"". Heard says she stayed in the relationship - but Depp started drinking again and began turning up at her house in the middle of the night ""to catch her"" cheating, as well as sending controlling texts. ""He started punching walls next to my head,"" Heard says, adding that the violence would escalate ""to the point he would push me or shove me down"". ""I would get back up and look him in the eye, it was my way of defending myself - he'd ask if we wanted to go again and he'd hit me and shove me down."" This case involves accusations of domestic and sexual violence. If you have have been affected by this, or any other issues in this story you canvisit the BBC Action Line. Heard is now describing the first time she claims Depp hit her. ""I will never forget it - it changed my life,"" she says. ""I was sitting on the couch, we were having a normal conversion, there was no fighting, no nothing. He was drinking and I didn't realise at the time, but I think he was using cocaine, he had a jar of cocaine. ""I asked him about the tattoo he has on his arm, it looked like black marks, I didn't know what it said... and I asked him what it said - he said 'Wino'... ""I laughed because I thought he was joking, and he slapped me across the face..."" She adds: ""And I laughed because I thought 'this must be a joke' - I didn't know what was going on. ""I just stared at him, kind of laughing, still thinking he was going to start laughing and was going to tell me it was a joke. ""He said: 'You think it's funny?'... ""It was clear it wasn't a joke anymore. I stopped laughing but I didn't know what else to do."" After three weeks of trial, we are finally hearing Heard's own allegations of abuse. So far she's described a dream-like affair with Depp in their early days together. Now, she describes when their relationship took a turn, over the course of 2012. Depp would disappear for ""days"", she says, coming back to make disparing, demeaning comments about her. Depp ""would make these comments about whoring myself out, but do so in the context of me acting,"" she says. But then, she says, the Depp she loved came back. ""He would go back to this unbelievably nice, sensitive, kind, generous man,"" she says. ""I would feel so loved."" We heard earlier about the knife Heard bought for Depp - with Depp's lawyer suggesting it showed Heard did not fear Depp. Now, Heard has discussed the knife. She says she visited Depp while he was filming the movie Lone Ranger in the US. She would stay at his accommodation and wait for him to come home and have dinner ready. She says she would take off Depp's boots: ""Anything I could do to show love."" ""Johnny had a thing for turquoise and he loved knives, and when he loves things he does a lot of it,"" she says. ""He'd keep getting me daggers, long curved daggers and talked a lot about his knife and gun collection. ""I picked up a beautiful turquoise handled knife with a saying Johnny would say all the time - 'until death.'"" Heard becomes emotional as she describes the early days of her relationship with Johnny Depp. They had to date in secret because his split - from long time partner Vanessa Paradis - was not yet public, she says. ""It felt like a dream. It felt like absolute magic,"" she says, her voice breaking, describing their days as a ""bubble of secrecy"". Heard describes reconnecting with Johnny Depp a couple of years after filming for the Rum Diary ended, during press promotion for the film. Meeting in Depp's hotel room at the start of the tour, Heard describes an ""instant reconnection"" with her former co-star. ""It felt like there was an electricity,"" she says. ""He grabbed both sides of my face. He kissed me and I kissed him back."" Over the course of the press tour, she says ""we fell in love"". ""It was on, I'll put it that way,"" she says.  This video can not be played Amber Heard testifies: Trial is 'painful and difficult' Heard says she and Depp were in relationships when filming for the Rum Diary started - but shared a ""flirtatious friendship"" on set. ""I felt chemistry, I felt this other thing that went beyond the pale of my job and Johnny clearly felt that way too,"" Heard says. ""But I remember feeling intimated and nervous about that so we went our separate ways and I didn't hear from him for a long time."" She says she next heard from Depp when he called her to invite her to his Beverly Hills home, with the Rum Diary director, to talk about the movie . ""But it was clearly not about the movie,"" Heard adds. ""So I said my friends were in town, I hung up and felt startled. I didn't know what to do."" She said Depp sent her numerous gifts after filming wrapped - including a dress she wore in the movie, expensive collectable books, and some guitars - adding that she rejected the gifts on two occasions.

"Boohoo's profits have taken a hit after online shoppers returned clothes at a faster rate than before the pandemic. The fast-fashion brand's profits before tax slumped by 94% to Â£7.8m in the year to the end of February. Its sales are still well above pre-Covid levels after high streets closed and shoppers turned to ordering online. But since restrictions were lifted customers have flocked back to physical stores and Boohoo says its online shoppers are sending more items back. Overall, Boohoo's sales rose 14% on the year to Â£2bn. But it warned that challenges caused by the pandemic, including rising shipping costs and overseas delivery delays, would continue this year. Boohoo's brands include BoohooMAN, Karen Millen, Nasty Gal, PrettyLittleThing, Coast, Misspap, Oasis, Warehouse, Burton, Wallis, Dorothy Perkins and Debenhams. âGoing outâ gear out and athleisure in for Boohoo Boohoo boss: 'We're not a throwaway fashion brand' Five things you didn't know about Boohoo For online fashion retailers, returns can be a major headache and a sign that business is not booming. Wednesday's news of a collapse in Boohoo's profitssent shares down by more than 15%. The easing of lockdown restrictions has led to customers going out more and return rates have been rising. Boohoo said customers had returned items faster than expected in the second half of the year, with the rate now higher than it was before the pandemic. As shopping habits change following the pandemic, the rising cost of living is also hitting consumer spending,according to official data. The prices of items in shops has seen the highest increase in more than a decade. Shop prices were up 2.7% year-on-year in April, the highest since September 2011 and up from 2.1% in March, according to the British Retail Consortium. Julie Palmer, a partner at corporate restructuring firm Begbies Traynor, said that given rising costs, people may hold back on clothes shopping. ""The outlook isn't pretty, with inflation a real concern,"" she said. ""Boohoo is going to have to come up with some new looks if it is going to stay relevant as it doesn't take long for consumers to shop around for faster, more relevant alternatives these days."" Boohoo said that lockdowns in some of the key countries it sells in, like China, meant people were not buying as many clothes. International delivery delays due to Covid also caused issues in getting stock from factories and out to customers. The company said it expects these pandemic-related issues ""will continue for the year ahead"". To combat these problems, Boohoo said it was making its supply chain more flexible, its delivery network larger and investing in a new distribution hub in the US. But its clothes could start to cost more with the company only committing to ""mitigate where possible before passing prices on to consumers"". Are you returning clothes more often?

"Dave Chappelle was performing at the Netflix Is A Joke Festival A man has been charged with felony assault with a deadly weapon after an on-stage attack on US comedian Dave Chappelle. The suspect pointed a replica handgun that contained a knife blade at Chappelle, a spokeswoman for the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) said. Chappelle was unharmed, but the suspect has been taken to a local hospital for medical treatment. The incident took place while Chappelle was performing at the Hollywood Bowl. Clips shared on social media,externalshowed someone charging into the star during his set at the Netflix Is A Joke Festival on Tuesday. The LAPD spokeswoman said: ""A famous comedian was performing at the Hollywood Bowl and when he finished his act a male jumped on to the stage and tackled the celebrity. ""The suspect produced a replica handgun and pointed the item at the victim. He was taken into custody and was arrested for assault with a deadly weapon."" The LAPD identified the suspect as 23-year-old Isaiah Lee, who is being held in jail on a $30,000 (Â£24,000) bond. Last year, Chappelle faced criticism and protests when his Netflix special was accused of being transphobic.

"Destiny makes crafts to sell while she is homeschooled by her mum Elina Starting school around lunchtime, learning geography and sometimes doing crafts all day make Destiny's day different to most. The 14-year-old is one of an estimated 90,000 UK children being home educated and she said it makes her ""feel free"". Destiny, who is autistic, makes and sells toys for cats for her online Etsy shop while studying for her GCSEs. It comes as data suggests the number of children being homeschooled in Wales has almost trebled in five years. Campaigners said Covid lockdowns have been an inspiration for some parents to home educate their children. I should be home-schooled, but I spent 10 months on Xbox Rogue heads 'talk parents into homeschooling' Why I home-educate my daughter Now the Welsh government plans to ""strengthen"" guidance to ensure learners children get a ""suitable education"" while ""wellbeing needs are met"". Destiny has been making toys for cats to sell online in classes with her mum For skateboarding YouTuber Destiny, being taught at home has made a ""massive difference"" to her confidence and mental health. ""I do different subjects and sometimes I can pick my own subject,"" said Destiny, who has been educated by mum Elina at their Carmarthenshire home since she was seven. Destiny enjoys geography lessons as well as learning creative skills ""Say for that day I just want to learn about geography, I do that. ""I tend to try and start at around 10am, or lunchtime, because it gives me time to wake up and to do my morning routine and do a journal. ""Every day is completely different. Even if I don't want to sit down and write up something, mum would give me options to either go outside and look at the birds or look up something and watch a documentary. ""I can play some relaxing music. I can fidget. I can bring teddies to school if I want to,"" Destiny, from Llanelli, told theBBC's Wales Live programme. While education is compulsory across the UK, going to school is not. While you do not have to follow the national curriculum, it is a parent's responsibility to ensure what is taught is helping a child to learn. The Education Act 1996 states a child must get an efficient and suitable full-time education for their age, ability and aptitude. Parents or carers who decide to educate their child at home may feel they are better able to meet their child's individual needs and learning style than a school - and guardians do not need to be a teacher or have any qualifications. People may be influenced by philosophical, spiritual or religious beliefs if they decide to home-school their children but will get no funding. Homeschooled children do not have to stick to a school-style timetable or follow school terms. Local education authorities will take action,externalif it appears parents are not providing a suitable education. There are no exact figures on how many UK children are home schooled full-time because there is no requirement for families to inform the local authority, unless the child is removed from school. BBC research last year found thenumber of UK children registering for home educationhad risen 75% and estimates show about 90,000 children are schooled at home. Parents and children can decide what different subjects are taught at home Latest figures show81,000 children are homeschooled in England,external,more than 5,000 in Scotland,external, about500 in Northern Ireland,externaland more than 3,500 in Wales. For context, there were fewer than 900 children identified as having their education at home a decade ago in Wales but now that number is now an estimated 3,540 - up from 3,273 the year before. Destiny lives in Carmarthenshire where the most homeschooled children in Wales live Carmarthenshire, where Destiny lives, has the highest numbers of home-educated pupils - 402, up from 284 two years earlier - while Ceredigion has the highest rate of homeschooled pupils at 32.1 per 1,000 children. Council figures obtained by Wales Live suggest the number of children recorded as home educated has almost trebled in the past five years. Although, figures may be inflated due to greater attempts from councils to find and record families who have opted against school. Destiny has been taught at home since leaving school aged seven where she became ""overwhelmed"". ""I did learn quite a lot of stuff, but it was very hard because when I got home I would always have a meltdown and cry,"" she said. Destiny says she has fewer friends than the people she knows who go to school, but she does not necessarily see that as a bad thing. ""If I had to go to school, I think my confidence would be put down a lot,"" she said. Destiny concentrates on lessons that inspire her during homeschool lessons "" A lot of people get bullied now and it gets worse, especially with social media. There's always a competition. You've always got to dress a certain way. ""There are tons of rules in school and I think I wouldn't be able to cope now if I did go."" But graphic designer Elina said home education has also had its challenges and can be ""scary"" and ""stressful"", especially as a single parent. Mum Elina has been homeschooling daughter Destiny since she was seven ""My work life completely changed, because I was a single mum, I had to become self-employed and stop the job I was doing,"" the 40-year-old said. ""It's been like a rollercoaster - we've had really good periods and really difficult periods. ""Financially it can be very stressful because I had to pay for everything to do with her education."" Some home educators said their community had seen a ""big influx"" since the pandemic. ""I think that Covid particularly has given people a taster, they've dipped their toe in the water and found their child thrived,"" said Wendy Charles-Warner, chair of home education group, Education Otherwise. ""We have now lost the children from home education who perhaps should never have been home educated, the ones whose parents came to it through fear, through wanting to withhold their child from school until they felt it was safe."" The Welsh government said numbers of homeschooled children had increased during the pandemic, but it hoped learners could return to school if it was in their best interest. Welsh government is spending Â£1.7 million this year for home educated learners ""We are developing proposals that will strengthen the existing guidance on elective home education, to help ensure home educated children receive a suitable education and their wellbeing needs are met,"" said a spokesperson. The Welsh government said it will spend Â£1.7m on education resources and activities for home educated learners. ""The pandemic has highlighted the importance of ensuring that the support system for all children and young people, including those being home educated, is as effective as possible,"" the spokesperson added. Plaid Cymru said new laws were needed to protect home educated children, while the Welsh Conservatives better support was needed to ensure those learning from home received a ""top quality education"".

"This video can not be played Dr Alex George said the house his parents live in has an outbuilding that has been converted to four cottages A former Love Island contestant said he was still planning on going ahead with his ""renovation journey"" despite receiving online abuse. Dr Alex George, 31, said his family had ""every right"" to run a business as others do in the area. Some people had voiced concerns that home were being taken away from locals in an already squeezed market. But he said it was a ""classic case of people interpreting things when they don't know the full picture"". Rising house prices see old ruin turned into home What's Wales' problem with second homes? The social media influencer added that most people are ""incredibly supportive"" and see his situation for what it is. Dr George announced on Instagram earlier this year he had purchasedfour holiday homes in Pembrokeshire. Allow Instagram content? This article contains content provided by Instagram.

He said: ""In this situation, a house that my parents live in that has an outbuilding that has been converted to four attached cottages, I think it's a very different situation to what people understand. ""My parents have every right to run a business as every other Airbnb or hotel in the region does as well."" He added he had spoken with residents and many who understand the situation and were quite surprised at the backlash. ""We're not developers buying swathes of land and converting it into holiday homes, that's just not the case quite frankly."" Dr George (far right) was on Love Island in 2018 Speaking onBBC Radio Wales Breakfast, Dr Alex said: ""People can be very angry about things, and I think in this situation it was probably aimed in the wrong direction. ""If you want to change things like legislation or support the local housing authority, then you should speak to local leaders."" He added he is from the area and has three or four generations of his family there. ""Lots of my family are builders, or work in that area, and clearly there are issues with housing, but ultimately we need to look at solutions that include building more houses, or making more affordable houses available."" Describing the houses as ""relaxing spaces for families to holiday and enjoy the Welsh countryside,"" he suggested three of them would be used for short-term rentals and the fourth for a Ukrainian family. He said he was working to get one of the properties ready for a family fleeing the conflict in Ukraine. ""It will be nice to do something to help other people,"" he added. One Welsh language campaign group, Cymdeithas yr Iaith said the housing market was the problem and there needed to be legislation to ensure a home for everyone. They added that holiday homes were depriving local people of a home and threatening the future of communities. Jeff Smith, chair of Cymdeithas yr Iaith's sustainable communities group, said: ""Second homes are only part of the housing problem. House prices are beyond the reach of local people so they have to move away, it's a worry that anyone can buy a holiday home, let alone four holiday homes. ""House prices, to buy and rent, are a problem across Wales and measures need to be introduced so that local people are prioritised, to ensure local people have the right to a home and to manage the renting sector."" The Housing Justice Charter wants housing policy to be rethought. A spokesman said: ""Property speculation in large areas in Wales is contributing to escalating housing costs. ""We have over 4,000 second homes in Pembrokeshire alone. That is not including holiday lets. ""We have over 5,000 people on the housing register. The dysfunctional housing market is excluding local people from both renting and buying."" TV star faces online abuse over holiday cottages My holiday homes will celebrate the area - Dr Alex.

"Boohoo's profits have taken a hit after online shoppers returned clothes at a faster rate than before the pandemic. The fast-fashion brand's profits before tax slumped by 94% to Â£7.8m in the year to the end of February. Its sales are still well above pre-Covid levels after high streets closed and shoppers turned to ordering online. But since restrictions were lifted customers have flocked back to physical stores and Boohoo says its online shoppers are sending more items back. Overall, Boohoo's sales rose 14% on the year to Â£2bn. But it warned that challenges caused by the pandemic, including rising shipping costs and overseas delivery delays, would continue this year. Boohoo's brands include BoohooMAN, Karen Millen, Nasty Gal, PrettyLittleThing, Coast, Misspap, Oasis, Warehouse, Burton, Wallis, Dorothy Perkins and Debenhams. âGoing outâ gear out and athleisure in for Boohoo Boohoo boss: 'We're not a throwaway fashion brand' Five things you didn't know about Boohoo For online fashion retailers, returns can be a major headache and a sign that business is not booming. Wednesday's news of a collapse in Boohoo's profitssent shares down by more than 15%. The easing of lockdown restrictions has led to customers going out more and return rates have been rising. Boohoo said customers had returned items faster than expected in the second half of the year, with the rate now higher than it was before the pandemic. As shopping habits change following the pandemic, the rising cost of living is also hitting consumer spending,according to official data. The prices of items in shops has seen the highest increase in more than a decade. Shop prices were up 2.7% year-on-year in April, the highest since September 2011 and up from 2.1% in March, according to the British Retail Consortium. Julie Palmer, a partner at corporate restructuring firm Begbies Traynor, said that given rising costs, people may hold back on clothes shopping. ""The outlook isn't pretty, with inflation a real concern,"" she said. ""Boohoo is going to have to come up with some new looks if it is going to stay relevant as it doesn't take long for consumers to shop around for faster, more relevant alternatives these days."" Boohoo said that lockdowns in some of the key countries it sells in, like China, meant people were not buying as many clothes. International delivery delays due to Covid also caused issues in getting stock from factories and out to customers. The company said it expects these pandemic-related issues ""will continue for the year ahead"". To combat these problems, Boohoo said it was making its supply chain more flexible, its delivery network larger and investing in a new distribution hub in the US. But its clothes could start to cost more with the company only committing to ""mitigate where possible before passing prices on to consumers"". Are you returning clothes more often?

"Dave Chappelle was performing at the Netflix Is A Joke Festival A man has been charged with felony assault with a deadly weapon after an on-stage attack on US comedian Dave Chappelle. The suspect pointed a replica handgun that contained a knife blade at Chappelle, a spokeswoman for the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) said. Chappelle was unharmed, but the suspect has been taken to a local hospital for medical treatment. The incident took place while Chappelle was performing at the Hollywood Bowl. Clips shared on social media,externalshowed someone charging into the star during his set at the Netflix Is A Joke Festival on Tuesday. The LAPD spokeswoman said: ""A famous comedian was performing at the Hollywood Bowl and when he finished his act a male jumped on to the stage and tackled the celebrity. ""The suspect produced a replica handgun and pointed the item at the victim. He was taken into custody and was arrested for assault with a deadly weapon."" The LAPD identified the suspect as 23-year-old Isaiah Lee, who is being held in jail on a $30,000 (Â£24,000) bond. Last year, Chappelle faced criticism and protests when his Netflix special was accused of being transphobic. After returning to the stage on Tuesday, the 48-year-old appeared to make light of the controversy, suggesting to the audience that the attacker ""was a trans man"". According to ABC journalist Stephanie Wash, fellow comic Chris Rock - who was slapped on stage by Will Smith at the Oscars in March - then came on stage with Chappelle. Allow Twitter content?

Carpenter told the PA news agency an attacker ""lunged"" at the comedian as he headlined the event, sending him ""flying in the air"". She said: ""It looked like someone was dashing across the stage from the side. He fell backwards on to his back, with his arms and legs up in the air. He was obviously in shock. We were all in shock. ""I thought for a moment OK, is this a prank? Because they had made some Will Smith jokes. Even though Chris Rock was there, Dave was making some jokes, it was fair game, right?"" In one video, Chappelle could be seen thanking his famous friends for helping out, saying: ""Whenever you're in trouble, Jamie Foxx will show up in a sheriff's hat."" ""I thought that was part of the show,"" Foxx responded. Chappelle joked: ""I've been doing this 35 years. I just stomped a [person] backstage. I've always wanted to do that."" Chappelle's spokesperson, Carla Sims, said afterwards: ""As unfortunate and unsettling as the incident was, Chappelle went on with the show, crediting Rock and Foxx with helping to ""calm the crowd."" Jimmy Carr, the British comedian whosparked outrage earlier this year for a routine about the Holocaustin his own Netflix stand-up special, also performed at the streaming giant's event on Tuesday. Carr tweeted afterwards,externalto say the show was ""crazy"" and he was ""just happy everyone's OK"". A spokeswoman for the Hollywood Bowl said an investigation has been launched, telling PA: ""The incident that occurred at the Hollywood Bowl on May 3 2022 is an active investigation and we are unable to comment further at this time."" Dave Chappelle alongside fellow comedian Jerry Seinfeld on Sunday, at a lunchtime event for the Netflix Is A Joke Festival In October, about100 people protested outside Netflix's headquartersover the airing of a comedy special by Chappelle, which they said was transphobic. They had objected to The Closer, in which he said ""gender is a fact"" and that LGBT people were ""too sensitive"". Chappelle later hit backat those who he said wanted to ""cancel"" him. ""To the transgender community, I am more than willing to give you an audience,"" he said. ""But you will not summon me. I am not bending to anybody's demands."" The likes of Seth Rogen, Snoop Dogg, Bill Burr and Pete Davidson are also starring at Netflix's inaugural comedy festival, as well as Jerry Seinfeld and recent Oscars co-host Wanda Sykes.

"Actress Amber Heard takes the stand in the defamation trial with her ex-husband Johnny Depp After describing the romance of their early relationship, she alleges abuse 'It would be accusations, accusations, and then he would explode,' she alleges Depp sued Heard for $50m (Â£40m) over a Washington Post article, where she claimed she was an abuse victim Heard then counter-sued Depp for $100m Depp has given evidence already - the trial has heard accusations of violence on both sides In his testimony, he denied ever striking a woman Warning: This page contains accusations of physical and verbal abuse You can visit bbc.co.uk/actionline for support By Holly Honderich, Emily McGarvey, and Owen Amos It's now past 5pm in the US, Amber Heard has finished her evidence, and the day's hearings are over. Thanks for reading our live coverage. A reminder that if you have been affected by today's hearing, you can visitthe BBC Action Line. Heard now alleges Depp became violent during a flight to Russia, in which he convinced a flight attendant to do drugs with the couple. According to Heard, Depp became heated when the flight attendant became ""MDMA friendly"". ""After all, she's on drugs,"" she says, adding that Depp grabbed the flight attendant's arm in a fit of jealousy. ""He grabbed her by the wrist and slammed it down on the table, and told her he could break her wrist,"" Heard adds. ""These things would happen."" Depp later accused Heard of having caused the incident, Heard adds. Once in Russia, Heard says an argument about the drug-induced incident on the flight eventually turned violent, with Depp allegedly shoving her into a glass table and striking her in the face. Heard says that by mid-2013, she was torn by feelings that Depp was ""the love of my life"" and also an ""awful thing"". ""When it was good, it was so good,"" Depp says. ""I'd never felt love like that. I felt like he recognised me and I recognised him."" However, Heard says that Depp often became ""this other thing"". ""This other thing was awful,"" she adds. ""It would come out and take over and you couldn't see the Johnny I loved."" Heard also alleges that ""no one was honest"" with Depp about the extent of his drug and alcohol issues. ""He'd pass out in his own vomit. He'd lose control of his own body,"" she says. ""Then he'd walk around saying he didn't have a problem."" Today, the court is hearing from Amber Heard. It previously heard from Johnny Depp. A reminder of some of his testimony: This case involves accusations of domestic and sexual violence. If you have have been affected by this, or any other issues in this story you canvisit the BBC Action Line. The following post contains allegations of sexual violence Amber Heard is describing an altercation with Depp on a trip to Hicksville, what she describes as a ""fancy trailer park... in the middle of nowhere"". The plan was to have a party in the desert, she says. All was well until a woman they were with suddenly ""leaned
     into me, put her head on my shoulder and put her hand on my arm...I took
     it to be the effects of the drugs"", she says. Members of their group had brought mushrooms and ecstasy. Depp became incensed, Heard says, and began shouting at the woman next to her. ""He grabbed her wrist and said 'do you
     know how many pounds of pressure it takes to break a human wrist,'"" Heard says, becoming increasingly emotional. According to Heard, the two returned to their trailer where the fighting intensified. Looking for his drugs, Depp ""rips my underwear off and then proceeds to do a cavity search"", Heard says, fighting back tears. ""I just stood there."" According to Heard, Depp ""backhanded"" her during an argument about the alleged affairs. ""He wears a lot of rings,"" she says. ""I remember feeling like my lip went into my teeth. It got a little blood on the wall."" The court was also shown a picture - from around March 2013 - that Heard sent to her mother which shows a prominent bruise on her left arm. She says that the bruise was sustained during an argument in which she threw a vase at Depp. ""He grabbed me by the arm and kind of held me on the floor screaming at me,"" she says. During these incidents, Heard explains, she ""didn't make a big deal out of it"" because she was ""so caught up in the relationship"". ""I pride myself on being tough,"" she says.  This video can not be played Depp 'slapped me across the face' over Wino tattoo Heard says that Depp accused her of having affairs during a particularly turbulent time in their relationship in 2013. ""The month got really crazy,"" she says, after he allegedly began drinking spirits again. ""He was accusing me of having affairs,"" she adds, calling it a ""revolving door of accusations"". In one instance, she alleges, a painting she owned - that had been painted by an ex - was seen as evidence of infidelity by Depp. She adds that he tried to burn it, unsuccessfully. ""He wasn't making sense,"" she says. ""He seemed to decide that the painting was an affair he couldn't forgive me for."" The entire month was like a ""never ending fight"" with Depp. All the while, Heard adds, she was ""madly in love"" with him. Heard says Depp started sneaking the drink and drugs ""so I had to look for clues"". ""He'd have this blowout, leave, disappear. I'd be committed to ending the relationship - he'd come back clean and sober and he'd be extra nice and extra apologetic and we'd be good again,"" she says. ""Johnny on speed is very different from Johnny on opioids, Johnny on opioids is very different to Adderall and cocaine Johnny - but I had to get good at paying attention to the different versions of him."" She says Depp's drinking correlated with the violence - adding that she told her therapist about the incidents as well as her mother. Amber Heard is going over instances throughout 2012 when, she says, Johnny Depp was emotionally and physically abusive. ""It would be accusations, accusations and then he would explode,"" she says, and Depp would slap her and ""backhand"" her. I was ""walking on eggshells"", she says, never knowing what she did wrong. Again, Heard describes a cycle: Depp would sober up and return to her repentant, loving and sober. Depp's alleged substance use has been a frequent theme at trial. Heard's team says Depp abused drugs and alcohol throughout the relationship. According to Depp, he was sober for much of their time together, after detoxing from the opioid Oxycodone in 2014. After Depp slapped Heard for the first time, she says, he slapped her again. She lost her balance, she says, and ended up on the carpet. After the incident, Heard says she received calls and texts from Depp apologising. Heard says Depp told her that he ""killed that monster"" and said ""I'll never lay a hand on you again"". Heard says she stayed in the relationship - but Depp started drinking again and began turning up at her house in the middle of the night ""to catch her"" cheating, as well as sending controlling texts. ""He started punching walls next to my head,"" Heard says, adding that the violence would escalate ""to the point he would push me or shove me down"". ""I would get back up and look him in the eye, it was my way of defending myself - he'd ask if we wanted to go again and he'd hit me and shove me down."" This case involves accusations of domestic and sexual violence. If you have have been affected by this, or any other issues in this story you canvisit the BBC Action Line. Heard is now describing the first time she claims Depp hit her. ""I will never forget it - it changed my life,"" she says. ""I was sitting on the couch, we were having a normal conversion, there was no fighting, no nothing. He was drinking and I didn't realise at the time, but I think he was using cocaine, he had a jar of cocaine. ""I asked him about the tattoo he has on his arm, it looked like black marks, I didn't know what it said... and I asked him what it said - he said 'Wino'... ""I laughed because I thought he was joking, and he slapped me across the face..."" She adds: ""And I laughed because I thought 'this must be a joke' - I didn't know what was going on. ""I just stared at him, kind of laughing, still thinking he was going to start laughing and was going to tell me it was a joke. ""He said: 'You think it's funny?'... ""It was clear it wasn't a joke anymore. I stopped laughing but I didn't know what else to do."" After three weeks of trial, we are finally hearing Heard's own allegations of abuse. So far she's described a dream-like affair with Depp in their early days together. Now, she describes when their relationship took a turn, over the course of 2012. Depp would disappear for ""days"", she says, coming back to make disparing, demeaning comments about her. Depp ""would make these comments about whoring myself out, but do so in the context of me acting,"" she says. But then, she says, the Depp she loved came back. ""He would go back to this unbelievably nice, sensitive, kind, generous man,"" she says. ""I would feel so loved."" We heard earlier about the knife Heard bought for Depp - with Depp's lawyer suggesting it showed Heard did not fear Depp. Now, Heard has discussed the knife. She says she visited Depp while he was filming the movie Lone Ranger in the US. She would stay at his accommodation and wait for him to come home and have dinner ready. She says she would take off Depp's boots: ""Anything I could do to show love."" ""Johnny had a thing for turquoise and he loved knives, and when he loves things he does a lot of it,"" she says. ""He'd keep getting me daggers, long curved daggers and talked a lot about his knife and gun collection. ""I picked up a beautiful turquoise handled knife with a saying Johnny would say all the time - 'until death.'"" Heard becomes emotional as she describes the early days of her relationship with Johnny Depp. They had to date in secret because his split - from long time partner Vanessa Paradis - was not yet public, she says. ""It felt like a dream. It felt like absolute magic,"" she says, her voice breaking, describing their days as a ""bubble of secrecy"". Heard describes reconnecting with Johnny Depp a couple of years after filming for the Rum Diary ended, during press promotion for the film. Meeting in Depp's hotel room at the start of the tour, Heard describes an ""instant reconnection"" with her former co-star. ""It felt like there was an electricity,"" she says. ""He grabbed both sides of my face. He kissed me and I kissed him back."" Over the course of the press tour, she says ""we fell in love"". ""It was on, I'll put it that way,"" she says.  This video can not be played Amber Heard testifies: Trial is 'painful and difficult' Heard says she and Depp were in relationships when filming for the Rum Diary started - but shared a ""flirtatious friendship"" on set. ""I felt chemistry, I felt this other thing that went beyond the pale of my job and Johnny clearly felt that way too,"" Heard says. ""But I remember feeling intimated and nervous about that so we went our separate ways and I didn't hear from him for a long time."" She says she next heard from Depp when he called her to invite her to his Beverly Hills home, with the Rum Diary director, to talk about the movie . ""But it was clearly not about the movie,"" Heard adds. ""So I said my friends were in town, I hung up and felt startled. I didn't know what to do."" She said Depp sent her numerous gifts after filming wrapped - including a dress she wore in the movie, expensive collectable books, and some guitars - adding that she rejected the gifts on two occasions.

"This video can not be played A tribute to an elf named Dobby sits above National Trust-run Freshwater West beach He is one of the most beloved characters in Harry Potter books and films, but could the ""resting place"" of Dobby the House Elf be removed? A grave paying tribute to Dobby sits above Freshwater West beach in Pembrokeshire, where the character's death was filmed. Now, asurvey commissioned by National Trust,externalhas asked for opinions on whether the grave should stay or go. National Trust Wales said the area had come under more pressure recently. Valley-wood: How Hollywood has come to Wales Rare Harry Potter bought for 50p sells for Â£15k Quidditch could be renamed after Rowling trans row Dobby was one of the most popular characters in the Harry Potter franchise The survey asks 30 questions about Freshwater West, which is managed by National Trust, including some about traffic, parking and toilet facilities in the area. It also asks two questions about Dobby's grave, asking whether it should be removed or transferred to a ""suitable publicly accessible location off-site"". The grave mainly consists of pebbles with messages to the house elf, portrayed by Toby Jones in the film series, but socks are also said to be left at the site. In the franchise, house elves are only freed from servitude if they are given clothes. In the second instalment, the Chamber of Secrets, Harry Potter ensures Dobby is given a sock by his owners, the Malfoy family. Stones and socks are piled up at Freshwater West in tribute to Dobby Victoria MacLean, a Harry Potter fan from Neath, toldBBC Radio Wales Breakfastthere should be a compromise as to what is left at the grave, but said another tribute would soon be constructed there if it was moved. She said: ""Leaving a fresh sock is lovely but after a while that sock probably gets covered in all sorts and I can understand the socks. ""But the pebbles, some people have gone to great lengths to paint some of those pebbles, just to leave something in memorial to one of their favourite characters and it is so beautiful to see.

""There needs to be something that will please the fans yet keep the beach looking beautiful because it is a stunning beach."" The survey is open until 31 May. Toby Jones voiced Dobby in several Harry Potter films National Trust Wales said: ""Over the past few years we have seen an increase in visitors wanting to experience all that Freshwater West has to offer, including its beautiful beach."" ""We love welcoming people to the site, but the increase in numbers does mean its facilities and infrastructure are under even more pressure. We want visitors to have an enjoyable, safe experience while ensuring this special landscape is looked after for future generations. ""A survey is now under way to help us understand the issues in more depth and to consider options for a sustainable future for Freshwater West, which includes the memorial to Dobby.

Heard says she stayed in the relationship - but Depp started drinking again and began turning up at her house in the middle of the night ""to catch her"" cheating, as well as sending controlling texts. ""He started punching walls next to my head,"" Heard says, adding that the violence would escalate ""to the point he would push me or shove me down"". ""I would get back up and look him in the eye, it was my way of defending myself - he'd ask if we wanted to go again and he'd hit me and shove me down."" This case involves accusations of domestic and sexual violence. If you have have been affected by this, or any other issues in this story you canvisit the BBC Action Line. Heard is now describing the first time she claims Depp hit her. ""I will never forget it - it changed my life,"" she says. ""I was sitting on the couch, we were having a normal conversion, there was no fighting, no nothing. He was drinking and I didn't realise at the time, but I think he was using cocaine, he had a jar of cocaine. ""I asked him about the tattoo he has on his arm, it looked like black marks, I didn't know what it said... and I asked him what it said - he said 'Wino'... ""I laughed because I thought he was joking, and he slapped me across the face..."" She adds: ""And I laughed because I thought 'this must be a joke' - I didn't know what was going on. ""I just stared at him, kind of laughing, still thinking he was going to start laughing and was going to tell me it was a joke. ""He said: 'You think it's funny?'... ""It was clear it wasn't a joke anymore. I stopped laughing but I didn't know what else to do."" After three weeks of trial, we are finally hearing Heard's own allegations of abuse. So far she's described a dream-like affair with Depp in their early days together. Now, she describes when their relationship took a turn, over the course of 2012. Depp would disappear for ""days"", she says, coming back to make disparing, demeaning comments about her. Depp ""would make these comments about whoring myself out, but do so in the context of me acting,"" she says. But then, she says, the Depp she loved came back. ""He would go back to this unbelievably nice, sensitive, kind, generous man,"" she says. ""I would feel so loved."" We heard earlier about the knife Heard bought for Depp - with Depp's lawyer suggesting it showed Heard did not fear Depp. Now, Heard has discussed the knife. She says she visited Depp while he was filming the movie Lone Ranger in the US. She would stay at his accommodation and wait for him to come home and have dinner ready. She says she would take off Depp's boots: ""Anything I could do to show love."" ""Johnny had a thing for turquoise and he loved knives, and when he loves things he does a lot of it,"" she says. ""He'd keep getting me daggers, long curved daggers and talked a lot about his knife and gun collection. ""I picked up a beautiful turquoise handled knife with a saying Johnny would say all the time - 'until death.'"" Heard becomes emotional as she describes the early days of her relationship with Johnny Depp. They had to date in secret because his split - from long time partner Vanessa Paradis - was not yet public, she says. ""It felt like a dream. It felt like absolute magic,"" she says, her voice breaking, describing their days as a ""bubble of secrecy"". Heard describes reconnecting with Johnny Depp a couple of years after filming for the Rum Diary ended, during press promotion for the film. Meeting in Depp's hotel room at the start of the tour, Heard describes an ""instant reconnection"" with her former co-star. ""It felt like there was an electricity,"" she says. ""He grabbed both sides of my face. He kissed me and I kissed him back."" Over the course of the press tour, she says ""we fell in love"". ""It was on, I'll put it that way,"" she says.  This video can not be played Amber Heard testifies: Trial is 'painful and difficult' Heard says she and Depp were in relationships when filming for the Rum Diary started - but shared a ""flirtatious friendship"" on set. ""I felt chemistry, I felt this other thing that went beyond the pale of my job and Johnny clearly felt that way too,"" Heard says. ""But I remember feeling intimated and nervous about that so we went our separate ways and I didn't hear from him for a long time."" She says she next heard from Depp when he called her to invite her to his Beverly Hills home, with the Rum Diary director, to talk about the movie . ""But it was clearly not about the movie,"" Heard adds. ""So I said my friends were in town, I hung up and felt startled. I didn't know what to do."" She said Depp sent her numerous gifts after filming wrapped - including a dress she wore in the movie, expensive collectable books, and some guitars - adding that she rejected the gifts on two occasions.

"Actress Amber Heard takes the stand in the defamation trial with her ex-husband Johnny Depp After describing the romance of their early relationship, she alleges abuse 'It would be accusations, accusations, and then he would explode,' she alleges Depp sued Heard for $50m (Â£40m) over a Washington Post article, where she claimed she was an abuse victim Heard then counter-sued Depp for $100m Depp has given evidence already - the trial has heard accusations of violence on both sides In his testimony, he denied ever striking a woman Warning: This page contains accusations of physical and verbal abuse You can visit bbc.co.uk/actionline for support By Holly Honderich, Emily McGarvey, and Owen Amos It's now past 5pm in the US, Amber Heard has finished her evidence, and the day's hearings are over. Thanks for reading our live coverage. A reminder that if you have been affected by today's hearing, you can visitthe BBC Action Line. Heard now alleges Depp became violent during a flight to Russia, in which he convinced a flight attendant to do drugs with the couple. According to Heard, Depp became heated when the flight attendant became ""MDMA friendly"". ""After all, she's on drugs,"" she says, adding that Depp grabbed the flight attendant's arm in a fit of jealousy. ""He grabbed her by the wrist and slammed it down on the table, and told her he could break her wrist,"" Heard adds. ""These things would happen."" Depp later accused Heard of having caused the incident, Heard adds. Once in Russia, Heard says an argument about the drug-induced incident on the flight eventually turned violent, with Depp allegedly shoving her into a glass table and striking her in the face. Heard says that by mid-2013, she was torn by feelings that Depp was ""the love of my life"" and also an ""awful thing"". ""When it was good, it was so good,"" Depp says. ""I'd never felt love like that. I felt like he recognised me and I recognised him."" However, Heard says that Depp often became ""this other thing"". ""This other thing was awful,"" she adds. ""It would come out and take over and you couldn't see the Johnny I loved."" Heard also alleges that ""no one was honest"" with Depp about the extent of his drug and alcohol issues. ""He'd pass out in his own vomit. He'd lose control of his own body,"" she says. ""Then he'd walk around saying he didn't have a problem."" Today, the court is hearing from Amber Heard. It previously heard from Johnny Depp. A reminder of some of his testimony: This case involves accusations of domestic and sexual violence. If you have have been affected by this, or any other issues in this story you canvisit the BBC Action Line. The following post contains allegations of sexual violence Amber Heard is describing an altercation with Depp on a trip to Hicksville, what she describes as a ""fancy trailer park... in the middle of nowhere"". The plan was to have a party in the desert, she says. All was well until a woman they were with suddenly ""leaned
     into me, put her head on my shoulder and put her hand on my arm...I took
     it to be the effects of the drugs"", she says. Members of their group had brought mushrooms and ecstasy. Depp became incensed, Heard says, and began shouting at the woman next to her. ""He grabbed her wrist and said 'do you
     know how many pounds of pressure it takes to break a human wrist,'"" Heard says, becoming increasingly emotional. According to Heard, the two returned to their trailer where the fighting intensified. Looking for his drugs, Depp ""rips my underwear off and then proceeds to do a cavity search"", Heard says, fighting back tears. ""I just stood there."" According to Heard, Depp ""backhanded"" her during an argument about the alleged affairs. ""He wears a lot of rings,"" she says. ""I remember feeling like my lip went into my teeth. It got a little blood on the wall."" The court was also shown a picture - from around March 2013 - that Heard sent to her mother which shows a prominent bruise on her left arm. She says that the bruise was sustained during an argument in which she threw a vase at Depp. ""He grabbed me by the arm and kind of held me on the floor screaming at me,"" she says. During these incidents, Heard explains, she ""didn't make a big deal out of it"" because she was ""so caught up in the relationship"". ""I pride myself on being tough,"" she says.  This video can not be played Depp 'slapped me across the face' over Wino tattoo Heard says that Depp accused her of having affairs during a particularly turbulent time in their relationship in 2013. ""The month got really crazy,"" she says, after he allegedly began drinking spirits again. ""He was accusing me of having affairs,"" she adds, calling it a ""revolving door of accusations"". In one instance, she alleges, a painting she owned - that had been painted by an ex - was seen as evidence of infidelity by Depp. She adds that he tried to burn it, unsuccessfully. ""He wasn't making sense,"" she says. ""He seemed to decide that the painting was an affair he couldn't forgive me for."" The entire month was like a ""never ending fight"" with Depp. All the while, Heard adds, she was ""madly in love"" with him. Heard says Depp started sneaking the drink and drugs ""so I had to look for clues"". ""He'd have this blowout, leave, disappear. I'd be committed to ending the relationship - he'd come back clean and sober and he'd be extra nice and extra apologetic and we'd be good again,"" she says. ""Johnny on speed is very different from Johnny on opioids, Johnny on opioids is very different to Adderall and cocaine Johnny - but I had to get good at paying attention to the different versions of him."" She says Depp's drinking correlated with the violence - adding that she told her therapist about the incidents as well as her mother. Amber Heard is going over instances throughout 2012 when, she says, Johnny Depp was emotionally and physically abusive. ""It would be accusations, accusations and then he would explode,"" she says, and Depp would slap her and ""backhand"" her. I was ""walking on eggshells"", she says, never knowing what she did wrong. Again, Heard describes a cycle: Depp would sober up and return to her repentant, loving and sober. Depp's alleged substance use has been a frequent theme at trial. Heard's team says Depp abused drugs and alcohol throughout the relationship. According to Depp, he was sober for much of their time together, after detoxing from the opioid Oxycodone in 2014. After Depp slapped Heard for the first time, she says, he slapped her again. She lost her balance, she says, and ended up on the carpet. After the incident, Heard says she received calls and texts from Depp apologising. Heard says Depp told her that he ""killed that monster"" and said ""I'll never lay a hand on you again"". Heard says she stayed in the relationship - but Depp started drinking again and began turning up at her house in the middle of the night ""to catch her"" cheating, as well as sending controlling texts.

"Dave Chappelle was performing at the Netflix Is A Joke Festival A man has been charged with felony assault with a deadly weapon after an on-stage attack on US comedian Dave Chappelle. The suspect pointed a replica handgun that contained a knife blade at Chappelle, a spokeswoman for the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) said. Chappelle was unharmed, but the suspect has been taken to a local hospital for medical treatment. The incident took place while Chappelle was performing at the Hollywood Bowl. Clips shared on social media,externalshowed someone charging into the star during his set at the Netflix Is A Joke Festival on Tuesday. The LAPD spokeswoman said: ""A famous comedian was performing at the Hollywood Bowl and when he finished his act a male jumped on to the stage and tackled the celebrity. ""The suspect produced a replica handgun and pointed the item at the victim. He was taken into custody and was arrested for assault with a deadly weapon."" The LAPD identified the suspect as 23-year-old Isaiah Lee, who is being held in jail on a $30,000 (Â£24,000) bond. Last year, Chappelle faced criticism and protests when his Netflix special was accused of being transphobic. After returning to the stage on Tuesday, the 48-year-old appeared to make light of the controversy, suggesting to the audience that the attacker ""was a trans man"". According to ABC journalist Stephanie Wash, fellow comic Chris Rock - who was slapped on stage by Will Smith at the Oscars in March - then came on stage with Chappelle. Allow Twitter content?

Carpenter told the PA news agency an attacker ""lunged"" at the comedian as he headlined the event, sending him ""flying in the air"". She said: ""It looked like someone was dashing across the stage from the side. He fell backwards on to his back, with his arms and legs up in the air. He was obviously in shock. We were all in shock. ""I thought for a moment OK, is this a prank? Because they had made some Will Smith jokes. Even though Chris Rock was there, Dave was making some jokes, it was fair game, right?"" In one video, Chappelle could be seen thanking his famous friends for helping out, saying: ""Whenever you're in trouble, Jamie Foxx will show up in a sheriff's hat."" ""I thought that was part of the show,"" Foxx responded. Chappelle joked: ""I've been doing this 35 years. I just stomped a [person] backstage. I've always wanted to do that."" Chappelle's spokesperson, Carla Sims, said afterwards: ""As unfortunate and unsettling as the incident was, Chappelle went on with the show, crediting Rock and Foxx with helping to ""calm the crowd."" Jimmy Carr, the British comedian whosparked outrage earlier this year for a routine about the Holocaustin his own Netflix stand-up special, also performed at the streaming giant's event on Tuesday. Carr tweeted afterwards,externalto say the show was ""crazy"" and he was ""just happy everyone's OK"". A spokeswoman for the Hollywood Bowl said an investigation has been launched, telling PA: ""The incident that occurred at the Hollywood Bowl on May 3 2022 is an active investigation and we are unable to comment further at this time."" Dave Chappelle alongside fellow comedian Jerry Seinfeld on Sunday, at a lunchtime event for the Netflix Is A Joke Festival In October, about100 people protested outside Netflix's headquartersover the airing of a comedy special by Chappelle, which they said was transphobic. They had objected to The Closer, in which he said ""gender is a fact"" and that LGBT people were ""too sensitive"". Chappelle later hit backat those who he said wanted to ""cancel"" him. ""To the transgender community, I am more than willing to give you an audience,"" he said. ""But you will not summon me. I am not bending to anybody's demands."" The likes of Seth Rogen, Snoop Dogg, Bill Burr and Pete Davidson are also starring at Netflix's inaugural comedy festival, as well as Jerry Seinfeld and recent Oscars co-host Wanda Sykes.

"UK MPs have invited Elon Musk to parliament so they can quiz him about his planned purchase of Twitter. The Commons Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee said it wanted to hear more about the billionaire's plans to balance ""free speech"" with ""obligations to protect Twitter's users"". There are concerns Mr Musk has plans to relax content rules, which critics say could increase hate speech on the site. But others have welcomed his commitment to protect freedom of expression. In a letter to the Tesla boss, committee chair Julian Knight said the MPs supported Mr Musk's commitments to remove all spam accounts and automated bots from Twitter. ""In particular, your intention to roll out verification for all users echoes our calls on the UK government as part of proposed legislation, which we hope will restore the UK public's trust in digital platforms,"" the Conservative MP wrote. ""I therefore wish to take this opportunity to invite you to speak before our committee and discuss your proposals in more depth,"" he added. ""I know you have expressed your wish that critics remain on Twitter and this may present an opportunity to address any critiques in public."" Allow Twitter content?

In a further statement, Mr Knight said the committee was keen ""learn more about how Mr Musk will balance his clear commitment to free speech with new obligations to protect Twitter's users from online harms"". ""Appearing before the committee will give Mr Musk an ideal opportunity to set out his proposals for Twitter in more depth and we would look forward to welcoming him,"" he said. Mr Musk agreed a $44bn (Â£34.5bn) takeover deal with the Twitter board last month, and said at the time that as well as improving the free speech principles of the site, he was looking forward to ""enhancing the product with new features"". As well as improving verification, the SpaceX boss has suggested cutting the price of the Twitter Blue subscription service and wants to bring in a tool to edit already posted tweets. On Monday at the annual Met Gala in New York, he also said he would make Twitter transparent about how tweets are promoted or demoted and wanted its software to be available for public scrutiny. But critics, largely on the political left, have warned that the billionaire's support of absolute free speech could allow hate speech to flourish. They also fear that suspended accounts, such as that of former US President Donald Trump, could be reinstated. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Meanwhile, Mr Musk has reportedly told potential investors that he may return the social media firm to the stock market in just a few years. Mr Musk plans to sell Twitter shares again as little as three years after buying it, according to the Wall Street Journal, which cited people familiar with the matter. His takeover of the company is expected to be completed later this year, subject to conditions including the approval of Twitter's shareholders and regulators. Under the deal he will buy all the shares in the company that are currently available on the stock market, taking it from being a publicly-owned company to a private one.

"Destiny makes crafts to sell while she is homeschooled by her mum Elina Starting school around lunchtime, learning geography and sometimes doing crafts all day make Destiny's day different to most. The 14-year-old is one of an estimated 90,000 UK children being home educated and she said it makes her ""feel free"". Destiny, who is autistic, makes and sells toys for cats for her online Etsy shop while studying for her GCSEs. It comes as data suggests the number of children being homeschooled in Wales has almost trebled in five years. Campaigners said Covid lockdowns have been an inspiration for some parents to home educate their children. I should be home-schooled, but I spent 10 months on Xbox Rogue heads 'talk parents into homeschooling' Why I home-educate my daughter Now the Welsh government plans to ""strengthen"" guidance to ensure learners children get a ""suitable education"" while ""wellbeing needs are met"". Destiny has been making toys for cats to sell online in classes with her mum For skateboarding YouTuber Destiny, being taught at home has made a ""massive difference"" to her confidence and mental health. ""I do different subjects and sometimes I can pick my own subject,"" said Destiny, who has been educated by mum Elina at their Carmarthenshire home since she was seven. Destiny enjoys geography lessons as well as learning creative skills ""Say for that day I just want to learn about geography, I do that. ""I tend to try and start at around 10am, or lunchtime, because it gives me time to wake up and to do my morning routine and do a journal. ""Every day is completely different. Even if I don't want to sit down and write up something, mum would give me options to either go outside and look at the birds or look up something and watch a documentary. ""I can play some relaxing music. I can fidget. I can bring teddies to school if I want to,"" Destiny, from Llanelli, told theBBC's Wales Live programme. While education is compulsory across the UK, going to school is not. While you do not have to follow the national curriculum, it is a parent's responsibility to ensure what is taught is helping a child to learn. The Education Act 1996 states a child must get an efficient and suitable full-time education for their age, ability and aptitude. Parents or carers who decide to educate their child at home may feel they are better able to meet their child's individual needs and learning style than a school - and guardians do not need to be a teacher or have any qualifications. People may be influenced by philosophical, spiritual or religious beliefs if they decide to home-school their children but will get no funding. Homeschooled children do not have to stick to a school-style timetable or follow school terms. Local education authorities will take action,externalif it appears parents are not providing a suitable education. There are no exact figures on how many UK children are home schooled full-time because there is no requirement for families to inform the local authority, unless the child is removed from school. BBC research last year found thenumber of UK children registering for home educationhad risen 75% and estimates show about 90,000 children are schooled at home. Parents and children can decide what different subjects are taught at home Latest figures show81,000 children are homeschooled in England,external,more than 5,000 in Scotland,external, about500 in Northern Ireland,externaland more than 3,500 in Wales. For context, there were fewer than 900 children identified as having their education at home a decade ago in Wales but now that number is now an estimated 3,540 - up from 3,273 the year before. Destiny lives in Carmarthenshire where the most homeschooled children in Wales live Carmarthenshire, where Destiny lives, has the highest numbers of home-educated pupils - 402, up from 284 two years earlier - while Ceredigion has the highest rate of homeschooled pupils at 32.1 per 1,000 children. Council figures obtained by Wales Live suggest the number of children recorded as home educated has almost trebled in the past five years. Although, figures may be inflated due to greater attempts from councils to find and record families who have opted against school. Destiny has been taught at home since leaving school aged seven where she became ""overwhelmed"". ""I did learn quite a lot of stuff, but it was very hard because when I got home I would always have a meltdown and cry,"" she said. Destiny says she has fewer friends than the people she knows who go to school, but she does not necessarily see that as a bad thing.

Destiny concentrates on lessons that inspire her during homeschool lessons "" A lot of people get bullied now and it gets worse, especially with social media. There's always a competition.

Mum Elina has been homeschooling daughter Destiny since she was seven ""My work life completely changed, because I was a single mum, I had to become self-employed and stop the job I was doing,"" the 40-year-old said. ""It's been like a rollercoaster - we've had really good periods and really difficult periods. ""Financially it can be very stressful because I had to pay for everything to do with her education."" Some home educators said their community had seen a ""big influx"" since the pandemic. ""I think that Covid particularly has given people a taster, they've dipped their toe in the water and found their child thrived,"" said Wendy Charles-Warner, chair of home education group, Education Otherwise. ""We have now lost the children from home education who perhaps should never have been home educated, the ones whose parents came to it through fear, through wanting to withhold their child from school until they felt it was safe."" The Welsh government said numbers of homeschooled children had increased during the pandemic, but it hoped learners could return to school if it was in their best interest. Welsh government is spending Â£1.7 million this year for home educated learners ""We are developing proposals that will strengthen the existing guidance on elective home education, to help ensure home educated children receive a suitable education and their wellbeing needs are met,"" said a spokesperson. The Welsh government said it will spend Â£1.7m on education resources and activities for home educated learners. ""The pandemic has highlighted the importance of ensuring that the support system for all children and young people, including those being home educated, is as effective as possible,"" the spokesperson added. Plaid Cymru said new laws were needed to protect home educated children, while the Welsh Conservatives better support was needed to ensure those learning from home received a ""top quality education"".

"This video can not be played Watch: EU ban on Russian oil will not be easy, says von der Leyen The EU has proposed some of its toughest measures yet against Russia, including a total ban on oil imports and sanctions on war crimes suspects. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the package was aimed at maximising pressure on Russia while minimising damage to Europe. Russian crude oil would be phased out within six months, she said. Hungary has rejected the proposal as unacceptable and the Czech and Slovak governments want a transition period. The EU has been focusing for weeks on how to wean itself off Russian oil and gas. It has already pledged to reduce gas imports by two-thirds by the end of 2022 and now plans to phase out crude oil over six months and refined products by the end of 2022. ""We will make sure that we phase out Russian oil in an orderly fashion,"" the Commission president said. The package first has to be approved by EU ambassadors and is set to be signed off in the next few days. But Hungarian government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs said his country would veto it in its current form: ""They exactly know that what they are proposing is against Hungarian interests... and if we do that we are completely going to ruin the Hungarian economy."" Slovakia as well as Hungary currently relies on Russian oil and under the initial proposal would be given until the end of 2023 to find alternative suppliers. Slovakia's economy minister said his country wanted a three-year transition period, while Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala said he would also seek a two-to-three year exemption to tackle problems with pipeline capacity. Last year, Russia supplied the EU with a quarter of its oil imports, and the Netherlands and Germany were the biggest buyers. The Dutch government has said it wants to halt all Russian fossil fuel imports by the end of this year and Germany has drastically reduced its reliance on Russian oil imports, down from 35% to 12%. The UK, which is no longer in the EU, is already phasing out Russian oil, which accounts for 8% of its imports. German Economics Minister Robert Habeck has said the six-month transition period gives Berlin long enough to make the change. The problem for Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic is that they are all landlocked and rely on their neighbours for fuel supplies. Czech special envoy for energy security Vaclav Bartuska told the BBC that Europe was currently trying to redraw the map of energy supplies as fast as it could: ""We want to get rid of Russian crude once and for all and we want to be absolutely sure there'll be no need to go back and ask Russia again."" How Germany is getting rid of Russian oil Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Moscow was working on various options in response to the planned embargo. Sanctions were a double-edged sword for the Europeans and others, he said, as the cost for European citizens would increase every day. Oil prices rose by 5% on news of the EU plan to $110 a barrel of Brent Crude. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said in a video briefing on social media thatthe gradual EU ban on oil was ""better than nothing"",external. Any country that opposed the oil embargo was complicit in Russia's crimes in Ukraine, he said, whatever their arguments. As well as seeking a ban on Russian oil, the EU Commission president announced that sanctions would be imposed on military officers involved in suspected war crimes in Bucha and Mariupol. ""This sends another important signal to all perpetrators of the Kremlin's war: We know who you are, and you will be held accountable,"" Ms von der Leyen told the European Parliament on Wednesday. There are plans for a broad ban on three of the biggest Russian state-run broadcasters. ""We have identified these TV channels as mouthpieces that amplify Putin's lies and propaganda aggressively,"" Ms von der Leyen said. Although the three networks were not named, they are thought to include the widely watched Russian-language Rossiya and RTR Planeta channels of state-owned operator VGTRK. The EU has already suspended two networks, RT and Sputnik, that broadcast in English, German and Spanish. A ban would also be imposed on providing European services to Russian companies through accountants, lawyers and spin-doctors, she said. Earlier sanctions have already hit Russian banks but the biggest bank of all, Sberbank, has been left off the list because it was considered necessary for paying for Russian gas. Sberbank makes up over a third of Russia's banking sector and is now set to be removed from the SWIFT global financial messaging system. Two other Russian banks are included in the proposals. Previous sanctions packages have also targeted a number of individuals linked to the Kremlin and the invasion, and the head of the Russian Orthodox Church, Patriarch Kirill, is said to be on the latest list. He has given his full support to the war, prompting Pope Francis to warn him not to become ""Putin's altar boy"". KYIV:Ukrainian villages haunted by the vanished ENERGY:EU divided over how to step away from Russian energy WATCH:The southern villages holding back the Russians READ MORE:Full coverage of the crisis,external The Commission president also gave details of plans to help Ukraine tackle the vast costs of the war and the impact on its economy. Explaining Europe's ""very special responsibility towards Ukraine"", she said Ukraine needed to fund the dramatic fall in its economic output and wider reconstruction. A recovery package would be drawn up that could tackle weaknesses in the Ukrainian economy and help fight corruption, she said. ""We want Ukraine to win this war, but we also want to set the conditions for Ukraine's success in the aftermath of the war."" In a separate move, the EU also promised to increase military aid to neighbouring Moldova, which is under threat from Russian soldiers based in the breakaway Moldova region of Transnistria.  ""We will continue to deepen our partnership with you to bring your country closer to the EU,"" European Council President Charles Michel told Moldova's pro-EU president, Maia Sandu, in Chisinau.

"Mr Vance campaigned with his own spin on the former president's populist rhetoric A candidate endorsed by Donald Trump has won the Republican Senate nomination for Ohio, in a sign of the former US president's continued influence on his party. Author and venture capitalist JD Vance beat six other candidates in a race that set a record for the most money, $66m (Â£52m), ever spent on an Ohio election. He trailed his more established political opponents for much of the primary campaign but saw a late surge following Mr Trump's endorsement. Mr Vance is best known for authoring the 2016 book Hillbilly Elegy, which was later made into a feature film. The book was about his upbringing in a small Kentucky town and the plight of poor rural white Americans. It was heralded as a clear-eyed look at the political and cultural environment that helped explain Mr Trump's appeal in rural and struggling industrial states. Mr Vance also benefitted from more than $10m in campaign support from billionaire technology entrepreneur Peter Thiel, one of Mr Trump's deep-pocketed allies. JD Vance: Can Trump's 'hillbilly' win the Senate? Mr Vance will now face Democratic Congressman Tim Ryan, who represents a former factory-dependent district in eastern Ohio, in the mid-term elections in November. It sets up a high-profile battle for the allegiance of blue-collar voters in this Midwestern state. In his victory speech before a small but festive Cincinnati crowd - some adorned in Mr Trump's red ""Make American Great Again"" hats - Mr Vance thanked the former president for his endorsement and underlined the importance of his victory for Mr Trump's agenda. ""They wanted to write the story that this campaign would be the death of Donald Trump's America-first agenda,"" he said. ""It ain't."" Mr Vance campaigned with his own spin on the former president's populist rhetoric, repeatedly criticising what he viewed as unfair trade competition from China and the threat undocumented migration posed to the safety and economic livelihood of Americans. Of the five top candidates, four fashioned themselves as disciples of the Trump political legacy. Runner-up Josh Mandel, a former Ohio state treasurer in his second bid for one of the state's Senate seats, made challenging the 2020 election results - an unrelenting obsession of the former president's - one of his top talking points. Mr Mandel received endorsements from many Republican leaders and groups, including Texas Senator Ted Cruz and the influential conservative group Club for Growth. Some of his supporters furiously lobbied the former president not to endorse Mr Vance, who was viewed as an outsider in Ohio politics. That outsider status, however, may have helped secure the candidate's victory. ""People who are caught between the corrupt political class of the left and the right, they need a voice,"" Mr Vance said on Tuesday night. ""And we're going to give it to them."" Nicholas Contras, a retired lawyer from Cincinnati who attended Mr Vance's celebration, said it was the candidate's anti-establishment status that won him over. The author, he said, could ""stand up to the Washington swamp"" - echoing the kind of rhetoric and sentiment that powered Mr Trump to victory in mid-western states like Ohio in 2016. This race was the first test in a month that will go a long way toward demonstrating the power Donald Trump's endorsement has in Republican politics. In two weeks, another Trump-endorsed celebrity candidate, television doctor Mehmet Oz, will stand before voters in a tight field for the Republican Senate primary in Pennsylvania. The following week in Georgia, a Trump Senate pick, former football star Herschel Walker, appears headed for victory, while his choice for governor, David Perdue, trails incumbent Republican Governor Brian Kemp by a sizable margin. At the moment, Republicans across the US continue to demonstrate respect for, or fear of, Mr Trump's political influence more than a year after he left the White House under a cloud of controversy. Over the four years of his presidency, he filled out much of the Republican establishment with loyalists and ideological acolytes. If he can continue to do so through these upcoming mid-term elections, it will be a strong sign that his grip on party power is enduring.

"""Living the dream!"" says a senior political figure with a smile, as the high-minded pursuit of democracy collides with the inevitability of yet another motorway service station. Politicians have been on the road for some weeks now, pounding pavements and knocking on doors as they try to convince voters that they are the ones to vote for. It is a political party's job to obsess about its popularity, or the lack of it. And along comes the real thing in this week's elections: real votes in real ballot boxes electing real politicians. England's local elections this week will decide who runs the local services millions of us rely on every day and how millions of pounds of our money, paid in taxes, is spent. And they matter for a bigger picture reason too. Is there an election in my area? How do I vote in the UK's elections? Cost of living dominates in key election battleground They are the weather makers of the political mood at Westminster and inside our political parties. Will the Conservatives get a kicking over the row about lockdown parties? Governments tend to take a bit of a bashing, sometimes a lot of a bashing, at local elections and the Tories have been in government for 12 years. So what are the political parties saying privately and what should we look out for as the results come in? Very broadly speaking, the local elections happening in England this year are in spots that tilt disproportionately towards Labour, compared with the nation as a whole. Nearly half are being contested in London, and while Labour's had a rough time in plenty of places, in London, it's done well. The last time most of the seats up for grabs held contests was in 2018, when Labour had its best night in local elections since 2012, and Labour and the Conservatives were pretty much level pegging in terms of national popularity (though it was 18 months-ish after that, that Labour were crushed in the 2019 general election). So while general expectation would probably be that Labour should be on course for modest gains in terms of seats, the picture is rather more complicated than that. Senior figures in the party don't expect a dramatic increase in the number of councils they are in charge of, but instead are focused on their projected national share of the vote. Will it indicate, come the weekend, that Labour is doing enough to win the next general election? It's a steep challenge. ""We've been climbing out of a grave,"" is how one Labour figure describes Sir Keir Starmer's team's progress in this campaign. The graphic imagery is striking - the sense that being alive again is an achievement - although critics say Sir Keir's not done enough to set out exactly who he is and what matters to him. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer trying to win votes in Worthing In the days before any election, parties can rarely resist a spot of expectation management, talking down any potential for success, or catastophising about expected doom, so even a thrashing can be presented as a plucky triumph against impossible odds. Senior Conservatives are privately bandying around all sorts of big numbers about the seats they expect to lose and fret particularly about relatively well-off people who didn't like Brexit, have never much liked Boris Johnson and hate all the stuff about parties in lockdown. They fear this will tempt these traditional Conservative voters to head to the Liberal Democrats or not bother voting at all. POSTCODE SEARCH:Is there an election in my area?

Supporters of the prime minister are already preparing to do what they can to reassure those Conservatives who might go all jittery and wobbly after Thursday's results. Later on this month, they are getting ready to talk up what they call their ""80-20 strategy"" for the next general election - their project for holding on to the 80 most marginal parliamentary seats, and the 20 they might hope to gain. And Boris Johnson's allies sigh with relief that there is ""no prince over the water"" as it was put to me: no main rival to the PM, as the Chancellor Rishi Sunak's difficult recent weeks are greeted with a smile. Ed Davey helping pick up litter in the West Midlands What about the Liberal Democrats? One party source describes these local elections as ""not a snapshot, more like looking through a letterbox,"" given, as Lord Hayward says, big chunks of potentially electorally fertile, traditionally Tory territory isn't there to be harvested this time. They have their eyes on gains in Sunderland and potentially winning in Hull, against Labour and, elsewhere, luring some of the aforementioned gravel drive crunchers in possession of a polling card. Lib Dems fret that 2018 was a ""peak stop Brexit moment"" - a big draw for them at the time - and politics is very different now. On the other hand, Westminster by-election wins in Chesham and Amersham in Buckinghamshire and also in North Shropshire means, they hope, there is a ""believability"" again about the idea of the party being able to win. The extra media attention the party gets during election campaigns often helps them too. When party leader Sir Ed Davey gets invited onto Loose Women on ITV as he did the other day, you can hazard a guess an election is imminent. The Green Party launched their campaign in south London And a quick word about the Green Party. As I wrotethis time last yearthey have been steadily building in recent years, albeit from a small base. Breaking through to have any presence on a local authority really matters to them, because - as with the Liberal Democrats on a bigger scale - they can then prove that winning is possible. In London, keep an eye on Hackney and Newham. They hope to become a significant presence in Peterborough, Sheffield and Hastings among others. Before I go, there's one other thing to remember: turnout. To state the flipping obvious, elections are popularity contests involving those who can be bothered to vote. And plenty can't in local elections. Turnout is almost always low. The parties who are successful at getting more of their loyal supporters out to back them could well be those with the biggest smiles come the weekend.

"Elections have taken place across the UK on 5 May. Voters in England, Wales, and Scotland were picking who should run services that affect everyday life in their local area. People in Northern Ireland were choosing its government. The results are likely to reflect how people feel about Boris Johnson, the ""partygate"" scandal, how Covid has been handled and the rising cost of living.

Local councils are responsible for everything from bins, bus routes and potholes, to providing mental health services, deciding planning applications and managing schemes to tackle climate change. In England, more than 4,000 councillors in 146 councils are up for election in major cities including Leeds, Manchester, Birmingham and all 32 London boroughs. South Yorkshire was voting for a regional mayor and 1,000 parish councils were electing about 10,000 councillors. Because of the huge number of seats being contested across England - some of them for the first time since 2018 - the results are likely to paint the clearest picture of the national mood. Read more about the English elections Cost of living likely to dominate England elections The election for Northern Ireland's government is largely a contest between the parties in two blocs - unionists, who favour remaining part of the United Kingdom, and nationalists, who favour a united Ireland. Since 2003, the Democratic Unionist Party has been the largest party in the national assembly, followed by nationalists Sinn FÃ©in. The two parties, along with other unionist and nationalist parties, and an increasingly popular third bloc of non-aligned parties, have governed under a mandatory power-sharing agreement that ended decades of fighting. Recent polls suggest Sinn FÃ©in could take the lead for the first time. If Sinn FÃ©in becomes the largest party, the DUP has not said whether it would agree to share power. That means it's possible that even after the election, the Assembly could remain without a devolved government for at least six months. Read more about the Northern Ireland election NI election 2022: Compare party policies How does Northern Ireland's power-sharing government work? All seats in 22 local councils are being contested across Wales, where people can vote from the age of 16. The political make-up has been mixed since the last election in 2017 and the majority of councils are currently run by coalitions - an agreement between at least two parties to share power. Eyes will be on whether Labour can maintain its hold over Cardiff and the cities along the M4 corridor, and how the Conservatives perform in the north-east of the country, where they made gains last time. Read more about the Welsh elections There was voting in all 32 local authorities. The last election in 2017 saw the Conservatives make big gains from Labour, however they failed to gain overall control and most councils have been run by coalitions ever since. The largest cities - Glasgow and Edinburgh - are always ones to watch, but this year's results are also likely to reflect how Scots feel more generally about such issues as recent council tax changes and post-pandemic recovery.

"Inmate Casey White (L) and corrections officer Vicky White An escaped inmate and a guard suspected of helping him had a ""special relationship"", say investigators. The announcement from the Alabama sheriff's office said the discovery was confirmed by fellow inmates of missing prisoner Casey White, a murder suspect. A manhunt is under way for the 38-year-old escapee and corrections officer Vicky White, 56 (no relation). The pair vanished as she was transporting him to a bogus mental evaluation. Police have not revealed whether the relationship was romantic. Friday - the day the pair went missing - was supposed to be her final day at work. She had recently sold her home and told colleagues she planned to spend more time at the beach. This video can not be played WATCH: CCTV footage of guard and inmate escaping Police now believe Ms White helped orchestrate the escape after breaking jail protocol to escort Casey White alone. ""Investigators received information from inmates at the Lauderdale County Detention Center over the weekend that there was a special relationship between Director White and inmate Casey White,"" Sheriff Rick Singleton said in a statement on Tuesday. ""That relationship has now been confirmed through our investigation by independent sources and means."" On Tuesday, the US Marshals Service said the two were last seen on Friday driving a copper-coloured Ford Edge with an Alabama registration plate. The same bulletin gave two aliases for Ms White - April Davis and Renee Marie Maxwell. Authorities say Casey White should be considered ""armed and extremely dangerous"". Officials say they may now have access to an AR-15 rifle and a shotgun. On Monday, Sheriff Singleton described the 6ft 9in Casey White as ""extremely dangerous"" and advised law enforcement not to ""take any chances"" with him. ""He has nothing to lose,"" he said. He added that Ms White is thought to be using cash, and has switched off her mobile phone. The US Secret Service is helping to track her financial records, he said. ""I would have trusted Vicky with my life. I really mean it,"" Lauderdale County District Attorney Chris Connolly told reporters. ""If we needed something from the jail, she was our go-to person, solid employee. That's why it's so shocking."" The Marshals Service called Ms White a ""wanted fugitive"". Casey White was charged in September 2020 with murder over the stabbing of 58-year-old Connie Ridgeway. He was already serving 75 years for a series of violent crimes in 2015, including burglary, vehicle theft and a police chase. He allegedly confessed to the murder, but later pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity, and was awaiting trial at the Lauderdale County Jail when he disappeared, authorities added. He faces execution if convicted. Meanwhile, a woman who White tried to kill during a burglary said she is ""freaking out"" after discovering he is on the loose. The unnamed womantold local ABC affiliate WAAY 31,externalthat she and her family are in hiding, fearful that White will track them down. She also said she has a message for Ms White:Â ""If she is still alive, get the hell out. Run. Run as far as you can, and turn yourself in, and contact somebody. ""Like, do the right thing before you lose your life or somebody else does.""

"""Living the dream!"" says a senior political figure with a smile, as the high-minded pursuit of democracy collides with the inevitability of yet another motorway service station. Politicians have been on the road for some weeks now, pounding pavements and knocking on doors as they try to convince voters that they are the ones to vote for. It is a political party's job to obsess about its popularity, or the lack of it. And along comes the real thing in this week's elections: real votes in real ballot boxes electing real politicians. England's local elections this week will decide who runs the local services millions of us rely on every day and how millions of pounds of our money, paid in taxes, is spent. And they matter for a bigger picture reason too. Is there an election in my area? How do I vote in the UK's elections? Cost of living dominates in key election battleground They are the weather makers of the political mood at Westminster and inside our political parties. Will the Conservatives get a kicking over the row about lockdown parties? Governments tend to take a bit of a bashing, sometimes a lot of a bashing, at local elections and the Tories have been in government for 12 years. So what are the political parties saying privately and what should we look out for as the results come in? Very broadly speaking, the local elections happening in England this year are in spots that tilt disproportionately towards Labour, compared with the nation as a whole. Nearly half are being contested in London, and while Labour's had a rough time in plenty of places, in London, it's done well. The last time most of the seats up for grabs held contests was in 2018, when Labour had its best night in local elections since 2012, and Labour and the Conservatives were pretty much level pegging in terms of national popularity (though it was 18 months-ish after that, that Labour were crushed in the 2019 general election). So while general expectation would probably be that Labour should be on course for modest gains in terms of seats, the picture is rather more complicated than that. Senior figures in the party don't expect a dramatic increase in the number of councils they are in charge of, but instead are focused on their projected national share of the vote. Will it indicate, come the weekend, that Labour is doing enough to win the next general election? It's a steep challenge. ""We've been climbing out of a grave,"" is how one Labour figure describes Sir Keir Starmer's team's progress in this campaign. The graphic imagery is striking - the sense that being alive again is an achievement - although critics say Sir Keir's not done enough to set out exactly who he is and what matters to him. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer trying to win votes in Worthing In the days before any election, parties can rarely resist a spot of expectation management, talking down any potential for success, or catastophising about expected doom, so even a thrashing can be presented as a plucky triumph against impossible odds. Senior Conservatives are privately bandying around all sorts of big numbers about the seats they expect to lose and fret particularly about relatively well-off people who didn't like Brexit, have never much liked Boris Johnson and hate all the stuff about parties in lockdown. They fear this will tempt these traditional Conservative voters to head to the Liberal Democrats or not bother voting at all. POSTCODE SEARCH:Is there an election in my area? WHAT'S HAPPENING WHERE:Really simple guide ENGLAND:Simple guide GUIDE:How to vote in local elections NOTIFICATIONS:Sign up for Northern Ireland election alerts Lord Hayward, the Conservative peer and long time election watcher, talks of what he describes as a ""social divide"" between the ""Waitrose-shopping, Radio 4-listening, Remain-voting, gravel drive-owning"" voters in places such as the Home Counties, Trafford in Greater Manchester and Solihull in the West Midlands, many of whom are tiring of Boris Johnson - and more traditional, blue collar, industrial places where support for him appears to be holding up. The Tories are fortunate, Lord Hayward tells me, that there aren't elections this time in large parts of Kent, or Essex, Hampshire and Berkshire. Boris Johnson on a visit to Burnley College Sixth Form Centre Conservative figures take comfort from what they perceive to be a lack of enthusiasm for Sir Keir Starmer, but believe the Liberal Democrats have detoxified themselves since the years of coalition government when vast swathes of their supporters ran a mile. Supporters of the prime minister are already preparing to do what they can to reassure those Conservatives who might go all jittery and wobbly after Thursday's results. Later on this month, they are getting ready to talk up what they call their ""80-20 strategy"" for the next general election - their project for holding on to the 80 most marginal parliamentary seats, and the 20 they might hope to gain. And Boris Johnson's allies sigh with relief that there is ""no prince over the water"" as it was put to me: no main rival to the PM, as the Chancellor Rishi Sunak's difficult recent weeks are greeted with a smile.
