"Clarke is known for shows including Doctor Who, Bulletproof and Viewpoint Actor Noel Clarke has said he's ""deeply sorry"" for some of his actions and will seek professional help, but has again ""vehemently"" denied sexual misconduct. His statement comes after 20 women accused him of harassment and bullying. ITV and Sky have now dropped his shows. He said: ""I vehemently deny any sexual misconduct or criminal wrongdoing. ""Recent reports however have made it clear to me that some of my actions have affected people in ways I did not intend or realise."" He added: ""To those individuals, I am deeply sorry. I will be seeking professional help to educate myself and change for the better."" The statement follows ITV's decision not to broadcast the final episode of the police drama Viewpoint, in which he stars, on Friday. His Viewpoint co-stars Bronagh Waugh and Alexandra Roach tweeted their support to the women who made the allegations. Sky has also ""halted"" its work with Clarke, including on the fourth series of crime drama Bulletproof. ITV drops Noel Clarke thriller after allegations Bafta suspends Noel Clarke over harassment claims And he has been suspended by Bafta, almost three weeks after the British film and television academy gave him an award for his outstanding contribution. Clarke is known for playing Mickey Smith in Doctor Who from 2005-10, and for his film trilogy Kidulthood, Adulthood and Brotherhood. He is also a writer, director and producer. He played a surveillance detective in Viewpoint, which has been on ITV every evening this week. It was watched by 3.5 million people on Thursday. Clarke's police drama Viewpoint will no longer be screened on Friday night But on Friday, the broadcaster said it was ""no longer appropriate to broadcast the final episode"" as planned in light of the allegations. However, the finale will be available on streaming service ITV Hub from Friday night until Sunday ""for any viewers who wish to seek it out, and watch its conclusion"". Meanwhile, Clarke has starred in three series of Sky crime drama Bulletproof, which had a fourth series commissioned in January. The broadcaster said on Friday: ""Effective immediately, we have halted Noel Clarke's involvement in any future Sky productions."" Clarke won his first Bafta for Rising Star in 2009 Bafta has been criticised by some for honouring Clarke on 10 April. It had received reports of allegations against Clarke in the 12 days between announcing him as the award recipient and the ceremony itself. According to the Guardian,external, Bafta's chairman Krishnendu Majumdar said he had heard that as many as 12 women could be making allegations. In a letter to members in which it defended its response, Bafta said the emails it received ""were either anonymous or second or third-hand accounts via intermediaries"". ""No first-hand allegations were sent to us,"" it said. ""No names, times, dates, productions or other details were ever provided. ""Had the victims gone on record as they have with the Guardian, the award would have been suspended immediately. Noel Clarke's counsel received a legal notice to this effect. It was always very clear what our intentions would be."" Bafta added that it was ""an arts charity that is not in a position to properly investigate such matters"". The Charity Commission said Bafta had ""submitted a serious incident report"", which the regulator is now assessing. Paul Fleming, general secretary of arts union Equity, said it had been ""a difficult day for those who run the industry"". ""It's a phenomenally embarrassing and traumatic 24 hours if you're a gatekeeper and in charge of what goes on in our members' workplace,"" he told BBC Radio 4's PM Programme. ""It really does take something to be here, [the] best part of four years on from #MeToo and still be asking these questions. ""And for big bosses, big producers to have not put in place the polices practises and cultures in workplaces that allow these things to be considered credibleâ¦ ""This is a really, really damning indictment of how intimidating some workplaces and some producers are for our members to raise concerns.""

"This video can not be played Survivors have told of hearing people scream underneath them Families in Israel have begun burying their loved ones after at least 45 people died in a crush at a crowded Jewish festival overnight. Some 150 people were also injured at the Lag B'Omer festival, near Mount Meron, when people became trapped in an overcrowded passageway. Funerals were allowed to take place for victims who were positively identified. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu promised that an inquiry would ensure such a tragedy did not happen again. Visiting the scene, he said it was one of the worst peacetime disasters the country had known. One survivor who gave his name as David told Ynet news it had felt like a human wave had broken: ""Our bodies were swept along by themselves. People were thrown up in the air - others were crushed on the ground."" Medics struggled to reach the injured in the ensuing chaos. Witnesses: 'People were thrown up in the air' What is the Lag B'Omer festival? Those who died are believed to be predominantly men or boys from the ultra-Orthodox community as the crush at the largely gender-segregated event apparently happened in one of the men's sections. Mourners attended a funeral ceremony in Jerusalem Some victims are believed to be foreign nationals. Israeli airline El Al has offered to assist family members of victims living abroad who wish to attend their loved ones' funerals in Israel. Sunday has been declared a national day of mourning. Bodies of the dead were taken to the Greenberg Institute of Forensic Medicine in Tel Aviv, which had identified 32 before the process was halted for 24 hours on Friday evening for observance of the Sabbath. One of the first funerals to be reported was that of Rabbi Elazar Goldberg, who was in his late thirties. Mourners in Jerusalem prayed, some wept, as the body covered in a white sheet was moved into the back of a vehicle ahead of burial, Reuters news agency reports. Women comfort each other at a funeral in Bnei Brak A funeral took place at Segula cemetery in the town of Petah Tikva Two of the youngest victims were brothers Moshe Natan Englander, 14, and Yehoshua Englander, 9, from Jerusalem. At least two of the dead are US citizens from New York, Congressman Mondaire Jones confirmed in a tweet. Israeli President Reuven Rivlin lit 45 candles on Friday afternoon to commemorate the dead, the Jerusalem Post reports. ""This is the time to hug the families and to help them find their loved ones - to cry together,"" he said. ""This is a hard and painful day. This tragedy is heartbreaking."" The site includes several large gathering grounds with open-air stands and stages, connected by a network of paths. It was along one of those paths where witnesses said the crush of people began at around 01:00 local time (22:00 GMT Thursday). Some witnesses said the incident had begun when police closed the passageway, said to be 3m (10ft) wide. Police sources told Haaretz newspaper some people had slipped on steps, causing dozens more to fall over. This was not officially confirmed. An injured man lying on a hospital bed said a line of people in the front of the surging crowd had simply collapsed. Benjamin Netanyahu visited the scene in Mount Meron. He called the deaths a ""heavy disaster"" ""A pyramid of one on top of another was formed,"" the unnamed man was quoted as saying by Reuters news agency. ""People were piling up one on top of the other. I was in the second row. The people in the first row - I saw people die in front of my eyes."" Dov Maisel, director of operations for volunteer-based emergency services organisation United Hatzalah, told the BBC he had never witnessed such a scene in his 30-year career. ""It felt like a surreal scene where we had over 20 people undergoing CPR by our teams, with limited ability to evacuate from the scene, simply because the place was too overwhelmed with people,"" he said. Witnesses say a police barricade prevented people from leaving the crowded area. The festival was taking place near the tomb of the 2nd Century sage Rabbi Shimon Bar Yochai Israel's state watchdog, the State Comptroller's office, issued warnings in 2008 and 2011 of the risk of a disaster. Special danger was posed by access roads and paths which ""are narrow and not appropriate to accommodate the hundreds of thousands of people who visit the site"", the office wasquoted as saying by the New York Times,external. What was different this year was that bonfire areas were partitioned off as a Covid-19 precaution and this may have created unexpected choke-points for foot traffic, Reuters reports, quoting Israeli media. Thousands of police officers closed down the event after the crush before helping evacuate attendees. Investigators will look into whether there was any police misconduct, the justice ministry said. Mr Netanyahu promised a ""serious"" investigation that ""would ensure this kind of disaster never happens again"". Some witnesses said people fell down a narrow staircase before the crush Regional police chief Shimon Lavi told reporters at the scene he took upon himself ""the overall responsibility, for good and for bad"" and was ""ready for every inspection"". He later told AFP news agency his officers had done all they could on a ""tragic night"". Other police officials told local media people had slipped in the walkway and the crush had been ""out of their control"". An unnamed police source told Haaretz the incident could not have been prevented,externaland the police were not to blame. US President Joe Biden called Prime Minister Netanyahu to offer his condolences. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said his thoughts were with ""the Israeli people and those who have lost loved ones in this tragedy"" and German Chancellor Angela and offered her ""heartfelt sympathies"". UK sends messages of grief and support At the disaster site, men come in their dozens. Some pray. Others stand in groups, exchange short words and point to where tragedy unfolded. I walk down the ramp from the top of the slope where the crowd swelled. It is made of metal, with no steps, and eyewitness say it was wet and slippery. Then the narrow passageway turns hard to the right and there are steep steps. One man points down them. ""The police, they put barriers there!"" he says, anger rising in his voice. People say they could not get out as the crowd at the top, unaware, carried on coming. Jewish pilgrims travel here in their hundreds of thousands for blessings at the shrine of a rabbi from antiquity. Instead, this year they met panic and a deadly crush. And now this holy site witnesses an unplanned, mass evacuation. The festival was cancelled, and people are being bused out in their tens of thousands.

"Engineers are working around the clock to clear the giant fatberg, Severn Trent said A giant fatberg thought to weigh about 300 tonnes is clogging a sewer in Birmingham. The mass of oil, grease and ""unflushable"" items such as nappies and wet wipes is blocking the system in Hodge Hill. Severn Trent said the fatberg was likely to be one of the biggest blockages it had dealt with. The firm said it is estimated to be 1m (3ft) high and 1,000m (1,094yds) long and could take until June to clear. ""It is a massive project and it is not resolved yet,"" operations manager Scott Burgin said. ""This giant mass is the result of everyone occasionally washing and flushing the wrong things down the drains and not realising the impact that it is having."" Severn Trent is using a pump to remove sewage Severn Trent has brought in pumping and piping equipment in to tackle the fatberg Severn Trent said it was alerted to the fatberg by sewer sensors and engineers were working around the clock to tackle it. The mass is thought to weigh the equivalent of 250 family cars. Severn Trent workers have dug into the ground to access the sewer pipe which is 8m deep (26ft) and are using pumps to remove the sewage and clean the sewer. In the last year, the firm said it has been called to thousands of blockages across the West Midlands with three-quarters caused by people ""misusing the sewer system"".

"Joe Rogan, Spotify's most popular podcast host, often sparks controversy Hugely popular US podcast host Joe Rogan has backpedalled on his comments that young, healthy people could forgo the coronavirus vaccine. ""I'm not an anti-vax person,"" Rogan said. ""I believe they're safe and encourage many people to take them."" But Rogan did not walk back his suggestion that the young and healthy do not ""need"" vaccines, which drew backlash from White House officials. Experts say everyone over 16 should get vaccinated to stop the virus' spread. The Joe Rogan Experience was Spotify's most popular podcast in 2020, though the streaming giant did not share the number of times his episodes were downloaded. Rogan has more than seven million followers on Twitter and 12.5 million followers on Instagram. His podcast was acquired by Spotify last year for more than $100m (Â£77m). Asked about Rogan's comments, top US infectious disease expert Dr Anthony Fauci repeated guidance from experts that unvaccinated, asymptomatic people can still transmit Covid-19. ""Even if you don't have any symptoms, you're propagating the outbreak,"" Dr Fauci said. Spotify and Joe Rogan under fire for Alex Jones Why Joe Rogan's exclusive Spotify deal matters One Covid vaccine dose halves transmission - study Rogan made the comments during a 23 April episode of his podcast, which was first reported by Media Matters this week. In that episode, Rogan told listeners that he would not suggest the vaccine to a healthy 21-year-old. ""If you're a healthy person, and you're exercising all the time, and you're young, and you're eating well...like, I don't think you need to worry about this."" Responding to the criticism on his podcast on Thursday, Rogan said the argument that young people need the vaccine ""for other people"" made sense. ""But that's a different argument,"" he added. And Rogan stressed that he should not be a source of scientific advice. ""I'm not a doctor,"" he said. ""I'm not a respected source of information, even for me."" The TV host-turned media mogul regularly courts controversy for his blunt and sometimes inflammatory style on air. He has been accused of making sexist, racist and transphobic comments in his podcast. Rogan has denied these accusations and said his comments were taken out of context. Joe Rogan is a huge draw for Spotify - so much so, in fact, that his show was mentioned in Spotify's quarterly earnings call. Joe Rogan's podcast had ""performed above expectations,"" the company said. Spotify wants to be the place you go to for podcasts and The Joe Rogan Experience is a major plank in that strategy. You might come for Joe Rogan, but stay to listen to other podcasts.  Spotify says it's seen a ""strong increase"" in the number of people listening to podcasts since the pandemic hit. However wrapping yourself around a controversial figure like Rogan has its dangers - and this saga illustrates that risk. Rogan said when he signed the deal with Spotify that he would have editorial control. Spotify have publicly backed the podcaster. But of course Spotify does have the power to pull the podcast. As ever Big Tech says it's is trying to balance two things: risk to the public v freedom of speech. However there's always a third factor. Money. When the face of your podcast offering says something that US politicians, the White House and medical experts deride as dangerous - that doesn't look good for Spotify's brand. For now, it looks like Spotify is willing to back the podcaster, and Rogan will hope his retraction will draw a line under the matter. Rogan is not the only US public figure to be accused of anti-vaccine remarks. Current US Vice-President Kamala Harris said during the election campaign last year that she would not trust any vaccine approved by the Trump administration. Then-US Vice-President Mike Pence accused her of ""playing politics with people's lives"". US Vice-President Kamala Harris was last year accused of anti-vaccine comments Two coronavirus shots - by Pfizer and Moderna - were subsequently granted authorisation under Mr Trump. Ms Harris received the Moderna jab after the election and said then it was safe. Last year, both Rogan and Spotify faced criticism over the appearance of conspiracy theorist Alex Jones on his show. The streaming giant has so far stood by its star host, touting Rogan's podcast in its first quarter earnings report this week. Spotify did not immediately return a BBC request for comment. ""We have 8 million creators, and hundreds of millions of pieces of content,"" Spotify CEO Daniel Ek told Bloomberg News. ""We have a content policy and we do remove pieces that violate it."" US and global health authorities have found Covid-19 vaccines to be safe and effective in preventing infection and safety checks continue throughout the world. Experts have warned that misinformation has been fuelling vaccine hesitancy. In the US, nearly 100 million people have been fully vaccinated. This week, President Joe Biden urged all Americans to get their jab, calling it a ""patriotic duty"". Covid vaccines: How fast is worldwide progress?

"Rudi Batten was sentenced to six years in prison after entering guilty pleas A man who raided a McDonald's brandishing a fake gun and demanding nuggets has been jailed, after fleeing with a McMuffin and cash from the till. Rudi Batten, 22, threatened staff at the Yate branch on 8 February demanding cash and chicken nuggets. He was told they were only serving breakfast so chose a double-sausage McMuffin. The night before, he raided the nearby Miss Millie's restaurant, taking Â£200 and fried chicken. He has been jailed for six years. Batten, of Station Road in Yate, pleaded guilty to two counts of robbery, two counts of having an imitation firearm with intent to commit an indictable offence and one count of possessing a knife or blade in a public place. Judge William Hart said staff had been ""clearly terrified"" On 8 February, he went to the McDonald's and took Â£50 in notes from a till before holding an imitation gun to the head of the manager and leading him to the safe. Sentencing at Bristol Crown Court, Judge William Hart said staff had been ""clearly terrified"". ""A chilling aspect of that robbery is the way the gun was held,"" he said ''It's the last thing people would expect in a quiet takeaway in that part of the country."" He also took a red tin containing Â£250 in notes, two float bags containing Â£100 each and a bag of coins Speaking for the defence, Emma Martin said Batten was ""utterly ashamed and embarrassed"" by the way he had behaved. ""The lack of sophistication, the lack of any disguise are indicative of the desperation with which these offences were committed,"" she said. ""He had got himself involved in drink and drugs and with that comes the problem of paying for it."" Judge Hart also ordered the forfeiture and destruction of the imitation firearm, plus the forfeiture of the stolen money.

"Fishing crews have been ""disastrously let down"" by the government's failure to reach a deal with Norway, UK Fisheries chief executive has said. UK fleets will not have access to Norway's sub-Arctic seas, following the breakdown of UK-Norway negotiations. One trawler, which catches 10% of fish sold in chip shops, will be tied up for a year following the collapse in talks. The government said it had offered a ""fair deal"" but the two sides were ""too far apart"" to agree a deal this year. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said fishing communities had been ""betrayed by the prime minister"". The UK's departure from the EU means it is no longer part of the European Common Fisheries Policy and instead negotiates with Norway directly over fishing catches. Who really owns UK fishing rights? What does the deal mean for fishing? A quick guide to what's in the Brexit deal The UK and Norway have a basic post-Brexit agreement on fishing, but annual negotiations are still needed to pin down detailed numbers. Those negotiations are meant to conclude by the beginning of each year, but the timing of the EU-UK trade deal in December 2020 had a knock-on effect that meant everything was delayed. The failure to reach a deal means Norwegian vessels will also lose access to UK waters in 2021. But one of the main species they catch is blue whiting, and a lot of that is caught in the first couple of months of the year which have already gone. UK vessels, on the other hand, fish throughout the year for cod. And as warmer sea temperatures push cod stocks further north, they cannot replace the cod they have been catching in Norwegian waters by fishing in UK waters instead. Many people in the fishing industry felt let down by the EU-UK trade deal, but that was about its future potential. ""This is actually a loss of real fishing opportunities,"" says Barrie Deas of the National Federation of Fishermen's Organisations, ""and in that sense we've gone backwards"". Big Scottish fishing firms will be able to catch more mackerel because of the absence of Norwegian vessels in UK waters, but most of the rest of the industry will be bitterly disappointed. The government will argue that it had to stick to its guns in a tough negotiation, and there was always likely to be some upheaval as a result of the UK exit from the Common Fisheries Policy. It changes the UK relationship with big fishing countries like Norway, as well as with the EU itself. Andrew Crook - president of the National Federation of Fish Friers - warned that it could increase the price of fish and chips. ""We rely on having some domestic catch to keep the market stable and any lack of competition is going to have an impact on prices,"" the fish and chip owner said. ""We are already seeing large increases on almost all of our supplies and we fear this will continue."" Speaking to BBC Radio 4, Jane Sandell chief executive of UK Fisheries, said the failure to reach an agreement would mean her firm having only 40% of the fishing opportunities of previous years. Her Hull-based company employs approximately 100 crew and Ms Sandell said the news would be ""absolutely devastating"" for those workers and their families. ""It means so much in this area to our history and our culture... we are in total shock, we never believed this would actually happen."" She said the lack of a deal would mean their Kirkella trawler - which catches around 10% of all the fish sold in the UK chip shops -  would be ""tied up"" for a year. This video can not be played Hull-based super-trawler Kirkella has an on-board fish factory and gym for the crew. She also criticised the government for failing ""to deliver on all of the deals we previously had through the EU with third countries"". ""So with the Faroes and Norway, the deals have failed and Greenland they didn't even bother starting,"" she told Today. The National Federation of Fishermen's Organisations said the failure to reach agreement would lead to more vessels trying ""to make a living in the constrained waters of the North Sea and West of Scotland"". John Dixon, 31, from Hull, is second mate onboard the Kirkella and spoke to BBC reporter Pritti Mistry. He says his ""heart dropped"" when he heard the news. ""We're waking up in the morning and we're literally panicking about when money is going to come in. ""The fishing community is so large here it's unbelievable and we're all struggling. ""I've been fishing since I was 17 - it's in my blood."" He says two generations of his family have been fishermen - his dad, his granddad and uncles. ""If it collapses here and now it's going to stop with me - my son's already told me he wants to go to sea. ""In all honesty it's disgusting - you feel betrayed."" Elspeth Macdonald, chief executive of the Scottish Fishermen's Federation, said opportunities in the coming year would be ""very constrained"" but added that they ""appreciate the efforts of negotiators who worked hard to try to secure a deal... during what is an extremely difficult year for the industry"". A spokesman for the environment department said: ""We have always been clear that we will only strike agreements if they are balanced and in the interests of the UK fishing industry. ""We put forward a fair offer on access to UK waters and the exchange of fishing quotas, but we have concluded that our positions remain too far apart to reach an agreement this year. ""We will continue to work with them [Norway] over the course of the year."" The National Federation of Fishermen's Organisations says the lack of a deal will have implications for UK chippies Labour leader Sir Keir said the prime minister had ""made big promises"" but had ""failed to deliver"". ""Whichever way people voted - leave or remain - they don't deserve this,"" he added.

"Rudi Batten was sentenced to six years in prison after entering guilty pleas A man who raided a McDonald's brandishing a fake gun and demanding nuggets has been jailed, after fleeing with a McMuffin and cash from the till. Rudi Batten, 22, threatened staff at the Yate branch on 8 February demanding cash and chicken nuggets. He was told they were only serving breakfast so chose a double-sausage McMuffin. The night before, he raided the nearby Miss Millie's restaurant, taking Â£200 and fried chicken. He has been jailed for six years. Batten, of Station Road in Yate, pleaded guilty to two counts of robbery, two counts of having an imitation firearm with intent to commit an indictable offence and one count of possessing a knife or blade in a public place. Judge William Hart said staff had been ""clearly terrified"" On 8 February, he went to the McDonald's and took Â£50 in notes from a till before holding an imitation gun to the head of the manager and leading him to the safe. Sentencing at Bristol Crown Court, Judge William Hart said staff had been ""clearly terrified"". ""A chilling aspect of that robbery is the way the gun was held,"" he said ''It's the last thing people would expect in a quiet takeaway in that part of the country."" He also took a red tin containing Â£250 in notes, two float bags containing Â£100 each and a bag of coins Speaking for the defence, Emma Martin said Batten was ""utterly ashamed and embarrassed"" by the way he had behaved. ""The lack of sophistication, the lack of any disguise are indicative of the desperation with which these offences were committed,"" she said. ""He had got himself involved in drink and drugs and with that comes the problem of paying for it."" Judge Hart also ordered the forfeiture and destruction of the imitation firearm, plus the forfeiture of the stolen money.

"The Co-op has become the latest supermarket chain to say it will stop selling plastic ""bags for life"". The retailer, which has 2,600 shops, said many people only used the 10p bags once before throwing them away. The Co-op said its move would take 29.5 million bags for life, or about 870 tonnes of plastic, out of circulation every year. Earlier this month,Morrisons said it would remove all plastic carrier bagsfrom its stores over the next year. The Co-op said it would replace the plastic bags with compostable carrier bags selling for 10p ""when current stocks are exhausted"". Co-op Food chief executive Jo Whitfield said the increased use of bags for life had led to a sharp rise in plastic use. ""With over 1.5 billion bags sold each year by retailers, this remains a massive issue for our industry as many shoppers are regularly buying so called 'Bags for Life' to use just once and it's leading toâ¯major hike in the amount of plastic being produced.""

The plastic bag levy, which is already 10p in Scotland, is set to double to 10p in England next month. However, the Co-op wants to see the minimum price for reusable bags being set at 50p, to encourage customers to use them more than once. It also wants all single-use carrier bags to be compostable. In addition, Ms Whitfield said: ""We believe that it should be mandatory for all retailers to report on the sales of all of their reusable bags, not just single-use bags. ""Right now, Co-op is the only major retailer to report on all of the bags it sells. This policy would enable a fuller understanding on the impact of the levy and its true effect on shopping behaviours when customers are making decisions at the tills."" Earlier this month, Morrisons said it would switch to using paper bags Earlier this month Morrisons said it would switch from offering plastic ""bags for life"" to a paper alternative. In recent years, all supermarkets have tried to cut plastics use. Waitrose is currently trialling the removal of its 10p bags for life from several of its stores. ""Our trial is ongoing but we're already seeing a drop in uptake in our bags, as intended, suggesting more of our customers at our eight trial stores are reusing them.

Clarke has starred in three series of Sky drama Bulletproof Clarke played a surveillance detective in the show, which has been on ITV every evening this week.

But Bafta added that it was ""an arts charity that is not in a position to properly investigate such matters"".

BBC MonitoringThe world through its media Russia's veterinary and phytosanitary watchdog says it is offering
free Covid-19 tests for pets whose owners
have had coronavirus. The watchdog, Rosselkhoznadzor,
says it isproviding the
tests,externalin 15 cities across Russia, including Moscow, as part of its
efforts to collect information on the prevalence of Covid-19 among animals. It says that the data will
allow scientists to study the likelihood of animal-to-animal transmission
as well as animal-to-human transmission. Last month, Rosselkhoznadzor announced it had
registered ""the world's first"" Covid-19 vaccine
for animals, called Carnivac-Cov. The watchdog's deputy
head Konstantin Savenkov
said at the time that the jab
had undergoneclinical
trials,externalon dogs, cats, mink and other animals - all
of which he said had developed antibodies to the virus. The first batch of 10,000
doses of Carnivac-Cov is to go on sale in early May, the state RIA Novosti news
agency has reported. According to the World Organisation
for Animal Health (OIE), several animal species havedemonstrated
susceptibility,externalto Covid-19, including following transmission
from infected humans. It identified farmed mink as
being particularly susceptible to the virus and says there have been some cases
of the animals transmitting the virus back to humans. Seven people have been arrested in India for allegedly selling fake remdesivir injections, Delhi police said. Remdesivir is an antiviral drug - originally developed to treat Ebola - that showed promising early results. However, in October 2020, the World Health Organization advised against its use for Covid, saying that it ""appeared to have little or no effect on hospitalised Covid"". Police got a tip-off and two of the group were arrested. During interrogation, they admitted that they were selling the fake injections on a higher price as its demand was shooting up due to the Covid crisis. Further raids were then made. A total of 198 vials of fake remdesivir, one packing machine and 3,000 empty vials to be used in packing of remdesivir were recovered, police said. A second wave of the virus is ravaging parts of India, with 386,452 new cases reported on Friday - the biggest one-day increase on record for any country. There were another 3,500 deaths nationwide and nearly 400 in Delhi - a record for the capital. India has registered more than 18 million Covid-19 cases and at least 200,000 deaths, amid an unfolding humanitarian disaster.

Mr Justice Hayden in the Court of Protection - where judges consider issues relating to people who lack the mental capacity to make decisions - was asked to make the ruling by the woman's appointed lawyer. The court heard much of her cognitive function had gone. She had never married and had no children. The woman, who cannot be identified but who is a former secretary at a factory in London, had been a long-term opponent of vaccines and would need to be restrained before being given an injection, the court was told. The judge said any attempt to restrain her and give her the vaccine would create ""a traumatic and disturbing scenario"" for her, for staff and other residents. âAlthough much of her cognitive function may have gone, her autonomy, and her own sense of it, continues,"" Mr Justice Hayden said, adding that it ""must be respected"". Surge testing is to be deployed in Redbridge after the identification of two cases of the Covid variant first found in South Africa. NHS Test and Trace will work with the local council to offer additional testing and genomic sequencing in the IG1 and IG6 postcode areas, as well as small parts of IG5 and IG7. Everybody aged 11 and over who lives or works in these postcodes is strongly encouraged to take a PCR test, whether they are showing symptoms or not. The confirmed cases, which are not being linked, are self-isolating and their contacts have been identified, the Department of Health says. Read more about surge testinghere.

The girl's legal case argues the face mask policy could cause ""serious harm"" A 12-year-old girl is suing her school in Sheffield to stop it ""requiring or encouraging"" the use of face masks. Her lawyers claim the masks policy ârisks causing children serious harmâ in terms of their mental and physical health. But the Tapton Academy School Trust, which runs the school, says it only encourages mask-wearing in line with government policy and only one pupil out of 1,000 has complained. The girl, known only as AB, has been exempted from wearing a mask but maintains the policy on masks could cause ""long-term"" harm. Representing AB, Francis Hoar said the school had failed to gather evidence on the effectiveness of masks and said there was ""no evidence, effectively"" that masks work in preventing transmission of the virus. Although AB is exempt, she is still ""faced with a school environment"" in which mask-wearing is enforced ""aggressively"", Mr Hoar said.

BBC MonitoringThe world through its media Russia's veterinary and phytosanitary watchdog says it is offering
free Covid-19 tests for pets whose owners
have had coronavirus. The watchdog, Rosselkhoznadzor,
says it isproviding the
tests,externalin 15 cities across Russia, including Moscow, as part of its
efforts to collect information on the prevalence of Covid-19 among animals. It says that the data will
allow scientists to study the likelihood of animal-to-animal transmission
as well as animal-to-human transmission. Last month, Rosselkhoznadzor announced it had
registered ""the world's first"" Covid-19 vaccine
for animals, called Carnivac-Cov. The watchdog's deputy

Remdesivir is an antiviral drug - originally developed to treat Ebola - that showed promising early results. However, in October 2020, the World Health Organization advised against its use for Covid, saying that it ""appeared to have little or no effect on hospitalised Covid"". Police got a tip-off and two of the group were arrested. During interrogation, they admitted that they were selling the fake injections on a higher price as its demand was shooting up due to the Covid crisis. Further raids were then made. A total of 198 vials of fake remdesivir, one packing machine and 3,000 empty vials to be used in packing of remdesivir were recovered, police said.

The Asuka II is carrying 295 passengers and 425 crew members. It will reach Yokohama tomorrow around noon, an NYK Cruises spokeswoman said. The infected passenger tested negative prior to the cruise, but then tested positive on board on Thursday, she said. They are stable and are isolating in a cabin, NYK said in a statement, adding that only one other person had been in close contact. The ship was due to stop in Aomori and Hokkaido, returning to port on 5 May. In February last year, hundreds of people on board the Diamond Princess cruise ship became infected with Covid-19 while it was held in quarantine off the port of Yokohama. A total of 14 people lost their lives. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Positive,0.71956325
"Faith and community leaders in the UK have united in grief with Israel after at least 45 people were killed in a crush at a crowded religious festival. The chief rabbi led tributes after the disaster at the Lag B'Omer celebration in the north-east of Israel. The Queen and PM Boris Johnson also sent condolences following the ""devastating scenes"" at the annual event, which left some 150 injured. Prayers will be said in at synagogues for the bereaved and the injured. Chief Rabbi Ephraim Mirvis said: ""As we struggle to come to terms with the horrific scenes of tragedy in Meron, the worst peacetime loss of life in Israel's history, this is a moment to unite in grief and prayer. ""May the memory of those lost to us forever be a blessing and may the injured be granted a refuah shelemah (a speedy recovery)."" The Queen sent a message to Israeli President Reuven Rivlin saying she was ""deeply saddened"", adding: ""My thoughts are with those who have been injured and the friends and families of those who have lost their lives. They have my deepest sympathy."" Witnesses tell of people 'thrown in air' What is the festival of Lag B'Omer? Tens of thousands of Orthodox Jews had attended the all-night festival, making it the largest event in Israel since the coronavirus pandemic began. Emergency officials said a crush had occurred at around 01:00 local time (22:00 GMT Thursday). It reportedly started after some attendees slipped on steps, causing dozens more to fall. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has travelled to the scene,said Sunday would be a day of national mourning. This video can not be played Footage shows chaotic scenes in the aftermath of the deadly religious festival crush Michael Goldstein, president of the United Synagogue - a union of British Orthodox Jewish synagogues - said the news from Israel was ""devastating"". ""We are heartbroken that a night of celebration could so quickly turn to a day of mourning. We share the pain of all the families who have lost a loved one,"" he said. Many people in the UK are already contacting organisations offering help and support. Magen David Adom UK - a British body set up to assist Israel's national medical emergency, disaster, ambulance and blood service Magen David Adom (MDA) - said it was already receiving calls and donations from the community. Chief executive Daniel Burger said: ""Throughout the night we have received updates from our colleagues in Israel, each more devastating than the one before. The horrific events at the Lag B'Omer celebrations in Meron have turned what should have been the happiest of nights into what will be the saddest of days."" He also called for blood donations from any Britons in Israel. ""The immediate concern is the blood supply in Israel,"" he said. ""MDA has put out an urgent request and we would urge any Brits on Gap Years or other programmes to go to their nearest blood donation centre and give blood."" The Board of Deputies of British Jews said a day intended for celebration would now be linked to mourning for the loved ones of those affected. Marie van der Zyl, president of the organisation, said: ""We are devastated at the news that a celebration for the festival of Lag B'Omer has led to such a tragic loss of life. ""Lag B'Omer traditionally celebrates the cessation of death of religious students from a terrible plague in Roman times. It is a bitter irony that the day will now become partly known as a day of mourning for the families affected."" Rabbi Celia Surget, chair of the Assembly of Reform Rabbi and Cantors, said she was ""devastated"" over the loss of life and sent wishes for healing for all those involved. Boris Johnson said on Twitter: ""Devastating scenes at the Lag B'Omer festival in Israel. My thoughts are with the Israeli people and those who have lost loved ones in this tragedy."" Others paying tribute included Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby and UK ambassador to Israel, Neil Wigan. Israeli ambassador to the UK, Tzipi Hotovely, said she sent ""condolences to the families of the deceased and my prayers to the wounded"". ""Let us pray for our Jewish brothers and sisters at this time of great grief,"" she added. ""May the memory of those lost be a blessing."" Chaotic scenes at festival site.

"Coastal properties have become increasingly popular UK house prices rose by 7.1% compared with a year ago, the Nationwide has said, prompting one analyst to suggest the market is ""on the boil"". The building society said the average property price had risen by Â£15,916 in the last year, to reach Â£238,831. The Nationwide said increased savings during lockdown meant some first-time buyers would be better placed to afford a home. But prices could continue to rise as homes available did not match demand. Lucy Pendleton, from independent estate agents James Pendleton, said: ""This market is on the boil. ""Silly season might be just around the corner. That's when a seller's market becomes entrenched against a backdrop of very high demand and you start to see open houses for properties that are nothing special and a return of gazumping."" 'Trying to buy a house in this market is painful' When does the stamp duty holiday extension end? Foxtons to review boss's pay after investor revolt How Covid has changed where we want to live The Nationwide said that prices rose sharply in April, up by 2.1% compared with March. Year-on-year price growth accelerated as well, driven in part by the extension instamp duty holidaysin England, Wales and Northern Ireland. The pandemic has led some people to reassess their domestic set-up, with demand for more space coming to the fore. ""Our research suggests that while thestamp duty holidayis impacting the timing of housing transactions, for most people it is not the key motivating factor prompting them to move in the first place,"" said Nationwide's chief economist, Robert Gardner. The state of the market saw some people queuing overnight outside an estate agent in Wales as homes for a new development went onto the market. This video can not be played Aberdare: Buyers queue overnight as a new development is marketed Nationwide's figures are based on its own mortgage data, and it suggests that the market is likely to continue to be busy for the next six months, owing to the stamp duty relief. Price growth was also likely to accelerate, it said, with demand expected to exceed the supply of homes on the market. That is generally bad news for first-time buyers, but the building society said some - with the help of their families - would be in a better position having had the opportunity to save money during the pandemic. A typical first-time buyer would need to save Â£19,500, or around 50% of their gross earnings, for a 10% deposit on a mortgage, Mr Gardner said. ""The fact that around a third of first time buyers in England in 2018-19 said that friends or family helped them to raise a deposit through a loan or gift suggests that the recent surge in savings will help some, but that the impact won't be spread evenly,"" he said. On the same day,Barclays boss Jes Staley saidthat built-up savings would help to create the biggest economic boom since the aftermath of World War Two in the UK. The Nationwide said that the longer-term outlook for the housing market was more ""uncertain"". ""If unemployment rises sharply towards the end of the year as most analysts expect, there is scope for activity to slow, perhaps sharply,"" Mr Gardner said. Nicky Stevenson, managing director at estate agent Fine & Country, said: ""Numbers like this won't last forever but the market may not begin to unwind until the busy summer season is out of the way.""

Apple faces a large fine and may be forced to change its policies if its arguments do not convince regulators. Previously it has denied any wrong-doing. The case is looking specifically at how its App Store policies affect music streaming. The charge was initially filed in 2019 by co-founder of Spotify Daniel Ek, who said that Apple was ""limiting choice and stifling innovation"". ""Apple's rules distort competition in the market for music streaming by raising the costs of competing music streaming app developers. This in turn leads to higher prices for consumers for their in-app music subscriptions on iOS devices,"" an EC statement said. In response, Apple said it did not receive any commission on 99% of Spotify's subscribers. ""At the core of this case is Spotify's demand they should be able to advertise alternative deals on their iOS app, a practice that no store in the world allows,"" it said in a statement. ""Once again, they want all the benefits of the App Store but don't think they should have to pay anything for that. The Commission's argument on Spotify's behalf is the opposite of fair competition."" Alexander Holland, chief content and strategy officer at music streaming platform Deezer said he was pleased with the Commission's findings. ""It's an important step towards a fair competitive landscape where dominant market players like Apple have to compete with independent companies like Deezer on quality of service, innovation and consumer experience, rather than artificially created barriers and a lack of a level playing field."" Earlier Ms Vestager tweeted that the preliminary conclusion of the EC was that ""Apple was in breach of EU competition law"" and ""charges high commission fees on rivals in the App Store and forbids them to inform of alternatives"".

EC and US regulators have a series of ongoing investigations into Apple's App Store including more widely considering whether the 30% commission it charges for in-app purchases is fair. Developers have become increasingly frustrated by the so-called Apple tax. Under pressure from both developers and regulators, Apple has cut its commission rate to 15% for any developer than earns less than Â£1m in annual revenue. A complaint was filed to the EC by e-commerce firm Rakuten in March 2020,  alleging that it was anti-competitive to take a commission on e-books sold through the App Store while promoting its own Apple Books service. This case will be looked at separately. Epic Games, the makers of Fortnite, also filed a similar complaint as part of an ongoing dispute with Apple over its 30% cut on in-app purchases. It led to Apple removing the game from its App Store. A court case between the two opens in the US next week and promises to reveal much about Apple's inner workings. It will see testimony from Apple chief executive Tim Cook and Epic chief Tim Sweeney.

"This video can not be played Footage shows chaotic scenes in the aftermath of the crush at the religious festival At least 44 people have been killed in a crush at a crowded religious festival in the north-east of Israel. Dozens more were injured at the Lag B'Omer celebration, which takes place annually at the foot of Mount Meron. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu travelled to the scene and said Sunday would be a day of national mourning. Tens of thousands of Orthodox Jews attended the all-night festival, making it the largest event in Israel since the coronavirus pandemic began. The country's successful vaccination programme has allowed it to lift many restrictions, but health officials had still warned of the risk of Covid-19. Witnesses: 'People were thrown up in the air' Early reports suggested a structure at the site had collapsed, but emergency officials later said a crush had occurred at around 01:00 local time (22:00 GMT Thursday). Police sources told Haaretz newspaper that it started after some attendees slipped on steps, which caused dozens more to fall. Witnesses said some people fell down a crowded set of steps ""It happened in a split second; people just fell, trampling each other. It was a disaster,""one witness told the newspaper,external. Videos posted online show thousands of people struggling to flee through a narrow passageway. Loudhailer messages urged the crowds to disperse, before police requested the full evacuation of the site. ""No-one imagined that this could happen here,"" one pilgrim told Channel 12 TV. ""Rejoicing became mourning, a great light became a deep darkness."" Dozens of ambulances attended the scene as emergency services laid out bodies under foil covers on the ground. Helicopters took the injured to hospital, while the military said search-and-rescue troops had also been deployed. At least 150 people were injured, officials said, including38 people who were in critical condition at the site,external. The festival attracted tens of thousands of attendees Children were also caught up in the disaster, and witnesses said paramedics were seen performing CPR on some of them. Earlier in the day, officials said they were not able to enforce coronavirus restrictions owing to the huge crowds. Police reportedly said they had arrested two people for disrupting their efforts to keep order before the crush occurred. Israel is a nation in shock.  This is the worst civilian disaster in its modern history. Questions are being asked about how an annual celebration turned into such a tragedy. Police - who were in charge of public security at the site - are used to even bigger numbers turning up and they are already facing criticism. They have launched their own investigation. At Mount Meron, there are still chaotic scenes and hundreds of buses are trying to transport the attendees away. Meanwhile, many families have struggled to get news of their loved ones due to overburdened phone services. Some bodies are yet to be identified and funerals are not expected to take place until after the Jewish Sabbath, which begins at sunset. Leading rabbis have called for prayers to support the bereaved and injured. Witnesses have described the panic as the crush began to unfold. ""It was crowded and there [was]... no place to move,"" one attendee told the BBC. ""People started to fall on the ground."" ""All of a sudden we saw paramedics... running by,"" another attendee, Shlomo Katz, said. ""One after the other [they] started coming out... Then we understood that something is going on here."" ""Over 1,000 people together tried to go down a very, very small place, very narrow road and they just fell on top of each other,"" said Yanki Farber, a reporter with the Orthodox Jewish website Behadrei Haredim. An emergency worker told AFP news agency that he saw ""dozens of people fall on top of one another"" and ""a large number of them were crushed and lost consciousness"". ""I have not seen anything like this since I entered into the field of emergency medicine,"" Lazar Hyman, a volunteer rescue worker, told AFP. Another first responder, Dov Maisel, told the BBC: ""We just finished treating one of Israel's worst disasters. ""A terrible disaster of people who came to celebrate... and unfortunately were literally crushed to death,"" he said. Benjamin Netanyahu visits the scene in Mount Meron. He called the deaths a ""heavy disaster"" Tens of thousands of Orthodox Jews make a pilgrimage to Meron each year for Lag B'Omer, a religious holiday marked with all-night bonfires, prayer and dancing. The town is the site of the tomb of Rabbi Shimon Bar Yochai, a revered Second-Century sage, who ordained that the anniversary of his death be commemorated with a celebration of his life. The site is mostly gender-segregated. Images and video suggest the crush happened in one of the men's sections. According to the Times of Israel, organisers estimated that 100,000 people arrived on Thursday night. Attendance was higher than last year, when the festival was held under restrictions due to the coronavirus pandemic. But it was still smaller than in previous years, when hundreds of thousands of people took part. Were you in the area? Did you witness what happened?

"This video can not be played Survivors have told of hearing people scream underneath them Families in Israel have begun burying their loved ones after at least 45 people died in a crush at a crowded Jewish festival overnight. Some 150 people were also injured at the Lag B'Omer festival, near Mount Meron, when people became trapped in an overcrowded passageway. Funerals were allowed to take place for victims who were positively identified. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu promised that an inquiry would ensure such a tragedy did not happen again. Visiting the scene, he said it was one of the worst peacetime disasters the country had known. One survivor who gave his name as David told Ynet news it had felt like a human wave had broken: ""Our bodies were swept along by themselves. People were thrown up in the air - others were crushed on the ground."" Medics struggled to reach the injured in the ensuing chaos. Witnesses: 'People were thrown up in the air' What is the Lag B'Omer festival? Those who died are believed to be predominantly men or boys from the ultra-Orthodox community as the crush at the largely gender-segregated event apparently happened in one of the men's sections. Mourners attended a funeral ceremony in Jerusalem Some victims are believed to be foreign nationals. Israeli airline El Al has offered to assist family members of victims living abroad who wish to attend their loved ones' funerals in Israel. Sunday has been declared a national day of mourning. Bodies of the dead were taken to the Greenberg Institute of Forensic Medicine in Tel Aviv, which had identified 32 before the process was halted for 24 hours on Friday evening for observance of the Sabbath. One of the first funerals to be reported was that of Rabbi Elazar Goldberg, who was in his late thirties. Mourners in Jerusalem prayed, some wept, as the body covered in a white sheet was moved into the back of a vehicle ahead of burial, Reuters news agency reports. Women comfort each other at a funeral in Bnei Brak A funeral took place at Segula cemetery in the town of Petah Tikva Two of the youngest victims were brothers Moshe Natan Englander, 14, and Yehoshua Englander, 9, from Jerusalem. At least two of the dead are US citizens from New York, Congressman Mondaire Jones confirmed in a tweet. Israeli President Reuven Rivlin lit 45 candles on Friday afternoon to commemorate the dead, the Jerusalem Post reports. ""This is the time to hug the families and to help them find their loved ones - to cry together,"" he said. ""This is a hard and painful day. This tragedy is heartbreaking."" The site includes several large gathering grounds with open-air stands and stages, connected by a network of paths. It was along one of those paths where witnesses said the crush of people began at around 01:00 local time (22:00 GMT Thursday). Some witnesses said the incident had begun when police closed the passageway, said to be 3m (10ft) wide. Police sources told Haaretz newspaper some people had slipped on steps, causing dozens more to fall over. This was not officially confirmed. An injured man lying on a hospital bed said a line of people in the front of the surging crowd had simply collapsed. Benjamin Netanyahu visited the scene in Mount Meron. He called the deaths a ""heavy disaster"" ""A pyramid of one on top of another was formed,"" the unnamed man was quoted as saying by Reuters news agency. ""People were piling up one on top of the other. I was in the second row. The people in the first row - I saw people die in front of my eyes."" Dov Maisel, director of operations for volunteer-based emergency services organisation United Hatzalah, told the BBC he had never witnessed such a scene in his 30-year career. ""It felt like a surreal scene where we had over 20 people undergoing CPR by our teams, with limited ability to evacuate from the scene, simply because the place was too overwhelmed with people,"" he said. Witnesses say a police barricade prevented people from leaving the crowded area. The festival was taking place near the tomb of the 2nd Century sage Rabbi Shimon Bar Yochai Israel's state watchdog, the State Comptroller's office, issued warnings in 2008 and 2011 of the risk of a disaster. Special danger was posed by access roads and paths which ""are narrow and not appropriate to accommodate the hundreds of thousands of people who visit the site"", the office wasquoted as saying by the New York Times,external. What was different this year was that bonfire areas were partitioned off as a Covid-19 precaution and this may have created unexpected choke-points for foot traffic, Reuters reports, quoting Israeli media. Thousands of police officers closed down the event after the crush before helping evacuate attendees. Investigators will look into whether there was any police misconduct, the justice ministry said. Mr Netanyahu promised a ""serious"" investigation that ""would ensure this kind of disaster never happens again"". Some witnesses said people fell down a narrow staircase before the crush Regional police chief Shimon Lavi told reporters at the scene he took upon himself ""the overall responsibility, for good and for bad"" and was ""ready for every inspection"". He later told AFP news agency his officers had done all they could on a ""tragic night"". Other police officials told local media people had slipped in the walkway and the crush had been ""out of their control"". An unnamed police source told Haaretz the incident could not have been prevented,externaland the police were not to blame. US President Joe Biden called Prime Minister Netanyahu to offer his condolences. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said his thoughts were with ""the Israeli people and those who have lost loved ones in this tragedy"" and German Chancellor Angela and offered her ""heartfelt sympathies"". UK sends messages of grief and support At the disaster site, men come in their dozens. Some pray. Others stand in groups, exchange short words and point to where tragedy unfolded. I walk down the ramp from the top of the slope where the crowd swelled. It is made of metal, with no steps, and eyewitness say it was wet and slippery. Then the narrow passageway turns hard to the right and there are steep steps. One man points down them. ""The police, they put barriers there!"" he says, anger rising in his voice. People say they could not get out as the crowd at the top, unaware, carried on coming. Jewish pilgrims travel here in their hundreds of thousands for blessings at the shrine of a rabbi from antiquity. Instead, this year they met panic and a deadly crush. And now this holy site witnesses an unplanned, mass evacuation. The festival was cancelled, and people are being bused out in their tens of thousands. Rescue workers collected the lost belongings of those caught up in the crush Were you in the area? Did you witness what happened? Share your experiences by emailinghaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external.

"More than 127,000 people have died with Covid-19 About 22 million people in the UK are living in areas that have not reported any Covid-19 deaths that happened in April, according to BBC News analysis. By comparison, in a four-week period during January's peak, fewer than 50,000 people lived in such places. The findings were greeted as ""really good news [which] give us confidence"" by one expert. The government has urged people to keep following restrictions and have the Covid vaccine when called. The BBC's data analysis reveals the extent of the improvement since January's peak. Fewer than 600 deaths within 28 days of a positive test have been reported so far this month, compared with more than 30,000 in the first four weeks of January. How many coronavirus cases are there in your area? How many people have been vaccinated so far? The figures suggest the UK's pandemic is moving into a new phase, with many areas seeing low levels of coronavirus. The latest lockdown and the vaccination programme have successfully reduced cases, and as a result, deaths. ""This is really good news,"" said Dr Mike Tildesley, an expert in the spread of infectious diseases. ""It's a really good sign and we've seen several parts of the country where prevalence is really, really low. So, I think it gives us confidence."" But he echoed another expert who urged caution. ""[W]e have seen before, when things go wrong they can go wrong quickly,"" said Prof Graham Medley, of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. Slowly lifting restrictions means this is less likely to happen, he added. Areas that did not report any April deaths tended to have fewer confirmed coronavirus cases in March, the data suggests. On average, those places had 150 cases per 100,000 people in March. By comparison, districts that have reported deaths in April had just under 240 positive cases per 100,000 people in March. Some parts have gone even longer without seeing Covid deaths. Plymouth, a major city and home to more than a quarter-of-a-million people, has not reported a Covid death in the last 58 days. In Oxford and Maidstone it's 60 days. But the 19 worst-hit councils accounted for more than a third of the deaths occurring in April. The areas with the highest death rates include two in Northern Ireland: Mid and East Antrim, and Antrim and Newtownabbey, as well as Sedgemoor in Somerset and Bradford, West Yorkshire. Scientists advising the government believe that the focus in the coming months will turn to identifying and containing local and regional outbreaks. How much longer until I can meet friends inside? How old do I have to be to get my vaccine? Postcode check: How are the rules changing for you? There are some differences in the figures from 1-28 April across the UK. Some 56% of local authorities in Scotland reported no deaths - only Glasgow reported more than nine In England, 44% of local authorities in 138 areas across all regions did not report deaths, suggesting the situation is improving nationwide In Northern Ireland, 9% of authorities reported no deaths, and a further 55% reported only one Every local health board in Wales, which represent many more people than councils, reported at least two deaths, but only Betsi Cadwaladr reported more than seven A modern browser with JavaScript and a stable internet connection are required to view this interactive. Enter a full UK postcode or council name to find out  These figures are based on deaths that occurred within 28 days of a positive test. There is usually a delay in reporting deaths, so the official numbers for April will increase, but by this point in March, more than 90% of the month's deaths had been reported. The Office for National Statistics records deaths in a different way, and under this definition more areas may have seen fatalities. Despite the surge in areas with zero deaths, a government spokesperson encouraged people ""to follow the rules so that our roadmap out of lockdown is irreversible"". ""We urge everyone to keep coming forward to get their vaccine when called. This is the best way to keep each other safe and see our roadmap through in full."" In other developments: Aboutone in 1,010 people in households in Englandhad coronavirus in the week to 24 April - down from one in 610 the week before, according to estimates from the latest infection survey by the Office for National Statistics People aged 40 and over in Englandare now able to book their Covid jabs, the NHS has said. Since the vaccine rollout began in December, about 34 million people in the UK have had at least one dose, with more than 14 million people having now had two jabs Shops, gyms, pubs, restaurants and cafes in Northern Irelandwill reopen on Friday after a four-month winter lockdown Liverpool is hosting a government-organisedlive music event as part of a Covid safety pilot on Friday, ahead of a full lifting of restrictions later in the year.

"The government has defended its handling of the crisis amid mounting criticism Officials in Delhi have been urged to find more sites for cremations as the city's morgues and crematoriums are overwhelmed by masses of Covid deaths. A second wave of the virus is ravaging parts of India, with 386,452 new cases reported on Friday - the biggest one-day increase on record for any country. There were another 3,500 deaths nationwide and nearly 400 in Delhi - a record for the capital. The total number of infections in the country has now passed 18 million. The first consignment of emergency medical supplies from the US arrived on Friday, part of what the White House has said will be more than $100m (Â£72m) worth of support. But oxygen supplies and hospital beds remain in desperately short supply across India, with relatives of Covid patients pleading on social media for help. One senior Delhi police officer said that people were having to cremate family members in crematoriums not designated to take victims of Covid-19. ""That's why we suggested more crematoriums should be set up,"" the officer told the NDTV news channel. India's Health Ministry released detailed guidelines last year for the handling and cremation of people who have died of Covid, with special measures needing to be taken to avoid any potential reinfection. 'We try to save a patient until the last breath' US tells citizens to leave India amid Covid crisis Why can't Australians get back into their country? India elections go ahead as deaths hit record high India's central government is facing mounting criticism over its handling of the pandemic and its decision to allow large election rallies and religious festivals to go ahead in recent weeks. On Friday, the country's Supreme Court defended the rights of citizens to express grievances and appeal for help on social media during the current coronavirus crisis, warning actions by the authorities to stop people doing so would be treated as contempt of court. It comes afterTwitter was asked to remove a number of postswhich were critical of the government earlier this week. This video can not be played 'A person cannot even die peacefully in Delhi' The health minister defended the government on Thursday, saying the country's fatality rate was the lowest in the world and that oxygen supplies were ""adequate"". Harsh Vardhan told ANI news agency that oxygen was now ""being made available from many sources"", including from abroad, and that storage and cryogenic tankers were also being prepared. A US military plane landed in Delhi on Friday morning, loaded with almost one million rapid Covid tests and 100,000 N95 masks. The White House has said it will donate 15 million N95 masks in total. Jeremy Konyndyk, the executive director of the Covid task force at the US Agency for International Development, told AFP news agency that their first priority was to address India's most ""immediate needs"". The UK also donated ventilators to India earlier this week. However, many experts in India say more is needed. On Tuesday, Mumbai-based Dr Zarir Udwadia told the BBC that the aid being offered was ""a drop in an ocean"". On Saturday, all adults above the age of 18 in India will become eligible for vaccination, but there are widespread concerns about the availability of shots. India is the world's biggest producer of vaccines but does not have enough stock for the estimated 800 million people who will become eligible. So far, fewer than 10% of people in India have had a Covid vaccination. A number of states are reporting shortages of the vaccine. On Thursday, Delhi's health minister Satyendar Jain said the capital had run out of doses, and that they were waiting for fresh supplies from private companies. Oxygen and hospital beds remain in short supply, with people making pleas on social media for their sick relatives India's financial capital, Mumbai, home to more than 20 million people, has suspended its vaccination drive for three days due to ""depletion of available vaccines"", the local authority said in a statement. The municipal commissioner of Mumbai, Ashwini Bhide, said on Twitter that the city would reserve current stocks for people aged over 45 years old. This could lead to another crisis. On 1 May, another 40 million people will already be in the queue for their second dose. For the vaccines being administered in India, it is currently recommended that people get their second dose four to eight weeks after the first.

He said he had ""never had a complaint made against me"" in 20 years Fellow Bulletproof actorAshley Walters responded to the allegations,externalagainst his co-star by saying he was ""in shock and deeply saddened by what I have heard on a multitude of levels"". He said he ""could never condone behaviour of this nature"" and while ""Noel has been a friend and a colleague for several years, I cannot stand by and ignore these allegations"". He added: ""Sexual harassment, abuse and bullying have no place in our industry."" In his statement on Thursday, Clarke added: ""In a 20-year career, I have put inclusivity and diversity at the forefront of my work and never had a complaint made against me. ""If anyone who has worked with me has ever felt uncomfortable or disrespected, I sincerely apologise."" Clarke has alsobeen suspended by Bafta, weeks after he received one of the British film and TV academy's top awards. He was given the outstanding British contribution to cinema prize at a ceremony on 10 April. In a letter sent to its members on Friday, Bafta defended its decision to go ahead with the presentation despite having received emails about Clarke's behaviour before the ceremony. ""These were either anonymous or second or third-hand accounts via intermediaries,"" it said. ""No first-hand allegations were sent to us. No names, times, dates, productions or other details were ever provided. ""Had the victims gone on record as they have with The Guardian, the award would have been suspended immediately. Noel Clarke's counsel received a legal notice to this effect. It was always very clear what our intentions would be."" Clarke won his first Bafta for Rising Star in 2009 The organisation described the allegations as ""extremely serious"" and said the alleged behaviour was ""contrary to Bafta's values and everything it stands for"". ""We completely understand why the individuals were extremely fearful to identify themselves to us, and we recognise how hard it is for victims to speak up,"" it said. But Bafta added that it was ""an arts charity that is not in a position to properly investigate such matters"". Actor, writer and director Michaela Coel was among those praising the women who spoke out in the Guardian, and the journalists for their investigation. ""Speaking out about these incidents takes a lot of strength,""she wrote on Friday,external. Meanwhile, production company All3Media, which backs Clarke's own company Unstoppable Film and TV, said: ""We take allegations of this kind extremely seriously and are looking into this as a matter of urgency."" Paul Fleming, general secretary of arts union Equity, said it had been ""a difficult day for those who run the industry"". ""It's a phenomenally embarrassing and traumatic 24 hours if you're a gatekeeper and in charge of what goes on in our members' workplace,"" he told BBC Radio 4's PM Programme. ""It really does take something to be here, [the] best part of four years on from #MeToo and still be asking these questions. ""And for big bosses, big producers to have not put in place the polices practises and cultures in workplaces that allow these things to be considered credibleâ¦ ""This is a really, really damning indictment of how intimidating some workplaces and some producers are for our members to raise concerns.""

"This video can not be played Jes Staley says the second half of 2021 ""will be quite something"" The UK is about to experience its biggest economic boom since the aftermath of World War Two, according to Barclays boss Jes Staley. His upbeat assessment came as Barclays revealed its profits for the first three months of this year had more than doubled from a year earlier to Â£2.4bn. ""We estimate the UK economy will grow at its fastest rate since 1948. That's pretty spectacular,"" he said. The vaccine programme and built-up savings will help to drive the rebound. Mr Staley said that a combination of the successful vaccine rollout and Barclays' estimate of an extra Â£200bn sitting in customer and company bank accounts meant the UK would join the US in seeing some of the fastest economic growth in decades. The boost in Barclays' latest profits was almost entirely driven by a more confident view on how many of its loans would be repaid. This time last year, the bank set aside more than Â£2bn to cover the risks that borrowers would be unable to repay all of their debts. This time round they are setting aside just Â£55m. Interestingly, Barclays - unlike other big banks in the UK and US - have decided not to adjust previous estimates of bad loan previsions, but hinted that they will do so in future. It will be equally interesting to watch just how much of their total Â£9bn kitty for future estimated debt defaults they are prepared to reconsider. Jes Staley predicts pent up shopper demand will be released as the economy reopens Assuming the worst regarding future defaults is sometimes called ""stuffing the cookie jar"" - a jar that can be raided when needed to boost future earnings. All banks do this to a greater or lesser degree, But Mr Staley seems convinced that despite virus-related disasters in developing economies such as India and new lockdowns in developed counties such as Japan, the overall picture looks to be improving. He also concedes that many business sectors (like hospitality and leisure) have faced desperately challenging circumstances and it is unclear how many of the five million workers still on furlough can expect to return to full-time work. There are many business owners who will not recognise the rosy picture he paints of the UK's economic future. It is probably wrong to talk in terms of an economic boom after we have seen the biggest economic downturn in 300 years, but Mr Staley is in tune with his US counterparts when he hopes and expects that, for him and his many business customers, the worst is behind us.

"People aged 40 and over in England are now able tobook their Covid jabs,external, NHS officials say. Text messages will be sent to 40 and 41-year-olds, directing them to the national booking service. Meanwhile, about 22 million people in the UK are living in areas thathave not reported any Covid deaths that happened in April, BBC analysis shows. Since the vaccine rollout began in December, about 34 million people have had at least one dose in the UK. This equates to nearly two-thirds of the adult population. More than 14 million people have now had two Covid jabs. The extension of the rollout comes just days aftervaccinations were opened to 42-year-olds in England. When will I get my vaccine? How many people have been vaccinated so far? NHS England chief executive Sir Simon Stevens said: ""With nine-tenths of people aged 45 and over having been jabbed, nearly three-quarters of a million new appointments were made in just two days as our booking service opened to people aged 42 to 44."" This video can not be played After phase one is complete by mid-April, in what order will all other adults get the jab? It comes as fewer than 600 deaths within 28 days of a positive test have been reported so far this month, compared with more than 30,000 in the first four weeks of January. The latest lockdown, together with the vaccination programme, have successfully reduced cases, and as a result deaths. Dr Mike Tildesley, an expert in the spread on infectious diseases, said it was ""really good news"". ""It's a really good sign and we've seen several parts of the country where prevalence is really, really low. So, I think it gives us confidence."" But he echoed another expert who urged caution. ""[We] have seen before, when things go wrong they can go wrong quickly,"" said Prof Graham Medley, of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. Lifting restrictions slowly means this is less likely to happen, he added. People who cannot access the booking service online can call the service on 119 to book a vaccination appointment. Northern Ireland has opened its vaccination programme to 35 to 39-year-olds. Wales, meanwhile, has been offering jabs to the over-40s, as well as younger peoplein some areas. And Scotland has been inviting 45 to 49-year-olds. The government plans to offer a first vaccine dose to the rest of the adult population by the end of July. The NHS currently uses three vaccines against coronavirus: Pfizer-BioNTech Oxford-AstraZeneca Moderna And the government has ordered an extra 60 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine as part of its plans for a vaccination booster programme in the autumn. NEW VARIANTS:How worried should we be? GLOBAL SPREAD:How many worldwide cases are there? COVID IMMUNITY:Can you catch it twice? VACCINE:When will I get the jab? It comes asLiverpool prepares to host a government-organised live music event as part of a Covid safety pilotto check what impact easing the rules will have ahead of a full lifting of restrictions later in the year. An indoor club night for around 3,000 people will take place at Circus Nightclub with no social distancing and no face coverings under the government's Events Research Programme (ERP), which will explore the risk of transmission and the effectiveness of measures such as ventilation and testing. Meanwhile,shops, gyms, pubs, restaurants and cafes in Northern Irelandwill reopen on Friday after a four-month winter lockdown. Hospitality businesses must only operate outdoors, with table service and limited numbers per table. Caravans and self-contained tourist accommodation can also now reopen. Restrictions on meeting up outside have also been slightly further eased, with 15 people from three households allowed to meet in a private garden. Have you recently been offered the vaccine?

"Coastal properties have become increasingly popular UK house prices rose by 7.1% compared with a year ago, the Nationwide has said, prompting one analyst to suggest the market is ""on the boil"". The building society said the average property price had risen by Â£15,916 in the last year, to reach Â£238,831. The Nationwide said increased savings during lockdown meant some first-time buyers would be better placed to afford a home. But prices could continue to rise as homes available did not match demand. Lucy Pendleton, from independent estate agents James Pendleton, said: ""This market is on the boil. ""Silly season might be just around the corner. That's when a seller's market becomes entrenched against a backdrop of very high demand and you start to see open houses for properties that are nothing special and a return of gazumping."" 'Trying to buy a house in this market is painful' When does the stamp duty holiday extension end? Foxtons to review boss's pay after investor revolt How Covid has changed where we want to live The Nationwide said that prices rose sharply in April, up by 2.1% compared with March. Year-on-year price growth accelerated as well, driven in part by the extension instamp duty holidaysin England, Wales and Northern Ireland. The pandemic has led some people to reassess their domestic set-up, with demand for more space coming to the fore. ""Our research suggests that while thestamp duty holidayis impacting the timing of housing transactions, for most people it is not the key motivating factor prompting them to move in the first place,"" said Nationwide's chief economist, Robert Gardner. The state of the market saw some people queuing overnight outside an estate agent in Wales as homes for a new development went onto the market. This video can not be played Aberdare: Buyers queue overnight as a new development is marketed Nationwide's figures are based on its own mortgage data, and it suggests that the market is likely to continue to be busy for the next six months, owing to the stamp duty relief. Price growth was also likely to accelerate, it said, with demand expected to exceed the supply of homes on the market. That is generally bad news for first-time buyers, but the building society said some - with the help of their families - would be in a better position having had the opportunity to save money during the pandemic.

"Coastal properties have become increasingly popular UK house prices rose by 7.1% compared with a year ago, the Nationwide has said, prompting one analyst to suggest the market is ""on the boil"". The building society said the average property price had risen by Â£15,916 in the last year, to reach Â£238,831. The Nationwide said increased savings during lockdown meant some first-time buyers would be better placed to afford a home. But prices could continue to rise as homes available did not match demand. Lucy Pendleton, from independent estate agents James Pendleton, said: ""This market is on the boil. ""Silly season might be just around the corner. That's when a seller's market becomes entrenched against a backdrop of very high demand and you start to see open houses for properties that are nothing special and a return of gazumping."" 'Trying to buy a house in this market is painful' When does the stamp duty holiday extension end? Foxtons to review boss's pay after investor revolt How Covid has changed where we want to live The Nationwide said that prices rose sharply in April, up by 2.1% compared with March. Year-on-year price growth accelerated as well, driven in part by the extension instamp duty holidaysin England, Wales and Northern Ireland. The pandemic has led some people to reassess their domestic set-up, with demand for more space coming to the fore. ""Our research suggests that while thestamp duty holidayis impacting the timing of housing transactions, for most people it is not the key motivating factor prompting them to move in the first place,"" said Nationwide's chief economist, Robert Gardner. The state of the market saw some people queuing overnight outside an estate agent in Wales as homes for a new development went onto the market. This video can not be played Aberdare: Buyers queue overnight as a new development is marketed Nationwide's figures are based on its own mortgage data, and it suggests that the market is likely to continue to be busy for the next six months, owing to the stamp duty relief.

"Actor and director Noel Clarke has been suspended by Bafta after allegations of sexual harassment, weeks after he received one of its top awards. In a statement, Bafta said it made the decision ""in light of the allegations of serious misconduct""in the Guardian,external. The Kidulthood and Doctor Who actor, 45, was given the outstanding British contribution to cinema prize at a ceremony on 10 April. Clarke has said he ""vehemently"" denies ""any sexual misconduct or wrongdoing"". In a statement he said he intended to ""defend myself against these false allegations"". He added: ""In a 20-year career, I have put inclusivity and diversity at the forefront of my work and never had a complaint made against me. ""If anyone who has worked with me has ever felt uncomfortable or disrespected, I sincerely apologise."" The Guardian reported allegations from 20 women, all of whom knew Clarke in a professional capacity. Bafta said it was suspending his membership and the recently awarded honour ""immediately and until further notice"". Clarke plays the lead role in ITV police drama Viewpoint, which is scheduled to conclude on Friday night Clarke is currently appearing in the successful ITV police drama Viewpoint, a five-part series with episodes airing each evening this week. Its finale is scheduled to be broadcast later. He wrote and starred in the acclaimed film trilogy Kidulthood, Adulthood and Brotherhood - which offered an uncompromising depiction of teenage life on the streets of west London - and directed two of them. The actor and producer, from London, was first recognised by Bafta in 2009, when he won the rising star prize. His first major on-screen role was in Channel 4 drama-comedy Metrosexuality in 2001. In Doctor Who, Clarke played Mickey Smith, the series' first-ever black companion, to the 10th doctor, played by David Tennant. Clarke co-created and starred in the Sky police procedural drama Bulletproof with actor Ashley Walters. He is married to Iris Da Silva, a cosmetic designer, and the couple have three sons. When approached for comment, management and production company 42 M&P said it no longer represented Clarke. Have you been affected by the issues raised in this story?

"Bars and restaurants are struggling to recruit enough staff and some may not be able to fully reopen in May, after thousands of workers left the sector. Venue owners say they are expecting huge demand from customers, but staff shortages may mean they have to limit opening hours. Figures suggest more than one in ten UK hospitality workers left the industry in the last year. Recruitment site Caterer.com said the pandemic and Brexit were to blame. Some have managed to find alternative employment, but a high proportion may have left the UK altogether, the recruiter said. So, although many hospitality workers were laid off during the last 12 months, restaurateurs are now finding it hard to fill places. Celebrity chef Michael Caines is one of those finding recruitment difficult. He operates two restaurants on the Cornish coast and a hotel in Exmouth. A beach bar and restaurant in Exmouth is also due to open. He is currently trying to hire 20 new staff members across the group. ""Without question, recruitment is a challenge,"" he said. ""All of the businesses are extremely busy. For the next three, four months our hotel is completely booked up, so we're desperately trying to recruit enough staff."" Mr Caines said Brexit and the pandemic have led European workers to leave and not return, but he said another problem is the number of workers still on furlough. While they are waiting to return to work they are less willing to switch employers. ""A lot of people feel very concerned about leaving a job where they qualify for furlough to take the new job where they wouldn't qualify for furlough if there was another lockdown,"" he explained. ""So there's a bit of nervousness from an employee's point of view."" Mr Caines is hoping roles will be more easily filled when students break up from college and university and start looking for summer work. Only two in five pubs in England reopen Is England's cafÃ© culture set for a boost? 'The deer have been roaming around the lawn' Restaurants and bars have been allowed to serve food and drink outdoors since 12 April, while indoor dining is expected to restart from 17 May. And many UK hospitality venues are hoping pent-up demand and a more UK-focused holiday season to translate into a bumper summer. As a result, recruitment was a ""growing issue"", said UK Hospitality chief executive Kate Nicholls. It was more acute in some areas, such as London, than others, she added, and could mean some venues struggle to reopen. The trade association said chef vacancies are among the most difficult to fill. But restaurant owners have reported staff shortages across all types of roles. Specialist recruiter, Caterer.com, said the number of vacancies on its website had grown by more than 85% in the last few weeks, with 22,000 roles now being advertised. But it pointed tofigures from the Office for National Statistics,externalsuggesting 355,000 fewer people were employed in hospitality than a year ago. Pre-pandemic around 3.2 million were employed in the sector including bars, restaurants and hotels. ""Many restaurants, pubs and bars have experienced a sudden surge in business due to built-up customer demand and an increase in consumer confidence which is great news for the hospitality industry,"" said Caterer.com director Neil Pattison. ""However, the impact of the pandemic, combined with Brexit has the potential to create a significant recruitment challenge for the sector and we are likely to see the skills shortage it once faced starting to return."" Colum Maher left hospitality and now works in customer services One person who turned his back on a full-time job in hospitality after work dried up due to Covid, is 42-year-old father-of-one Colum Maher. He has 20 years of experience working in bars and restaurants, but last December he took up a full-time job in customer services with Sky. He now says something very special would have to come along for him to go back into hospitality full-time. ""I've had 15 to 20 jobs in the hospitality sector over the years, from bartender to bar manager to chef, so it's an industry I love and know inside out. ""However, I found myself with no work during the pandemic and I needed to find some job security. Now I'm able to work every week, Monday to Friday, so I have no plans to change that now."" But he hasn't turned his back on the industry completely - he's registered with a speciality hospitality recruitment website Coople, to look for weekend work. ""I personally think it's going to take the hospitality industry three to four years to get back on its feet,"" he says. ""I'm at a stage of life when I cannot afford to wait for opportunities to start appearing again - I don't think a lot of pubs will even reopen. ""However, if this doesn't work out, then I know I have something I can hopefully fall back on."" Before Brexit a lot of the UK's hospitality workforce was made up of workers from overseas, including from the EU, buthundreds of thousands of foreign workers have left the UKover the last year and it is unclear whether they will return. Luke Garmsworthy says his restaurants will struggle to open up properly in May if he can't recruit more staff Luke Garnsworthy, who owns Crockers Henley, a hotel and fine dining restaurant in Oxfordshire, and Crockers Tring in Hertfordshire, said he is struggling to recruit enough staff for when his restaurants open fully next month. As well as chefs, he is hoping to hire front-of-house staff and waiters. ""I've put adverts out and I thought I was putting the net out into a sea full of fish but it's not been like that at all."" Mr Garnsworthy would like to employ between 45 and 50 staff at his Henley venue where the headcount is currently only at 12. He said senior team members will step in to fill roles where necessary, but the restaurant was only likely to be able to open five days a week instead of seven. Recruitment in hospitality has always been a challenge, even before the pandemic, but is ""definitely worse now"", according to Mr Garnsworthy. ""We are perceived as unskilled, so the country looks down their noseâ¦ and young people are not interested."" He wants them to know that although it is hard work ""the days of Gordon Ramsey shouting"" are over at least. Restaurant owner and Masterchef The Professionals finalist Sven-Hanson Britt also operates several venues. He said staff turnover in hospitality is normally high, but he too said furloughed staff are sticking with their existing employer. ""There's not that ebb and flow with talent because people are staying put. ""It's very difficult at the moment and finding anyone for senior positions is hard."" Mr Britt is hoping to recruit pastry chefs, chocolatiers and a sommelier. ""We can't seem to find anyone in that arena,"" he added. The business took on a number of staff in October but application rates this time around are far lower. ""Some businesses closed or went bust and people felt let down by their employer or the industry as a whole,"" he said. ""I know a lot of people who have moved on to something different.""

"More than 127,000 people have died with Covid-19 About 22 million people in the UK are living in areas that have not reported any Covid-19 deaths that happened in April, according to BBC News analysis. By comparison, in a four-week period during January's peak, fewer than 50,000 people lived in such places. The findings were greeted as ""really good news [which] give us confidence"" by one expert. The government has urged people to keep following restrictions and have the Covid vaccine when called. The BBC's data analysis reveals the extent of the improvement since January's peak. Fewer than 600 deaths within 28 days of a positive test have been reported so far this month, compared with more than 30,000 in the first four weeks of January. How many coronavirus cases are there in your area? How many people have been vaccinated so far? The figures suggest the UK's pandemic is moving into a new phase, with many areas seeing low levels of coronavirus. The latest lockdown and the vaccination programme have successfully reduced cases, and as a result, deaths. ""This is really good news,"" said Dr Mike Tildesley, an expert in the spread of infectious diseases. ""It's a really good sign and we've seen several parts of the country where prevalence is really, really low. So, I think it gives us confidence."" But he echoed another expert who urged caution. ""[W]e have seen before, when things go wrong they can go wrong quickly,"" said Prof Graham Medley, of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. Slowly lifting restrictions means this is less likely to happen, he added. Areas that did not report any April deaths tended to have fewer confirmed coronavirus cases in March, the data suggests. On average, those places had 150 cases per 100,000 people in March. By comparison, districts that have reported deaths in April had just under 240 positive cases per 100,000 people in March. Some parts have gone even longer without seeing Covid deaths. Plymouth, a major city and home to more than a quarter-of-a-million people, has not reported a Covid death in the last 58 days. In Oxford and Maidstone it's 60 days. But the 19 worst-hit councils accounted for more than a third of the deaths occurring in April. The areas with the highest death rates include two in Northern Ireland: Mid and East Antrim, and Antrim and Newtownabbey, as well as Sedgemoor in Somerset and Bradford, West Yorkshire. Scientists advising the government believe that the focus in the coming months will turn to identifying and containing local and regional outbreaks. How much longer until I can meet friends inside? How old do I have to be to get my vaccine? Postcode check: How are the rules changing for you? There are some differences in the figures from 1-28 April across the UK. Some 56% of local authorities in Scotland reported no deaths - only Glasgow reported more than nine In England, 44% of local authorities in 138 areas across all regions did not report deaths, suggesting the situation is improving nationwide In Northern Ireland, 9% of authorities reported no deaths, and a further 55% reported only one Every local health board in Wales, which represent many more people than councils, reported at least two deaths, but only Betsi Cadwaladr reported more than seven A modern browser with JavaScript and a stable internet connection are required to view this interactive. Enter a full UK postcode or council name to find out  These figures are based on deaths that occurred within 28 days of a positive test. There is usually a delay in reporting deaths, so the official numbers for April will increase, but by this point in March, more than 90% of the month's deaths had been reported. The Office for National Statistics records deaths in a different way, and under this definition more areas may have seen fatalities. Despite the surge in areas with zero deaths, a government spokesperson encouraged people ""to follow the rules so that our roadmap out of lockdown is irreversible"". ""We urge everyone to keep coming forward to get their vaccine when called. This is the best way to keep each other safe and see our roadmap through in full."" In other developments: Aboutone in 1,010 people in households in Englandhad coronavirus in the week to 24 April - down from one in 610 the week before, according to estimates from the latest infection survey by the Office for National Statistics People aged 40 and over in Englandare now able to book their Covid jabs, the NHS has said. Since the vaccine rollout began in December, about 34 million people in the UK have had at least one dose, with more than 14 million people having now had two jabs Shops, gyms, pubs, restaurants and cafes in Northern Irelandwill reopen on Friday after a four-month winter lockdown Liverpool is hosting a government-organisedlive music event as part of a Covid safety pilot on Friday, ahead of a full lifting of restrictions later in the year.

"This video can not be played Second homes making areas ""uninhabitable"" for locals In many parts of Wales, there are few issues more divisive than second homes and their affect on communities. There were 24,873 registered for council tax purposes in January 2021. Many are near the coast and Gwynedd has the highest number with 5,098. Pembrokeshire has 4,068, Cardiff 3,477, Anglesey 2,139 and there are 2,104 in Swansea. Ahead of the Senedd elections, we asked what people would change - and a number were concerned about second homes. In some holiday areas, it is claimed their popularity is pricing local people out of the housing market, and reducing the opportunity for them to rent locally. WALES ALERTS:Get extra updates on BBC election coverage With fewer local people living in some areas, and possibly fewer families, it can affect schools and services, and in some areas, the Welsh language. Since 2017, councils in Wales have had the right to charge a council tax premium of up to 100% on second homes, andsome have already implemented increases. But some say it is unfair and wrong to target people for owning a second home, claiming people have the right to buy where they want. Whoever forms the next government, this is an issue that will remain - and could even escalate. Anwen Thomas is leading a campaign for villagers to buy a chapel Anwen Thomas lives in Pistyll on the Llyn Peninsula, Gwynedd, and is campaigning to raise money to buy a former chapel before it goes to auction. She says Bethania Chapel is due to be auctioned soon, with planning permission to turn it into a holiday home. Communities left 'defenceless' by market forces 'Chaos' over changes for second homes A fundraising page has raised more than Â£27,000 of its Â£120,000 goal. She said the chapel was ""important for our cultural heritage"" and it was ""heartbreaking to think our former chapel will just be used a couple of days a year"". If successful in the bid to buy the building, she said she hoped the chapel would be returned to community use in some form. Gwynedd has the highest number of second homes in Wales Ms Thomas said there was a ""high percentage of second homes in the area"", which was pricing local people out of the market, as well as reducing the number of properties to rent. She added: ""It's very very important to remember that it's not the buyers' or sellers' fault regarding this, it is the system's fault for not putting something in place to safeguard communities and future generations from the decline, erosion and deterioration of the rural communities. ""If nothing is done, this place will be uninhabitable. The local people won't be able to live here. The schools will close. It will just be a seasonal resort. ""I find what happens is people fall in love with our communities and they fall in love with the area, and of course without them realising they then contribute to the community getting lost... eventually when the community is just turned into lots of second homes, they themselves then do not wish to be there and they move on to another rural area, and the process repeats itself."" A number of ways of solving the issue in parts of Wales have been proposed Dr Simon Brooks is a Plaid Cymru town councillor in Borth y Gest - an area where it is estimated a third or more of the housing stock is used as second homes. An associate professor at Swansea University, he recently wrote a report for the Welsh government on how to deal with the issue. He made several recommendations, but believes there are two main ways of tackling the issue. ""Wales is a beautiful place and we have communities along the coast which are very desirable, and people like to relax. So, we have a second homes market. ""Having a small second homes market is not an issue, but if you get to a level in which local people are unable to access housing themselves, then that becomes a problem. ""And I think there's also a recognition that following Covid, with people moving out of cities, and Brexit too, because it's very difficult to buy a second home now on the continent, that this issue will probably increase in the future."" In the village of Abersoch, Gwynedd, a beach hut can cost as much as an affordable home He believes there are two main ways to tackle the issue: ""Firstly, we can look at taxation policy - how can we use the tax system to make buying a second home perhaps less desirable, and fairer for local people? ""And the second issue is we can look at the planning system. ""Should we use the planning system in a particular way that means that parts of the housing stock are not really accessible for the second home market? And that of course would keep a local population in these villages where this is an issue."" However, he admitted there was ""no silver bullet"" and policies could be tailored to individual areas. Barbara Griffiths believes holiday lets bring benefits for the whole community While second homes are considered to be those properties that people visit for their own personal use, holiday lets also affect the availability of housing stock. But can houses run as holiday lets also bring advantages? Barbara Griffiths, who runs North Wales Holiday Cottages, said: ""There is no easy answer. It is a big problem. Everyone wants to live in such a beautiful area, or else be able to come here on holiday. ""Many of our owners are actually local and they then bring revenue into the area by letting out the property that they have, whether because they've bought something as a secondary income business or whether they've maybe been left something by a parent. ""It is something that we've found over the years - that's often the way."" Ms Griffiths said the ""big difference"" is second homes may only be used for a few weeks a year, holiday lets try to ""maximise occupancy and therefore maximise revenue that's coming into the area"". ""And I think then, everyone in the area benefits.""

"This video can not be played 'Getting out and mixing that with a pint - you canât beat it' Thousands of people have gone shopping or enjoyed drinks at pubs as the Covid-19 lockdown eased in Northern Ireland. There were big queues outside some shops, bars and cafes on Friday with many outlets reopening after the four-month winter shutdown. Gyms and swimming pools were also allowed to open again. Some retailers reported busy trade, with one County Down shopping centre manager saying: ""It feels a bit like Christmas Day... there's a good vibe."" Stormont ministers agreed this monththat restrictions could be eased on Friday due to falling numbers of coronavirus cases. Hospitality businesses must only operate outdoors, with table service and limited numbers at each table. Earlier closing times for takeaway businesses and off-licences, imposed at the onset of the lockdown in December, have been removed. Caravans and self-contained tourist accommodation can also reopen. There were big queues outside shops in Londonderry from early on Friday morning Restrictions on meeting up outside have also been slightly eased, with 15 people from three households allowed to meet in a private garden. Long queues formed outside some shops on Friday, sparking some concerns about social distancing and people's adherence to Covid-19 regulations. In Londonderry a line of people had gathered outside the Primark shop from 06:30 BST. What you need to know about NI's lockdown easing Dr Gerry Waldron from the Public Health Agency (PHA) said the ""virus is still out there and is still infecting people"". ""We just want to put a reminder out to people - things are easing off, things are getting better but please keep to all the basic messages,"" he said. His advice for shoppers was to remember social distancing and wear face coverings to help keep themselves and each other safe. The UK's Office for National Statistics estimates that in the week to last Friday1 in 940 people in Northern Ireland had coronavirus, compared with 1 in 660 the previous week. Roger Pollen of the trade body the Federation of Small Businesses said the reopening of much of the economy on Friday was ""a baby-step forward but for many it seems like a huge step"". Buskers and shoppers took to the streets of towns and cities again ""I think we're going to see a bit of a sugar rush in spending now as people get out and getting a chance to do it,"" he said. ""The safety aspect has been well observed - you look round and everyone is wearing their face mask, there's no controversy around that."" Sara Neill, BBC News NI It's a Friday night in the Cathedral Quarter in Belfast but not as we knew it. The few bars and restaurants that have been able to open are operating at a much reduced capacity. And there are queues. There are definitely queues. On our walk through the area our cameraman and I stopped to talk to those who had managed to secure a table. They were in great spirits - delighted to be back in Belfast with a pint and friends, something they felt they had missed and deserved after what has felt like a long year. The queues didn't move much while we were there but there was an air of excitement back in the city on this chilly Friday evening. In pictures: Northern Ireland begins to reopen Chris Nelmes, the manager of the Boulevard shopping centre in Banbridge, County Down, said there had been an ""encouraging start"" to business. ""There's been queues since well before the shops have opened,"" he said. """"It feels a bit like Christmas Day today and with it being a bank holiday weekend it will be very, very busy."" For retail staff there was an ""excitement, a buzz to get back into store, back into what we do best"", said shop manager Laura Mawhinney. ""It definitely feels busier than our previous reopening last June,"" she said. Outdoor hospitality venues were popular across Northern Ireland ""This year customers have a level of expectation - they're a lot more confident, they know what the rules are this time, they know what to expect in their shopping. ""The mood just seems great, I think everyone's just excited."" There was almost a party atmosphere in the centre of Belfast on Friday. The sun was shining, the buskers were back and people were keen to shop. Primark, which famously doesn't sell online, was particularly busy and its queues were well marshalled. ""People are glad to get out - it's been a long four months,"" one of those Primark shoppers told me. In Portrush, County Antrim, Camilla Long from the Causeway Chamber of Commerce described an ""amazing sense of optimism"" in the town. ""I was walking around here last night and there were trucks delivering, windows being washed, doors open for the first time in 18 weeks,"" she said. Some retailers reported brisk trade as a result of pent-up demand ""People [were] getting ready to do what we do best in the north coast and that's to welcome visitors back."" But she also said it was important to acknowledge people whose businesses had collapsed due to the coronavirus pandemic. ""For each and every business owner and family who relies on that business, that is a tragedy."" Adrian Walker of GLL, which runs Belfast City Council's gyms and leisure centres, said that he expected May to be a busy month. ""People are really keen to get back and get back into some form of exercise,"" he said. The ""trickle-flow programme"" the leisure centres had implemented meant there was reduced capacity at gyms, he said, but that allowed people more time to use different machines. Treadmills were rolling and iron was pumped as gyms reopened on Friday Health Minister Robin Swann has warned the hospitality industrynot to seek or promote cross-border businesswhile there is a big difference between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland in the proportion of people who have received a Covid-19 vaccine. On Thursday the Irish government announced a phased relaxation of its highest level of Covid-19 lockdown rules over the coming weeks and months. From 10 May, people can travel outside their county and close contact services and click-and-collect retail can resume. The Stormont executive's advice remains that people in Northern Ireland should ""stay local"". What are NI's Covid travel rules? Ministers have given an indicative date of 24 May for hospitality businesses in Northern Ireland to be allowed to resume trading indoors but that will have to be assessed on 13 May, the next review of the coronavirus restrictions. The executive has also earmarked 24 May for the reopening of tourist accommodation such as hotels and bed-and-breakfasts. There had been some confusion about the implementation of Covid-19 regulations for outdoor hospitality venues in the run-up to Friday. Some venues have been told they could not reopenbecause their outdoor seating areas did not adhere to regulations from the executive. Visitors to Belfast Zoo were given a warm welcome as it opened its gates again On Thursday the industry body Hospitality Ulster saidthe majority of hospitality businesses had failed last-minute inspections. The Department of Health had said the general rule of thumb was that outdoor premises should not be more than 50% enclosed. Delight as life returns to streets of Derry The legislation states that a premises is substantially enclosed if it has a ceiling or roof but there is ""an opening in the walls"". Responsibility for enforcing the regulations on outdoor areas rests with the 11 councils in Northern Ireland. Sean McLaughlin, who owns a fish and chip restaurant in Portrush, was frustrated that the outdoor area he had invested in was deemed unsuitable on Thursday. Council officials have inspected outdoor hospitality areas for compliance with Covid-19 rules He was told that its because its partial coverage did not comply with the rules. ""There's more than adequate ventilation to sit there as one family but you can go to big stores today and brush hands with people and there's nothing,"" he said. ""We've put this in and we're left stuck with it. ""Restaurateurs who are using the exact same space that they used last year are now being told they can't use it - it's nonsensical."" Many bars that are only licensed to sell alcohol indoors but had thought that if they provided a safe outdoor area they would be permitted to open. Bridie Gormley says the reopening of her pub has had to be put back This week three bars in Belleek, County Fermanagh, which had planned to reopen were contacted by the police who said they would not be allowed to trade. Bridie Gormley, the owner of Black Cat Cove, said it was another blow for a ""small rural town that has suffered terribly during Covid"". ""On Monday we found out that our outdoor area is not licensed for outdoor serving,"" she said. ""We had spent thousands of pounds on outdoor furniture, we bought in our stock and we had given our staff a starting date. ""Now all of that has had to be cancelled.""

BBC MonitoringThe world through its media Russia's veterinary and phytosanitary watchdog says it is offering
free Covid-19 tests for pets whose owners
have had coronavirus. The watchdog, Rosselkhoznadzor,
says it isproviding the
tests,externalin 15 cities across Russia, including Moscow, as part of its
efforts to collect information on the prevalence of Covid-19 among animals. It says that the data will
allow scientists to study the likelihood of animal-to-animal transmission
as well as animal-to-human transmission. Last month, Rosselkhoznadzor announced it had
registered ""the world's first"" Covid-19 vaccine
for animals, called Carnivac-Cov. The watchdog's deputy
head Konstantin Savenkov
said at the time that the jab
had undergoneclinical
trials,externalon dogs, cats, mink and other animals - all
of which he said had developed antibodies to the virus. The first batch of 10,000
doses of Carnivac-Cov is to go on sale in early May, the state RIA Novosti news
agency has reported. According to the World Organisation
for Animal Health (OIE), several animal species havedemonstrated
susceptibility,externalto Covid-19, including following transmission
from infected humans. It identified farmed mink as
being particularly susceptible to the virus and says there have been some cases
of the animals transmitting the virus back to humans. Seven people have been arrested in India for allegedly selling fake remdesivir injections, Delhi police said. Remdesivir is an antiviral drug - originally developed to treat Ebola - that showed promising early results. However, in October 2020, the World Health Organization advised against its use for Covid, saying that it ""appeared to have little or no effect on hospitalised Covid"". Police got a tip-off and two of the group were arrested. During interrogation, they admitted that they were selling the fake injections on a higher price as its demand was shooting up due to the Covid crisis. Further raids were then made. A total of 198 vials of fake remdesivir, one packing machine and 3,000 empty vials to be used in packing of remdesivir were recovered, police said. A second wave of the virus is ravaging parts of India, with 386,452 new cases reported on Friday - the biggest one-day increase on record for any country. There were another 3,500 deaths nationwide and nearly 400 in Delhi - a record for the capital. India has registered more than 18 million Covid-19 cases and at least 200,000 deaths, amid an unfolding humanitarian disaster.

This video can not be played African students caught-up in India's Covid-19 crisis share their views The judge was given evidence that the woman would need to be restrained or sedated to be vaccinated An 85-year-old woman with dementia who has a long-standing opposition to vaccines should not be given the Covid jab, a judge has ruled. Mr Justice Hayden in the Court of Protection - where judges consider issues relating to people who lack the mental capacity to make decisions - was asked to make the ruling by the woman's appointed lawyer. The court heard much of her cognitive function had gone. She had never married and had no children. The woman, who cannot be identified but who is a former secretary at a factory in London, had been a long-term opponent of vaccines and would need to be restrained before being given an injection, the court was told. The judge said any attempt to restrain her and give her the vaccine would create ""a traumatic and disturbing scenario"" for her, for staff and other residents. âAlthough much of her cognitive function may have gone, her autonomy, and her own sense of it, continues,"" Mr Justice Hayden said, adding that it ""must be respected"". Surge testing is to be deployed in Redbridge after the identification of two cases of the Covid variant first found in South Africa. NHS Test and Trace will work with the local council to offer additional testing and genomic sequencing in the IG1 and IG6 postcode areas, as well as small parts of IG5 and IG7. Everybody aged 11 and over who lives or works in these postcodes is strongly encouraged to take a PCR test, whether they are showing symptoms or not. The confirmed cases, which are not being linked, are self-isolating and their contacts have been identified, the Department of Health says. Read more about surge testinghere.

The girl's legal case argues the face mask policy could cause ""serious harm"" A 12-year-old girl is suing her school in Sheffield to stop it ""requiring or encouraging"" the use of face masks. Her lawyers claim the masks policy ârisks causing children serious harmâ in terms of their mental and physical health. But the Tapton Academy School Trust, which runs the school, says it only encourages mask-wearing in line with government policy and only one pupil out of 1,000 has complained. The girl, known only as AB, has been exempted from wearing a mask but maintains the policy on masks could cause ""long-term"" harm. Representing AB, Francis Hoar said the school had failed to gather evidence on the effectiveness of masks and said there was ""no evidence, effectively"" that masks work in preventing transmission of the virus. Although AB is exempt, she is still ""faced with a school environment"" in which mask-wearing is enforced ""aggressively"", Mr Hoar said. He said the risk of the virus spreading was ""lower"" in schools. The trust denied enforcing the wearing of masks and added that one in 10 of its staff have caught Covid-19 since August 2020. It said that if it was prevented from encouraging children to wear masks, it could face further legal action from pupils who supported the policy. Annabel RackhamBBC Newsbeat reporter A queue has formed outside Bramley Moore Dock ahead of the event Our reporter Annabel Rackham is at Bramley Moore Dock where 3,000 people are taking part in a trial event to test if the return of clubbing will cause an increase in transmission of Covid-19.

Itâs the calm before the storm right now, because in the next hour 3,000 people are going to be coming through these doors. Itâs like a normal festival set up â youâve got your food tents, medical team, security staff. Except itâs not normal, because itâs the first official clubbing event in the UK in more than a year.

Complaints suggested people were not receiving refunds they were owed within 14 days, as required by law, for package holidays that were cancelled. The Competition and Markets Authority said the delay was ""unacceptable"". Teletext Holidays says it has ""provided evidence of why the refund process has been delayed"" as well as ""real time plans on how and when we can refund all customers"".

Paul Hunter, professor in medicine from the University of East Anglia, says: ""What makes this week's results particularly important is that this would be the first week when there would be any evidence that the relaxation of 12 April would have had a negative impact on the epidemic. ""That there is in fact no evidence of an increased transmission risk is reassuring that, for the time being at least, it looks like the current road map is still on target."" The ONS estimated just 1-in-1010 people in England would have tested positive for Covid in the week up to 24 April.

So here is a reminder of the rules for domestic travel. If you live in England, Scotland or Wales you are free to travel around and between each country. Currently, you should not travel in or out of Northern Ireland unless it is essential to do so. These regulations will be reviewed on 13 May. In England and Wales, self-contained accommodation is open but only to be used by a single household bubble. Welsh hotels, B&Bs and hostels can open if they have en-suites and provide room service. In Scotland, tourist accommodation can open but different households must not share self-contained accommodation. You can find more informationhere. Thirteen infections are linked to the Tan Tock Seng Hospital Singapore is experiencing a rare coronavirus outbreak which has resulted in a hospital locking down four wards. There had been almost no local transmission in Singapore for months, but 16 infections were reported on Thursday and another nine today. Thirteen are linked to Tan Tock Seng Hospital, one of the city-state's biggest, where a Filipino nurse who had been fully vaccinated developed symptoms earlier this week. Four of the wards have now been locked down. The emergence of new virus clusters is a ""worrying trend"", Health Minister Gan Kim Yong told reporters at a virtual press conference. ""There is clearly a heightened risk of infection now in the community,"" he added. The city of 5.7 million has reported about 61,000 cases so far and 30 deaths. Sweden has announced it
will take three weeks longer than expected to offer all adults
their first Covid-19 jab after it decided not to use the
Johnson & Johnson vaccine. This means there are not enough vaccine supplies to meet the mid-August
target. The government is now aiming for 5 September, Health Minister
Lena Hallengren said. The country's health authority has said under-65s should
not get the Johnson & Johnson vaccine due to reports of
extremely rare blood clots. Sweden has not requested deliveries of Johnson & Johnson vaccines from the EU, the country's vaccine
coordinator said. Sweden tried to avoid imposing rules when other countries were in lockdown, but it recently passed emergency laws giving the government the power to impose coronavirus-related curbs for the first time. The country has recorded more than 14,000 deaths - far more than its Scandinavian neighbours. A Japanese luxury cruise is returning to port after a passenger tested positive for Covid-19.

"Amazon continued to cash in on our new shop-work-relax-from-home habits in the first three months of this year, reporting a huge rise in sales and a tripling of profits. Almost every aspect of the Covid-19 pandemic has served to boost the tech giant's revenues, from video streaming to grocery delivery. It said it expects the boom to continue over the next few months. The pandemic could herald ""a golden age"" for Amazon, one analyst said. Amazon's are the latest blow-out results from Big Tech this week. Apple, Facebook, Microsoft and Google's parent firm Alphabet have all reported big sales increases a year after the start of the Covid-19 pandemic. The Amazon group has continued to spread its reach into automated grocery stores, online healthcare services, even experimenting with a bricks-and-mortar hair and beauty salon in London. But its core offerings: online shopping with home delivery, media streaming and cloud-based web-services all flourished during a year of upheaval for other businesses. Revenue rose from $75bn (Â£54bn) this time last year to $108.5bn for the three months to the end of March. Profit was $8.1bn, up from $2.5bn a year ago. Chief executive Jeff Bezos highlighted the streaming service Prime Video and AWS, the web-services division, and said he was ""proud to have them in the family"". ""As Prime Video turns 10, over 175 million Prime members have streamed shows and movies in the past year, and streaming hours are up more than 70% year over year,"" he said. He said AWS had grown in its first 15 years to deliver $54bn annual sales ""competing against the world's largest technology companies."" Mr Bezos is stepping down as chief executive this summer, though he will remain in the less hands-on role of executive chairman. He will be succeeded by AWS's chief executive Andy Jassy. Jeff Bezos will step back from the chief executive role later this year Nicholas Hyett, Equity Analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown said Amazon's results were ""stellar"" particularly given the extra costs associated with doing business during the pandemic. ""Amazon's modus operandi has always been to pour internally generated cash into new investment opportunities wherever possible - but at present it seems to be struggling to find homes for its embarrassment of riches,"" he said. ""This could be a golden age for the group. With high streets shut, Amazon is a natural home for consumers' spare cash, AWS services remote working, which has suddenly become the norm, and tech wizardry is all the more useful when we can't see friends and family in person."" Meet the new face of Amazon - Andy Jassy Judge declines to dismiss Amazon's Trump allegation Amazon's Jeff Bezos backs tax rise on companies Amazon said although the pandemic was receding in some markets it expected its sales and profits to continue to grow, and it still expected  a further $1.5bn costs related to Covid-19. The firm has announced it plans to raise pay for its half a million US employees at a cost of more than $1bn. The firm has faced long-running criticism over pay and working conditions, including claims that workers are under so much pressure they can't take toilet breaks and that it was failing to keep warehouse staff safe from coronavirus infection. Amazon also announced a raft of measures to support employee health. It has already rolled out vaccinations to 300,000 employees and contractors in the US and ""will soon expand to frontline employees in other countries"". The group will continue to extend its range of shopping services and platforms, including Amazon Scout, a fully electric autonomous delivery system that ""rolls down the sidewalk at walking pace and delivers items right to customers"". Scout is already operating in four US states. Other recent innovations include Amazon Pharmacy, which allows Amazon Prime members to save money on prescriptions, Prime Wardrobe which offers personal shopping services and Discover Rooms, which the company described as ""an immersive shopping experience that helps customers browse and shop from thousands of home room designs"".

for animals, called Carnivac-Cov. The watchdog's deputy
head Konstantin Savenkov
said at the time that the jab
had undergoneclinical
trials,externalon dogs, cats, mink and other animals - all
of which he said had developed antibodies to the virus. The first batch of 10,000
doses of Carnivac-Cov is to go on sale in early May, the state RIA Novosti news
agency has reported. According to the World Organisation
for Animal Health (OIE), several animal species havedemonstrated
susceptibility,externalto Covid-19, including following transmission
from infected humans. It identified farmed mink as
being particularly susceptible to the virus and says there have been some cases
of the animals transmitting the virus back to humans. Seven people have been arrested in India for allegedly selling fake remdesivir injections, Delhi police said. Remdesivir is an antiviral drug - originally developed to treat Ebola - that showed promising early results. However, in October 2020, the World Health Organization advised against its use for Covid, saying that it ""appeared to have little or no effect on hospitalised Covid"". Police got a tip-off and two of the group were arrested. During interrogation, they admitted that they were selling the fake injections on a higher price as its demand was shooting up due to the Covid crisis. Further raids were then made. A total of 198 vials of fake remdesivir, one packing machine and 3,000 empty vials to be used in packing of remdesivir were recovered, police said. A second wave of the virus is ravaging parts of India, with 386,452 new cases reported on Friday - the biggest one-day increase on record for any country. There were another 3,500 deaths nationwide and nearly 400 in Delhi - a record for the capital. India has registered more than 18 million Covid-19 cases and at least 200,000 deaths, amid an unfolding humanitarian disaster.

Mr Justice Hayden in the Court of Protection - where judges consider issues relating to people who lack the mental capacity to make decisions - was asked to make the ruling by the woman's appointed lawyer. The court heard much of her cognitive function had gone. She had never married and had no children. The woman, who cannot be identified but who is a former secretary at a factory in London, had been a long-term opponent of vaccines and would need to be restrained before being given an injection, the court was told. The judge said any attempt to restrain her and give her the vaccine would create ""a traumatic and disturbing scenario"" for her, for staff and other residents. âAlthough much of her cognitive function may have gone, her autonomy, and her own sense of it, continues,"" Mr Justice Hayden said, adding that it ""must be respected"". Surge testing is to be deployed in Redbridge after the identification of two cases of the Covid variant first found in South Africa. NHS Test and Trace will work with the local council to offer additional testing and genomic sequencing in the IG1 and IG6 postcode areas, as well as small parts of IG5 and IG7. Everybody aged 11 and over who lives or works in these postcodes is strongly encouraged to take a PCR test, whether they are showing symptoms or not. The confirmed cases, which are not being linked, are self-isolating and their contacts have been identified, the Department of Health says. Read more about surge testinghere.

The girl's legal case argues the face mask policy could cause ""serious harm"" A 12-year-old girl is suing her school in Sheffield to stop it ""requiring or encouraging"" the use of face masks. Her lawyers claim the masks policy ârisks causing children serious harmâ in terms of their mental and physical health. But the Tapton Academy School Trust, which runs the school, says it only encourages mask-wearing in line with government policy and only one pupil out of 1,000 has complained. The girl, known only as AB, has been exempted from wearing a mask but maintains the policy on masks could cause ""long-term"" harm. Representing AB, Francis Hoar said the school had failed to gather evidence on the effectiveness of masks and said there was ""no evidence, effectively"" that masks work in preventing transmission of the virus. Although AB is exempt, she is still ""faced with a school environment"" in which mask-wearing is enforced ""aggressively"", Mr Hoar said. He said the risk of the virus spreading was ""lower"" in schools. The trust denied enforcing the wearing of masks and added that one in 10 of its staff have caught Covid-19 since August 2020. It said that if it was prevented from encouraging children to wear masks, it could face further legal action from pupils who supported the policy. Annabel RackhamBBC Newsbeat reporter A queue has formed outside Bramley Moore Dock ahead of the event Our reporter Annabel Rackham is at Bramley Moore Dock where 3,000 people are taking part in a trial event to test if the return of clubbing will cause an increase in transmission of Covid-19. A little earlier she sent us this: Iâm at Bramley Moore Dock â thereâs not much here apart from a massive warehouse. Itâs the calm before the storm right now, because in the next hour 3,000 people are going to be coming through these doors. Itâs like a normal festival set up â youâve got your food tents, medical team, security staff. Except itâs not normal, because itâs the first official clubbing event in the UK in more than a year. Thereâs so much excitement around the venue â Yousef who is one of the organisers and DJs is already out on the decks, which are in front of me â heâll be headlining tonight and welcoming guests in the first hour. Thereâs a lot of hope and itâs an amazing place to be right now. Teletext Holidays faces legal action unless it pays back Â£7m to customers whose holidays were cancelled owing to the pandemic, a watchdog has said. Complaints suggested people were not receiving refunds they were owed within 14 days, as required by law, for package holidays that were cancelled. The Competition and Markets Authority said the delay was ""unacceptable"". Teletext Holidays says it has ""provided evidence of why the refund process has been delayed"" as well as ""real time plans on how and when we can refund all customers"". A statement says the company is ""extremely disappointed with today's CMA announcement that seemingly ignores the reality of the challenges we face through no fault of our own"". Read more on this story here England's recording of its lowest coronavirus case numbers since September proves the government's roadmap out of lockdown is working, according to one expert. Paul Hunter, professor in medicine from the University of East Anglia, says: ""What makes this week's results particularly important is that this would be the first week when there would be any evidence that the relaxation of 12 April would have had a negative impact on the epidemic. ""That there is in fact no evidence of an increased transmission risk is reassuring that, for the time being at least, it looks like the current road map is still on target."" The ONS estimated just 1-in-1010 people in England would have tested positive for Covid in the week up to 24 April. However, Rowland Kao, professor of data science at the University of Edinburgh, says that while the ""continued decline is good news and should be celebrated"", the ONS survey does not yet ""provide us with more information about what recent changes in restrictions are doing"".

So here is a reminder of the rules for domestic travel. If you live in England, Scotland or Wales you are free to travel around and between each country. Currently, you should not travel in or out of Northern Ireland unless it is essential to do so. These regulations will be reviewed on 13 May. In England and Wales, self-contained accommodation is open but only to be used by a single household bubble. Welsh hotels, B&Bs and hostels can open if they have en-suites and provide room service. In Scotland, tourist accommodation can open but different households must not share self-contained accommodation. You can find more informationhere. Thirteen infections are linked to the Tan Tock Seng Hospital Singapore is experiencing a rare coronavirus outbreak which has resulted in a hospital locking down four wards. There had been almost no local transmission in Singapore for months, but 16 infections were reported on Thursday and another nine today. Thirteen are linked to Tan Tock Seng Hospital, one of the city-state's biggest, where a Filipino nurse who had been fully vaccinated developed symptoms earlier this week. Four of the wards have now been locked down. The emergence of new virus clusters is a ""worrying trend"", Health Minister Gan Kim Yong told reporters at a virtual press conference. ""There is clearly a heightened risk of infection now in the community,"" he added. The city of 5.7 million has reported about 61,000 cases so far and 30 deaths. Sweden has announced it
will take three weeks longer than expected to offer all adults
their first Covid-19 jab after it decided not to use the
Johnson & Johnson vaccine. This means there are not enough vaccine supplies to meet the mid-August
target. The government is now aiming for 5 September, Health Minister
Lena Hallengren said. The country's health authority has said under-65s should
not get the Johnson & Johnson vaccine due to reports of
extremely rare blood clots. Sweden has not requested deliveries of Johnson & Johnson vaccines from the EU, the country's vaccine
coordinator said. Sweden tried to avoid imposing rules when other countries were in lockdown, but it recently passed emergency laws giving the government the power to impose coronavirus-related curbs for the first time. The country has recorded more than 14,000 deaths - far more than its Scandinavian neighbours. A Japanese luxury cruise is returning to port after a passenger tested positive for Covid-19. The Asuka II is carrying 295 passengers and 425 crew members. It will reach Yokohama tomorrow around noon, an NYK Cruises spokeswoman said. The infected passenger tested negative prior to the cruise, but then tested positive on board on Thursday, she said. They are stable and are isolating in a cabin, NYK said in a statement, adding that only one other person had been in close contact. The ship was due to stop in Aomori and Hokkaido, returning to port on 5 May. In February last year, hundreds of people on board the Diamond Princess cruise ship became infected with Covid-19 while it was held in quarantine off the port of Yokohama.

"More than 127,000 people have died with Covid-19 About 22 million people in the UK are living in areas that have not reported any Covid-19 deaths that happened in April, according to BBC News analysis. By comparison, in a four-week period during January's peak, fewer than 50,000 people lived in such places. The findings were greeted as ""really good news [which] give us confidence"" by one expert. The government has urged people to keep following restrictions and have the Covid vaccine when called. The BBC's data analysis reveals the extent of the improvement since January's peak. Fewer than 600 deaths within 28 days of a positive test have been reported so far this month, compared with more than 30,000 in the first four weeks of January. How many coronavirus cases are there in your area? How many people have been vaccinated so far? The figures suggest the UK's pandemic is moving into a new phase, with many areas seeing low levels of coronavirus. The latest lockdown and the vaccination programme have successfully reduced cases, and as a result, deaths. ""This is really good news,"" said Dr Mike Tildesley, an expert in the spread of infectious diseases. ""It's a really good sign and we've seen several parts of the country where prevalence is really, really low. So, I think it gives us confidence."" But he echoed another expert who urged caution. ""[W]e have seen before, when things go wrong they can go wrong quickly,"" said Prof Graham Medley, of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. Slowly lifting restrictions means this is less likely to happen, he added. Areas that did not report any April deaths tended to have fewer confirmed coronavirus cases in March, the data suggests. On average, those places had 150 cases per 100,000 people in March. By comparison, districts that have reported deaths in April had just under 240 positive cases per 100,000 people in March. Some parts have gone even longer without seeing Covid deaths. Plymouth, a major city and home to more than a quarter-of-a-million people, has not reported a Covid death in the last 58 days. In Oxford and Maidstone it's 60 days. But the 19 worst-hit councils accounted for more than a third of the deaths occurring in April. The areas with the highest death rates include two in Northern Ireland: Mid and East Antrim, and Antrim and Newtownabbey, as well as Sedgemoor in Somerset and Bradford, West Yorkshire. Scientists advising the government believe that the focus in the coming months will turn to identifying and containing local and regional outbreaks. How much longer until I can meet friends inside? How old do I have to be to get my vaccine? Postcode check: How are the rules changing for you? There are some differences in the figures from 1-28 April across the UK. Some 56% of local authorities in Scotland reported no deaths - only Glasgow reported more than nine In England, 44% of local authorities in 138 areas across all regions did not report deaths, suggesting the situation is improving nationwide In Northern Ireland, 9% of authorities reported no deaths, and a further 55% reported only one Every local health board in Wales, which represent many more people than councils, reported at least two deaths, but only Betsi Cadwaladr reported more than seven A modern browser with JavaScript and a stable internet connection are required to view this interactive. Enter a full UK postcode or council name to find out  These figures are based on deaths that occurred within 28 days of a positive test. There is usually a delay in reporting deaths, so the official numbers for April will increase, but by this point in March, more than 90% of the month's deaths had been reported. The Office for National Statistics records deaths in a different way, and under this definition more areas may have seen fatalities. Despite the surge in areas with zero deaths, a government spokesperson encouraged people ""to follow the rules so that our roadmap out of lockdown is irreversible"". ""We urge everyone to keep coming forward to get their vaccine when called. This is the best way to keep each other safe and see our roadmap through in full."" In other developments: Aboutone in 1,010 people in households in Englandhad coronavirus in the week to 24 April - down from one in 610 the week before, according to estimates from the latest infection survey by the Office for National Statistics People aged 40 and over in Englandare now able to book their Covid jabs, the NHS has said. Since the vaccine rollout began in December, about 34 million people in the UK have had at least one dose, with more than 14 million people having now had two jabs Shops, gyms, pubs, restaurants and cafes in Northern Irelandwill reopen on Friday after a four-month winter lockdown Liverpool is hosting a government-organisedlive music event as part of a Covid safety pilot on Friday, ahead of a full lifting of restrictions later in the year.

"Amazon continued to cash in on our new shop-work-relax-from-home habits in the first three months of this year, reporting a huge rise in sales and a tripling of profits. Almost every aspect of the Covid-19 pandemic has served to boost the tech giant's revenues, from video streaming to grocery delivery. It said it expects the boom to continue over the next few months. The pandemic could herald ""a golden age"" for Amazon, one analyst said. Amazon's are the latest blow-out results from Big Tech this week. Apple, Facebook, Microsoft and Google's parent firm Alphabet have all reported big sales increases a year after the start of the Covid-19 pandemic. The Amazon group has continued to spread its reach into automated grocery stores, online healthcare services, even experimenting with a bricks-and-mortar hair and beauty salon in London. But its core offerings: online shopping with home delivery, media streaming and cloud-based web-services all flourished during a year of upheaval for other businesses. Revenue rose from $75bn (Â£54bn) this time last year to $108.5bn for the three months to the end of March. Profit was $8.1bn, up from $2.5bn a year ago. Chief executive Jeff Bezos highlighted the streaming service Prime Video and AWS, the web-services division, and said he was ""proud to have them in the family"". ""As Prime Video turns 10, over 175 million Prime members have streamed shows and movies in the past year, and streaming hours are up more than 70% year over year,"" he said. He said AWS had grown in its first 15 years to deliver $54bn annual sales ""competing against the world's largest technology companies."" Mr Bezos is stepping down as chief executive this summer, though he will remain in the less hands-on role of executive chairman. He will be succeeded by AWS's chief executive Andy Jassy. Jeff Bezos will step back from the chief executive role later this year Nicholas Hyett, Equity Analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown said Amazon's results were ""stellar"" particularly given the extra costs associated with doing business during the pandemic. ""Amazon's modus operandi has always been to pour internally generated cash into new investment opportunities wherever possible - but at present it seems to be struggling to find homes for its embarrassment of riches,"" he said. ""This could be a golden age for the group. With high streets shut, Amazon is a natural home for consumers' spare cash, AWS services remote working, which has suddenly become the norm, and tech wizardry is all the more useful when we can't see friends and family in person."" Meet the new face of Amazon - Andy Jassy Judge declines to dismiss Amazon's Trump allegation Amazon's Jeff Bezos backs tax rise on companies Amazon said although the pandemic was receding in some markets it expected its sales and profits to continue to grow, and it still expected  a further $1.5bn costs related to Covid-19. The firm has announced it plans to raise pay for its half a million US employees at a cost of more than $1bn. The firm has faced long-running criticism over pay and working conditions, including claims that workers are under so much pressure they can't take toilet breaks and that it was failing to keep warehouse staff safe from coronavirus infection. Amazon also announced a raft of measures to support employee health. It has already rolled out vaccinations to 300,000 employees and contractors in the US and ""will soon expand to frontline employees in other countries"". The group will continue to extend its range of shopping services and platforms, including Amazon Scout, a fully electric autonomous delivery system that ""rolls down the sidewalk at walking pace and delivers items right to customers"". Scout is already operating in four US states. Other recent innovations include Amazon Pharmacy, which allows Amazon Prime members to save money on prescriptions, Prime Wardrobe which offers personal shopping services and Discover Rooms, which the company described as ""an immersive shopping experience that helps customers browse and shop from thousands of home room designs"".

"This video can not be played 'Getting out and mixing that with a pint - you canât beat it' Thousands of people have gone shopping or enjoyed drinks at pubs as the Covid-19 lockdown eased in Northern Ireland. There were big queues outside some shops, bars and cafes on Friday with many outlets reopening after the four-month winter shutdown. Gyms and swimming pools were also allowed to open again. Some retailers reported busy trade, with one County Down shopping centre manager saying: ""It feels a bit like Christmas Day... there's a good vibe."" Stormont ministers agreed this monththat restrictions could be eased on Friday due to falling numbers of coronavirus cases. Hospitality businesses must only operate outdoors, with table service and limited numbers at each table. Earlier closing times for takeaway businesses and off-licences, imposed at the onset of the lockdown in December, have been removed. Caravans and self-contained tourist accommodation can also reopen. There were big queues outside shops in Londonderry from early on Friday morning Restrictions on meeting up outside have also been slightly eased, with 15 people from three households allowed to meet in a private garden. Long queues formed outside some shops on Friday, sparking some concerns about social distancing and people's adherence to Covid-19 regulations. In Londonderry a line of people had gathered outside the Primark shop from 06:30 BST. What you need to know about NI's lockdown easing Dr Gerry Waldron from the Public Health Agency (PHA) said the ""virus is still out there and is still infecting people"". ""We just want to put a reminder out to people - things are easing off, things are getting better but please keep to all the basic messages,"" he said. His advice for shoppers was to remember social distancing and wear face coverings to help keep themselves and each other safe. The UK's Office for National Statistics estimates that in the week to last Friday1 in 940 people in Northern Ireland had coronavirus, compared with 1 in 660 the previous week. Roger Pollen of the trade body the Federation of Small Businesses said the reopening of much of the economy on Friday was ""a baby-step forward but for many it seems like a huge step"". Buskers and shoppers took to the streets of towns and cities again ""I think we're going to see a bit of a sugar rush in spending now as people get out and getting a chance to do it,"" he said. ""The safety aspect has been well observed - you look round and everyone is wearing their face mask, there's no controversy around that."" Sara Neill, BBC News NI It's a Friday night in the Cathedral Quarter in Belfast but not as we knew it. The few bars and restaurants that have been able to open are operating at a much reduced capacity. And there are queues. There are definitely queues. On our walk through the area our cameraman and I stopped to talk to those who had managed to secure a table. They were in great spirits - delighted to be back in Belfast with a pint and friends, something they felt they had missed and deserved after what has felt like a long year. The queues didn't move much while we were there but there was an air of excitement back in the city on this chilly Friday evening. In pictures: Northern Ireland begins to reopen Chris Nelmes, the manager of the Boulevard shopping centre in Banbridge, County Down, said there had been an ""encouraging start"" to business. ""There's been queues since well before the shops have opened,"" he said. """"It feels a bit like Christmas Day today and with it being a bank holiday weekend it will be very, very busy."" For retail staff there was an ""excitement, a buzz to get back into store, back into what we do best"", said shop manager Laura Mawhinney. ""It definitely feels busier than our previous reopening last June,"" she said. Outdoor hospitality venues were popular across Northern Ireland ""This year customers have a level of expectation - they're a lot more confident, they know what the rules are this time, they know what to expect in their shopping. ""The mood just seems great, I think everyone's just excited."" There was almost a party atmosphere in the centre of Belfast on Friday. The sun was shining, the buskers were back and people were keen to shop. Primark, which famously doesn't sell online, was particularly busy and its queues were well marshalled. ""People are glad to get out - it's been a long four months,"" one of those Primark shoppers told me. In Portrush, County Antrim, Camilla Long from the Causeway Chamber of Commerce described an ""amazing sense of optimism"" in the town. ""I was walking around here last night and there were trucks delivering, windows being washed, doors open for the first time in 18 weeks,"" she said. Some retailers reported brisk trade as a result of pent-up demand ""People [were] getting ready to do what we do best in the north coast and that's to welcome visitors back."" But she also said it was important to acknowledge people whose businesses had collapsed due to the coronavirus pandemic. ""For each and every business owner and family who relies on that business, that is a tragedy."" Adrian Walker of GLL, which runs Belfast City Council's gyms and leisure centres, said that he expected May to be a busy month. ""People are really keen to get back and get back into some form of exercise,"" he said. The ""trickle-flow programme"" the leisure centres had implemented meant there was reduced capacity at gyms, he said, but that allowed people more time to use different machines. Treadmills were rolling and iron was pumped as gyms reopened on Friday Health Minister Robin Swann has warned the hospitality industrynot to seek or promote cross-border businesswhile there is a big difference between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland in the proportion of people who have received a Covid-19 vaccine. On Thursday the Irish government announced a phased relaxation of its highest level of Covid-19 lockdown rules over the coming weeks and months. From 10 May, people can travel outside their county and close contact services and click-and-collect retail can resume. The Stormont executive's advice remains that people in Northern Ireland should ""stay local"". What are NI's Covid travel rules? Ministers have given an indicative date of 24 May for hospitality businesses in Northern Ireland to be allowed to resume trading indoors but that will have to be assessed on 13 May, the next review of the coronavirus restrictions. The executive has also earmarked 24 May for the reopening of tourist accommodation such as hotels and bed-and-breakfasts. There had been some confusion about the implementation of Covid-19 regulations for outdoor hospitality venues in the run-up to Friday. Some venues have been told they could not reopenbecause their outdoor seating areas did not adhere to regulations from the executive. Visitors to Belfast Zoo were given a warm welcome as it opened its gates again On Thursday the industry body Hospitality Ulster saidthe majority of hospitality businesses had failed last-minute inspections. The Department of Health had said the general rule of thumb was that outdoor premises should not be more than 50% enclosed. Delight as life returns to streets of Derry The legislation states that a premises is substantially enclosed if it has a ceiling or roof but there is ""an opening in the walls"". Responsibility for enforcing the regulations on outdoor areas rests with the 11 councils in Northern Ireland. Sean McLaughlin, who owns a fish and chip restaurant in Portrush, was frustrated that the outdoor area he had invested in was deemed unsuitable on Thursday. Council officials have inspected outdoor hospitality areas for compliance with Covid-19 rules He was told that its because its partial coverage did not comply with the rules. ""There's more than adequate ventilation to sit there as one family but you can go to big stores today and brush hands with people and there's nothing,"" he said. ""We've put this in and we're left stuck with it. ""Restaurateurs who are using the exact same space that they used last year are now being told they can't use it - it's nonsensical."" Many bars that are only licensed to sell alcohol indoors but had thought that if they provided a safe outdoor area they would be permitted to open. Bridie Gormley says the reopening of her pub has had to be put back This week three bars in Belleek, County Fermanagh, which had planned to reopen were contacted by the police who said they would not be allowed to trade. Bridie Gormley, the owner of Black Cat Cove, said it was another blow for a ""small rural town that has suffered terribly during Covid"". ""On Monday we found out that our outdoor area is not licensed for outdoor serving,"" she said. ""We had spent thousands of pounds on outdoor furniture, we bought in our stock and we had given our staff a starting date. ""Now all of that has had to be cancelled.""

"This video can not be played 'Politics is a brutal game' - Arlene Foster speaks out after resignation Arlene Foster will quit the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) when she stands down as Northern Ireland's first minister, BBC News NI understands. Sources close to her said she thinks it is no longer the party she joined and it is moving in a different direction. Mrs Foster is to resign as DUP leader on 28 May and end her tenure as first minister at the end of June. On Thursday, Agriculture Minister Edwin Poots declared his intention to stand for the party leadership. By Friday evening five of the party's Northern Ireland Assembly members and one of its MPs had publicly announced their support for his campaign. Mrs Foster announced her resignation after about 80% of the DUP's Stormont and Westminster ranks signed a letter of no confidence in her leadership. Speaking on Friday, she said that none of her colleagues who signed the letter of no confidence had spoken to her since then. She also said that some of her colleagues - including some ""good friends"" - had not signed the letter. Edwin Poots is the first candidate to announce a bid to lead the DUP She said she would wait until she stepped down as first minister before making public her decision about whether she would remain in the DUP. Mrs Foster has led the DUP since December 2015. The following month she was appointed first minister, becoming the first woman and the youngest person to hold both jobs. Sir Jeffrey Donaldson is expected to enter the DUP leadership race this weekend. Edwin Poots has been quick out of the blocks with his bid and has been building support - all of his backers so far were always likely to take his side. What will be key will be the floating voters among the party members entitled to have a say in this contest. It is understood that Sir Jeffrey is confident he will get his fellow DUP MPs to support his campaign. But he has lots of work to do to get the remainder of the Stormont ranks into his corner. In her resignation statement on Wednesday, she said she was preparing to leave the political stage. BBC News NI understands that means not only quitting as a Stormont assembly member but severing her ties with the party she has led since December 2015. On Thursday she informed her constituency association in Fermanagh and South Tyrone of her decision. Questioned on Friday about whether she intended to become a member of the House of Lords, she said that was a matter for other people to determine. Asked about the future of the DUP, she wished her successor and the party well. This video can not be played BBC News NI looks back at Arlene Foster's political career Mrs Foster has endured several major challenges during her time at the helm of the party, including division among members on social issues and significant recent pressure resulting from the fallout from Brexit, which the party supported. The post-Brexit arrangements for Northern Ireland - which have included a trade border being imposed between Great Britain and Northern Ireland - have been deeply unpopular with the party's core voters. From trailblazing leader to party civil war Poots declares bid to succeed Foster as DUP leader Who are the DUP leadership contenders? BBC News NI understands that DUP officers will meet on Tuesday to discuss the timetable and the procedure for electing a party leader. Announcing his desire to succeed Mrs Foster, Mr Poots said he was looking forward to the ""engagement and the debate"" in the leadership contest. He has secured the backing of senior Stormont assembly members, the first of which was Christopher Stalford, who said his friend had the ""experience and talents to take our country and our party forward"".

"Even without a global pandemic, the mayor of London would be facing a demanding term in office. The mayor, who will run a Â£19bn budget, is tasked with keeping the capital running and making the streets safe. What will be the biggest challenges in the next mayor's in-tray? London was at the epicentre of the first wave of the coronavirus pandemic and has borne the brunt of economic fallout worse than any other region. An estimated 1.6 million workers in London were furloughed,externalat some point during the pandemic - the highest rate in the UK. Latest figures showmore than half a million Londoners claim unemployment benefit,external, about 6% of the capital's population. Nationally about 4% of the population are on some form of out of work benefit. London's new mayor will need to use their influence to convince businesses and holidaymakers they are safe and welcome to visit All of the main money-raising and spending decisions are made by central government, but the mayor has powers over ""strategic planning"". This means he or she can give permission to projects considered important to London's development. Mostly, though, the mayor's office acts as a business hub, offering support and advice, and connecting companies with investors. As a figurehead, though, the role is central to inspiring business confidence at home and abroad. The mayor will need to use his or her influence to convince businesses and holidaymakers they're safe and welcome to visit - bringing money and jobs to the city. Transport for London (TfL) has received Â£4bn in emergency funding just to keep running since coronavirus hit. Since then TfL's finances have become a battleground between the mayor and the government. Keeping TfL running and independent will be a key challenge over the next mayoral term. Covid and Crossrail - why TfL's finances are precarious Since the pandemic, TfL's fare revenues have fallen by 90% as passenger numbers plummeted to levels not seen since the 19th Century. This is a big problem, as fares make up the majority of TfL's funding. London is one of the only cities in the world,externalthat does not receive government funding to support the operating costs of its transport network. Immense challenges lie ahead at City Hall after more than a year under the restraints of a pandemic. The new mayor will need to keep a very close eye on public health. They will have to liaise with the NHS, local councils and the emergency services and be prepared to lead communications if, or when, things flare up again. The economic recovery will gradually absorb more time and energy. Soon the furlough plaster will be removed - and scarring revealed. Limited resources. Plenty of levers. The same old mayoral story. Ahead lies a genuine test of leadership. But how do you get the economic heart of the capital working again? In practical terms, one huge milestone is what the new mayor can agree with the government over transport and how to finance it. But there is a battle too about devolution, and whether the government intends to pull in or let out powers to run the capital. On the two other major areas of influence - policing and housing - there will be no let-up in the scrutiny. And to add to the mayoral ""to-do"" list will be getting their own house in order. In the autumn, the machinery of the London government will be shifting from City Hall to a new headquarters in a building called The Crystal at the Royal Victoria Dock in east London. Even before the pandemic, TfL was dealing with financial pressures on several fronts. Much has been made about Sadiq Khan's flagship policy of freezing fares across the London Underground network for the duration of his term as mayor. Althoughcontroversial at the time, the fares freeze has been fully paid for through TfL's efficiencies programme, outlined in its December 2016 Business Plan, according to City Hall. The escalating costs of the delayed Crossrail project are also huge for TfL. Europe's largest infrastructure project is two years overdue andÂ£4bn more expensive than originally planned. TfL's commissioner Andy Byford has been asked to review the latest Crossrail delays This comes at a time when TfL is being denied a source of income from fares, commercial advertising and retail units at stations. Getting the project sorted will be at the top of any mayor's new list. Knife crime increased steadily over the past five years, before dropping drastically during London's lockdowns. In 2019 the number of teenagers stabbed to death in the capitalreached its highest level since 2008. Violent crime - a broader category which includes murders, physical attacks and stalking offences - has been increasing in London since 2014, but has now dropped to about 7% below the level in 2016 according to Met Police figures. Knife crimes across England and Wales are at a record high Crime in London should not be looked at in isolation, though. Knife crime in England and Walesis at a record high.There were 46,265 offences in the 12 months to the end of March 2020, with the figure having risen every year since 2015. The mayor officially acts as the police and crime commissioner for London, which means the mayor has a role in setting out how London is policed and staffed. As London emerges from lockdown, keeping London's streets safe will be a priority for any mayor. This year, for the first time, London's air quality was recorded at an inquest as a factor in a person's death in the capital. Ella Adoo-Kissi-Debrah, who lived near the South Circular Road in Lewisham, died in 2013 following years of asthma attacks and seizures. Southwark Coroner's Court found that air pollution""made a material contribution""to the nine-year-old's death. In an official ""report to prevent future deaths"" the coroner,called for national pollution limitsto be reduced. The capital's poor air quality was linked with about 9,000 premature deaths in 2015. A report by City Hall,externalfound air pollution in London to have fallen over the past five years. The number of people living in areas with illegal levels of nitrogen dioxide fell by 94% between 2016 to 2019, the report found. The number of schools in such areas fell by 97%, over the same period. LONDON'S ELECTION: THE BASICS What's happening:On 6 May, people will vote to elect a mayor and 25 members of the London Assembly. Together they form the Greater London Authority, which governs the capital.You can register to vote online,external. Why does it matter?The mayor has a Â£19bn budget, is responsible for transport and policing and has a role in housing, planning and the environment. The London Assembly holds the mayor to account.Find out more here. Who is standing?There are 20 candidates running for London mayorand a full list can be found here. But 24% of inner London roads still exceeded pollution limits, and figures show thousands of Londoners still breathe air that breaches pollution limits. The successes have come at a price. City Hall says the improved air quality is due to programmes such as the Ultra Low Emissions Zone. The scheme, which charges older and more polluting vehicles to drive into the capital, has been controversial. Many arecalling for it to overhauled or scrapped. Balancing the needs of road users and improving London's air quality could be a defining challenge of the next administration. City Hall estimates London requires about 66,000 new homes a year to provide enough dwellings to be ready for expected population growth. This target has never been achieved in the 21-year history of the mayor of London. In 2018-19, the last financial year with complete figures, about 36,000 new homes were built, according to theLondon Development Database.,externalOf these 6,500 were affordable homes. In the same year, planning applications for 82,000 new homes were approved. Social rented, affordable rented, and intermediate housing are all classed as a form of affordable homes According to City Hall's assessment, about two-thirds of these new homes would need to be affordable homes - a broad category that includes social rented, affordable rented, and intermediate housing. The mayor has few direct powers in relation to housebuilding, though. Instead, the role sets targets on the number and type of homes built and works on these with local authorities and developers. Finding inventive ways to increase the supply of new homes, particularly affordable homes, will be key for any future mayor. Voting:How do the elections work in London?

"This video can not be played Election 2021:  What do young people know about police and crime commissioners? From the Edward Colston statue toppling during a Black Lives Matter demo to violent clashes over the Police and Crime Bill, Bristol has seen major protests in the past two years. These events have put policing, policy and power in the spotlight, especially for young people, whose voices -  as the flag-bearers for all sorts of social justice initiatives - need to be heard, according to University of Bristol professor of politics Simon Tormey. Ahead of theGloucestershire,WiltshireandAvon and Somersetpolice and crime commissioner (PCC) elections on 6 May, the BBC asked young voters in the area what they know about the role. Megan Davis said it was ""unfair some constituents who will be voting don't really know about the PCC elections"" A PCC is not a serving member of a police force but they are voted for, by the public, to hold forces to account. Megan Davis, 24, from Gloucestershire, said it was ""incredibly important people are better informed"" about PCCs. ""It's not something I've heard of and I would like to think that I'm politically aware and active,"" she said. ""People need to be made more aware otherwise they may turn up to the ballot unsure of how to cast their votes, which means they won't be voting for what they believe in and that's unfair on constituents."" Speaking about the policing of the Kill The Bill protests, which she took part in in both Bristol and Cheltenham, she added: ""I agree with people who criticised the policing in Bristol because it was incredibly violent, but then in smaller rural communities like Cheltenham the policing was more of a community presence which was positive, and from that we can see how policing can be different. ""People who attended the more recent protests are incredibly angry at the police and their violence and how they treated women at [the Sarah Everard vigils] needs to be changed, and it seems that change could be made by voting."" Robert Graham said he did not believe the Kill the Bill demos were right Bristol studentRobert Graham, 26, said: ""The protests weren't right and police got hurt so we need a PCC who isn't afraid to defend the police and speak out."" He wants to see a PCC that will offer ""more engagement on local crime issues and who will be seen commenting on police activity more"". ""I think the police did a great service during the protests, stopping people from doing criminal damage but, from the new PCC, I do want someone who will put even more police on the streets to stop crime from happening to make the streets feel safer,"" he added. ""That would also help if any violent protests happen again."" Jemima Brett said she didn't know much about the role of the PCC Jemima Brett, 27, said past experiences with police had made her feel ""distrust"" towards them, and is unsure how she will vote. The care worker from Bristol said: ""I feel negative about police forces in general because of how I have seen them treat people close to me badly in the past. ""I will be voting in the elections but I don't know much about the PCC role. ""It's clearly important, so people should be informed more. ""There should be more posters on the streets and things online about it, not just a letter through the post because people don't always read that stuff."" Mya-Rose Craig said money needs to be spent in communities Bristol environmental activistMya-Rose Craig, 18, said she did not know about the PCC role and was ""surprised"" to learn about it. She said: ""I've always felt like the police is a very separate entity from the people and thought we didn't have a say in anything. Protesters tear down Edward Colston statue Police attacked as 'Kill the Bill' demo turns violent What does a PCC do? ""I will be voting on that now because police funding isn't necessarily going where I would choose for it to go. ""Personally I would prioritise money going into communities rather than any more being spent on riot gear and riot vans, so I will vote based on that."" Owen said he was ""not massively invested in the PCC elections"" Bristol engineer and activistOwen, 20, said he did not think the role will help make the changes he thinks are ""necessary"" to make his local police force better. He said: ""I have a lot of thoughts about the way that policing is done in Bristol and the policing model of the UK in general because I think that police forces consistently get things wrong, and I don't think the PCC role is going to change that. ""So, personally I'm not massively invested in it."" The protests on the streets of Bristol have focused much attention on policing. They have also exposed differences between the candidates who seek to become the next Avon and Somerset Police and Crime Commissioner. And, in a contest where all too often the contenders want similar things (basically ""more police, less crime""), it is refreshing to see some clear blue water opening up. One snag though; a PCC does not decide how a protest is policed. She or he sets the budget for the force and agrees its priorities. But operational matters, such as how officers handle late-night confrontations with demonstrators, are determined by the chief constable. They do though have one other significant responsibility which can influence the way policing is carried out. The PCC appoints the chief constable. That is a fairly rare event, but it will be one of the first challenges awaiting the new PCC, with Avon and Somerset's Andy Marsh retiring in July.

"New laws that could leave flat owners facing bills for fire safety measures are ""indefensible"", say Grenfell Tower survivors and bereaved relatives. The Fire Safety Act is aimed at making homes saferfollowing the 2017 blaze, in which 72 people died. But a push to include more financial protections for leaseholders was defeated in a Parliamentary vote, despite a large Tory rebellion. The government has made a Â£5bn fund available to remove cladding. Home Secretary Priti Patel said the government was paying for remedial work to ""thousands of buildings around the country"". She said the act would ""actually help to save lives by changing some of these awful regulations and guidelines that existed previously"". Government defeated again on fire safety measures What makes cladding unsafe and what are your rights? Grenfell Tower management 'was a mini-mafia' After the Grenfell tragedy, thousands of blocks of flats were found to be covered in similar cladding. Other defects were also discovered, leaving leaseholders facing large bills to pay for protective measures such as fire breaks, balconies, safer doors and sprinkler systems. Ministers say a loan scheme will ensure costs are capped at Â£50 a month for safety works and that residents in the tallest tower blocks in England will not have to pay to have cladding removed. Leaseholders have described being trapped in homes they cannot sell, with their lives on hold potentially for years, because lenders will not offer mortgages until the cladding is removed. Reports of the toll on residents' mental health have been widespread. Campaigners say leaseholders should be protected from all remediation costs that have arisen through no fault of their own. Critics, including some Conservative MPs, had argued the government should meet all the costs upfront and then recoup them from property developers. The Grenfell United group, which was set up after the tragedy in west London, said it was ""deeply disappointed that ministers have broken their promises to leaseholders who have done absolutely nothing wrong"". It described the government's position as ""indefensible"", saying it was a ""grave injustice that many innocent leaseholders will be financially ruined over fire safety issues that were not of their own making"", and it accused ministers of ""letting those responsible continue to get off scot-free"". This video can not be played ""It could be anything from bankruptcy to a life of crippling loans"" Lawyer Steph Pike, a leaseholder of a one-bedroom flat in Bristol, said she could be facing a Â£70,000 bill next year to cover the cost of improvement work to her building. She told the BBC the situation was ""completely unbelievable"" and said some days she asked herself: ""Is this even happening?"" ""I'm a lawyer, so I've got a professional qualification that I need to protect and if I have to declare myself bankrupt I'll lose that, so I'll also lose my career."" Rachael Teebay says she has ""spent days and weeks crying"" about the situation Leaseholder Rachael Teebay bought her first home together with her partner in Manchester, but now she is among thousands facing huge bills. ""I have spent days and weeks crying about it and worrying about our future,"" she told the BBC. ""Declaring bankruptcy at this age, what does that do for our future? It decimates it. It's terrifying."" Stephen Squires, a leaseholder who lives in a tower block in Manchester bearing dangerous cladding, said ministers' reluctance to compromise was ""hugely disappointing and really makes us feel like the government do not grasp the severity of the situation we all find ourselves in through no fault of our own"". He added: ""Our service charge account is running out of money, whilst the freeholder delays things. Eventually we could end up with having the lifts switched off or the electric being cut off to a 20-storey building, which would make it uninhabitable."" The campaigning group End Our Cladding Scandal said the legislation had passed unchanged, ""much to the horror of hundreds of thousands of innocent people across the country whose lives are being ruined by the buildings safety crisis"". It said the government had ""fought hard"" against changes that would have saved leaseholders from ""widespread bankruptcy and financial ruin caused by bad regulations, corporate malfeasance and shoddy building work"". ""This [act] pulls the rug out from under a generation of homeowners"" whose lives were still at risk from unsafe buildings, it added. The group has vowed to continue opposing the reforms, tweeting: ""We have the right to be angry. But the fight isn't over yet."" The new legislation modifies a previous law to clarify that building owners must manage and reduce the risk of fire in their properties. The government was under pressure to get it passed before the end of the parliamentary session on Thursday. It said it struck ""the right balance in protecting leaseholders and being fair to taxpayers"". A Department for Housing, Communities and Local Government spokesperson said ministers were prioritising making the tallest buildings with the most dangerous cladding safer, backed by Â£5bn in funding. ""We have been clear throughout that owners and industry should make buildings safe without passing on costs to leaseholders - and we will ensure they pay for the mistakes of the past with a new levy and tax to contribute to the costs of remediation,"" they added. ""For lower-rise buildings which have a lower risk, our generous capped finance scheme will ensure bills are a maximum of Â£50 per month.""

"This video can not be played Footage shows chaotic scenes in the aftermath of the crush at the religious festival At least 44 people have been killed in a crush at a crowded religious festival in the north-east of Israel. Dozens more were injured at the Lag B'Omer celebration, which takes place annually at the foot of Mount Meron. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu travelled to the scene and said Sunday would be a day of national mourning. Tens of thousands of Orthodox Jews attended the all-night festival, making it the largest event in Israel since the coronavirus pandemic began. The country's successful vaccination programme has allowed it to lift many restrictions, but health officials had still warned of the risk of Covid-19. Witnesses: 'People were thrown up in the air' Early reports suggested a structure at the site had collapsed, but emergency officials later said a crush had occurred at around 01:00 local time (22:00 GMT Thursday). Police sources told Haaretz newspaper that it started after some attendees slipped on steps, which caused dozens more to fall. Witnesses said some people fell down a crowded set of steps ""It happened in a split second; people just fell, trampling each other. It was a disaster,""one witness told the newspaper,external. Videos posted online show thousands of people struggling to flee through a narrow passageway. Loudhailer messages urged the crowds to disperse, before police requested the full evacuation of the site. ""No-one imagined that this could happen here,"" one pilgrim told Channel 12 TV. ""Rejoicing became mourning, a great light became a deep darkness."" Dozens of ambulances attended the scene as emergency services laid out bodies under foil covers on the ground. Helicopters took the injured to hospital, while the military said search-and-rescue troops had also been deployed. At least 150 people were injured, officials said, including38 people who were in critical condition at the site,external. The festival attracted tens of thousands of attendees Children were also caught up in the disaster, and witnesses said paramedics were seen performing CPR on some of them. Earlier in the day, officials said they were not able to enforce coronavirus restrictions owing to the huge crowds. Police reportedly said they had arrested two people for disrupting their efforts to keep order before the crush occurred. Israel is a nation in shock.  This is the worst civilian disaster in its modern history. Questions are being asked about how an annual celebration turned into such a tragedy. Police - who were in charge of public security at the site - are used to even bigger numbers turning up and they are already facing criticism. They have launched their own investigation. At Mount Meron, there are still chaotic scenes and hundreds of buses are trying to transport the attendees away. Meanwhile, many families have struggled to get news of their loved ones due to overburdened phone services. Some bodies are yet to be identified and funerals are not expected to take place until after the Jewish Sabbath, which begins at sunset. Leading rabbis have called for prayers to support the bereaved and injured. Witnesses have described the panic as the crush began to unfold. ""It was crowded and there [was]... no place to move,"" one attendee told the BBC. ""People started to fall on the ground."" ""All of a sudden we saw paramedics... running by,"" another attendee, Shlomo Katz, said. ""One after the other [they] started coming out... Then we understood that something is going on here."" ""Over 1,000 people together tried to go down a very, very small place, very narrow road and they just fell on top of each other,"" said Yanki Farber, a reporter with the Orthodox Jewish website Behadrei Haredim. An emergency worker told AFP news agency that he saw ""dozens of people fall on top of one another"" and ""a large number of them were crushed and lost consciousness"". ""I have not seen anything like this since I entered into the field of emergency medicine,"" Lazar Hyman, a volunteer rescue worker, told AFP. Another first responder, Dov Maisel, told the BBC: ""We just finished treating one of Israel's worst disasters. ""A terrible disaster of people who came to celebrate... and unfortunately were literally crushed to death,"" he said. Benjamin Netanyahu visits the scene in Mount Meron. He called the deaths a ""heavy disaster"" Tens of thousands of Orthodox Jews make a pilgrimage to Meron each year for Lag B'Omer, a religious holiday marked with all-night bonfires, prayer and dancing. The town is the site of the tomb of Rabbi Shimon Bar Yochai, a revered Second-Century sage, who ordained that the anniversary of his death be commemorated with a celebration of his life. The site is mostly gender-segregated. Images and video suggest the crush happened in one of the men's sections. According to the Times of Israel, organisers estimated that 100,000 people arrived on Thursday night. Attendance was higher than last year, when the festival was held under restrictions due to the coronavirus pandemic. But it was still smaller than in previous years, when hundreds of thousands of people took part. Were you in the area? Did you witness what happened?
