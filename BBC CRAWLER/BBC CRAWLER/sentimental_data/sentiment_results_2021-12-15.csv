"English gig venues have been open without social distancing since July Fears about the Omicron variant - and a desire to stay safe before Christmas - have led to a sharp decline in bookings and attendances at many entertainment venues, industry figures have said. The Music Venue Trust said audiences dropped by 23% in the past week, which is ""catastrophic"" for its members. Lower than expected cinema takings last weekend were also blamed on Omicron. Meanwhile, from Wednesday, some English venues require visitors to show a Covid pass, as well as wearing face masks. On Sunday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson warned of a ""tidal wave"" of infections - and anyone who tests positive must self-isolate for 10 full days, which would now include Christmas Day. Nathan Pearce from theatre ticket agency Seatplan said: ""As soon as Omicron was reported as a serious threat we saw a 30% drop in sales almost overnight. ""And when Boris made his announcement we saw another 40% drop. ""Everyone now is facing huge uncertainty and the big worry is if we have to reintroduce social distancing, it would be hugely damaging."" Music Venue Trust chief executive Mark Davyd said some fans are more worried about having their Christmas plans disrupted again than catching the virus itself. ""A lot of people are making understandable decisions last week and this week on that basis,"" he said. But the downturn is costing the 900 grassroots venues that the organisation represents Â£2m a week, a large slice of which is lost bar takings from people who have bought tickets but don't turn up, he said. Covid pass starts in England despite Tory revolt Top theatres cancel shows after Covid outbreaks Where will I need to use a Covid passport? ""It will be interesting to see whether there is a slight bounce back in two weeks' time. But the reality is, this sector cannot lose Â£2m a week. It does not have Â£2m a week to lose. ""We've been through a very long crisis. There aren't the reserves in order to handle the Â£2m loss a week across the sector. We already have Â£90m debt as a result of the crisis. We cannot take on more debt."" The government should make more money available from the Culture Recovery Fund and suspend business rates and cut VAT again, he said. ""We really need the government to act now using all the tools it's had during the Covid crisis. We don't need, this time around, three to six months of debate about what to do. We already know what to do and so do they."" Nick Mills, who runs the 21Soho and 2Northdown comedy clubs in London as well as the TicketText ticketing platform, also said his sales ""have fallen off a cliff"", and around 40% of people who already have tickets are not turning up. ""I completely understand that people need to protect themselves for Christmas and they don't want to be isolating over that period, he said. But he added: ""It's absolutely decimated attendances."" Around 20 shows that were scheduled in his venues before Christmas have been cut to eight as acts or promoters have cancelled them, he said. ""Sadly, we've got no option but to trade through. There's no government support, there's no assistance, no help. So the shows that we do have, we need to throw everything at them."" He added: ""It's squeaky bum time. It's a panic. We thought we had come out of it and we thought everything was on track, and we don't know how many times it can restart. The amount of cost and effort that goes in and the mental exhaustion from it all... ""Salaries are due and rents are due and that won't change. So I've got to look at being creative."" Dawn Harrison has tickets to see Gary Barlow at the O2 in London and to take her family to see Operation Ouch! Live at the Lyric Theatre in the West End this weekend. But they won't be using them. ""It's just too much risk,"" says Mrs Harrison, 44, from Colchester, Essex. ""It's just the crowds, being inside with loads of people. ""If it was a month ago, I don't think I'd necessarily have been that worried. But if we catch anything now, we're within a 10-day isolation period, so that messes up all of Christmas. ""Obviously I don't want get ill or anything, but it wasn't a very good Christmas last year. I want to protect myself and my family as much as possible to see more family this year."" She and a friend were able to get a refund for a hotel for the night of the Gary Barlow show. They are likely to lose the Â£90 cost of the tickets, but are willing to ""cut our losses"", she said. Mrs Harrison and her husband took their daughter, 12, to a similar Operation Ouch! show two years ago. ""She was so excited to go and see it again,"" she said. ""But she understands. We stood in the kitchen the other night having a little family meeting and talked it through. She says, 'Yeah I'm upset but I understand why.'"" In cinemas, Steven Spielberg's West Side Story remake earned Â£1.3m in its first week at UK and Irish box offices - more than Â£1m less than Lady Gaga's House of Gucci opened with two weeks earlier. This weekend's overall takings were the lowest since late September. ""There's nervousness for sure about going to the cinema and the numbers were not particularly strong,"" said Screen International deputy editor Louise Tutt. But box offices are expected to rebound with Wednesday's highly anticipated release of Spider-Man: No Way Home. Cinemas are hoping Spider-Man: No Way Home will bring some Christmas cheer The superhero sequel has enjoyed record pre-sales, although bookings opened before concerns about the spread of Omicron deepened. ""It will be interesting to see how Spider-Man does this weekend,"" Tutt said. ""It's too late to move [the release dates of] that and the Matrix, the big pre-Christmas openers, and the distributors will be hoping they can last well into January when they will be hoping audience confidence returns."" Phil Clapp, chief executive of the UK Cinema Association, said West Side Story's takings were ""disappointing"", adding: ""That undoubtedly does speak to concern amongst certain audience segments around Covid."" Older film fans - who are a large part of West Side Story's target audience - have generally been more reluctant to return to cinemas at all, he said. ""To contrast, what we've seen in terms of pre-sales and an audience response to Spider Man: No Way Home has been extraordinary. The level of pre-sales exceeds even the likes of [James Bond's] No Time To Die."" Many theatres are reporting healthy audiences for pantomimes and other Christmas shows, which are crucial for the venues' finances for the rest of the year. Stephanie Sirr, chief executive of the Nottingham Playhouse and president of UK Theatre, said sales had ""slowed down"", but that her bigger concern is casts and crews staying Covid-free. In recent days,a string of theatres have been forced to cancelperformances or even whole runs because of outbreaks. ""What we're saying to companies is just be super vigilant and really take care of your health. And then to audiences, just follow every single safety measure that you possibly can with a good grace, and this won't go on forever. ""Because this is Christmas and this is when the money comes in. It couldn't be a worse time of year for this to have a resurgence."" She added: ""The problem is, there's no talk of another recovery fund. There's no talk of another safety net for the industry. ""There just will be fewer theatres and fewer producers if the worst happens."" A spokesperson for the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport said: ""We have provided unprecedented support for the cultural, heritage and creative sectors during the pandemic through our unprecedented Â£2bn Culture Recovery Fund. So far more than Â£1.3bn has been allocated to around 5,000 individual organisations and sites. ""Under current plans, the additional Â£300m announced in the Spring Budget is the final allocation of the Culture Recovery Fund and will support organisations through to spring 2022. The fund is currently open for applications, and we will keep the delivery of the programme under active review and consider how best to adapt it in line with the needs of the sector.""

"The government has been urged by its official immigration advisers to make it easier for foreign care workers to come to the UK. The Migration Advisory Committee (MAC) said the sector was facing ""severe and increasing"" problems with hiring and retaining staff after Brexit. It suggested changes to allow employers to sponsor visas for workers on more than Â£20,480 a year. The Home Office said it would consider the recommendation carefully. The proposal was welcomed by several groups in the care sector, who have long argued less stringent rules are needed to boost recruitment. Research charity Skills for Care estimated last month that just over 11% of vacancies in the sector are currently unfilled. What are the challenges facing social care? Help for home changes pledged in social care plan Social care needs 'proper wages' - migration chair The MAC's recommendation came as it published initial findings of a review it is conducting into the effect of Brexit on social care recruitment. Since the UK left the EU, social care workers from EU countries are no longer automatically eligible to work in the UK and instead have to apply for a visa. The committee said all social care workers should be able to apply under the UK's ""shortage occupation list"", meaning they need fewer points and a lower salary to meet the criteria. They also said they should be able to apply for the government's special visa for health and social care workers. Currently, only senior roles with qualifications above a certain level are eligible for these routes. The MAC recommended the move to help ""alleviate"" short-term recruitment problems, which it said were likely to worsen post-Brexit. However, it also concluded many issues predated the UK's exit, and ""underfunding"" of the sector was ""the underlying cause"" of difficulties. The recommendation to widen access to the shortage occupation list was welcomed by industry groups Care England and the Homecare Association. Mike Padgham, chairman of the Independent Care Group, also said a relaxation of immigration rules ""can't come soon enough"". He added that the sector was already ""on its knees"" trying to cope with self-isolation caused by the spread of the Omicron variant of Covid. Migration Minister Kevin Foster said the government's post-Brexit immigration system was ""delivering on the people's priorities of getting businesses to invest in the domestic workforce while attracting those with the skills we need."" He said senior roles were already eligible for the easier visa routes, ""but businesses need to make long-term investments in the UK domestic workforce, including offering hard working care workers the rewarding packages they deserve.""

"More restrictions could be introduced before Christmas in response to the new Omicron variant, Scotland's deputy first minister has said. John Swinney also urged people to take ""the greatest of care"" over household mixing. On Tuesday people were asked to limit socialising to three households at a time in the run-up to the festive period. But Nicola Sturgeon said the advice would not apply on Christmas Day. Shops and hospitality venues will also be told to bring back physical distancing and screens. It came as the number of confirmed Omicron cases in Scotland increased by almost 90% in just 24 hours. A total of 592 people were confirmed with the new variant on Wednesday, up from 296 on the previous day. Scots urged to limit socialising to three households Jabs need a major scaling up - but can it be done? Respiratory health expert Prof James Chalmers predicted further restrictions could be imminent as experts learn more about the new variant. The Scottish Conservatives said the restrictions were a measured response to last week'sOmicron evidence paper,externalwhich painted a ""scary and bleak picture"". Asked on BBC Radio'sGood Morning Scotlandprogramme if there could be another change to the rules before Christmas, Mr Swinney said: ""Potentially that would be the case but we obviously want to avoid that. ""We hope that we have done enough in the announcements that were made yesterday and we hope that members of the public and businesses will work with us in a cooperative spirit to make sure that we can take these provision forward."" Mr Swinney said he was ""optimistic"" enough was being done for now but cautioned that the percentage of Omicron cases in Scotland had soared from 2% about 10 days ago to more than 27%. ""We have a variant that is very powerful, that is growing at an alarming rate, and we face a very severe situation,"" he added. At Holyrood, Ms Sturgeon said she would have tightened hospitality rules further if she had financial support from the UK Treasury. Asked about this, Mr Swinney said they would have liked to extend physical distancing guidance and limit capacities at certain venues. The deputy first minister also said he expected the new measures to extend into the new year. Mr Swinney added people do not have to cancel their plans to attend mass events, such as a panto or a football match, but urged them to ensure they are fully vaccinated and to take a lateral flow test before they attend. Scotland aims to offer a booster shot to everyone over the age of 18 by the end of the month Scottish Conservative health spokesman Dr Sandesh Gulhane said Omicron was ""spreading like wildfire through our communities"". He said the new guidance was ""measured and what we need at the moment"" but further restrictions should not be ruled out as long as there is government support for businesses. The practising GP also described boosters as ""the way out of this"" and called for more drop-in vaccination facilities. Meanwhile, Prof Chalmers of Dundee University said the new variant has a rate of infection of 50% - one person with the virus in a room of 100 could infect 50 people. But he said the full picture of the threat it posed was not yet clear. ""I think the government needs to be ready next week, as we get more data on the vaccine protection against severe disease and other gaps that currently need to be filled in terms of our knowledge, to think about what other measures may be required,"" he said. ""If this is as bad as we think it is going to be there may still be other measures required over the Christmas and new year period."" Why do boosters work if two doses struggle? What are the new Covid rules across the UK? Covid in Scotland: Where are the latest cases? Meanwhile, the Scottish Grocers Federation told the programme it was ""the worst time of year"" for its members to introduce a queuing system. And Stephen O'Regan, who runs three Kitty of Shea's bars in Glasgow and Edinburgh, admitted he ""felt sick"" when he heard the first minister's update. The chain is already up to 60% down on bookings and fear some stock, such as the 300 kegs of Guinness ordered for December alone, may go unopened. The lack of detail from the government about the restrictions was ""frightening"", he added. Ms Sturgeon last week said that Scotland was facing a ""likely tsunami"" of new infections of Covid-19 in the weeks ahead, with a ""very significant"" impact on health services. In response, work is under way to ensure all eligible adults receive their booster vaccination by the end of the year. And guidelines limiting socialising to three adults and measures to cut down crowding in shops and bars were announced on Tuesday. However, schools are to remain open, with Ms Sturgeon saying it was a ""key aim to ensure that schools stay open if at all possible to minimise further disruption to education"".

"Max Verstappen won his first world title in controversial circumstances after a late-race safety car Formula 1's governing body says the controversial Abu Dhabi Grand Prix is ""tarnishing the image"" of the sport. The FIA will conduct a ""detailed analysis and clarification exercise"" into the running of Sunday's race, with all the teams and drivers, ""to draw any lessons from the situation"". It is an effective admission of mistakes in the running of the race that decided the world championship. Race director Michael Masi's actions are at the centre of the controversy. The Australian appeared not to follow the rules and standard protocol on restarting the race after a late-race safety-car period, but he is not mentioned in the FIA statement. Masi's decisions left Mercedes driver Lewis Hamilton, who had led for the vast majority of the race and was on course for the world title, as a sitting duck on old tyres, with Max Verstappen's Red Bull behind him on fresh rubber. The race was restarted for one final lap and the Dutchman passed Hamilton to win and take the drivers' title. The Sports Desk podcast: Winning Formula? Hamilton, Verstappen & Netflix drive F1 resurgence The FIA's statement looks to be extending an olive branch to Mercedes, who have announced they intend to appeal against Sunday night's decision to reject their initial protest against the race result. Mercedes have been in talks with the FIA since the race as they seek redress for what happened at Yas Marina. Mercedes have until about 19:00 BST on Thursday to decide whether to press on with that appeal. 'We sometimes hated each other' - Verstappen on Hamilton This video can not be played I think races should be won on the track - Verstappen tells BBC sports editor Dan Roan The FIA made its announcement after a meeting of its World Council, F1's legislative body, on Wednesday. It said that the circumstances surrounding the safety car and communications between teams and Masi had ""generated significant misunderstanding and reactions from Formula 1 teams, drivers and fans"". It referred to the controversy over why Masi let only some lapped cars unlap themselves and did not comply with rules about the the timing of the restart of the race, describing it as ""an argument"" that was ""tarnishing the image of the championship and the due celebration"" of both Max Verstappen's drivers' title and Mercedes' eighth constructors' crown. And it pledged that ""clarity [would] be provided to the participants, media, and fans about the current regulations to preserve the competitive nature of our sport while ensuring the safety of the drivers and officials"". This would be done in time for ""any identified meaningful feedback and conclusions to be made before the beginning of the 2022 season"". At a news conference on Wednesday at Red Bull's UK F1 headquarters, Verstappen and Red Bull team principal Christian Horner said Masi needed more support to be able to do his job effectively. Verstappen said: ""Michael is a nice guy and he tries his very best and it's very unfair to now start hating on him because it is a very tough job."" Horner added: ""Michael has been under massive pressure from all sides."" After the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix, the penultimate race of the season, Horner said that F1 was missing the late Charlie Whiting, who was race director as one of his responsibilities in his role as FIA F1 director. Horner said: ""You have to remember Charlie had Herbie [Blash, the former deputy race director] sitting next to him. They were a double act. ""And I think that it's a little unfair that, you know, he's [Masi] up there on his own. He doesn't have any form of support. ""And I think the level at which teams are now operating, all the data and information that they have available to them is immense and I think that the takeaway from this season - not just from Abu Dhabi - is: How can we do a better job? How can the FIA do a better job?"" The FIA also provided more clarity on the plans for the new engine formula to be introduced in 2026. In addition to plans to use 100% sustainable fuel and lower costs, it said that the energy from the hybrid part of the engine would go up to 350kW - more than double the current 160kW. In addition, it confirmed that the MGU-H - the part of the hybrid system that recovers energy from the exhaust - would be removed. A cap on engine costs will also be introduced. The overall aims of the new engine formula, it said, would be to ensure a ""powerful and high-revving power unit, car performance, sound, drivers' ability to race, avoiding excessive differentiation"".

"This afternoon's No 10 press conference was a gloomy affair. The increase in the Omicron variant that we'd barely heard of a fortnight ago is so steep it was almost a straight line on one of Prof Chris Whitty's famous graphs. The number of Covid cases reported on Wednesday was the highest yet during the pandemic. You read that right: the highest ever during these tough two years. While there is so much we don't yet know about the severity of the Omicron variant itself, and it's impossible to be clear about its precise effect, the sheer number of cases is mind-boggling to contemplate. New UK cases record as Whitty warns 'more to come' Will tougher measures stop the spread of Omicron? Even if, crossing every finger, the number of deaths remains low because of vaccinations, we are looking at a likely period of serious disruption to much of our lives. And the message from England's top doctor was clear. He was at pains to repeat it several times: in the run-up to Christmas, stay at home unless it really matters. His language about ""prioritising"" or ""de-prioritising"" events might have been less blunt. But under repeated questioning that was the clear implication. That's not, though, a message the prime minister was willing, or perhaps able, to repeat. The political pressure on him not to introduce more restrictions is intense after 100 of his backbenchers stuck two fingers up at him on Tuesday night byvoting against part of his pandemic plan. But Prof Whitty's message will likely be heard loud and clear: what we all do in the next few days and weeks will make a difference to how fast the pandemic spreads. His call is already alarming the hospitality industry. Without official closures or limits there won't be extra financial help, at least not at this stage. But the message from the press conference is bound to lead to empty tables, and less custom. MPs will inevitably start to question the fairness of that. Once again, Number 10 is in the grip of a fast-moving crisis with consequences not just for the country's health but for the economy, and the nation's wealth too.

"Helen Williams (centre), who is still shielding from Covid, says she ""recoils"" when she sees people in shops without masks While many have enjoyed the freedom of relaxed Covid restrictions, it has been a different story for those shielding. Although shielding officially ended in April, for many life has never returned to anything resembling normality. ""I still haven't dropped my shield completely,"" said Helen Williams, 55, who has effectively spent 19 months in a state of lockdown. Helen is one of the 130,000 people in Wales who were told to shield at the start of the pandemic. Tougher Welsh Covid rules at Christmas not ruled out Covid risk 'eight times higher' for shielding group 'Shielders have definitely been forgotten' She had a life-changing kidney transplant 10 years ago, but because of her immune response to the operation she now has to take two immunosuppressant drugs and steroids for life to ensure her body does not reject her kidney. The immunosuppressants mean her immune system is weakened, making her extremely vulnerable to coronavirus. Helen says while she can cope with the lack of contact, it has been very tough on her daughter Eleri ""I live in a permanent state of anxiety when I go out. If I have to go shopping and I see people aren't wearing masks, I just recoil,"" said the mother from Margam, Neath Port Talbot. ""Whereas most people are doing the Christmas going out and socialising, I'm withdrawing and that makes me sad. ""A lot of people might catch [Covid] and recover, I might catch it and die, but the other thing is if I don't die I would very likely lose my transplant."" When shielding ended in Wales in April, chief medical officer Dr Frank Athertonsaid it is unlikely to be used again. Deputy chief medical officer Gill Richardson has said people who are extremely vulnerable should ""do their own risk assessments"" before they go out. Dalila Tremarias, who is also shielding, said ""there's plenty of disinformation out there"" Dalila Tremarias, 34, from Cardiff, said those who were clinically vulnerable were continuing to have restricted lives. Dalila, who has a four-year-old son, has lupus SLE and lupus nephritis, an auto-immune condition that attacks her body. She has been on immunosuppressants for more than 10 years. ""I wish I could just go and plan Christmas, relax and enjoy again that time with family, friends and loved ones,"" said Dalila. ""I was going to be able to meet loved ones and friends and to have a different Christmas this time compared to last year, which was so difficult in isolation."" But she said the emergence of the Omicron variant has made her reconsider her Christmas plans, and she thinks people who are vulnerable need more information on the variant. ""We still need to know the data related to this new variant and how to safely move forward as a vulnerable person, considering that we have children, families and jobs,"" she said. ""We need to know how this variant affects our situation because it's different to the general population."" Johanna Greenaway, who is classed as extremely vulnerable, says she no longer socialises Johanna Greenaway, 79, lives in Caerphilly with her husband. She was diagnosed with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia in 2009 and is having treatment. Her medication makes her extremely vulnerable, and means it's very unlikely the grandmother-of-five has received any protection from the vaccines. Johanna used to regularly attend church and was a member of the Women's Institute. She's also volunteered for Macmillan fundraising group and Blood Cancer UK. ""It's the general everyday kinds of things that I miss. Just meeting with friends for coffee,"" she said. ""I don't feel like it's Christmas.

"The government has been urged by its official immigration advisers to make it easier for foreign care workers to come to the UK. The Migration Advisory Committee (MAC) said the sector was facing ""severe and increasing"" problems with hiring and retaining staff after Brexit. It suggested changes to allow employers to sponsor visas for workers on more than Â£20,480 a year. The Home Office said it would consider the recommendation carefully. The proposal was welcomed by several groups in the care sector, who have long argued less stringent rules are needed to boost recruitment. Research charity Skills for Care estimated last month that just over 11% of vacancies in the sector are currently unfilled. What are the challenges facing social care? Help for home changes pledged in social care plan Social care needs 'proper wages' - migration chair The MAC's recommendation came as it published initial findings of a review it is conducting into the effect of Brexit on social care recruitment. Since the UK left the EU, social care workers from EU countries are no longer automatically eligible to work in the UK and instead have to apply for a visa. The committee said all social care workers should be able to apply under the UK's ""shortage occupation list"", meaning they need fewer points and a lower salary to meet the criteria. They also said they should be able to apply for the government's special visa for health and social care workers. Currently, only senior roles with qualifications above a certain level are eligible for these routes. The MAC recommended the move to help ""alleviate"" short-term recruitment problems, which it said were likely to worsen post-Brexit. However, it also concluded many issues predated the UK's exit, and ""underfunding"" of the sector was ""the underlying cause"" of difficulties. The recommendation to widen access to the shortage occupation list was welcomed by industry groups Care England and the Homecare Association. Mike Padgham, chairman of the Independent Care Group, also said a relaxation of immigration rules ""can't come soon enough"". He added that the sector was already ""on its knees"" trying to cope with self-isolation caused by the spread of the Omicron variant of Covid. Migration Minister Kevin Foster said the government's post-Brexit immigration system was ""delivering on the people's priorities of getting businesses to invest in the domestic workforce while attracting those with the skills we need."" He said senior roles were already eligible for the easier visa routes, ""but businesses need to make long-term investments in the UK domestic workforce, including offering hard working care workers the rewarding packages they deserve.""

"The cost of living surged by 5.1% in the 12 months to November, up from 4.2% the month before, and its highest level since September 2011. Higher transport and energy costs drove the rise, which was above forecasts of a 4.7% increase, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. Its chief economist Grant Fitzner said more expensive fuel, energy, clothing and second hand cars were big factors. The cost of raw materials also rose significantly, he added. Inflation is the rate at which prices are rising - if the cost of a Â£1 jar of jam rises by 5p, then jam inflation is 5%. It applies to services too, like having your nails done or getting your car cleaned. You may not notice low levels of inflation from month to month, but in the long term, these price rises can have a big impact on how much you can buy with your money - sometimes referred to as the cost of living. Why is the cost of living going up? Since the UK economy reopened after lockdown, companies have struggled to keep up with a surge in consumer demand. Global supply chain problems, staff shortages and rapid demand for oil and gas have all driven up prices. The end of Covid support schemes and Brexit have also played a part. In November, petrol prices jumped to the highest ever recorded - 145.8p a litre - while the cost of used cars jumped due to shortages of new vehicles. A global shortage of computer chips for in new carshas led to a shortage of vehicles, leading to increased demand in the second hand car market. Even before Wednesday's figures, the food and drink industry had warnedthat the soaring cost of raw materials and ingredients was having a ""terrifying"" impact on consumer prices. Chrissy Jones from Frome has noticed energy price rises the most Consumers are feeling the impact of price rises. Chrissy Jones, from Frome, says prices for everything from insurance to food and petrol have gone up. ""We can't plan for the future,"" she says. Energy bills in particular are higher. The former People's Energy customer was spending about Â£1,000 for both electricity and gas each year. But when the firm went bust, she was switched onto the cheapest available tariff with British Gas, which is about double that. ""Do I fix at that price, or do I hope that the situation gets better? It's a bit of a gamble,"" she says. Ms Jones is on a pension and says a lack of security around knowing what she might be spending on bills in the New Year means that she and her family are putting off plans. A holiday in the next year was unlikely and her hopes to adopt a rescue dog were being put on hold. ""It wouldn't be fair on the dog and it wouldn't be fair on our purse,"" she says. ""It's just incredibly worrying - you wonder where it's going to end. How much more [are prices] going to go up?"" That's a concern. A quadrupling of natural gas prices in the last year has still to show its full impact on domestic energy prices. Many raw material costs are still rising, which will feed into higher prices if companies cannot absorb them. Rising inflation is not just an issue for the UK, and the government's hands are tied when it comes to dealing with what is a global problem.The latest figures for the US show prices rose 6.8% in the year to November,the highest level for almost 40 years. Wage inflation is also a factor. The latest inflation figure is substantially above the most recent figures on average pay rises of 4.3%, meaning living standards are effectively falling. On Wednesday, Britain's most powerful trade union, Unite, said it would act to ensure this effective pay cut was reversed. ""Current estimates suggest that costs for the typical UK family will jump by Â£1,700 in 2022,"" said Unite general secretary Sharon Graham. ""Workers did not create this cost-of-living crisis so why should they pay for it?"" On Wednesday, the ONS said the retail price inflation (RPI) measure - which includes housing costs, such as council tax, and is still linked to final salary pension payments, train tickets, mobile phone tariffs, and interest on student loans - rose to 7.1%. That's up from 6%, and its highest since March 1991. RPI rather than CPI is also used by unions for pay bargaining, and Ms Graham said members should fight for rises that matched this measure. ""Employers favour the CPI in cost calculations because it saves them money, but the truth is that this is a hidden tax on workers' wages,"" she said. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said on Wednesday he understood the impact being felt by consumers. He said: ""We know how challenging rising inflation can be for families and households which is why we're spending Â£4.2bn to support living standards and provide targeted measures for the most vulnerable over the winter months. But Labour claimed the government is not doing nearly enough to tackle the problem, especially as further inflationary pressures from rising energy costs are coming down the line. Shadow chief secretary to the Treasury Pat McFadden said: ""These figures are a stark illustration of the cost-of-living crisis facing families this Christmas. ""Instead of taking action, the government are looking the other way, blaming 'global problems' while they trap us in a high-tax, low-growth cycle."" The unexpectedly sharp jump in inflation, now more than twice the Bank of England's 2% target rate, will certainly intensify debate over a rise. On Tuesday, the International Monetary Fund predicted inflation would reach around 5.5% early next year - its highest in 30 years - and warned the Bank not to succumb to ""inaction bias"". The Bank has resisted a rate rise amid uncertainty aboutthe impact of the Omicron variant on economic growth and people's finances. Economist Samuel Tombs, at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said inflation is now ""uncomfortably high"" for the Bank, but believes rate-setters will still hold fire when they meet this week."" Yael Selfin, economist at consultancy KPMG, also thought the Bank would ""adopt a wait-and-see approach at this week's meeting"". Prices are rising at the fastest rate for a decade, 13 years if you use the ONS' favourite measure that includes owner-occupier housing costs. Inflation has risen above 5% more quickly than expected by the Bank of England and others, on a path to more than 5.5% by the spring, and it is likely to stay above the Bank's 2% target for the next two years. All of this reflects the lived experience of us all in petrol forecourts, supermarkets and department stores. The impact on living standards is material with real incomes now likely to be falling again. It does not make an interest rate rise on Thursday a done deal, given the economic uncertainty surrounding the rapid spread of the Omicron variant of coronavirus. The key economic uncertainty for the Bank and the Treasury is now what happens in companies and unions with how wages are set. When combined with ongoing labour shortages, there is a lot of pressure for companies to give considerable wage rises in the new year. While Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said he welcomes such a move, fear of a spiral of rising wages and prices is precisely what would lead to the Bank of England having to raise rates more quickly than currently expected over the next year. Given there is little expected respite from energy prices and rising taxes, an interest rate rise on the cards in the next few months, and ongoing Omicron restrictions, the outlook for early 2022 remains challenging for consumers and businesses.

"This video can not be played Sergio Aguero announces he is retiring from football to protect his health Sergio Aguero says he is ""proud"" of his career after accepting the ""very difficult"" reality of retiring from the sport to protect his health. The 33-year-old sobbed while announcing the news on Wednesday, fewer than six months after joining Barcelona. The former Manchester City striker was taken to hospital on 30 October after experiencing ""chest discomfort"" during a 1-1 draw with Alaves. ""The decision I have made, I have taken it for my health,"" said Aguero. Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola was among a small crowd watching Aguero make the announcement next to the Nou Camp pitch. Aguero, who ends his career with 427 goals in 786 games, took time to compose himself after crying at the start of the event and added: ""This conference is to communicate that I have decided to stop playing football. It's a very difficult moment. ""When they did the first physical test on me in the clinic, the medical staff called me to tell me there was a very big possibility that I wouldn't be able to keep playing. From that point I was processing it all but it wasn't easy. One of the doctors told me straight up, 'that's enough'. ""I want to tell everyone that I did everything possible. I dreamt about playing football since I was five years old and I first touched a ball. I never thought I would get to Europe, so I want to show my gratitude to everyone regardless of where I trained. ""I'm proud of the career I've had and am fortunate it is happening to me now rather than before. I don't know what awaits me in the next life but I know there are a lot of people who love me and want the best for me."" How Aguero went from 'worst trainer in the world' to Man City 'icon' 5 Live Sport: 'All about Aguero' All the reaction and memories as Man City great Aguero retires, all in one place 'I'm gutted': Fans pay tribute to retiring Aguero Aguero is the fourth-highest scoring player in Premier League history with 184 goals in 275 games, behind only Alan Shearer (260), Wayne Rooney (208) and Andrew Cole (187). He is also the league's highest-scoring overseas player, having registered nine more goals than Thierry Henry (175). Aguero scored every 108 minutes in the Premier League, comfortably the best rate in the competition's history. Indeed, he could play another 2,520 minutes (28 games) of Premier League football without scoring and would still have the best minutes-per-goal ratio of any top-flight player with more than 20 goals. The Argentine scored 18 hat-tricks in his career, including 12 in the Premier League - a record in England's top flight. He scored 20+ goals in all competitions in 12 of 13 campaigns between 2007/08 and 2019/20, reaching 30 or more on five separate occasions during his time at Manchester City. Aguero scored 36 goals for Manchester City in the Champions League, the joint-highest total a player has registered for an English side in the competition's history (along with former Chelsea striker Didier Drogba). He found the net against 128 different opponents, including the likes of Barcelona, Real Madrid, Bayern Munich, Chelsea, Liverpool and Manchester United. There were 16 years and 332 days between Aguero's first career goal in November 2004 (for Independiente) and his final strike for Barcelona - against Real Madrid in October 2021. This video can not be played Farewell Aguero - why Man City striker is a Premier League legend Despite an untimely end to his spell at Barcelona, there can be no doubting Aguero's status as one of the foremost strikers of the 21st Century. After starting out with Independiente in Argentina he moved to Atletico Madrid, winning the Europa League in 2010 and scoring 101 goals in 234 appearances. That record attracted the interest of an upwardly mobile Manchester City, who paid a reported Â£38m to bring him to Etihad Stadium. He would go on to become a club and Premier League legend during a 10-year spell in England, winning five Premier League titles, one FA Cup and six League Cups. ""Atletico Madrid took a bet on me at 18 years old, that I could do things well in Europe,"" Aguero said at his news conference. ""People at Manchester City, you all know how I feel. They look after me really well. ""When a player plays, they always want to keep winning more things, but I think I can be happy with the titles I won. Anyone can always do a bit more, but I think I did my best for me and my clubs."" Aguero left City in the summer having broken their all-time scoring record, with 260 goals in 390 games, including 16 hat-tricks. The Argentine is also responsible for arguably the Premier League's most iconic moment,scoring with virtually the last kick of the 2011-12 seasonto seal a victory over Queens Park Rangers that earned Manchester City a first top-flight title since 1968 and denied fierce rivals Manchester United by virtue of goal difference. Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola attended the news conference in Barcelona BBC Sport chief football writer Phil McNulty: Sergio Aguero's legacy makes him one of the towering and most significant figures in the history of Manchester City and the Premier League. Aguero not only left City at the end of last season as their all-time record goalscorer, he also scored arguably the most memorable goal in Premier League history. The strike to win the title in 2012 was his great, over-arching moment but Aguero provided so many key goals in his decade at City, a goalscorer of unrelenting threat and remarkable consistency - powerful, combative and a danger to any defence he came up against. Yes, he will be remembered above all for that one moment in the Manchester sunshine that sparked hysteria at Etihad Stadium but Aguero's time at City and in the Premier League leaves a body of work that quite rightly affords him legendary status forever at the club. When City came out of the darkness and into the light under Roberto Mancini, then Manuel Pellegrini and latterly the great Guardiola, Aguero's brilliance and record ensured he was at the forefront of their resurgence. Aguero's great friendship with compatriot Lionel Messi meant a move to Barcelona was an attractive one after it became clear he would be allowed to leave Manchester City. He had won over City boss Pep Guardiola, who initially had concerns about the striker's ability to fit into his style of play, but injuries limited Aguero's playing time during his final season at the Etihad. But the switch to Barcelona went badly from the start. The club's financial problems meant there were problems registering their new signings, including Aguero. And those same issues led to the departure of Messi to Paris St-Germain. When Aguero was eventually registered, he suffered a calf injury that kept him out until October and he only made five appearances for the club in all. He scored a 90th-minute consolation in his only El Clasico appearance against Real Madrid, on 24 October, and three days later made his first start for the club. But his withdrawal against Alaves in October was followed by a ""cardiac exam"" and Aguero said on social media he would follow doctors' advice in making a decision about his playing future. He said he would take 90 days to assess his progress, with reports suggesting he had beendiagnosed with cardiac arrhythmia - an irregular heartbeat,external. But his decision has come sooner than expected. His final contribution for Argentina came at the summer's Copa America, a substitute appearance in the quarter-final victory over Ecuador asLa Albiceleste went on to win the trophyfor the first time in 28 years. This video can not be played Copa America 2021: Superb Angel di Maria goal helps Argentina beat Brazil South American football expert Tim Vickery There were still a couple of things to cross off on Aguero's list of things to do. One was to round off his career where it all started, at Independiente in Argentina. When Independiente sold him to Atletico Madrid, they entirely rebuilt the stadium on the proceeds and it was always a dream of Aguero himself and of the club's fans that he would one day come back and play in the house he built So scratch that one, it seems. The other one is another World Cup with Argentina because there are a couple of little holes in a fabulous career. One is the Champions League and the other is a great tournament. He did win the Copa America in the middle of the year, but he was a reserve, he hardly got on the field in the knockout stages and he didn't score. Although he scored 42 goals for Argentina, and only two men have scored more - Gabriel Batistuta and Lionel Messi - he never truly had a great tournament and quite often come the end-of-season tournaments he was dragging his weary carcass around the field. Maybe it is a shame Pep Guardiola didn't get his hands on him earlier because the best tournament he played was the last World Cup in Russia, where Argentina were otherwise an absolute shambles. Now they are the best team they have been since he started playing for them, it would have been lovely for him to have one last go at the World Cup in a year's time. It is not a moment of his choosing but what a legacy he has left and what a magnificent player he was. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"This video can not be played Watch: The moment MPs approved the introduction of a Covid pass in England Adults in England must now show a Covid pass to enter nightclubs, big sports matches and other large events - despite 100 Conservative MPs voting against the government's plans. The new rules - which kick in today - require proof of double-vaccination, or a recent negative test, to enter certain venues. MPs approved the measure in Tuesday's vote on England's new Covid rules. Despite the revolt by Tory MPs, the plans passed thanks to Labour support. The changes come as Dr Jenny Harries, chief executive of the UK Health Security Agency, said growth of the Omicron variant over the coming days would be ""staggering"", with infections currently doubling in less than two days in most UK regions. She told a committee of MPs the new variant was ""probably the most significant threat we've had since the start of the pandemic"". Where will I need to use a Covid passport? What do I need to watch sport? Johnson's biggest rebellion - and why it matters The Commons also backed - with smaller Conservative rebellions - the continuation of mandatory mask-wearing in most indoor settings, and compulsory vaccination for NHS workers in England. The scrapping of self-isolation for fully vaccinated Covid contacts - in favour of daily lateral flow tests - passed unanimously without a vote. The rebellion on Covid passes was by far the biggest since Boris Johnson took office. At Prime Minister's Questions, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said Mr Johnson was ""too weak to lead"" and suggested that, after the rebellion, he hadlost the ""trust and the authority"" to govern the country. Mr Johnson said the government was taking a ""balanced and proportionate"" approach to Covid regulations and accused Labour of ""playing political games"". Earlier, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps told BBC Breakfast he hoped there would be no need for further Covid measures. ""We've got in place now the measures that we believe will see us through to the new year,"" he said. If there did turn out to be a need for additional restrictions, he was ""certain"" Parliament would be recalled, Mr Shapps said. Over-18s in England must prove they are double vaccinated,externalagainst Covid-19, had a negative PCR or lateral flow test result within the last 48 hours, or have an exemption, to enter large events and venues You can get a pass digitally on theNHS app,externalor theNHS website,external. You can alsorequest a letter,externalfrom the NHS to confirm your vaccine status, or show test results with a text message or email from NHS Test and Trace Passes based on test results expire after 48 hours, while vaccine passes need to be renewed in the app or on the website after 30 days The rules apply to nightclubs, indoor unseated venues with more than 500 people, unseated outdoor venues with more than 4,000 people, and any venue with more than 10,000 people Covid passport schemes are already in operation in Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales One Tory rebel, Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, said the scale of the revolt meant a leadership challenge to Mr Johnson had ""got to be on the cards"" next year. And former Tory chief whip, Mark Harper MP, said: ""You either listen and you respond and you do things differently - or you ignore what you have been told and you plough on regardless, and then this will happen over and over again."" But former cabinet minister Damian Green, who also rebelled, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that for him it was ""absolutely not"" a vote demonstrating a lack of confidence in Boris Johnson, adding that he would vote for tougher measures if he believed they would be effective. The spread of the Omicron variant has prompted long queues for booster vaccinations and pressures on supplies lateral flow and PCR tests, although the government insists it has enough stockpiled. West End shows havescrapped performances due to outbreaks,Premier League matches have been postponedand pubs and restaurants reporta wave of Christmas bookings being cancelled. Boris Johnson didn't lose. But no prime minister wants to feel they're losing the argument in much of their own party. And the scale of the rebellion is even worse than predicted. Not just a slap on the wrist for Mr Johnson, but a very serious rejection of his plan. Something that can't be dismissed, despite his own personal appeals to his ranks. Read more from Laurahere Prof Graham Medley from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine told BBC Radio 4's Today programme there was a ""very real possibility"" of the NHS being overwhelmed if Omicron infections spread to older age groups, as experience suggested they would. Although vaccination and immunity through prior infections are higher now, reducing the risk to many individuals, the numbers in hospital could still get ""very large"", perhaps up to 2,000 a day, he suggested. On Tuesday, the UK recorded 59,610 new Covid cases, the highest number since January, along with 150 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test. The UK Health Security Agency said633 further UK Omicron cases were reported on Tuesday, taking the total number of confirmed cases of the variant to 5,346.,externalBut the agency's modelling suggests the real figure may be much higher. Meanwhile, a total of 513,722 booster and third doses were given across the UK on Monday. InScotland have been urged to limit socialising to three householdsat a time, with shops and hospitality venues to be told to reinstate physical distancing and protective screens.

Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola was among a small crowd watching Aguero make the announcement next to the Nou Camp pitch. Aguero, who ends his career with 427 goals in 786 games, took time to compose himself after crying at the start of the event and added: ""This conference is to communicate that I have decided to stop playing football. It's a very difficult moment. ""When they did the first physical test on me in the clinic, the medical staff called me to tell me there was a very big possibility that I wouldn't be able to keep playing. From that point I was processing it all but it wasn't easy. One of the doctors told me straight up, 'that's enough'. ""I want to tell everyone that I did everything possible. I dreamt about playing football since I was five years old and I first touched a ball. I never thought I would get to Europe, so I want to show my gratitude to everyone regardless of where I trained. ""I'm proud of the career I've had and am fortunate it is happening to me now rather than before. I don't know what awaits me in the next life but I know there are a lot of people who love me and want the best for me."" How Aguero went from 'worst trainer in the world' to Man City 'icon' 5 Live Sport: 'All about Aguero' All the reaction and memories as Man City great Aguero retires, all in one place 'I'm gutted': Fans pay tribute to retiring Aguero Aguero is the fourth-highest scoring player in Premier League history with 184 goals in 275 games, behind only Alan Shearer (260), Wayne Rooney (208) and Andrew Cole (187). He is also the league's highest-scoring overseas player, having registered nine more goals than Thierry Henry (175). Aguero scored every 108 minutes in the Premier League, comfortably the best rate in the competition's history. Indeed, he could play another 2,520 minutes (28 games) of Premier League football without scoring and would still have the best minutes-per-goal ratio of any top-flight player with more than 20 goals. The Argentine scored 18 hat-tricks in his career, including 12 in the Premier League - a record in England's top flight. He scored 20+ goals in all competitions in 12 of 13 campaigns between 2007/08 and 2019/20, reaching 30 or more on five separate occasions during his time at Manchester City. Aguero scored 36 goals for Manchester City in the Champions League, the joint-highest total a player has registered for an English side in the competition's history (along with former Chelsea striker Didier Drogba). He found the net against 128 different opponents, including the likes of Barcelona, Real Madrid, Bayern Munich, Chelsea, Liverpool and Manchester United. There were 16 years and 332 days between Aguero's first career goal in November 2004 (for Independiente) and his final strike for Barcelona - against Real Madrid in October 2021. This video can not be played Farewell Aguero - why Man City striker is a Premier League legend Despite an untimely end to his spell at Barcelona, there can be no doubting Aguero's status as one of the foremost strikers of the 21st Century. After starting out with Independiente in Argentina he moved to Atletico Madrid, winning the Europa League in 2010 and scoring 101 goals in 234 appearances. That record attracted the interest of an upwardly mobile Manchester City, who paid a reported Â£38m to bring him to Etihad Stadium. He would go on to become a club and Premier League legend during a 10-year spell in England, winning five Premier League titles, one FA Cup and six League Cups. ""Atletico Madrid took a bet on me at 18 years old, that I could do things well in Europe,"" Aguero said at his news conference. ""People at Manchester City, you all know how I feel. They look after me really well. ""When a player plays, they always want to keep winning more things, but I think I can be happy with the titles I won. Anyone can always do a bit more, but I think I did my best for me and my clubs."" Aguero left City in the summer having broken their all-time scoring record, with 260 goals in 390 games, including 16 hat-tricks. The Argentine is also responsible for arguably the Premier League's most iconic moment,scoring with virtually the last kick of the 2011-12 seasonto seal a victory over Queens Park Rangers that earned Manchester City a first top-flight title since 1968 and denied fierce rivals Manchester United by virtue of goal difference. Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola attended the news conference in Barcelona BBC Sport chief football writer Phil McNulty: Sergio Aguero's legacy makes him one of the towering and most significant figures in the history of Manchester City and the Premier League. Aguero not only left City at the end of last season as their all-time record goalscorer, he also scored arguably the most memorable goal in Premier League history. The strike to win the title in 2012 was his great, over-arching moment but Aguero provided so many key goals in his decade at City, a goalscorer of unrelenting threat and remarkable consistency - powerful, combative and a danger to any defence he came up against. Yes, he will be remembered above all for that one moment in the Manchester sunshine that sparked hysteria at Etihad Stadium but Aguero's time at City and in the Premier League leaves a body of work that quite rightly affords him legendary status forever at the club. When City came out of the darkness and into the light under Roberto Mancini, then Manuel Pellegrini and latterly the great Guardiola, Aguero's brilliance and record ensured he was at the forefront of their resurgence. Aguero's great friendship with compatriot Lionel Messi meant a move to Barcelona was an attractive one after it became clear he would be allowed to leave Manchester City. He had won over City boss Pep Guardiola, who initially had concerns about the striker's ability to fit into his style of play, but injuries limited Aguero's playing time during his final season at the Etihad. But the switch to Barcelona went badly from the start. The club's financial problems meant there were problems registering their new signings, including Aguero. And those same issues led to the departure of Messi to Paris St-Germain. When Aguero was eventually registered, he suffered a calf injury that kept him out until October and he only made five appearances for the club in all. He scored a 90th-minute consolation in his only El Clasico appearance against Real Madrid, on 24 October, and three days later made his first start for the club. But his withdrawal against Alaves in October was followed by a ""cardiac exam"" and Aguero said on social media he would follow doctors' advice in making a decision about his playing future. He said he would take 90 days to assess his progress, with reports suggesting he had beendiagnosed with cardiac arrhythmia - an irregular heartbeat,external. But his decision has come sooner than expected. His final contribution for Argentina came at the summer's Copa America, a substitute appearance in the quarter-final victory over Ecuador asLa Albiceleste went on to win the trophyfor the first time in 28 years. This video can not be played Copa America 2021: Superb Angel di Maria goal helps Argentina beat Brazil South American football expert Tim Vickery There were still a couple of things to cross off on Aguero's list of things to do. One was to round off his career where it all started, at Independiente in Argentina. When Independiente sold him to Atletico Madrid, they entirely rebuilt the stadium on the proceeds and it was always a dream of Aguero himself and of the club's fans that he would one day come back and play in the house he built So scratch that one, it seems. The other one is another World Cup with Argentina because there are a couple of little holes in a fabulous career. One is the Champions League and the other is a great tournament. He did win the Copa America in the middle of the year, but he was a reserve, he hardly got on the field in the knockout stages and he didn't score. Although he scored 42 goals for Argentina, and only two men have scored more - Gabriel Batistuta and Lionel Messi - he never truly had a great tournament and quite often come the end-of-season tournaments he was dragging his weary carcass around the field. Maybe it is a shame Pep Guardiola didn't get his hands on him earlier because the best tournament he played was the last World Cup in Russia, where Argentina were otherwise an absolute shambles. Now they are the best team they have been since he started playing for them, it would have been lovely for him to have one last go at the World Cup in a year's time. It is not a moment of his choosing but what a legacy he has left and what a magnificent player he was. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"This video can not be played Watch: The moment MPs approved the introduction of a Covid pass in England Adults in England must now show a Covid pass to enter nightclubs, big sports matches and other large events - despite 100 Conservative MPs voting against the government's plans. The new rules - which kick in today - require proof of double-vaccination, or a recent negative test, to enter certain venues. MPs approved the measure in Tuesday's vote on England's new Covid rules. Despite the revolt by Tory MPs, the plans passed thanks to Labour support. The changes come as Dr Jenny Harries, chief executive of the UK Health Security Agency, said growth of the Omicron variant over the coming days would be ""staggering"", with infections currently doubling in less than two days in most UK regions. She told a committee of MPs the new variant was ""probably the most significant threat we've had since the start of the pandemic"". Where will I need to use a Covid passport? What do I need to watch sport? Johnson's biggest rebellion - and why it matters The Commons also backed - with smaller Conservative rebellions - the continuation of mandatory mask-wearing in most indoor settings, and compulsory vaccination for NHS workers in England. The scrapping of self-isolation for fully vaccinated Covid contacts - in favour of daily lateral flow tests - passed unanimously without a vote. The rebellion on Covid passes was by far the biggest since Boris Johnson took office. At Prime Minister's Questions, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said Mr Johnson was ""too weak to lead"" and suggested that, after the rebellion, he hadlost the ""trust and the authority"" to govern the country. Mr Johnson said the government was taking a ""balanced and proportionate"" approach to Covid regulations and accused Labour of ""playing political games"". Earlier, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps told BBC Breakfast he hoped there would be no need for further Covid measures. ""We've got in place now the measures that we believe will see us through to the new year,"" he said. If there did turn out to be a need for additional restrictions, he was ""certain"" Parliament would be recalled, Mr Shapps said. Over-18s in England must prove they are double vaccinated,externalagainst Covid-19, had a negative PCR or lateral flow test result within the last 48 hours, or have an exemption, to enter large events and venues You can get a pass digitally on theNHS app,externalor theNHS website,external. You can alsorequest a letter,externalfrom the NHS to confirm your vaccine status, or show test results with a text message or email from NHS Test and Trace Passes based on test results expire after 48 hours, while vaccine passes need to be renewed in the app or on the website after 30 days The rules apply to nightclubs, indoor unseated venues with more than 500 people, unseated outdoor venues with more than 4,000 people, and any venue with more than 10,000 people Covid passport schemes are already in operation in Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales One Tory rebel, Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, said the scale of the revolt meant a leadership challenge to Mr Johnson had ""got to be on the cards"" next year. And former Tory chief whip, Mark Harper MP, said: ""You either listen and you respond and you do things differently - or you ignore what you have been told and you plough on regardless, and then this will happen over and over again."" But former cabinet minister Damian Green, who also rebelled, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that for him it was ""absolutely not"" a vote demonstrating a lack of confidence in Boris Johnson, adding that he would vote for tougher measures if he believed they would be effective. The spread of the Omicron variant has prompted long queues for booster vaccinations and pressures on supplies lateral flow and PCR tests, although the government insists it has enough stockpiled. West End shows havescrapped performances due to outbreaks,Premier League matches have been postponedand pubs and restaurants reporta wave of Christmas bookings being cancelled. Boris Johnson didn't lose. But no prime minister wants to feel they're losing the argument in much of their own party. And the scale of the rebellion is even worse than predicted. Not just a slap on the wrist for Mr Johnson, but a very serious rejection of his plan. Something that can't be dismissed, despite his own personal appeals to his ranks. Read more from Laurahere Prof Graham Medley from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine told BBC Radio 4's Today programme there was a ""very real possibility"" of the NHS being overwhelmed if Omicron infections spread to older age groups, as experience suggested they would. Although vaccination and immunity through prior infections are higher now, reducing the risk to many individuals, the numbers in hospital could still get ""very large"", perhaps up to 2,000 a day, he suggested. On Tuesday, the UK recorded 59,610 new Covid cases, the highest number since January, along with 150 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test. The UK Health Security Agency said633 further UK Omicron cases were reported on Tuesday, taking the total number of confirmed cases of the variant to 5,346.,externalBut the agency's modelling suggests the real figure may be much higher. Meanwhile, a total of 513,722 booster and third doses were given across the UK on Monday. InScotland have been urged to limit socialising to three householdsat a time, with shops and hospitality venues to be told to reinstate physical distancing and protective screens.

"Many hundreds of branches have closed in recent years More shared banking hubs will open in UK towns and villages as banks continue to close a swathe of branches. Major banks have signed a new voluntary agreement which means an independent assessment of local needs will be carried out each time a branch is shut. These reviews could recommend a shared branch is opened, an ATM installed or a Post Office upgraded. Banks will commit to deliver whatever is recommended. This should ensure vulnerable customers and businesses have access to cash. An estimated five million people still rely on cash, and basic banking services are considered key to the survival of notes and coins. For example, small businesses unable to deposit their takings nearby may choose to only accept card, rather than cash, payments. Cash access as vital as running water, says Age UK Shops step in to supply cash as ATMs close Each time a core banking service such as a cash machine or bank branch is closed, an assessment will be carried out by Link - the organisation which currently oversees the UK's ATM network. The review will study the cash needs of the community, such as how easy it is to travel to the nearest alternative service, as well as the demographics and vulnerability of local residents. The criteria are set by a group of banks and consumer representatives. Assessment trials over the past year will lead to 11 new ATMs, improved cash services in 30 Post Offices, and five new shared banking hubs all opening in early 2022. A trial of the bank hub has been running in Rochford, Essex At these hubs, run by the Post Office, customers of any bank can access their accounts, deposit cash and cheques, and withdraw money at any time. Trickier enquiries are dealt with by a representative from one of each of the major banks who each visit once a week. The BBC visited a prototype shared banking hub in Rochford, Essex, earlier this year andwas told it had been ""a lifeline""for many people living in the area. Running costs are the same as a small branch, but are shared between different banking groups that use it. The new shared bank branches are expected to open in Acton in London, Syston in Leicestershire, Knaresborough in North Yorkshire, Carnoustie in Angus, and Brixham in Devon. They have seen their last banks close and customers tend to have difficult journeys to reach the nearest branch services. Brixham in Devon is earmarked for a new hub Picturesque Brixham is a thriving fishing port popular with tourists, but when Lloyds closed in September it lost the last bank branch in town. A third of residents are over 65 and often need to travel for basic banking services as the local post office can struggle to cope with demand. Local businesses must also travel or queue for their banking needs, so many are welcoming the plan for a new shared hub. Debbie Fisher has to travel to bank her cash Debbie Fisher, the owner of the Buccaneer Boutique women's clothing store in Brixham, said she still received cheques from some of her customers and liked to accept cash payments too. ""Not having a branch is inconvenient as I have to go [to another town] before I open up the shop,"" she said. ""It would be fantastic to have a hub. ""It is desperately needed to keep the town together."" From the summer of 2022 any community that has already lost its banking services can request an assessment by Link. While shared hubs may be welcomed in these local communities, the plan for five hubs and the promise of more to come will be dwarfed by the scale of bank branch closures across the UK. More than 4,000 branches have closed since the start of 2015, and another 220 are already scheduled to close next year. Consumer group Which? has called for an immediate halt to more closures, to allow the new plans and legislation to be introduced. ""The alarming acceleration of bank branch closures has left many people who depend on them for essential banking services at risk of being cut adrift, which seems to fly in the face of work being done across the industry to protect access to cash,"" said Which? chief executive Anabel Hoult. Natalie Ceeney, who chairs the Access to Cash Action Group, which drew up the plans, said concentrating solely on keeping branches open was ""missing the point"", as they only served a small section of the community who were customers of that particular bank. ""Bank branches are closing at a high rate. The alternative [to these plans] is nothing. [Under this new agreement] if there is a gap left by a bank branch closure, it will be filled,"" she told the BBC. ""Banks will continue to make their own commercial decisions. We have been making sure no community is left behind."" She said that voluntary agreement would be made a legal requirement with legislation brought by government in the next 18 months. Martin McTague, from the Federation of Small Businesses, said: ""This new strategy will bring hope to communities which are losing bank branches and ATMs. ""It is important that the new assessments of need outlined today are independent and fair - we will be watching their progress closely."" The pandemic has cut cash use by 35%, but millions of people - often vulnerable - still rely on notes and coins. Another system which trials showed to be successful in certain venues was cashback from shop tills, without the need to make a purchase. During trials, half of withdrawals were for less than Â£20 and four in 10 were for non-round amounts - suggesting people were taking out relatively small amounts available in their bank accounts. Cash machines are not set up to provide such a bespoke service. Some2,000 shops are expected to offer the serviceby the end of the year.

"Boris Johnson takes questions in the Commons a day after he faced the biggest Tory rebellion of his premiership Last night nearly 100 Conservative MPs voted against the government's Plan B measures aimed at tackling Omicron The PM says he understands the anxieties of those who voted against him last night and says again the Plan B measures are balanced and proportionate Keir Starmer says the public has lost confidence in the PM after last night's rebellion and the row over Christmas parties In response, the PM accuses the opposition of playing politics and says he is delivering the fastest booster rollout in Europe Boris Johnson tells MPs they will have a say if further measures are needed to slow the spread of the Omicron variant Edited by Georgina Pattinson Weâre now bringing our live page coverage to an end â thanks for
joining us. During the final PMQs session of the year: Iain WatsonPolitical correspondent Quite often PMQs does not quite live up to the hype. Yesterdayâs rebellion, as a parliamentary occasion, was a
hard act to follow â and the result of tomorrowâs Shropshire by-election may be
a better guide to the mood on the Conservative benches than todayâs showdown at
Westminster. Even victory in the by-election may not be quite enough to
calm nerves â with one MP with his ear to the ground predicting a ""humiliating
hold"" - small majority, low turnout. Todayâs battle was fought for Labour on the territory of
leadership, where the ground has shifted in recent weeks in their favour. For the prime minster the focus was on delivery â he emphasised the
booster programmeâs progress here compared to  those in other countries, and this enabled him to recycle his ""we vaccinate, Labour
vaccilates"" line. There is, of course, no  shortage of hopefuls to
succeed the PM in the unlikely event that he took Sir Keir Starmerâs advice to ""look in the mirror"" - though, as one former cabinet minister pointed out
privately, the lack of one obvious successor could mean Boris Johnson
will remain in his refurbished No10 flat longer than the Opposition expects. And as the Omicron variant continues to run rife, votersâ attention might increasingly turn to what the
government is doing to respond, rather than obsessing over who is leading that
response. There will be a Downing Street press
conference at 1700 GMT led by the prime minister. He will be accompanied by England's Chief Medical Office Professor Chris
Whitty, and Dr Nikki Kanani, the medical
director of primary care for NHS England. During his questions, Keir Starmer said the prime minister should ""look in the mirror and ask himself whether he has the trust and authority to lead this country?"" We can assume the Labour leader meant an actual mirror, but a journalist for one newspaper suggested it could mean something else. Allow Twitter content?

Pippa Crerar - the Mirror's political editor - has been responsible for breaking many of the stories surrounding Christmas events that took place last year. Laura KuenssbergPolitical editor It was a no-brainer for the Labour party to go on the Conservative
rebellion today. However much the prime minister tried to dismiss it as
partisan trivia, it is a serious moment for any government see a rebellion of
that size, especially after a personal appeal from the prime minister. It doesnât mean the prime minister wonât ever be able to win
another vote on Covid, but there is no question it is a real dent to his authority. Meanwhile, Labour are trying to convey quite a nuanced message
- they potentially have to be quite careful with how they pitch it. We know it has
been tricky for them throughout the pandemic to find the right tone. They are wanting to be seen do the right thing for public health
but not wanting to be seen to be helping out the government. Reality Check The prime minister claimed that
there are â500,000 more jobs today than we had when the pandemic began"". According
toanalysis,externalpublished yesterday by the Office for
National Statistics (ONS), November saw the number of payrolled employees in
the UK rise by 424,000 since the start of the pandemic. The
figures reflect a recovery in the number of people in part-time jobs, which had
collapsed during successive lockdowns but now stands at just over 8 million. The resurgence in part-time work helped the unemployment rate fall to 4.2%. But
the ONS figures predate the arrival of the Omicron variant, which some fear may
lead to greater restrictions in some sectors. Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat, who chairs the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee, says he has received reports that Foreign Office staff numbers are about to be cut by ""10% across the board"". He asks how this could be compatible with the government's ""Global Britain"" ambitions. Boris Johnson says he has been assured by the foreign secretary that the report is ""fake news"", and adds that the UK is ""investing massively in overseas aid"". Labour MP Kate Hollern says that in his televised address on Sunday, the PM said every eligible adult would have the chance to get the jab by the end of the year. But she says the health secretary and health leaders have since said otherwise. She says the infrastructure to deliver on the target wasn't there and asks if there it is ""going to be another broken promise?"" Boris Johnson says delivering the booster programme will take a ""massive effort"" and be ""incredibly hard to achieve"". ""But do I believe our NHS and volunteers can do it? Yes I do."" Iain WatsonPolitical correspondent Itâs panto season and perhaps the most bizarre exchange at
PMQs was the claim by the PM that he won the Covid pass regulation yesterday on
Tory votes, with Sir Keir Stramer saying ""oh no, he didnât"" - and suggesting the PM was ""socially distanced from the
truth"". So what is the truth? Well, had Labour MPs sat on their
hands and abstained then 225 Conservative backed the Covid pass in England, and
126 MPs (not all Conservaive) voted against so in that sense the measure would
have gone through on Conservative votes. But had Labour voted against the measures, then Boris
Johnson would have been defeated. That said, some Conservatives might not have rebelled if
there had been a genuine prospect of defeating their own government. Knowing Labour would back the restrictions, they could
afford to put down a marker, and register a protest. So sometimes the truth has an elusive quality. That said, the bald facts are the PM suffered the biggest
rebellion of his premiership by a long chalk. Conservative Sir Bernard Jenkin says Russia is conducting a hybrid war against the West and asks what the government is doing about it. Boris Johnson says he told President Putin that if he were ""so rashly mad"" as to invade Ukraine, it would result in ""an extremely tough package of economic sanctions"". He adds that there would also be support for Ukraine and ""inevitably"" a build up of Nato forces in the nearby regions. Labour's Maria Eagle accuses Boris Johnson of ""repeatedly blocking"" her backbench bill to set up a public advocate to support relatives of people who die during major disasters, in the wake of the inquests into the Hillsborough stadium tragedy. Noting that the PM promised to set up such a position in his 2019 election manifesto, she asks whether this is ""another broken promise"" from Boris Johnson. The prime minister says the government recognises the importance of putting bereaved families ""at the heart"" of public inquests. He says funding for representation is available ""in certain circumstances"" and adds ministers are ""considering what steps should be taken"" in this area. Reality Check The
prime minister said at PMQs today: âWe won that vote last night with
Conservative votes."" But
the Labour leader Keir Starmer disputed that, saying: ""Without Labour
votes last night vital public health measures would not have got through."" They
are talking about last nightâs votes on plan B measures including on
mask-wearing and Covid passes. The
closest vote was the one on mandatory Covid passes, whichwent through by 368 votes to 126, with 100 Conservatives voting against the measure,external. If
the 142 Labour MPs who voted in favour of the measures had instead abstained
(not cast a vote) the motion would still have passed. But
if they had voted against it, it would have been defeated by 268 to 225. (While
the numbers are clear, the political calculations are more difficult to make, because
many Tory MPs may have felt safe rebelling knowing that the government's motion would be carried by Labour MPs.) The SNP's Stephen Flynn asks if ""the damage being caused by Brexit, a litany of broken promises, the condoning of Conservative party corruption or his complicity in lockdown-busting Christmas party quizzes has led to the public so dramatically and so rapidly losing faith in his leadership"". Boris Johnson replies that ""freedom from the European Union enabled us to deliver fastest vaccine roll-out in Europe and enabled us to have fastest economic growth in the G7"". Iain WatsonPolitical correspondent Keir Starmer didnât call for Boris Johnsonâs resignation. But he did urge him to fall on his sword. He invited him to look in the mirror and decide
whether he had the authority to lead. The Labour leader is using Boris Johnsonâs difficulties with
his own MPs to build up his own leadership credentials - something he has struggled to do during the pandemic. He is hoping that polling suggesting diminishing trust in
the prime minister will also equate to greater trust in the Opposition. But Sir Keir did not stick entirely to the image of  a
statesman, attacking the alleged rule breaking in Downing Street. His cover for this was that the public may be less willing
to follow rules if the PM doesnât do the same. This allowed Boris Johnson to attack the Opposition leader
for playing politics. But in doing so, there may be a hostage to fortune when he
dismissed allegations of rule breaking as ""partisan trivia"" when Labour believes this is of concern to target voters,
and before the cabinet secretary has set out the facts. The SDLP's Colum Eastwood also picks up on the parties row, accusing the PM of ""ignoring rule breaking"" in Downing Street last Christmas. He goes further than Keir Starmer and says the PM should resign, for ""eroding public confidence"" in Covid policies. Boris Johnson rejects this, saying he will be leading the government's efforts to help people ""get though this pandemic together"". The SNP leader in Westminster Ian Blackford says the Conservatives ""might be privileged enough to live in denial"" of the Omicron variant ""but the rest of us have a responsibility to live in the real world"". He asks Boris Johnson if he will be offering more money to help Scottish businesses hit by the rise in Covid cases. Boris Johnson replies that the Scottish government has the power to raise money if it chooses. Noting the big rebellion of Conservative MPs on new Covid rules, Blackford says: ""A prime minister who can't do what is needed to protect the public is no prime minister at all. ""If the PM can't act, will he give the devolved government the powers we need to protect our people,"" he asks. ""We are going to need a bigger waistcoat to contain the synthetic indignation of the MP,"" Johnson replies. He says Scotland has had a ""record settlement"" of Â£41bn but adds that he is working with the Scottish government ""to make sure we get through this thing together"". Reusing an attack line he used over the weekend, Keir Starmer says Boris Johnson is the âworst possible prime minister at the worst possible time"" and ""too weak to lead"". He asks whether this Christmas, the prime minister will ""look in the mirror"" and ask himself whether, after last night's rebellion, he still has the ""trust and the authority"" to lead the country. In response, Boris Johnson falls back on a familiar defence - and points out that Labour opposed the government's easing of restrictions last summer, and accuses the party of ""playing politics"". He also uses another phrase he has repeatedly used at PMQs to attack Labour, telling MPs: ""they vacillate, we vaccinate"". Keir Starmer says the PM has claimed ""for weeks that no rules were broken"" last year. ""I don't believe him, his MPs don't believe him, nor do the British public - he is taking the public for fools and it is becoming dangerous."" He says the PM has ""no hope of regaining the moral authority to deliver difficult messages"" amid further Covid restrictions ""if he cannot be straight with the public about the rule-breaking in Downing Street last Christmas"". Boris Johnson says he has ordered an inquiry into ""what went on last year"" adding that the Labour leader should explain ""why there are pictures of him quaffing beer"". He says the British public want politicians to ""focus on the matter in hand"". (The Sun newspaper had apicture of the Labour leader having a beer with party workers in May,external; Labour dismissed the claim, the paper reported.) Referencing the row over gatherings in Downing Street at the height of Covid restrictions last year, Keir Starmer says Boris Johnson has been ""undermining public confidence"". Quoting remarks made by several Tory MPs, he asks how people can be expected to follow his instructions when it comes to new measures for Omicron. The prime minister says the answer is there in ""what the public is doing"". He says he thinks the public is ""focused on"" the government's vaccine booster campaign, and calls the row over parties last year ""partisan trivia"". Keir Starmer says Labour showed the leadership that the PM lacked and adds that if it wasn't for Labour votes, his government wouldn't have been able to introduce vital health measures. The Labour leader says he can understand why Conservative MPs ""no longer trust"" their leader. He says in the summer the government promised that restriction relaxations would be irreversible. ""Like the rail revolution for the North, like 'no one will have to sell their homes for social care', just like no tax rises"" - Starmer says the PM ""over-promises until reality catches up"". Boris Johnson accuses the Labour leader of ""playing politics"". He argues that the government has rolled out a fast booster programme and created one of the fastest growing economies in the G7.

"More restrictions could be introduced before Christmas in response to the new Omicron variant, Scotland's deputy first minister has said. John Swinney also urged people to take ""the greatest of care"" over household mixing. On Tuesday people were asked to limit socialising to three households at a time in the run-up to the festive period. But Nicola Sturgeon said the advice would not apply on Christmas Day. Shops and hospitality venues will also be told to bring back physical distancing and screens. It came as the number of confirmed Omicron cases in Scotland increased by almost 90% in just 24 hours. A total of 592 people were confirmed with the new variant on Wednesday, up from 296 on the previous day. Scots urged to limit socialising to three households Jabs need a major scaling up - but can it be done? Respiratory health expert Prof James Chalmers predicted further restrictions could be imminent as experts learn more about the new variant. The Scottish Conservatives said the restrictions were a measured response to last week'sOmicron evidence paper,externalwhich painted a ""scary and bleak picture"". Asked on BBC Radio'sGood Morning Scotlandprogramme if there could be another change to the rules before Christmas, Mr Swinney said: ""Potentially that would be the case but we obviously want to avoid that. ""We hope that we have done enough in the announcements that were made yesterday and we hope that members of the public and businesses will work with us in a cooperative spirit to make sure that we can take these provision forward."" Mr Swinney said he was ""optimistic"" enough was being done for now but cautioned that the percentage of Omicron cases in Scotland had soared from 2% about 10 days ago to more than 27%. ""We have a variant that is very powerful, that is growing at an alarming rate, and we face a very severe situation,"" he added. At Holyrood, Ms Sturgeon said she would have tightened hospitality rules further if she had financial support from the UK Treasury. Asked about this, Mr Swinney said they would have liked to extend physical distancing guidance and limit capacities at certain venues. The deputy first minister also said he expected the new measures to extend into the new year. Mr Swinney added people do not have to cancel their plans to attend mass events, such as a panto or a football match, but urged them to ensure they are fully vaccinated and to take a lateral flow test before they attend. Scotland aims to offer a booster shot to everyone over the age of 18 by the end of the month Scottish Conservative health spokesman Dr Sandesh Gulhane said Omicron was ""spreading like wildfire through our communities"". He said the new guidance was ""measured and what we need at the moment"" but further restrictions should not be ruled out as long as there is government support for businesses. The practising GP also described boosters as ""the way out of this"" and called for more drop-in vaccination facilities. Meanwhile, Prof Chalmers of Dundee University said the new variant has a rate of infection of 50% - one person with the virus in a room of 100 could infect 50 people. But he said the full picture of the threat it posed was not yet clear. ""I think the government needs to be ready next week, as we get more data on the vaccine protection against severe disease and other gaps that currently need to be filled in terms of our knowledge, to think about what other measures may be required,"" he said. ""If this is as bad as we think it is going to be there may still be other measures required over the Christmas and new year period."" Why do boosters work if two doses struggle? What are the new Covid rules across the UK? Covid in Scotland: Where are the latest cases? Meanwhile, the Scottish Grocers Federation told the programme it was ""the worst time of year"" for its members to introduce a queuing system. And Stephen O'Regan, who runs three Kitty of Shea's bars in Glasgow and Edinburgh, admitted he ""felt sick"" when he heard the first minister's update. The chain is already up to 60% down on bookings and fear some stock, such as the 300 kegs of Guinness ordered for December alone, may go unopened. The lack of detail from the government about the restrictions was ""frightening"", he added. Ms Sturgeon last week said that Scotland was facing a ""likely tsunami"" of new infections of Covid-19 in the weeks ahead, with a ""very significant"" impact on health services. In response, work is under way to ensure all eligible adults receive their booster vaccination by the end of the year. And guidelines limiting socialising to three adults and measures to cut down crowding in shops and bars were announced on Tuesday. However, schools are to remain open, with Ms Sturgeon saying it was a ""key aim to ensure that schools stay open if at all possible to minimise further disruption to education"".

"Boris Johnson takes questions in the Commons a day after he faced the biggest Tory rebellion of his premiership Last night nearly 100 Conservative MPs voted against the government's Plan B measures aimed at tackling Omicron The PM says he understands the anxieties of those who voted against him last night and says again the Plan B measures are balanced and proportionate Keir Starmer says the public has lost confidence in the PM after last night's rebellion and the row over Christmas parties In response, the PM accuses the opposition of playing politics and says he is delivering the fastest booster rollout in Europe Boris Johnson tells MPs they will have a say if further measures are needed to slow the spread of the Omicron variant Edited by Georgina Pattinson Weâre now bringing our live page coverage to an end â thanks for
joining us. During the final PMQs session of the year: Iain WatsonPolitical correspondent Quite often PMQs does not quite live up to the hype. Yesterdayâs rebellion, as a parliamentary occasion, was a
hard act to follow â and the result of tomorrowâs Shropshire by-election may be
a better guide to the mood on the Conservative benches than todayâs showdown at
Westminster. Even victory in the by-election may not be quite enough to
calm nerves â with one MP with his ear to the ground predicting a ""humiliating
hold"" - small majority, low turnout. Todayâs battle was fought for Labour on the territory of
leadership, where the ground has shifted in recent weeks in their favour. For the prime minster the focus was on delivery â he emphasised the
booster programmeâs progress here compared to  those in other countries, and this enabled him to recycle his ""we vaccinate, Labour
vaccilates"" line. There is, of course, no  shortage of hopefuls to
succeed the PM in the unlikely event that he took Sir Keir Starmerâs advice to ""look in the mirror"" - though, as one former cabinet minister pointed out
privately, the lack of one obvious successor could mean Boris Johnson
will remain in his refurbished No10 flat longer than the Opposition expects. And as the Omicron variant continues to run rife, votersâ attention might increasingly turn to what the
government is doing to respond, rather than obsessing over who is leading that
response. There will be a Downing Street press
conference at 1700 GMT led by the prime minister. He will be accompanied by England's Chief Medical Office Professor Chris
Whitty, and Dr Nikki Kanani, the medical
director of primary care for NHS England. During his questions, Keir Starmer said the prime minister should ""look in the mirror and ask himself whether he has the trust and authority to lead this country?""

Pippa Crerar - the Mirror's political editor - has been responsible for breaking many of the stories surrounding Christmas events that took place last year. Laura KuenssbergPolitical editor It was a no-brainer for the Labour party to go on the Conservative
rebellion today. However much the prime minister tried to dismiss it as
partisan trivia, it is a serious moment for any government see a rebellion of
that size, especially after a personal appeal from the prime minister. It doesnât mean the prime minister wonât ever be able to win
another vote on Covid, but there is no question it is a real dent to his authority. Meanwhile, Labour are trying to convey quite a nuanced message
- they potentially have to be quite careful with how they pitch it. We know it has
been tricky for them throughout the pandemic to find the right tone. They are wanting to be seen do the right thing for public health
but not wanting to be seen to be helping out the government. Reality Check The prime minister claimed that
there are â500,000 more jobs today than we had when the pandemic began"". According
toanalysis,externalpublished yesterday by the Office for
National Statistics (ONS), November saw the number of payrolled employees in
the UK rise by 424,000 since the start of the pandemic. The
figures reflect a recovery in the number of people in part-time jobs, which had
collapsed during successive lockdowns but now stands at just over 8 million. The resurgence in part-time work helped the unemployment rate fall to 4.2%. But
the ONS figures predate the arrival of the Omicron variant, which some fear may
lead to greater restrictions in some sectors. Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat, who chairs the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee, says he has received reports that Foreign Office staff numbers are about to be cut by ""10% across the board"". He asks how this could be compatible with the government's ""Global Britain"" ambitions. Boris Johnson says he has been assured by the foreign secretary that the report is ""fake news"", and adds that the UK is ""investing massively in overseas aid"". Labour MP Kate Hollern says that in his televised address on Sunday, the PM said every eligible adult would have the chance to get the jab by the end of the year. But she says the health secretary and health leaders have since said otherwise. She says the infrastructure to deliver on the target wasn't there and asks if there it is ""going to be another broken promise?"" Boris Johnson says delivering the booster programme will take a ""massive effort"" and be ""incredibly hard to achieve"". ""But do I believe our NHS and volunteers can do it? Yes I do."" Iain WatsonPolitical correspondent Itâs panto season and perhaps the most bizarre exchange at
PMQs was the claim by the PM that he won the Covid pass regulation yesterday on
Tory votes, with Sir Keir Stramer saying ""oh no, he didnât"" - and suggesting the PM was ""socially distanced from the
truth"". So what is the truth? Well, had Labour MPs sat on their
hands and abstained then 225 Conservative backed the Covid pass in England, and
126 MPs (not all Conservaive) voted against so in that sense the measure would
have gone through on Conservative votes. But had Labour voted against the measures, then Boris
Johnson would have been defeated. That said, some Conservatives might not have rebelled if
there had been a genuine prospect of defeating their own government. Knowing Labour would back the restrictions, they could
afford to put down a marker, and register a protest. So sometimes the truth has an elusive quality. That said, the bald facts are the PM suffered the biggest
rebellion of his premiership by a long chalk. Conservative Sir Bernard Jenkin says Russia is conducting a hybrid war against the West and asks what the government is doing about it. Boris Johnson says he told President Putin that if he were ""so rashly mad"" as to invade Ukraine, it would result in ""an extremely tough package of economic sanctions"". He adds that there would also be support for Ukraine and ""inevitably"" a build up of Nato forces in the nearby regions. Labour's Maria Eagle accuses Boris Johnson of ""repeatedly blocking"" her backbench bill to set up a public advocate to support relatives of people who die during major disasters, in the wake of the inquests into the Hillsborough stadium tragedy. Noting that the PM promised to set up such a position in his 2019 election manifesto, she asks whether this is ""another broken promise"" from Boris Johnson. The prime minister says the government recognises the importance of putting bereaved families ""at the heart"" of public inquests. He says funding for representation is available ""in certain circumstances"" and adds ministers are ""considering what steps should be taken"" in this area. Reality Check The
prime minister said at PMQs today: âWe won that vote last night with
Conservative votes."" But
the Labour leader Keir Starmer disputed that, saying: ""Without Labour
votes last night vital public health measures would not have got through."" They
are talking about last nightâs votes on plan B measures including on
mask-wearing and Covid passes. The
closest vote was the one on mandatory Covid passes, whichwent through by 368 votes to 126, with 100 Conservatives voting against the measure,external. If
the 142 Labour MPs who voted in favour of the measures had instead abstained
(not cast a vote) the motion would still have passed. But
if they had voted against it, it would have been defeated by 268 to 225. (While
the numbers are clear, the political calculations are more difficult to make, because
many Tory MPs may have felt safe rebelling knowing that the government's motion would be carried by Labour MPs.) The SNP's Stephen Flynn asks if ""the damage being caused by Brexit, a litany of broken promises, the condoning of Conservative party corruption or his complicity in lockdown-busting Christmas party quizzes has led to the public so dramatically and so rapidly losing faith in his leadership"". Boris Johnson replies that ""freedom from the European Union enabled us to deliver fastest vaccine roll-out in Europe and enabled us to have fastest economic growth in the G7"".

director of primary care for NHS England.

Pippa Crerar - the Mirror's political editor - has been responsible for breaking many of the stories surrounding Christmas events that took place last year. Laura KuenssbergPolitical editor It was a no-brainer for the Labour party to go on the Conservative
rebellion today. However much the prime minister tried to dismiss it as
partisan trivia, it is a serious moment for any government see a rebellion of
that size, especially after a personal appeal from the prime minister. It doesnât mean the prime minister wonât ever be able to win
another vote on Covid, but there is no question it is a real dent to his authority. Meanwhile, Labour are trying to convey quite a nuanced message
- they potentially have to be quite careful with how they pitch it. We know it has
been tricky for them throughout the pandemic to find the right tone. They are wanting to be seen do the right thing for public health
but not wanting to be seen to be helping out the government. Reality Check The prime minister claimed that
there are â500,000 more jobs today than we had when the pandemic began"". According
toanalysis,externalpublished yesterday by the Office for
National Statistics (ONS), November saw the number of payrolled employees in
the UK rise by 424,000 since the start of the pandemic. The
figures reflect a recovery in the number of people in part-time jobs, which had
collapsed during successive lockdowns but now stands at just over 8 million. The resurgence in part-time work helped the unemployment rate fall to 4.2%. But
the ONS figures predate the arrival of the Omicron variant, which some fear may
lead to greater restrictions in some sectors. Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat, who chairs the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee, says he has received reports that Foreign Office staff numbers are about to be cut by ""10% across the board"". He asks how this could be compatible with the government's ""Global Britain"" ambitions. Boris Johnson says he has been assured by the foreign secretary that the report is ""fake news"", and adds that the UK is ""investing massively in overseas aid"". Labour MP Kate Hollern says that in his televised address on Sunday, the PM said every eligible adult would have the chance to get the jab by the end of the year. But she says the health secretary and health leaders have since said otherwise. She says the infrastructure to deliver on the target wasn't there and asks if there it is ""going to be another broken promise?"" Boris Johnson says delivering the booster programme will take a ""massive effort"" and be ""incredibly hard to achieve"". ""But do I believe our NHS and volunteers can do it? Yes I do."" Iain WatsonPolitical correspondent Itâs panto season and perhaps the most bizarre exchange at
PMQs was the claim by the PM that he won the Covid pass regulation yesterday on
Tory votes, with Sir Keir Stramer saying ""oh no, he didnât"" - and suggesting the PM was ""socially distanced from the
truth"". So what is the truth? Well, had Labour MPs sat on their
hands and abstained then 225 Conservative backed the Covid pass in England, and
126 MPs (not all Conservaive) voted against so in that sense the measure would
have gone through on Conservative votes. But had Labour voted against the measures, then Boris
Johnson would have been defeated. That said, some Conservatives might not have rebelled if
there had been a genuine prospect of defeating their own government. Knowing Labour would back the restrictions, they could
afford to put down a marker, and register a protest. So sometimes the truth has an elusive quality. That said, the bald facts are the PM suffered the biggest
rebellion of his premiership by a long chalk. Conservative Sir Bernard Jenkin says Russia is conducting a hybrid war against the West and asks what the government is doing about it. Boris Johnson says he told President Putin that if he were ""so rashly mad"" as to invade Ukraine, it would result in ""an extremely tough package of economic sanctions"". He adds that there would also be support for Ukraine and ""inevitably"" a build up of Nato forces in the nearby regions. Labour's Maria Eagle accuses Boris Johnson of ""repeatedly blocking"" her backbench bill to set up a public advocate to support relatives of people who die during major disasters, in the wake of the inquests into the Hillsborough stadium tragedy. Noting that the PM promised to set up such a position in his 2019 election manifesto, she asks whether this is ""another broken promise"" from Boris Johnson. The prime minister says the government recognises the importance of putting bereaved families ""at the heart"" of public inquests. He says funding for representation is available ""in certain circumstances"" and adds ministers are ""considering what steps should be taken"" in this area. Reality Check The
prime minister said at PMQs today: âWe won that vote last night with
Conservative votes."" But
the Labour leader Keir Starmer disputed that, saying: ""Without Labour
votes last night vital public health measures would not have got through."" They
are talking about last nightâs votes on plan B measures including on
mask-wearing and Covid passes. The
closest vote was the one on mandatory Covid passes, whichwent through by 368 votes to 126, with 100 Conservatives voting against the measure,external. If
the 142 Labour MPs who voted in favour of the measures had instead abstained
(not cast a vote) the motion would still have passed. But
if they had voted against it, it would have been defeated by 268 to 225. (While
the numbers are clear, the political calculations are more difficult to make, because
many Tory MPs may have felt safe rebelling knowing that the government's motion would be carried by Labour MPs.) The SNP's Stephen Flynn asks if ""the damage being caused by Brexit, a litany of broken promises, the condoning of Conservative party corruption or his complicity in lockdown-busting Christmas party quizzes has led to the public so dramatically and so rapidly losing faith in his leadership"". Boris Johnson replies that ""freedom from the European Union enabled us to deliver fastest vaccine roll-out in Europe and enabled us to have fastest economic growth in the G7"". Iain WatsonPolitical correspondent Keir Starmer didnât call for Boris Johnsonâs resignation. But he did urge him to fall on his sword. He invited him to look in the mirror and decide
whether he had the authority to lead. The Labour leader is using Boris Johnsonâs difficulties with
his own MPs to build up his own leadership credentials - something he has struggled to do during the pandemic. He is hoping that polling suggesting diminishing trust in
the prime minister will also equate to greater trust in the Opposition. But Sir Keir did not stick entirely to the image of  a
statesman, attacking the alleged rule breaking in Downing Street. His cover for this was that the public may be less willing
to follow rules if the PM doesnât do the same. This allowed Boris Johnson to attack the Opposition leader
for playing politics. But in doing so, there may be a hostage to fortune when he
dismissed allegations of rule breaking as ""partisan trivia"" when Labour believes this is of concern to target voters,
and before the cabinet secretary has set out the facts. The SDLP's Colum Eastwood also picks up on the parties row, accusing the PM of ""ignoring rule breaking"" in Downing Street last Christmas. He goes further than Keir Starmer and says the PM should resign, for ""eroding public confidence"" in Covid policies. Boris Johnson rejects this, saying he will be leading the government's efforts to help people ""get though this pandemic together"". The SNP leader in Westminster Ian Blackford says the Conservatives ""might be privileged enough to live in denial"" of the Omicron variant ""but the rest of us have a responsibility to live in the real world"". He asks Boris Johnson if he will be offering more money to help Scottish businesses hit by the rise in Covid cases. Boris Johnson replies that the Scottish government has the power to raise money if it chooses. Noting the big rebellion of Conservative MPs on new Covid rules, Blackford says: ""A prime minister who can't do what is needed to protect the public is no prime minister at all. ""If the PM can't act, will he give the devolved government the powers we need to protect our people,"" he asks. ""We are going to need a bigger waistcoat to contain the synthetic indignation of the MP,"" Johnson replies. He says Scotland has had a ""record settlement"" of Â£41bn but adds that he is working with the Scottish government ""to make sure we get through this thing together"". Reusing an attack line he used over the weekend, Keir Starmer says Boris Johnson is the âworst possible prime minister at the worst possible time"" and ""too weak to lead"". He asks whether this Christmas, the prime minister will ""look in the mirror"" and ask himself whether, after last night's rebellion, he still has the ""trust and the authority"" to lead the country. In response, Boris Johnson falls back on a familiar defence - and points out that Labour opposed the government's easing of restrictions last summer, and accuses the party of ""playing politics"". He also uses another phrase he has repeatedly used at PMQs to attack Labour, telling MPs: ""they vacillate, we vaccinate"". Keir Starmer says the PM has claimed ""for weeks that no rules were broken"" last year. ""I don't believe him, his MPs don't believe him, nor do the British public - he is taking the public for fools and it is becoming dangerous."" He says the PM has ""no hope of regaining the moral authority to deliver difficult messages"" amid further Covid restrictions ""if he cannot be straight with the public about the rule-breaking in Downing Street last Christmas"". Boris Johnson says he has ordered an inquiry into ""what went on last year"" adding that the Labour leader should explain ""why there are pictures of him quaffing beer"". He says the British public want politicians to ""focus on the matter in hand"". (The Sun newspaper had apicture of the Labour leader having a beer with party workers in May,external; Labour dismissed the claim, the paper reported.) Referencing the row over gatherings in Downing Street at the height of Covid restrictions last year, Keir Starmer says Boris Johnson has been ""undermining public confidence"". Quoting remarks made by several Tory MPs, he asks how people can be expected to follow his instructions when it comes to new measures for Omicron. The prime minister says the answer is there in ""what the public is doing"". He says he thinks the public is ""focused on"" the government's vaccine booster campaign, and calls the row over parties last year ""partisan trivia"". Keir Starmer says Labour showed the leadership that the PM lacked and adds that if it wasn't for Labour votes, his government wouldn't have been able to introduce vital health measures. The Labour leader says he can understand why Conservative MPs ""no longer trust"" their leader. He says in the summer the government promised that restriction relaxations would be irreversible. ""Like the rail revolution for the North, like 'no one will have to sell their homes for social care', just like no tax rises"" - Starmer says the PM ""over-promises until reality catches up"". Boris Johnson accuses the Labour leader of ""playing politics"". He argues that the government has rolled out a fast booster programme and created one of the fastest growing economies in the G7.

"Boris Johnson takes questions in the Commons a day after he faced the biggest Tory rebellion of his premiership Last night nearly 100 Conservative MPs voted against the government's Plan B measures aimed at tackling Omicron The PM says he understands the anxieties of those who voted against him last night and says again the Plan B measures are balanced and proportionate Keir Starmer says the public has lost confidence in the PM after last night's rebellion and the row over Christmas parties In response, the PM accuses the opposition of playing politics and says he is delivering the fastest booster rollout in Europe Boris Johnson tells MPs they will have a say if further measures are needed to slow the spread of the Omicron variant Edited by Georgina Pattinson Weâre now bringing our live page coverage to an end â thanks for
joining us. During the final PMQs session of the year: Iain WatsonPolitical correspondent Quite often PMQs does not quite live up to the hype. Yesterdayâs rebellion, as a parliamentary occasion, was a
hard act to follow â and the result of tomorrowâs Shropshire by-election may be
a better guide to the mood on the Conservative benches than todayâs showdown at
Westminster. Even victory in the by-election may not be quite enough to
calm nerves â with one MP with his ear to the ground predicting a ""humiliating
hold"" - small majority, low turnout. Todayâs battle was fought for Labour on the territory of
leadership, where the ground has shifted in recent weeks in their favour. For the prime minster the focus was on delivery â he emphasised the
booster programmeâs progress here compared to  those in other countries, and this enabled him to recycle his ""we vaccinate, Labour
vaccilates"" line. There is, of course, no  shortage of hopefuls to
succeed the PM in the unlikely event that he took Sir Keir Starmerâs advice to ""look in the mirror"" - though, as one former cabinet minister pointed out
privately, the lack of one obvious successor could mean Boris Johnson
will remain in his refurbished No10 flat longer than the Opposition expects. And as the Omicron variant continues to run rife, votersâ attention might increasingly turn to what the
government is doing to respond, rather than obsessing over who is leading that
response. There will be a Downing Street press
conference at 1700 GMT led by the prime minister. He will be accompanied by England's Chief Medical Office Professor Chris

"This video can not be played Watch: The moment MPs approved the introduction of a Covid pass in England Adults in England must now show a Covid pass to enter nightclubs, big sports matches and other large events - despite 100 Conservative MPs voting against the government's plans. The new rules - which kick in today - require proof of double-vaccination, or a recent negative test, to enter certain venues. MPs approved the measure in Tuesday's vote on England's new Covid rules. Despite the revolt by Tory MPs, the plans passed thanks to Labour support. The changes come as Dr Jenny Harries, chief executive of the UK Health Security Agency, said growth of the Omicron variant over the coming days would be ""staggering"", with infections currently doubling in less than two days in most UK regions. She told a committee of MPs the new variant was ""probably the most significant threat we've had since the start of the pandemic"". Where will I need to use a Covid passport? What do I need to watch sport? Johnson's biggest rebellion - and why it matters The Commons also backed - with smaller Conservative rebellions - the continuation of mandatory mask-wearing in most indoor settings, and compulsory vaccination for NHS workers in England. The scrapping of self-isolation for fully vaccinated Covid contacts - in favour of daily lateral flow tests - passed unanimously without a vote. The rebellion on Covid passes was by far the biggest since Boris Johnson took office. At Prime Minister's Questions, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said Mr Johnson was ""too weak to lead"" and suggested that, after the rebellion, he hadlost the ""trust and the authority"" to govern the country. Mr Johnson said the government was taking a ""balanced and proportionate"" approach to Covid regulations and accused Labour of ""playing political games"". Earlier, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps told BBC Breakfast he hoped there would be no need for further Covid measures. ""We've got in place now the measures that we believe will see us through to the new year,"" he said. If there did turn out to be a need for additional restrictions, he was ""certain"" Parliament would be recalled, Mr Shapps said. Over-18s in England must prove they are double vaccinated,externalagainst Covid-19, had a negative PCR or lateral flow test result within the last 48 hours, or have an exemption, to enter large events and venues You can get a pass digitally on theNHS app,externalor theNHS website,external. You can alsorequest a letter,externalfrom the NHS to confirm your vaccine status, or show test results with a text message or email from NHS Test and Trace Passes based on test results expire after 48 hours, while vaccine passes need to be renewed in the app or on the website after 30 days The rules apply to nightclubs, indoor unseated venues with more than 500 people, unseated outdoor venues with more than 4,000 people, and any venue with more than 10,000 people Covid passport schemes are already in operation in Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales One Tory rebel, Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, said the scale of the revolt meant a leadership challenge to Mr Johnson had ""got to be on the cards"" next year. And former Tory chief whip, Mark Harper MP, said: ""You either listen and you respond and you do things differently - or you ignore what you have been told and you plough on regardless, and then this will happen over and over again."" But former cabinet minister Damian Green, who also rebelled, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that for him it was ""absolutely not"" a vote demonstrating a lack of confidence in Boris Johnson, adding that he would vote for tougher measures if he believed they would be effective. The spread of the Omicron variant has prompted long queues for booster vaccinations and pressures on supplies lateral flow and PCR tests, although the government insists it has enough stockpiled. West End shows havescrapped performances due to outbreaks,Premier League matches have been postponedand pubs and restaurants reporta wave of Christmas bookings being cancelled. Boris Johnson didn't lose. But no prime minister wants to feel they're losing the argument in much of their own party. And the scale of the rebellion is even worse than predicted. Not just a slap on the wrist for Mr Johnson, but a very serious rejection of his plan. Something that can't be dismissed, despite his own personal appeals to his ranks. Read more from Laurahere Prof Graham Medley from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine told BBC Radio 4's Today programme there was a ""very real possibility"" of the NHS being overwhelmed if Omicron infections spread to older age groups, as experience suggested they would. Although vaccination and immunity through prior infections are higher now, reducing the risk to many individuals, the numbers in hospital could still get ""very large"", perhaps up to 2,000 a day, he suggested. On Tuesday, the UK recorded 59,610 new Covid cases, the highest number since January, along with 150 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test. The UK Health Security Agency said633 further UK Omicron cases were reported on Tuesday, taking the total number of confirmed cases of the variant to 5,346.,externalBut the agency's modelling suggests the real figure may be much higher. Meanwhile, a total of 513,722 booster and third doses were given across the UK on Monday. InScotland have been urged to limit socialising to three householdsat a time, with shops and hospitality venues to be told to reinstate physical distancing and protective screens.

The scrapping of self-isolation for fully vaccinated Covid contacts - in favour of daily lateral flow tests - passed unanimously without a vote. The rebellion on Covid passes was by far the biggest since Boris Johnson took office. At Prime Minister's Questions, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said Mr Johnson was ""too weak to lead"" and suggested that, after the rebellion, he hadlost the ""trust and the authority"" to govern the country. Mr Johnson said the government was taking a ""balanced and proportionate"" approach to Covid regulations and accused Labour of ""playing political games"". Earlier, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps told BBC Breakfast he hoped there would be no need for further Covid measures. ""We've got in place now the measures that we believe will see us through to the new year,"" he said. If there did turn out to be a need for additional restrictions, he was ""certain"" Parliament would be recalled, Mr Shapps said. Over-18s in England must prove they are double vaccinated,externalagainst Covid-19, had a negative PCR or lateral flow test result within the last 48 hours, or have an exemption, to enter large events and venues You can get a pass digitally on theNHS app,externalor theNHS website,external. You can alsorequest a letter,externalfrom the NHS to confirm your vaccine status, or show test results with a text message or email from NHS Test and Trace Passes based on test results expire after 48 hours, while vaccine passes need to be renewed in the app or on the website after 30 days The rules apply to nightclubs, indoor unseated venues with more than 500 people, unseated outdoor venues with more than 4,000 people, and any venue with more than 10,000 people Covid passport schemes are already in operation in Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales One Tory rebel, Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, said the scale of the revolt meant a leadership challenge to Mr Johnson had ""got to be on the cards"" next year. And former Tory chief whip, Mark Harper MP, said: ""You either listen and you respond and you do things differently - or you ignore what you have been told and you plough on regardless, and then this will happen over and over again."" But former cabinet minister Damian Green, who also rebelled, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that for him it was ""absolutely not"" a vote demonstrating a lack of confidence in Boris Johnson, adding that he would vote for tougher measures if he believed they would be effective. The spread of the Omicron variant has prompted long queues for booster vaccinations and pressures on supplies lateral flow and PCR tests, although the government insists it has enough stockpiled. West End shows havescrapped performances due to outbreaks,Premier League matches have been postponedand pubs and restaurants reporta wave of Christmas bookings being cancelled. Boris Johnson didn't lose. But no prime minister wants to feel they're losing the argument in much of their own party. And the scale of the rebellion is even worse than predicted. Not just a slap on the wrist for Mr Johnson, but a very serious rejection of his plan. Something that can't be dismissed, despite his own personal appeals to his ranks. Read more from Laurahere Prof Graham Medley from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine told BBC Radio 4's Today programme there was a ""very real possibility"" of the NHS being overwhelmed if Omicron infections spread to older age groups, as experience suggested they would. Although vaccination and immunity through prior infections are higher now, reducing the risk to many individuals, the numbers in hospital could still get ""very large"", perhaps up to 2,000 a day, he suggested. On Tuesday, the UK recorded 59,610 new Covid cases, the highest number since January, along with 150 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test. The UK Health Security Agency said633 further UK Omicron cases were reported on Tuesday, taking the total number of confirmed cases of the variant to 5,346.,externalBut the agency's modelling suggests the real figure may be much higher. Meanwhile, a total of 513,722 booster and third doses were given across the UK on Monday. InScotland have been urged to limit socialising to three householdsat a time, with shops and hospitality venues to be told to reinstate physical distancing and protective screens.

"Boris Johnson takes questions in the Commons a day after he faced the biggest Tory rebellion of his premiership Last night nearly 100 Conservative MPs voted against the government's Plan B measures aimed at tackling Omicron The PM says he understands the anxieties of those who voted against him last night and says again the Plan B measures are balanced and proportionate Keir Starmer says the public has lost confidence in the PM after last night's rebellion and the row over Christmas parties In response, the PM accuses the opposition of playing politics and says he is delivering the fastest booster rollout in Europe Boris Johnson tells MPs they will have a say if further measures are needed to slow the spread of the Omicron variant Edited by Georgina Pattinson Weâre now bringing our live page coverage to an end â thanks for
joining us. During the final PMQs session of the year: Iain WatsonPolitical correspondent Quite often PMQs does not quite live up to the hype. Yesterdayâs rebellion, as a parliamentary occasion, was a
hard act to follow â and the result of tomorrowâs Shropshire by-election may be
a better guide to the mood on the Conservative benches than todayâs showdown at
Westminster. Even victory in the by-election may not be quite enough to
calm nerves â with one MP with his ear to the ground predicting a ""humiliating
hold"" - small majority, low turnout. Todayâs battle was fought for Labour on the territory of
leadership, where the ground has shifted in recent weeks in their favour. For the prime minster the focus was on delivery â he emphasised the
booster programmeâs progress here compared to  those in other countries, and this enabled him to recycle his ""we vaccinate, Labour
vaccilates"" line. There is, of course, no  shortage of hopefuls to
succeed the PM in the unlikely event that he took Sir Keir Starmerâs advice to ""look in the mirror"" - though, as one former cabinet minister pointed out
privately, the lack of one obvious successor could mean Boris Johnson
will remain in his refurbished No10 flat longer than the Opposition expects. And as the Omicron variant continues to run rife, votersâ attention might increasingly turn to what the
government is doing to respond, rather than obsessing over who is leading that
response. There will be a Downing Street press
conference at 1700 GMT led by the prime minister. He will be accompanied by England's Chief Medical Office Professor Chris
Whitty, and Dr Nikki Kanani, the medical
director of primary care for NHS England. During his questions, Keir Starmer said the prime minister should ""look in the mirror and ask himself whether he has the trust and authority to lead this country?"" We can assume the Labour leader meant an actual mirror, but a journalist for one newspaper suggested it could mean something else. Allow Twitter content?

Pippa Crerar - the Mirror's political editor - has been responsible for breaking many of the stories surrounding Christmas events that took place last year. Laura KuenssbergPolitical editor It was a no-brainer for the Labour party to go on the Conservative
rebellion today. However much the prime minister tried to dismiss it as
partisan trivia, it is a serious moment for any government see a rebellion of
that size, especially after a personal appeal from the prime minister. It doesnât mean the prime minister wonât ever be able to win
another vote on Covid, but there is no question it is a real dent to his authority. Meanwhile, Labour are trying to convey quite a nuanced message
- they potentially have to be quite careful with how they pitch it. We know it has
been tricky for them throughout the pandemic to find the right tone. They are wanting to be seen do the right thing for public health
but not wanting to be seen to be helping out the government. Reality Check The prime minister claimed that
there are â500,000 more jobs today than we had when the pandemic began"". According
toanalysis,externalpublished yesterday by the Office for
National Statistics (ONS), November saw the number of payrolled employees in
the UK rise by 424,000 since the start of the pandemic. The
figures reflect a recovery in the number of people in part-time jobs, which had
collapsed during successive lockdowns but now stands at just over 8 million. The resurgence in part-time work helped the unemployment rate fall to 4.2%. But
the ONS figures predate the arrival of the Omicron variant, which some fear may
lead to greater restrictions in some sectors. Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat, who chairs the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee, says he has received reports that Foreign Office staff numbers are about to be cut by ""10% across the board"". He asks how this could be compatible with the government's ""Global Britain"" ambitions. Boris Johnson says he has been assured by the foreign secretary that the report is ""fake news"", and adds that the UK is ""investing massively in overseas aid"". Labour MP Kate Hollern says that in his televised address on Sunday, the PM said every eligible adult would have the chance to get the jab by the end of the year. But she says the health secretary and health leaders have since said otherwise. She says the infrastructure to deliver on the target wasn't there and asks if there it is ""going to be another broken promise?"" Boris Johnson says delivering the booster programme will take a ""massive effort"" and be ""incredibly hard to achieve"". ""But do I believe our NHS and volunteers can do it? Yes I do."" Iain WatsonPolitical correspondent Itâs panto season and perhaps the most bizarre exchange at
PMQs was the claim by the PM that he won the Covid pass regulation yesterday on
Tory votes, with Sir Keir Stramer saying ""oh no, he didnât"" - and suggesting the PM was ""socially distanced from the
truth"". So what is the truth? Well, had Labour MPs sat on their
hands and abstained then 225 Conservative backed the Covid pass in England, and
126 MPs (not all Conservaive) voted against so in that sense the measure would
have gone through on Conservative votes. But had Labour voted against the measures, then Boris
Johnson would have been defeated. That said, some Conservatives might not have rebelled if
there had been a genuine prospect of defeating their own government. Knowing Labour would back the restrictions, they could
afford to put down a marker, and register a protest. So sometimes the truth has an elusive quality. That said, the bald facts are the PM suffered the biggest
rebellion of his premiership by a long chalk. Conservative Sir Bernard Jenkin says Russia is conducting a hybrid war against the West and asks what the government is doing about it. Boris Johnson says he told President Putin that if he were ""so rashly mad"" as to invade Ukraine, it would result in ""an extremely tough package of economic sanctions"". He adds that there would also be support for Ukraine and ""inevitably"" a build up of Nato forces in the nearby regions. Labour's Maria Eagle accuses Boris Johnson of ""repeatedly blocking"" her backbench bill to set up a public advocate to support relatives of people who die during major disasters, in the wake of the inquests into the Hillsborough stadium tragedy. Noting that the PM promised to set up such a position in his 2019 election manifesto, she asks whether this is ""another broken promise"" from Boris Johnson. The prime minister says the government recognises the importance of putting bereaved families ""at the heart"" of public inquests. He says funding for representation is available ""in certain circumstances"" and adds ministers are ""considering what steps should be taken"" in this area. Reality Check The
prime minister said at PMQs today: âWe won that vote last night with
Conservative votes."" But
the Labour leader Keir Starmer disputed that, saying: ""Without Labour
votes last night vital public health measures would not have got through."" They
are talking about last nightâs votes on plan B measures including on
mask-wearing and Covid passes. The
closest vote was the one on mandatory Covid passes, whichwent through by 368 votes to 126, with 100 Conservatives voting against the measure,external. If
the 142 Labour MPs who voted in favour of the measures had instead abstained
(not cast a vote) the motion would still have passed. But
if they had voted against it, it would have been defeated by 268 to 225. (While
the numbers are clear, the political calculations are more difficult to make, because
many Tory MPs may have felt safe rebelling knowing that the government's motion would be carried by Labour MPs.) The SNP's Stephen Flynn asks if ""the damage being caused by Brexit, a litany of broken promises, the condoning of Conservative party corruption or his complicity in lockdown-busting Christmas party quizzes has led to the public so dramatically and so rapidly losing faith in his leadership"". Boris Johnson replies that ""freedom from the European Union enabled us to deliver fastest vaccine roll-out in Europe and enabled us to have fastest economic growth in the G7"". Iain WatsonPolitical correspondent Keir Starmer didnât call for Boris Johnsonâs resignation. But he did urge him to fall on his sword. He invited him to look in the mirror and decide
whether he had the authority to lead. The Labour leader is using Boris Johnsonâs difficulties with
his own MPs to build up his own leadership credentials - something he has struggled to do during the pandemic. He is hoping that polling suggesting diminishing trust in
the prime minister will also equate to greater trust in the Opposition. But Sir Keir did not stick entirely to the image of  a
statesman, attacking the alleged rule breaking in Downing Street. His cover for this was that the public may be less willing
to follow rules if the PM doesnât do the same. This allowed Boris Johnson to attack the Opposition leader
for playing politics. But in doing so, there may be a hostage to fortune when he
dismissed allegations of rule breaking as ""partisan trivia"" when Labour believes this is of concern to target voters,
and before the cabinet secretary has set out the facts. The SDLP's Colum Eastwood also picks up on the parties row, accusing the PM of ""ignoring rule breaking"" in Downing Street last Christmas. He goes further than Keir Starmer and says the PM should resign, for ""eroding public confidence"" in Covid policies. Boris Johnson rejects this, saying he will be leading the government's efforts to help people ""get though this pandemic together"". The SNP leader in Westminster Ian Blackford says the Conservatives ""might be privileged enough to live in denial"" of the Omicron variant ""but the rest of us have a responsibility to live in the real world"". He asks Boris Johnson if he will be offering more money to help Scottish businesses hit by the rise in Covid cases. Boris Johnson replies that the Scottish government has the power to raise money if it chooses. Noting the big rebellion of Conservative MPs on new Covid rules, Blackford says: ""A prime minister who can't do what is needed to protect the public is no prime minister at all. ""If the PM can't act, will he give the devolved government the powers we need to protect our people,"" he asks. ""We are going to need a bigger waistcoat to contain the synthetic indignation of the MP,"" Johnson replies. He says Scotland has had a ""record settlement"" of Â£41bn but adds that he is working with the Scottish government ""to make sure we get through this thing together"". Reusing an attack line he used over the weekend, Keir Starmer says Boris Johnson is the âworst possible prime minister at the worst possible time"" and ""too weak to lead"". He asks whether this Christmas, the prime minister will ""look in the mirror"" and ask himself whether, after last night's rebellion, he still has the ""trust and the authority"" to lead the country. In response, Boris Johnson falls back on a familiar defence - and points out that Labour opposed the government's easing of restrictions last summer, and accuses the party of ""playing politics"". He also uses another phrase he has repeatedly used at PMQs to attack Labour, telling MPs: ""they vacillate, we vaccinate"". Keir Starmer says the PM has claimed ""for weeks that no rules were broken"" last year. ""I don't believe him, his MPs don't believe him, nor do the British public - he is taking the public for fools and it is becoming dangerous."" He says the PM has ""no hope of regaining the moral authority to deliver difficult messages"" amid further Covid restrictions ""if he cannot be straight with the public about the rule-breaking in Downing Street last Christmas"". Boris Johnson says he has ordered an inquiry into ""what went on last year"" adding that the Labour leader should explain ""why there are pictures of him quaffing beer"". He says the British public want politicians to ""focus on the matter in hand"". (The Sun newspaper had apicture of the Labour leader having a beer with party workers in May,external; Labour dismissed the claim, the paper reported.) Referencing the row over gatherings in Downing Street at the height of Covid restrictions last year, Keir Starmer says Boris Johnson has been ""undermining public confidence"". Quoting remarks made by several Tory MPs, he asks how people can be expected to follow his instructions when it comes to new measures for Omicron. The prime minister says the answer is there in ""what the public is doing"". He says he thinks the public is ""focused on"" the government's vaccine booster campaign, and calls the row over parties last year ""partisan trivia"". Keir Starmer says Labour showed the leadership that the PM lacked and adds that if it wasn't for Labour votes, his government wouldn't have been able to introduce vital health measures. The Labour leader says he can understand why Conservative MPs ""no longer trust"" their leader. He says in the summer the government promised that restriction relaxations would be irreversible. ""Like the rail revolution for the North, like 'no one will have to sell their homes for social care', just like no tax rises"" - Starmer says the PM ""over-promises until reality catches up"". Boris Johnson accuses the Labour leader of ""playing politics"". He argues that the government has rolled out a fast booster programme and created one of the fastest growing economies in the G7. ""We deliver, they complain,"" he says. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Positive,1.0
"This video can not be played Watch: Dozens of people are stranded on the roof of the WTC awaiting rescue Around 300 people were trapped on the roof of Hong Kong's World Trade Centre on Wednesday after a fire broke out. Local media reported that 13 people were injured and taken to hospital, with one woman in a critical condition. Police said the fire broke out in the machine room and moved to the scaffolding surrounding the building, which is currently under renovation. Those trapped on the roof have now been rescued, with more than 1,200 people in total evacuated from the building. Those who were injured are aged between 25 and 60, according to the South China Morning Post. Local media is reporting that a 60-year-old woman is in a critical condition in Ruttonjee hospital. A photograph from the building shows diners waiting to be rescued All the shops had been vacated during the extensive renovation works, leaving only several levels of the building in operation - mostly restaurants and offices, the South China Morning Post said. The blaze at the 38-storey World Trade Centre on Gloucester Road was first reported at lunchtime. Among those in the building when it caught fire was Meiling Lai, who was having lunch at a restaurant on the 12th floor when the building caught fire. She told the BBC the fire alarm went off about 10 minutes after smoke first appeared in the restaurant. ""We asked the wait staff what happened and they said something caught fire on the lift shaft on the fifth floor, but they didn't say a fire had broken out,"" Ms Lai told the BBC's Grace Tsoi. ""No alarm was heard. A staff member even said: 'We are not leaving yet, don't be afraid.'"" She ended up being trapped along with about 80 people on a podium on the fifth floor, she said, before the group was rescued safely by firefighters. Additional reporting by Zubaidah Abdul Jalil.

"A screenshot from Seoul Milk's controversial advert South Korea's biggest dairy brand has been forced to apologise over an advert which appeared to depict women as cows. The video by Seoul Milk shows a man secretly filming a group of people in a field, who later turn into cows. After facing a public backlash, the company removed the promo from YouTube, but it has since gone viral after being re-uploaded by internet users. Some also compared the man's behaviour to ""molka"", the illegal practice of secretly filming people. ""We sincerely apologise to everyone who felt uncomfortable with the milk commercial released on 29th last month,"" Seoul Milk's parent company Seoul Dairy Cooperative said in an apology posted online. ""We are accepting this matter seriously and will conduct an internal review, and take extra care to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future. We bow our heads in apology,"" it added. The clip starts with a man with a camera wandering through the countryside. ""We finally managed to capture them on camera in a place of pristine cleanliness,"" a male voice-over says. This is then followed by the man, hidden in bushes, filming a group of people, the most visible of which appear to be women, drinking from a stream and doing yoga. When the man accidentally steps on a twig it startles them and they suddenly turn into cows. The advert ends with the words ""Clean water, organic feed, 100% pure Seoul Milk.

"More restrictions could be introduced before Christmas in response to the new Omicron variant, Scotland's deputy first minister has said. John Swinney also urged people to take ""the greatest of care"" over household mixing. On Tuesday people were asked to limit socialising to three households at a time in the run-up to the festive period. But Nicola Sturgeon said the advice would not apply on Christmas Day. Shops and hospitality venues will also be told to bring back physical distancing and screens. It came as the number of confirmed Omicron cases in Scotland increased by almost 90% in just 24 hours. A total of 592 people were confirmed with the new variant on Wednesday, up from 296 on the previous day. Scots urged to limit socialising to three households Jabs need a major scaling up - but can it be done? Respiratory health expert Prof James Chalmers predicted further restrictions could be imminent as experts learn more about the new variant. The Scottish Conservatives said the restrictions were a measured response to last week'sOmicron evidence paper,externalwhich painted a ""scary and bleak picture"". Asked on BBC Radio'sGood Morning Scotlandprogramme if there could be another change to the rules before Christmas, Mr Swinney said: ""Potentially that would be the case but we obviously want to avoid that. ""We hope that we have done enough in the announcements that were made yesterday and we hope that members of the public and businesses will work with us in a cooperative spirit to make sure that we can take these provision forward."" Mr Swinney said he was ""optimistic"" enough was being done for now but cautioned that the percentage of Omicron cases in Scotland had soared from 2% about 10 days ago to more than 27%. ""We have a variant that is very powerful, that is growing at an alarming rate, and we face a very severe situation,"" he added. At Holyrood, Ms Sturgeon said she would have tightened hospitality rules further if she had financial support from the UK Treasury. Asked about this, Mr Swinney said they would have liked to extend physical distancing guidance and limit capacities at certain venues. The deputy first minister also said he expected the new measures to extend into the new year. Mr Swinney added people do not have to cancel their plans to attend mass events, such as a panto or a football match, but urged them to ensure they are fully vaccinated and to take a lateral flow test before they attend. Scotland aims to offer a booster shot to everyone over the age of 18 by the end of the month Scottish Conservative health spokesman Dr Sandesh Gulhane said Omicron was ""spreading like wildfire through our communities"". He said the new guidance was ""measured and what we need at the moment"" but further restrictions should not be ruled out as long as there is government support for businesses. The practising GP also described boosters as ""the way out of this"" and called for more drop-in vaccination facilities. Meanwhile, Prof Chalmers of Dundee University said the new variant has a rate of infection of 50% - one person with the virus in a room of 100 could infect 50 people. But he said the full picture of the threat it posed was not yet clear. ""I think the government needs to be ready next week, as we get more data on the vaccine protection against severe disease and other gaps that currently need to be filled in terms of our knowledge, to think about what other measures may be required,"" he said. ""If this is as bad as we think it is going to be there may still be other measures required over the Christmas and new year period."" Why do boosters work if two doses struggle? What are the new Covid rules across the UK? Covid in Scotland: Where are the latest cases? Meanwhile, the Scottish Grocers Federation told the programme it was ""the worst time of year"" for its members to introduce a queuing system. And Stephen O'Regan, who runs three Kitty of Shea's bars in Glasgow and Edinburgh, admitted he ""felt sick"" when he heard the first minister's update. The chain is already up to 60% down on bookings and fear some stock, such as the 300 kegs of Guinness ordered for December alone, may go unopened. The lack of detail from the government about the restrictions was ""frightening"", he added. Ms Sturgeon last week said that Scotland was facing a ""likely tsunami"" of new infections of Covid-19 in the weeks ahead, with a ""very significant"" impact on health services. In response, work is under way to ensure all eligible adults receive their booster vaccination by the end of the year. And guidelines limiting socialising to three adults and measures to cut down crowding in shops and bars were announced on Tuesday. However, schools are to remain open, with Ms Sturgeon saying it was a ""key aim to ensure that schools stay open if at all possible to minimise further disruption to education"".

The pandemic, conflict and drought in Afghanistan has brought the country to a ""tipping point"", the DEC warns. It said a million children under the age of five could die this winter. The UK government will double public donations, up to a total of Â£10m. The struggle to save Afghanistan's starving babies Afghans facing 'hell on earth' as winter looms The DEC said eight million people are at risk of starvation, with a rise in severe hunger across the nation. In total, 22 million people - more than half the population - currently do not have enough to eat, it said. Three million children under five are expected to suffer acute malnutrition. There is an urgency with temperatures falling to as low as -12C (10F) this winter. And the economic crisis has been made worse by the removal of financial support from Western nations after the Taliban seized power in August. On top of this, the severe drought - the worst in more than 25 years - has ruined much of the country's wheat crop and sent prices soaring. Saleh Saeed, chief executive of the DEC, said the situation was already ""beyond horrific"". ""We can't just sit back and watch,"" he said. ""We can't just let this happen."" Maryann Horne, of the British Red Cross, said people were living ""hand to mouth, not knowing where their next meal will come from"" and ""asking for the most basic help to feed their children"". She said people in Afghanistan were traditionally resilient but now had a ""sense of desperation"" with ""no light at the end of the tunnel"". ""We are sounding the alarm bell,"" she said. ""This is no longer about making things better, this is about saving lives, and reaching people before it's too late."" The growing humanitarian crisis has already led international donors to agree to transfer $280m (Â£210m) from a frozen fund to UN food and health services in Afghanistan. Western powers have refused to recognise the Taliban government officially. The US and other nations have frozen about $10bn of Afghan reserves, while the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund have also halted the country's access to funding. Appeals will be broadcast on the BBC, ITV, Channel 4, Channel 5 and Sky on Wednesday, as well as on both commercial and BBC radio stations. The money will help provide emergency food and nutrition for children, clean drinking water and winter kits to help families stay warm. It will also support healthcare facilities and protect women and girls, the DEC said. The committee brings together 15 leading UK aid charities to provide and deliver aid to ensure successful appeals The charities include Oxfam, Save the Children UK, Age International, British Red Cross, Cafod, Christian Aid and Islamic Relief Its website,externalprovides more details of its current appeals Donors to release frozen funds for Afghanistan The struggle to save Afghanistan's starving babies Afghans facing 'hell on earth' as winter looms Night-time curfew imposed in fire-hit areas of LA as police warn against 'despicable' looting 'I have nothing to go back to' - BBC reporter tells of LA fires heartbreak Trump avoids prison or fine in hush-money case sentencing LA fires: How three days of devastation unfolded What's the latest on the Los Angeles wildfires and what caused them?

Local media reported that 13 people were injured and taken to hospital, with one woman in a critical condition. Police said the fire broke out in the machine room and moved to the scaffolding surrounding the building, which is currently under renovation. Those trapped on the roof have now been rescued, with more than 1,200 people in total evacuated from the building. Those who were injured are aged between 25 and 60, according to the South China Morning Post. Local media is reporting that a 60-year-old woman is in a critical condition in Ruttonjee hospital. A photograph from the building shows diners waiting to be rescued All the shops had been vacated during the extensive renovation works, leaving only several levels of the building in operation - mostly restaurants and offices, the South China Morning Post said. The blaze at the 38-storey World Trade Centre on Gloucester Road was first reported at lunchtime. Among those in the building when it caught fire was Meiling Lai, who was having lunch at a restaurant on the 12th floor when the building caught fire. She told the BBC the fire alarm went off about 10 minutes after smoke first appeared in the restaurant. ""We asked the wait staff what happened and they said something caught fire on the lift shaft on the fifth floor, but they didn't say a fire had broken out,"" Ms Lai told the BBC's Grace Tsoi.

"The cost of living surged by 5.1% in the 12 months to November, up from 4.2% the month before, and its highest level since September 2011. Higher transport and energy costs drove the rise, which was above forecasts of a 4.7% increase, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. Its chief economist Grant Fitzner said more expensive fuel, energy, clothing and second hand cars were big factors. The cost of raw materials also rose significantly, he added. Inflation is the rate at which prices are rising - if the cost of a Â£1 jar of jam rises by 5p, then jam inflation is 5%. It applies to services too, like having your nails done or getting your car cleaned. You may not notice low levels of inflation from month to month, but in the long term, these price rises can have a big impact on how much you can buy with your money - sometimes referred to as the cost of living. Why is the cost of living going up? Since the UK economy reopened after lockdown, companies have struggled to keep up with a surge in consumer demand. Global supply chain problems, staff shortages and rapid demand for oil and gas have all driven up prices. The end of Covid support schemes and Brexit have also played a part. In November, petrol prices jumped to the highest ever recorded - 145.8p a litre - while the cost of used cars jumped due to shortages of new vehicles. A global shortage of computer chips for in new carshas led to a shortage of vehicles, leading to increased demand in the second hand car market. Even before Wednesday's figures, the food and drink industry had warnedthat the soaring cost of raw materials and ingredients was having a ""terrifying"" impact on consumer prices. Chrissy Jones from Frome has noticed energy price rises the most Consumers are feeling the impact of price rises. Chrissy Jones, from Frome, says prices for everything from insurance to food and petrol have gone up. ""We can't plan for the future,"" she says. Energy bills in particular are higher. The former People's Energy customer was spending about Â£1,000 for both electricity and gas each year. But when the firm went bust, she was switched onto the cheapest available tariff with British Gas, which is about double that. ""Do I fix at that price, or do I hope that the situation gets better? It's a bit of a gamble,"" she says. Ms Jones is on a pension and says a lack of security around knowing what she might be spending on bills in the New Year means that she and her family are putting off plans. A holiday in the next year was unlikely and her hopes to adopt a rescue dog were being put on hold. ""It wouldn't be fair on the dog and it wouldn't be fair on our purse,"" she says. ""It's just incredibly worrying - you wonder where it's going to end. How much more [are prices] going to go up?"" That's a concern. A quadrupling of natural gas prices in the last year has still to show its full impact on domestic energy prices. Many raw material costs are still rising, which will feed into higher prices if companies cannot absorb them. Rising inflation is not just an issue for the UK, and the government's hands are tied when it comes to dealing with what is a global problem.The latest figures for the US show prices rose 6.8% in the year to November,the highest level for almost 40 years. Wage inflation is also a factor. The latest inflation figure is substantially above the most recent figures on average pay rises of 4.3%, meaning living standards are effectively falling. On Wednesday, Britain's most powerful trade union, Unite, said it would act to ensure this effective pay cut was reversed. ""Current estimates suggest that costs for the typical UK family will jump by Â£1,700 in 2022,"" said Unite general secretary Sharon Graham. ""Workers did not create this cost-of-living crisis so why should they pay for it?"" On Wednesday, the ONS said the retail price inflation (RPI) measure - which includes housing costs, such as council tax, and is still linked to final salary pension payments, train tickets, mobile phone tariffs, and interest on student loans - rose to 7.1%. That's up from 6%, and its highest since March 1991. RPI rather than CPI is also used by unions for pay bargaining, and Ms Graham said members should fight for rises that matched this measure. ""Employers favour the CPI in cost calculations because it saves them money, but the truth is that this is a hidden tax on workers' wages,"" she said. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said on Wednesday he understood the impact being felt by consumers. He said: ""We know how challenging rising inflation can be for families and households which is why we're spending Â£4.2bn to support living standards and provide targeted measures for the most vulnerable over the winter months. But Labour claimed the government is not doing nearly enough to tackle the problem, especially as further inflationary pressures from rising energy costs are coming down the line. Shadow chief secretary to the Treasury Pat McFadden said: ""These figures are a stark illustration of the cost-of-living crisis facing families this Christmas. ""Instead of taking action, the government are looking the other way, blaming 'global problems' while they trap us in a high-tax, low-growth cycle."" The unexpectedly sharp jump in inflation, now more than twice the Bank of England's 2% target rate, will certainly intensify debate over a rise. On Tuesday, the International Monetary Fund predicted inflation would reach around 5.5% early next year - its highest in 30 years - and warned the Bank not to succumb to ""inaction bias"". The Bank has resisted a rate rise amid uncertainty aboutthe impact of the Omicron variant on economic growth and people's finances. Economist Samuel Tombs, at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said inflation is now ""uncomfortably high"" for the Bank, but believes rate-setters will still hold fire when they meet this week."" Yael Selfin, economist at consultancy KPMG, also thought the Bank would ""adopt a wait-and-see approach at this week's meeting"". Prices are rising at the fastest rate for a decade, 13 years if you use the ONS' favourite measure that includes owner-occupier housing costs. Inflation has risen above 5% more quickly than expected by the Bank of England and others, on a path to more than 5.5% by the spring, and it is likely to stay above the Bank's 2% target for the next two years. All of this reflects the lived experience of us all in petrol forecourts, supermarkets and department stores. The impact on living standards is material with real incomes now likely to be falling again. It does not make an interest rate rise on Thursday a done deal, given the economic uncertainty surrounding the rapid spread of the Omicron variant of coronavirus. The key economic uncertainty for the Bank and the Treasury is now what happens in companies and unions with how wages are set. When combined with ongoing labour shortages, there is a lot of pressure for companies to give considerable wage rises in the new year. While Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said he welcomes such a move, fear of a spiral of rising wages and prices is precisely what would lead to the Bank of England having to raise rates more quickly than currently expected over the next year. Given there is little expected respite from energy prices and rising taxes, an interest rate rise on the cards in the next few months, and ongoing Omicron restrictions, the outlook for early 2022 remains challenging for consumers and businesses.

"This video can not be played Inflation: Choice of heating the house or feeding children Families are having to choose between heating their homes and feeding their children due to rising prices, one charity has warned. The Splice Child and Family Project said some people had hit ""crisis point"" due to the cost of living. It said higher prices for baby essentials and fuel were causing problems for the families it supported. The cost of livingsurged by 5.1% in the 12 months to November,up from 4.2% the month before. This is its highest since September 2011 and above forecasts of a 4.7% increase, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. Half of families Â£110 a year worse off since 2019 Five items that are going up in price and why Minimum wage rates rise, but bills go up too The charity, based in Kenfig Hill, Bridgend county, offers counselling, support and basic supplies for parents with new babies who cannot afford to buy their own. Tracey Morgan, who helped set up the charity, said families who were already struggling due to the pandemic are now facing a ""crisis point"" due to the rising costs of living. Tracey Morgan says families potentially struggling with job losses or bereavement are now facing the additional impact of rising costs ""They are having to make that choice now - whether they heat the house or feed their children,"" she said. Splice offers food parcels to those who need them, and uses cash donations to buy nappies for struggling families. ""A couple of months ago we were paying Â£8 or Â£9 for a pack of nappies. And now you go in and it's Â£11 or Â£12 for a pack of nappies... I know it is making a difference to the families as well,"" said Ms Morgan. The situation affecting families in Kenfig Hill is not unique. Research from the Bevan Foundation shows as many as four-in-ten families are struggling to afford more than the basics. Dr Steffan Evans, head of poverty policy at the Bevan Foundation, said some families do not have acceptable living standards ""It means families are having to make really difficult choices and are not able to enjoy the living standards we all expect everyone to be able to have,"" said Dr Steffan Evans, of the Bevan Foundation. The think-tank last conducted this type of research in May, when the proportion of households feeling the pinch was 33%. The latest figure of 39% amounts to around 165,000 households, according to the Bevan Foundation. Mr Evans added: ""That's about the same number of households as there are in Gwynedd, who have now moved into difficulty affording their everyday needs, which just wasn't the case previously."" Prices at the petrol pumps have risen sharply this year. In the first week of January a litre of unleaded cost about Â£1.15, while a litre of diesel was about Â£1.20. Steady increases have seen fuel hit record prices, before beginning to decline a little in recent weeks. Unleaded petrol now costs an average of Â£1.46 per litre, while diesel prices average Â£1.49 per litreaccording to UK government data,external. Eating Christmas dinner with friends at Pyle Garden Centre, Bridgend, 83-year-old Patricia Jones said she was shocked at just how much her heating bills had risen. ""Our heating bill has gone up Â£100 a month. My husband couldn't believe it when he had the letter,"" said Patricia, from North Cornelly. For a group of women having a Christmas dinner at Pyle Garden Centre, increasing heating bills was the biggest cause for concern Heather Jenkins, 81, from Porthcawl, said she wasn't sure if she'd be able to keep her house warm this winter. ""What has been a big help is our winter fuel allowance, that helps tremendously,"" said Ms Jenkins. And Brenda Jenkins, 76, from North Cornelly, added: ""I do feel for families at the moment... I have got children, grandchildren, and they are finding it harder. Everything is increasing."" And it isn't only the heating bills, even the food they are eating has been affected by rising costs. Steven Falcon said prices at Pyle Garden Centre have risen slightly, but ""maybe not as much as they should"" The Bank of England has previously said inflation was forecast to hit 5% next spring, and while consumers are seeing prices rise, businesses are also facing increased costs. Steven Falcon, the manager of Pyle Garden Centre, said he had tried to ""meet in the middle"" with prices as suppliers have started charging more. ""Some of our suppliers have held to their prices, but two of our biggest suppliers have had huge [price] increases,"" he said. ""We try and absorb a little bit of it ourselves. There is no way out of it really, we have to put our prices up somewhat.""

"Supporters of the bill celebrated outside Malta's Parliament House on Tuesday Malta has become the first EU country to legalise the cultivation and personal use of cannabis. Adults will be allowed to carry up to seven grams of cannabis, and grow no more than four plants at home. But smoking it in public or in front of children will be illegal. Several other nations have similar plans, such as Germany, Luxembourg and Switzerland. Countries like the Netherlands tolerate cannabis use in certain circumstances. Malta's parliament voted in favour of the reform on Tuesday afternoon, with the bill winning 36 votes in favour and 27 against. Equality Minister, Owen Bonnici, said the ""historic"" move would stop small-time cannabis users from facing the criminal justice system, and would ""curb drug trafficking by making sure that [users] now have a safe and regularised way from where they can obtain cannabis"". However, Malta's opposition Nationalist Party voted against the change. In October, its leader Bernard Grech - who initially supported the new law - warned it would ""only lead to the strengthening of the illegal market, with organised crime taking advantage,"" according to The Times. Opponents have called on Malta's president, George Vella, not to sign it into law, which is the final, ceremonial stage. Under the changes, anyone carrying more than seven grams, but less than 28g could be fined up to â¬100 (Â£85; $112). The punishment for smoking in public will be a â¬235 fine, and those smoking cannabis in front of anyone younger than 18 could be fined up to â¬500. Associations will be set up to distribute the drug or seeds to cultivate cannabis, therefore regulating how much someone buys - and a person can only be a member of one association. There is also support for minors who are found with cannabis. They will be recommended a care plan or treatment as opposed to facing arrest or criminal charges. The move by Malta, the EU's smallest member state, is likely to be the first of a number of nations changing their cannabis laws after the UN last year reclassified cannabis to recognise its therapeutic uses. The governments of Luxembourg, Germany and Switzerland have all announced plans to establish a legally regulated market. Cannabis is still technically illegal in the Netherlands, which is famous for its cannabis cafes. Howeverthere is a tolerance for the drug,externalwhen it is sold in the coffee shops. Italy will hold a referendum on the issue next year, while South Africa, Mexico, Jamaica, Portugal and a number of US states already have similar legislation in place. Uruguay was the first country in the world to legalise cannabis for personal use in 2013, followed by Canada in 2018.

"The debt has been accumulated under both parties, said Democrat Chuck Schumer US lawmakers have voted to raise the national debt limit, just days before a potential US credit default. The measure, which President Joe Biden is expected to sign into law in the coming days, raises the US borrowing limit by $2.5tr (Â£1.9tr). Treasury officials had warned that the economy could slip into a recession if it was not raised by mid-December. The vote comes after a bipartisan deal was struck last week to raise the limit through a one-time-only rule change. That agreement, which was struck between Senate Democratic Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Republican Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, saw 14 Republicans vote along with every Senate Democrat to change the rules. The deal allows Democrats to raise the limit on their own through a simple majority, rather than by 60 votes, which would be needed to overcome a Republican filibuster. Democrats and Republicans have normally voted together to raise or suspend the debt ceiling, but this year Republicans have said that Democrats should be responsible for doing it on their own. On Tuesday, the vote narrowly passed the Senate by a vote of 50-49. The House passed the bill by a vote of 221-209. It will now be sent to President Joe Biden for his signature. The measure also suspends the debt ceiling until 2023 - after the 8 November midterm congressional elections that could shift the balance of power in Washington. The bill increases the US borrowing limit to $31.4tr from $28.9tr and brings an end to a months-long row between both parties that continued despite both sides agreeing that a default would severely harm the US economy. The increased limit is in part needed to pay off the $7.85tr in additional debt added by the Trump presidency through tax cuts and Covid spending. ""This is about paying debt accumulated by both parties,"" Mr Schumer said in a speech on the Senate floor ahead of the vote. ""The American people can breathe easy and rest assured there will not be a default,"" he added. What's next for the US debt limit Long December looms for US Democrats Mr McConnell, whose party had condemned Democrats for their $1.9tr Build Back Better social spending plan, warned Americans in his remarks: ""If they jam through another reckless taxing and spending spree, this massive debt increase will just be the beginning."" The US spends more than it takes in through taxes each year, requiring the government to sell bonds as a means of borrowing money. A 1939 law requires Congress to set a limit for how much debt can be held, leading to dozens of votes since  to raise the figure. What is the US debt limit?

"Shaun Bailey was a youth worker before entering politics A former Conservative mayoral candidate who attended a Covid regulation-breaching Christmas party has quit as chair of a police and crime committee. Shaun Bailey's team organised the gathering at the Conservative Campaign Headquarters on 14 December 2020 when London was under Tier 2 restrictions banning household mixing. He has now stepped down from the role but remains a member of the committee and the London Assembly. Mr Bailey has yet to comment. On Tuesday night, a photograph emerged in the Daily Mirror of the party. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has condemned the event, saying: ""That scene is absolutely unacceptable. ""It is unacceptable for people to be breaking the rules. That was not authorised by the Conservative Party,"" Mr Shapps told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""Those Conservatives who were on secondment from the party have already been disciplined and whatever further action needs to be taken will be taken."" Mr Bailey founded a youth charity after finishing his degree A spokesperson for the Greater London Authority Conservatives said Mr Bailey chose to step down to prevent the ""unauthorised social gathering"" distracting from the committee's work of holding the mayor of London to account. Last week it emerged that four members of Mr Bailey's campaign team had been disciplined over the party in the basement of the Conservatives' Westminster base. Which parties are being investigated? He was said to have briefly attended to give a speech thanking the group, some of whom stayed on for the banned gathering, at its end-of-year-briefing. Born in North Kensington to a British-Jamaican family, Mr Bailey has been a member of the London Assembly since 2016. Mr Bailey, who has a degree in computer-aided engineering from London South Bank University, co-founded a charity called MyGeneration in 2006; it ceased operations in 2012 due to financial problems. Mr Bailey, who came second to Labour's Sadiq Khan in May's London mayoral election, had faced mounting calls to quit against a backdrop ofthe launch of an official probeinto three government parties. Labour, Green and Liberal Democrat Assembly Members have come together in a joint call to Cressida Dick, the Metropolitan Police Commissioner, to investigate reports of the party. The statement reads: ""Londoners, once again, feel let down and angry at these reports. So many people have made huge sacrifices over the last 21 months, particularly those who have been working on the front line, including your officers, and those lives have been directly and often tragically, impacted by Covid-19. ""It is essential that all those who breach the rules are held to account."" Boris Johnson announced last week that top civil servant Simon Case would lead an inquiry into a video of a mock press conference in which government spokeswoman Allegra Stratton joked with fellow staffers about a party held at 10 Downing Street in breach of regulations. The clip, first shown by ITV News, was recorded last year on 18 December - a day on which more than 400 Covid deaths were reported. Ms Stratton apologised and resigned over the video.
