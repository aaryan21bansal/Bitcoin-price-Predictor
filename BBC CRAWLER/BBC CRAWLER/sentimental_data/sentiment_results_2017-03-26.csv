"Jermain Defoe, whose last England appearance was in November 2013, is the 22nd player to reach the 20-goal landmark for the country Jermain Defoe scored in his first international appearance since 2013 as England took another comfortable step in their qualifying campaign for next year's World Cup with victory over Lithuania. Gareth Southgate's first game at Wembley since succeeding Sam Allardyce on a permanent basis provided few alarms as England remain firmly in control at the top of Group F. Sunderland striker Defoe, 34,  justified his call-up with a typically clinical finish after 21 minutes and a lively performance that suggested he still has a part to play under this manager. And when Southgate needed someone to break Lithuania's stubborn resistance after the break, substitute Jamie Vardy obliged from close-range in the 66th minute, converting a subtle touch from Liverpool's Adam Lallana inside the area. Before kick-off there was a minute's silence inside the stadium for the victims oflast week's London attack.There was also a tribute paid to formerEngland manager Graham Taylor, who died in January. Relive the action from Wembley Stadium Quiz: Can you name England's oldest goalscorers? How the England players rated What is Southgate's best England XI? Pick your own side ""He looks like a player full of hunger who has lost none of his predatory, goalscoring instincts."" Eyebrows were raised in some quarters when Southgate recalled Defoe to the squad having last represented his country against Chile at Wembley in November 2013. Defoe's inclusion, however, represented perfect sense with a record of 14 Premier League goals and two assists in a Sunderland side propping up the table and England's main striker Harry Kane out injured. And so it proved as he pounced in trademark fashion for his first England goal in four years and four days since scoring in an easy win against San Marino, clipping a clinical finish high beyond Lithuania keeper Ernestas Setkus after 21 minutes from Raheem Sterling's delivery. Defoe had already brought one crucial block from the keeper earlier as he stole in on Lallana's pass. He looks like a player full of hunger who has lost none of his predatory, goalscoring instincts. England will face stubborn opposition again before this World Cup qualifying campaign is over and a poacher like Defoe may well come in very handy for Southgate as he plots his route to Russia next summer. Manager Gareth Southgate's England next play in June, against Scotland England's friendly against Germany in Dortmund on Wednesday was effectively a testimonial for veteran striker Lukas Podolski on his international farewell - with an atmosphere to match in the normally thunderous Signal Iduna Park. Wembley was also on the subdued side because World Cup Qualifying Group F is a hard-sell in terms of excitement for England's fans, who understandably expect Southgate's side to dismiss opposition such as Lithuania with the minimum of fuss. England fulfilled those requirements comfortably in the face of stubborn opponents who sat back and invited them on in the early phases, then seemed intent on damage limitation and no more as any hope of getting a return from this qualifier evaporated. There may be more of the same in the remaining home qualifiers against Slovakia and Slovenia but England, once again, are getting the job done as they move closer to reaching the World Cup. The old lingering fear remains that the real measure of how far England are progressing under Southgate will come at a major tournaments, where their limitations have been exposed regularly. Southgate can be satisfied from what he has got from England's international double header, with a creditable performance in defeat against World Cup holders Germany and victory here against Lithuania. If he has a complaint, it could be that England need to be more ruthless in front of goal, paying for wasted opportunities in Dortmund and also missing chances to make this a more convincing margin of victory. England will not find this failing too expensive in a friendly or against mediocre opposition - but it could cost them if the flaws are on show against higher-class in a competitive environment. It is why Defoe's marksmanship is currently required and why the return of a fit and in-form Harry Kane will be so welcome. The Sunderland striker showed he still has all the old goalscoring instincts England manager Gareth Southgate: ""I thought it was one of those afternoons where it's job done. ""I am not going to eulogise over the performance, but the overall week I think has been really positive in setting the tone of how we want to work. ""The players have got a good feel about them, a spirit and they see the direction we want to head. For sure, we'll play better than we did today."" Lithuania boss Edgaras Jankauskas: ""I am very proud of my team because we have been tested by a tremendously strong team - probably the strongest team we have faced until now. ""We will take a lot of positives from this loss, to see what targets can be set because what we witnessed today in the first half was unbelievable how skilful all those attacking players are and what amount of pressure we were put under."" England are the only team to have kept a clean sheet in each 2018 World Cup qualification game so far. Vardy's goal was his first touch of the match. Lallana has been directly involved in four goals in his last five England appearances (three goals; one assist). Defoe is the 22nd player to reach the 20 goal landmark for England. England next qualifier is against Scotland at Hampden Park on Saturday, 10 June.

"Khalil Rafati's life had been destroyed by drug addiction As Khalil Rafati overdosed on heroin for the ninth time the paramedics frantically tried to save his life. A drug addict who slept rough on the streets of Los Angeles, he eventually regained consciousness after the medical team used a defibrillator to give him an electric shock. This was back in 2003, when Khalil was 33 years old. Also addicted to crack cocaine, he weighed just 109lb (49kg), and his skin was covered in ulcers. ""I was arrested more times than I can remember [for drug offences],"" says Khalil. ""I was completely messed up... I was always in so much pain that I couldn't sleep."" While Khalil had tried and failed to get clean before, he says that after his ninth overdose he finally realised that he had to change his life in order to save it. So he spent four months in a rehab centre - and has been drug-free ever since. Throwing himself into healthy living, Khalil has been so successful in rebuilding his life that today he is the millionaire founder and owner of fashionable Californian health food business Sunlife Organics. Khalil has transformed himself since 2003 With annual sales of more than $6m (Â£4.8m) from its six outlets - which combine juice bars and cafes, and also sell the firm's clothing line - and via its website, the company is preparing to expand to 16 other US states and into Japan. Now aged 46 and accustomed to travelling by private jet, he's come a long way since his days of sleeping on the streets. In fact, Khalil's life story could be the plot of a Hollywood movie. Born in Ohio in the US Midwest, he is the son of a Polish Jewish mother and a Muslim father. A troubled childhood saw him leave school without any qualifications, and get arrested for vandalism and shoplifting. In 1992, aged 21, he moved to Los Angeles with dreams of becoming a movie star. The business sells a range of fruit and vegetable juices While the acting career never really took off, he started playing in local bands, and made a good living cleaning cars for Hollywood stars including Elizabeth Taylor and Jeff Bridges, and Guns N' Roses lead guitarist Slash. However, he soon slid into drug addiction, and his life spiralled out of control. Eventually he was sleeping in cardboard boxes beside other junkies, and dealing drugs to help fund his own habit. Then after that fateful ninth overdose Khalil's life completely changed for the better. After successfully quitting drugs he kept himself busy by juggling several jobs. In addition to working at two rehab centres in Malibu he washed cars, walked dogs and did gardening work. The company is due to expand to 16 other US states and into Japan ""I was able to save money,"" he says. ""I worked hard, seven days a week, 16 hours a day."" Khalil also started to become obsessed with making his own vegetable and fruit juices after he met an old friend from Ohio. ""He was a little bit like a hippie, and started teaching me about vitamins, organic food, super food,"" says Khalil. ""At that moment I was looking for anything that would make me feel better."" In 2007 Khalil rented a house and opened his own rehab centre, Riviera Recovery, for clients who would pay $10,000 a month to stay at the facility. Khalil now treats himself to travelling by private jet For these residents, Khalil would make exotic juice blends such as one he called Wolverine - a mix of banana, maca powder, royal jelly and pollen. Eventually the reputation of these drinks spread beyond the building, with people calling in to buy them. His old self was often arrested Realising that there was enough demand to set up a separate business, in 2011 Khalil launched Sunlife Organics, together with his best friend and then-girlfriend. Funding the business from savings, the first branch opened in Malibu. Khalil says it was an instant success, with sales of $1m in its first year. Today the business employs more than 200 people across its six outlets. In addition to juices, it now sells a range of food and clothes, such as t-shirts and hoodies. Rob Nazara, an analyst at Deutsche Bank in New York, says Khalil's story shows real strength of character. ""No matter what the educational or professional background someone may have, the success of an entrepreneur is driven by grit, determination and ambition,"" he says. Khalil released his autobiography in 2015 Besides Sunlife Organics, Khalil still runs Riviera Recovery and owns a yoga studio in Malibu. He also made time to write his autobiography, I Forgot To Die, which was released in 2015. ""I don't consider myself super intelligent,"" says Khalil. ""But I have a hunger for life, and put all of myself into something when I decide to do it.""

"Single mothers have often been stigmatised and denounced. Cherry Healey explains why she's proud to be one. I'm a single mum. I'm glad I live in an age and a place where it's OK to admit that. We have moved on so much, so fast. Once, Margaret Thatcherdeemed,externala single parent family so bad for a child that she felt it was better for the mother and child to be removed and placed within a religious group. When I first heard that, I felt such unbelievable pain and heartbreak for all those young mothers that were pressured into following this advice. And it would have had many ripples of pain for the family as a whole. The judgement of others is a powerful thing and people will do unfathomable things to avoid bringing shame onto themselves and their families. And this is the judgement that I want to see gone. Completely. Cherry Healey Yes we have progressed - but even today there is such an insipid, damaging view of single parents that we need to keep revisiting it until single parents feel free of useless, ignorant judgement - and instead receive respect as parents and support if they, and therefore their child, needs it. Sadly, even in 2017 I felt the cold wind of judgement when I became a single parent. It's hard to know whether the judgement I felt comes from society or whether it comes from myself. I think it is a bit of both. I hate to admit this, but I had a negative view of single mums before I became one. As I grew up I heard, read and watched society's depiction of The Single Mum, and it certainly wasn't positive. Cherry Healey meets women who fought to prove that being a single mum doesn't have to mean being a bad mum in her documentaryThe Single Mum Thing. You can listen to Cherry's entire single parents series for BBC Radio 4's Woman's Houron the programme's website. Comedy sketches depicting single mums smoking cigarettes and drinking cider in the park while neglecting their babies, endless newspaper stories about single mothers on benefits draining the system, statements from politicians about the connection between ""Broken Britain"" and one-parent families - all fed my prejudice gremlin until one day, I too was a dreaded single mum. And I began to question everything I'd ever consumed about this subject. I was happy to discover that I was the same person. I was a good parent as a married woman and I was a good parent as single mother. Money was tighter but my ability to maintain order at home, get homework done on time and love my children had not changed. Separating and re-establishing my life was difficult but I felt so hugely grateful that at least I was able to pay the bills thanks to my job - and it made me realise that there is so much stigma attached to being a single mother. At exactly the time when the single parent needs support and help, they are stigmatised and judged. It also made me realise that for many of us there is a strong, not very flattering stereotype of The Single Mum. And so I wanted to break free from that and give a voice to some single parents that haven't been heard before. And I'm glad to say that any prejudice, both conscious and subconscious, was gradually eroded. I spoke to Kirsty, a single mother with a terminal illness, who smashes the traditionalist's argument that it's better to stay in an unhealthy marriage, regardless of the circumstances. Even though she was suffering and weak from cancer, she did not regret leaving her relationship and was happy that her daughter's environment was at least peaceful. Kirsty with Cherry She acknowledges that it was hard caring for her daughter alone: ""I definitely still have guilt over it. There are times at bedtime when she'll cry for her daddy."" But she still feels it was the right decision. She is now able to co-parent with her partner in a more harmonious way. Her message that together is not always best for the child, even in such a challenging situation, was powerful. I also spoke to Meena, whose story moved me profoundly. Knowing that she would be disowned by her family, Meena made the decision to leave her husband as the environment had become so toxic that social services had been involved. ""I come from an Asian background so divorce or separation - that's a no-no,"" she tells me. ""I was expected to remain in the marriage and make it work and just put up with it,"" she says. ""If I go to a family function I get looked at like a demon with two horns."" This video can not be played Chris Hart: 'They were all shocked when I said I was keeping the baby' I was given, and desperately needed, a huge amount of emotional and logistical support from my family during my separation, and it's hard to image the impact the removal of that would have had on my mental state and therefore the indirect impact on my children. Without financial, emotional or logistical support, Meena began a new life with her child, with the help of her flexible work shifts as a train driver. The resilience was startling but the grace was profound. Even after being rejected by her family, at exactly the moment she and her daughter needed care, she was still working towards a reconciliation for the sake of her daughter's future. When I think about the negative single-mother narrative in the 90s and subsequent reduction of support, and increase in single-mother stigma, it made me feel extremely angry that as a society we leave incredible mothers like Meena fighting against such a huge tide. And for others, the term single parent felt like a strange fit. Rupa (not her real name), an accident and emergency consultant, had decided to go it alone and conceive via a sperm donor. There was nothing ""broken"" about it, a term often placed on to a single parent. It had been carefully considered and planned for. Rupa recalls: ""We met once before the first insemination, and then the next time he came round and donated, and then showed himself out while I was just chilling out in my own bedroom, playing music, and you know he left me a little pot on the stairs and showed himself out."" I spent the morning in her house watching her beautiful, happy daughter play and cuddle her mother. Again, I struggled to understand why anyone would assume single mothers can't offer as much love and security to a child as a two-parent family.

"If you walk down Whitehall in central London, you cannot escape reminders of wars fought and empires run from this small district on the north bank of the Thames. There are memorials to the fallen, statues of field marshals and even a Turkish cannon captured in some long-forgotten conflict. Yet the civil service that once gloried in its global administrative stretch is now the smallest it has been since World War Two. And with the government launching the British state on its greatest administrative, economic and legal reform since it committed the nation to total war in 1939, there is a simple question: is Whitehall up for Brexit? ""It's been a scramble but the ducks are in a row,"" one Cabinet minister told me confidently. For the scale of the challenge is immense. Thousands of civil servants to be mobilised and retasked, thousands of laws and regulations to be rewritten or rejected and thousands of people trained and employed to do the many things currently carried out by the European Union. This endeavour is not only about the two years of initial negotiations with 27 EU member states that will shortly begin, it is also about the mammoth preparations the UK must make for leaving the EU whatever the outcome of the negotiations. ""The challenge of Brexit has few, if any, parallels in its complexity,"" says Sir Jeremy Heywood, the Cabinet Secretary. ""Its full implications and impact on the political, economic and social life of the country... will probably only become clear from the perspective of future decades."" Sir Jeremy Heywood, the Cabinet Secretary, believes Brexit has ""few, if any, parallels in its complexity"" Perhaps the greatest challenge the civil service has faced was its utter lack of preparation for the British people voting out in the referendum last June. They were expressly forbidden from drawing up any plans by David Cameron's administration and have been playing catch up ever since. Ministers say the civil service has responded well, creating two new government departments from a standing start. The Department for Exiting the EU (DExEU) has something north of 320 staff, the Department for International Trade, several thousand. Both departments, along with the Foreign Office, have been given an extra Â£400m by the Treasury over the next four years to pay for their work on Brexit. There were some initial turf wars but officials now say there is greater singularity of purpose. Much work has been done analysing options, quantifying markets and assessing laws. Huge volumes of paper have been landing on DExEU desks looking at the impact of Brexit on every aspect of the economy. Brexit: All you need to know about the UK leaving the EU What is Article 50? A guide to what happens now What will happen to UK trade post-Brexit? The aim is to allow David Davis, the Secretary of State for Exiting the EU, to draw up an a la carte menu for the prime minister, setting out potential options and costs so that she can navigate the negotiations ahead. For there is no doubt that these will be Theresa May's negotiations. The main negotiating team will include Mr Davis, his permanent secretary, Olly Robbins, and Sir Tim Barrow, the UK permanent representative to the EU. Below them will be civil servants from all affected government departments, summoned in to work on specific ""chapters"" of the negotiations, on everything from fish to agriculture to financial services. They will be the team dealing with the European Commission negotiators on an almost daily basis. Yet above them will be Mrs May who will have to drive the talks and make the big calls. But such is the size of the task that even the prime minister will struggle to retain her usual iron grip. One minister told me: ""This is the first big test to see if she can delegate. This is so big that No 10 cannot control it, they cannot be on top of all the detail."" Theresa May has made it clear that she will drive the UK's Brexit negotiations Not all are so sanguine about the preparedness of Whitehall. The National Audit Office says in a new report that, while 1,000 new roles have been created in the civil service to deal with Brexit, a third remain unfilled and most of the new appointees have simply been transferred from other parts of government. And the Institute for Government warns that departments such as the Home Office and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs are underfunded, cannot afford more staff and will be forced to drop non-Brexit work. Other insiders warn that, although much work has been done setting out options, less thought has been devoted to how the negotiations will progress themselves and how the government should organise itself. Officials talk of not knowing precisely for what they are preparing because Downing Street refuses to reveal its negotiating plans. The process, inevitably, will begin with negotiations about the negotiations. Who will talk to whom, about what and in what order? The UK government wants to discuss its divorce from the EU at the same time as its future trade relationship. The EU says the two issues must remain separate. Unstitching the UK from EU laws will be an intricate process Then will come the exit agreement itself. Much will be visceral and hard-fought. Protecting the rights of EU nationals in the UK and vice versa sounds easy as both sides say they want this to be resolved early on and want to keep the status quo. But the hugely complex detail will be hard to agree. Yet sorting that out might be easy compared to agreeing how much money, if any, the UK will owe the EU when it leaves. The government says nothing, the EU is hinting at Â£50bn. And all this is before any negotiations about any future trade arrangement between the UK and the EU and any transitional process that may be needed. While this will generate a huge amount of work for some in the civil service, many other officials will be focused instead on preparing the UK for leaving the EU come what may. Much of this will focus on Westminster. There is the Great Repeal Bill to be written and passed through Parliament to ensure that all EU law is transferred automatically into UK law the moment we leave. The aim is to ensure there is no legal chaos and to allow Parliament all the time it needs gradually to unstitch the UK from four decades of EU legislation. This will be a massive piece of legislative work that will require officials to re-examine huge swathes of UK law. They will have to decide which bits of EU law to return to Westminster and which bits are devolved, a tricky issue in light of Holyrood's demand for a second independence referendum. The Institute for Government warns there might be a need for further 15 separate Brexit Bills. The UK will have to forge a new trade relationship with both the EU and the WTO In the short term, there are a huge number of separate parliamentary inquiries into Brexit - 55 in all - being carried out by various committees of MPs and peers. Ministers have to reply to each one within 60 days and officials are struggling to meet that deadline. Then there is the process of the UK re-establishing its status at the World Trade Organization (WTO), something that will be needed even if we get a new trade deal with the EU. The government hopes to transfer its current EU tariff rates into a new UK-specific schedule of trade commitments. But such a ""copy and paste"" arrangement will be complicated and will almost certainly face challenge from other WTO members. UK diplomats in Geneva, where the WTO is based, have a hard job of reassurance ahead of them. And then there is also the process of creating new organisations that will fill the gaps in our national life left as the EU tide ebbs from our shores. Officials will need to set up new customs and immigration systems, neither of which will be simple or easy. So, as the phoney war ends with the triggering of Article 50, Whitehall is facing perhaps its greatest challenge in a generation.

"""Dad, what happens when you die?"" ""I don't know, son. Nobody knows for sure."" ""Why don't you ask Google?"" Of course, Google isn't clever enough to tell us whether there is life after death, but the word ""google"" does crop up in conversation more often than either ""clever"" or ""death"", according to researchers at the UK's University of Lancaster. It took just two decades for Google to reach this cultural ubiquity, from its humble beginnings as a student project at Stanford University in California. It is hard to remember just how bad search technology was before Google. In 1998, for example, if you typed ""cars"" into Lycos - then a leading search engine - you would get a results page filled with porn websites. Why? Owners of porn websites inserted many mentions of popular search terms such as ""cars"" in tiny text or in white on a white background. The Lycos algorithm saw many mentions of ""cars"", and concluded the page would be interesting to someone searching for ""cars"". In the Google era, this seems almost laughably simplistic. But Google's founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin were not, initially, interested in designing a better way to search. Sergey Brin (L) and Larry Page (R) were trying to map the credibility of academic papers when they devised Google Their Stanford project had a more scholarly motivation. In academia, how often a published paper is cited is a measure of its credibility, and if it is cited by papers that themselves are cited many times, that bestows even more credibility. Mr Page and Mr Brin realised that if they could find a way to analyse all the links on the nascent world wide web, they could rank the credibility of each web page in any given subject. To do this, they first had to download the entire internet. This caused some consternation. It gobbled up nearly half of Stanford's bandwidth. Irate webmasters showered the university with complaints that Google's crawler was overloading their servers. Why the falling cost of light matters How Ikea's Billy took over the world How economics killed the antibiotic dream How the invention of paper changed the world But as Mr Page and Mr Brin refined their algorithm, it became clear they had discovered a vastly better way to search the web. Porn websites with tiny text saying ""cars cars cars"" don't get many links from other websites that discuss cars. If you searched Google for ""cars"", its analysis would be likely to yield results aboutâ¦ cars. Mr Page and Mr Brin quickly attracted investors, and Google went from student project to private company. It is now among the world's biggest, bringing in profits by the tens of billions. But for the first few years, Mr Page and Mr Brin burned through money without knowing how or if they would make it back. They were not alone. During the dotcom boom, shares in loss-making internet companies traded at absurd prices, in anticipation that they would eventually figure out viable business models. Google found its model in 2001: pay-per-click advertising. Advertisers pay Google when someone clicks through to their website, having searched for specified terms. Google displays the highest-bidders' ads alongside its ""organic"" search results. From an advertiser's perspective, the appeal is clear: you pay only when you reach people who have demonstrated an interest in your offering. It is much more efficient than paying to advertise in a newspaper. Newspapers have seen a significant decline in display advertising Even if its readership matches your target demographic, inevitably most people who see your newspaper advert won't be interested in what you are selling. No wondernewspaper advertising revenuehas fallen off a cliff. The media's scramble for new business models is one obvious economic impact of Google search. But the invention of functional search technology has created value in many ways. A few years ago,McKinsey tried to list the most important,external. One is timesaving. Studies suggest that googling is about three times as quick as finding information in a library, even discounting the time spent getting there. Likewise, finding a business online is about three times faster than using a printed directory such as the Yellow Pages. Traditional directories such as the Yellow Pages have struggled to compete with online search tools McKinsey put the productivity gains of this into the hundreds of billions. Another benefit is price transparency - economist jargon for being able to stand in a shop, take out your phone, google a product you're thinking of buying and seeing if it's available more cheaply elsewhere, then using that knowledge to haggle - annoying for the shop, helpful for the customer. Then there are ""long tail"" effects. In physical shops, it makes no sense to display aisle after aisle of obscure products that will be bought only rarely - they focus on a limited range of bestsellers instead. But a decent search facility makes it easy to find a needle in the product haystack, and that has enabled the rise of online shops offering more variety. Customers with specific desires are more likely to find exactly what they want, rather than settling for the nearest thing available in the local supermarket. And entrepreneurs can launch niche products, more confident they will find a market. This all sounds like excellent news for consumers and businesses. 50 Things That Made the Modern Economyhighlights the inventions, ideas and innovations that have helped create the economic world.

Google dominates the search market, handling close to 90% of searches worldwide. Many businesses rely on ranking highly in its organic search results. And Google constantly tweaks the algorithm that decides them. Google gives general advice about how to do well, but it is not transparent about how it ranks results - not least because that would give away the information necessary to game the system. We would be back to searching for cars and getting porn. Google explains how its search works in principle but guards the details of its all-important algorithms You don't have to look far online (thanks, Google) to find business owners and search strategy consultants gnashing their teeth over the company's power to make or break them. If Google thinks you are employing tactics it considers unacceptable, it will downgrade you. One blogger complains that Google is ""judge, jury and executioner"". ""You get penalised on suspicion of breaking the rules, [and] you don't even know what the rules are,"" they say. Trying to figure out how to please Google's algorithm is rather like trying to appease an omnipotent, capricious and ultimately unknowable god. You may say as long as Google's top results are useful to searchers, it's tough luck on those who rank lower - and if those results stop being useful, then some other pair of students at Stanford will spot the gap in the market and dream up a better way. Right? Maybe - or maybe not. Search was a competitive business in the late 1990s. But now, it may be a natural monopoly - in other words, an industry that is extremely hard for a second entrant to succeed in. The reason? Among the best ways to improve the usefulness of search results is to analyse which links were ultimately clicked by people who previously performed the same search, as well as what the user has searched for before. Google has far more of that data than anyone else. That suggests the company may continue to shape our access to knowledge for generations to come.

"Spare a thought for those who are bestowed with troublesome names. That can happen anywhere, of course. But, in Zambia, Chris Haslam came across some very surprising choices. Under a darkening sky on a dusty, potholed track in eastern Zambia, a small boy is struggling to push a large, Chinese bicycle. Its handlebars, crossbar and panniers are stacked impossibly high with yellow jerry cans, firewood and a sack of rice. Because the boy needs both hands to keep the bike upright, he can't sweep the flies from his eyes. But this seven-year-old is labouring under a much heavier, but less visible burden. His name is Mulangani. It's a Nguni word meaning ""punish me"". Or ""he who must be punished"", if you want to get formal. Who, I asked my driver Mavuto, would give their child such a horrible name? ""Maybe his grandfather, maybe the chief,"" he shrugged, explaining that across Zambia and neighbouring Zimbabwe, it is common for parents, especially in rural areas, to invite community elders to choose the name of a newborn. ""Sometimes the chief wants to punish the family,"" says Mavuto. ""Or he may think this new child is too much for the family to bear."" Watching the boy's Sisyphean progress towards his distant home, that name suddenly seems disturbingly apt, but he's not the only one cursed with a dismal name. In later days, I meet Chilumba - ""my brother's grave"", Balaudye - ""I will be eaten"", Soca - ""bad luck"" and Chakufwa - ""it is dead"". I also meet Daliso, whose name means ""blessings"" and Chikondi, which means ""love"". Maybe it's me, but they do seem happier. ""In African culture, there is a trend of naming children according to the circumstances surrounding their birth,"" says Clare Mulkenga-Chilambo, a care worker at SOS Children's Villages in Zambia. ""It's good for those born at bright and merry moments but unfortunate for the others."" And there are a lot of others. HIV and Aids have ravaged Zambia, and although infection rates are now falling, 55,000 adults and 5,000 kids became infected in 2015. Countrywide, an estimated 380,000 children have been orphaned by Aids and 85,000 are living with HIV. Ask Massiye, or ""orphan"", or Chisonis - ""sadness"", or the sad-eyed Chimwamsozi, whose name means ""drinker of tears"". Or nine-year-old Komasi, whose name means ""kill him"", and his little brother Komaniso, aka ""kill him also"". ""Most Zambians have several names,"" says Kangachepe Banda. His name means ""well off"" or ""richness"", and as a safari guide he's doing OK. ""You're talking about the first one. It's called thezina la bamkombo- or the name of the umbilical cord. After a birth, the mother and child hide away until the cord drops off. On that day, the baby is presented to family and neighbours, and the person honoured with choosing the name makes his decision."" Use of this name is supposed to be limited. It's supposed to be kept between the namer and the named - a dark reminder to the growing child that one person saw into his or her soul at birth. The church, says Clare Mulenga-Chilambo, offers deliverance. ""Most people turn to Christianity and on baptism, they are given Christian names,"" she says. ""This gives them the opportunity to give up their traditional name, which is often seen as the cause of whatever misfortune they could have been facing in their lives"". But there are some here who see opting for the homogenised anonymity of John, James or Mary as a dereliction of tradition. Others feel that the names must be kept not just out of respect to elders but also as a guarantee of ancestral protection. If the name maketh the man, then surely Zambia's notoriously grim prisons are full of unfortunates who've been saddled with names like Chidano, Mapenzi and Chananga - that's  ""hatred"", ""trouble"" and ""wrongdoer"" respectively? ""It's possible,"" concurs Muvato. Growing up, he knew a kid called Chiheni, which translates as bad boy, or thug. ""He ran away from home when he was 12,"" he says. ""He is in prison in South Africa for the attempted murder of a security guard.""

It's a tin-roofed hut with a neat vegetable patch patrolled by bickering chickens and a dog called Imbwa. Which means ""dog"". Sometime soon, says Mulangani, I'm going to be baptised. My new name will be Emanuel. It means God is with me. He smiles. He likes Emanuel. As we drive away, there's a storm brewing in the west. The potholes are getting deeper and the clutch is playing up. As the first fat raindrops splatter the dusty windscreen, it suddenly strikes me that I haven't asked Mavuto whathisname means. He grimaces as he struggles to find third gear.

"Before the war: Mai (left) and her sister look out across the Sanaa skyline in 2009 It is two years since the start of the Saudi-led military campaign in Yemen in support of the government ousted by Houthi rebels. In that time, thousands of civilians have been killed, parts of the country devastated and Yemen left teetering on the brink of famine. Here the BBC's Yemen-born Mai Noman, who has returned to her homeland to film short documentaries, reflects on what has become of her country. It's been over two years since I was last here. The only place I call home. A lot has happened and much has changed. It's hard to keep my feelings in check. Beside the physical destruction, memories of what once was are buried under the heavy weight of emotional rubble. Mai and her brother grew up in Taiz As a Yemeni journalist working in international news, I have had to monitor every twist and turn of the civil war in my country, even when I wanted to look away. Truthfully, the thought of coming face-to-face with the new reality shaped by the furious conflict in Yemen has terrified me. But living through the war from outside Yemen was isolating. As we make our way to the capital, Sanaa, on a rugged 10-hour car journey from Aden, I think back to the number of times I quietly broke down after hearing news coming out of Yemen. Working in a newsroom, this happened often. This trip takes me from the south to the north - two parts of a country divided by more than mere miles. In simple terms, the south is under government control, backed by the Saudi-led coalition, and the north is controlled by the Houthi rebels. But the reality is more complicated. I've imagined arriving back home hundreds of times in the last few years. But on the day I was totally unprepared for what I found. Unlike the southern city of Aden, where life seems to be at a standstill, waiting in fearful anticipation of more fighting, Sanaa - apart from the obvious damage - appears the same as ever. Some beautiful buildings in Sanaa have escaped unscathed I can feel the rain approaching. After London that should make me shudder, but it somehow feels welcoming. The jagged mountains which encompass the city slowly fill with clouds transforming the sky into a splendid portrait of misted rocky peaks. All at once telling me I'm home. The Yemeni capital has suffered like other parts of the country, but life there goes on There are more restaurants in town than I recall, and many are over-flowing with people. For a moment I forget there's a war raging across the country. But then Sanaa can be deceptive. I feel exhausted by the time we arrive at my cousin Mona's house. I knock on the door in a typical Yemeni manner - very determinedly. Mona's youngest child, Abdullah, opens the door to greet me. Mai's aunt's car sits where it was hit by a falling missile in the garden of her home It's quite quiet here. A minute later I hear Mona making her way down the narrow stairs at the back of the house. We embrace with joy. She holds my face to see what's changed. ""You're still you,"" she says. A lot kinder than comments I receive later about how my hair is too short or the few extra pounds I've gained. Mona is just as beautiful but her voice has changed, she's gone through a lot in the last few years. Three years ago she lost her father suddenly. She had been very close to him and facing life without him, amid ongoing uncertainty, is hard. ""He was the biggest support I had,"" she tells me, breaking down in tears. Life hasn't been kind to her and the war has now brought with it seemingly endless questions. Would her family be able to leave if it had to? Is it better to be stuck inside surrounded by conflict, or outside separated from relatives and friends? Are Mona's children safe at school or sleeping in their beds? How many more funerals will she have to attend? I have no answers. Even with the most difficult issues I face in my own life, the choices are never so bleak. Our lives have become more different than ever. Over the course of three weeks in Yemen, I reconnect with old acquaintances and hear stories of separation, loss and incredible examples of the tight bonds that keep a community together. But something else weighs heavily on my heart. There is one place I wasn't able to visit. It's the place where I was born and where a more utopian notion of Yemen was engraved in my mind. My grandmother's house in Taiz. But sadly my grandmother is no longer with us and Taiz today is unrecognisable, sitting as it does on the frontline of the conflict. I wonder if I'd even know the house. The fighting on the ground is brutal, the bombardment by the Saudi-led coalition is relentless and the siege on the city by the Houthis continues. It's painful trying to accept the way things have become, one where precious memories have no place among the hardship of this grinding conflict. To me, Taiz is where the heart of home is, and there's nothing harder than losing one's home. When I set off for Yemen it was with a mixture of dread and trepidation at what I might find after years of bombardment and fighting. On arriving I fell into a false sense of relief that the people were still here; home was, in some form, still here. In the days which followed though, it became clear that war damage isn't just the craters and the bombed out buildings. It is the suffering of a population watching helplessly as their lives are being torn apart. Thinking of the time I spent fearing what I'd find when I returned home, I know that regardless of the pain of seeing my country at war, the sense of longing to be part of Yemen, for good or bad, will always draw me back. Yemen's humanitarian catastrophe Who's fighting whom?

"The jacket and briefcase were precious possessions of two refugees These are two unremarkable items with a remarkable story: a traditional embroidered jacket and drab, brown leather briefcase. They belonged to a man and a woman who lived in Punjab in undivided colonial India, had been introduced to each other by their parents and were to be engaged when violence broke out in 1947. The troubled subcontinent was lurching towards a bloody partition as it split into the new independent nations of India and Pakistan. Communal violence erupted, leaving between half a million and a million people dead and displacing millions of people. Punjab was divided - western, mostly Muslim parts went to Pakistan and eastern, mainly Hindu and Sikh parts, went to India. The newly-engaged man and woman were Sikhs living in what is now Pakistan. The jacket and the briefcase were their most valuable possessions as they fled their homes to escape death as communities butchered each other in a prolonged frenzy of religious rioting. Three of Bhagwan Singh Maini's brothers had already been slaughtered in the violence, so the 30-year-old man stuffed his certificates and property claims in the fraying briefcase and fled his home in Mianwali. More than 250km (155 miles) away, in Gujranwala, Pritam Kaur's family slipped out of their house and put her on a train to Amritsar. Ms Kaur, 22, travelled across the blood-stained border with her two-year-old brother on her lap. In her bag was her most precious possession, the phulkari (embroidered) jacket, a reminder of happier days. Bhagwan Singh Maini and Pritam Kaur reunited in a food line at a refugee camp and got married Torn apart by what turned out to be one of the greatest mass migrations - or transfers of population - in human history, the two landed up in teeming refugee camps that dotted Amritsar city. They were among about 12 million people who had crossed the new borders. One day, in the food line, a miracle happened. Both Mr Maini and Ms Kaur had joined the queue of bedraggled, hungry refugees. There, they met again. ""They exchanged notes about their tragedies, wondering if it was destiny that had brought them together once more. Their families, or whatever was left of them, also reunited in due course,"" says Cookie Maini, daughter-in-law of Bhagwan Singh Maini. Perhaps the biggest movement of people in history, outside war and famine. Two newly-independent states were created - India and Pakistan. About 12 million people became refugees. Between half a million and a million people were killed in religious violence. Tens of thousands of women were abducted. This article is part of a BBC series looking at Partition 70 years on. Read more: Special report on partition Partition 70 years on: The turmoil, trauma - and legacy In March 1948, the two got married. It was an austere ceremony; both families were struggling to pick up the pieces. Ms Kaur wore her favourite jacket. Mr Maini got together his certificates and papers from his briefcase to start a new life: he joined the judicial service in Punjab, got a small house in compensation and moved to Ludhiana with Ms Kaur. The couple had two children, who both served as civil servants. Mr Maini died some 30 years ago; Ms Kaur died in 2002. ""The jacket and the briefcase,"" says Ms Maini, ""are testimony to the life they lost and found together."" The couple reunited in line in a refugee camp at a time when millions were crossing the new borders They now survive as two of the most valuable possessions of India's fledgling Partition Museum, which opened in Amritsar in October. By early next year, the museum, housed in the magnificent and restored Town Hall, will showcase photographs, letters, audio-recordings, belongings of refugees, official documents and maps and rare newspaper clippings relating to the event. ""This will be the most comprehensive archive on the partition, and the only museum of its kind in the world,"" says Mallika Ahluwalia, chief executive officer of the two-floor, 17,000 sq ft Partition Museum. Memories of a desperate partition journey History of the 1947 partition of India,external Why India and Pakistan fight over Kashmir There are the stark black-and-white pictures of the never-ending caravan of Hindu and Muslim refugees, trudging wearily to what will be their new homes. Bullock carts overflow with sparse belongings and withered humans. Millions of refugees were on the move; one single convoy was reported to have stretched for 10 miles. Trains awash with the blood of murdered refugees steamed across the new borders. Too few police and soldiers were deployed to check the ensuing violence. Historian Ramachandra Guha says the ""protection of British lives was made the first priority"". Women bore the brunt of the violence: tens of thousands were abducted. Many, but not all, were eventually recovered. Tent cities sprouted all over the country to house the displaced farmers, artisans, government workers, traders and labourers. By 1950, there were some 200,000 refugees in squatter colonies in the eastern city of Calcutta alone. Refugees abandoned millions of hectares of their own farm land and many received scant compensation: a widow who lost her husband's 11,500 acres of land in two districts which went to Pakistan was given 835 acres in a village in Indian Punjab. The bloodbath continued months after the event Months after the event, the bloodbath was still continuing. The front page of a Punjab-based newspaper in October paints a picture of utter despair and anarchy in the state. Armed mobs were attacking villages, towns were plunged into darkness, there is a story about the ""moon coming to the rescue of millions"" after a power outage as well as accounts of a cholera outbreak, floods and details about millions of people stranded in refugee camps awaiting evacuation. ""Life here continues to be nightmarish,"" wrote India's first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru in October 1947. ""Everything seems to have gone awry"". Until you hear - and see evidence of - stories of hope and redemption, of lives lost and recovered, as in case of Bhagwan Singh Maini and Pritam Kaur. With these stories and more, the museum in Amritsar hopes to remind people of an event which author Sunil Khilnani described as ""the unspeakable sadness at the heart of the idea of India"".

"Linares beat Crolla to take the WBA lightweight belt in September Anthony Crolla was outclassed in his bid to regain the WBA lightweight title as talented Venezuelan Jorge Linares produced a superb display at Manchester Arena. Crolla - unanimously outpointed when the pair met in September - was rarely able to get close enough to his opponent to cause damage and was dropped by a stinging Linares uppercut in the seventh round. Though he responded admirably, roared on by around 15,000 in the arena, Crolla always looked at the mercy of Linares' variety of shots and even when pockets of promise arrived for the home fighter, he often quickly faced blows in return. The pair embraced on the bell, Crolla sporting a look of frustration as his opponent's hand was raised with the scores 118-109 on all three scorecards. Relive Crolla v Linares as it happened Listen to the fight again here (from 06:00 BST on Sunday) Taylor beats Koleva on points The hope was this boxing cauldron could witness a Manchester fighter memorably upset the odds some 12 years after Ricky Hatton stunned Kostya Tszyu here on a night those present still talk glowingly about. The reality was that Linares' combination of pedigree, experience and will to trade with ferocity if needed, proved too much. A world champion by 21, Linares has held world crowns in three weight divisions. The 31-year-old's 14 years as a professional showed as he picked his shots with guile, the uppercut finding its target on several occasions as his upper-body movement consistently opened up the shot. Crolla, who admitted he ""lost to the better man"", deserves credit. His career has been a rollercoaster from the moment he suffered a fractured skull and broken ankle when trying to apprehend burglars in 2014. A draw and victory against Darleys Perez saw him claim a world title within a year, only for Linares to take it in what was Crolla's second defence. The rematch was never the same contest. Though those in attendance sang passionately for their fighter - a heavy underdog - they could not shake a man who looked ice cool and has now contested 41 of his 45 fights outside of Venezuela. He will now seek a Las Vegas payday against WBC champion Mikey Garcia, while Crolla will likely need to rebuild domestically if he is to come again at world level. Crolla was knocked down for the first time in five years when Linares caught him with a powerful uppercut in the seventh round As Tony Bellew screamed ""show no respect Ant, make it ugly"" from ringside, Crolla embarked on a workmanlike opening two rounds. His guard was constantly high, Linares by comparison confident to lower his own when not at close range. It meant Crolla was unable to get up close to his opponent as Linares' free hands were piston-like to keep his man at distance. His shots were blisteringly quick, a two-shot combination ending with a right uppercut in the third. Crolla gutsily stepped forward to close ring space - a feat he claims he let slip late in the pairs' first meeting - and he finally smothered Linares in the fourth, landing two uppercuts at short range. But Linares snapped the home fighter's head back with a sublime uppercut of his own in six, dipping his body to the left before launching the shot with thrust. It drew a collective grimace from the crowd. Linares -  at times tip-toeing with grace and constantly exuding confidence - dropped his man with the same shot in seven. Crolla rose and pumped his hands in defiance as the crowd tried to lift him but as both men walked to their corners, Linares sported a grin of satisfaction. Now cut above his left eye, Crolla responded with the grit which has endeared him to so many in recent years. A left hook to the jaw and later the body landed in the 10th but he was never able to find a pace or land the shots which could fluster an opponent of such class. ""He's a great champion,"" Crolla said, speaking on Sky Sports. ""Manchester, I am so sorry I couldn't do it for you. Your support means so much to me. He caught me but before that I thought I could get to him. I got beaten by the better man - no excuses. ""I am 30 years old, I am going to rest, but I believe I can go again."" In an interview with BBC Radio 5 live, Crolla added: ""I could just not pin him down. I was pleading with Joe (Gallagher) to let me go on (for the last round), and you still believe you can land a shot. ""I'm gutted I couldn't do it in front of these fans."" After the final bell, the two fighters embraced before the winner was announced Crolla's trainer Joe Gallagher told BBC Radio 5 livewhy he wanted to take Crolla out of the fight after the 11th round. Gallagher said: ""I thought we were not going to win this, but Anthony pleaded and said 'let me go on'. He wanted to go out on his shield. ""Linares was very good and everyone could see what a great world champion he is. You have seen one of the best pound for pound fighters in the world."" Promoter Eddie Hearn told BBC Radio 5 live:""I thought after the first fight Jorge Linares would not perform a career-best performance and he did. He was absolutely brilliant. ""It is so hard when Anthony Crolla comes up to you and says 'I'm so sorry'. You lost on points to one of the best pound for pound fighters. ""We will choose an easier world title. Anthony Crolla will be back 100%, he is an ultimate professional and a credit to himself."" Heavyweight world title contender Hughie Fury on BBC Radio 5 live Crolla has the heart of a lion. He tried his best to fight him, box him, out-think him, but Linares had too much skill, too much movement. There is nothing worse than when you miss the shots and then get hit. It is demoralising. He didn't look hurt in there, but he was out-skilled and out-boxed. Anthony Crolla has now lost six times in his 40-fight career, while Linares has won 42 of his 45 contests BBC Radio 5 live boxing pundit Steve Bunce The crowd cannot perform miracles and Linares was a magician in there. When you lose to a man like that, there is no shame for Crolla. BBC Radio 5 live boxing commentator Mike Costello Linares was simply too good and too classy for the game and the brave Anthony Crolla.
