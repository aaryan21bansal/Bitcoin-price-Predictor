"Stagecoach's contract to run the East Coast Mainline rail franchise will end earlier than expected after the government said the operator had ""got its numbers wrong"". Transport Secretary Chris Grayling said Stagecoach would continue running the London to Edinburgh line only for ""a small number of months and no more"". He said the government may step in to run the service. He added that the day-to-day operation of the line would be unaffected. The East Coast Mainline franchise was taken into public ownership in 2009 after being run by National Express. It was reprivatised when Stagecoach and Virgin signed a deal to run the East Coast line from 2015 to 2023, promising to pay the government Â£3.3bn to run the service. Stagecoach owns 90% of the joint venture and Virgin owns the remaining 10%. In November, the Department for Transport said Stagecoach and Virgin would withdraw from running the service three years early, in 2020, after running into difficulties. But on Monday Mr Grayling told the House of Commons the situation was now ""much more urgent"" and that new arrangements were needed ""in the very near future"". Mr Grayling said he was considering two approaches. One option was to allow Stagecoach to continue operating the franchise on a short-term and not-for-profit basis until a new contract is awarded in 2020. Alternatively, East Coast Mainline could be brought back under government control and be run by the Department for Transport through an operator of last resort. Mr Grayling said: ""The problem is that Stagecoach got its numbers wrong. It overbid and is now paying a price."" East Coast decision investigated by watchdog 'Indefensible' deal over East Coast rail Plan to fix 'creaking' railways unveiled by government Labour former transport secretary Lord Adonis accused Mr Grayling of ""undertaking another unjustified bailout of Virgin and Stagecoach at the expense of taxpayers"". He said: ""The reason for these disgraceful bailouts we've been seeing from Mr Grayling is because he simply is not prepared to contemplate putting his duty above ideology and substituting for failing private companies a state company."" However Mr Grayling insisted that there was ""no question of a bailout"" for the company, adding: ""Stagecoach will be held to all of its contractual obligations in full."" He said Stagecoach was set to lose about Â£200m, equating to more than 20% of its total market value. Mr Grayling said: ""It should also act as a stark warning to any company tempted to over-bid in future."" At the same time, Mr Grayling also announced that another joint venture between Stagecoach and Virgin had won an extension to operate the West Coast Mainline rail service between London and Glasgow. He said that this joint venture will operate the West Coast Mainline from 1 April 2018 until potentially 31 March 2020. A Stagecoach subsidiary is also on the shortlist of bidders hoping to operate the East Midlands franchise, scheduled to begin in August 2019. Shadow transport secretary Andy McDonald said: ""That Chris Grayling awarded a profitable contract to Virgin and Stagecoach on the West Coast while simultaneously confirming the same companies have collapsed on the East Coast shows Government policy is in chaos. ""This is yet another Tory handout to private shareholders at the public's expense. Failing train companies should not be awarded future contracts, but this government is rewarding them for failure by extending their lucrative deal."" Mick Whelan, leader of the train drivers' union Aslef, said: ""It is outrageous that Virgin Trains has been handed a lucrative new contract to run services on the West Coast Mainline despite serious criticism of its owners' handling of the East Coast franchise."" Stagecoach Group Chief Executive Martin Griffiths said: ""A lot has been said and written in the past few months about Virgin Trains East Coast - a lot of it has been misinformed and much of it has been politically motivated."" He said Stagecoach and Virgin had delivered for passengers, employees and the economy including generating payments to the taxpayer of more than Â£800m. ""The reality is that we've neither walked away from the East Coast franchise  nor have we received or asked for any special treatment,"" he said. There are no legal grounds to prevent Stagecoach from bidding for current or future franchises, Mr Grayling told the Commons.

"Otto Warmbier's parents attend the State of the Union on 30 January 2018 The father of a US student who died after he was released from a North Korean jail will attend the Olympic games as the US vice-president's guest. Mike Pence announced on Twitter that Fred Warmbier, Otto Warmbier's father, will attend the opening ceremony in Pyeongchang, South Korea on Friday. Both Koreas are set to march under one flag, signalling a thaw in relations. But Mr Pence said he wants Mr Warmbier to remind the world of North Korea's human rights abuses. Allow Twitter content?

According to the Washington Post,external, which first reported on Mr Warmbier's trip, the delegation is the latest US attempt to put pressure on the isolated country to halt their ambitions to become a nuclear power. Last week Mr Warmbier's parents attended US President Donald Trump's first State of the Union address to Congress as guests of Melania Trump. ""You are powerful witnesses to a menace that threatens our world, and your strength inspires truly us all,"" Mr Trump said to Fred and Cindy Warmbier and their younger children, Austin and Greta. ""Tonight, we pledge to honour Otto's memory with total American resolve,"" he added, before also praising a North Korean defector who fled his native country on crutches. Harrowing tale of Trump's North Korean defector Mr Pence leaves on Monday for a five-day trip to South Korea and Japan, culminating with a stop in Pyeongchang for the start of the Olympics. Otto Warmbier, an Ohio native and student at the University of Virginia, was sentenced to 15 years of hard labour in North Korea after he was accused of stealing a hotel sign. Warmbier parents describe N Korea 'torture' Mr Warmbier, then 21, was studying abroad in Hong Kong in 2016 when he joined a travel company on a trip to North Korea. He was released and returned home in June 2016 on medical grounds. He was in a coma when he arrived back in the US and died shortly after. Otto Warmbier's parents say they went 15 months without hearing from or about their son North Korea said he suffered from botulism, which many US doctors dispute. His parents said he was ""systematically tortured"" by North Korean officials, but the regime denies the claims. The coroner who examined his body said there were no clear signs of torture but thathe died from a lack of oxygen to the brain. In September, Mr Trump said that the student was tortured ""beyond belief"" by North Korea. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Police stood guard outside the the Supreme Court on Monday evening A former president of Maldives, who was in power for three decades, has been arrested at his home as a crackdown on the opposition intensifies. Maumoon Abdul Gayoom was detained after the government declared a 15-day state of emergency, suspending parliament and sending police to the Supreme Court. President Abdulla Yameen has refused to comply with a court order to release political prisoners. The army have been ordered to resist any move to impeach him. The court also ruled that the 2015 trial of another former President, Mohamed Nasheed, had been unconstitutional. Judges who were at the Supreme Court when police arrived have reportedly been held against their will overnight. Boris Johnson, foreign secretary of the UK, the former colonial power, called on President Yameen to lift the state of emergency. ""The damage being done to democratic institutions in Maldives andthe sustained misuse of process in Parliament is deeply worrying,"" he said in a statement.,external The US National Security Council has warned in a tweet that ""the world is watching"" the Maldives, which has a population of 400,000 and depends on tourism to power its economy.

Political turmoil threatens 'island paradise' Maldives leaves Commonwealth over democracy row Former Maldives leader 'given UK asylum' Olivia Lang, BBC News Last week's Supreme Court ruling very much caught the government on the back foot but it had been difficult to see how they would manage to avoid implementing it in the face of domestic and international pressure. With drastic measures, it seems. President Yameen clearly saw a threat to his rule and is pulling no punches in fending off the challenge. The mood has turned from tense to fearful. More arrests are expected to take place overnight. Maldivians are passing around messages telling one another to ""be safe"". With many constitutional rights suspended, there is little protection. Now aged 80, he ruled the country autocratically before the Maldives became a multi-party democracy in 2008. A half-brother of current President Yameen, he has now aligned himself with the opposition. He was detained in a police raid on his home, the opposition says. Shortly before, he tweeted about a large police presence outside. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

In a video posted online the ex-president addresses his supporters (in Dhivehi),external, saying that he has not ""done anything to warrant arrest"" and urging them to ""remain strong"". There were judges inside the court when it was stormed but a court spokesman said he was unable to contact them. ""I just spoke to the Chief Justice and he told me that the gates of the Supreme Court [were] being stormed by the military,"" Husnu al-Suood, president of Maldives Bar Association and a former attorney general, told Reuters news agency late on Monday. ""He is inside and nobody can go out or come in. The emergency means the Supreme Court activities are suspended and nobody is in charge of the judiciary."" A Supreme Court spokesperson told local media that security forces were holding all the judges against their will. Mr Nasheed, the island nation's first democratically elected leader, was convicted under anti-terrorism laws of ordering the arrest of a judge and sentenced to 13 years in prison. Ex-President Mohamed Nasheed has told the BBC he plans to return to the Maldives to contest elections However the verdict was internationally condemned and he was given political asylum in the UK the following year after being allowed to travel there for medical treatment. The Supreme Court also ordered the reinstatement of 12 MPs, which would see the opposition's parliamentary majority restored. It sacked the police commissioner for pledging to enforce the ruling and ordered the detention of two opposition MPs who had returned to the Maldives. The Maldives previously declared a state of emergency in November 2015, after the government said it was investigating a plot to assassinate Mr Yameen. That move came two days before a planned protest by Mr Nasheed's Maldivian Democratic Party. Mr Nasheed, who is in exile in Sri Lanka, told BBC News that the government's ""brazenly illegal"" actions amounted to a coup. ""Maldivians have had enough of this criminal and illegal regime,"" he said. ""President Yameen should resign immediately."" An opposition MP, Eva Abdulla, said the state of emergency was a ""desperate move"" that showed the government had ""lost everything [including the] confidence of the people and institutions"". On Sunday, opposition supporters demanded the release of nine jailed MPs What many people associate Maldives with... Breathtakingly beautiful beaches and breathtakingly expensive luxury hotels, says the BBC's South Asia correspondent Justin Rowlatt. The nation is made up of 26 coral atolls and 1,192 individual islands. But while the water of the coral reefs that surround them may be crystal clear, politics in the ""island paradise"" has always been very murky indeed, our correspondent adds. Since President Yameen took power in 2013 the country has faced questions over freedom of speech, the detention of opponents and the independence of the judiciary.

"This video can not be played Barnier: It's time for UK to make a choice The UK will face ""unavoidable"" barriers to trade if it leaves the customs union and single market, the EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier has said. Speaking in Downing Street, he said the ""time had come"" for the UK to choose what it wanted after its 2019 exit. Brexit Secretary David Davis said the UK's position was ""perfectly clear"". The UK, he argued, wanted a free trade deal with the EU but also the freedom to strike deals with other countries, where trade opportunities were growing. ""There's no doubt about it. We are leaving the customs union but we are aiming for a good future for Britain,"" Mr Davis said. He also said he was confident the two sides would reach an agreement on a ""transitional"" or ""implementation"" phase - to last between 18 months and two years after the UK leaves next year - in time for an EU summit at the end of March. After lunch with Mr Davis and a 20-minute meeting with Theresa May, Mr Barnier said there was ""some divergence"" between the two sides when it came to issues relating to transition and how the exit deal would be enforced. Kuenssberg: The clock is ticking Explained: Customs union and single market Reality Check: How soon are Brexit answers needed? What is the Brexit 'transition phase' all about? While he said he respected the UK's decision to rule out any form of long-term customs union and other so-called ""red lines"", he said it was a prerequisite of any deal that ""everyone plays by the same rules"" during the transition period - where the UK would have to comply with existing EU laws and regulations. He said he wanted greater clarity from the UK about what ultimate partnership it wanted with the EU after its departure, expressing his hope an ""official position"" would be put forward soon.

""The only thing I can say, without a customs union and outside the single market, barriers to trade in goods and services are unavoidable. The time has come to make a choice."" The government's 11-strong Brexit cabinet sub-committee will meet on Wednesday and Thursday as UK officials prepare to brief their EU counterparts on their vision for post-Brexit relations on Friday. At the same time, there will be initial discussions on the ""transitional"" period as well as efforts to convert the details of December's agreement on the Irish border, citizens' rights and money into a legal framework. Ahead of this, Downing Street ruled out any form of customs union with the EU, which would give the UK access to tariff-free trade within the bloc but mean it cannot negotiate its own deals with other countries.

Downing Street said the government had set out two potential alternatives last summer - a new customs partnership without the need for any customs checks and a ""highly streamlined"" arrangement in which EU arrivals would be subject to customs checks but in a way that minimised disruption through technology. No 10 would not say which was the preferred option and said work was continuing on both proposals. Conservative MEP Daniel Hannan said Switzerland was an example of a country which had both its own customs arrangements with the EU and an independent trade policy. Michel Barnier was welcomed to No 10 by David Davis ""Britain is a global country, a world trader,"" he told the BBC's Daily Politics, adding that the UK had been ""artificially penalised"" by the customs unions because it trades more outside the EU than inside. But former attorney general Dominic Grieve said he found Downing Street's intervention ""rather strange"" since the UK would have to maintain some form of ""customs union or alignment"" with the EU if it was to honour the terms of its agreement to prevent any hard border on the island of Ireland. Ministers are looking at two options to ensure ""frictionless"" trade after Brexit Labour said it was ""foolhardy"" to rule out any kind of customs union with the UK's largest trading partner. ""The government must put jobs and the economy first, not their own internal party wrangling,"" a party spokesman said. In the House of Commons, ministers faced criticism for delays in putting forward new post-Brexit immigration rules. The government has said new border controls will be brought in when EU free movement rules no longer apply, but a promised White Paper policy document has yet to be published. Businesses groups have expressed frustration at the wait for concrete proposals. And in an urgent Commons question, Labour MP Yvette Cooper, who chairs the Home Affairs Select Committee, said it was a ""shambles"" and accused the government of ""kicking the can down the road"". Immigration Minister Caroline Nokes denied this, saying it was ""imperative"" that the White Paper and an immigration bill were the ""right pieces of legislation"" when they were brought to the Commons. ""We will publish a White Paper in the coming months, when the time is right,"" she said. Rudd hits back at Brexiteers What happens now that a deal's been done?

"US stocks suffered their worst falls in more than six years on Monday in a sell-off sparked by concerns of higher interest rates. The Dow Jones Industrial Average index tumbled 1,175 points, or 4.6% to close down at 24,345.75. The White House moved to reassure investors saying it was focused on ""long-term economic fundamentals, which remain exceptionally strong"". Signs of improvement in the economy had driven US markets to record highs. Ever since he was elected in November 2016 President Donald Trump has tweeted a number of times about the increase in US stock markets, using the gains since he took office to illustrate market improvement. ""Economic news from the US has been stronger than anticipated,"" said David Kuo, chief executive of financial services advisory Motley Fool. ""So, perversely, the market correction has been caused by positive economic news"". Monday's decline is the largest decline in percentage terms for the Dow since August 2011, when markets dropped in the aftermath of ""Black Monday"" - the day Standard & Poor's downgraded its credit rating of the US. The drop on the Dow was closely followed by the wider S&P 500 stock index, down 4.1% and the technology-heavy Nasdaq, which lost 3.7%. In London, the FTSE 100 index of leading companies also fell to close down 1.46% or 108 points lower. In Tuesday's early Asian trade, stocks were following Wall Street's lead. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 sank 4.8% before recovering slightly, while Australia's benchmark S&P/ASX 200 was down 2.7%. In South Korea, the Kospi lost 2.3%. Asian markets are following Wall Street's lead - but why? Investors are reacting to changes in the outlook for the American and global economy, and what that might mean for the cost of borrowing. The stock market sell-off accelerated on Friday when the US Labour Department released employment numbers which showed stronger growth in wages than was anticipated. CMC Markets analyst Michael McCarthy said the wage numbers ""blew lower interest rates out of the water"". ""The share selling....reflects a higher than previously anticipated interest rate environment,"" Mr McCarthy said. US jobs and wages rise in January The US economy in six charts In response to that, investors moved to sell out of stocks and put money into assets like bonds which benefit from higher interest rates. ""This isn't a collapse of the economy. This isn't a concern that markets aren't going to do well,"" said Erin Gibbs, portfolio manager for S&P Global Market Intelligence. ""This is concern that the economy is actually doing much better than expected and so we need to re-evaluate,"" she said. What has driven the Dow's surge? Stronger global growth has prompted central banks in Europe, Canada and elsewhere to ease away from policies put in place to stimulate the economy after the financial crisis. Analysts say investors should be prepared for choppier stock markets in the months ahead. But the Dow closed Monday having shed about a third of its gains since Mr Trump took office in January 2017. It marks a dramatic turnaround from January, whenit raced past the 25,000 and 26,000 point milestonesin less than a month. Joel Prakken, chief US economist for IHS Markit, predicts share price gains will be limited over the next two years. But he added that markets would need to deteriorate more significantly for him to start to worry about the broader economy. ""The difference between this year and last year is we're going to see more periods of volatility like this as the market reacts to higher inflation,"" he said. ""We're just not used to it because it's been so long since we've had a significant correction."" Investors have been bracing for a downturn after months of seemingly unstoppable gains. Amid the market plunge on Monday, websites for several large money management companies suffered slowdowns or crashes. Wall Street firms also said they have been fielding calls from people worried about their investments. Jerome Powell was sworn in as the new chairman of the US Federal Reserve on Monday Boasting about stock market gains is a dangerous game that most presidents avoid playing. Barack Obama did it occasionally, but only after the US economy had climbed significantly from the wreckage of the 2008 collapse. After warning of a market bubble during the campaign, however, Donald Trump became the Dow Jones's biggest cheerleader- in tweets, at rallies and even during last week's State of the Union address. That set up the jarring visual of the president boasting about the benefits of his tax cuts in a speech as the markets headed south. US cable news channels, which had been airing the president live, cut into their coverage to report on the record-setting day. It was a highly visible hiccup in the recent US economic success story that will be hard for most Americans to miss. The president will make the case that the fundamentals in the economy are still strong. Wages are up and unemployment is down - possibly contributing to stock drop. If growth continues, this could be chalked up as yet another rhetorical mis-step by a non-politician. If it's the beginning of a larger correction in an election year, however, the president's words could come back to haunt him.

"What's in a word? Number 10 will have cheered some of their Brexit backing troops this morning by ruling out, (again), staying in the customs union. This time they have, for good measure and just to be clear, ruled out not just staying in 'the' customs union, but also remaining in 'a' customs union. This might sound bonkers to you, but the inclusion of 'a' as a mere possibility had given hope to some MPs that the government was open to the idea of essentially replicating the current arrangements and calling it something else. An explicit reminder in those terms therefore will be a frustration to that group which have been pushing for a softer approach. In political terms therefore, it is an important signal at the beginning of an important week. UK will leave customs union, No 10 insists UK proposes 'untested' customs system Brexit: All you need to know What Sunday's late night statement is not, however, is anything like a new explanation of what the government actually wants to do. It does not mean that there will definitely be a border on the island of Ireland. It does not mean definitely that there will suddenly be vast lorry parks across the whole of Kent or around the ports at Hull or Holyhead. The government's overall aims remain the same - no hard border, and trade that is as frictionless as possible after Brexit. But there are emerging signs of the 'c' - the compromise that Theresa May will try to broker with her party, and her cabinet colleagues in the coming weeks to establish the government's actual position. That is, before of course, Brussels and 27 other countries either say ""oui"", ""non"", or ""peut-etre"". Back in the summerthe UK set out two broad possibilities. The fault line that Theresa May needs to walk carefully over this week is between those in her cabinet who want to crack on as fast as possible with agreeing trade deals with other countries, and those who put the preservation of the existing arrangements above that. As we saw last week on her trade trip to China, the prime minister does not want to accept publicly that one of these choices trumps the other. But as her colleagues who toured the broadcast studios yesterday displayed, there are divisions in the Tory party over who wants what, so there does have to be compromise. There are whispers around,as The Times,externalreports, that putting a time limit on to some of the existing arrangements could provide a way through. Interestingly, that's the approach that eventually found favour between Westminster and Brussels over another of the points of contention. The UK accepted that the European courts would continue to have a role in enforcing the rights of EU nationals who live in the UK, but for a time-limited period of 8 years. That gave the PM enough wriggle room to contain the wishes of the rest of the EU and her party. Senior figures in Number 10 suggested then the idea of putting time limits could be a useful precedent for other parts of the deal. This could, perhaps, therefore provide one of the routes out of this tangled part of the Brexit talks. But there are still weeks and months of talking ahead to do.

"The Dow sank by nearly 1.4% on Tuesday The blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average suffered its steepest decline since June 2016 on Friday, amid wider losses in US markets. The fall came after a string of disappointing earnings reports from giants such as Apple. Strong wage growth in the latest payrolls data also spooked investors raising the possibility of higher interest rates than expected. The Dow fell more than 665 points or 2.5% to 25,520.96. The S&P 500 tumbled 59.8 points, falling 2.12% to 2,762.13, while the Nasdaq closed 144.91 points lower at 7,240.9, down 1.96%. The losses touched every sector, with the steepest declines in energy and technology stocks. Chevron and Exxon, which both reported quarterly earnings to investors on Friday, were the two biggest losers on the Dow, falling more than 5%. Apple, which reported after the close of trading on Thursday, was number four, retreating 4.3%. Stocks were also rattled as the yield on the 10-year Treasury note hit a four-year high after Friday's payrolls report. The gain in bond yields, which come as central banks globally ease stimulus programmes and raise rates, have touched off fears that stocks could become a less attractive investment, while signalling higher borrowing costs that could crimp consumer activity. Analysts said markets may also be responding to outstanding political and policy issues, such as trade tensions with partners such as China and how tax cuts will shift corporate financial strategies. ""There are still a number of question marks on the side of fiscal policy,"" said Lindsey Piezga, chief economist at Stifel Fixed Income. For the week, the Dow fell 4%, while the Nasdaq and S&P 500 each slipped by more than 3%. Analysts cautioned against reading too much into the market declines, which follow a massive rally in 2017 that was fuelled by a strengthening global economy and high expectations for US corporate tax cuts. The three major stocks indexes also closed January up more than 5%. The Dow, which tracks about 30 major companies, in particular is not a good gauge, said Brian Barnier, head of analytics at Valuebridge Advisers. ""It's very important to separate trading activity from real investing activity,"" said Mr Barnier, who also teaches at the Colin Powell School at the City College of New York. Assuming they have well-designed portfolios, ""mom and pops sitting at home... should not be concerned, given the massive run up in the market,"" he added.

"If last week is anything to go by, we can expect a lot of sound and fury over the next few days about Brexit debates within the cabinet, the government and the Conservative Party. Demands for the government to clarify its ambitions for the UK's long-term relationship with the EU continue to grow. And this raises the question of how long creative ambiguity for the purpose of negotiation (if that is what it is) can continue. Not much longer is a fair assumption - not least because in two months' time businesses will suddenly find themselves entering the financial year in which Brexit is due to happen. Plans need to be put in place. UK will leave customs union, No 10 insists What are the UK's trade options? Customs deal: what the UK wants The EU has already emphasised on numerous occasions that until it has a clearer idea of the UK position (beyond the desire for a ""deep and special partnership""), negotiations on the future can't really begin. But that doesn't mean there isn't plenty going on, and plenty to do, in the meantime. In that spirit, another round of negotiations is taking place in Brussels this week. To begin with, the agreement reached in December that ""sufficient progress"" had been made on a series of ""divorce"" issues still needs to be turned into a viable legal text - a withdrawal agreement that would have to be signed and ratified before the UK leaves the EU, on 29 March 2019. You'll remember the main issues involved: the future status of the Irish border a financial settlement or ""divorce bill"" future rights of EU citizens in the UK and UK citizens elsewhere in Europe The Irish border has emerged as the most difficult issue to resolve - a dilemma encapsulated in the argument surrounding ""the"", ""a"" or even ""an"" customs union. Staying in any kind of customs union would not in itself ensure that the border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic would remain as invisible as it is at the moment. There's a goodexplanation of that here. But the future customs relationship has become a bit of a lightning rod for a host of other issues. The government says it wants a new bespoke customs arrangement, without providing a huge amount of detail about how it can be achieved. Some kind of deal on the Irish border needs to be done, though, before the withdrawal agreement can be finalised. At the same time, intensive negotiations on a transition period for up to two years after Brexit are about to begin. (Yes we know - just to confuse matters still further, the government prefers to call it an implementation period.) The EU's guidelines for the negotiations on transition stipulate that it will take place under all existing EU rules and regulations, although the UK will no longer have any say in making them. The UK will however be able to start negotiating (although not implementing) its own trade deals around the world. The government has broadly signed up to the terms of transition, but it wants a few exceptions built in to the system. That suggests that it may not be quite as easy as both sides hope to finalise the transition negotiations at a European summit in March. Once again, there is political pressure coming from all sides. Brexiteers fear that the transition will turn the UK into a ""vassal state"", while the government says it will give businesses more time to plan for the future. But what will the future actually look like? Negotiations on that haven't even begun yet: the other 27 EU countries are still considering their joint position while they wait for more clarity from London. Above all, they want to know more detail about the kind of trade relationship the UK hopes to have. Will it remain closely aligned with EU rules and regulations? Will it try to forge its own path? Or - as seems likely - will it try to negotiate a mixture of the two? The EU is already warning against ""cherry-picking"" the best bits. There are also a host of other areas in which the UK cooperates closely with the EU - security and policing, for example, and foreign policy - new relationships need to be negotiated there too. So ""plenty to do"" is perhaps putting it mildly - no wonder the EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, said on Monday there wasn't a minute to lose. Unravelling an intricate relationship that has developed over more than 40 years was never going to be easy. But difficult decisions can't be put off much longer.

"A trader works on the floor at the closing bell of the Dow Industrial Average at the New York Stock Exchange on December 29, 2017 in New York. Global stock markets are closing out a blockbuster year. In the US, the S&P 500 topped 2,670, rising more than 400 points or about 19% over the year. Japan's Nikkei also gained nearly 20%. Even the UK's FTSE indexes hit record highs, ending the year more than 7% ahead. As Morgan Stanley analysts put it, for shareholders at least, the year has been ""absurdly good"". So what drove the growth and will it continue? Here are some factors to consider in 2018. The global economy is forecast to grow, but growth is expected to slow in some regions A major driver of stock market growth in 2017 was a booming global economy that surpassed expectations. Will the growth continue? Forecasters say basically, yes. TheOECD,externalis predicting 3.7% growth in 2018, up from 3.6% this year. IHS Markit,externalexpects growth of about 3.2%, while the forecasts ofBank of America Merrill Lynch,externalandGoldman Sachs,externalare a bit rosier at 3.8% and 4%, respectively. One boost will come from the US, where many economists expect new tax cuts to provide a temporary economic jolt, with forecasts for GDP growth of about 2.5%. The increase is expected to translate into stock market gains, although less than in 2017. Morgan Stanley predicts the S&P 500 will reach 2,750 in 2018.Bank of America Merrill Lynch,externalexpects it could hit 2,800, while Goldman Sachs forecasts a rise to 2,850 as corporate profits climb. IMF forecasts stronger global growth Eurozone growth exceeds expectations ""While there are potential pitfalls in store for 2018, the weight of the evidence as we move toward the New Year remains bullish,"" Baird analysts wrote in a December report. In some regions, however, it may prove hard to beat the prior year. Economists expect growth in China to slow, and say it will be difficult for Europe to match its 2017 expansion, which was the fastest in a decade. In the UK,PwC,externalpredicts GDP growth will slow to 1.4%, whileMoody's Analytics,externalpredicts 1.3% growth. The tax overhaul, which will slash corporate rates, is a victory for Republicans In the US, one factor boosting stocks in 2017 was optimism that Republicans would deliver corporate tax cuts - andthey did, passing the most significant overhaul of the US tax code in a generation. In 2018, we'll start to see how companies and consumers respond to the cuts. Will excess cash lead to a flurry of corporate mergers or new investment? Will multinationals adopt different tax strategies? Will revenue declines caused by the cuts lead politicians to slash US welfare programs, exacerbating the gap between rich and poor and stirring political tension? US tax bill: Winners and losers Trump tax cuts: Hereâs why they matter to us all Some analysts worry the stimulus will cause the economy to overheat, and lead the Federal Reserve to raise rates more aggressively than planned. Such a move, which comes as banks in other countries are also removing stimulus, could raise the risk of triggering a recession. But most economists aren't anticipating that will happen in 2018. ""With robust growth momentum and no major economic imbalances or other key recession risk indicators flashing red, we see no obvious reason why the expansion needs to end any time soon,"" Goldman Sachs analysts wrote this month. Negotiations over Nafta are expected to be resolved in 2018. The election of US President Donald Trump sparked fears of trade wars and increased protectionism. He took some steps in that direction in 2017, withdrawing the US from the Trans-Pacific Partnership and ramping up some disputes with Canada. It should become clearer in 2018 how much of his rhetoric will turn into reality, as negotiations over the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) come to a head. President Trump continues to threaten to scrap the deal, but he faces opposition from within his own party, as well as powerful business associations. ""There are extensive trade ties among the three North American economies, and an abrupt end of the agreement would impart adjustment costs on many businesses in the three countries,"" Wells Fargo analysts wrote. Officials hope to wrap up the discussions this spring before election campaigns in Mexico and the US get underway. Also pending is an investigation of intellectual property theft in China. Amazon is estimated to account for about 44% of all e-commerce sales in the US Technology giants - including big names such as Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google - powered US stock markets this year, while shaking up traditional sectors including car-makers, department stores, grocers, media giants, banks and advertisers. The tech firms, which are becoming increasingly global, are likely to remain strong stock picks in 2018, said Jill Hall, an equity strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. But the digital behemoths are also facing backlash over their increasing dominance, a groundswell spurred in part by concerns about crippling cyber breaches and the proliferation of fake news on the social media platforms. Will 2018 be the year when US regulators take action? In Europe, authorities have already stepped up enforcement of tax, privacy and competition rules. Scott Kessler of CFRA Research predicts additional action in Europe and possibly the US, yielding at least one more multi-billion dollar fine in 2018.

"This video can not be played A quick guide to Trump's NHS intervention US President Donald Trump has sparked a backlash from UK politicians by attacking the National Health Service. In a tweet criticising US Democrats pushing for a universal health system, he said ""thousands of people are marching"" in the UK because the NHS is ""going broke and not working"". This was believed to be a reference to a Save the NHS march on Downing Street on Saturday, demanding more funding. Downing Street said Theresa May was ""proud"" of the UK's system. Her spokesman said the NHS hadrecently been rankedas the world's best healthcare system and that Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, who has hit back at the US president on Twitter, ""speaks for the government"". Organisers of the demonstration said it had been aimed at showing people's ""love"" for the NHS. The chief executive of NHS England said the US president had ""got the wrong end of the stick"". 10 charts that show why the NHS is in trouble Call for new tax to fund the NHS Trump profile: The hotel developer who became president In the UK, the NHS is funded out of general taxation, so people do not have to pay when they get treatment. In the US, when people get treatment they have to pay, most often through health insurance providers. President Trump's tweet came after ex-UKIP leader Nigel Farage appeared on Fox And Friends, one of the president's favourite shows, talking about the weekend march. ""Dems want to greatly raise taxes for really bad and non-personal medical care,"" Mr Trump tweeted. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

In response, Mr Hunt said that while he ""disagreed with claims made on that march"", no-one wanted ""to live in a system where 28 million people have no cover"". He added: ""NHS may have challenges but I'm proud to be from the country that invented universal coverage - where all get care, no matter the size of their bank balance."" Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn - the leader of the UK opposition - also hit back, saying: ""People were marching because we love our NHS and hate what the Tories are doing to it."" He added: ""Healthcare is a human right."" Donald Trump has said that he doesn't watch much television, claiming once he was too busy ""reading documents"". Time and again, however, the president has praised and promoted specific Fox News programmes - particularly the cable network's morning offering, Fox and Friends. Such was the case on Monday, as the president tweeted about the National Health Service shortly after former UKIP leader Nigel Farage appeared on Fox to criticise the NHS during a segment on a recent London protest march. Healthcare reform, while a major topic of partisan debate in the US last year, has fallen off the radar recently. Republicans tried, and failed, to roll back government regulation of the insurance industry instituted by Barack Obama. In last week's State of the Union address, Mr Trump barely mentioned the topic. When Fox News catches the president's attention, however, that can change with the flick of a Twitter finger. NHS funding has been hotly debated in the UK as hospitals struggle to cope with the pressure on resources. A panel set up by the Liberal Democrats - the fourth largest party in the Commons - has called for a ring-fenced tax to fund the service, saying an extra Â£4bn is needed for next year and an additional Â£2.5bn for both 2019 and 2020. This video can not be played The rally included health workers, unions and NHS campaigners Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable urged the US president to read the study, ""to find out how to fund a universal healthcare system"". Saturday's demonstration, called NHS In Crisis: Fix It Now, was organised by the People's Assembly Against Austerity and Health Campaigns Together. In a joint response to the US president, they said people had marched ""to show their love for the principles of universal and comprehensive care free at the point of use, paid for through general taxation"". They added: ""We don't agree with your divisive and incorrect rhetoric."" Actor and NHS campaigner Ralf Little, who was at the march, told President Trump he was wrong about the reasons for the march. Allow Twitter content?

Simon Stevens, the chief executive of NHS England, responded during an appearance before a committee of MPs. ""President Trump has been tweeting about the National Health Service today, and unfortunately, respectfully, we suggest that tweet got the wrong end of the stick,"" he said. ""And, in fact, people in this country don't want to ditch our NHS, not withstanding what we've said today, they want to keep it and strengthen it,"" he said.

"This video can not be played Lauri Love: Alleged hacker hopes extradition case 'sets a precedent' Alleged computer hacker Lauri Love has won his High Court appeal against his extradition to the US. Mr Love, 33, from Stradishall, Suffolk, was first arrested in October 2013 on suspicion of hacking into FBI, US Central Bank and Nasa systems. Appeal judges said extradition,externalwould be ""oppressive by reason of his physical and mental condition"". They urged the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) to prosecute Mr Love, who has Aspergers syndrome, in England. Lord Chief Justice Lord Burnett and Mr Justice Ouseley said Mr Love, who also has depression, ""did not seek impunity for the acts alleged against him, but contended that he should be tried and, if convicted, sentenced in the United Kingdom"". Lauri Love attended the appeal hearing with his girlfriend Sylvia Mann They said: ""We accept that the evidence shows that the fact of extradition would bring on severe depression, and that Mr Love would probably be determined to commit suicide, here or in America."" Mr Love is alleged to have stolen huge amounts of data from US agencies, including the Federal Reserve, the US army, the defence department, Nasa and the FBI in a spate of online attacks in 2012 and 2013. However, his supporters had warned if he was extradited there was a ""high risk"" he would kill himself. The judges urged the Crown Prosecution Service to work with US authorities because of ""the gravity of the allegations in this case, and the harm done to the victims"". They added that ""if proven, these are serious offences indeed"". The United States authorities now have 14 days to lodge a request for an appeal hearing at the UK Supreme Court. 28 October 2013: Lauri Love isarrested in Suffolkunder the Computer Misuse Act and accused of breaching the security of Nasa and FBI, among other US government agencies. He is released on bail. 27 February 2014: Mr Love is accused of anew chargeof hacking into US Federal Reserve computer servers and stealing the personal information of users. 20 February 2015: Police in the UK say they will not return Mr Love's computer because theycannot decrypt its files. 16 July 2015: Mr Love isre-arrestedby the Met Police executing an extradition warrant on behalf of the US. 20 August 2015: Mr Love tells the BBC he fears he willnot get a fair trialin the US. 10 May 2016: A bid by the National Crime Agency to force Mr Love to hand over encrypted computer passwords isthrown out by a district judgeat Westminster Magistrates' Court. 6 September 2016: Mr Love tells the BBC hefears dying in jail if he is extradited. 16 September 2016: A judge at Westminster Magistrates' Court rules Mr Love should be extradited to the US. 24 October 2016: MPs sign a letter asking President Obama toblock Mr Love's extradition. 14 November 2016: Home Secretary Amber Rudd signs theextradition order. 29 November 2017: The Court of Appealbegins hearing Mr Love's appeal against extradition. Speaking outside the court, Mr Love said he hoped he had set a ""precedent so this will not happen to people in the future"". ""I'm hoping that this outcome can contribute to the discussion we are having as a society about how to accommodate people that have neuro-diversity, whose brains are made up in a slightly different way,"" he said. ""There is an ongoing problem with people with autism in the justice system - they have actually been debating it in Westminster Hall. ""I hope in the future to be able to contribute to a slightly better understanding of the stigma associated with depression.""

What makes Great Britain great is that we live in a place with wisdom and compassion."" Authorities in the US have been fighting for Mr Love to face trial on charges of cyber-hacking, which lawyers have said could have meant a sentence of up to 99 years in prison if he was found guilty. The decision to block extradition was met with cheers in the packed London courtroom. A spokesman for Mr Love's solicitors, Kaim Todner, said it was ""important"" the British justice system ""has taken the stance that we should deal with the matter ourselves, rather than accept the US government's demands"". The United States authorities now have 14 days to lodge a request for an appeal hearing at the UK Supreme Court ""It has also been recognised that mental health provisions in US prisons are not adequate to satisfy us that Lauri would not have come to serious harm if he were extradited,"" the statement added. Emma Norton, head of legal casework for campaign group Liberty, said she was ""delighted"" the court had ""recognised Lauri's vulnerability, close family connections to the UK and the potentially catastrophic consequences of extraditing him"". She added: ""This was always a case that could have been prosecuted here and it's shameful that Lauri and his family have been put through this terrible ordeal."" Mr Love's local MP Matt Hancock said: ""It has been a long and hard process for him and his loving family and I'm delighted this verdict has been reached.""

"US stocks suffered their worst falls in more than six years on Monday in a sell-off sparked by concerns of higher interest rates. The Dow Jones Industrial Average index tumbled 1,175 points, or 4.6% to close down at 24,345.75. The White House moved to reassure investors saying it was focused on ""long-term economic fundamentals, which remain exceptionally strong"". Signs of improvement in the economy had driven US markets to record highs. Ever since he was elected in November 2016 President Donald Trump has tweeted a number of times about the increase in US stock markets, using the gains since he took office to illustrate market improvement. ""Economic news from the US has been stronger than anticipated,"" said David Kuo, chief executive of financial services advisory Motley Fool. ""So, perversely, the market correction has been caused by positive economic news"". Monday's decline is the largest decline in percentage terms for the Dow since August 2011, when markets dropped in the aftermath of ""Black Monday"" - the day Standard & Poor's downgraded its credit rating of the US. The drop on the Dow was closely followed by the wider S&P 500 stock index, down 4.1% and the technology-heavy Nasdaq, which lost 3.7%. In London, the FTSE 100 index of leading companies also fell to close down 1.46% or 108 points lower. In Tuesday's early Asian trade, stocks were following Wall Street's lead. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 sank 4.8% before recovering slightly, while Australia's benchmark S&P/ASX 200 was down 2.7%. In South Korea, the Kospi lost 2.3%. Asian markets are following Wall Street's lead - but why? Investors are reacting to changes in the outlook for the American and global economy, and what that might mean for the cost of borrowing. The stock market sell-off accelerated on Friday when the US Labour Department released employment numbers which showed stronger growth in wages than was anticipated. CMC Markets analyst Michael McCarthy said the wage numbers ""blew lower interest rates out of the water"". ""The share selling....reflects a higher than previously anticipated interest rate environment,"" Mr McCarthy said. US jobs and wages rise in January The US economy in six charts In response to that, investors moved to sell out of stocks and put money into assets like bonds which benefit from higher interest rates. ""This isn't a collapse of the economy. This isn't a concern that markets aren't going to do well,"" said Erin Gibbs, portfolio manager for S&P Global Market Intelligence. ""This is concern that the economy is actually doing much better than expected and so we need to re-evaluate,"" she said. What has driven the Dow's surge? Stronger global growth has prompted central banks in Europe, Canada and elsewhere to ease away from policies put in place to stimulate the economy after the financial crisis. Analysts say investors should be prepared for choppier stock markets in the months ahead. But the Dow closed Monday having shed about a third of its gains since Mr Trump took office in January 2017. It marks a dramatic turnaround from January, whenit raced past the 25,000 and 26,000 point milestonesin less than a month. Joel Prakken, chief US economist for IHS Markit, predicts share price gains will be limited over the next two years. But he added that markets would need to deteriorate more significantly for him to start to worry about the broader economy. ""The difference between this year and last year is we're going to see more periods of volatility like this as the market reacts to higher inflation,"" he said. ""We're just not used to it because it's been so long since we've had a significant correction."" Investors have been bracing for a downturn after months of seemingly unstoppable gains. Amid the market plunge on Monday, websites for several large money management companies suffered slowdowns or crashes. Wall Street firms also said they have been fielding calls from people worried about their investments. Jerome Powell was sworn in as the new chairman of the US Federal Reserve on Monday Boasting about stock market gains is a dangerous game that most presidents avoid playing. Barack Obama did it occasionally, but only after the US economy had climbed significantly from the wreckage of the 2008 collapse. After warning of a market bubble during the campaign, however, Donald Trump became the Dow Jones's biggest cheerleader- in tweets, at rallies and even during last week's State of the Union address. That set up the jarring visual of the president boasting about the benefits of his tax cuts in a speech as the markets headed south. US cable news channels, which had been airing the president live, cut into their coverage to report on the record-setting day. It was a highly visible hiccup in the recent US economic success story that will be hard for most Americans to miss. The president will make the case that the fundamentals in the economy are still strong. Wages are up and unemployment is down - possibly contributing to stock drop. If growth continues, this could be chalked up as yet another rhetorical mis-step by a non-politician. If it's the beginning of a larger correction in an election year, however, the president's words could come back to haunt him.

"The UK Statistics Authority has backed First Minister Carwyn Jones's criticism of Prime Minister Theresa May's use of accident and emergency data. Mr Jones said a comparison of those waiting 12 hours or more at A&E in Wales and England was unfair as the figures are measured in different ways. Authority chairman Sir David Norgrove said the comparison was ""not valid"". A spokesman for Mrs May accepted the assessment but insisted A&E performance in England was better than Wales. Sir David said: ""The figure used for England refers to the accident and emergency wait time from the decision to admit to admission into another part of the health service. ""The figure used for Wales represents the entire time patients wait from arriving to leaving accident and emergency services, including the time from decision to admit to actual admission."" Objection to NHS statistics 'misuse' When challenged by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn about the NHS earlier in January, Theresa May said the latest figures showed 497 people waiting more than 12 hours in A&E at hospitals in England compared to 3,741 in Wales. But that prompted a letter from Carwyn Jones, who said the English figures would ""not include any of the time which the patient has spent in A&E prior to the decision to admit being taken"". He said: ""The selective misuse of statistics like this does not allow for a fair debate on the NHS."" In reply, Sir David said: ""You are right to say that the comparison is not valid. ""Waiting time comparisons between UK countries are difficult, for a variety of reasons, including differences in data collection and in health service structure, the use of walk-in centres for example."" He did, however, urge ""faster progress"" in making data accessible and comparable. ""It is clearly important to be able to compare health and social care service performance across the UK, particularly to learn lessons from different ways of doing things,"" he said. A spokesman for the prime minister said: ""We would accept the assessment of the UK Stats Authority - but the point she was making, that A&E performed better in England than in Wales, still stands"".

"This video can not be played Who are the Hatton Garden masterminds? One of the Â£14m Hatton Garden jewellery raiders, Terry Perkins, has died in prison aged 69. Perkins from Enfield, north London, was serving a jail term for the ""largest burglary in English legal history"". One of four ringleaders of the 2015 raid, he was last week ordered to pay back Â£6,526,571 or face a further seven-year jail term. Perkins and his fellow raiders stole goods after drilling into a vault at London's Hatton Garden Safe Deposit. He was serving his sentence in HMP Belmarsh and is believed to have been ill for some time. In a statement, the Prison Service said: ""As with all deaths in custody, there will be an independent investigation by the Prisons and Probation Ombudsman."" Who were the jewellery heist raiders? In pictures: How the Hatton Garden plot played out Ringleaders ordered to pay Â£27.5m Perkins was jailed for seven years, alongside two of the ringleaders, John ""Kenny"" Collins, 77, and Daniel Jones, 63,after pleading guilty to conspiracy to commit burglary in 2016. Fellow ringleader Brian Reader, 78, who was too ill to attend the initial sentencing, was later jailed for six years and three months. Terry Perkins was one of four ringleaders who carried out the raid in 2015 Last Tuesday, thegang members were ordered to pay back Â£27.5mbetween them or have their sentences increased. Judge Christopher Kinch QC said the men jointly benefitted from an estimated Â£13.69m worth of stolen cash, gold and gems. Peter Rowlands, Perkins' barrister, said his client - who had been diagnosed with ""severe heart failure"" - would have to serve the extra time as there was ""no prospect"" of any further funds being recovered. During last week's hearing, the judge said if any of the four could raise Â£6.4m to pay back, the others would each have that total taken off their confiscation order. If that were the case it would bring the total amount paid back by the burglars to about Â£8.2m. The vault at Hatton Garden Safe Deposit Ltd was breached over the 2015 Easter weekend Perkins was caught after Hatton Garden investigators installed a listening device in his blue Citroen Saxo, on which he was recorded  saying he planned to use his share of the spoils to fund his pension. He was arrested with Collins and Jones, having dropped off a holdall containing some of the loot. Perkins celebrated his birthday during the raid and was involved in all stages of the operation, including disposing of the stolen goods. He was inside the Hatton Garden building posing as a builder and ""working"" inside the lift on 31 March during the raid, which was carried out over the Easter weekend in 2015. When his home was searched police found jewellery, cash, blue workman's overalls and five pairs of white fabric gloves that were used by the burglars who aimed to leave no forensic evidence at the scene.

"This video can not be played ""My child died from it"": One mum on the prescription painkiller being taken to get a high Little more than a year ago Michelle Fraser knew nothing about fentanyl. Now she knows a lot: that the drug is a synthetic opioid related to heroin but more powerful; that it is a prescription drug used for cancer patients and others suffering severe pain; and that it is increasingly being used as a recreational drug. She also knows that fentanyl is a killer. It took the life of her 18-year-old son, Robert. ""I got a phone call from my ex-husband to say he had found Robert dead in bed and I remember thinking, 'He hasn't said that, he can't have said that - it's not true,'"" Michelle, from Deal in Kent, says. Robert's mum Michelle Fraser said drug dealers were ""playing Russian Roulette with our lives"" Robert had died of a fentanyl overdose. He had been given the drug by a dealer when he had gone with friends to buy cannabis. Michelle is convinced that Robert had no idea that he was taking fentanyl - or how dangerous it could be. ""Fentanyl is a killer and the drug dealers are playing Russian Roulette with our livesâ¦ my child died from it,"" she says. At the Eurofins Forensic Services laboratory in south-west London, they know all about the dangers of fentanyl. And of carfetanil - a related drug developed as a large animal tranquiliser. Just a few grains can be enough to kill. And it can be absorbed through the skin, or simply breathed in. The laboratory's forensic scientists have to work in pairs with the antidote to fentanyl close at hand. They test for the drug in specialised extractor cabinets which remove particles from the air and they wear disposable lab coats, double gloves and face masks. The laboratory has, for decades, analysed drugs for the police and the CPS to provide evidence in court. Lethal doses of heroin, fentanyl and carfentanil Forensic scientist Peter Cain says: ""Fentanyls are a different category of drug altogether. ""And the potential harm they could cause is just way above anything we have had in the past. ""It's the potency of them that is what's frightening."" So where is this dangerous, deadly drug coming from? Most of the supply in the UK is produced in China and then secretly shipped to the UK where users buy it through the dark web. The BBC went undercover in China to get at least part of the answer. After weeks of negotiations through messaging apps, we were invited to a meeting in an ordinary tearoom in a city in northern China. Here we met a young manager from a laboratory which makes research chemicals. He's with his translator. The conversation was stilted and slowed down by the language barrier but the message was very clear. They have brought samples of drugs made by the family firm. No fentanyl, of course, as it is too dangerous for this public place. The laws in China mean some labs can make certain types of fentanyl legally. The issue is who they are prepared to sell it to. Within minutes we were offered a deal. Quickly we learned that fentanyl was freely available, no questions asked, with an offer to ship it out to the UK: A class A drug readily available for the international criminal market. It would be packed up and sent discretely by mail or courier. The BBC left without making an order. No drugs were bought. The reason drug dealers are attracted to fentanyl over, say, heroin, is that it is so strong - a little goes a long way. It is a cheap alternative which can be sent in small packages. From China, and other places where fentanyl is produced, the dealers must, eventually, get the drug into the hands of those who choose to use it. Often, the last link in the chain is the so-called dark web. Most of the fentanyl supply in the UK is produced in China and then shipped to the UK where users buy it through the dark web Author Jamie Bartlett researches and writes about this unregulated part of the internet. He has logged on to a website that looks like any other online marketing site. Except in this case, we are offered heroin, morphine and fentanyl. Jamie says: ""It turns everything into a very professional sort of transaction and it just feels like: 'I will go onto my computer, get a few drugs delivered to my house and don't even think too much of it.' ""I think people who spend a lot of time on these markets can lose touch with what they're actually doing. ""They don't realise quite how serious or strong some of these drugs are and the severity of the crimes they're committing, because it feels like you are on a normal website doing a normal bit of business."" Fentanyl has also been sold on the street. Across the north east of England, in the early part of 2017, heroin suppliers started secretly mixing fentanyl with their usual supplies in order to increase profits. There was a surge in overdoses in the region. In Teeside at least six people died. Kenny almost became the seventh. Kenny survived a fentanyl overdose because the antidote was at hand. He has a long history of heroin abuse but his body was simply overwhelmed when he injected what the dealer had sold him. ""I was using what I thought was heroin and turns out it wasn't,"" he says. ""It was fentanyl or carfentanil. ""I overdosed - that is as much as I can remember. Injected it and overdosed. I was dead. ""I'd gotten about halfway down and I was just seeing red and that is the last I remember. ""It was like blood was covering my eyes."" Kenny survived only because he overdosed at a drop-in centre run by the Moses Project, which had taken the precaution of having the antidote to fentanyl. The spike of deaths across the north east of England put fentanyl firmly on the radar of the National Crime Agency. The drug has killed 113 people in the UK since 2016. Laurence Gibbons, the NCA's head of drugs threat, says the agency has prioritised the threat from the drug and its analogues. ""We have a number of officers working solely on that threat and they will continue monitoring and we will keep a good watch on what is emerging,"" he says. Twenty-five-year-oldKyle Enos, from Newport, south Wales, was jailed for eight years on Mondayfor exporting and selling fentanyl using the dark web. This is believed to be only the second case of its kind in the UK. Kyle Enos was jailed for eight years on Monday for exporting and selling fentanyl Meanwhile, Robert's mum is left with mementos, photos and videos that show a smiling young man with his whole life ahead of him. Every day Michelle walks to the seafront in her hometown, Deal. There's a bench there with a plaque in Robert's memory. As she sits and looks out over the English Channel, Michelle takes time to reflect on the dangers of fentanyl, and how best to protect other young people, including her own younger son. ""People are sitting in their bedrooms and clicking a button and getting it,"" she says. ""The world I grew up in wasn't like that and don't want that future for my little lad, my surviving lad.""

He was inside the Hatton Garden building posing as a builder and ""working"" inside the lift on 31 March during the raid, which was carried out over the Easter weekend in 2015. When his home was searched police found jewellery, cash, blue workman's overalls and five pairs of white fabric gloves that were used by the burglars who aimed to leave no forensic evidence at the scene.

"Stagecoach's contract to run the East Coast Mainline rail franchise will end earlier than expected after the government said the operator had ""got its numbers wrong"". Transport Secretary Chris Grayling said Stagecoach would continue running the London to Edinburgh line only for ""a small number of months and no more"". He said the government may step in to run the service. He added that the day-to-day operation of the line would be unaffected. The East Coast Mainline franchise was taken into public ownership in 2009 after being run by National Express. It was reprivatised when Stagecoach and Virgin signed a deal to run the East Coast line from 2015 to 2023, promising to pay the government Â£3.3bn to run the service. Stagecoach owns 90% of the joint venture and Virgin owns the remaining 10%. In November, the Department for Transport said Stagecoach and Virgin would withdraw from running the service three years early, in 2020, after running into difficulties. But on Monday Mr Grayling told the House of Commons the situation was now ""much more urgent"" and that new arrangements were needed ""in the very near future"". Mr Grayling said he was considering two approaches. One option was to allow Stagecoach to continue operating the franchise on a short-term and not-for-profit basis until a new contract is awarded in 2020. Alternatively, East Coast Mainline could be brought back under government control and be run by the Department for Transport through an operator of last resort. Mr Grayling said: ""The problem is that Stagecoach got its numbers wrong. It overbid and is now paying a price."" East Coast decision investigated by watchdog 'Indefensible' deal over East Coast rail Plan to fix 'creaking' railways unveiled by government Labour former transport secretary Lord Adonis accused Mr Grayling of ""undertaking another unjustified bailout of Virgin and Stagecoach at the expense of taxpayers"". He said: ""The reason for these disgraceful bailouts we've been seeing from Mr Grayling is because he simply is not prepared to contemplate putting his duty above ideology and substituting for failing private companies a state company."" However Mr Grayling insisted that there was ""no question of a bailout"" for the company, adding: ""Stagecoach will be held to all of its contractual obligations in full."" He said Stagecoach was set to lose about Â£200m, equating to more than 20% of its total market value. Mr Grayling said: ""It should also act as a stark warning to any company tempted to over-bid in future."" At the same time, Mr Grayling also announced that another joint venture between Stagecoach and Virgin had won an extension to operate the West Coast Mainline rail service between London and Glasgow. He said that this joint venture will operate the West Coast Mainline from 1 April 2018 until potentially 31 March 2020. A Stagecoach subsidiary is also on the shortlist of bidders hoping to operate the East Midlands franchise, scheduled to begin in August 2019. Shadow transport secretary Andy McDonald said: ""That Chris Grayling awarded a profitable contract to Virgin and Stagecoach on the West Coast while simultaneously confirming the same companies have collapsed on the East Coast shows Government policy is in chaos. ""This is yet another Tory handout to private shareholders at the public's expense. Failing train companies should not be awarded future contracts, but this government is rewarding them for failure by extending their lucrative deal."" Mick Whelan, leader of the train drivers' union Aslef, said: ""It is outrageous that Virgin Trains has been handed a lucrative new contract to run services on the West Coast Mainline despite serious criticism of its owners' handling of the East Coast franchise."" Stagecoach Group Chief Executive Martin Griffiths said: ""A lot has been said and written in the past few months about Virgin Trains East Coast - a lot of it has been misinformed and much of it has been politically motivated."" He said Stagecoach and Virgin had delivered for passengers, employees and the economy including generating payments to the taxpayer of more than Â£800m. ""The reality is that we've neither walked away from the East Coast franchise  nor have we received or asked for any special treatment,"" he said. There are no legal grounds to prevent Stagecoach from bidding for current or future franchises, Mr Grayling told the Commons.

"Up to 40 Homebase stores could be closed by its Australian owner, putting up to 2,000 jobs at risk. Wesfarmers paid Â£340m for the DIY chain in early 2016 and has been rebranding the stores under the Bunnings name. But after a ""disappointing"" performance the Australian firm has put Homebase under review and expects it to lose Â£97m in the first half of 2018. UK retailers are struggling in the face of rising inflation and fragile consumer confidence. Several store chains have announced job cuts recently, including supermarket giants Tesco, Sainsbury's and Asda. Homebase's rival, B&Q, last week said it was cutting 200 jobs at its head office in Hampshire as part of a cost-cutting drive. Homebase bought by Australia's Wesfarmers B&Q to cut 200 head office jobs Wesfarmers said it had written down the value of the Homebase chain by Â£454m as a result of its poor trading. ""The Homebase acquisition has been below our expectations which is obviously disappointing,"" Wesfarmers managing director Rob Scott said. Richard Hyman, retail analyst at RAH Advisory, said: ""The DIY sector benefits from a reasonably buoyant housing market, which we haven't had for some time."" However, this was very well known to Wesfarmers, who paid a ""crazy price"" for Homebase, he said. But Mr Hyman said that Wesfarmers' strategy of improving service levels and cutting down on promotions was introduced too quickly, although it could still work in the long term. Wesfarmers admitted it has found the UK market ""very different and more fragmented"" than Australia, according to Hugh Dive, chief investment officer at Atlas Funds Management. Wesfarmers' shares fell by up to 5% in Australian trading. However, shares in Kingfisher, which owns rival DIY chain B&Q, rose 3%. Analysts said B&Q could benefit, if Homebase closes significant numbers of stores. Another quoted rival, Travis Perkins, which owns Wickes, saw a modest 0.5% rise. Homebase has 250 stores across the UK and employs 12,000 people. Wesfarmers will announce the result of its review in June, so staff will have to wait until then to find out which stores are to close. However, the Australian firm said it had been encouraged by the performance of stores that had begun trading under the Bunnings name.

"Bars were fitted to the benches to deter people from lying on them A council has said it will remove ""anti-homeless"" bars from benches after receiving ""extensive feedback"". Protestors including rapper Professor Green condemned the bars as ""inhumane"", ""brutal"" and ""disgraceful"". Bournemouth Borough Council said it had fitted the devices to stop people lying on the benches and preventing others from sitting down. It said it would remove them in the next few days, in the light of ""the depth of feeling"" over the issue. More than 19,500 people signed an online petition calling for the bars to be taken off. The housing charity Crisis said the benches were a ""sad indictment"" and failed to ""address the root causes of rough sleeping"". Mum covers anti-homeless spikes with cushions Homeless would risk Â£1k fine in tent ban plan Rough sleeping in England rises for seventh year Professor Green, who last year fronted aBBC documentary on homelessness,said the benches sent a hostile message to ""poor sods with no safety net"". In a social media post, he said: ""Nothing done to tackle the problem, just something to make it more invisible so we can pretend it isn't happening."" Protestors festooned the 28 benches with throws, cushions and balloons on Monday The council said Â£3,650 was spent fitting the bars On Monday, protestorsfestooned the 28 benches with throws, cushions and balloons. Bournemouth Borough Council later announced its change of heart. Councillor Robert Lawton said: ""The decision last summer to install the bars on a very small number of benches... was taken in response to many complaints about people lying on them throughout the day. ""However we have listened to the extensive feedback over the last week and in light of the depth of feeling, have today reviewed that decision and agreed to have the bars removed."" Artist Stuart Semple, who prompted the protests byposting a photo of a bench in January, said he was delighted. ""We're totally over the moon, it's brilliant... It just really goes to show when the community comes together, gets behind something and keeps the pressure up.""

"Pope Francis's trip to Chile and Peru was overshadowed by the row A victim of a paedophile priest in Chile has revealed he wrote to the Pope in 2015 about an alleged cover-up after Francis denied getting evidence. Juan Carlos Cruz, a victim of cleric Fernando Karadima in the 1980s, accused fellow priest Juan Barros of witnessing the abuse and doing nothing. The Pope caused outrage after a visit to Chile last month by defending Bishop Barros. The Vatican refused to comment on the letter when approached by BBC News. Pope Francis has said in the past that dealing with abuse is vital for the Church's credibility and  perpetrators must face ""sanctions"". Profile: Pope Francis Mr Cruz sent the text of his letter (written in Spanish) to BBC News, showing it was addressed personally to Pope Francis and dated 3 March 2015. That was more than two weeks before the bishop's installation in the south Chilean city of Osorno, an event dramatically disrupted by hundreds ofprotesters accusing Bishop Barros of covering up Karadima's sex attacks on young boys. Juan Barros (centre) was greeted by angry protesters at his installation as bishop in the city of Osorno The bishop has denied ever knowing about ""the serious abuses"" committed by Karadima, who was never prosecuted in Chile because so much time had passed but was convicted and sentenced by the Vatican to a lifetime of ""penance and prayer"". ""Holy Father, I decided to write this letter to you because I'm tired of fighting, crying and suffering,"" Mr Cruz writes. ""Our story is well known and there's no point reminding you of it, except to tell you of the horror of having experienced this abuse and how I wanted to kill myself."" In his letter, he also attaches the full text of a previous letter written a month earlier to the Vatican's top diplomat in Chile, Archbishop Ivo Scapolo. In that letter, Mr Cruz accuses Bishop Barros of ""doing all the dirty work of Fernando Karadima"", and describes the abuse he suffered and which Bishop Barros allegedly witnessed. Karadima was only punished by the Vatican ""When we were in a room with Karadima and Juan Barros, if he [Barros] wasn't kissing Karadima, he watched as one of us, one of the younger ones, was touched by Karadima and forced to give him kisses,"" he writes. ""Karadima would say to me: 'Put your mouth next to mine and stick out your tongue.' He'd stick out his and kiss us with his tongue. Juan Barros witnessed all of this on countless occasions, not just in my case but in the case of others as well."" Addressing himself to Pope Francis, Mr Cruz says: ""Holy Father, Juan Barros says he saw nothing and yet, there are dozens of us who can testify to the fact that not only was he present when Karadima abused us, but that he, too, kissed Karadima and they touched each other."" He concludes the letter with this appeal: ""Please Holy Father, don't be like the others. There are so many of us who despite everything think that you can do something. I treasure my faith, it's what sustains me, but it is slipping away from me."" Among the Pope's remarks that caused such offence were: ""The day they bring me proof against Bishop Barros, then I will speak. There is not a single piece of proof against him. Everything is slander. Is this clear?"" He also said: ""No one has come forward, they haven't provided any evidence for a judgment. This is all a bit vague, it's something that can't be accepted."" The Pope later apologised for hurting victims' feelings ""without meaning to""but continued to insist there was ""no evidence"" against the bishop. ""In Barros's case, it was studied,"" he said. ""It was restudied. And there is no evidence... I don't have evidence to convict."" Members of the Pope's own Commission for the Protection of Minors, set up in 2014 as part of efforts to counter sex abuse by clergy, have told the Associated Press they hand-delivered the letter to Francis's top adviser,externalon sex abuse, Cardinal Sean O'Malley, in April 2015. Marie Collins, a member of the commission at the time, has sent the BBC a photo of her handing the letter to the cardinal. Marie Collins is shown here handing the letter to Cardinal O'Malley ""When we gave him the letter for the Pope, he assured us he would give it to the Pope and speak of the concerns,"" she told AP earlier. ""And at a later date, he assured us that that had been done."" Mr Cruz told the BBC that Cardinal O'Malley had called him later in 2015 to say he had given the letter to the Pope. Cardinal O'Malley, whose spokesman referred requests for comment to the Vatican, has earned respect for his work in tackling sex abuse by clergy in Boston. Cardinal O'Malley's disgraced predecessor, the late Cardinal Bernard Law, had moved paedophile priests between parishes rather than addressing victims' claims. In an unusual step, Cardinal O'Malley openly criticised the Pope last month for his initial remarks in Chile, saying he had left victims feeling abandoned. Pope Francis announced last week he was sending the Vatican's top expert on sexual abuse,  Archbishop Charles Scicluna, to Chileto investigate the accusations against Bishop Barros.

"Ethan Stables searched online about going on a ""killing spree"" A white supremacist who plotted a machete attack on people at a gay pride event has been convicted of a terror offence. Ethan Stables, 20, planned to strike at the LGBT event at the New Empire pub in Barrow, Cumbria, in June 2017. He claimed he posted comments on Facebook to impress far-right friends and was ""ashamed"" as he was bisexual. Stables was found guilty of preparing an act of terrorism, threats to kill and possessing explosives. Leeds Crown Court heard he was planning to use an axe and machete during the attack, but the plan was foiled after he told people about it on Facebook. Bisexual terrorist who hated himself Officers received a tip-off from a member of a far right group, where he posted a message saying he was ""going to war"" and planned to ""slaughter"". Armed police swooped on him as he walked towards the pub just before the event. The court was told Stables made a series of chilling Google searches including ""I want to go on a killing spree"", ""how to make chemical poison"" and ""what is prison like for a murderer"". This video can not be played White supremacist Ethan Stables burned rainbow flag He had also searched for how to make a bomb from matches, and police found a collection of cut-off match heads in his flat. At other times he expressed his hatred of Muslims and Jews, and said in a WhatsApp message: ""My country is being raped. ""I might just become a skinhead and kill people."" The right-wing extremist had a swastika hanging on his bedroom wall and bought a new Nazi armband after his was taken by police when he was arrested.

"Lauri Love is appealing his extradition to the US at the Royal Courts of Justice The extradition of an alleged computer hacker to the US would not be in the ""interests of justice"", High Court judges have been told. Lauri Love, 32, from Stradishall, Suffolk, is suspected of hacking into FBI, US Central Bank and Nasa systems. Edward Fitzgerald QC told the court there were ""overwhelming reasons of justice and humanity"" why any trial should take place in the UK. The case is before Lord Chief Justice Lord Burnett and Mr Justice Ouseley. Lauri Love wants to answer US charges against him in the UK In September 2016, District Judge Nina Tempia ruled at Westminster Magistrates' Court that Mr Love could be extradited. It is argued on Mr Love's behalf that she ""misdirected herself and erred in law in her conclusions"". Mr Fitzgerald said there was a ""compelling"" need for Mr Love, who has Asperger's syndrome, to stay in this country with the care and support of his family. He said there was a ""high risk"" of suicide if Mr Love is sent to the US. Lauri Love's supporters protested outside the Royal Courts of Justice Mr Fitzgerald submitted that the ""proper place for him to be tried, if he is to be tried, is in the UK and not in the US"". He told the court: ""The very fact that he would be taken away from his family, his home and the support that he desperately needs here is a disproportionate response to his alleged offending behaviour, because he could be tried here."" There was further evidence, he said, which had become available since the hearing before the district judge, as to the ""inhumanity of the conditions in the federal prison system"". Mr Love is alleged to have stolen huge amounts of data from US agencies, including the Federal Reserve, the US army, the defence department, Nasa and the FBI in a series of online attacks in 2012 and 2013. He could be jailed in the US for up to 99 years if he is found guilty. The court heard there was a ""high risk"" of suicide if Mr Love is sent to the US Peter Caldwell, representing the US, made submissions inviting the judges to dismiss Mr Love's appeal. In a written argument he said the district judge's conclusion on extradition was ""reasonably open to her on the findings of fact she made"". He said having identified a high risk of suicide, she ""properly assessed whether and how that risk could be managed were the appellant to be extradited"". Mr Caldwell told the judges: ""The evidence of the US authorities established that any risk to the appellant would be appropriately managed during transit in custody, and were bail refused, within the setting of pre-trial detention, and if he were convicted, on sentence."" The hearing is expected to conclude on Thursday morning.

The North Belfast MLA wasrecorded using bolt cutters to remove the clamp on Friday. Mr Kelly said he had agreed to pay a fine to the clamping company and also for the damage to the clamp. He said he had borrowed the bolt cutters he used from the gym he had been attending. He said as far as he was concerned the matter was now over. Stormontgate. Namagate. Clampgate? Mr Kelly said he had been at the gym early in the morning and discovered his car had been clamped as he was leaving. He said he tried to contact the clamping company, but had been unable to speak to anyone. The MLA said he had been due to attend political talks at Stormont and ""made a decision, almost on the spur of the moment"" to remove the clamp. He said he went back into the gym and borrowed bolt cutters they used to open lockers, telling staff he had a small problem with his car. This video can not be played Gerry Kelly 'regrets' removing clamp ""I did what I did, I regret doing it and I haven't done it before,"" Mr Kelly said. ""I shouldn't be above the law and neither should anybody else."" He said he had agreed to pay a fine of Â£150 to the clamping company, as well as Â£50 for damage to the clamp. Clamping in Northern Ireland The Department for Infrastructure (DfI) is responsible for the enforcement of most parking restrictions. Clamping and removal are used when parking tickets have not been paid. But the department has no responsibility when it comes to private land, such as a retail park, hospital or supermarket. Landowners can set their own rules and hire firms to police their parking restrictions. When it comes to clamping and towing on private land, Northern Ireland is out on its own. The Protection of Freedoms Actoutlawed the practice in England and Wales in 2012. It has been banned in Scotland since 1992. But in Gerry Kelly's case, there is another law at play - the Criminal Damage (Northern Ireland) Order 1977, which means you cannot damage other people's property ""without lawful excuse"". Clamping and criminal damage has been tested in the courts elsewhere. In 1991, a motorist in England was found guilty of causing criminal damage to property after he forcibly removed a clamp from his car in a private car park. His defence was that he had a lawful excuse for cutting the padlocks in that wheel-clamping was a trespass to his car, and under the principle of the ""recaption of goods"" he was entitled to recover his car. However, a year later, a Scottish appeal court called clamping ""extortion and theft"". ""The act of depriving the motorist of the use of his car by detaining it against his will can accurately be described as stealing something from him,"" one of the judges said. Mr Kelly said he had gone to the police to tell them what had happened, but that as far as he was concerned the matter was now over. As well as being an assembly member, the 64-year-old is also Sinn FÃ©in's policing spokesperson. He is also a former member of the Northern Ireland Policing Board, which holds the PSNI to account. Mr Kelly said he removed the clamp in an ""almost spur of the moment"" decision His actions were criticised by other political parties. DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds said it was a ""significant test for the Sinn FÃ©in leadership"". Mr Dodds asked: ""Will Gerry Adams, Mary Lou McDonald or Michelle O'Neill finally take action when we have their policing spokesperson act like this? ""Nobody's holding their breath."" The leader of the Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV), Jim Allister, also criticised Mr Kelly. ""He, who sat on the Policing Board, pontificating about law and order issues, should now think that he can take the law into his own hands and behave in this manner, needs to be called to account.

"Salah Abdeslam is refusing to co-operate with the court The sole surviving suspect from the 2015 Paris terror attacks refused to speak any further in a Belgian court, where his trial over the gunfight that led to his arrest began on Monday. Salah Abdeslam said he would not respond to questions from the judge. ""My silence does not make me a criminal, it's my defence,"" he said. Abdeslam, 28, claimed that Muslims were ""judged and treated in the worst of ways, mercilessly"", and said he was placing his trust in Allah. ""I am not afraid of you, I am not afraid of your allies,"" he added, without making clear who he meant. He urged the prosecution to base its case on ""forensic and tangible evidence"", and not to ""swagger about to satisfy public opinion"". The trial in Brussels was adjourned until Thursday. Abdeslam was arrested in March 2016 after a shootout with police in Brussels Abdeslam has refused to speak to investigators since his initial interrogation in March 2016. French prosecutors believe Abdeslam played a key role in the Paris attacks, in which gunmen and suicide bombers targeted a concert hall, stadium, restaurants and bars, killing 130 people and injuring hundreds more. He became Europe's most wanted man after the mass killings, and was captured in Brussels four months later. The defendant's brother, Brahim, was among the Paris attackers and died in a suicide blast outside a cafe. Five things to know about Salah Abdeslam Paris and Brussels bombers' links uncovered Abdeslam is not expected to go on trial in France until 2019 at the earliest. The charges he faces in Brussels are not related to events in Paris, but to a shootout with police while he was on the run in Belgium. This video can not be played Damian Grammaticas reports from the scene of the raid Abdeslam and his suspected accomplice Sofien Ayari, 24, are accused of possessing illegal weapons and the attempted murder of police officers in a terrorist context. The men allegedly fought a gun battle with officers who raided the flat where they were holed up, in the Molenbeek district of Brussels. The Belgian prosecutor, Kathleen Grosjean, said she was seeking the maximum of 20 years' imprisonment for each of them. Is Molenbeek a hotbed of extremism? In court on Monday, Ayari said he had fought for the jihadist group Islamic State (IS) in Syria, and that both he and Abdeslam were present during the standoff. The prosecutor has said she does not believe Abdeslam actually fired any weapons. She explained that two Kalashnikovs had been used during the clash. The first shooter is known to be Algerian national Mohamed Belkaid, who was subsequently shot by special police. The prosecution believes the second shooter is Ayari due to DNA found on the weapon. However, this would not affect Abdeslam's potential sentence, due to the ""indispensable aid"" he allegedly gave Ayari and Belkaid. A courtroom sketch of Abdeslam, who is refusing to have pictures or video taken of him Salah Abdeslam entered the court silently, all eyes trained on him. On either side of Abdeslam stood police guards wearing balaclavas. The photographs released by police during the four-month manhunt for him following the Paris attacks had shown a clean-shaven young man with short-cropped hair. Now his hair was longer, almost shoulder length. In prison he's also grown a beard. The old photos showed a slim, seemingly relaxed-looking man, the air of a swagger about him. Now he moved a little hesitantly. He said nothing. When the judge asked him to confirm his identity Abdeslam, wearing a white jacket, did not respond. She asked again. He had to be coaxed to acknowledge his own name. The judge explained to the court that Abdeslam did not want his picture to be shown, so any filming of him was prohibited. The man who prosecutors say was a willing part of a murderous gang that killed 130 people in Paris was unwilling now to show his face, or even to speak up in front of the court. He has also refused to talk to prosecutors, or even lawyers representing him. As his co-accused Sofien Ayari stood to answer questions about his time in Syria, and the automatic weapons they had kept in a flat in Brussels, Abdeslam sat in silence. For now he seems determined to divulge nothing about his role, or anything else connected to the attacks. Abdeslam is being transported between a French prison and a Belgian court for this trial Abdeslam, a French citizen born to Moroccan parents in Brussels, has been held at a prison near Paris. He left the facility under armed guard in the early hours of Monday, accompanied by tactical police vehicles. He will return to France every night during the trial, but will be held at another jail just across the border. Up to 200 police will be guarding the courthouse for the trial. The right to silence is protected by the European Convention on Human Rights, but it is not an absolute right. European human rights law says a defendant's decision to remain silent can be taken into account when assessing the prosecution's evidence.,externalThat is especially so ""in situations which clearly call for an explanation from him [the defendant]"". Observers say that given other suspects have spoken and co-operated with the police, Abdeslam's silence won't necessarily hurt the prosecution's case. But if he remains silent on the Paris attacks too, it would ""be horrible for the victims' families"", said Guy Van Vlierden, a Belgian journalist specialising in security and terrorism issues. Three explosions outside the Stade de France stadium in the north of Paris on 13 November 2015 as suicide attackers were prevented from entering. Minutes later, several people were killed asshootings and bombings took place around bars and restaurants, including the cafe-bar Le Carillon, in the centre of town. The worst attack of the night occurred at the Bataclan concert hall.Eighty-nine people were killed as attackers with suicide belts fired assault rifles into the crowd.

"Men who have sex with men are to be offered the (human papilloma virus) HPV vaccination in England. The programme for men aged 45 or younger will start from April 2018, to protect them from some cancers caused by HPV as well as genital warts, Since 2008, girls aged 11 to 13 have been offered vaccination against HPV, which can cause cervical cancer. Scotland,WalesandNorthern Ireland,externalalready offer the vaccine to men who have sex with other men. The English programme followed asuccessful pilotthat started in 42 specialist sexual health clinics in England in 2016. There will be a phased roll-out to men attending sexual health (GUM) clinics and HIV clinics in England. The pilot was prompted by increasing evidence of the association between HPV infection and non-cervical cancers in men who have sex with men. This high risk group does not benefit from indirect protection from the vaccination programme for girls. HPV increases the risk of oral, anal and penile cancers. Dr Michael Edelstein, consultant epidemiologist at Public Health England, said: ""Our evidence shows that men who have sex with men are welcoming an HPV vaccination programme, and it can be delivered successfully through sexual health services. ""They are a group who receive little indirect protection from the adolescent girls' vaccination programme. We expect the new programme to reduce the number of cancers that are directly caused by HPV."" Last year a decision not to vaccinate boys against HPVattracted fierce criticism. The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation found little evidence to justify treating boys. But critics said vaccinating boys could help reduce the risk of cancers still further.

"This video can not be played Kyle Enos used a number of identities to buy and supply fentanyl A man who used the dark web to export and sell the high-strength painkiller fentanyl has been jailed for eight years. Kyle Enos, 25, from Newport used a number of identities to buy and supply ""significant amounts"" of the opioid in the UK, USA and Canada. When officers raided his house they found 25,000 doses of the drug, said to be more potent than heroin. He admitted three charges relating to its supply at Cardiff Crown Court. Sentencing him on Monday, Judge Eleri Rees said that four of his customers had since died, ""evidence of how dangerous a drug it is"". Items seized during a raid on Enos's house on Maindee Parade in Newport According to America's Drug Enforcement Agency, fentanyl - which hit the headlines after it waslinked to the death of US singer Prince- is considered to be 50 times more potent than heroin. On Monday, Cardiff Crown Court heard Enos had contact with 166 customers in the UK, Europe and America, between May 2016 and May 2017. This video can not be played ""My child died from it"": One mum on the prescription painkiller being taken to get a high The National Crime Agency (NCA) said four of the people on the list had since died including 23 year old Jack Barton, a Cardiff University student found dead in his accommodation, and 34 year old Arran Rees who was found dead at his home in Ammanford, Carmarthenshire. But the court heard there was no certainty the fentanyl came from Enos, who used the name ""Soviet Bear"", and that no charges are being pursued in relation to these deaths. After his arrest, Enos admitted purchasing fentanyl from China and selling it on the dark web - part of the internet only accessible using special software, allowing users to largely remain untraceable. The NCA's Colin Williams said the agency was targeting people ""responsible for playing Russian roulette with the lives of drug users"" by mixing synthetic opioids with heroin. ""Kyle Enos is one of these individuals,"" he added. What is the dark web? Fentanyl: Painkiller killed my son, says mother John Davies, of the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), said he had created a business importing and selling potentially lethal doses of fentanyl on an ""international scale"". He said: ""The evidence presented by the CPS showed that Enos was well aware of the risks of taking fentanyl as he warned users when advertising the product.

"Many graduates receive ""paltry returns"" for their degrees despite racking up Â£50,000 in debt, says the chairman of the Education Select Committee. Robert Halfon will say in a speech on Monday, that between a fifth and a third of graduates take non-graduate jobs, and that any extra returns for having a degree ""vary wildly"". He will also suggest that too many people are studying academic degrees. University leaders maintain that a degree remains an excellent investment. In his speech on Monday, Mr Halfon, a former skills minister, will say the nation has ""become obsessed with full academic degrees"". ""We are creating a higher education system that overwhelmingly favours academic degrees, while intermediate and higher technical offerings are comparatively tiny. ""The labour market does not need an ever-growing supply of academic degrees. Between a fifth and a third of our graduates take non-graduate jobs. ""The 'graduate premium' varies wildly according to subject and institution. For many, the returns are paltry."" The degrees that make you rich... and the ones that don't At the Centre for Social Justice, he will say there is an ""enormous opportunity in rebalancing higher education"" and a strong need for intermediate skills. ""There are skills shortages in several sectors. And there are millions of people who want to get on in life - preferably without a lead weight of Â£50,000 dragging from their feet,"" he adds. He suggests: ""If we are going to continue to lavishly furnish universities with taxpayers' money, we need to think about how universities can specialise in these areas. ""Existing universities that do not provide a good return on academic courses could reinvent themselves as centres of technical excellence."" Eight things that were bigger killers in the 70s Uma Thurman breaks silence on Weinstein attack The mystery of the strangled billionaires His comments come as the latest University and College Admissions Service figures show a small drop in the number of people applying to higher education in the UK. Last year 559,030 people, including foreign students, applied to UK universities. This is the lowest number since 2014. A breakdown shows that there were 12,420 fewer UK applicants, a 2.6% drop compared to last year. It is the second annual drop in a row. This video can not be played Five things you should know about your student loan debt Most of this comes from a drop in 18 and 19-year-olds submitting applications, accounting for 70% of the fall in UK applicants, according to Ucas. Alistair Jarvis, chief executive of Universities UK, umbrella organisation for universities, said: ""This small drop in applicant figures can be attributed largely to the fall in the number of 18-year-olds across the UK population. ""This group makes up half of all UK applicants to universities. But the demand for courses from 18-year-olds across the UK remains strong, highlighting the continued demand for university education."" A spokesman for UUK said: ""Official figures are clear that, on average, university graduates continue to earn substantially more than non-graduates and are more likely to be in employment. A university degree remains an excellent investment. ""We must, however, be careful to avoid using graduate salaries as the single measure of success in higher education. Many universities specialise in fields such as the arts, the creative industries, nursing and public sector professions that, despite making an essential contribution to society and the economy, pay less on average."" But there has been growing concern about the amount of debt students are accumulating and the interest being charged on that debt. The government has promised a review of higher education funding in England in response. A spokesperson for the Department for Education said legislation had been introduced to reform higher education to ensure that students and the taxpayer got value for money. ""The government wants everyone to be equipped with the skills they need to get on in life and succeed in the jobs of the future,"" the spokesperson said.

"Sales of new diesel cars fell by 25% in January with the industry blaming ""confusion"" over government policy. Diesel sales were 25.6% lower than in January 2017, dragging overall sales down 6.3%, an industry body reported. The Society for Motor Manufacturers and Traders said confusion over government policy was causing buyers to hesitate. Diesels have been the focus of air quality concerns, prompting speculation that owners could face higher taxes or limits on where they can be used. The government has stated a long-term goal to ban the sale of new cars running solely on petrol or diesel by 2040. In November's budget,the government announcedcustomers buying new diesel cars will face a one-off tax increase in April, unless the vehicles meet a higher standard on emissions. Company car tax for diesels was also increased. London has already introduced a higher congestion charge for higher polluting vehicles, and other UK cities including Oxford have discussed limiting their access to city centres. The Society for Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said replacing older cars with new diesels would still reduce pollution and emissions as they are cleaner than older vehicles. The SMMT said demand for cars that run on petrol was 8.5% higher this January than a year earlier, but that positive move was offset by the steep decline in demand for diesels, which account for around a third of the market. Sales of ""alternatively fuelled vehicles"" including electric cars rose 23.9%, but they still account for only 5.5% of the market. SUVs were the only type of vehicle to see growth, with demand up 6.6%. SUVs accounted for a fifth of all new car registrations. ""The ongoing and substantial decline in new diesel car registrations is concerning, particularly since the evidence indicates consumers and businesses are not switching into alternative technologies, but keeping their older cars running,"" SMMT chief executive Mike Hawes said. ""Given fleet renewal is the fastest way to improve air quality and reduce CO2, we need government policy to encourage take up of the latest advanced low emission diesels as, for many drivers, they remain the right choice economically and environmentally,"" he added. UK car sales see first drop for six years What's gone wrong in the UK car market? How toxic is your car exhaust?,external New car sales overall fell by 5.7% in 2017. But annual sales were still higher than in every year during 2007-2014. Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club said that January, representing the 10th successive month of declining car sales, pointed to ""a serious loss of momentum in the sector"". Sales declined even more sharply in October, November and December. He said the government's environmental strategy was only part of the explanation. ""Even allowing for uncertainty over government policy on diesel cars affecting fleet sales, it appears that that businesses have become more reluctant to replace or add to their fleets amid a highly uncertain economic and political outlook.""

"This video can not be played Who are the Hatton Garden masterminds? One of the Â£14m Hatton Garden jewellery raiders, Terry Perkins, has died in prison aged 69. Perkins from Enfield, north London, was serving a jail term for the ""largest burglary in English legal history"". One of four ringleaders of the 2015 raid, he was last week ordered to pay back Â£6,526,571 or face a further seven-year jail term. Perkins and his fellow raiders stole goods after drilling into a vault at London's Hatton Garden Safe Deposit. He was serving his sentence in HMP Belmarsh and is believed to have been ill for some time. In a statement, the Prison Service said: ""As with all deaths in custody, there will be an independent investigation by the Prisons and Probation Ombudsman."" Who were the jewellery heist raiders? In pictures: How the Hatton Garden plot played out Ringleaders ordered to pay Â£27.5m Perkins was jailed for seven years, alongside two of the ringleaders, John ""Kenny"" Collins, 77, and Daniel Jones, 63,after pleading guilty to conspiracy to commit burglary in 2016. Fellow ringleader Brian Reader, 78, who was too ill to attend the initial sentencing, was later jailed for six years and three months. Terry Perkins was one of four ringleaders who carried out the raid in 2015 Last Tuesday, thegang members were ordered to pay back Â£27.5mbetween them or have their sentences increased. Judge Christopher Kinch QC said the men jointly benefitted from an estimated Â£13.69m worth of stolen cash, gold and gems. Peter Rowlands, Perkins' barrister, said his client - who had been diagnosed with ""severe heart failure"" - would have to serve the extra time as there was ""no prospect"" of any further funds being recovered. During last week's hearing, the judge said if any of the four could raise Â£6.4m to pay back, the others would each have that total taken off their confiscation order. If that were the case it would bring the total amount paid back by the burglars to about Â£8.2m. The vault at Hatton Garden Safe Deposit Ltd was breached over the 2015 Easter weekend Perkins was caught after Hatton Garden investigators installed a listening device in his blue Citroen Saxo, on which he was recorded  saying he planned to use his share of the spoils to fund his pension. He was arrested with Collins and Jones, having dropped off a holdall containing some of the loot. Perkins celebrated his birthday during the raid and was involved in all stages of the operation, including disposing of the stolen goods. He was inside the Hatton Garden building posing as a builder and ""working"" inside the lift on 31 March during the raid, which was carried out over the Easter weekend in 2015. When his home was searched police found jewellery, cash, blue workman's overalls and five pairs of white fabric gloves that were used by the burglars who aimed to leave no forensic evidence at the scene.

"This video can not be played Timberlake, Eagles & Osi - Super Bowl best moments The Philadelphia Eagles won the Super Bowl for the first time by beating the New England Patriots 41-33 in an extraordinary encounter in Minneapolis. On a night when records tumbled and the expected norms of an NFL game went out the window, the Eagles - led majestically by quarterback Nick Foles - produced a brilliant offensive display to deny the Patriots a record-equalling sixth Super Bowl crown. Zach Ertz's touchdown with less than three minutes remaining put the Eagles into a five-point lead, but it took Brandon Graham's sack on Tom Brady just moments later to seemingly put the game beyond the reigning champions. Even then the Eagles had to withstand a late march downfield by Brady, but victory was finally assured when a Hail Mary attempt came to nothing as the clock ticked down to zero. Relive how the Eagles beat the Patriots in thriller Timberlake touches down at Super Bowl Win sparks mayhem in Philadelphia In a game featuring just one punt and one sack - Graham's key hit on Brady - the action was breathless and, for the most part, unprecedented in NFL history. Chief among the highlights was the glorious moment when Foles - later named the game's Most Valuable Player - caught a pass from tight end Trey Burton on a gutsy trick play, making him the first player ever to throw and catch a touchdown in a Super Bowl. Foles also threw for three touchdowns from 373 passing yards, the 29-year-old Texan capping off his fairytale rise since being drafted in to replace the injured Carson Wentz three games from the end of the regular season. Opposite number Brady, meanwhile, is left to wonder just how he failed to add to his five Super Bowl rings despite 505 passing yards - a Super Bowl record - and three touchdown passes. The explosive nature of the two offenses saw the Eagles and Patriots combine for 1,151 yards in total, a record not just for a Super Bowl but for any regular- or post-season game in NFL history. This video can not be played Watch: The touchdown 'that will be shown a billion times' The Patriots became the first team in NFL history to put up more than 600 yards of offense in a game and lose. The Eagles set a new record for the highest number of points conceded by a winning team in the Super Bowl (33). Brady became the first quarterback in any NFL game to lose after throwing for more than 500 yards, three touchdowns and no interceptions. One sack in the game tied the Super Bowl record. Brady was appearing in his record eighth Super Bowl and was bidding to become the first man in the sport's history to win six times. LeGarrette Blount won the Super Bowl for the second year in succession but with different teams, having been part of the Patriots' victory over the Atalanta Falcons a year ago. The attendance of 67,612 inside Minneapolis' US Bank Stadium took the combined total attendance at the 52 Super Bowls held so far past the four-million mark. London-born Jay Ajayi ran for 57 yards for the Eagles as he became a Super Bowl champion just four months after he was traded by the Miami Dolphins. This video can not be played Watch the moment the Eagles won the Super Bowl Another takeaway statistic from this game was the fact there were more passes thrown to the two quarterbacks than there were either sacks or punts. Foles' successful end-zone catch late in the second quarter was a moment of tactical brilliance from Eagles head coach Doug Pederson in his first Super Bowl, but was he inspired by the same play by opposite number Bill Belichick? Earlier in the second quarter, the Pats ran their own trick play when Danny Amendola turned quarterback and tossed the ball to a wide-open Brady, who just could not haul it in. It was only the third time in their long association that 40-year-old Brady and Belichick had attempted such a move. Brady caught the other two. As it was, the ball was soon back in the Eagles' possession and in the end zone, former Patriot Blount running in for a touchdown. This video can not be played Jeffery scores spectacular touchdown for Eagles ""This is like they are playing basketball. What happened to the excellent defences? What happened to the Philadelphia pressure? I don't know what is going on!"" BBC pundit Osi Umenyiora, a two-time Super Bowl winner, pretty much summed up the emotion that came with watching a game in which offense was king. The Eagles had been widely viewed as underdogs before the game, with New England seeking a third title in four years. Add in the fact most of the Eagles' players were appearing in their first Super Bowl - their entire 53-man roster had seven appearances in the showpiece between them, a number matched by Brady alone - and the gulf in their respective pedigrees became all too clear. Yet when the game kicked off, there was nothing to choose between them. The two sides traded early field goals from Jake Elliott and Stephen Gostkowski before the Eagles scored the first touchdown when Foles found Alshon Jeffery for a spectacular catch. Blount powered over to make it 15-3 after Brady's agonising fumble, but the Patriots reduced the deficit with a James White touchdown before Foles delivered his party trick, turning receiver just before half-time. The scoring continued at breakneck pace in the second half with Rob Gronkowski adding two touchdowns for the Patriots and Chris Hogan another, but the Eagles were matching them punch for punch as Foles found Corey Clement with a clinical pass before Ertz's score and another Elliott field goal preceded a grandstand finish. MVP and Eagles quarterback Nick Foles:""I felt calm all night. We are such a great group of guys. We felt confident. We just went out there and played football. We've been dreaming of this since we were little kids."" Patriots quarterback Tom Brady:""I expect to be back. I don't see why I wouldn't be back. It's tough to lose these games. You play to win and sometimes you lose. Disappointed. Wish we could have done a better job."" Eagles coach Doug Pederson:""I have got the best players in the world, I love this group. We have the best fans in the world and now the best team in the world. We wanted to stay aggressive. My mentality was stay aggressive and let Nick Foles make plays."" Patriots coach Bill Belichick:""Obviously we didn't do a good enough job coaching. We missed a lot of opportunities offensively in the first half, didn't play good enough defense, didn't play good enough in the kicking game. ""In the end, we just couldn't quite make enough plays, and that was all on me. Disappointing, but I'm proud of the way our team competed."" Eagles lineman Brandon Graham, who forced the match-winning sack:""We worked our butt off and we are world champs baby!"" This video can not be played Justin Timberlake's Prince tribute at Super Bowl The half-time show is always central to the Super Bowl razzmatazz, and once again it delivered as Justin Timberlake paid tribute to Prince by performing I Would Die 4 U during a busy 12-minute set in the late superstar's home town. Timberlake ran into the crowd to dance and pose for photos in an unfailingly energetic appearance, writes BBC Music reporter Mark Savage. Timberlake also tacitly acknowledged his last Super Bowl performance in 2004, which ended with Janet Jackson's infamous 'wardrobe malfunction'. On that occasion, he ripped a panel off Jackson's bodice, revealing her right breast as he sang the lyric ""gonna have you naked by the end of this song"". When he reached that line on Sunday, Timberlake stopped the music and cut to another song. Read more of Mark's analysis here. Timberlake's show (broadcast on a five-second delay instigated after the 2004 Super Bowl) was largely controversy-free ""Minneapolis, Minnesota, this one's for you,"" Timberlake declared, singing a new arrangement of I Would Die 4 U over an archive recording of Prince's vocals, as images of the late superstar were projected behind him Timberlake ended his show in the stands, singing Can't Stop The Feeling with a teenage fan.

"This video can not be played Kyle Enos used a number of identities to buy and supply fentanyl A man who used the dark web to export and sell the high-strength painkiller fentanyl has been jailed for eight years. Kyle Enos, 25, from Newport used a number of identities to buy and supply ""significant amounts"" of the opioid in the UK, USA and Canada. When officers raided his house they found 25,000 doses of the drug, said to be more potent than heroin. He admitted three charges relating to its supply at Cardiff Crown Court. Sentencing him on Monday, Judge Eleri Rees said that four of his customers had since died, ""evidence of how dangerous a drug it is"". Items seized during a raid on Enos's house on Maindee Parade in Newport According to America's Drug Enforcement Agency, fentanyl - which hit the headlines after it waslinked to the death of US singer Prince- is considered to be 50 times more potent than heroin. On Monday, Cardiff Crown Court heard Enos had contact with 166 customers in the UK, Europe and America, between May 2016 and May 2017. This video can not be played ""My child died from it"": One mum on the prescription painkiller being taken to get a high The National Crime Agency (NCA) said four of the people on the list had since died including 23 year old Jack Barton, a Cardiff University student found dead in his accommodation, and 34 year old Arran Rees who was found dead at his home in Ammanford, Carmarthenshire. But the court heard there was no certainty the fentanyl came from Enos, who used the name ""Soviet Bear"", and that no charges are being pursued in relation to these deaths. After his arrest, Enos admitted purchasing fentanyl from China and selling it on the dark web - part of the internet only accessible using special software, allowing users to largely remain untraceable. The NCA's Colin Williams said the agency was targeting people ""responsible for playing Russian roulette with the lives of drug users"" by mixing synthetic opioids with heroin. ""Kyle Enos is one of these individuals,"" he added. What is the dark web? Fentanyl: Painkiller killed my son, says mother John Davies, of the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), said he had created a business importing and selling potentially lethal doses of fentanyl on an ""international scale"". He said: ""The evidence presented by the CPS showed that Enos was well aware of the risks of taking fentanyl as he warned users when advertising the product. ""Despite this knowledge he continued selling large quantities of the drug and even invited eBay-style reviews from his customers.""

"Hugh Grant and Crimewatch presenter Jacqui Hames, who also settled a phone-hacking claim against another newspaper, speaking after the hearing in London Actor Hugh Grant has settled a phone-hacking damages claim against Mirror Group Newspapers at the High Court. It is understood the star will be paid a six-figure sum, which he will donate to the campaign group Hacked Off. The actor said the newspaper group had been guilty of phone hacking on an ""industrial scale"" and called for another public inquiry to ""get to the truth"". MGN said it ""deeply regretted"" the acts and described them as ""morally wrong"". Grant, 57, appeared at the court in London to hear his lawyer give details of the hacking settlement. Anjlee Saigol told Mr Justice Mann the action against the Mirror Group related to the alleged illegal misuse of Grant's information obtained by hacking his voicemails, masquerading as other people, and surveillance. The action related to employees at all three of MGN newspapers - the Daily Mirror, Sunday Mirror and Sunday People. As part of Monday's settlement, MGN admitted that senior employees including its editors, executives and journalists ""condoned, encouraged or actively turned a blind eye"" to the culture of phone-hacking, lawyer Ms Saigol said. The offences took place between 1998 and 2009 under the editorships of Piers Morgan and Richard Wallace at the Daily Mirror and Tina Weaver at the Sunday Mirror. The three former editors, along with ex-chief executive of Trinity Mirror Sly Bailey, had previously given evidence to the Leveson Inquiry and denied knowledge of phone hacking at MGN. Their statements to the inquiry were later found to be ""wrong, not just disingenuous"" in a court ruling in 2015. Speaking outside court after Monday's hearing, Grant said: ""This case was not just about what they did to my phone and those close to me. ""In this litigation my lawyer and I pressed further because I was determined to uncover the truth about the nature of high-level concealment at the Mirror Group. Hugh Grant arriving at the Rolls Building in central London for the High Court hearing. ""This litigation has made clear that phone hacking and other unlawful information-gathering took place on an industrial scale at the Daily Mirror, Sunday Mirror and Sunday People.

""The public were not told the truth, the victims were not told the truth, the shareholders were not told the truth and the Leveson Inquiry was not told the truth."" ""That is why the second part of the Leveson Inquiry must take place - to get to the truth and discover who broke the law and who lied about it."" Grant's lawyer Anjlee Saigol added one of Grant's main reasons for pursuing the case was to establish the truth about the group's investigations and knowledge of its unlawful activities before it admitted them in September 2014. She also said the company ""actively sought to conceal its wrongdoing from its many victims of intrusion"" and admitted intrusions into people's lives could have been prevented. On Monday, the judge also heard details of settlements against MGN by actor Ralf Little and Rupert Lowe, who was the executive chairman and joint managing director of Southampton Football Club between 1999 and 2006. Former police officer and Crimewatch presenter Jacqui Hames also settled her action against News Group Newspapers, publishers of the News of the World. Speaking for MGN, Alex Wilson said: ""MGN accepts that the unlawful interception of voicemail messages and procurement of private information about Mr Grant and others should never have happened. ""MGN acknowledges that was morally wrong and deeply regrets the wrongful acts of its former employees which caused damage and distress to those affected, including Mr Grant."" The newspaper has been taken to court multiple times over claims of phone-hacking. In October last year, comedianSteve Coogan was the latest in a long list of more than 40 celebrities to have settled phone-hacking claimsagainst MGN. They include Lord Archer, footballer Kevin Keegan and actresses Patsy Kensit and Michelle Collins. Grant, who is known for films including Notting Hill and Four Weddings and a Funeral, has been one of the leading voices in the campaign for stricter press regulation. In 2012 heaccepted a ""substantial sum"" in damages from the now-defunct News of the World. Grant was one of the victims of the paper's widespread phone hacking, which led to its closure in 2011. He gave evidence at the Leveson Inquiry into press ethics, set up following the News of the World phone-hacking scandal. Grant accepts sum over phone hacking.

The offences took place between 1998 and 2009 under the editorships of Piers Morgan and Richard Wallace at the Daily Mirror and Tina Weaver at the Sunday Mirror. The three former editors, along with ex-chief executive of Trinity Mirror Sly Bailey, had previously given evidence to the Leveson Inquiry and denied knowledge of phone hacking at MGN. Their statements to the inquiry were later found to be ""wrong, not just disingenuous"" in a court ruling in 2015. Speaking outside court after Monday's hearing, Grant said: ""This case was not just about what they did to my phone and those close to me. ""In this litigation my lawyer and I pressed further because I was determined to uncover the truth about the nature of high-level concealment at the Mirror Group. Hugh Grant arriving at the Rolls Building in central London for the High Court hearing. ""This litigation has made clear that phone hacking and other unlawful information-gathering took place on an industrial scale at the Daily Mirror, Sunday Mirror and Sunday People. ""This newspaper group has misled the public and its shareholders for many years; and it has let down its readers and its hard-working journalists. Allow Twitter content?

""The public were not told the truth, the victims were not told the truth, the shareholders were not told the truth and the Leveson Inquiry was not told the truth."" ""That is why the second part of the Leveson Inquiry must take place - to get to the truth and discover who broke the law and who lied about it."" Grant's lawyer Anjlee Saigol added one of Grant's main reasons for pursuing the case was to establish the truth about the group's investigations and knowledge of its unlawful activities before it admitted them in September 2014. She also said the company ""actively sought to conceal its wrongdoing from its many victims of intrusion"" and admitted intrusions into people's lives could have been prevented. On Monday, the judge also heard details of settlements against MGN by actor Ralf Little and Rupert Lowe, who was the executive chairman and joint managing director of Southampton Football Club between 1999 and 2006. Former police officer and Crimewatch presenter Jacqui Hames also settled her action against News Group Newspapers, publishers of the News of the World. Speaking for MGN, Alex Wilson said: ""MGN accepts that the unlawful interception of voicemail messages and procurement of private information about Mr Grant and others should never have happened. ""MGN acknowledges that was morally wrong and deeply regrets the wrongful acts of its former employees which caused damage and distress to those affected, including Mr Grant."" The newspaper has been taken to court multiple times over claims of phone-hacking. In October last year, comedianSteve Coogan was the latest in a long list of more than 40 celebrities to have settled phone-hacking claimsagainst MGN. They include Lord Archer, footballer Kevin Keegan and actresses Patsy Kensit and Michelle Collins. Grant, who is known for films including Notting Hill and Four Weddings and a Funeral, has been one of the leading voices in the campaign for stricter press regulation. In 2012 heaccepted a ""substantial sum"" in damages from the now-defunct News of the World. Grant was one of the victims of the paper's widespread phone hacking, which led to its closure in 2011. He gave evidence at the Leveson Inquiry into press ethics, set up following the News of the World phone-hacking scandal. Grant accepts sum over phone hacking.

"This video can not be played Who are the Hatton Garden masterminds? One of the Â£14m Hatton Garden jewellery raiders, Terry Perkins, has died in prison aged 69. Perkins from Enfield, north London, was serving a jail term for the ""largest burglary in English legal history"". One of four ringleaders of the 2015 raid, he was last week ordered to pay back Â£6,526,571 or face a further seven-year jail term. Perkins and his fellow raiders stole goods after drilling into a vault at London's Hatton Garden Safe Deposit. He was serving his sentence in HMP Belmarsh and is believed to have been ill for some time. In a statement, the Prison Service said: ""As with all deaths in custody, there will be an independent investigation by the Prisons and Probation Ombudsman."" Who were the jewellery heist raiders? In pictures: How the Hatton Garden plot played out Ringleaders ordered to pay Â£27.5m Perkins was jailed for seven years, alongside two of the ringleaders, John ""Kenny"" Collins, 77, and Daniel Jones, 63,after pleading guilty to conspiracy to commit burglary in 2016. Fellow ringleader Brian Reader, 78, who was too ill to attend the initial sentencing, was later jailed for six years and three months. Terry Perkins was one of four ringleaders who carried out the raid in 2015 Last Tuesday, thegang members were ordered to pay back Â£27.5mbetween them or have their sentences increased. Judge Christopher Kinch QC said the men jointly benefitted from an estimated Â£13.69m worth of stolen cash, gold and gems. Peter Rowlands, Perkins' barrister, said his client - who had been diagnosed with ""severe heart failure"" - would have to serve the extra time as there was ""no prospect"" of any further funds being recovered. During last week's hearing, the judge said if any of the four could raise Â£6.4m to pay back, the others would each have that total taken off their confiscation order. If that were the case it would bring the total amount paid back by the burglars to about Â£8.2m. The vault at Hatton Garden Safe Deposit Ltd was breached over the 2015 Easter weekend Perkins was caught after Hatton Garden investigators installed a listening device in his blue Citroen Saxo, on which he was recorded  saying he planned to use his share of the spoils to fund his pension. He was arrested with Collins and Jones, having dropped off a holdall containing some of the loot. Perkins celebrated his birthday during the raid and was involved in all stages of the operation, including disposing of the stolen goods. He was inside the Hatton Garden building posing as a builder and ""working"" inside the lift on 31 March during the raid, which was carried out over the Easter weekend in 2015. When his home was searched police found jewellery, cash, blue workman's overalls and five pairs of white fabric gloves that were used by the burglars who aimed to leave no forensic evidence at the scene.

"This video can not be played Barnier: It's time for UK to make a choice The UK will face ""unavoidable"" barriers to trade if it leaves the customs union and single market, the EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier has said. Speaking in Downing Street, he said the ""time had come"" for the UK to choose what it wanted after its 2019 exit. Brexit Secretary David Davis said the UK's position was ""perfectly clear"". The UK, he argued, wanted a free trade deal with the EU but also the freedom to strike deals with other countries, where trade opportunities were growing. ""There's no doubt about it. We are leaving the customs union but we are aiming for a good future for Britain,"" Mr Davis said. He also said he was confident the two sides would reach an agreement on a ""transitional"" or ""implementation"" phase - to last between 18 months and two years after the UK leaves next year - in time for an EU summit at the end of March. After lunch with Mr Davis and a 20-minute meeting with Theresa May, Mr Barnier said there was ""some divergence"" between the two sides when it came to issues relating to transition and how the exit deal would be enforced. Kuenssberg: The clock is ticking Explained: Customs union and single market Reality Check: How soon are Brexit answers needed? What is the Brexit 'transition phase' all about? While he said he respected the UK's decision to rule out any form of long-term customs union and other so-called ""red lines"", he said it was a prerequisite of any deal that ""everyone plays by the same rules"" during the transition period - where the UK would have to comply with existing EU laws and regulations. He said he wanted greater clarity from the UK about what ultimate partnership it wanted with the EU after its departure, expressing his hope an ""official position"" would be put forward soon.

""The only thing I can say, without a customs union and outside the single market, barriers to trade in goods and services are unavoidable. The time has come to make a choice."" The government's 11-strong Brexit cabinet sub-committee will meet on Wednesday and Thursday as UK officials prepare to brief their EU counterparts on their vision for post-Brexit relations on Friday. At the same time, there will be initial discussions on the ""transitional"" period as well as efforts to convert the details of December's agreement on the Irish border, citizens' rights and money into a legal framework. Ahead of this, Downing Street ruled out any form of customs union with the EU, which would give the UK access to tariff-free trade within the bloc but mean it cannot negotiate its own deals with other countries.

Downing Street said the government had set out two potential alternatives last summer - a new customs partnership without the need for any customs checks and a ""highly streamlined"" arrangement in which EU arrivals would be subject to customs checks but in a way that minimised disruption through technology. No 10 would not say which was the preferred option and said work was continuing on both proposals. Conservative MEP Daniel Hannan said Switzerland was an example of a country which had both its own customs arrangements with the EU and an independent trade policy. Michel Barnier was welcomed to No 10 by David Davis ""Britain is a global country, a world trader,"" he told the BBC's Daily Politics, adding that the UK had been ""artificially penalised"" by the customs unions because it trades more outside the EU than inside. But former attorney general Dominic Grieve said he found Downing Street's intervention ""rather strange"" since the UK would have to maintain some form of ""customs union or alignment"" with the EU if it was to honour the terms of its agreement to prevent any hard border on the island of Ireland. Ministers are looking at two options to ensure ""frictionless"" trade after Brexit Labour said it was ""foolhardy"" to rule out any kind of customs union with the UK's largest trading partner. ""The government must put jobs and the economy first, not their own internal party wrangling,"" a party spokesman said. In the House of Commons, ministers faced criticism for delays in putting forward new post-Brexit immigration rules. The government has said new border controls will be brought in when EU free movement rules no longer apply, but a promised White Paper policy document has yet to be published. Businesses groups have expressed frustration at the wait for concrete proposals. And in an urgent Commons question, Labour MP Yvette Cooper, who chairs the Home Affairs Select Committee, said it was a ""shambles"" and accused the government of ""kicking the can down the road"". Immigration Minister Caroline Nokes denied this, saying it was ""imperative"" that the White Paper and an immigration bill were the ""right pieces of legislation"" when they were brought to the Commons. ""We will publish a White Paper in the coming months, when the time is right,"" she said. Rudd hits back at Brexiteers What happens now that a deal's been done?

"A key pay factor was women working part-time in motherhood, the report suggests Mothers in part-time jobs are being hit by a ""pay penalty"" and are often not given pay rises linked to experience, a new study has suggested. The Institute for Fiscal Studies report found by the time a couple's first child is aged 20, many mothers earn nearly a third less than the fathers. A key factor was women working part-time in motherhood, the report said. A gender pay gap between graduates has not improved since 1993, despite gaps narrowing for non-graduates, it added. What is the gender pay gap? Gender pay gap and equal pay: What's the difference? Gender pay gap 'widens as women get older' Should men take a pay cut to reduce gender pay gap? The study, compiled on behalf of the independent Joseph Rowntree Foundation charity, found when women become mothers and start to work part-time they may miss out on the benefits of full-time employment - where experience is rewarded with progression and higher pay. Yasmin Latif from Bow, in London, was a deputy head teacher at an inner city sixth form college. She earned Â£49,000-a-year, but decided to seek part-time work so she could care for her elderly mother. The 49-year-old said: ""You almost lose your status if you go down to part-time work, you're not allowed to be a head of year or a head of department if you're working part-time."" Now she works as a lecturer three days a week for Â£22,000-a-year. ""I earn what I did as a graduate 30 years ago,"" she said. She added that she has had use her life savings in order to pay the bills. ""The effect of part-time work in shutting down wage progression is especially striking,"" the report added. ""Whereas, in general, people in paid work see their pay rise year on year as they gain more experience, our new research shows that part-time workers miss out on these gains."" The vast majority of part-time workers were women, especially mothers of young children, the report said. It said the lack of earnings growth in part-time work particularly affects graduate women, ""because they are the women for whom continuing in full-time paid work would have led to the most wage progression"". One example in the report is that of a graduate who has worked full-time for seven years before having a child. If she continued in full-time work for another year she would on average see her hourly wage rise by 6%. She would see ""none of that wage progression"" if she switched to part-time work instead, say the report authors. This video can not be played Do you know the difference between the gender pay gap and equal pay? Monica Costa Dias, associate director at the IFS and a co-author of the report, said: ""It is remarkable that periods spent in part-time work lead to virtually no wage progression at all."" The report also notes the narrowing of the non-graduate gender pay gap between women and men educated to GCSE-level with the difference in average hourly pay falling from 28% in the early 1990s to about 18% in 2016. The report said this change from 1993 is because ""women in work are now better educated relative to men than they were"". The research shows women with A-levels have seen the wage gap close from 29% in 1993 to around 22%. By comparison, it found the average hourly wages of men and women with degrees differed by 22% in 2016 - compared with 21% in 1993. Robert Joyce, associate director at the IFS and co-author of the report, said: ""Traditionally it has been lower-educated women whose wages were especially low relative to similarly educated men. ""It is now the highest-educated women whose wages are the furthest behind their male counterparts - and this is particularly related to the fact that they lose out so badly from working part-time."" The report said a key challenge for future research was to understand why part-time work shuts down wage progression so much. ""There are a number of possibilities, including less training provision, missing out on informal interactions and networking opportunities, and genuine constraints placed upon the build-up of skill by working fewer hours,"" it said. However, even before women have their first child, the IFS said they were on average being paid 10% less than men. Mr Joyce saidnew legislationthat requires UK companies with more than 250 employees to publish their gender pay gaps ""could be part of the solution"" since women may not be aware that men were being paid more than them. Lynsey Reynolds, Cardiff I went part-time in 2012 after having twins, due to the affordability of childcare. At the time I had a good career in NHS finance. However I was subsequently told by my manager in the NHS that while I was part-time I would never get anywhere working for him. I ended up leaving the NHS to work for a smaller organisation who needed a part-time finance manager. It still rankles that I was forced to choose between motherhood and my career in the NHS. Sharron Wilson, Warwickshire Sharron worked in project management for six years but then decided to pursue a Masters and a PhD. After having two children and completing her studies, she returned to part-time work in administration. The biggest problem is a shortage of well-paid part-time jobs. They are few and far between and when they come out, competition is fierce. I get paid an okay amount, but never see anything part-time the next grade up. So I may have to wait another few years, when the children are older, before going back full-time, and then all the job opportunities will be open to me. Cat McGrann, Kingston-upon-Thames Cat works part-time so she can care for her two young children. She said that her salary has not increased by much. I have a good job with decent pay, but am working a 70% job for Â£500-a-month after nursery fees. If I worked full-time and we needed full-time childcare, it would be Â£300 [after childcare fees]. What was a choice is now a trap. For most families [part-time work] is a financial necessity and women take the hit with diminished careers, missed promotions, lost earnings and lower pensions.

"Whale shark in Isla Mujeres Mexico Scientists say there needs to be more research into the impact of plastic pollution on sharks, whales and rays. A study, in the journalTrends in Ecology and Evolution, says the creatures may be swallowing hundreds of tiny bits of plastic a day. Microplastic pollution has the potential to further reduce the population sizes of the large filter feeders, they say. Yet, there is very little research being carried out into the risks. Researchers from the US, Australia and Italy looked at data on threats to large filter feeders from microplastics. These small plastic pieces less than five millimetres long can be harmful to the ocean and aquatic life. The Gulf of Mexico, the Mediterranean Sea, the Bay of Bengal and the Coral Triangle are priorities for monitoring, according to a review of studies. Manta ray with plastic in Indonesia ""The full magnitude of risks of ingesting microplastics are yet to be fully investigated,"" said Elitza Germanov of Murdoch University, Australia, and researcher at the US Marine Megafauna Foundation. Possible risks include reduced nutritional uptake and damage to the digestive system when microplastics are ingested, she said. In addition, toxin exposure through plastic ingestion could affect many biological processes, such as growth and reproduction, putting filter feeding populations ""under even more strain"", she added. The study argues that large filter feeders, many of which are ""charismatic and economically important species"", should be prioritised for further research into risks from microplastics. Filter feeders swallow hundreds of cubic metres of water a day to capture their food from water, and may take in microplastics during the process. Microplastics are similar in size and mass to many types of plankton. Manta ray, a giant of the ocean, swimming amongst plastic Studies have shown chemicals associated with plastics in the bodies of whale sharks and fin whales. ""Our studies on whale sharks in the Sea of Cortez and on fin whales in the Mediterranean Sea confirmed exposure to toxic chemicals, indicating that these filter feeders are taking up microplastics in their feeding grounds,"" said co-researcher Prof Maria Fossi of the University of Siena in Italy. ""Exposure to these plastic-associated toxins pose a major threat to the health of these animals since it can alter the hormones, which regulate the body's growth and development, metabolism, and reproductive functions, among other things."" Seven charts that explain the plastic pollution problem Whale sharks feeding in the Sea of Cortez off Mexico's Baja Peninsula, which is an important breeding ground, are estimated to ingest under 200 pieces of plastic per day. Fin whales in the Mediterranean Sea are thought to be swallowing closer to 2,000 microplastic particles per day. Microplastics under the microscope The researchers say there have been reports of 800kg of plastic found in the carcass of a stranded whale in France and another in Australia contained six square metres of plastic sheeting as well as 30 whole plastic carrier bags. The report highlights several key coastal regions for research and monitoring within the habitat ranges of the animals, including the Coral Triangle, the Gulf of Mexico, the Mediterranean Sea, the Bay of Bengal and other areas that have high microplastic concentration levels, such as the world's five oceanic gyres. Whale sharks and other flagship species may act as a focal point for research, especially in countries that rely on wildlife tourism, say the researchers. This video can not be played A giant build-up of plastic was captured by underwater photographer Caroline Power ""It is worth highlighting that utilising these iconic species, such as whale sharks, manta rays and whales to gain the attention of and engage with communities, policy makers and managers will go far to enhance stewardship of entire marine ecosystems,"" said Ms Germanov, who is a PhD student at Murdoch University. A number of filter-feeding sharks, rays and whales are on the edge of extinction. Many are long-lived and give birth to few offspring during their lives. The whale shark, for example, is listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List.

"David Davis and Theresa May will meet Michel Barnier this week Downing Street has insisted Britain will leave the EU customs union after Brexit amid claims of Tory disunity over the UK-EU future relationship. Theresa May has faced calls to spell out what she wants from the talks ahead of the UK's departure in March 2019. In a customs union the UK would have tariff-free trade within the EU, but would lose the ability to strike its own deals with other countries. It comes ahead of a meeting with the EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier. Explained: Customs union and single market Laura Kuenssberg: Customs union - the, a, or c? Amber Rudd hits back at Brexiteers What is the Brexit 'transition phase' all about? The prime minister and Brexit Secretary David Davis will meet Mr Barnier ahead of the next round of negotiations getting under way. Later, talks between officials will focus for the first time on the transitional period planned for after Brexit. Potential sticking points include citizens' rights, with the UK insisting EU nationals arriving during this time should not have the same rights as those who arrived before Brexit day. Mr Barnier, who is on his way to London, said he wanted to ""accelerate"" his schedule of meetings As he set off for London, Mr Barnier said there was ""not a moment to lose"" in order to secure a deal before the end of the year. Asked about the UK's position on the customs union, he said Downing Street's ""red lines"" would be respected but the UK must respect the ""rules of the union"". How close the UK will remain to the EU's single market and customs union has been a topic of debate among leading Brexiteers and some of those closest to the prime minister. Conservative MP Kwasi Kwarteng, who is an aide to Chancellor Philip Hammond, suggested the latest statement on the customs union was ""perfectly consistent"" with what No 10 had been saying all along, given that Mrs May had been ""pretty clear"" in her January 2017 Lancaster House speech the UK would be leaving. This video can not be played MP Kwasi Kwarteng tells Today a border in Northern Ireland doesn't have to be ""hard"" Pressed on how he squared this reality with Mr Hammond's stated desire for the UK and EU to move ""very modestly"" apart in terms of trade, he told BBC Radio 4's Today that ""being modestly apart does not mean you have to be in a customs union"". He said the government had to make it clearer its core aim was a free trade deal with the EU. On Sunday Eurosceptic Tory Bernard Jenkin accused the government of being ""vague"" and ""divided"", saying Chancellor Philip Hammond was not sticking to the approach put forward by the prime minister. Home Secretary Amber Rudd - who was a leading figure in the Remain campaign - played down the divisions in the cabinet, telling the BBC's Andrew Marr Show on Sunday: ""I have a surprise for the Brexiteers, which is the committee that meets in order to help make these decisions is more united than they think."" Future options? In a position paper published in August, the UK set out two potential options for future long-term customs operations. A ""partnership"" arrangement would see the UK ""align precisely"" with the EU in terms of imports and exports, removing the need for any customs checks between the two. The UK would continue to operate its own checks on goods coming from outside the EU - and safeguards would be needed to prevent goods entering the EU that had not complied with its rules. An alternative scenario would involve the UK extending customs checks to EU arrivals but under a ""highly streamlined arrangement"" to minimise disruption at ports and airports. This would seek to make the existing system of customs checks ""even more efficient"", for example using number plate recognition technology at ports, which could be linked to customs declarations for what the vehicles are carrying, meaning the vehicles do not have to be manually stopped and checked. UK proposes 'untested' customs system Ms Rudd said they agreed on the need for ""frictionless trade"", the ability to strike international trade deals and to avoid a hard border in Ireland, hitting back at those who question whether such a deal can be secured. ""We want to have a bespoke agreement,"" she said. ""Now we're not going to surrender before we have that battle."" She said Mrs May - who will chair a meeting of the 10-strong Brexit cabinet sub-committee on Wednesday and Thursday - had an ""open mind"" on how customs will be managed after Brexit. This video can not be played Amber Rudd says Jacob Rees-Mogg should not have accused Treasury of fiddling figures Quizzed on what the model might look like, she said she was ""not intimidated at all"" by critics' warnings about customs unions membership. Labour said it was ""foolhardy"" to rule out any kind of customs union with the UK's largest trading partner.

"Hugh Grant and Crimewatch presenter Jacqui Hames, who also settled a phone-hacking claim against another newspaper, speaking after the hearing in London Actor Hugh Grant has settled a phone-hacking damages claim against Mirror Group Newspapers at the High Court. It is understood the star will be paid a six-figure sum, which he will donate to the campaign group Hacked Off. The actor said the newspaper group had been guilty of phone hacking on an ""industrial scale"" and called for another public inquiry to ""get to the truth"". MGN said it ""deeply regretted"" the acts and described them as ""morally wrong"". Grant, 57, appeared at the court in London to hear his lawyer give details of the hacking settlement. Anjlee Saigol told Mr Justice Mann the action against the Mirror Group related to the alleged illegal misuse of Grant's information obtained by hacking his voicemails, masquerading as other people, and surveillance. The action related to employees at all three of MGN newspapers - the Daily Mirror, Sunday Mirror and Sunday People. As part of Monday's settlement, MGN admitted that senior employees including its editors, executives and journalists ""condoned, encouraged or actively turned a blind eye"" to the culture of phone-hacking, lawyer Ms Saigol said. The offences took place between 1998 and 2009 under the editorships of Piers Morgan and Richard Wallace at the Daily Mirror and Tina Weaver at the Sunday Mirror. The three former editors, along with ex-chief executive of Trinity Mirror Sly Bailey, had previously given evidence to the Leveson Inquiry and denied knowledge of phone hacking at MGN. Their statements to the inquiry were later found to be ""wrong, not just disingenuous"" in a court ruling in 2015. Speaking outside court after Monday's hearing, Grant said: ""This case was not just about what they did to my phone and those close to me. ""In this litigation my lawyer and I pressed further because I was determined to uncover the truth about the nature of high-level concealment at the Mirror Group. Hugh Grant arriving at the Rolls Building in central London for the High Court hearing. ""This litigation has made clear that phone hacking and other unlawful information-gathering took place on an industrial scale at the Daily Mirror, Sunday Mirror and Sunday People. ""This newspaper group has misled the public and its shareholders for many years; and it has let down its readers and its hard-working journalists. Allow Twitter content?

""The public were not told the truth, the victims were not told the truth, the shareholders were not told the truth and the Leveson Inquiry was not told the truth."" ""That is why the second part of the Leveson Inquiry must take place - to get to the truth and discover who broke the law and who lied about it."" Grant's lawyer Anjlee Saigol added one of Grant's main reasons for pursuing the case was to establish the truth about the group's investigations and knowledge of its unlawful activities before it admitted them in September 2014. She also said the company ""actively sought to conceal its wrongdoing from its many victims of intrusion"" and admitted intrusions into people's lives could have been prevented. On Monday, the judge also heard details of settlements against MGN by actor Ralf Little and Rupert Lowe, who was the executive chairman and joint managing director of Southampton Football Club between 1999 and 2006. Former police officer and Crimewatch presenter Jacqui Hames also settled her action against News Group Newspapers, publishers of the News of the World. Speaking for MGN, Alex Wilson said: ""MGN accepts that the unlawful interception of voicemail messages and procurement of private information about Mr Grant and others should never have happened. ""MGN acknowledges that was morally wrong and deeply regrets the wrongful acts of its former employees which caused damage and distress to those affected, including Mr Grant."" The newspaper has been taken to court multiple times over claims of phone-hacking. In October last year, comedianSteve Coogan was the latest in a long list of more than 40 celebrities to have settled phone-hacking claimsagainst MGN. They include Lord Archer, footballer Kevin Keegan and actresses Patsy Kensit and Michelle Collins. Grant, who is known for films including Notting Hill and Four Weddings and a Funeral, has been one of the leading voices in the campaign for stricter press regulation. In 2012 heaccepted a ""substantial sum"" in damages from the now-defunct News of the World. Grant was one of the victims of the paper's widespread phone hacking, which led to its closure in 2011. He gave evidence at the Leveson Inquiry into press ethics, set up following the News of the World phone-hacking scandal. Grant accepts sum over phone hacking.

"Sex and the City actress Kim Cattrall has announced the death of her brother, after earlier issuing a public appeal for information on his whereabouts. Christopher Cattrall, 55, had been missing from his home in Alberta, Canada, since Tuesday. Kim Cattrall had appealed to her social media followers for help finding him. His keys, cell phone, and wallet were left on the table, the front door was unlocked, and his seven ""beloved"" dogs were left unattended, she said. ""This is not like Chris... Help us bring him home safe,"" she had asked fans. Later on Sunday, the Liverpool-born actor posted a message on Twitter saying: ""It is with great sadness that myself and my family announce the unexpected passing of our son and brother, Chris Cattrall."" The message thanks those who offered support and asks for privacy. No further details were given. A spokesperson for the Royal Canadian Mounted Police said there was no reason to believe there was anything suspicious in the death. Allow Twitter content?

"Two leading cabinet ministers have said that the UK will not remain in the single market or customs union during the transitional period planned for immediately after leaving the European Union. The UK government is now set to spell out its aims for new customs arrangements. But what is the difference between a free trade area, single market and a customs union? You can be in the EU's Single Market, but not the EU, this is what Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein do. The European Union's single market is perhaps the most ambitious type of trade co-operation. That's because as well as eliminating tariffs, quotas or taxes on trade, it also includes the free movement of goods, services, capital and people. That is why there has been no limit on the number of French people who can come to the UK, or the number of British people who can live in Spain - but there are limits on Turks or Ukrainians, for example. Also, a single market strives to remove so-called ""non-tariff barriers"" - different rules on packaging, safety and standards and many others are abolished and the same rules and regulations apply across the area. There are EU-wide regulations covering a whole host of industries and products on everything from food standards and the use of chemicals to working hours and health and safety. It is an attempt to create a level playing field and a single market; this does not happen in a free trade zone. A customs union means the Ireland/Northern Ireland border would remain open and easy to cross For goods, the single market was largely completed in 1992, but the market for services remains a work in progress a quarter of a century later. The EU has promised to introduce it many times, but several countries have dragged their feet and it is much more complicated than creating a single market for say, cars or computers. Even so, the City of London dominates financial services in the EU not least because it can do business in every member country. The EU is therefore not just a free trade area - it is a single market. But to stay in the single market, countries have to allow the free movement of goods, services, capital and people. That last one means immigration is difficult if not impossible to control - although the UK might get a special deal to allow some limits. Membership of the single market also normally involves making annual payments towards the EU's budget and accepting the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice, which would cross quite a few red lines for many Brexiteers. Turkey is part of a customs union with the EU but not in the single market. The deal does not cover food or agriculture, services or government procurement. The EU is not only a single market - it is also a customs union. The countries club together and agree to apply the same tariffs to goods from outside the union. Once goods have cleared customs in one country, they can be shipped to others in the union without further tariffs being imposed. If the UK left the Customs Union but stayed in the Single market, our exporters would  have to contend with what are called 'rules of origin'. These rules are designed to demonstrate that goods that legally originated in the UK - and did not contain more than the maximum permitted level of parts and components from elsewhere - qualify for duty-free entry into the EU. Fish factor That could be complicated for many companies that import components from around the world to put into finished products made in the UK. Some industries, such as fisheries, could be exempted from a free trade area depending on negotiations Also services are a huge part of the British economy, 78%, and are not totally covered by a customs union because they tend to face ""non tariff"" barriers. Still the UK could opt to leave the single market but stay in the customs union, but that does mean it couldn't negotiate free trade deals with other countries, the EU does that. It might also mean paying money to the EU and accepting ECJ judgements when they relate to trade and it is unlikely to cover farm produce or fish since the UK would not be in the Common Agricultural Policy or Common Fisheries Policy. A customs union does however have one big advantage, it means the Ireland/Northern Ireland border would remain open and easy to cross. If we left both the single market and the customs union we could negotiate a free  trade deal with the EU. A free trade area is one where there are no tariffs or taxes or quotas on goods and/or services from one country entering another. The negotiations to establish them can take years and there are normally exceptions. So agriculture and fisheries might be exempted, certain industries protected and some goods may not be covered. Services like banking and education also pose a problem in many free trade deals, as the barrier to trading services are not normally tariffs, but so called non-tariff barriers like different rules, standards and qualifications. So the negotiations can be very long and complicated and the result can still leave many barriers to trade. The UK is Ireland's biggest trading partner There is a free trade zone in Europe and we helped to create it: EFTA, the European Free Trade Association. It counts Norway, Iceland, Switzerland and Liechtenstein as members, but they now have a very close relationship with the EU; all but Switzerland are part of the single market. The EU also has free trade arrangements with many other countries around the world; so it is not against negotiating one with the UK in principle, but compared with staying in the single market or the customs union this would be the ""hardest"" form of Brexit. It would also almost certainly mean border controls including between Ireland and Northern Ireland.

"This video can not be played Amber Rudd says Jacob Rees-Mogg should not have accused Treasury of fiddling figures Home Secretary Amber Rudd has hit back at Tory Brexiteers over attacks on the civil service and claims of disunity. Ms Rudd said backbencher Jacob Rees-Mogg was ""wrong"" to accuse the Treasury of ""fiddling the figures"" with forecasts showing the UK would be worse off outside the EU. The leaked forecast that sparked the row was a cross-departmental ""tool"" to ""help inform the debate"", she said. And she said ministers were more united over Brexit than critics claim. Speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr show, she said she was ""not intimidated"" by Brexiteers' warnings over the customs union and that the UK government would not ""surrender too quickly"" in its battle for a ""bespoke"" trade deal with the EU. All you need to know about Brexit What the EU really wants from the UK The key Brexit dates in 2018 Negotiations are taking place between the UK and the EU ahead of the UK's scheduled exit in March 2019. Ahead of a week of key meetings, Theresa May is facing growing calls to set out in detail what she wants to secure - in particular how closely-bound the UK will be to the EU after it leaves. Writing inthe Sunday Telegraph,external,  Bernard Jenkin, a Conservative MP who was a key Leave campaigner, accused the government of being ""vague"" and ""divided"" on the issue. But Ms Rudd told Andrew Marr she had ""a surprise for the Brexiteers"", that the key Brexit committee of ministers was ""more united than they think"". The cabinet agrees on the need for ""frictionless trade"", the ability to strike international trade deals and avoid a hard border in Ireland, she said. And on the key point of the customs union - which currently prevents the UK from striking international trade deals - she suggested ""a form of customs agreement"" would be needed. Last week International Trade Secretary Liam Fox said it was ""very difficult"" to see how staying in a customs union would allow the UK to have an ""independent trade policy"" after Brexit. BBC political correspondent Susana Mendonca The accusations of cabinet divisions and disunity have kept coming from Brexit-supporting MPs over the past week. Now the home secretary has pushed back, saying the cabinet is ""more united than they think"". If that is the case, the cabinet will be expected to demonstrate some of that unity this week when discussions between Theresa May, David Davis and EU negotiator Michel Barnier are bound to throw up some bones of contention - the transition deal being the main one. Will the cabinet be singing from the same hymn sheet on that? And what about the customs union, another thorny issue that key ministers have very different views on? To silence its detractors, the cabinet will have to demonstrate this week it is neither ""vague"" nor ""divided"" - but whatever approach it comes up with is likely to lead to divisions with those who think they are going too far or not far enough. The role of the civil service has been thrust into the limelight in recent days by a leaked analysis predicting an economic hit to the UK after Brexit. Ms Rudd said the report did not ""model everything"" and predicted the UK economy would ""absolutely grow"" after Brexit, but said putting up trade barriers would have ""consequences"". Describing the civil service as the envy of the world, she added: ""We have to have these forecasts before making decisions."" She said she had been ""surprised"" at Mr Rees-Mogg's remarks and added that ministerial Brexit colleague Steve Baker - who has clashed with Whitehall unions and apologised to Parliament - had had an ""interesting week"". Mr Baker's apology followed a Commons exchange after which he was accused of not challenging Mr Rees-Mogg's suggestion of Treasury bias against Brexit. On the BBC's Sunday Politics, Conservative Party Chairman Brandon Lewis echoed Ms Rudd in saying Mr Rees-Mogg was wrong and defending Whitehall. Former top civil servants have also hit back at critics. Speaking on ITV's Peston on Sunday, ex-cabinet secretary Lord O'Donnell said claims officials were distorting figures were ""crazy"". People who do not like their analysis tend to shoot the ""messenger"", he said. ""We look at the evidence and we go where it is. ""Of course if you are selling snake oil, you don't like the idea of experts testing your products."" His predecessorAndrew Turnbull, who was cabinet secretary under Tony Blair, told the Observer,externalthat attacks on the civil service were similar to tactics used by German nationalists between the two world wars. BBC business reporter Rob Young Customs union members each apply the same tariff to goods bought from outside the EU. Goods from inside the EU are not subject to tariffs. Theresa May says Britain is leaving the customs union - so what will replace it? For a lot of firms, customs rules are just as important as a trade deal. Brexit could disrupt many supply chains, if businesses buy parts from Germany or Italy, for example. Many exporters want a new customs deal with the EU to reduce the need for border checks - limiting queues and paperwork. But this could restrict Britain's ability to strike international trade deals outside the EU. Some worry this undermines one of the key potential benefits of Brexit. Customs are also key to the future border with Ireland. No wonder this is one of the thorniest issues arising from Brexit. The UK and the EU do not currently agree on whether EU citizens moving to the UK during the planned two-year transition period after Brexit should get the same long-term rights as those who arrive before the UK leaves. Defending the UK's position, Ms Rudd said it was ""right to have a distinction between before March 2019 and afterwards"". Chancellor Philip Hammond has been the focus of much of the criticism from Brexiteers in the Conservative Party, and in his Telegraph article Mr Jenkin suggested Mr Hammond was not toeing the party line. ""If ministers are vague or divided, life for officials becomes impossible, as we can see now. Ministerial collective responsibility really matters,"" he said. He added: ""If the prime minister sticks to one policy and the chancellor keeps advocating another, what are officials meant to do?"" Earlier this month, Mr Hammond suggested the UK's relationship with the EUwould change only ""very modestly"" after Brexit. Mr Jenkin was a leading figure in the Vote Leave campaign But Mr Jenkin urged the prime ministerto stick to her positionand ensure, among other things, Britain leaves the single market and customs union. He wrote: ""She can only command a majority in Parliament on her present policy. ""Her MPs will back her, because we are overwhelmingly at one with the majority of the British people who now want a clean Brexit and an end to the present uncertainty.""

"This video can not be played Lauri Love: Alleged hacker hopes extradition case 'sets a precedent' Alleged computer hacker Lauri Love has won his High Court appeal against his extradition to the US. Mr Love, 33, from Stradishall, Suffolk, was first arrested in October 2013 on suspicion of hacking into FBI, US Central Bank and Nasa systems. Appeal judges said extradition,externalwould be ""oppressive by reason of his physical and mental condition"". They urged the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) to prosecute Mr Love, who has Aspergers syndrome, in England. Lord Chief Justice Lord Burnett and Mr Justice Ouseley said Mr Love, who also has depression, ""did not seek impunity for the acts alleged against him, but contended that he should be tried and, if convicted, sentenced in the United Kingdom"". Lauri Love attended the appeal hearing with his girlfriend Sylvia Mann They said: ""We accept that the evidence shows that the fact of extradition would bring on severe depression, and that Mr Love would probably be determined to commit suicide, here or in America."" Mr Love is alleged to have stolen huge amounts of data from US agencies, including the Federal Reserve, the US army, the defence department, Nasa and the FBI in a spate of online attacks in 2012 and 2013. However, his supporters had warned if he was extradited there was a ""high risk"" he would kill himself. The judges urged the Crown Prosecution Service to work with US authorities because of ""the gravity of the allegations in this case, and the harm done to the victims"". They added that ""if proven, these are serious offences indeed"". The United States authorities now have 14 days to lodge a request for an appeal hearing at the UK Supreme Court. 28 October 2013: Lauri Love isarrested in Suffolkunder the Computer Misuse Act and accused of breaching the security of Nasa and FBI, among other US government agencies. He is released on bail. 27 February 2014: Mr Love is accused of anew chargeof hacking into US Federal Reserve computer servers and stealing the personal information of users. 20 February 2015: Police in the UK say they will not return Mr Love's computer because theycannot decrypt its files. 16 July 2015: Mr Love isre-arrestedby the Met Police executing an extradition warrant on behalf of the US. 20 August 2015: Mr Love tells the BBC he fears he willnot get a fair trialin the US. 10 May 2016: A bid by the National Crime Agency to force Mr Love to hand over encrypted computer passwords isthrown out by a district judgeat Westminster Magistrates' Court. 6 September 2016: Mr Love tells the BBC hefears dying in jail if he is extradited. 16 September 2016: A judge at Westminster Magistrates' Court rules Mr Love should be extradited to the US. 24 October 2016: MPs sign a letter asking President Obama toblock Mr Love's extradition. 14 November 2016: Home Secretary Amber Rudd signs theextradition order. 29 November 2017: The Court of Appealbegins hearing Mr Love's appeal against extradition. Speaking outside the court, Mr Love said he hoped he had set a ""precedent so this will not happen to people in the future"". ""I'm hoping that this outcome can contribute to the discussion we are having as a society about how to accommodate people that have neuro-diversity, whose brains are made up in a slightly different way,"" he said. ""There is an ongoing problem with people with autism in the justice system - they have actually been debating it in Westminster Hall. ""I hope in the future to be able to contribute to a slightly better understanding of the stigma associated with depression."" This video can not be played Lauri Love case 'victory for justice' Supporters warned if Lauri Love was extradited there was a ""high risk"" he would kill himself His father Alexander Love said: ""This is a victory for justice. What makes Great Britain great is that we live in a place with wisdom and compassion."" Authorities in the US have been fighting for Mr Love to face trial on charges of cyber-hacking, which lawyers have said could have meant a sentence of up to 99 years in prison if he was found guilty. The decision to block extradition was met with cheers in the packed London courtroom. A spokesman for Mr Love's solicitors, Kaim Todner, said it was ""important"" the British justice system ""has taken the stance that we should deal with the matter ourselves, rather than accept the US government's demands"". The United States authorities now have 14 days to lodge a request for an appeal hearing at the UK Supreme Court ""It has also been recognised that mental health provisions in US prisons are not adequate to satisfy us that Lauri would not have come to serious harm if he were extradited,"" the statement added. Emma Norton, head of legal casework for campaign group Liberty, said she was ""delighted"" the court had ""recognised Lauri's vulnerability, close family connections to the UK and the potentially catastrophic consequences of extraditing him"". She added: ""This was always a case that could have been prosecuted here and it's shameful that Lauri and his family have been put through this terrible ordeal."" Mr Love's local MP Matt Hancock said: ""It has been a long and hard process for him and his loving family and I'm delighted this verdict has been reached."" A CPS spokesperson said: ""We have received the High Court's judgment on Lauri Love which we will now consider before making any further decisions.""

"Many graduates receive ""paltry returns"" for their degrees despite racking up Â£50,000 in debt, says the chairman of the Education Select Committee. Robert Halfon will say in a speech on Monday, that between a fifth and a third of graduates take non-graduate jobs, and that any extra returns for having a degree ""vary wildly"". He will also suggest that too many people are studying academic degrees. University leaders maintain that a degree remains an excellent investment. In his speech on Monday, Mr Halfon, a former skills minister, will say the nation has ""become obsessed with full academic degrees"". ""We are creating a higher education system that overwhelmingly favours academic degrees, while intermediate and higher technical offerings are comparatively tiny. ""The labour market does not need an ever-growing supply of academic degrees. Between a fifth and a third of our graduates take non-graduate jobs. ""The 'graduate premium' varies wildly according to subject and institution. For many, the returns are paltry."" The degrees that make you rich... and the ones that don't At the Centre for Social Justice, he will say there is an ""enormous opportunity in rebalancing higher education"" and a strong need for intermediate skills. ""There are skills shortages in several sectors. And there are millions of people who want to get on in life - preferably without a lead weight of Â£50,000 dragging from their feet,"" he adds. He suggests: ""If we are going to continue to lavishly furnish universities with taxpayers' money, we need to think about how universities can specialise in these areas. ""Existing universities that do not provide a good return on academic courses could reinvent themselves as centres of technical excellence."" Eight things that were bigger killers in the 70s Uma Thurman breaks silence on Weinstein attack The mystery of the strangled billionaires His comments come as the latest University and College Admissions Service figures show a small drop in the number of people applying to higher education in the UK. Last year 559,030 people, including foreign students, applied to UK universities. This is the lowest number since 2014. A breakdown shows that there were 12,420 fewer UK applicants, a 2.6% drop compared to last year. It is the second annual drop in a row. This video can not be played Five things you should know about your student loan debt Most of this comes from a drop in 18 and 19-year-olds submitting applications, accounting for 70% of the fall in UK applicants, according to Ucas. Alistair Jarvis, chief executive of Universities UK, umbrella organisation for universities, said: ""This small drop in applicant figures can be attributed largely to the fall in the number of 18-year-olds across the UK population. ""This group makes up half of all UK applicants to universities. But the demand for courses from 18-year-olds across the UK remains strong, highlighting the continued demand for university education."" A spokesman for UUK said: ""Official figures are clear that, on average, university graduates continue to earn substantially more than non-graduates and are more likely to be in employment. A university degree remains an excellent investment. ""We must, however, be careful to avoid using graduate salaries as the single measure of success in higher education. Many universities specialise in fields such as the arts, the creative industries, nursing and public sector professions that, despite making an essential contribution to society and the economy, pay less on average."" But there has been growing concern about the amount of debt students are accumulating and the interest being charged on that debt. The government has promised a review of higher education funding in England in response. A spokesperson for the Department for Education said legislation had been introduced to reform higher education to ensure that students and the taxpayer got value for money. ""The government wants everyone to be equipped with the skills they need to get on in life and succeed in the jobs of the future,"" the spokesperson said.

"Sex and the City actress Kim Cattrall has announced the death of her brother, after earlier issuing a public appeal for information on his whereabouts. Christopher Cattrall, 55, had been missing from his home in Alberta, Canada, since Tuesday. Kim Cattrall had appealed to her social media followers for help finding him. His keys, cell phone, and wallet were left on the table, the front door was unlocked, and his seven ""beloved"" dogs were left unattended, she said. ""This is not like Chris... Help us bring him home safe,"" she had asked fans. Later on Sunday, the Liverpool-born actor posted a message on Twitter saying: ""It is with great sadness that myself and my family announce the unexpected passing of our son and brother, Chris Cattrall."" The message thanks those who offered support and asks for privacy. No further details were given.

"President Jacob Zuma is said to be resisting calls to leave office South Africa's ruling party has called a meeting of its top body for Wednesday, amid growing pressure on President Jacob Zuma to stand down. In a statement, the ANC said the meeting would discuss the ""management of the transition"",externalbetween the Zuma administration and the next one. On Monday, senior politicians held an emergency meeting in Johannesburg to discuss Mr Zuma's future. The president has resisted calls to quit over corruption allegations. Mr Zuma, 75, was replaced as party leader by his deputy, Cyril Ramaphosa, 65, in December. Mr Ramaphosa is now the front-runner to succeed him as president. An ANC spokeswoman told Reuters news agency that the removal of President Zuma was not on the agenda at Monday's meeting. The president, in power since 2009, is due to make a state of the nation address on Thursday, and some in the party want Mr Zuma to leave office ahead of that speech. On Wednesday the ANC's National Executive Committee will meet. If the committee agrees to recall Mr Zuma, the BBC's Andrew Harding says, it would be very hard for him to resist.

Other unconfirmed reports from Sunday's meeting say that Mr Zuma asked for protection from prosecution for himself and his family. Mr Zuma's presidency has been overshadowed by allegations of corruption. In recent years his links to the wealthy India-born Gupta family, who are alleged to have influenced the government through their relationship with Mr Zuma, have caused his popularity to plummet. In South Africa, it has become known as ""state capture"". Both Mr Zuma and the Guptas deny the allegations.

This video can not be played Cyril Ramaphosa recently told the BBC's Zeinab Badawi that Jacob Zuma was ""feeling anxious"" As a result, many in the ANC fear his presidency has become toxic - and is hurting the party's standing. That appeared to be borne out at the 2016 local elections, when the ANC lost ground to the opposition Democratic Alliance (DA) and Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF). With a general election set for 2019, the ANC will be keen to distance itself from any more negative press - and therefore it is perhaps not surprising that Mr Ramaphosa was elected the party leader on an anti-corruption platform. However, Mr Zuma still has his supporters within the ANC - including at least two of the top six - so nothing is definite.

"This video can not be played Fran Boait, from campaign group Positive Money, backs Lloyds' move Virgin Money has joined Lloyds Banking Group in banning customers from buying Bitcoin and other digital currencies with their credit cards. Virgin Money's spokesperson said: ""Following a review of our policies, I can confirm customers will no longer be able to use their Virgin Money credit card to purchase crypto-currencies."" Like Lloyds, Virgin's ban only applies to its credit cards, not debit cards. The value of Bitcoin fell a further 10.86% to $7,297.65 on Monday. Like Lloyds, Virgin Money is concerned about customers running up large debts following a sharp fall in the value of digital currencies. Over the weekend, several of the biggest issuers of credit cards in the US also banned customers from using their cards to buy digital currency. The list of financial firms included Bank of America, Citigroup, JP Morgan, Capital One and Discover. Lloyds' ban, starting on Monday, applies to its eight million credit card customers across Lloyds Bank, Bank of Scotland, Halifax and MBNA. Lloyds said it would not be contacting its customers either digitally or through the post to inform customers about the change to its credit card policy. Customers will only be informed should they query a blocked crypto-currency credit card transaction. What is Bitcoin? Lloyds bans Bitcoin credit card buys What's the fuss about Bitcoin? From high school dropout to Bitcoin millionaire Explaining the ban, a Lloyds spokeswoman said: ""We continually review our products and procedures and this is part of that."" The BBC asked other major banks about following Lloyds' move, but none had so far responded. The banking trade organisation UK Finance said it had not released any guidance on the matter. Gillian Guy, the chief executive of Citizens Advice, welcomed the announcement by Lloyds, saying it ""shows they recognise the risks of credit card customers running up debt they can't afford,"" she said. Barclays told the BBC that at present, UK customers are able to use both their Barclays debit cards and Barclaycard credit cards to purchase crypto-currencies. ""We take precautions to assess affordability before extending credit, flag and prevent any suspicious transactions and also closely monitor credit risk,"" a spokeswoman said. Bitcoin ended last week down 30% at $8,291.87 - its worst week since April 2013 and far below the $19,000 it reached last November. However, the crypto-currency is still ahead of the $1,000 it was trading at this time last year. Police have warnedthat digital currencies remain popular among criminals as they can use them to evade traditional money laundering checks and other regulations. Recent reports from Chinese state media indicate that the Chinese government is seeking to tighten legislation to prevent investors in the country from accessing overseas exchanges to trade in crypto-currencies. Prime Minister Theresa May recently said that action against digital currencies may be required ""precisely because of the way they are used, particularly by criminals"". She told Bloomberg: ""In areas like crypto-currencies, like Bitcoin, we should be looking at these very seriously."" The Treasury said that it intends to update regulation to bring virtual currency platforms into anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing regulation. Facebook recently announcedit would block any advertising that promotes crypto-currency products and services. Lloyds' decision to stop the use of credit cards to buy Bitcoin appears to set a new precedent in banking. Until now, there have been only two things you can't use a credit card for: paying off debt - such as making a mortgage payment - or anything illegal. Most stockbrokers will not allow you to use a credit card to buy shares, but that is their decision, not the bank's. Nevertheless, you can use a credit card to gamble - although that will be treated as a cash loan, with interest charges of up to 30% a year, and additional fees on top. But Lloyds has decided that Bitcoin and other crypto-currencies represent a far bigger risk than gambling. After all, you're buying on credit, so it's the bank that stands to lose if you can't repay the debt. Do you use Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies? Have you made or lost money?

"Whale shark in Isla Mujeres Mexico Scientists say there needs to be more research into the impact of plastic pollution on sharks, whales and rays. A study, in the journalTrends in Ecology and Evolution, says the creatures may be swallowing hundreds of tiny bits of plastic a day. Microplastic pollution has the potential to further reduce the population sizes of the large filter feeders, they say. Yet, there is very little research being carried out into the risks. Researchers from the US, Australia and Italy looked at data on threats to large filter feeders from microplastics. These small plastic pieces less than five millimetres long can be harmful to the ocean and aquatic life. The Gulf of Mexico, the Mediterranean Sea, the Bay of Bengal and the Coral Triangle are priorities for monitoring, according to a review of studies. Manta ray with plastic in Indonesia ""The full magnitude of risks of ingesting microplastics are yet to be fully investigated,"" said Elitza Germanov of Murdoch University, Australia, and researcher at the US Marine Megafauna Foundation. Possible risks include reduced nutritional uptake and damage to the digestive system when microplastics are ingested, she said. In addition, toxin exposure through plastic ingestion could affect many biological processes, such as growth and reproduction, putting filter feeding populations ""under even more strain"", she added. The study argues that large filter feeders, many of which are ""charismatic and economically important species"", should be prioritised for further research into risks from microplastics. Filter feeders swallow hundreds of cubic metres of water a day to capture their food from water, and may take in microplastics during the process. Microplastics are similar in size and mass to many types of plankton. Manta ray, a giant of the ocean, swimming amongst plastic Studies have shown chemicals associated with plastics in the bodies of whale sharks and fin whales. ""Our studies on whale sharks in the Sea of Cortez and on fin whales in the Mediterranean Sea confirmed exposure to toxic chemicals, indicating that these filter feeders are taking up microplastics in their feeding grounds,"" said co-researcher Prof Maria Fossi of the University of Siena in Italy. ""Exposure to these plastic-associated toxins pose a major threat to the health of these animals since it can alter the hormones, which regulate the body's growth and development, metabolism, and reproductive functions, among other things."" Seven charts that explain the plastic pollution problem Whale sharks feeding in the Sea of Cortez off Mexico's Baja Peninsula, which is an important breeding ground, are estimated to ingest under 200 pieces of plastic per day. Fin whales in the Mediterranean Sea are thought to be swallowing closer to 2,000 microplastic particles per day. Microplastics under the microscope The researchers say there have been reports of 800kg of plastic found in the carcass of a stranded whale in France and another in Australia contained six square metres of plastic sheeting as well as 30 whole plastic carrier bags. The report highlights several key coastal regions for research and monitoring within the habitat ranges of the animals, including the Coral Triangle, the Gulf of Mexico, the Mediterranean Sea, the Bay of Bengal and other areas that have high microplastic concentration levels, such as the world's five oceanic gyres. Whale sharks and other flagship species may act as a focal point for research, especially in countries that rely on wildlife tourism, say the researchers. This video can not be played A giant build-up of plastic was captured by underwater photographer Caroline Power ""It is worth highlighting that utilising these iconic species, such as whale sharks, manta rays and whales to gain the attention of and engage with communities, policy makers and managers will go far to enhance stewardship of entire marine ecosystems,"" said Ms Germanov, who is a PhD student at Murdoch University. A number of filter-feeding sharks, rays and whales are on the edge of extinction. Many are long-lived and give birth to few offspring during their lives. The whale shark, for example, is listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List. Found in tropical and warm temperate waters, it is the largest fish in the world, yet feeds on tiny plankton, crustaceans and small fish. Follow Helenon Twitter,external.

"This video can not be played Fran Boait, from campaign group Positive Money, backs Lloyds' move Virgin Money has joined Lloyds Banking Group in banning customers from buying Bitcoin and other digital currencies with their credit cards. Virgin Money's spokesperson said: ""Following a review of our policies, I can confirm customers will no longer be able to use their Virgin Money credit card to purchase crypto-currencies."" Like Lloyds, Virgin's ban only applies to its credit cards, not debit cards. The value of Bitcoin fell a further 10.86% to $7,297.65 on Monday. Like Lloyds, Virgin Money is concerned about customers running up large debts following a sharp fall in the value of digital currencies. Over the weekend, several of the biggest issuers of credit cards in the US also banned customers from using their cards to buy digital currency. The list of financial firms included Bank of America, Citigroup, JP Morgan, Capital One and Discover. Lloyds' ban, starting on Monday, applies to its eight million credit card customers across Lloyds Bank, Bank of Scotland, Halifax and MBNA. Lloyds said it would not be contacting its customers either digitally or through the post to inform customers about the change to its credit card policy. Customers will only be informed should they query a blocked crypto-currency credit card transaction. What is Bitcoin? Lloyds bans Bitcoin credit card buys What's the fuss about Bitcoin? From high school dropout to Bitcoin millionaire Explaining the ban, a Lloyds spokeswoman said: ""We continually review our products and procedures and this is part of that."" The BBC asked other major banks about following Lloyds' move, but none had so far responded. The banking trade organisation UK Finance said it had not released any guidance on the matter. Gillian Guy, the chief executive of Citizens Advice, welcomed the announcement by Lloyds, saying it ""shows they recognise the risks of credit card customers running up debt they can't afford,"" she said. Barclays told the BBC that at present, UK customers are able to use both their Barclays debit cards and Barclaycard credit cards to purchase crypto-currencies. ""We take precautions to assess affordability before extending credit, flag and prevent any suspicious transactions and also closely monitor credit risk,"" a spokeswoman said. Bitcoin ended last week down 30% at $8,291.87 - its worst week since April 2013 and far below the $19,000 it reached last November. However, the crypto-currency is still ahead of the $1,000 it was trading at this time last year. Police have warnedthat digital currencies remain popular among criminals as they can use them to evade traditional money laundering checks and other regulations. Recent reports from Chinese state media indicate that the Chinese government is seeking to tighten legislation to prevent investors in the country from accessing overseas exchanges to trade in crypto-currencies. Prime Minister Theresa May recently said that action against digital currencies may be required ""precisely because of the way they are used, particularly by criminals"". She told Bloomberg: ""In areas like crypto-currencies, like Bitcoin, we should be looking at these very seriously."" The Treasury said that it intends to update regulation to bring virtual currency platforms into anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing regulation. Facebook recently announcedit would block any advertising that promotes crypto-currency products and services. Lloyds' decision to stop the use of credit cards to buy Bitcoin appears to set a new precedent in banking. Until now, there have been only two things you can't use a credit card for: paying off debt - such as making a mortgage payment - or anything illegal. Most stockbrokers will not allow you to use a credit card to buy shares, but that is their decision, not the bank's. Nevertheless, you can use a credit card to gamble - although that will be treated as a cash loan, with interest charges of up to 30% a year, and additional fees on top. But Lloyds has decided that Bitcoin and other crypto-currencies represent a far bigger risk than gambling. After all, you're buying on credit, so it's the bank that stands to lose if you can't repay the debt. Do you use Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies? Have you made or lost money?

"Hugh Grant and Crimewatch presenter Jacqui Hames, who also settled a phone-hacking claim against another newspaper, speaking after the hearing in London Actor Hugh Grant has settled a phone-hacking damages claim against Mirror Group Newspapers at the High Court. It is understood the star will be paid a six-figure sum, which he will donate to the campaign group Hacked Off. The actor said the newspaper group had been guilty of phone hacking on an ""industrial scale"" and called for another public inquiry to ""get to the truth"". MGN said it ""deeply regretted"" the acts and described them as ""morally wrong"". Grant, 57, appeared at the court in London to hear his lawyer give details of the hacking settlement. Anjlee Saigol told Mr Justice Mann the action against the Mirror Group related to the alleged illegal misuse of Grant's information obtained by hacking his voicemails, masquerading as other people, and surveillance. The action related to employees at all three of MGN newspapers - the Daily Mirror, Sunday Mirror and Sunday People. As part of Monday's settlement, MGN admitted that senior employees including its editors, executives and journalists ""condoned, encouraged or actively turned a blind eye"" to the culture of phone-hacking, lawyer Ms Saigol said. The offences took place between 1998 and 2009 under the editorships of Piers Morgan and Richard Wallace at the Daily Mirror and Tina Weaver at the Sunday Mirror. The three former editors, along with ex-chief executive of Trinity Mirror Sly Bailey, had previously given evidence to the Leveson Inquiry and denied knowledge of phone hacking at MGN. Their statements to the inquiry were later found to be ""wrong, not just disingenuous"" in a court ruling in 2015. Speaking outside court after Monday's hearing, Grant said: ""This case was not just about what they did to my phone and those close to me. ""In this litigation my lawyer and I pressed further because I was determined to uncover the truth about the nature of high-level concealment at the Mirror Group. Hugh Grant arriving at the Rolls Building in central London for the High Court hearing. ""This litigation has made clear that phone hacking and other unlawful information-gathering took place on an industrial scale at the Daily Mirror, Sunday Mirror and Sunday People.

""That is why the second part of the Leveson Inquiry must take place - to get to the truth and discover who broke the law and who lied about it."" Grant's lawyer Anjlee Saigol added one of Grant's main reasons for pursuing the case was to establish the truth about the group's investigations and knowledge of its unlawful activities before it admitted them in September 2014. She also said the company ""actively sought to conceal its wrongdoing from its many victims of intrusion"" and admitted intrusions into people's lives could have been prevented. On Monday, the judge also heard details of settlements against MGN by actor Ralf Little and Rupert Lowe, who was the executive chairman and joint managing director of Southampton Football Club between 1999 and 2006. Former police officer and Crimewatch presenter Jacqui Hames also settled her action against News Group Newspapers, publishers of the News of the World. Speaking for MGN, Alex Wilson said: ""MGN accepts that the unlawful interception of voicemail messages and procurement of private information about Mr Grant and others should never have happened. ""MGN acknowledges that was morally wrong and deeply regrets the wrongful acts of its former employees which caused damage and distress to those affected, including Mr Grant.""

"The government says it will propose an ""innovative and untested approach"" to customs checks as part of its Brexit negotiations. The model, one of two being put forwardin a newly-published paper,external, would mean no customs checks at UK-EU borders. The UK's alternative proposal - a more efficient system of border checks - would involve ""an increase in administration"", it admits. A key EU figure said the idea of ""invisible borders"" was a ""fantasy"". On Twitter, Guy Verhofstadt, the European Parliament's negotiator, added that other issues had to be agreed before negotiations on trade could begin - views echoed by the EU's overall chief negotiator, Michel Barnier. Government to unveil Irish border plan Analysis: Is UK leaving the customs union? Customs union, free trade area and single market - an explainer The UK has already said it will leave the customs union - the EU's tariff-free trading area - after Brexit, and businesses have been calling for clarity on what the replacement system will involve. The UK's proposals, detailed in what it calls a ""future partnership paper"", also include the possibility of a ""temporary customs union"" after the UK leaves the EU in March 2019 to avoid a ""cliff-edge"" for business as they adapt to the new arrangements. Countries in the customs union don't impose tariffs - taxes on imports - on each other's goods. Every country inside the union levies the same tariffs on imports from abroad. So, for example, a 10% tariff is imposed on some cars imported from outside the customs union, while 7.5% is imposed on roasted coffee. Other goods - such as soap or slate - have no tariffs. The UK has said it is leaving the EU's customs union because as a member it is unable to strike trade deals with other countries. A quick guide to the Brexit negotiations Farmers back temporary customs union According to the new paper, the UK could ask Brussels to establish a ""temporary customs union"" after it leaves the EU in March 2019. But during this period, it would also expect to be able to negotiate its own international trade deals - something it cannot do as an EU customs union member. Ministers said the use of interim arrangements would mean businesses would only have to adjust once to the new arrangements. Once this period expires, the UK will look to agree either a ""highly streamlined"" border with the EU, or a new ""partnership"" with no customs border at all. Reality Check: The UK's customs union proposals The ""partnership"" arrangement would be an ""innovative and untested approach"" which would remove the need for any customs checks between the UK and the EU. This would be because the UK's regime would ""align precisely"" with the EU's, for goods that will be consumed in the EU. However, the UK would continue to operate its own checks on goods coming from outside the EU - and the government said safeguards would be needed to prevent goods entering the EU that had not complied with its rules. These could include a repayment mechanism, which would see importers to the UK pay whichever is the higher tariff, Britain's or the EU's, and then face having to claim money back if their goods were sold to a customer in the region with a lower tariff. Brexit Secretary David Davis (left) and the EU Commission's Michel Barnier are leading the negotiations for the two sides An alternative scenario the government is proposing would involve the UK extending customs checks to EU arrivals - but under a ""highly streamlined arrangement"" to minimise disruption at ports and airports. It said it would seek to make the existing system of customs checks ""even more efficient"", for example using number plate recognition technology at ports, which could be linked to customs declarations for what the vehicles are carrying, meaning the vehicles do not have to be manually stopped and checked. The UK would also allow some traders to do self assessment, calculating their own customs duties. However, the government acknowledged this option would still involve ""an increase in administration"" compared with being in the existing customs union. All of this will have to be negotiated with the EU - and the two sides have not yet even started discussing trade matters. Other obstacles - including the size of the UK's ""divorce bill"" - need to be agreed first. The government will also set up its own ""standalone"" system in the event of no deal being reached, which would involve charging customs duty and VAT on imports from the EU, although it says it is keen to avoid this scenario. Previous estimates by HMRC have predicted a sudden increase in the number of customs declarations after Brexit - subject to any new arrangements agreed with the EU - from a maximum of 55 million to 255 million per year. Can technology offer frictionless borders? This video can not be played David Davis tells Today Brexit is going ""incredibly well"" David Davis, Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union, said he envisioned the interim customs system being ""as close as we can to the current arrangements"", but with the UK able to negotiate and sign its own international trade deals. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, he did not rule out the UK paying to be part of the arrangement, saying he was not going to conduct negotiations on air. And he said he did not believe the European Court of Justice would be the arbiter of the temporary arrangement, adding that the government would publish proposals on ""international arbitration"" next week. Mr Davis said the transition period should be ""something like two years, maybe a bit shorter"" but that it had ""to be done by the election"", meaning 2022 at the latest. Analysis by the BBC's Eleanor Garnier Philip Hammond and Liam Fox were on opposite sides of last year's EU referendum debate These proposals are designed to demonstrate unity - after reported cabinet splits - and show the government has a plan in place. Chancellor Philip Hammond has got his way in seeking an interim customs arrangement as much like the status quo as possible. And Liam Fox could potentially win the right to negotiate international trade deals during the transition period. But this is about much more than domestic political battles - it's about whether the UK can succeed in getting Brussels negotiators to talk about trade at the same time as the so-called divorce arrangements, something they have steadfastly refused to do so far. The EU is also working on a position paper on the customs union. Its chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, tweeted that customs could not be discussed until the Irish border, citizens' rights and the UK's separation payment had been settled. A European Commission spokesman added: ""As Michel Barnier has said on several occasions, 'frictionless trade' is not possible outside the single market and customs union."" Allow Twitter content?

Sir Keir Starmer, Labour's shadow Brexit secretary, said the proposals were ""incoherent and inadequate"" and were designed to ""gloss over deep and continuing divisions within the cabinet"". But his party also faced questions on its position. Speaking to Emma Barnett on BBC Radio 5 live, shadow international trade minister Bill Esterson would not say whether Labour would remain in the customs union after March 2019. Asked repeatedly, he said Labour would seek ""the same relationship that we have now"". ""The detail of whether it's defined as being membership or not isn't the point,"" he added. This video can not be played Shadow International Trade Minister asked five times about leaving customs union. Scotland's first minister Nicola Sturgeon accused the UK of a ""daft have cake and eat it"" approach. Pro-EU Conservative MP Anna Soubry said ministers were ""moving in the right direction"" with their proposals for an interim arrangement. But she said they should admit that ""no new agreement with the EU can fully replace the benefits of customs union membership"". Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable accused ministers of ""kicking the can down the road"" and argued for staying in the customs union. But the CBI, which represents British businesses, said the proposal was ""encouraging"". Its deputy director general, Josh Hardie, added: ""The clock is ticking and what matters now is giving companies the confidence to continue investing as quickly as possible."" Adam Marshall, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, said most businesses were more concerned about future customs arrangements with the EU than future trade deals. ""In the long term, we should aim to avoid imports and exports being subjected to two sets of customs checks, and to ensuring the smoothest possible future trade relationship between the UK and EU."" This video can not be played ""We need a much more hard nosed approach...as it's very difficult to see the EU from budging"" says ex UKIP leader MEP and former UKIP leader Nigel Farage attacked the government's proposals.

""There's no doubt that during this transitional period, the free movement of people will continue, the European Court of Justice will go on having judgements over British business and, of course, we'll go on paying a membership fee.

"Manchester Royal Infirmary is one of the hospitals affected Operations were cancelled at four hospitals in Manchester due to a mains leak affecting the water supply. Hospitals affected by Sunday's leak were the Royal Infirmary, the Royal Eye Hospital, Saint Mary's Hospital and Royal Manchester Children's Hospital. Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust said non-urgent operations were cancelled this morning but resumed this afternoon as the supply was restored. An affected patient's grandson took 200 bottles of water to help ill patients. The trust said cancelled operations will be rescheduled as soon as possible. One patient tweeted about the effects on patients, calling it a ""shocking situation"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Hugh Grant and Crimewatch presenter Jacqui Hames, who also settled a phone-hacking claim against another newspaper, speaking after the hearing in London Actor Hugh Grant has settled a phone-hacking damages claim against Mirror Group Newspapers at the High Court. It is understood the star will be paid a six-figure sum, which he will donate to the campaign group Hacked Off. The actor said the newspaper group had been guilty of phone hacking on an ""industrial scale"" and called for another public inquiry to ""get to the truth"". MGN said it ""deeply regretted"" the acts and described them as ""morally wrong"". Grant, 57, appeared at the court in London to hear his lawyer give details of the hacking settlement. Anjlee Saigol told Mr Justice Mann the action against the Mirror Group related to the alleged illegal misuse of Grant's information obtained by hacking his voicemails, masquerading as other people, and surveillance. The action related to employees at all three of MGN newspapers - the Daily Mirror, Sunday Mirror and Sunday People. As part of Monday's settlement, MGN admitted that senior employees including its editors, executives and journalists ""condoned, encouraged or actively turned a blind eye"" to the culture of phone-hacking, lawyer Ms Saigol said. The offences took place between 1998 and 2009 under the editorships of Piers Morgan and Richard Wallace at the Daily Mirror and Tina Weaver at the Sunday Mirror. The three former editors, along with ex-chief executive of Trinity Mirror Sly Bailey, had previously given evidence to the Leveson Inquiry and denied knowledge of phone hacking at MGN. Their statements to the inquiry were later found to be ""wrong, not just disingenuous"" in a court ruling in 2015. Speaking outside court after Monday's hearing, Grant said: ""This case was not just about what they did to my phone and those close to me. ""In this litigation my lawyer and I pressed further because I was determined to uncover the truth about the nature of high-level concealment at the Mirror Group. Hugh Grant arriving at the Rolls Building in central London for the High Court hearing. ""This litigation has made clear that phone hacking and other unlawful information-gathering took place on an industrial scale at the Daily Mirror, Sunday Mirror and Sunday People. ""This newspaper group has misled the public and its shareholders for many years; and it has let down its readers and its hard-working journalists. Allow Twitter content?

""The public were not told the truth, the victims were not told the truth, the shareholders were not told the truth and the Leveson Inquiry was not told the truth."" ""That is why the second part of the Leveson Inquiry must take place - to get to the truth and discover who broke the law and who lied about it."" Grant's lawyer Anjlee Saigol added one of Grant's main reasons for pursuing the case was to establish the truth about the group's investigations and knowledge of its unlawful activities before it admitted them in September 2014. She also said the company ""actively sought to conceal its wrongdoing from its many victims of intrusion"" and admitted intrusions into people's lives could have been prevented. On Monday, the judge also heard details of settlements against MGN by actor Ralf Little and Rupert Lowe, who was the executive chairman and joint managing director of Southampton Football Club between 1999 and 2006. Former police officer and Crimewatch presenter Jacqui Hames also settled her action against News Group Newspapers, publishers of the News of the World. Speaking for MGN, Alex Wilson said: ""MGN accepts that the unlawful interception of voicemail messages and procurement of private information about Mr Grant and others should never have happened. ""MGN acknowledges that was morally wrong and deeply regrets the wrongful acts of its former employees which caused damage and distress to those affected, including Mr Grant."" The newspaper has been taken to court multiple times over claims of phone-hacking. In October last year, comedianSteve Coogan was the latest in a long list of more than 40 celebrities to have settled phone-hacking claimsagainst MGN. They include Lord Archer, footballer Kevin Keegan and actresses Patsy Kensit and Michelle Collins. Grant, who is known for films including Notting Hill and Four Weddings and a Funeral, has been one of the leading voices in the campaign for stricter press regulation. In 2012 heaccepted a ""substantial sum"" in damages from the now-defunct News of the World. Grant was one of the victims of the paper's widespread phone hacking, which led to its closure in 2011. He gave evidence at the Leveson Inquiry into press ethics, set up following the News of the World phone-hacking scandal. Grant accepts sum over phone hacking.

"This video can not be played A rally was held in London at the weekend calling for more funding for the NHS A new ring-fenced tax to fund the NHS and social care has been proposed by a panel of health experts. The panel, set up by the Liberal Democrats, says the NHS in England should be given an extra Â£4bn on top of inflation in the next financial year. It has suggested replacing National Insurance with the new tax to close the funding gap. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said NHS funding ""is at a record high"". ""[It] was prioritised in the Budget with an extra Â£2.8bn, on top of the additional Â£2bn already provided for social care over the next three years, and an additional Â£437m of funding for winter,"" the spokesperson said. The future of NHS money has been hotly debated as hospitals struggle to cope with the pressure on resources. Last month, tens of thousands ofnon-urgent operations were delayed. NHS Tracker: Check key targets in your area The good A&E struggling to cope 'I'm really sad I can't be an NHS nurse' The 10-member panel included former NHS England chief executive Sir David Nicholson, Peter Carter, former chief executive of the Royal College of Nursing and Clare Gerada, former chairwoman of the Royal College of GPs. It said on top of the Â£4bn extra needed for next year, an additional Â£2.5bn would be required for both 2019 and 2020. Prof Gerada said that one of the issues is that working people over the age of 60 benefit from a significantly reduced National Insurance contribution, and people over 65 do not pay it at all. She said National Insurance, which currently funds the NHS and social care, is inadequate as older people are living longer, and not contributing to the ring-fenced tax. She said: ""Old age is now between 85 and 95, so old age has significantly moved. ""Why shouldn't I pay for my fair share of contributions if I'm working?"" As part of the recommendations, the panel also suggested reinstating a cap on the costs paid by individuals on social care. In December, the governmentscrapped proposals to cap feesat Â£72,500. It supported creating an office for budget responsibility for health and called for a series of incentives to get people to save more towards their adult social care. The idea of a levy dedicated to funding the NHS was also suggested byformer minister Nick Boles.

"Salah Abdeslam is refusing to co-operate with the court The sole surviving suspect from the 2015 Paris terror attacks refused to speak any further in a Belgian court, where his trial over the gunfight that led to his arrest began on Monday. Salah Abdeslam said he would not respond to questions from the judge. ""My silence does not make me a criminal, it's my defence,"" he said. Abdeslam, 28, claimed that Muslims were ""judged and treated in the worst of ways, mercilessly"", and said he was placing his trust in Allah. ""I am not afraid of you, I am not afraid of your allies,"" he added, without making clear who he meant. He urged the prosecution to base its case on ""forensic and tangible evidence"", and not to ""swagger about to satisfy public opinion"". The trial in Brussels was adjourned until Thursday. Abdeslam was arrested in March 2016 after a shootout with police in Brussels Abdeslam has refused to speak to investigators since his initial interrogation in March 2016. French prosecutors believe Abdeslam played a key role in the Paris attacks, in which gunmen and suicide bombers targeted a concert hall, stadium, restaurants and bars, killing 130 people and injuring hundreds more. He became Europe's most wanted man after the mass killings, and was captured in Brussels four months later. The defendant's brother, Brahim, was among the Paris attackers and died in a suicide blast outside a cafe. Five things to know about Salah Abdeslam Paris and Brussels bombers' links uncovered Abdeslam is not expected to go on trial in France until 2019 at the earliest. The charges he faces in Brussels are not related to events in Paris, but to a shootout with police while he was on the run in Belgium. This video can not be played Damian Grammaticas reports from the scene of the raid Abdeslam and his suspected accomplice Sofien Ayari, 24, are accused of possessing illegal weapons and the attempted murder of police officers in a terrorist context. The men allegedly fought a gun battle with officers who raided the flat where they were holed up, in the Molenbeek district of Brussels. The Belgian prosecutor, Kathleen Grosjean, said she was seeking the maximum of 20 years' imprisonment for each of them. Is Molenbeek a hotbed of extremism? In court on Monday, Ayari said he had fought for the jihadist group Islamic State (IS) in Syria, and that both he and Abdeslam were present during the standoff. The prosecutor has said she does not believe Abdeslam actually fired any weapons. She explained that two Kalashnikovs had been used during the clash. The first shooter is known to be Algerian national Mohamed Belkaid, who was subsequently shot by special police. The prosecution believes the second shooter is Ayari due to DNA found on the weapon. However, this would not affect Abdeslam's potential sentence, due to the ""indispensable aid"" he allegedly gave Ayari and Belkaid. A courtroom sketch of Abdeslam, who is refusing to have pictures or video taken of him Salah Abdeslam entered the court silently, all eyes trained on him. On either side of Abdeslam stood police guards wearing balaclavas. The photographs released by police during the four-month manhunt for him following the Paris attacks had shown a clean-shaven young man with short-cropped hair. Now his hair was longer, almost shoulder length. In prison he's also grown a beard. The old photos showed a slim, seemingly relaxed-looking man, the air of a swagger about him. Now he moved a little hesitantly. He said nothing. When the judge asked him to confirm his identity Abdeslam, wearing a white jacket, did not respond. She asked again. He had to be coaxed to acknowledge his own name. The judge explained to the court that Abdeslam did not want his picture to be shown, so any filming of him was prohibited. The man who prosecutors say was a willing part of a murderous gang that killed 130 people in Paris was unwilling now to show his face, or even to speak up in front of the court. He has also refused to talk to prosecutors, or even lawyers representing him. As his co-accused Sofien Ayari stood to answer questions about his time in Syria, and the automatic weapons they had kept in a flat in Brussels, Abdeslam sat in silence. For now he seems determined to divulge nothing about his role, or anything else connected to the attacks. Abdeslam is being transported between a French prison and a Belgian court for this trial Abdeslam, a French citizen born to Moroccan parents in Brussels, has been held at a prison near Paris. He left the facility under armed guard in the early hours of Monday, accompanied by tactical police vehicles. He will return to France every night during the trial, but will be held at another jail just across the border. Up to 200 police will be guarding the courthouse for the trial. The right to silence is protected by the European Convention on Human Rights, but it is not an absolute right. European human rights law says a defendant's decision to remain silent can be taken into account when assessing the prosecution's evidence.,externalThat is especially so ""in situations which clearly call for an explanation from him [the defendant]"". Observers say that given other suspects have spoken and co-operated with the police, Abdeslam's silence won't necessarily hurt the prosecution's case. But if he remains silent on the Paris attacks too, it would ""be horrible for the victims' families"", said Guy Van Vlierden, a Belgian journalist specialising in security and terrorism issues. Three explosions outside the Stade de France stadium in the north of Paris on 13 November 2015 as suicide attackers were prevented from entering. Minutes later, several people were killed asshootings and bombings took place around bars and restaurants, including the cafe-bar Le Carillon, in the centre of town. The worst attack of the night occurred at the Bataclan concert hall.Eighty-nine people were killed as attackers with suicide belts fired assault rifles into the crowd.

"Many graduates receive ""paltry returns"" for their degrees despite racking up Â£50,000 in debt, says the chairman of the Education Select Committee. Robert Halfon will say in a speech on Monday, that between a fifth and a third of graduates take non-graduate jobs, and that any extra returns for having a degree ""vary wildly"". He will also suggest that too many people are studying academic degrees. University leaders maintain that a degree remains an excellent investment. In his speech on Monday, Mr Halfon, a former skills minister, will say the nation has ""become obsessed with full academic degrees"". ""We are creating a higher education system that overwhelmingly favours academic degrees, while intermediate and higher technical offerings are comparatively tiny. ""The labour market does not need an ever-growing supply of academic degrees. Between a fifth and a third of our graduates take non-graduate jobs. ""The 'graduate premium' varies wildly according to subject and institution. For many, the returns are paltry."" The degrees that make you rich... and the ones that don't At the Centre for Social Justice, he will say there is an ""enormous opportunity in rebalancing higher education"" and a strong need for intermediate skills. ""There are skills shortages in several sectors. And there are millions of people who want to get on in life - preferably without a lead weight of Â£50,000 dragging from their feet,"" he adds. He suggests: ""If we are going to continue to lavishly furnish universities with taxpayers' money, we need to think about how universities can specialise in these areas. ""Existing universities that do not provide a good return on academic courses could reinvent themselves as centres of technical excellence."" Eight things that were bigger killers in the 70s Uma Thurman breaks silence on Weinstein attack The mystery of the strangled billionaires His comments come as the latest University and College Admissions Service figures show a small drop in the number of people applying to higher education in the UK. Last year 559,030 people, including foreign students, applied to UK universities. This is the lowest number since 2014. A breakdown shows that there were 12,420 fewer UK applicants, a 2.6% drop compared to last year. It is the second annual drop in a row. This video can not be played Five things you should know about your student loan debt Most of this comes from a drop in 18 and 19-year-olds submitting applications, accounting for 70% of the fall in UK applicants, according to Ucas. Alistair Jarvis, chief executive of Universities UK, umbrella organisation for universities, said: ""This small drop in applicant figures can be attributed largely to the fall in the number of 18-year-olds across the UK population. ""This group makes up half of all UK applicants to universities. But the demand for courses from 18-year-olds across the UK remains strong, highlighting the continued demand for university education."" A spokesman for UUK said: ""Official figures are clear that, on average, university graduates continue to earn substantially more than non-graduates and are more likely to be in employment. A university degree remains an excellent investment. ""We must, however, be careful to avoid using graduate salaries as the single measure of success in higher education. Many universities specialise in fields such as the arts, the creative industries, nursing and public sector professions that, despite making an essential contribution to society and the economy, pay less on average."" But there has been growing concern about the amount of debt students are accumulating and the interest being charged on that debt. The government has promised a review of higher education funding in England in response. A spokesperson for the Department for Education said legislation had been introduced to reform higher education to ensure that students and the taxpayer got value for money. ""The government wants everyone to be equipped with the skills they need to get on in life and succeed in the jobs of the future,"" the spokesperson said.

"The customs union has become a key part of the Brexit negotiations - so what is it and why does it matter? Acustoms union,externalis a form of trade agreement between two or more countries. It means they decide not to impose tariffs (taxes on imports) on each other's goods and agree to impose common external tariffs on goods from countries outside their customs union. Setting common external tariffs is what distinguishes acustoms union from a free trade area,external. A free trade area allows member states to trade feely with each other while still being able to set their own tariffs on goods from the rest of the world. The purpose of a customs union, like that of other trade agreements, is to make it easier for member states to trade. Customs unions reduce administrative and financial trade barriers (such as customs checks and charges) and enhance economic cooperation. However, they also limit the freedom of their individual members to strike their own trade deals. The European Union is the biggest customs union in the world if you work it out by adding up the economic output of all its members. Article 28 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union states that all trade in goods between EU countries must be free of customs duties and that member states must apply a common customs tariff for goods imported from outside the EU. That means that all goods that have been imported into an EU country can then be moved freely within the EUwithout further customs checks,external. The EU customs union,externalincludes the 28 EU member states as well as Monaco. The EU also has customs union agreements - which vary in scope, such as type of goods covered - withTurkey, Andorra and San Marino,external. So, you do not have to be a member of the EU's single market to be in a customs union with the EU. Norway, on the other hand, is part of the European Economic Area (EEA), which gives it access to the single market,but is not in the EU's customs union,external. In practice, this means that while most goods that originate in Norway can still be traded tariff-free to the rest of the European single market, products coming through Norway into the single market are subject to further checks. There are some customs checks on the border between Norway and Sweden even though they are both part of the single market, to check for products originating outside Norway. A good example of this was theattempts to smuggle garlic into Sweden. The customs union can be seen as one tool to help achieve one of the four freedoms of the EU, namely free trade in goods between member states. The remaining three freedoms - free movement of services, capital and people - help tackle non-tariff barriers, which is vital in boosting trade, particularly in services. Trade in services is arguably more important to the UK than trade in goods, as services make up almost 80% of the UK economy. A customs union would have limited impact on trade in services. The government has said it will take the UK out of the European Union. However, exactly what this will mean is still not clear. Whether to remove itself from the EU's customs union will not be the only question to decide on in order to shape the UK's trade relationships outside the EU. Supporters of the customs union point out that if the UK were to leave it, there would be much more paperwork for UK businesses to fill out, and it could make the border issues involving Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic more complicated. On the other hand, those wanting to leave the customs union say it would make it easier to negotiate trade deals with countries outside the union.

"President Jacob Zuma is said to be resisting calls to leave office South Africa's ruling party has called a meeting of its top body for Wednesday, amid growing pressure on President Jacob Zuma to stand down. In a statement, the ANC said the meeting would discuss the ""management of the transition"",externalbetween the Zuma administration and the next one. On Monday, senior politicians held an emergency meeting in Johannesburg to discuss Mr Zuma's future. The president has resisted calls to quit over corruption allegations. Mr Zuma, 75, was replaced as party leader by his deputy, Cyril Ramaphosa, 65, in December. Mr Ramaphosa is now the front-runner to succeed him as president. An ANC spokeswoman told Reuters news agency that the removal of President Zuma was not on the agenda at Monday's meeting. The president, in power since 2009, is due to make a state of the nation address on Thursday, and some in the party want Mr Zuma to leave office ahead of that speech. On Wednesday the ANC's National Executive Committee will meet. If the committee agrees to recall Mr Zuma, the BBC's Andrew Harding says, it would be very hard for him to resist. He might even face a no-confidence motion in parliament the next day, our correspondent adds. Will Zuma be ousted as South Africa's president? Long read: The trials of Jacob Zuma Africa Live: Protesters gather outside ANC headquarters Mr Zuma, who spent time in prison for his part in the fight against apartheid, met the ANC's top six on Sunday. They are said to have failed to convince him to stand aside. Julius Malema, an opposition leader and former ANC member, said on Twitter that Mr Zuma had refused to go early. Allow Twitter content?

Other unconfirmed reports from Sunday's meeting say that Mr Zuma asked for protection from prosecution for himself and his family. Mr Zuma's presidency has been overshadowed by allegations of corruption. In recent years his links to the wealthy India-born Gupta family, who are alleged to have influenced the government through their relationship with Mr Zuma, have caused his popularity to plummet. In South Africa, it has become known as ""state capture"". Both Mr Zuma and the Guptas deny the allegations.

This video can not be played Cyril Ramaphosa recently told the BBC's Zeinab Badawi that Jacob Zuma was ""feeling anxious"" As a result, many in the ANC fear his presidency has become toxic - and is hurting the party's standing. That appeared to be borne out at the 2016 local elections, when the ANC lost ground to the opposition Democratic Alliance (DA) and Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF). With a general election set for 2019, the ANC will be keen to distance itself from any more negative press - and therefore it is perhaps not surprising that Mr Ramaphosa was elected the party leader on an anti-corruption platform. However, Mr Zuma still has his supporters within the ANC - including at least two of the top six - so nothing is definite. On Monday, there were scuffles out the ANC headquarters between small groups of pro- and anti-Zuma supporters.

"Manchester Royal Infirmary is one of the hospitals affected Operations were cancelled at four hospitals in Manchester due to a mains leak affecting the water supply. Hospitals affected by Sunday's leak were the Royal Infirmary, the Royal Eye Hospital, Saint Mary's Hospital and Royal Manchester Children's Hospital. Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust said non-urgent operations were cancelled this morning but resumed this afternoon as the supply was restored. An affected patient's grandson took 200 bottles of water to help ill patients. The trust said cancelled operations will be rescheduled as soon as possible.

"A key pay factor was women working part-time in motherhood, the report suggests Mothers in part-time jobs are being hit by a ""pay penalty"" and are often not given pay rises linked to experience, a new study has suggested. The Institute for Fiscal Studies report found by the time a couple's first child is aged 20, many mothers earn nearly a third less than the fathers. A key factor was women working part-time in motherhood, the report said. A gender pay gap between graduates has not improved since 1993, despite gaps narrowing for non-graduates, it added. What is the gender pay gap? Gender pay gap and equal pay: What's the difference? Gender pay gap 'widens as women get older' Should men take a pay cut to reduce gender pay gap? The study, compiled on behalf of the independent Joseph Rowntree Foundation charity, found when women become mothers and start to work part-time they may miss out on the benefits of full-time employment - where experience is rewarded with progression and higher pay. Yasmin Latif from Bow, in London, was a deputy head teacher at an inner city sixth form college. She earned Â£49,000-a-year, but decided to seek part-time work so she could care for her elderly mother. The 49-year-old said: ""You almost lose your status if you go down to part-time work, you're not allowed to be a head of year or a head of department if you're working part-time."" Now she works as a lecturer three days a week for Â£22,000-a-year. ""I earn what I did as a graduate 30 years ago,"" she said. She added that she has had use her life savings in order to pay the bills. ""The effect of part-time work in shutting down wage progression is especially striking,"" the report added. ""Whereas, in general, people in paid work see their pay rise year on year as they gain more experience, our new research shows that part-time workers miss out on these gains."" The vast majority of part-time workers were women, especially mothers of young children, the report said. It said the lack of earnings growth in part-time work particularly affects graduate women, ""because they are the women for whom continuing in full-time paid work would have led to the most wage progression"". One example in the report is that of a graduate who has worked full-time for seven years before having a child. If she continued in full-time work for another year she would on average see her hourly wage rise by 6%. She would see ""none of that wage progression"" if she switched to part-time work instead, say the report authors. This video can not be played Do you know the difference between the gender pay gap and equal pay? Monica Costa Dias, associate director at the IFS and a co-author of the report, said: ""It is remarkable that periods spent in part-time work lead to virtually no wage progression at all."" The report also notes the narrowing of the non-graduate gender pay gap between women and men educated to GCSE-level with the difference in average hourly pay falling from 28% in the early 1990s to about 18% in 2016. The report said this change from 1993 is because ""women in work are now better educated relative to men than they were"". The research shows women with A-levels have seen the wage gap close from 29% in 1993 to around 22%. By comparison, it found the average hourly wages of men and women with degrees differed by 22% in 2016 - compared with 21% in 1993. Robert Joyce, associate director at the IFS and co-author of the report, said: ""Traditionally it has been lower-educated women whose wages were especially low relative to similarly educated men. ""It is now the highest-educated women whose wages are the furthest behind their male counterparts - and this is particularly related to the fact that they lose out so badly from working part-time."" The report said a key challenge for future research was to understand why part-time work shuts down wage progression so much. ""There are a number of possibilities, including less training provision, missing out on informal interactions and networking opportunities, and genuine constraints placed upon the build-up of skill by working fewer hours,"" it said. However, even before women have their first child, the IFS said they were on average being paid 10% less than men. Mr Joyce saidnew legislationthat requires UK companies with more than 250 employees to publish their gender pay gaps ""could be part of the solution"" since women may not be aware that men were being paid more than them. Lynsey Reynolds, Cardiff I went part-time in 2012 after having twins, due to the affordability of childcare. At the time I had a good career in NHS finance. However I was subsequently told by my manager in the NHS that while I was part-time I would never get anywhere working for him. I ended up leaving the NHS to work for a smaller organisation who needed a part-time finance manager. It still rankles that I was forced to choose between motherhood and my career in the NHS. Sharron Wilson, Warwickshire Sharron worked in project management for six years but then decided to pursue a Masters and a PhD. After having two children and completing her studies, she returned to part-time work in administration. The biggest problem is a shortage of well-paid part-time jobs. They are few and far between and when they come out, competition is fierce. I get paid an okay amount, but never see anything part-time the next grade up. So I may have to wait another few years, when the children are older, before going back full-time, and then all the job opportunities will be open to me. Cat McGrann, Kingston-upon-Thames Cat works part-time so she can care for her two young children. She said that her salary has not increased by much. I have a good job with decent pay, but am working a 70% job for Â£500-a-month after nursery fees. If I worked full-time and we needed full-time childcare, it would be Â£300 [after childcare fees]. What was a choice is now a trap. For most families [part-time work] is a financial necessity and women take the hit with diminished careers, missed promotions, lost earnings and lower pensions.

"It is unclear whether Kim Yong-nam, who heads the parliament in Pyongyang, will attend the opening ceremony along with US Vice President Mike Pence North Korea's head of state will go to Pyeongchang this week for the Winter Olympics, the most senior official to ever visit South Korea. North Korea confirmed Kim Yong-nam's attendance at the opening ceremony, set for Friday. Both Koreas will march under one flag at the opening ceremony. Although this signals a thaw in relations between the Koreas, experts say it is unlikely to have any impact on the North's nuclear ambitions. Mr Kim will be in the South for a three-day visit and will lead a 22-member delegation. North v South: A history of sport, bombs and diplomacy How good is North Korea at sport? North Korea crisis in 300 words The 90-year-old Kim Yong-nam has seen the rule of all three North Korean leaders in his career. He is the ceremonial head of state who receives credentials from foreign diplomats in Pyongyang. As such, he is usually responsible for sending condolences or congratulatory messages to foreign leaders. He has been the president of North Korea's rubber-stamp parliament, the Supreme People's Assembly, since 1998. Unlike the current leader Kim Jong-un, Kim Yong-nam has travelled abroad on official visits. In August 2017, he travelled to Iran to attend President Hassan Rouhani's inauguration ceremony for his second term in office. The two Koreas, still technically at war, are separated by a Demilitarised Zone (DMZ) He also attended the opening ceremony of the Winter Olympic Games in Sochi, Russia in 2014. Mr Kim is said to be a loyal follower of the top leadership. ""As Kim is known to be acting and speaking under the country's guidance, he makes no mistakes. That's why he could keep his high-level post in a country where political purges are common,"" South Korea's Yonhap news agency quoted one North Korean defector as saying. An unnamed official from the South's presidential Blue House told the BBC that they believed Mr Kim's visit reflected a willingness on the part of North Korea to improve inter-Korean relations, and demonstrated the North's sincerity. Seoul has said it will seek high-level talks with the North Korean delegation during the visit, Yonhap reported. Mr Kim's attendance at the opening ceremony will also put him in the company of US Vice President Mike Pence, at a point of high tension with Washington over the North's nuclear ambitions. In another development on Sunday, the Washington Post reported thatFred Warmbier, whose son Otto Warmbier was jailed by North Korea and died days after returning to the US, would attend the opening ceremony as a guest of Mr Pence,external. Mr Warmbier and his wife, Cindy, were guests of US President Donald Trump at last week's State of the Union address. North Korea on Monday proposed sending an art troupe to the Games by ferry, a move that would require an exemption from bilateral sanctions. Pyongyang proposed that its delegation use the Mangyongbong 92, a ferry that usually operates between North Korea and Russia, for transportation and as accommodation for the group, according to the South's unification ministry. All North Korean ships have been banned from entering South Korean ports since 2010. ""We're seeking to apply an exemption... to support a successful hosting of the Olympics,"" South Korean ministry spokesman Baik Tae-hyun told a press conference. On Sunday, the united Korean women's ice hockey team played its first match, but lost the friendly against Sweden 1-3. The newly formed joint Korean ice hockey team did not prevail in the friendly against Sweden Sunday's outing was the first and only practice match for the newly minted Korean squad. As well as the ice hockey players, North Korean athletes will compete in skiing and figure skating events. It is also sending hundreds of delegates, cheerleaders and performers. North Korea currently faces growing international pressure and sanctions over its nuclear and missile programmes after it conducted a series of missile tests designed to demonstrate its nuclear capability. North Korea's participation in the Olympics, which run from 9 to 25 February, was an unexpected warming of ties. It came after the hereditary leaderKim Jong-un extended an olive branch to the South in a New Year message, saying he was open to dialogue and could send a team to the Games. However, there have already been some signs of the tensions that underpins this relationship. Earlier this week it emerged that the North had scheduled a large-scale military parade for 8 February, the day before the Winter Olympics commences.

"This video can not be played Timberlake, Eagles & Osi - Super Bowl best moments The Philadelphia Eagles won the Super Bowl for the first time by beating the New England Patriots 41-33 in an extraordinary encounter in Minneapolis. On a night when records tumbled and the expected norms of an NFL game went out the window, the Eagles - led majestically by quarterback Nick Foles - produced a brilliant offensive display to deny the Patriots a record-equalling sixth Super Bowl crown. Zach Ertz's touchdown with less than three minutes remaining put the Eagles into a five-point lead, but it took Brandon Graham's sack on Tom Brady just moments later to seemingly put the game beyond the reigning champions. Even then the Eagles had to withstand a late march downfield by Brady, but victory was finally assured when a Hail Mary attempt came to nothing as the clock ticked down to zero. Relive how the Eagles beat the Patriots in thriller Timberlake touches down at Super Bowl Win sparks mayhem in Philadelphia In a game featuring just one punt and one sack - Graham's key hit on Brady - the action was breathless and, for the most part, unprecedented in NFL history. Chief among the highlights was the glorious moment when Foles - later named the game's Most Valuable Player - caught a pass from tight end Trey Burton on a gutsy trick play, making him the first player ever to throw and catch a touchdown in a Super Bowl. Foles also threw for three touchdowns from 373 passing yards, the 29-year-old Texan capping off his fairytale rise since being drafted in to replace the injured Carson Wentz three games from the end of the regular season. Opposite number Brady, meanwhile, is left to wonder just how he failed to add to his five Super Bowl rings despite 505 passing yards - a Super Bowl record - and three touchdown passes. The explosive nature of the two offenses saw the Eagles and Patriots combine for 1,151 yards in total, a record not just for a Super Bowl but for any regular- or post-season game in NFL history. This video can not be played Watch: The touchdown 'that will be shown a billion times' The Patriots became the first team in NFL history to put up more than 600 yards of offense in a game and lose. The Eagles set a new record for the highest number of points conceded by a winning team in the Super Bowl (33). Brady became the first quarterback in any NFL game to lose after throwing for more than 500 yards, three touchdowns and no interceptions. One sack in the game tied the Super Bowl record. Brady was appearing in his record eighth Super Bowl and was bidding to become the first man in the sport's history to win six times. LeGarrette Blount won the Super Bowl for the second year in succession but with different teams, having been part of the Patriots' victory over the Atalanta Falcons a year ago. The attendance of 67,612 inside Minneapolis' US Bank Stadium took the combined total attendance at the 52 Super Bowls held so far past the four-million mark. London-born Jay Ajayi ran for 57 yards for the Eagles as he became a Super Bowl champion just four months after he was traded by the Miami Dolphins. This video can not be played Watch the moment the Eagles won the Super Bowl Another takeaway statistic from this game was the fact there were more passes thrown to the two quarterbacks than there were either sacks or punts. Foles' successful end-zone catch late in the second quarter was a moment of tactical brilliance from Eagles head coach Doug Pederson in his first Super Bowl, but was he inspired by the same play by opposite number Bill Belichick? Earlier in the second quarter, the Pats ran their own trick play when Danny Amendola turned quarterback and tossed the ball to a wide-open Brady, who just could not haul it in. It was only the third time in their long association that 40-year-old Brady and Belichick had attempted such a move. Brady caught the other two. As it was, the ball was soon back in the Eagles' possession and in the end zone, former Patriot Blount running in for a touchdown. This video can not be played Jeffery scores spectacular touchdown for Eagles ""This is like they are playing basketball. What happened to the excellent defences? What happened to the Philadelphia pressure? I don't know what is going on!"" BBC pundit Osi Umenyiora, a two-time Super Bowl winner, pretty much summed up the emotion that came with watching a game in which offense was king. The Eagles had been widely viewed as underdogs before the game, with New England seeking a third title in four years. Add in the fact most of the Eagles' players were appearing in their first Super Bowl - their entire 53-man roster had seven appearances in the showpiece between them, a number matched by Brady alone - and the gulf in their respective pedigrees became all too clear. Yet when the game kicked off, there was nothing to choose between them. The two sides traded early field goals from Jake Elliott and Stephen Gostkowski before the Eagles scored the first touchdown when Foles found Alshon Jeffery for a spectacular catch. Blount powered over to make it 15-3 after Brady's agonising fumble, but the Patriots reduced the deficit with a James White touchdown before Foles delivered his party trick, turning receiver just before half-time. The scoring continued at breakneck pace in the second half with Rob Gronkowski adding two touchdowns for the Patriots and Chris Hogan another, but the Eagles were matching them punch for punch as Foles found Corey Clement with a clinical pass before Ertz's score and another Elliott field goal preceded a grandstand finish. MVP and Eagles quarterback Nick Foles:""I felt calm all night. We are such a great group of guys. We felt confident. We just went out there and played football. We've been dreaming of this since we were little kids."" Patriots quarterback Tom Brady:""I expect to be back. I don't see why I wouldn't be back. It's tough to lose these games. You play to win and sometimes you lose. Disappointed. Wish we could have done a better job."" Eagles coach Doug Pederson:""I have got the best players in the world, I love this group. We have the best fans in the world and now the best team in the world. We wanted to stay aggressive. My mentality was stay aggressive and let Nick Foles make plays."" Patriots coach Bill Belichick:""Obviously we didn't do a good enough job coaching. We missed a lot of opportunities offensively in the first half, didn't play good enough defense, didn't play good enough in the kicking game. ""In the end, we just couldn't quite make enough plays, and that was all on me. Disappointing, but I'm proud of the way our team competed."" Eagles lineman Brandon Graham, who forced the match-winning sack:""We worked our butt off and we are world champs baby!"" This video can not be played Justin Timberlake's Prince tribute at Super Bowl The half-time show is always central to the Super Bowl razzmatazz, and once again it delivered as Justin Timberlake paid tribute to Prince by performing I Would Die 4 U during a busy 12-minute set in the late superstar's home town. Timberlake ran into the crowd to dance and pose for photos in an unfailingly energetic appearance, writes BBC Music reporter Mark Savage. Timberlake also tacitly acknowledged his last Super Bowl performance in 2004, which ended with Janet Jackson's infamous 'wardrobe malfunction'. On that occasion, he ripped a panel off Jackson's bodice, revealing her right breast as he sang the lyric ""gonna have you naked by the end of this song"". When he reached that line on Sunday, Timberlake stopped the music and cut to another song. Read more of Mark's analysis here. Timberlake's show (broadcast on a five-second delay instigated after the 2004 Super Bowl) was largely controversy-free ""Minneapolis, Minnesota, this one's for you,"" Timberlake declared, singing a new arrangement of I Would Die 4 U over an archive recording of Prince's vocals, as images of the late superstar were projected behind him Timberlake ended his show in the stands, singing Can't Stop The Feeling with a teenage fan.

"Two leading cabinet ministers have said that the UK will not remain in the single market or customs union during the transitional period planned for immediately after leaving the European Union. The UK government is now set to spell out its aims for new customs arrangements. But what is the difference between a free trade area, single market and a customs union? You can be in the EU's Single Market, but not the EU, this is what Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein do. The European Union's single market is perhaps the most ambitious type of trade co-operation. That's because as well as eliminating tariffs, quotas or taxes on trade, it also includes the free movement of goods, services, capital and people. That is why there has been no limit on the number of French people who can come to the UK, or the number of British people who can live in Spain - but there are limits on Turks or Ukrainians, for example. Also, a single market strives to remove so-called ""non-tariff barriers"" - different rules on packaging, safety and standards and many others are abolished and the same rules and regulations apply across the area. There are EU-wide regulations covering a whole host of industries and products on everything from food standards and the use of chemicals to working hours and health and safety. It is an attempt to create a level playing field and a single market; this does not happen in a free trade zone. A customs union means the Ireland/Northern Ireland border would remain open and easy to cross For goods, the single market was largely completed in 1992, but the market for services remains a work in progress a quarter of a century later. The EU has promised to introduce it many times, but several countries have dragged their feet and it is much more complicated than creating a single market for say, cars or computers. Even so, the City of London dominates financial services in the EU not least because it can do business in every member country. The EU is therefore not just a free trade area - it is a single market. But to stay in the single market, countries have to allow the free movement of goods, services, capital and people. That last one means immigration is difficult if not impossible to control - although the UK might get a special deal to allow some limits. Membership of the single market also normally involves making annual payments towards the EU's budget and accepting the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice, which would cross quite a few red lines for many Brexiteers. Turkey is part of a customs union with the EU but not in the single market. The deal does not cover food or agriculture, services or government procurement. The EU is not only a single market - it is also a customs union. The countries club together and agree to apply the same tariffs to goods from outside the union. Once goods have cleared customs in one country, they can be shipped to others in the union without further tariffs being imposed. If the UK left the Customs Union but stayed in the Single market, our exporters would  have to contend with what are called 'rules of origin'. These rules are designed to demonstrate that goods that legally originated in the UK - and did not contain more than the maximum permitted level of parts and components from elsewhere - qualify for duty-free entry into the EU. Fish factor That could be complicated for many companies that import components from around the world to put into finished products made in the UK. Some industries, such as fisheries, could be exempted from a free trade area depending on negotiations Also services are a huge part of the British economy, 78%, and are not totally covered by a customs union because they tend to face ""non tariff"" barriers. Still the UK could opt to leave the single market but stay in the customs union, but that does mean it couldn't negotiate free trade deals with other countries, the EU does that. It might also mean paying money to the EU and accepting ECJ judgements when they relate to trade and it is unlikely to cover farm produce or fish since the UK would not be in the Common Agricultural Policy or Common Fisheries Policy. A customs union does however have one big advantage, it means the Ireland/Northern Ireland border would remain open and easy to cross. If we left both the single market and the customs union we could negotiate a free  trade deal with the EU. A free trade area is one where there are no tariffs or taxes or quotas on goods and/or services from one country entering another. The negotiations to establish them can take years and there are normally exceptions. So agriculture and fisheries might be exempted, certain industries protected and some goods may not be covered. Services like banking and education also pose a problem in many free trade deals, as the barrier to trading services are not normally tariffs, but so called non-tariff barriers like different rules, standards and qualifications. So the negotiations can be very long and complicated and the result can still leave many barriers to trade. The UK is Ireland's biggest trading partner There is a free trade zone in Europe and we helped to create it: EFTA, the European Free Trade Association. It counts Norway, Iceland, Switzerland and Liechtenstein as members, but they now have a very close relationship with the EU; all but Switzerland are part of the single market. The EU also has free trade arrangements with many other countries around the world; so it is not against negotiating one with the UK in principle, but compared with staying in the single market or the customs union this would be the ""hardest"" form of Brexit. It would also almost certainly mean border controls including between Ireland and Northern Ireland.

"This video can not be played Amber Rudd says Jacob Rees-Mogg should not have accused Treasury of fiddling figures Home Secretary Amber Rudd has hit back at Tory Brexiteers over attacks on the civil service and claims of disunity. Ms Rudd said backbencher Jacob Rees-Mogg was ""wrong"" to accuse the Treasury of ""fiddling the figures"" with forecasts showing the UK would be worse off outside the EU. The leaked forecast that sparked the row was a cross-departmental ""tool"" to ""help inform the debate"", she said. And she said ministers were more united over Brexit than critics claim. Speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr show, she said she was ""not intimidated"" by Brexiteers' warnings over the customs union and that the UK government would not ""surrender too quickly"" in its battle for a ""bespoke"" trade deal with the EU. All you need to know about Brexit What the EU really wants from the UK The key Brexit dates in 2018 Negotiations are taking place between the UK and the EU ahead of the UK's scheduled exit in March 2019. Ahead of a week of key meetings, Theresa May is facing growing calls to set out in detail what she wants to secure - in particular how closely-bound the UK will be to the EU after it leaves. Writing inthe Sunday Telegraph,external,  Bernard Jenkin, a Conservative MP who was a key Leave campaigner, accused the government of being ""vague"" and ""divided"" on the issue. But Ms Rudd told Andrew Marr she had ""a surprise for the Brexiteers"", that the key Brexit committee of ministers was ""more united than they think"". The cabinet agrees on the need for ""frictionless trade"", the ability to strike international trade deals and avoid a hard border in Ireland, she said. And on the key point of the customs union - which currently prevents the UK from striking international trade deals - she suggested ""a form of customs agreement"" would be needed. Last week International Trade Secretary Liam Fox said it was ""very difficult"" to see how staying in a customs union would allow the UK to have an ""independent trade policy"" after Brexit. BBC political correspondent Susana Mendonca The accusations of cabinet divisions and disunity have kept coming from Brexit-supporting MPs over the past week. Now the home secretary has pushed back, saying the cabinet is ""more united than they think"". If that is the case, the cabinet will be expected to demonstrate some of that unity this week when discussions between Theresa May, David Davis and EU negotiator Michel Barnier are bound to throw up some bones of contention - the transition deal being the main one. Will the cabinet be singing from the same hymn sheet on that? And what about the customs union, another thorny issue that key ministers have very different views on? To silence its detractors, the cabinet will have to demonstrate this week it is neither ""vague"" nor ""divided"" - but whatever approach it comes up with is likely to lead to divisions with those who think they are going too far or not far enough. The role of the civil service has been thrust into the limelight in recent days by a leaked analysis predicting an economic hit to the UK after Brexit. Ms Rudd said the report did not ""model everything"" and predicted the UK economy would ""absolutely grow"" after Brexit, but said putting up trade barriers would have ""consequences"". Describing the civil service as the envy of the world, she added: ""We have to have these forecasts before making decisions."" She said she had been ""surprised"" at Mr Rees-Mogg's remarks and added that ministerial Brexit colleague Steve Baker - who has clashed with Whitehall unions and apologised to Parliament - had had an ""interesting week"". Mr Baker's apology followed a Commons exchange after which he was accused of not challenging Mr Rees-Mogg's suggestion of Treasury bias against Brexit. On the BBC's Sunday Politics, Conservative Party Chairman Brandon Lewis echoed Ms Rudd in saying Mr Rees-Mogg was wrong and defending Whitehall. Former top civil servants have also hit back at critics. Speaking on ITV's Peston on Sunday, ex-cabinet secretary Lord O'Donnell said claims officials were distorting figures were ""crazy"". People who do not like their analysis tend to shoot the ""messenger"", he said. ""We look at the evidence and we go where it is. ""Of course if you are selling snake oil, you don't like the idea of experts testing your products."" His predecessorAndrew Turnbull, who was cabinet secretary under Tony Blair, told the Observer,externalthat attacks on the civil service were similar to tactics used by German nationalists between the two world wars. BBC business reporter Rob Young Customs union members each apply the same tariff to goods bought from outside the EU. Goods from inside the EU are not subject to tariffs. Theresa May says Britain is leaving the customs union - so what will replace it? For a lot of firms, customs rules are just as important as a trade deal. Brexit could disrupt many supply chains, if businesses buy parts from Germany or Italy, for example. Many exporters want a new customs deal with the EU to reduce the need for border checks - limiting queues and paperwork. But this could restrict Britain's ability to strike international trade deals outside the EU. Some worry this undermines one of the key potential benefits of Brexit. Customs are also key to the future border with Ireland. No wonder this is one of the thorniest issues arising from Brexit. The UK and the EU do not currently agree on whether EU citizens moving to the UK during the planned two-year transition period after Brexit should get the same long-term rights as those who arrive before the UK leaves. Defending the UK's position, Ms Rudd said it was ""right to have a distinction between before March 2019 and afterwards"". Chancellor Philip Hammond has been the focus of much of the criticism from Brexiteers in the Conservative Party, and in his Telegraph article Mr Jenkin suggested Mr Hammond was not toeing the party line. ""If ministers are vague or divided, life for officials becomes impossible, as we can see now. Ministerial collective responsibility really matters,"" he said. He added: ""If the prime minister sticks to one policy and the chancellor keeps advocating another, what are officials meant to do?"" Earlier this month, Mr Hammond suggested the UK's relationship with the EUwould change only ""very modestly"" after Brexit. Mr Jenkin was a leading figure in the Vote Leave campaign But Mr Jenkin urged the prime ministerto stick to her positionand ensure, among other things, Britain leaves the single market and customs union. He wrote: ""She can only command a majority in Parliament on her present policy. ""Her MPs will back her, because we are overwhelmingly at one with the majority of the British people who now want a clean Brexit and an end to the present uncertainty.""

"David Davis and Theresa May will meet Michel Barnier this week Downing Street has insisted Britain will leave the EU customs union after Brexit amid claims of Tory disunity over the UK-EU future relationship. Theresa May has faced calls to spell out what she wants from the talks ahead of the UK's departure in March 2019. In a customs union the UK would have tariff-free trade within the EU, but would lose the ability to strike its own deals with other countries. It comes ahead of a meeting with the EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier. Explained: Customs union and single market Laura Kuenssberg: Customs union - the, a, or c? Amber Rudd hits back at Brexiteers What is the Brexit 'transition phase' all about? The prime minister and Brexit Secretary David Davis will meet Mr Barnier ahead of the next round of negotiations getting under way. Later, talks between officials will focus for the first time on the transitional period planned for after Brexit. Potential sticking points include citizens' rights, with the UK insisting EU nationals arriving during this time should not have the same rights as those who arrived before Brexit day. Mr Barnier, who is on his way to London, said he wanted to ""accelerate"" his schedule of meetings As he set off for London, Mr Barnier said there was ""not a moment to lose"" in order to secure a deal before the end of the year. Asked about the UK's position on the customs union, he said Downing Street's ""red lines"" would be respected but the UK must respect the ""rules of the union"". How close the UK will remain to the EU's single market and customs union has been a topic of debate among leading Brexiteers and some of those closest to the prime minister. Conservative MP Kwasi Kwarteng, who is an aide to Chancellor Philip Hammond, suggested the latest statement on the customs union was ""perfectly consistent"" with what No 10 had been saying all along, given that Mrs May had been ""pretty clear"" in her January 2017 Lancaster House speech the UK would be leaving. This video can not be played MP Kwasi Kwarteng tells Today a border in Northern Ireland doesn't have to be ""hard"" Pressed on how he squared this reality with Mr Hammond's stated desire for the UK and EU to move ""very modestly"" apart in terms of trade, he told BBC Radio 4's Today that ""being modestly apart does not mean you have to be in a customs union"". He said the government had to make it clearer its core aim was a free trade deal with the EU. On Sunday Eurosceptic Tory Bernard Jenkin accused the government of being ""vague"" and ""divided"", saying Chancellor Philip Hammond was not sticking to the approach put forward by the prime minister. Home Secretary Amber Rudd - who was a leading figure in the Remain campaign - played down the divisions in the cabinet, telling the BBC's Andrew Marr Show on Sunday: ""I have a surprise for the Brexiteers, which is the committee that meets in order to help make these decisions is more united than they think."" Future options? In a position paper published in August, the UK set out two potential options for future long-term customs operations. A ""partnership"" arrangement would see the UK ""align precisely"" with the EU in terms of imports and exports, removing the need for any customs checks between the two. The UK would continue to operate its own checks on goods coming from outside the EU - and safeguards would be needed to prevent goods entering the EU that had not complied with its rules. An alternative scenario would involve the UK extending customs checks to EU arrivals but under a ""highly streamlined arrangement"" to minimise disruption at ports and airports. This would seek to make the existing system of customs checks ""even more efficient"", for example using number plate recognition technology at ports, which could be linked to customs declarations for what the vehicles are carrying, meaning the vehicles do not have to be manually stopped and checked. UK proposes 'untested' customs system Ms Rudd said they agreed on the need for ""frictionless trade"", the ability to strike international trade deals and to avoid a hard border in Ireland, hitting back at those who question whether such a deal can be secured. ""We want to have a bespoke agreement,"" she said. ""Now we're not going to surrender before we have that battle."" She said Mrs May - who will chair a meeting of the 10-strong Brexit cabinet sub-committee on Wednesday and Thursday - had an ""open mind"" on how customs will be managed after Brexit. This video can not be played Amber Rudd says Jacob Rees-Mogg should not have accused Treasury of fiddling figures Quizzed on what the model might look like, she said she was ""not intimidated at all"" by critics' warnings about customs unions membership. Labour said it was ""foolhardy"" to rule out any kind of customs union with the UK's largest trading partner. ""The government must put jobs and the economy first, not their own internal party wrangling,"" a party spokesman said. Rudd hits back at Brexiteers What happens now that a deal's been done?

"Fancy some slideshows about Free Trade Agreements, non-regression clauses and something called EASA? Thought not. During January officials from the 27 remaining EU countries received a series of presentations from the European Commission about ideas for their future relationship with the UK. The slides reveal valuable clues about the EU's thinking ahead of the next phase of talks. I've read them all so that you don't have to. Pressure on May to choose over Brexit Calls to publish Brexit study rejected The key Brexit dates in 2018 To help the two sides manage an industry that catches 100 different types of fish worth Â£625m a year, the EU is mulling over a bespoke fisheries partnership with the UK. It would be based on current and existing fishing patterns. In other words, it might look very similar to the Common Fisheries Policy. The European Commission helpfully pointed out that the EU catches a lot of fish off the British coast and the UK sells a lot of fish to EU consumers, suggesting a link between access to each other's waters and each other's markets. Officials said that the UK could not remain a member of the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and the best it could hope for was a deal similar to those with the USA and Qatar, which would allow British airlines to fly into the EU but not between cities inside the EU. Britain's unconditional commitment to European security has been heard loud and clear. The EU is thinking about an agreement to share classified intelligence. The UK could be invited to join individual projects in the EU's new defence co-operation programme, called PESCO. There was a warning that the fall-back for failing to agree a replacement for the European Arrest Warrant would be a 1950s-era convention on extradition that's much less effective. The EU insists that the UK maintains the same data protection standards and guarantees the human rights of EU citizens when it comes to the fight against cross-border crime. ""Governance"" is the name the EU gives to a mechanism for dealing with future problems in the relationship and the punishments available if one side breaks the rules. The main message here is the more the final deal relies on EU law, then the greater the role for the European Court of Justice (ECJ). Brussels has suggested the ECJ settles disputes with the UK if a Joint Committee of British and European officials can't solve them first. That doesn't fly with the British, so European Commission officials also flagged up the EU's agreement with Ukraine. Ukrainian courts can ask the ECJ for advice, but its rulings could lead to the temporary suspension of sections of the deal with the EU, not changes to the law in Ukraine. This is going to be a huge part of the talks about the future relationship. Also known as the LPF, it is Brussels code for ways to stop the UK undercutting the EU on tax, labour and environmental standards. EU officials admit there are few legal ways they could prevent post-Brexit UK from slashing corporation tax to attract businesses, for example. Does the EU sign a tax co-operation deal like they have with Liechtenstein and Monaco? Do they insist on a written pledge to treat each other nicely? Or do they rely on the threat of the UK one day ending up on the EU's list of tax havens? And officials seemed particularly worried about State Aid - the British government using public money to help sectors of the economy with subsidies or investments. The European Commission says this must be dealt within the Brexit deal because existing international rules aren't enough to cope with a very big, very rich, very close neighbour like the UK. The slides show the EU looking confident in some areas, less so in others. Officials are wading through precedents, but are finding the UK is too big and too close to use off-the-shelf solutions for everything. And now a warning.

"The fire started in a resident's room at the Woodlands View care home One man has died and another resident is critically injured after a fire and explosion at a care home. Emergency crews were called to the blaze at Woodlands View care home in Stevenage, Hertfordshire, at 16:30 GMT on Saturday. Hertfordshire County Council said there had been a ""minor explosion"" caused by an oxygen cylinder. A resident in his 80s who was in the room where the fire started died in hospital. Another resident is in a critical condition and five others are being assessed in hospital. The home in Magpie Crescent is owned by HC-One. A spokesman said: ""Our deepest sympathies are with their family and we are doing everything we can to support them. ""Staff at the home took immediate action to notify the emergency services and evacuate residents, staff and visitors to safety in other parts of the home."" The company added that affected residents had been moved to other buildings at the site and to ""nearby sister homes"". Six ambulances and two air ambulances were sent to the care home A Hertfordshire County Council spokeswoman said: ""There appears to have been a minor explosion caused by an oxygen cylinder but a full investigation will need to be carried out to confirm this."" Hertfordshire's chief fire officer Darryl Keen said an investigation was under way and added: ""The fire was largely contained to the one room but there was a lot of smoke, which caused difficulties in some of the residents leaving the building."" Eight fire engines, six ambulances and two air ambulances were sent to the scene. The fire was under control by 18:00 and all residents were evacuated from the building. Eight fire engines and six ambulances were sent to the care home, which is run by HC-One The care home, acquired by HC-One in August 2017, is a complex of six separate buildings with about 25 residents in each unit. An inspection by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) in June, when the home was owned by Bupa, found it ""required improvement"" in all areas including safety. The CQC report,externalsaid: ""People's individual risks were assessed, however, this was not consistent and some needs were not risk assessed."" However, the reported added the buildings ""all had key-coded doors and fire exits were linked to the fire alarm so that they unlock in the event of the alarm sounding"".

"BBC website readers got in touch to ask questions about these sights There are some sights in cities across England that have left our readers puzzled. What is a statue of an American president doing here and why are some of our telephone boxes a different colour? Here are the answers to some of the questions our readers asked us to investigate. Matt Larbey, 30, said he asked the question after moving to the city and finding it ""a bit odd"" to see a statue of the 16th US president there. ""I heard a story that it was gifted because of something to do with the American Civil War... I'd love to know more about the story behind it,"" he said. The statue was donated by Mr and Mrs Charles Phelps Taft of Cincinnati, Ohio Mr Larbey had heard correctly - the statue honours Manchester's allegiance to Abraham Lincoln's Union during the American Civil War. The city boycotted cotton picked in the southern states in protest against slave labour,according to Visit Manchester.,external The resulting Lancashire Cotton Famine led to mass unemployment and poverty among textile workers in Manchester. They put their principles ahead of the need to feed their families and their actions assisted Lincoln in ending the Civil War. Lincoln wrote a letter praising the working people of Manchesterfor their ""sublime Christian heroism"". The statue, by George Grey Barnard, was originally sited in the grounds of Platt Hall, Platt Fields Park, in 1919. It was moved to Lincoln Square on Brazennose Street in 1986. Mr Larbey said: ""I always assumed that Manchester's history with the American Cotton industry and slavery would be more negative. ""One of the things I love about Manchester is how much civic pride everyone has."" England's oddest phrases explained The landmarks that mean you're nearly home England's steepest streets Hull's telephone network is run by independent provider KCOM Hull's telephone network was never run by the Post Office which was responsible for red phone boxes. In 1904, Hull City Council was one of several local authorities to set up their own phone network. Back then it was called Hull Telephone Department and today it isKCOM.,externalIt had cream phone boxes. Other authorities later gave up control of their networks to the Post Office which wanted to create a single national service. While the Post Office network was eventually taken over by BT, Hull's remained independent. All of the communications in the city were run by the city council until it sold its final stake in 2007 and soall of the phone boxes are cream,not the red that BT uses. Nanda Menon asked this question after noticing it when he moved to London from Malaysia in the 1960s. ""No one really seemed to know or were even aware that this particular quirk existed,"" he said. Cars drive on the right on the approach to the Savoy Hotel for a practical reason An act of parliament was passed in 1902 allowing carriages and cars to enter Savoy Court on the right. This was to prevent cars dropping off or picking up people at the Savoy Theatre from blocking the hotel's entrance. However, other benefits did emerge from the arrangement, a spokeswoman for the Savoy Hotel told us. Women traditionally sat behind their chauffeur, so pulling up on the right meant the rich and famous could exit their car in style. The driver did not need to walk around the vehicle to open the door so the guest could move straight from the car into the hotel.

"The Maya city of Tikal was found to be just a fraction of an immense hidden metropolis Researchers have found more than 60,000 hidden Maya ruins in Guatemala in a major archaeological breakthrough. Laser technology was used to survey digitally beneath the forest canopy, revealing houses, palaces, elevated highways, and defensive fortifications. The landscape, near already-known Maya cities, is thought to have been home to millions more people than other research had previously suggested. The researchers mapped over 810 square miles (2,100 sq km) in northern Peten. Archaeologists believe the cutting-edge technology will change the way the world will see the Maya civilisation. ""I think this is one of the greatest advances in over 150 years of Maya archaeology,"" said Stephen Houston, Professor of Archaeology and Anthropology at Brown University. Mr Houston told the BBC that after decades of work in the archaeological field, he found the magnitude of the recent survey ""breathtaking"". He added, ""I know it sounds hyperbolic but when I saw the [Lidar] imagery, it did bring tears to my eyes."" Most structures are believed to be stone platforms for pole-and-thatch homes Results from the research using Lidar technology, which is short for ""light detection and ranging"", suggest that Central America supported an advanced civilisation more akin to sophisticated cultures like ancient Greece or China. ""Everything is turned on its head,"" Ithaca College archaeologist Thomas Garrison told the BBC. He believes the scale and population density has been ""grossly underestimated and could in fact be three or four times greater than previously thought"". Described as ""magic"" by some archaeologists, Lidar unveils archaeological finds almost invisible to the naked eye, especially in the tropics. It is a sophisticated remote sensing technology that uses laser light to densely sample the surface of the earth Millions of laser pulses every four seconds are beamed at the ground from a plane or helicopter The wavelengths are measured as they bounce back, which is not unlike how bats use sonar to hunt The highly accurate measurements are then used to produce a detailed three-dimensional image of the ground surface topography The group of scholars who worked on this project used Lidar to digitally remove the dense tree canopy to create a 3D map of what is really under the surface of the now-uninhabited Guatemalan rainforest. ""Lidar is revolutionising archaeology,externalthe way the Hubble Space Telescope revolutionised astronomy,"" Francisco Estrada-Belli, a Tulane University archaeologist, told National Geographic. ""We'll need 100 years to go through all [the data] and really understand what we're seeing."" The Lidar images have surprised surveyors Archaeologists excavating a Maya site called El Zotz in northern Guatemala, painstakingly mapped the landscape for years. But the Lidar survey revealed kilometres of fortification wall that the team had never noticed before. ""Maybe, eventually, we would have gotten to this hilltop where this fortress is, but I was within about 150 feet of it in 2010 and didn't see anything,"" Mr Garrison told Live Science. While Lidar imagery has saved archaeologists years of on-the-ground searching, the BBC was told that it also presents a problem. ""The tricky thing about Lidar is that it gives us an image of 3,000 years of Mayan civilisation in the area, compressed,"" explained Mr Garrison, who is part of a consortium of archaeologists involved in the recent survey. ""It's a great problem to have though, because it gives us new challenges as we learn more about the Maya."" In recent years Lidar technology has also been used to reveal previously hidden cities near the iconic ancient temple of Angkor Wat in Cambodia. How lasers revealed a lost city in the Cambodian jungle 'Mayan day of apocalypse' marked Radio 4's In Our Time: The Maya Civilisation Maya civilisation, at its peak some 1,500 years ago, covered an area about twice the size of medieval England, with an estimated population of around five million. ""With this new data it's no longer unreasonable to think that there were 10 to 15 million people there,"" said Mr Estrada-Belli, ""including many living in low-lying, swampy areas that many of us had thought uninhabitable."" Most of the 60,000 newly identified structures are thought to be stone platforms that would have supported the average pole-and-thatch Maya home. The archaeologists were struck by the ""incredible defensive features"", which included walls, fortresses and moats. They showed that the Maya invested more resources into defending themselves than previously thought, Mr Garrison said. One of the hidden finds is a seven-storey pyramid so covered in vegetation that it practically melts into the jungle. Another discovery that surprised archaeologists was the complex network of causeways linking all the Maya cities in the area. The raised highways, allowing easy passage even during rainy seasons, were wide enough to suggest they were heavily trafficked and used for trade. ""The idea of seeing a continuous landscape, but understanding everything is connected across many square miles is amazing,"" said Mr Houston. ""We can expect many further surprises,"" he added. The Lidar survey was the first part of a three-year project led by a Guatemalan organisation that promotes cultural heritage preservation. It will eventually map more than 5,000 sq miles (14,000 sq km) of Guatemala's lowlands. The project's discoveries will feature in a Channel 4 programme called Lost Cities of the Maya: Revealed, airing in the UK on Sunday 11 February at 20:00 GMT.

"Many of the nation's favourite treats are getting smaller, but BBC research has found that some prices are falling too. Chocoholics and biscuit-lovers have been outraged in recent years by news of so-called ""shrinkflation"". That is when food manufacturers reduce the weight of their products without shrinking the price. So with the traditional January detox over, and many Britons reaching for a sweet snack, we have looked at whether the customer always loses out. We analysed 19 products over the last four years from high street chains Asda, Ocado/Waitrose, Sainsburys and Tesco. The figures reveal that 18 of the 19 products have been slimmed down. Five products hit by shrinkflation Jaffa quake as McVitie's cuts pack sizes More than 2,500 products subject to shrinkflation, says ONS Manufacturers often blame the rising cost of ingredients. Mondelez International, which makes Toblerone, said it had carried the costs for ""as long as possible"" before deciding to make their triangles further apart. Nestle said it had reduced weights sometimes to reduce calories or bring manufacturing in different countries into line. Others point to exchange rates, in other words how their buying power has been hit by falls in the value of the pound. But whether it is the ingredients, exchange rates, or saving us from obesity and bad teeth, all manufacturers insist that they give customers value for money. The price of a product is driven by all kinds of factors such as packaging, transport and marketing which might not change with alterations in weight. We have looked at price in two ways - price per 100g and actual price paid at the checkout per pack or bar. Four of our 19 products have got cheaper per 100g, while others have risen sharply. But many consumers will be concerned simply with the price they pay at the checkout per pack or bar. The data here shows more price drops but clearly these are not always in proportion to weight reductions. In total, nine of our 19 products had gone down in price per pack. Manufacturers know that keeping their products affordable is important. So while the ""shrink"" is overwhelming, the ""flation"" (raising prices by stealth) is happening... not quite so much. Produced by David Brown, Daniele Palumbo, Mark Bryson and Luke Keast. About the data:19 products were selected for which there was consistent price and weight data over a four year period from January 2014 to 25th January 2018. The data shown represent an average of the shelf price data provided by companies. Data supplied by Brand View.

"Bolton council has warned people against placing items in coffins as they can cause ""a hell of an explosion"" during cremation A coconut that was placed inside a coffin ""sent fear"" through staff at a crematorium when it exploded. Bolton Council has urged mourners to abide by crematorium rules and not ""slip"" items into coffins. Donna Ball, Assistant Director of Community Services, said a ""hell of an explosion can sometimes occur"". Other items of concern include mobile phones, TV remotes, e-cigarettes and bottles of alcohol. Sprawling Maya cities uncovered by lasers Airlines probed over seating policy Jack Whitehall regrets lewd Queen joke Ms Ball told the BBC: ""We are asking people to be considerate regarding the items they place into coffins before the cremation process. ""We have seen a rise in things like e-cigarettes, bottles of whisky and vodka, golf balls, sometimes golf clubs, and mobile phones. Mobile phones in particular are a real issue for us"". Love letters, cigarettes and extra underwear were amongst the banned items mourners requested to place with their loved ones Ms Ball said: ""Usually the funeral director will pick them up but sometimes things are slid inside peoples' pockets and they are just not picked up during the process, then when they go through the cremation process a hell of an explosion can sometimes occur"". She added that electrical items with batteries also push crematorium emissions up to ""unacceptable levels"". Louise Walch-Grognet, of Fred Hamer Funeral Services, said they check the coffins to make sure contraband items are not slipped in. ""They've asked can they put love letters in, cigarettes, ashes of their pets,"" she said. ""I've had a biker whose family wanted him to wear his leathers. Obviously we couldn't do that"". The funeral director said on one occasion she was even asked if an extra set of underwear could be placed with the deceased. Ms Walch-Grognet said it was her procedure to ""look under the lining of the coffin"" after the service due to mourners trying to sneak items in.
