"Five-time Wimbledon champion Venus Williams has not been charged over the fatal collision Footage has emerged showing that US tennis star Venus Williams was driving lawfully during a car crash that led to the death of a 78-year-old, police say. Surveillance video obtained by Palm Beach Gardens police in Florida shows Ms Williams' vehicle entering an intersection on a green traffic signal. An earlier police report had said Ms Williams was at fault and ""violated the right of way of [the other driver]"". Ms Williams' lawyer said the fatal crash on 9 June was an accident. The family of Jerome Barson, the man who died in the collision, have filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Ms Williams. New video evidence has revealed that the Grand Slam champion had the right of way as she entered the intersection of Northlake Boulevard in the city of Palm Beach Gardens, according to thepolice report,external. However as she proceeded, the report says, Ms Williams was forced to brake to avoid a collision with an oncoming vehicle, which delayed her from clearing the junction. Police released CCTV footage showing Ms Williams' vehicle (top left) colliding with another car As she then began to move forwards, a second vehicle - travelling in a different direction - entered the intersection on a green traffic signal, and the two cars collided. ""This updated information, based upon new evidence, is still under investigation,"" the police statement said. Watch: Venus Williams breaks down in news conference Mr Barson had been travelling with his wife who was driving their vehicle at the time. He was taken to hospital but died two weeks later from his injuries. Mrs Barson was also taken to hospital but survived. The initial police report, obtained by US media, said that no other factors such as drugs, alcohol or mobile phone distractions were being investigated. Ms Williams, the 37-year-old seven-time Grand Slam champion, reportedly told police she did not see the couple's car and she was driving slowly. She was not arrested in connection with the crash. On Monday, when questioned by reporters about the crash, Ms Williams broke down in tears, and said: ""There are no words to describe how devastating [it is]. I'm completely speechless."" Ms Williams' lawyer Malcolm Cunningham told CNN in a statement: ""Ms Williams entered the intersection on a green light. The police report estimates that Ms Williams was travelling at 5mph when Mrs Barson crashed into her. ""Authorities did not issue Ms Williams with any citations or traffic violations. This is an unfortunate accident and Venus expresses her deepest condolences to the family who lost a loved one."" Ms Williams is currently playing her 20th Wimbledon tournament in London, where she is seeded 10th. Ms Williams and her sister Serena have dominated the women's game for two decades.

"This video can not be played 'Inspirational' Bradley Lowery loses cancer battle Six-year-old Bradley Lowery, whose plight touched the lives of many people, has died after a long illness. The Sunderland fan was diagnosed with neuroblastoma - a rare type of cancer - when he was 18 months old. Bradley went on to be the club's mascot and became ""best mates"" with his hero, striker Jermain Defoe. A minute's applause for the youngster took place just before the kick-off in the club's friendly against Bury at Gigg Lane. Read more here about tributes and reaction to Bradley's death. Bury's chairman also said all gate receipts from the match will go to Bradley's fundraising campaign. Players from both teams, as well as the crowd at Gigg Lane, applauded the memory of the youngster His death was confirmed onsocial media by his parents,external. The posting read: ""My brave boy has went with the angels today. ""He was our little superhero and put the biggest fight up but he was needed else where. There are no words to describe how heart broken we are."" Bradley's mum Gemma Lowery had previously said his deterioration had been ""heartbreaking"" In a statement Sunderland FC extended its ""'love and support"" to Bradley's family. It said: ""He had a special relationship with Jermain Defoe and their feelings for each other were evident for all to see. Jermain, naturally, is heartbroken."" Bradley underwent treatment and was in remission, but relapsed last year. Well-wishers raised more than Â£700,000 in 2016 to pay for him to be given antibody treatment in New York, but medics then found his cancer had grown and his family was informed his illness was terminal. Bradley was a mascot for England when they played Lithuania in March In December, Bradley's parents Gemma and Carl, from Blackhall Colliery, County Durham, were told he only had ""months to live"". Four months later they were told the latest and final round of his treatment had failed. He underwent ""tumour-shrinking treatment"" at Newcastle's Royal Victoria Infirmary but the cancer continued to spread. On 24 May, Mrs Lowery said Bradley had left hospital to start palliative care at home, adding more tumours had been found and further radiotherapy was planned. Then, on 28 Junethe family wrote on Facebook:,external""Bradley is deteriorating fast, his temperature is going very high his breathing very fast his oxygen levels low. Bradley walked down the red carpet at the BBC's Sports Personality of the Year in 2016 ""He is sleeping most the time apart from odd times awake. We knew this was coming but we are heartbroken beyond words."" On 1 July, his familyposted a picture of Bradley with Defoewho, after signing for Bournemouth, returned to the North East to see him. On Thursday, Defoebroke down in tears during a press conferencefor his new club and said the six-year-old would ""always be in my heart"". Bradley with his dad Carl at the match between Everton and Sunderland Bradley became known worldwide following an appeal that saw him receive250,000 Christmas cardsfrom countries as far away as Australia and New Zealand. In December, he met England manager Gareth Southgate and Match of the Day pundit Gary Lineker at the BBC Sports Personality of the Year event in Birmingham. Bradley then won the programme'sDecember goal of the month awardafter he took a penalty ahead of Sunderland's game against Chelsea. Bradley became firm friends with his hero Jermain Defoe He has also appeared as amascot for Everton, who pledged Â£200,000 to his fundraising campaign, and was visited in hospital by a number of Sunderland players. A dream came true when he appeared asmascot for the England team at Wembley Stadiumbefore a game that saw Defoe score a goal. He was also givenhonorary 41st placein the race card for the Grand National at Aintree in April. On 30 June a charity single, ""Smile For Bradley"" by LIV'n'G, entered the singles chart at number 28. All proceeds from the song will go to the Bradley Lowery Foundation, which has been set up in his honour. Bradley got to try out the weighing scales at Aintree - coming in at 2st 12.5lb (18.37kg) Bradley was named Child of Courage at the Pride of North East Awards just days before a party was held to celebrate his sixth birthday, which was attended by Defoe and 250 other well-wishers. Fewer than 100 children in the UK are diagnosed each year with neuroblastoma and most living with the condition are under the age of five. It is a rare type of cancer that mostly affects babies and young children It develops from specialised nerve cells (neuroblasts) left behind from a baby's development in the womb It affects about 100 children each year in the UK The cause is unknown In very rare cases children in the same family can be affected, but generally neuroblastoma does not run in families Source:NHS Choices,external Dr Guy Blanchard, chair of Neuroblastoma UK, said: ""All in the neuroblastoma community will be saddened to hear the news of Bradley's death. ""His story raised significant awareness of a disease that is responsible for one in six of all children's cancer deaths. ""Through the world-leading research funded by Neuroblastoma UK, into improving both diagnosis and treatment of the disease, we will find a cure.""

"""Four minutes with him is worth hours of meeting with anybody else,"" one head of state said It's tough being a diplomat when nobody talks to you. It's even worse when they aren't talking to you because they don't think you matter anymore. When he was just a candidate, Donald Trump declared in his first major speech on the issue that ""our foreign policy is a complete and total disaster"". His solution was to replace it with a slogan: America First.  What he hasn't replaced, now that he is president, are the people normally tasked with projecting America's power around the world. ""It can't be business as usual when the entire [upper] floor of the State Department is missing,"" one ambassador said. Ambassadors in Washington are clueless these days, or rather clues are all they have, because, as this one was explaining to me, the usual avenues of diplomacy in the US capital have broken down. The same words were spoken by several ambassadors from across the globe that I've spoken to in DC recently. There are dozens of senior positions lying vacant at the Department of State The ""missing people"" are the undersecretaries and assistant secretaries of state with whom all the diplomats in the US capital normally conduct their day-to-day operational business. There are presently dozens of senior positions lying vacant. The people who are acting up in these roles, by their own admission, have no authority to take important decisions. Unfortunately for them, Washington, DC, is a city where your status is entirely defined by your ability to influence others. So the city's embassies, representing US allies in Asia, Europe and Latin America, have told their staff to largely bypass the state department and look for other avenues to get their voices heard. With a president widely viewed as being entirely un-ideological on all issues other than trade, face time is key. ""Four minutes with him is worth hours of meeting with anybody else,"" a visiting head of state told me recently. World leaders recognise transaction is the new diplomacy. America isn't taking one for the team anymore, because President Trump isn't a team player. So diplomats make sure they go into their meetings with an idea that Mr Trump can claim as a victory. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson can't be everywhere at once It must be structured, as one diplomat put it, ""so he can say to people, 'we scored a win here,' because for him it's all about winning"". To make their case more effectively, America's allies are cloaking their own agendas in the president's language and priorities. Trump and Putin meet face to face Merkelâs mission â co-opt Saudis and Russia to embarrass US Complex political issues are boiled down as ""fighting terrorism"". That's how the Saudi government played the president during his Middle East trip in May. The Saudis repackaged their long-simmering dispute with Qatar, over regional influence and the Muslim Brotherhood, as a battle against Islamist extremists. Latin American leaders are recasting their ""war on drugs'' as a ""war on terrorism"". President Trump's top team say little publicly On trade issues, countries make their pitch on the benefits to Mr Trump's support base and how much the people who voted for him will end up paying for stuff in the shops. Three minutes of Trump - decoded line by line How the media created President Trump A Western diplomat said his team had decided there were three groups of people President Trump listens to. There is his inner circle of White House advisers containing people like Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law; the former investment banker Gary Cohn; and Mr Trump's right-wing svengali Steve Bannon. The second group is his cabinet, and their influence varies widely from person to person, reflected in the time they each get with him inside the Oval Office. The third group is his pre-presidency contacts from New York, and the property and media industries. So foreign diplomats try to talk to as many people in this group of interlocking circles as they can, in the hope that if these people see the merit in their case, they will convey it to the president. And if the president hears that view enough times, he will believe it. Diplomacy in Washington has been reduced to a modern day version of Kremlinology However, after laying out this elaborate strategy, the Western diplomat confessed, ""but then there are those who say the most important thing is to be the last person to talk to him before he makes a decision"". Diplomacy in Washington has been reduced to a modern-day version of Kremlinology, where each individual policy outcome is used to measure the influence of the people arguing for or against it. From that is determined who is up and who is down and who is therefore important to influence. The guilty secret of every ambassador in DC is that the first thing they do in the morning is check the president's Twitter feed. That is now the best, perhaps it's the only, way to work out what is going on with US foreign policy. And while the White House press corps have derided Mr Trump's Twitter diplomacy, some of his allies have a grudging respect for it. ""An awful lot of politicians around the world are watching this and thinking, 'Can I learn from it?' because it's been astonishingly successful,"" one diplomat told me. ""This is a guy who had never run for public office anywhere and the first time he runs, he gets the biggest job on the planet. So he did something right.""

"A penis-shaped rock formation in Norway that was apparently knocked down by vandals last month has been restored to its anatomical glory. Scaffolding was used to hoist up the protuberance, which is reported to weigh about 12 tonnes (12,000kg.) The restoration operation was funded by a crowdfunding campaign which raised about 227,000 kroner ($27,000). But tourists will have to wait a week before they can see the formation in order to allow it to fasten properly. Cement, glue and metal fastenings were used to re-attach the Trollpikken, or ""The Troll's Penis"" to the cliff. Police last month said that indentations in the rock suggested vandalism was responsible for the demise of the stone. They say a suspect has been questioned over the incident. Indentations in the rock suggested the penis had been vandalised, police said Hikers found the stone, which originally came out from the rock face, resting on the ground. Days afterwards The Troll's Penis Will Be Re-Erected appeal was launched and had received money from close to 1,000 people. The rock formation is located in the municipality of Eigersund, in the south-west of the country.

"This video can not be played Why did it take so long to get an aerial platform to the tower block? BBC Newsnight investigates A series of failings that hampered the efforts of firefighters to tackle the Grenfell Tower fire and rescue the building's residents have been identified by a BBC investigation. Crews cited low water pressure, radio problems and equipment that was either lacking or did not arrive before the fire on 14 June got out of control. Newsnight has learned a high ladder did not arrive for more than 30 minutes. The London Fire Brigade says it has changed its procedures since the fire. A high ladder will now automatically be sent to a fire in a tower. An independent fire expert said having the high ladder, which is also known as an ""aerial"", available earlier would have given firefighters a better chance of stopping the blaze when it jumped from a fourth floor flat in the tower block and began to race up the side of the building. More than 200 firefighters and 40 fire engines were involved in battling the blaze that engulfed the block in North Kensington, west London. About 300 people are believed to have lived in Grenfell Tower and most got out on their own. The fire brigade rescued 65 people but at least 80 people are thought to have died. In depth: Grenfell Tower fire What happened at Grenfell Tower? Grenfell judge faces angry residents Grenfell Tower fire: Who were the victims? Law firm suspends staff over poster Firefighters have been told not to talk to the media but Newsnight obtained a copy of the ""incident mobilisation list"", the document which details every appliance dispatched to the incident. The programme was also sent anonymous accounts from a number of men and women involved in the operation. The mobilisation list revealed that the 30m (100ft) aerial, which could reach the 10th floor of Grenfell Tower, was not dispatched until 01:19 BST, 24 minutes after the first crews were sent to fight what had started as a fridge fire on the fourth floor. The aerial did not arrive until 01:32 BST, by which time the fire had raced up the building's cladding. The list entry A213 shows the ladder did not arrive until 32 minutes after the first crews Matt Wrack, general secretary of the Fire Brigades Union, said: ""I have spoken to aerial appliance operators in London... who attended that incident, who think that having that on the first attendance might have made a difference, because it allows you to operate a very powerful water tower from outside the building onto the building."" A London Fire Brigade (LFB) spokesman confirmed the so-called ""pre-determined attendance"" for a tower fire - the list of appliances which are automatically dispatched - has been changed from four engines to five engines plus an aerial. The spokesman said: ""An 'interim' change to pre-determined attendance for high rise buildings was introduced in direct response to the government's action to address concerns of cladding on buildings. ""The Brigade's pre-determined attendance to high rise buildings had already been increased in June 2015 from three fire engines to four as part of our ongoing review of high rise firefighting. ""It is important to understand that fires in high rise buildings are nearly always dealt with internally, not usually needing an aerial appliance. ""The fundamental issue of high rise safety remains that buildings are maintained to stop fires spreading."" The spokesman added: ""The Brigade has a fleet of specialist aerial firefighting appliances and these attend a variety of incidents across the capital."" Newsnight's investigation also heard that firefighters had struggled with water pressure problems and the fire service had to call Thames Water to ask the company to increase pressure in the area. One firefighter said: ""The fire floors we went in were helmet-meltingly hotâ¦ when we were clearing flats, it was a case of a quick look and closing doors because the water pressure wasn't up to firefighting."" A Thames Water spokesman said: ""We've been supporting the emergency services' response in every way possibleâ¦ any suggestion there was low pressure or that Thames Water did not supply enough water to fire services during this appalling tragedy is categorically false."" Firefighters also described problems with radio reception inside the building and said they lacked enough of the ""extended duration"" breathing apparatus they needed, especially when reaching the higher floors of the building. All fire engines have basic breathing apparatus that provides firefighters with oxygen for around 30 minutes. The extended duration apparatus enables them to breathe for a theoretical 45 minutes - but working in dense smoke and intense heat 20 storeys up uses up the compressed air in the equipment more quickly. The LFB said all of its rescue units carry extended duration apparatus and ""all of the fire brigade's rescue units attended the incident"". The LFB said the police investigation into the fire would examine the brigade's response ""including all of the issues Newsnight has raised"". Questions have also been raised about why a 42m firefighting platform had to be called in from Surrey to fight the fire at Grenfell - itself 67m high - because the LFB does not have one of its own. The LFB spokesman said it had never responded to a fire on the scale of Grenfell Tower before. He said: ""The commissioner has made clear her intention to fully review the brigade's resources and seek funding for any additional requirements.""

"Ed Sheeran has the number one album but some of his singles have fallen out of the chart The chart rules may have changed - but Justin Bieber is still number one. Last week, the Official Charts Company overhauled the way it compiles the Top 40 in an effort to stop A-list artists elbowing newer acts out of the way. The move was prompted by Ed Sheeran, whose new album Ã· [Divide] proved so popular that it propelled 16 tracks into the top 20 in March. Appropriately, he seems to be the main victim of the new rules, with several of his songs adversely affected. Last week, Sheeran had eight songs in the Top 100. This week, he has three. Four of those former hits dropped out naturally, because their sales declined following a brief, post-Glastonbury peak. But another song was excluded from the countdown because, under the new system, artists are only allowed a maximum of three songs on the chart at any one time. Some of Sheeran's other songs tumbled down the charts, apparently the victim of a second rule penalising tracks that are ""well past their peak and in steep, prolonged decline"". For those songs, the Official Charts Company is applying a new formula, whereby 300 streams count as one sale (for newer songs, the ratio is 150:1). The idea is that the longer a song has been in the charts, the faster it will fall out of the top 100. As a result, Sheeran's former number oneShape Of You,external, which has been in the Top 40 for 26 weeks, suddenly dropped 12 places after weeks of steady decline. Similarly Clean Bandit'sSymphony,external, which has been in the chart for 16 weeks, dropped 10 places. The upshot of these moves, however, is that newer tracks have been bumped into the Top 40; with more new entries this week than any other in 2017. Justin Bieber sings a verse on the Spanglish number one single Despacito These include Most Girls, the new single by actress Hailee Steinfeld, which makes its top 40 debut after hovering just outside the main countdown for six weeks. Finnish singer Alma also saw her singleChasing Highs,externalrocket from 54 to 30, giving the musician her first ever hit in the UK. Elsewhere, Selena Gomez'sBad Liar,externaljumped nine places to reach a new peak of 25. At the top end of the charts, the new rules made little difference. Luis Fonsi's Spanish-language smashDespacito,external, which features a guest verse from Justin Bieber, remained at number one for an eighth week. DJ Khaled and Rihanna'sWild Thoughts,external, meanwhile, held steady at number two. According to the Official Charts Company, the new rules were designed to ""ensure the chart continues to be a showcase for the new hits and talent which are the lifeblood of UK music"". But chart analysts questioned the need for the changes. ""It's a really odd situation,"" said Fraser McAlpine on the Top 40 podcastUnbreak My Chart,external. ""Part of the fun of the chart has always been that it reflects what people's listening habits are."" Prince scored six hit singles in the week after his death - but that would be forbidden under the new system ""If you've managed to iron out the possibility that everybody in Britain is suddenly really excited by four songs by the same artist, that seems like an odd way of hammering down on enthusiasm."" McAlpine noted that a situation like last April, when six Prince songs entered the Top 100 in the week after his death, would no longer be possible. ""The charts have never been a pure system,"" added his co-presenter Laura Snapes. ""But never before have the rules felt like such a blatant attempt to ensure the relevance of the singles chart at a time when it is less relevant than ever. ""It just seems like desperation and panic"". James Masterton, who has been commentating on the Top 40 for the last 25 years,was more positive on his blog,external, saying the new rules would  ""clear out"" long-in-the-tooth hits, such as Justin Timberlake's Can't Stop The Feeling which has spent 61 weeks in the Top 100, ""and which is now clearly taking up a space that could be better used by a newer hit"". On the album chart, where the system was unchanged, Sheeran remained at number one, closely followed by Calvin Harris's fourth album, Funk Wav Bounces Vol 1. Rag N Bone Man's Human rose two places to number three, which means it will spend its 21st week in the top five. The Bee Gees' greatest hits album Timeless jumped to number six, bolstered by Barry Gibb's recent appearance at Glastonbury. And TLC saw their final, self-titled album enter the chart at number 40 - an impressive placing given that fans who crowd-funded the project two years ago received their copies for free, making them ineligible for the chart.

Mrs Davies went to visit her sister and when her children returned to the family home their father tied them up.

"This video can not be played Trump to Putin: ""It's an honour to be with you"" Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin have discussed the alleged Russian hacking of last year's US presidential election during their first meeting. US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson described the exchanges as ""robust"". Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Mr Trump had accepted Mr Putin's assertions that his country was not responsible. But Mr Tillerson said it was not clear whether the two countries would ever come to an agreement on what happened. ""I think the president is rightly focused on how do we move forward from something that may be an intractable disagreement at this point,"" he added. The US and Russian presidents held their first face-to-face talks on the sidelines of the G20 summit in the German city of Hamburg, which is being held amid sometimes violent protests. Other topics discussed during their meeting - which lasted nearly two-and-a-quarter hours, longer than originally planned - included the war in Syria, terrorism and cybersecurity. Donald and Vladimir: How do they compare? Russia: The 'cloud' over the White House Who are the G20 protesters? In pictures: Violence at G20 protests ""The president opened the meeting with President Putin by raising the concerns of the American people regarding Russian interference in the 2016 election,"" Mr Tillerson, part of the US delegation, told reporters afterwards. ""They had a very robust and lengthy exchange on the subject. The president pressed President Putin on more than one occasion regarding Russian involvement. ""President Putin denied such involvement, as I think he has done in the past."" This video can not be played Russian interference? No-one knows - Trump Mr Tillerson said the two leaders had ""connected very quickly"", adding: ""There was a very clear positive chemistry between the two. There are so many issues on the table... Just about everything got touched upon... Neither one of them wanted to stop. ""I believe they even sent in the First Lady [Melania Trump] at one point to see if she could get us out of there, but that didn't work either... We did another hour. Clearly she failed!"" Mr Lavrov said: ""President Trump said he heard clear statements... that Russian authorities did not intervene [in the US election], and he accepted these declarations."" Mr Tillerson was asked as he was leaving the news conference if this was accurate, but declined to answer. This video can not be played Police fired water cannon as anti-G20 protesters lit fires Earlier, as the talks began in front of the media before going into private session, Mr Trump told Mr Putin: ""It's an honour to be with you."" Mr Putin replied: ""I'm delighted to meet you personally."" Mr Trump added: ""Putin and I have been discussing various things, and I think it's going very well. ""We've had some very, very good talks. We're going to have a talk now and obviously that will continue. We look forward to a lot of very positive things happening for Russia, for the United States and for everybody concerned."" Mr Putin, via a translator, said that while they had previously spoken by phone, that would never be as good as meeting face to face. The two men had staked out opposing views on major international issues in the run-up to the summit: On Thursday, Mr Trump used a speech in the Polish capital Warsawto call on Russia to stop ""destabilising"" Ukraineand other countries, and ""join the community of responsible nations"" Setting out his own G20 agenda in German financial newspaper Handelsblatt, Mr Putin called for US-led sanctions on his country, imposed in response to Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014, to be lifted Mr Putin also argued strongly in favour of the Paris climate agreement, saying it was a ""secure basis for long-term climate regulation"" and Russia wanted to make a ""comprehensive contribution to its implementation"" President Trump has taken the US out of the Paris agreement Based on the tone and the results of the US-Russia discussions, this meeting is being lauded here in Moscow as a breakthrough. The head of the Russian parliament's foreign affairs committee predicted it would ""stop the rot in US-Russian relations"". Essentially, Vladimir Putin has got what Vladimir Putin wanted: a US president who is focused not on confrontation but on mutually beneficial co-operation; as American leader who is not going to sit there for two hours lecturing his Russian counterpart on democracy, but instead do deals with him. And there were several agreements: to co-operate in Syria, over Ukraine, and in the area of cyber security. The Kremlin will see all of this as a first step towards a bigger goal: much wider co-operation with America and the scrapping of Western sanctions. But remember - Donald Trump is under intense pressure back home over his team's alleged links to Moscow. It's far from certain he'll be able to deliver what Russia wants. Climate change and trade are set to dominate the rest of the two-day G20 meeting, taking place amid clashes between protesters and police in the streets outside the venue that have left dozens injured. Cornering Trump on climate change G20 in pictures A huge police operation is trying to keep demonstrators - who are protesting against the presence of Mr Trump and Mr Putin, climate change and global wealth inequalities - well away from the summit venue, and water cannon have been deployed. The US First Lady was at one point unable to leave her hotel in Hamburg because of the protests. Mrs Trump had been due to take part in an excursion with other leaders' spouses, but her spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham said: ""The Hamburg police could not give us clearance to leave.""

"A three-month-old chihuahua abandoned in a Las Vegas airport toilet has been taken in by a local animal rescue. Chewy's owner left the puppy at McCarran International Airport on 2 July with a letter explaining she was leaving an abusive partner and could not take the dog on the plane with her. ""Hi I'm Chewy,"" explained the note. ""My owner was in an abusive relationship and couldn't afford me to get on the flight. She didn't want to leave me with all her heart but she has no other option."" The letter goes on to explain how her partner also hurt Chewy: ""My ex-boyfriend kicked my dog when we were fighting and he has a big knot on his head. He probably needs a vet. I love Chewy so much. Please love and take care of him."" Chewy was left in a bag in the women's toilet. The lady who found the bag worried it was a suspicious item and contacted security. The canine unit was deployed to inspect the bag but the dogs knew straight away there was a puppy in there. An officer opened up the bag and found Chewy. An employee at the airport brought Chewy to theConnor and Millie's Dog Rescue,external, a local shelter where he is now being looked after. ""We took him to the emergency vet and got him checked out immediately"", Darlene Blair, of Connor & Millie's Dog Rescue, told the BBC. ""He did have a bump on his head but in 24 hours it was gone. He is fine and healthy and is being well taken care of."" Chewy is now happy and safe at a local dogs shelter Darlene said the shelter had not been contacted by Chewy's owner. ""We've had a lot of messages demanding we try to find her. The airport has been bombarded by people saying they need to find this woman. ""Chewy is going to be fine and this poor woman is out there somewhere and we don't want to draw her out. We are hoping with all our hearts that she has seen this and knows Chewy is safe and we hope she is safe. ""I wish this story would bring more attention to the fact it's a felony to abuse an animal but it's not a felony to abuse a woman."" 'Tell them Chewy sent ya' Also speaking toNews 3 Las Vegas,external, Darlene said the incident really got to her. ""You could tell by the way the note was written that the woman was in dire stress and she didn't want to give him up and she couldn't take him with her."" The shelter has since been inundated with offers of a home for Chewy. ""Chewy is safe, healthy and thriving. We have received thousands of applications and inquiries about adopting Chewy and we sincerely appreciate each and every one,"" the shelter posted on Facebook. ""We are hoping that Chewy's mom is in a safe place and will see Chewy's story so we can return Chewy to her if she so chooses and the circumstances are right for both of them. ""Chewy is still receiving some medical attention and is not ready for adoption yet. "" Although it has gained 1,670 online friends in the past week, the shelter is no longer accepting adoption applications for Chewy.

"The rally in Manchester city centre drew thousands of demonstrators A primary school dinner lady who attended a march co-organised by former English Defence League (EDL) leader Tommy Robinson has been suspended. Rachel Booth was at the rally on 11 June in Manchester, which organisers said was ""against Islamic hate"". She said she attended in sympathy for the victims of the Manchester attack that killed 22 people on 22 May. Moor Nook Primary School, in Preston, confirmed a member of staff has been suspended ""pending further inquiries"". Rachel Booth has worked at Moor Nook Primary School, in Preston for four years Thousands of people attended the marchby a coalition that calls itself UK Against Hate, held three weeks after a suicide bombing at an Ariana Grande concert. The rally also drew hundreds of people in a counter-demonstration against the march. Mrs Booth, who has worked at the school for four years, said the suspension was ""a big shock"". ""I have never been in any kind of trouble with police. ""The grounds for suspending me are it was an EDL march, which is a load of rubbish. Even if I was part of the EDL, which I'm certainly not, it should not have affected my job."" She said she attended with her mixed race husband, who is a former serviceman, to show solidarity with the bombing victims, not to support far-right extremism. ""I thought it was for the children and so I went,"" she added. Hundreds of counter-demonstrators also attended the rally The march was criticised at the time by Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham who tweeted: ""These EDL-types who came today need to have a look at themselves."" In a letter to the school, Mohammed Fyaz, one of the march's organisers, wrote ""the event in question was not organised by or linked to the EDL in any way"". He added: ""In the democracy in which we live political, religious and moral issues should be allowed to be discussed, questioned and at times challenged freely, without fear of persecution or discrimination."" It is understood a suspension in such circumstances is a ""neutral"" act and will allow the school to investigate footage from the march featuring Mrs Booth.

"Two criminals who were being deported to Jamaica from the UK tried to thwart the process by putting razor blades in their mouths, a report has revealed. The incident took place ahead of a charter flight carrying 32 detainees from Stansted Airport in March. Prison inspectors say the ""immediate reactions"" of the private contractors escorting the men led to a ""risky situation, although it ended calmly"". But they said a staff briefing had not provided guidance on welfare issues. The flight was chartered by the Home Office, with private company Tascor responsible for the guards escorting detainees from a number of immigration centres. BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw said it was very rare for details of deportation flights to be made public. The report provides an important glimpse into the process and shows how difficult and dangerous it can be, he added. The detainees were guarded on the plane by 103 staff and three healthcare workers. HM Inspectorate of Prisons said during a briefing held before the night-time removal operation, staff had been told that ""virtually all"" the detainees were ""violent criminals who have assaulted staff"". ""There was a strong emphasis on the risk of disruptive behaviour,"" said its report. But it added ""talking up risks undermined to some degree even experienced staff's confidence in their interpersonal and other skills"". The two men were found to have fragments of a razor blade in their mouth at Brook House immigration centre in West Sussex. ""One of the staff swore loudly, exclaiming he had blades in his mouth, while another grabbed his arm and several staff told him to spit the blades out, which he ignored,"" says the report. He eventually handed over the blade fragments on the aircraft after he had been placed in a ""waist restraint belt"". The other man had been on self-harm monitoring and walked with a crutch and staff were said to have ""treated him with reasonable consideration for his disability"". The report described the response to the two men as ""proportionate"". It said the reasoning behind the treatment of a 57-year-old woman who was made to wear a rigid handcuff and then fitted with a waist restraint belt after refusing to board the aircraft ""was much less clear"".

We look forward to a lot of very positive things happening for Russia, for the United States and for everybody concerned."" Mr Putin, via a translator, said that while they had spoken by phone, a phone conversation was never as good as meeting face to face. Both men ignored shouted questions from reporters as the meeting went into private session. This video can not be played Police and anti-summit protesters clashed for a second day Speaking afterwards, Mr Putin said: ""I've had a very long conversation with the US president. We had a lot of issues to discuss, including Ukraine, Syria, and other problems, also some bilateral issues. ""We have again returned to the fight against terror and to cyber security."" Secretary of State Rex Tillerson largely confirmed these were the topics covered, saying the leaders connected quickly and had positive chemistry. But the two sides seem unable to agree on the exact outcome of talks over the Russian hacking allegations. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Mr Trump accepted Mr Putin's assertions that they were not true. Mr Tillerson, meanwhile, said the two men had had a ""robust"" discussion on the issue during the two hour and 15 minute meeting, and that Mr Trump had pressed the Russian leader on several occasions. However, he said it was not clear whether the two countries would ever come to an agreement on what happened. ""I think the president is rightly focused on how do we move forward from something that may be an intractable disagreement at this point,"" Mr Tillerson said, according to theAssociated Press news agency,external. Mr Tillerson also said they had discussed Syria and its future, and shared ""commonalities on what outcome should be"", although they had different ideas on how to get there. They have, however, agreed to declare a ceasefire in south-west Syria from Sunday, Mr Lavrov said. Earlier, a brief videoclip posted on the German government's Facebook page,externalshowed Mr Trump and Mr Putin meeting for the first time and shaking hands, with Mr Trump patting Mr Putin's arm as they smiled in the company of other leaders. The words were warm enough, but the body language was restrained as this meeting began. Neither man was smiling much as both said they hoped for positive results from their encounter. Their handshake, when it finally came, was brief and businesslike. But they clearly had plenty to talk about, as their meeting went on well over the time allocated. Russia sees that alone as a success, proof that Vladimir Putin is a global leader to be reckoned with. No-one here is expecting any big deals though, like lifting sanctions for example. The Kremlin has stressed all along that its main aim is to establish a ""working dialogue"" with Donald Trump, and perhaps begin the slow process of restoring relations with the US, which are at their lowest point in many years. The two men staked out opposing views on major international issues in the run-up to the summit: On Thursday, Mr Trump used a speech in the Polish capital Warsawto call on Russia to stop ""destabilising"" Ukraineand other countries, and ""join the community of responsible nations"" Setting out his own G20 agenda in German financial newspaper Handelsblatt, Mr Putin called for US-led sanctions on his country, imposed in response to Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014, to be lifted Mr Putin also argued strongly in favour of the Paris climate agreement, saying it was a ""secure basis for long-term climate regulation"" and Russia wanted to make a ""comprehensive contribution to its implementation"" President Trump has taken the US out of the Paris agreement This video can not be played Mr Trump was once popular in Russia, but opinion there has turned against him since he came into office The G20 (Group of Twenty) is a summit for 19 countries, both developed and developing, plus the EU. In her summit opening statement, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said: ""We are all aware of the great global challenges. ""We know that time is short and therefore solutions very often can only be found if we are ready to compromise and work together without bending over backwards too much because, of course, we can express different views on some issues.""

Mrs Merkel has said the G20 willfocus on the Paris climate dealbut, as the G20 host, she will work to find compromises. Mrs Merkel and other EU leaders have also expressed their commitment to an open international trading system, while the Trump administration pursues protectionism under the ""America First"" motto.

"Charlie Gard has been in intensive care since October Great Ormond Street Hospital has applied for a fresh hearing in the case of Charlie Gard following claims of ""new evidence relating to potential treatment for his condition"". It comes after seven medical experts suggested unpublished data showed therapy could improve the 11-month-old's brain condition. Previously, the High Court said it was unlikely a US doctor offering to treat Charlie would be able to cure him. GOSH said it would ""explore"" the data. Charlie's case will be heard by Mr Justice Francis on Monday at 14:00 BST, according to a High Court listing. Under a High Court ruling, GOSH is forbidden from allowing Charlie to be transferred for nucleoside therapy anywhere A hospital spokesman said: ""Two international hospitals and their researchers have communicated to us as late as the last 24 hours that they have fresh evidence about their proposed experimental treatment. ""We believe, in common with Charlie's parents, it is right to explore this evidence. ""Great Ormond Street Hospital is giving the High Court the opportunity to objectively assess the claims of fresh evidence. ""It will be for the High Court to make its judgment on the facts. ""Our view has not changed. We believe it is right to seek the High Court's view in light of the claimed new evidence. ""Our priority has always been, and will always be, the best interests of Charlie Gard."" Under a High Court ruling, GOSH is forbidden from allowing Charlie to be transferred for nucleoside therapy anywhere. Seven clinicians and researchers, including the US doctor, signed a letter explaining that the treatment would be experimental for Charlie's particular condition. They claim that ""ideally"" the treatment would first be tested on mice but state that, in Charlie's case, there is not time for such a trial. Charlie has mitochondrial depletion syndrome, a rare genetic condition which affects the part of the cell responsible for energy production and respiration and has left him unable to move or breathe without a ventilator. Connie Yates and Chris Gard raised more than Â£1.3m for experimental treatment for Charlie Doctors at GOSH have said he cannot see, hear, move, cry or swallow and that his life support should be switched off because there is no chance of his condition improving. Charlie's parents,Connie Yates and Chris Gard, raised Â£1.3m on a crowdfunding site to pay for experimental nucleoside therapy in the US. But they lost a legal battlewith the hospital last month when judges at the European Court of Human Rights ruled further treatment would""continue to cause Charlie significant harm"". Signatories to the new letter include a neurologist and a research fellow from Rome Children's Hospital, a scientist from Cambridge University's Mitochondrial Biology Unit and two researchers from Vall d'Hebron Institut de Recerca in Barcelona.

"Nearly a month after the Grenfell Tower disaster, only a handful of affected households have been re-housed. Why is there such a delay in accommodating the survivors? Antonio and Christopher Roncolato (pictured above) are fairly typical of the survivors - they say they want a ""decent"" home, with secure tenancy, close to their jobs in Kensington. But this seemingly straightforward request is proving complicated to achieve. Although 68 flats will be available later this summer in a brand-new block in Kensington - the affordable housing portion of a luxury development - 158 families have been assessed for new housing by the response team. So far, just 14 households have taken up offers of accommodation. Others are living in hotels or with friends and family. Kensington and Chelsea has nearly 7,000 units of social housing, but 67% of these homes are small - studios or one-bedroom flats. Grenfell families are - understandably - turning down homes in older tower blocks. The borough has not said what proportion of these flats is in towers. Social housing turnover in Kensington and Chelsea is very low Social housing turnover in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea is also very low. Last year an average of eight homes (including those owned by housing associations) were socially rented every week across the borough. So if the families were to wait for suitable properties to become available, it could take a very long time indeed. While private landlords may want to help the families, they cannot offer the secure tenancies that the families want, according to David Smith, property lawyer and policy director for the Residential Landlords Association. He says mortgage companies place restrictions on landlords, so that they can't offer leases longer than a year or two. Some freeholders impose similar restrictions. There's very little available land in this part of London. In the shadow of Grenfell tower is a brand new estate developed by the council and Peabody Housing Association. It's cleverly designed, and has just won a major award. It's wrapped around a 1970s tower block, and it took more than two years to build, once planning had been granted and terms agreed. A new estate stands in the shadow of Grenfell Tower There are plenty of flats for sale in North Kensington, but local estate agents say a two-bedroom home would cost at least Â£600,000 - so buying individual properties could cost more than Â£50m. The think tank Centre for London suggests the council put up modular housing instead. These are high quality - but can be constructed in months, not years. There's no obvious site for them in the borough, but they could be placed on one of the big development sites west of Kensington. It would keep the community together, and could last for at least three to five years - while a permanent solution is found. The London borough of Lewisham has experimented with modular housing to tackle a shortage. The Place/Ladywell Project, designed by the architects Rogers Stirk Harbour & Partners, was opened late last year.

"Luciana Berger was re-elected with an increased majority The new Labour Party chairman Ian Lavery hastold the Daily Mirror,externalthat he doesn't see the ""de-selection"" of MPs critical of Jeremy Corbyn ""as the way forward"". Chills had gone up some Blairite spines when Mr Lavery himself had suggested at the weekend the Labour ""might be too broad a church"". But he sought to calm nerves which had been further put on edge by comments from Mr Corbyn's close ally Chris Williamson, recently re-elected as the MP for Derby North having been narrowly defeated at the 2015 election. On Thursday, Mr Williamson said: ""There are individual MPs in this party who think it's their God-given right to rule. ""No MP should be guaranteed a job for life. Labour is a big church, but we currently have a large bulk of MPs who represent one relatively small tendency in the congregation... it's unreasonable to think we as MPs can avoid any contest."" His words didn't sound like empty rhetoric to the MP for Liverpool Wavertree, Luciana Berger - seen as being on the moderate wing of the party. She had resigned as a shadow minister when, a year ago, 80% of Jeremy Corbyn's MPs were expressing no confidence in his leadership. Jeremy Corbyn has stressed his support for party democracy A left-wing ""slate"" of candidates had succeeded in taking almost all of the key offices on her local party's executive. And one of the winners - Roy Bentham - hadshared his thoughts with the Liverpool Echo,external. He suggested that Ms Berger, who was re-elected last month with an increased majority, publicly recant her criticism of the party leader and for the avoidance of doubt he declared: ""She is answerable to us now."" The local party secretary Angela Kehoe-Jones distanced herself from the remarks and suggested the branch was ""united"" in fighting the Tories. But there is little doubt that Ms Berger - who is on maternity leave - feels her job is under threat. And she is not the only one. A Labour MP who held her seat against the odds at the election told me she was threatened with de-selection within 48 hours of the result. And you only have to visit websites which purport to back the Labour leadership to view a ""rogues' gallery"" of MPs who are seen as disloyal. Chuka Ummuna faced criticism over amendment to Queen's Speech Featuring on most lists is Chuka Umunna, who upset those close to Mr Corbyn by pushing an amendment to the Queen's Speech to keep Britain in the EU single market - not official party policy. This was seen asforcing the party leader in to sacking frontbenchersand was the first tangible sign of disunity following the euphoria of the election result. And while he wouldn't want to see Mr Umunna unseated, even Labour's deputy leader Tom Watson regarded that amendment as bad politics. But some left-wing activists don't need new offences to be taken in to account. Some see those MPs who distanced themselves from Jeremy Corbyn as saboteurs of Labour's success. And they are building a narrative that had they been more loyal - and party officials more ambitious - they could have propelled the party from second to first place at the election. But don't expect a mass purge of Labour MPs. Indeed, some Corbyn critics are likely to be offered junior spokespeople roles in the autumn. But not all of those who are seen as beyond the pale are likely to be unseated. Mr Corbyn has time and again stressed how much he supports party democracy. So unless a local party has been - as in Luciana Berger's case - taken over by members and supporters of Momentum (the group set up to keep the spirit of Mr Corbyn's leadership campaigns alive) it would be difficult to dislodge the sitting MP. And it should be said, not all local Momentum groups favour de-selecting sitting MPs in any case. They would point out that they have campaigned for the re-election of MPs who aren't ideological fellow travellers. Ian Lavery has spoken out against de-selection Momentum nationally weren't chuffed with a Facebook post from the South Tyneside group suggesting MPs such as Chris Leslie and Jess Phillips should ""join the Liberals"". Instead of pushing existing personalities out, largely beneath the political radar there are attempts to move Labour more solidly and permanently to the left and to ensure that, when the time comes, Jeremy Corbyn would be able to hand over the leadership to someone who largely shares his political outlook. So at this year's Labour Party conference, there will be a move to shift the power in future leadership elections from MPs to party members. This would mean just 5% of MPs - not the 15% of MPs and MEPs at present - would be needed to put a candidate on the ballot. With a snap election, most anti-Corbyn MPs were returned to Parliament so while a left-wing candidate still might struggle to get 15% support, 5% is considered no barrier. This move has already been reported extensively. Mr Corbyn's internal opponents call it ""the McDonnell amendment""  - as shadow chancellor John McDonnell is a red rag to any of the party's more moderate bulls. Groups of what were called Blairites and Brownites - they would call themselves modernisers or moderates -  in organisations such as Progress and Labour First have been working hard to secure enough delegates to the annual conference to defeat the leadership changes. With the deadline for deciding delegates drawing to a close, it's not clear yet who has the upper hand. But something of a quiet revolution could be under way that would see the power of Jeremy Corbyn, and his supporters, entrenched. Under Labour's rules, some topics need to be put on the table this year if they are decided next year. So a slow burning fuse will be lit in the autumn that could blow up in to a more major row in 2018. There are moves by those on the party's left to make it easier for local parties to oust sitting MPs in future. This would involve party branches being encouraged to put forward alternative names for consideration, or for sitting MPs to be required to demonstrate they had 66% support locally  to continue. There will also be a move to increase the number members of Labour's ruling National Executive Committee (NEC), who are elected not by MPs or the unions, but by the rank-and-file members. The assumption is that they are more in tune with Mr Corbyn's agenda. Iain McNicol (second right) sings The Red Flag at the 2015 Labour conference The NEC approves party candidates for elections - and a panel of its members chooses by-election candidates. There was an attempt to disbar the pro-nuclear and anti-Corbyn candidate John Woodcock at an NEC meeting just before the election. That failed, but if the balance of power on the body were to change, so could the career prospects of the leadership's critics. And indeed the career prospects of Labour's general secretary Iain McNicol would be called in to question by another proposed change. There will be an attempt to give members the right to choose the party's top official in future. Again, this can't be decided until next year but could put Mr McNicol on notice. He is blamed for trying to deny new (and, it was assumed, more radical) members the right to vote in last year's leadership contest and for not putting enough resources in to Labour/Tory marginals at the general election. He would contend that the party HQ's strategy of defending vulnerable seats - as well as swiftly moving resources to seats which looked promising as the campaign progressed - was a success. So by its actions in the coming months, Labour -8 points ahead in one opinion poll today,external- could choose to remain a broad church. Or further expose the fact that many of its MPs and grassroots members aren't really singing from the same hymn sheet.

"This video can not be played Will Shu, Deliveroo's boss, says the law needs to change to catch up with the modern economy The food delivery firm Deliveroo has said it will pay sickness and injury benefits to its 15,000 riders in the UK if the law is changed. In a submission to the government's review of the ""on-demand"" economy seen by the BBC, the firm says that at present the law prevents it from offering enhanced rights because it classifies its riders as self-employed. Deliveroo says it uses that classification to provide its riders with the flexibility to work when they want. It says employment rules should be changed so that people who work for companies like Deliveroo and Uber can receive enhanced benefits and not lose that flexibility. Sources say that the firm is willing to look at enhanced payments to riders to cover things like sickness pay - and that the money would probably be administered under a government controlled scheme similar to national insurance or pensions contributions. It may mean that Deliveroo riders and others working for similar on-demand firms like Uber are ""reclassified"" as gig workers. The move comes after a slew of criticism and court cases against gig economy companies over how they treat people who work for them. ""Central to our popularity with riders and our success as a business is the flexible nature of the work that we offer,"" the submission says. ""We want to offer riders more security. ""We believe everyone - regardless of their type of contract - is entitled to certain benefits, but we are constrained in offering these at the moment."" 'Gig economy' workers 'should get minimum wage' 'Pay self-employed minimum wage' At the moment ""self-employed"" workers in the gig economy do not have the right to sickness pay, holiday pay or maternity and paternity leave. They also are not covered by the minimum wage rules. That has led to criticism that the people who ride or drive for gig companies are actually ""workers"" and should receive a wide range of benefits. There are also concerns that companies are exploiting loopholes in employment law and lack of enforcement to run their businesses profitably. Deliveroo says that if it did offer ""worker"" contracts, flexibility, which is very popular with its riders, would be lost. Deliveroo riders, for example, are allowed to work for other on-demand economy businesses at the same time. This makes it impossible, the firm argues, to guarantee the minimum wage which is based on working for a single employer. Deliveroo says its riders earn on average Â£9.50 an hour, Â£2 more than the National Living Wage. The firm says it is wrong that riders are at present involved in a ""trade-off"" between flexibility in the way they work, and the security of full employment benefits. Company sources have told me that, following moves on sickness pay, Deliveroo would be willing to look at holiday pay, pension rights and maternity and paternity entitlements. Those rights could be ""earned"" by riders after a certain number of deliveries have been achieved. ""At present, companies in the UK are forced to class the people they work with as either 'employees', 'workers' or 'self-employed',"" the submission says. ""Our riders are 'self-employed'. This gives them full flexibility - but the quid pro quo is that they are not entitled to certain benefits. ""In short, there is currently a trade-off between flexibility and security and we want to play our part in overcoming this divide."" Deliveroo is one of a new breed of ""on-demand"" firms which operate in what is known as the gig economy. Riders for the firm - 60% of whom are under the age of 25 - log on to the company's digital platform and receive ""jobs"" delivering food, on a bike or a scooter. Matthew Taylor, the head of the Royal Society of Arts, was asked by the government to review this new world of work, including the gig economy and zero hours contracts. He is expected to publish his report imminently on how to reform employment law so that workers can be flexible without being exploited. Deliveroo's announcement today has received pretty short shrift from the TUC. Here's general secretary Frances O'Grady on my story this morning: ""This reads like special pleading. There's nothing stopping Deliveroo from paying their workforce the minimum wage and guaranteeing them basic rights like holiday and sick pay. ""Plenty of employers are able to provide genuine flexibility and security for their workforce. Deliveroo have no excuse for not following suit. ""The company's reluctance to offer benefits now is because they want to dodge wider employment and tax obligations by labelling staff as self-employed."" Here's another update. The boss of Deliveroo, Will Shu, has told me that the company is willing to go further than offering its riders sick pay and injury insurance. I put it to him that the benefits debate in the gig economy went far further than sickness benefits and injury insurance, and asked whether the company would look at issues like pension payments and holiday entitlements. ""This is the beginning of the debate,"" Mr Shu told me. ""We sat down with - me personally - hundreds of riders and asked, what do you care most about today? ""It was sick pay and insurance for injury and that is what we are starting with. But we are open minded to different things."" That sounds like a yes, the company is willing to look at further benefit areas. It will be interesting to see how Matthew Taylor's report, expected next week, deals with the issue of broader rights for gig workers. I asked Mr Shu for his response to critics who say that the only way firms like his make money is by not paying national insurance payments for their riders, pension contributions and other benefits. ""Not at all,"" he answered. ""I understand [the criticism] - it is a new way of doing businesses. ""The on-demand economy in Britain is five or six years old and there are hundreds of thousands of people in it so the growth has been huge, and so it is understandable that people haven't understood the intricacies. ""At the end of the day though, let's take it back, it is a very different relationship than regular employment. People can come and go as they please. ""The issue is this - if we offer benefits to people the courts may reclassify self-employed people as workers thus robbing them of the flexibility they ultimately signed up for, for the job. ""What that practically means is that you would work on a shift pattern, you wouldn't log in and out as you please. It is a very different work relationship."" And would mean that Deliveroo wouldn't be, well, Deliveroo. Deliveroo boss on workers' rights.

The Crown Prosecution Service has its headquarters by the Thames That was before the terror attacks in Westminster, Manchester and at London Bridge. The plots that have been allegedly stopped in the same period will mean more cases in the courts. Many end up at the Old Bailey whose iconic scales of justice statue can be glimpsed across the water. Does the CPS have the resources to cope? Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders say it does. The BBC has spent the last two years gathering details of cases across the UKwhere Britons have been drawn into the civil war in Syria and Iraq. It is the most comprehensive public document of its kind, listing more than 150 profiles of people who are there or have been killed there and over 100 who have been convicted of offences related to the conflict. ""The numbers have just been incredible,"" says John, particularly after IS declared the creation of a caliphate and urged Muslims to travel out to defend it. Is there a typical convicted terrorist? No, says John, they come in different guises although ""the majority are relatively young men"". But there are also growing numbers of women drawn to the dark subculture of violent Islamism. The BBC's research shows that about a sixth of those prosecuted for terrorism in British courts over the past two years have been women. Who are Britain's jihadists? (5 July) UK terror convictions growing, BBC jihadist database shows (6 July) Christine says those women and girls who have travelled to Syria ""are not necessarily going out to participate in acts of terrorism - they are going out to support the people that are"". That makes it slightly difficult to decide how to prosecute them. Last year a former health worker from the West Midlands, Tareena Shakil, became the first woman to be convicted of joining IS. She had taken her toddler son to Turkey, telling friends and family that she was going on holiday. In fact she slipped across the border into Syria in October 2014. Birmingham Crown Court heard how she had previously made contact online with IS militants who had already travelled from the UK. One of them told her: ""Look sister, by staying in England, you're hanging over the gates of hell. If you die that's where you're going."" Once in the Syrian city of Raqqa, she posted images of her child wearing an IS-branded balaclava and next to an automatic firearm. In a text to the husband she had abandoned in the UK, she said: ""I want to die here as a martyrâ¦ if you don't like Isis, I won't talk to you anymore."" Tareena Shakil posted pictures from Raqqa of herself and her son with IS headwear and a gun But within a few months Shakil had a change of heart. During her trial she described how she took a taxi through several checkpoints on the edge of IS-controlled territory. She picked up her son, ""grabbed the nappies and ran across the fields - there were three IS fighters but they had their backs to me, they didn't see me"". She managed to make it over a barbed wire fence and across into Turkey. The judge at her trial accepted she was vulnerable but he jailed her for six years, telling her ""you were well aware that the future which you had subjected your son to was very likely to be indoctrination and thereafter life as a terrorist fighter"". Fortunately, Tareena Shakil's story is not typical. What may surprise people is how the vast majority - over 85% - of those convicted in the UK of terrorism linked to Syria and Iraq have never been there. Many plotted to go but were arrested before putting their plans into action. Others have been convicted of using social media to encourage support for banned groups such as Islamic State. ""Cases like that take a long time to build up. We scrutinise the evidence very, very carefully,"" says Christine, aware of the fine distinction between offensive speech and that which crosses the line into illegality. Under the Code for Crown Prosecutors the lawyers have to ask if there is a realistic prospect of conviction and whether prosecution is in the public interest. Christine admits to sometimes agonising over these decisions but she says that colleagues will feed in their thoughts. Decisions on terrorism prosecutions will often be signed off by the attorney general. But there are concerns that the definition of terrorism has been expanded to include activity that shouldn't be regarded as criminal. Recently a Kurdish political activist living in London was cleared at the Old Bailey of disseminating terrorist publications after handing out copies of a Turkish political magazine in Wood Green. Alison Saunders, the director of public prosecutions There is criticism too about whether the increasing levels of secrecy in terrorism cases in British criminal courts is undermining the ancient principle of justice being ""seen to be done"". National security has been invoked in a growing number of trials, which has sometimes led to the public and press being locked out of courtrooms. Alison Saunders says the jury get to hear all of the evidence but sometimes ""we have to be very careful about what we reveal because we need to protect our intelligence capability and techniques. Otherwise we will not be able to protect society in future."" In the aftermath of recent terror attacks there have been calls for a change of approach. The UK's most senior anti-terrorism police officer, Mark Rowley, has said: ""Where we have to step in to disrupt a potential attack before we have the best evidence, we need longer sentences for those convicted."" Prime Minister Theresa May has promised to set up a commission for counter-extremism as part of a battle aimed at ""stamping out"" violent ideology across society. But what is extreme and who decides? A much vaunted counter-extremism strategy, developed when Mrs May was home secretary, ran into the sand in the last parliament amid widespread concerns it was unworkable. Ms Saunders isn't clear how new laws in this area would help. ""Our terrorism laws are extremely comprehensive,"" she says. ""We do prosecute people for extreme views."" One of their biggest successes in recent years was the conviction of the hate preacher Anjem Choudary, although there was widespread concern that it didn't happen earlier. The now-convicted preacher Anjem Choudary How Anjem Choudary's mouth was finally shut (August 2016) Has al-Muhajiroun been underestimated? (June 2017) The scale of the challenge faced is shown in the data. The youngest person convicted was a boy from Blackburn who was just 14 when he plotted online with an Australian jihadist to carry out a beheading. The oldest was a 63-year-old driving instructor from Luton who handed out leaflets in support of IS on London's Oxford Street. Students have fallen foul of the law, as has a hospital director, a trainee teacher and the son of a police officer. Those convicted include married couples, siblings, a mother of six and a man who faked his own death in a doomed attempt to secretly slip back into the UK. In Syria he had posed for pictures holding a bag of severed heads. The most serious cases have been IS-inspired plots to kill people in the UK. John opens up a file called Operation Lanosity in which Londoner, Nadir Syed, 22, was convicted of plotting to carry out a beheading around Remembrance Day 2014. There is page after page of graphically violent imagery. Syed, who was obsessed with the murder of Drummer Lee Rigby in Woolwich, was arrested hours after buying a 30cm chef's knife. Nadir Syed, convicted in 2015 of plotting an IS-inspired terror attack on Remembrance Sunday The murder of eight people at London Bridge has highlighted yet again the devastating impact of low-tech attacks mounted by people under the spell of a pernicious ideology. In recent years much of the focus of discussion on the UK terror threat has been on those who return from Syria and Iraq. But some have speculated that the London Bridge attackers may have been drawn to violence on British streets because they were stopped from travelling to the Middle East. It's a danger Ms Saunders is aware of. ""We need to be acutely aware that if people can't go to Syria - and we have certainly seen this in some of the cases we have prosecuted - they may plan... an attack here instead or they may do more to radicalise other people here."" Has enough attention been paid to other incubators of violent extremism - such as Libya - where it is believed the plot was hatched to bomb the Manchester Arena? Large numbers of Britons went out to join the fighting against Col Muammar Gaddafi who was deposed in 2011. Another striking feature of the stats is the prominence of geographical clusters in which small, radical sub-cultures have developed, nurtured by friendship and kinship. From these have come angry and willing recruits for Islamic State. Friends and siblings have often travelled together to Syria, each sustaining the other on a collective mission, feeding each other's belief that they could change the course of history. Others have committed offences closer to home. And extremism sometimes manifests in surprising locations, involving families you might not imagine would be drawn into a conflict in another part of the world. When an email headed ""New Life"" dropped into her inbox, Church of England minister Sue Boyce eagerly opened it, desperate for news from its author, her son Jake. He hadn't been in touch for several months after leaving home in Walsall and then announcing he was about to cross from Turkey into Syria. Jake Petty - one of 850 jihadists who have travelled from the UK to the Middle East The email confirmed her worst fears. Petty - who was a convert to Islam - had received military training and was now a fighter with IS. ""Nobody has brainwashed me or tricked me into this,"" he wrote. ""You know that I am not bloodthirsty or have a love of violence. It's just in Islam, we are supposed to be one united community and whether my brother is being oppressed in Walsall or Iraq is no difference."" Petty is one of the 850 jihadists who have travelled from the UK to join jihadist groups in Syria and Iraq. About 130 of them have since been killed. Perhaps more astonishing is that he is not the only young man from Walsall to fight and die for IS in the Middle East. Two of his friends have died there. Two more are believed to be fighting and seven others are in jail for committing offences related to the conflict. You might ask what is happening in Walsall? But Walsall is not unique. When you start mapping the data we have collected you see some striking facts. In addition to the Walsall cluster, there are 91 people from London, 19 from Luton, 17 from Manchester, 15 from Birmingham, eight from Portsmouth, seven from Cardiff, six from Coventry and four from Brighton. ""Humans are social animals. They join movements or political parties or football clubs or the military. Joining the jihad is no different,"" says anthropologist Scott Atran, founder of Oxford University's Centre for the Resolution of Intractable Conflict and a student of terrorist networks for decades. This is a point worth remembering because too much emphasis has been placed on virtual networks in the recruitment process. Mr Atran says that only a fifth of IS recruits from the West have been recruited online: ""Young people are hooking up peer to peer. They talk to one another. They psyche one another up."" When Sue Boyce recovered from the shock of the email from her son, she contacted MI5. This triggered a major police and intelligence operation uncovering the Walsall cell and eventually leading to a string of convictions in the courts. But what the trials and statistics can never truly show is the depth of misery endured by the victims of the surge in IS recruitment, whether it's people killed at their hands or shattered families back at home.

"This video can not be played Martha Ricks' story, narrated by her descendent Florence Dennis-Huskin The two women, of a similar age, greeted each other warmly, shaking hands and smiling. One was the most powerful woman in the world - the other had been born into slavery. It had taken more than 50 years for Martha Ann Erskine Ricks of Liberia to finally fulfil her life-long dream. And her encounter with Great Britain's Queen Victoria was extraordinary in many ways. Extraordinary because it made such an impression on the queen that she wrote about it in her daily journal; because it was so warm; and because it happened at all. The queen and the farmer met in Windsor Castle on Saturday, 16 July 1892. Martha Ricks took with her a present of a satin quilt, embroidered with a coffee tree in full bloom, complete with red and green berries. ""At home, when a poor man comes to visit us on our farm, he never comes without some little present,"" Martha Ricks explained to the London-based newspaper, the Pall Mall Gazette, a few days after the meeting. ""How could I come to Queen Victoria, and bring her no present? ""I made it all myself, every stitch of it."" Surrounded by courtiers, her children and grandchildren, Queen Victoria told Martha that she ""felt greatly honoured by the trouble you have taken to come to see me,"" according to a report in the Daily Graphic, a leading illustrated newspaper of the time, which also carried a sketch of the meeting on its front page. Quageh quilting group in Caldwell in Liberia recreated Martha Ricks' Coffee Tree quilt In her diary the Queen described Martha as ""very loyalâ¦ with a kind face. I shook hands with her and she kept holding and shaking mine"". The hand-shaking also stayed with Martha, as she told the Pall Mall Gazette: ""She did not stay long in the golden room and I forgot what she said, but I shall never forget how she smiled and how she shook hands with me."" Martha had travelled a long distance to meet Queen Victoria - physically and metaphorically. She had been born into slavery in 1817 in Tennessee, in the southern United States. Her father George Erskine bought the family's freedom and, in 1830, when Martha was 13, the family of nine moved to Liberia, a West African country founded by former American and Caribbean slaves. Tragically, within a year, all but Martha and two brothers had died from fever. The quilt is very special for Martha Ricks' family Martha settled on a farm in Clay Ashland, which is today a quiet village located on the lush green banks of the St Paul River, about 10 or so miles (16km) east of the capital Monrovia. Clay Ashland was one of the first places settled by former slaves from the US who, with the help of the American Colonisation Society, had made West Africa their home from 1820 onwards. Martha became a farmer, growing her own vegetables and crops like ginger, cocoa, and coffee. She also gained quite a reputation as a gifted needlewoman, winning prizes at national fairs for her silk stockings. And she was skilled in the art of quilting - a tradition brought over from the south of America by the settlers. Martha, a former slave, had spent 50 years determined to meet the Queen ""Aunt Martha really did inspire the women of Liberia to do quilting,"" Evangeline Morris Dennis says of her ancestor. Martha Ricks was the great-aunt of Mrs Dennis' mother. ""When the idea came to Aunt Martha to make this present, the first thing that came to her was to give her a quilt of a coffee tree."" The reason why, says Mrs Dennis who is 83, is that coffee trees flourished on Martha's farm - and were, she says, a symbol of the potential of Liberia, which in 1847 had declared itself Africa's first republic. Mrs Dennis talks as if she had met Aunt Martha, although she did not. Newspapers at the time followed the story with great interest Martha died in 1901, by coincidence the same year as Queen Victoria. But Martha's stories have been handed down the generations and the stories of that event 125 years ago - and the quilt - are often spoken about. Martha Ricks's Coffee Tree quilt remains special to the family. And also to the history of Liberia, argues Kyra Hicks, a quilter, quilt historian and the author of the children's book Martha Ann's Quilt for Queen Victoria. ""Here was a former slave who had spent 50 years wanting to give this gift,"" she says. ""The sheer audacity of the faith she had to do that  - and her faith that she would, one day, see the Queen of England -  that was just marvellous."" Ms Hicks says Martha's quilt was the first Liberian quilt to be given as a diplomatic gift. The tradition was revived in 2005 when Ellen Johnson Sirleaf became Africa's first elected female president. She often gives quilts as presents to visiting dignitaries. President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf (L) recently gave this quilt of a cocoa tree to US Congresswoman Eddie Bernice Johnson So why did Martha Ricks feel so compelled to make a quilt for Queen Victoria? One reason is that the UK was the first country to recognise Liberia's independence - even before the US. And, in July 1892 when speaking to the Pall Mall Gazette, Martha herself tells us that it was because of Queen Victoria's support for the anti-slavery movement. ""I had heard it often, from the time I was a child, how good the Queen had been to my people - to slaves - and how she wanted us to be free."" Sadly, the quilt is now missing. But the family and Ms Hicks, who has spent more than seven years looking for it, hope that someday, someone could open a cupboard and find it.

"US President Donald Trump comes face-to-face with Russia's President Vladimir Putin for the first time on Friday. The formal meeting will be scrutinised across the world, set as it is against the backdrop of US investigations into possible collusion between Russia and Trump campaign figures during last year's election. Whether Mr Trump will raise the issue of election hacking is the million-dollar question, given he has downplayed Russia's alleged role. First meetings between major world leaders can be unpredictable affairs. Mr Trump has in the past suggested he could get along with Mr Putin and praised him as a ""strong leader"" but it is unclear how he feels now. Social media users imagine Trump and Putin's meeting In Moscow, the Kremlin is painting the meeting as an opportunity for the pair to ""get acquainted and finally understand the true approach of each other"". But looking beyond the testy politics of US-Russia relations, what do Mr Trump and Mr Putin have in common, and what sets them distinctly apart? If there's one sharp difference between these two men, it is their back stories. Vladimir Putin spent his early career in the world of Cold War espionage, and was working as a Soviet spy in East Germany when the communist state crumbled. He is used to operating in the shadows, and kept a low profile as an aide to the mayor of St Petersburg in the 1990s before taking the reins of the FSB intelligence agency and later the presidency. Mr Putin, an ex-spy, is seen as a tough and cunning leader Mr Putin has been at the top of Russian politics since 2000 and has the reputation of a cunning street fighter, an image that can be traced back to his days growing up in a tough communal housing block in Leningrad. He has said those years taught him that ""if a fight is inevitable, you have to throw the first punch"". What do they say about each other? Donald Trump, in contrast, was born into wealth as the son of a New York real estate tycoon. He managed to avoid being drafted into military service during the Vietnam War, and got started in real estate himself with a $1m loan from his father, eventually building a property, hotel and entertainment empire. Donald Trump is the first US president never to have held elected office or served in the military Far from keeping a low profile like Mr Putin, Mr Trump shot to stardom as host of reality TV show The Apprentice. He later used his fame and wealth as a springboard to make a bid for the Republican Party's presidential nomination in 2015. Yet though his public style is very different - brash and unpredictable where Mr Putin is comfortable yet controlled - like the Russian leader he doesn't shy away from a fight. Russia falling out love with Trump? Neither man hides his ambition to recover some sense of lost grandeur for his country. Mr Putin famously called the collapse of the Soviet Union ""the biggest geopolitical catastrophe of the [20th] Century"". Vladimir Putin: Russia's action man president Russia demands 'Putin corruption' proof His moves in Ukraine and Syria are seen as attempts to bolster Russia's power and influence, and hit back at the West for the expansion of Nato into Eastern Europe that he so resents. And Western European officials accuse him of meddling in their elections to try and weaken the European Union. This video can not be played Russian interference? No-one knows - Trump On his side, President Trump's stated ambition is to ""Make America Great Again"". For him this means boosting US military spending, putting pressure on allies to pay for more their own defence, and pulling out of efforts to fight climate change to protect jobs in domestic industries like coal. Mr Putin cultivates a more athletic macho image than Mr Trump, who is older and prefers golf to more extreme pursuits Nasty surprise: Vladimir Putin introduced Angela Merkel to his dog Koni in 2007 They also share a ""strongman"" style and macho attitudes which have shone through in meetings with world leaders. Mr Trump refused to shake German Chancellor Angela Merkel's hand during an awkward March photo-op, and pushed past Montenegro's prime minister at a Nato summit in Brussels in May to ensure he was front and centre. Vladimir Putin uses more calculated means to intimidate others, once letting his large labrador into a meeting with Mrs Merkel, who is afraid of dogs. The Trump White House is a family affair, something that certainly cannot be said of Vladimir Putin's Kremlin. President Trump's daughter, Ivanka, has an office in the West Wing and advises her father in an unpaid role. Her husband, Jared Kushner, is a senior adviser to the president and a significant force in the White House. His responsibilities stretch from the Middle East and China to criminal justice reform and relations with Mexico. The hotel developer who became president May to challenge Trump over climate change President Putin, on the other hand, zealously shields his private life and family from scrutiny. Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump play influential roles in the White House He and Lyudmila, his wife of nearly 30 years, announced their divorce in 2013, and his two daughters are kept well away from the public gaze. Little was known about them until media reports in 2015 revealed his youngest daughter Katerina was living in Moscow under a different name and working in a senior position at Moscow State University. She is also an acrobatic rock and roll dancer. Maria, the elder daughter, is an academic specialising in endocrinology. The differences in approach to family are stark. Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner's five-year-old daughter Arabella sang in Mandarin to Chinese President Xi Jinping during his US  visit in April. Mr Putin, meanwhile,recently refused,externalto disclose the names and ages of his two grandchildren. Family fitness: Mr Putin's younger daughter, Katerina Tikhonova, dances acrobatic rock 'n' roll Mr Trump might have popularised ""fake news"" as a pejorative term that politicians the world over can now hurl at journalists, but he's not alone in describing critical coverage as false. Mr Putin's government keeps a public list of foreign press stories that it says contains ""false information about Russia"". In dealing with the media, however, Vladimir Putin normally remains calm. Unlike Mr Trump, he does not fire off angry tweets about coverage he doesn't like - he is calculating and level-headed when taking questions from journalists. Russia's government takes umbrage at news stories it says are ""fake"" Leave Ukraine alone, Trump tells Russia Putin: From Russia's KGB to a presidency defined by war The other Ivankas around the world How rich is Russia's Vladimir Putin?

"Flying the flag for LGBT rights - Parliament shows it solidarity Westminster's ""palace of enchantments"" will be given an LGBTI gleam this weekend - lit up in the colours of the rainbow flag to mark both Pride Week and also the 50th anniversary of the Act of Parliament which legalised gay sex. The decision was taken by Commons Speaker John Bercow and the Lord Speaker, Lord Fowler, whoexplained their thinking in their first-ever joint interview, for Radio 4's Today in Parliament. Legalisation, in 1967, was the product of a ten-year parliamentary campaign to follow-up the 1957 Wolfenden Report which had recommended the decriminalisation of consenting male homosexual sex. There had been gathering pressure and determined resistance as the issue surfaced repeatedly in Parliament, with furious internal argument within the two main parties. Why is Pride important to you? My favourite moment was a question put by the Conservative former Lord Chancellor, Lord Kilmuir, who asked ""are your Lordships going to pass a bill that would make it lawful for two senior officers of police to go to bed together?"" The Conservative MP Humphrey Berkeley brought in a bill for reform, but lost his seat in the 1966 general election. He was not reselected, and was told that his local party could tolerate him being for either homosexual law reform or the abolition of hanging, but not both. The torch was passed to the Labour MP, Leo Abse, who won approval for a ten-minute rule bill in July 1966, by 244 votes to 100. Abse had the support of the new Home Secretary, Roy Jenkins, who battled in Cabinet to persuade reluctant colleagues to give government support to the Bill. Opponents thought it was the product of middle class liberalism and would alienate Labour's working-class base, but the government did eventually crucial provide extra debating time in the Commons, when Abse's private members bill faced a filibuster. The necessary 100 MPs needed to force votes at regular intervals in the debate was mustered, and at 5.50am on the morning of July 4, 1966, the Bill passed its Third Reading by 99 votes to 14, after a 20-hour sitting. Labour MP Leo Abse's bill decriminalising gay sex was a landmark moment in post-war British history Legalisation was presented in an apologetic way - a measure to end the criminalisation of unfortunates - and not a ""vote of confidence in homosexuality"". The age of consent was set at 21, and despite attempts to lower it by, among others, the Conservative Edwina Currie, it remained at that age until 2000. Even after legalisation, the personal consequences for MPs and others in the public eye of being outed were still devastating. There were cases like that of Maureen Colquhoun, a Labour MP elected in Northampton in 1974, who brought in bills on abortion, gender balance and the protection of prostitutes. Her relationship with another woman was revealed in the Daily Mail. She defeated two attempts to deselect her, and she was forced to campaign for re-election in 1979, with some party members refusing to support her because of her private life, rather than her politics. She lost. Maureen Colquhoun saw off two attempts to deselect her Perhaps the most high profile example was that of someone who never actually made it into Parliament, Peter Tatchell, the Labour candidate in the 1983 Bermondsey by-election, whose homosexuality became an election issue. In an interview on Radio 4's Today in Parliament on Friday, Joanna Cherry, the gay SNP MP, said the level of ""hate filled homophobia"" he faced deterred her from any idea of a career in politics - although she would have liked (at that time) to be a Labour MP. Labour's Chris Smith, a future Culture Secretary, was the first MP to come out as gay, in 1984. And there was also legislation, like Section 28 of the 1988 Local Government Act, which said local councils could not ""intentionally promote homosexuality or publish material with the intention of promoting homosexuality"" or ""promote the teaching in any maintained school of the acceptability of homosexuality as a pretended family relationship"". This video can not be played Westminster tribute: 50 years after gay sex decriminalisation No prosecution was ever brought under Section 28, but it had considerable impact on, for example, lesbian, gay and bisexual support groups in schools and colleges. It was repealed in 2000. In recent years the battles have tended to be on legislation designed to be anti-discriminatory, first the creation of Civil Partnerships, then the legislation to allow same-sex couples to marry, and most recently the ""Turing Bill"" to pardon gay men convicted for offences that would not be considered crimes today. Today, Speaker Bercow's coat of arms features LGBT colours. And for Norman Fowler, the Lord Speaker, his experience as health secretary in the 1980s, when AIDS emerged as a major public health issue, it brought the issue for discrimination against gay people into focus. Both wanted Parliament to pay its respects to the LGBT community and to show solidarity. ""We have gone in half a century from the criminalisation of one type of love to almost complete legal equality,"" Mr Bercow said. Lord Fowler said the lighting of one of the most famous buildings in the world would be a symbol to people who were being persecuted. Why is Pride important to you?

"Mohammed Haji Sadiq had denied committing 15 child sex offences over a 10-year period An 81-year-old former Koran teacher who was convicted of a string of child sex offences has been jailed for 13 years. Mohammed Haji Sadiq taught for 30 years at Cardiff's Madina mosque and abused four girls as a form of punishment. He was found guilty of eight sexual assaults on a child under 13 by touching, and six indecent assaults after a trial at Cardiff Crown Court. The court heard Sadiq, of Cyncoed, ""took advantage of his position"". Koran teacher guilty of child sex abuse Koran teacher denies pupil sex assaults Mosque tutor used 'physical punishment' This video can not be played Being abused by paedophile Koran teacher Mohammed Haji Sadiq 'felt normal eventually', says victim He had denied the charges involving four girls aged between five and 11 and blamed ""politics"" in the mosque for the accusations. But sentencing him, Judge Stephen Hopkins QC told Sadiq: ""Children called you 'uncle' as a mark of respect.  You are a man in my judgement of some cunning."" He added: ""Beneath the veneer there is a dark and deviant side."" Sadiq, who was a part-time Imam, sexually assaulted two girls under the age of 13 by touching, and indecently assaulted two other girls over a decade between 1996 and 2006 at the Woodville Road mosque. He abused them if they made a mistake while reciting the Koran and would use a stick as a form of punishment in class, hitting people over the hand or hard on the back. Some of his victims said they were afraid to attend the mosque because of his abuse. One said she had attempted to take her own life because of the abuse. In victim impact statements read to the court, others said they felt they could not tell anyone about the abuse because of the culture they grew up in. The court heard one victim feared the consequences of speaking out following Sadiq's conviction. She said: ""Due to my religion it was very difficult, almost impossible to tell anyone what had happened"". She added: ""In the Muslim religion we do not talk about personal matters"". Another victim said it was ""not acceptable"" in her culture to talk about what was happening at the mosque. She said: ""I remember the relief I felt when I told my mother, and she believed me and went to the police. ""In my family honour is very important, but my family have been very supportive"". Sadiq has had no involvement in the mosque since 2006 when it burnt down and was re-sited elsewhere in the city. He was cleared of one indecent assault after his trial last month. In addition to his jail sentence, he was issued with a sexual harm prevention order and will have to register as a sex offender. Det Ch Insp Rob Cronick of South Wales Police praised the ""immense courage"" of the victims who came forward. ""As a result of the verdict and today's sentence I believe there may be members of the community who may now feel confident enough to speak to the police or our support agencies,"" he added. Mike Jenkin from the CPS said: ""These women have shown remarkable courage in coming forward to speak about the abuse they suffered at the hands of Mohammed Haj Sadiq when they were young girls. ""Sadiq was a respected figure in the community with considerable influence and power which makes the bravery of his victims all the more admirable. ""The evidence given by these women meant the prosecution was able to present a compelling case to the jury, resulting in the guilty verdicts."" A spokesman for the children's charity NSPCC said: ""This was an appalling breach of trust and Sadiq has rightly received a significant prison sentence for these heinous offences."" A Muslim Council of Wales spokeswoman said: ""We applaud the bravery and courage of the young women who now, as adults, pursued the case and pursued justice. ""Mr Sadiq was not an imam but a volunteer teacher at the former Madina Mosque. ""All mosques in Wales now have Child Protection Policies in place, and teachers and volunteers alike are all vetted and closely monitored.""

"Photos of Miss South Africa wearing gloves while visiting black children at an orphanage in Soweto sparked a online outcry - but the orphanage staff say any insinuation that Demi-Leigh Nel-Peters is racist is ""ridiculous"". ""Of course it wasn't because she didn't want to touch black children,"" says Carol Dyantyi, a spokesperson for the Orlando West Community Centre Ikageng. Nel-Peters was volunteering to feed orphans at the centre, and the gloves were a health and safety measure. ""We told her, and all other volunteers, to wear them while they were handling food around the children,"" Dyantyi tells BBC Trending. ""It was purely to protect the children from the risk of contaminated food. This social media reaction is ridiculous."" Thousands of Twitter users criticised Nel-Peters after photos of her at a soup drive on Wednesday began to circulate on social media. Many accused the beauty queen of wearing the latex gloves ""because she didn't want to touch black children"" and shared images of her hugging dogs and white children with bare hands. In a video posted,externalto her Twitter account, Nel-Peters said that she wore the gloves for sanitary reasons and denied that were any racial undertones to her actions. ""All the volunteers on site wore gloves today because we honestly thought that it's the right thing to do while working with food and while handing out food to young kids,"" Nel-Peters said. She also apologised to those who were offended. Claudia Henkel, a spokesperson for the beauty queen, also sent images to BBC Trending of Nel-Peters gloveless and playing with the children after the food had been served. BBC Trending on Facebook,external However, not everyone was satisfied with her response. The hashtag#MissSAChallenge,externalbegan to trend on Twitter on Thursday, as South Africans poked fun of the ""hygiene"" reason cited for the gloves. More than 18,000 tweets used the hashtag, and some users posted pictures of themselves doing mundane tasks whilst unnecessarily wearing gloves. Not all of the responses were critical and others defended Miss South Africa. Henkel tells Trending that whilst the social media backlash had ""saddened"" Nel-Peters, she is adamant about doing more soup drives in the near future. ""And if she is asked to wear gloves for the safety of the children, then she will again,"" Henkel adds.

"Janice Farman had been in Mauritius since 2004 A 47-year-old woman from Clydebank has died in Mauritius after being killed in front of her child during a robbery by masked men at her home. Janice Farman, who lived with her 10-year-old autistic son, died of asphyxiation during Friday's attack. She had been in the Indian Ocean country since 2004 and was working as a director of a data services group. Police believe Mrs Farman was killed during a robbery by three men. One man has been arrested, local media said. The BBC's World Service correspondent in Mauritius, Yasine Mohabuth, said she had recently moved to Albion, in the west of the island, an area previously known for burglaries. He said: ""A fight took place between the three robbers and the victim in the presence of her 10-year-old son. ""Police said that she was smothered to death in her bed. ""They had arrived at three in the morning. It was her son that alerted a friend. The burglars stole many things, including her jewellery and her car. ""Her son is now under the care of the child development unit because his father is abroad."" Mrs Farman's Nissan Tiida was later found by police at the side of the road A post-mortem examination has since confirmed that Mrs Farman died as a result of asphyxiation caused by compression of the neck. Mrs Farman's Nissan Tiida was later found by police at the side of the road. She was originally from Clydebank in West Dunbartonshire and was working as the managing director of PECS (Mauritius) Ltd, a privately owned group of companies providing data services. A colleague said that he had been contacted by her son in the early hours of Friday, who had told him that his mother was ""not breathing"". In a post on social media, he wrote: ""Just imagine.... He clearly had no idea what was going on and he was simply in a state of shock. We called the police and it was later confirmed she did not make it."" He referred to Mrs Farman as his mentor and claimed that ""Mauritius was no longer a paradise."" In a statement from Mrs Farman's employer, Stephen Littlechild from PECS data services, said: ""Last night our MD in Mauritius Janice Farman was brutally murdered in her own home. ""In view of these tragic events, we have decided to close our Mauritius office today, so we can make sure all our team have access to counsellors and as a mark of respect to a wonderful lady. ""Our thoughts are with Janice's family, friends and colleagues."" The British Foreign Office said it was in contact with local authorities in Mauritius about the case.

"Oral sex is producing dangerous gonorrhoea and a decline in condom use is helping it to spread, the World Health Organization has said. It warns that if someone contracts gonorrhoea, it is now much harder to treat, and in some cases impossible. The sexually transmitted infection is rapidly developing resistance to antibiotics. Experts said the situation was ""fairly grim"" with few new drugs on the horizon. About 78 million people pick up the STI each year and it can cause infertility. The World Health Organization analysed data from 77 countries which showed gonorrhoea's resistance to antibiotics was widespread. Dr Teodora Wi, from the WHO, said there had even been three cases - in Japan, France and Spain - where the infection was completely untreatable. She said: ""Gonorrhoea is a very smart bug, every time you introduce a new class of antibiotics to treat gonorrhoea, the bug becomes resistant."" Worryingly, the vast majority of gonorrhoea infections are in poor countries where resistance is harder to detect. ""These cases may just be the tip of the iceberg,"" she added. Gonorrhoea can infect the genitals, rectum and throat, but it is the last that is most concerning health officials. Dr Wi said antibiotics could lead to bacteria in the back of the throat, including relatives of gonorrhoea, developing resistance. She said: ""When you use antibiotics to treat infections like a normal sore throat, this mixes with theNeisseriaspecies in your throat and this results in resistance."" Thrusting gonorrhoea bacteria into this environment through oral sex can lead to super-gonorrhoea. ""In the US, resistance [to an antibiotic] came from men having sex with men because of pharyngeal infection,"" she added. A decline in condom use, which had soared because of fears of HIV/Aids, is thought to help the infection spread. The disease is caused by the bacterium calledNeisseria gonorrhoea. The infection is spread by unprotected vaginal, oral and anal sex. Symptoms can include a thick green or yellow discharge from sexual organs, pain when urinating and bleeding between periods. However, of those infected, about one in 10 heterosexual men and more than three-quarters of women, and gay men, have no easily recognisable symptoms. Untreated infection can lead to infertility, pelvic inflammatory disease and can be passed on to a child during pregnancy. The World Health Organization is calling on countries to monitor the spread of resistant gonorrhoea and to invest in new drugs. BBC Radio 1 - Myth-busting STIs Pubic hair grooming 'STI risk from cuts' Dr Manica Balasegaram, from the Global Antibiotic Research and Development Partnership, said: ""The situation is fairly grim. ""There are only three drug candidates in the entire drug [development] pipeline and no guarantee any will make it out."" But ultimately, the WHO said vaccines would be needed to stop gonorrhoea. Prof Richard Stabler, from the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, said: ""Ever since the introduction of penicillin, hailed as a reliable and quick cure, gonorrhoea has developed resistance to all therapeutic antibiotics. ""In the past 15 years therapy has had to change three times following increasing rates of resistance worldwide. ""We are now at a point where we are using the drugs of last resort, but there are worrying signs as treatment failure due to resistant strains has been documented."" Follow Jameson Twitter,external. It's hard to say if more people around the world are having more oral sex than they used to, as there isn't much reliable global data available. Data from the UK and US show it's very common, and has been for years, including among teenagers. The UK's first National Survey of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles, carried out in 1990-1991, found 69.7% of men and 65.6% of women had given oral sex to, or received it from, a partner of the opposite sex in the previous year. By the time of the second survey during 1999-2001, this had increased to 77.9% for men and 76.8% for women, but hasn't changed much since. A national survey in the US, meanwhile, has found about two-thirds of 15-24 year olds have ever had oral sex. Dr Mark Lawton from the British Association for Sexual Health and HIV said people with gonorrhoea in the throat would be unlikely to realise it and thus be more likely to pass it on via oral sex. He recognises that while condoms would reduce the risk of transmission, many people wouldn't want to use them. ""My message would be to get tested so at least if you've got it you know about it,"" Dr Lawton said.

"The bronze statue has already been created Concerns that a statue of Lady Thatcher may be vandalised should not stop it going ahead, Theresa May has said. Those behind the bronze ""life size and-a-half"" statue, created by the sculptor Douglas Jennings want it to go up in Parliament Square. But there have been a series of objections, including the possibility it could be vandalised and that it does not have the Thatcher family's backing. The Parliamentary Estate has also objected to the proposal. It has pointed out there is already a statue of Lady Thatcher in the Commons and that Westminster Council's own planning guidelines state Parliament Square - home to 11 statues - is within the ""monument saturation zone, considered unsuitable for new memorials"" and that statues should adhere to a rule that they do not go up within 10 years of the subject's death. The statue would be mounted on a stone plinth A local conservation group, the Thorney Island Society, has commented on the application, saying the 10-year-rule should be adhered to, despite the fact a statue to Nelson Mandela was put up before his death. The group said: ""While Lady Thatcher was also widely respected it cannot be said that she was uncontroversial in this country. ""There is a strong case for the ten-year rule to be respected - there should be a decent interval before permanent statues are erected, especially when they are controversial enough to risk vandalism."" The society adds: ""We understand that Lady Thatcher's daughter dislikes the statue."" The Thatcher family has been contacted for a comment. Asked about reports that the statue had effectively been blocked over concerns about vandalism, Mrs May told the BBC: ""I understand there are a number of issues that have been raised around the statue. What I'm very clear about is there should be no suggestion that the threat of vandalism should stop a statue of Margaret Thatcher from being put up."" At a briefing later, her spokesman said it was a decision for Westminster Council but added that ""statues are a key part of this country's heritage"" and those in Parliament Square were an ""important reminder of people who've played a key role in this country's history"". The statue proposal has yet to go before a planning committee and even if it was granted permission - it would then have to get the approval of the Royal Parks, which manages the Parliament Square site. The Royal Parks has objected to the application. Lady Thatcher was Britain's longest serving prime minister of modern times A spokesman said: ""Numerous times we have requested assurances from the applicant that they have approval from the family for the statue. To date we have not had those assurances."" Lady Thatcher, who was Conservative prime minister from 1979 until 1990, died on 8 April 2013, following a stroke, at the age of 87. The Public Memorials Appeal Trust - a charity which has raised the money to erect the statue - said it was chosen to portray the former PM in her state robes, ""her most dignified attire,"" with ""a resolute posture looking towards the Houses of Parliament, with a stern gaze slightly rightwards, akin with her political leanings"". Its preferred site for the statue and stone plinth is on the west side of Parliament Square, on Canning Green, between the existing statues of former prime minister George Canning and Abraham Lincoln - two of 11 statues in the square. In April it was announced that the suffragist Dame Millicent Fawcett would become the first woman to be honoured with a statue in the square. Other statues of Lady Thatcher include one by sculptor Antony Dufort, in the members' lobby of the House of Commons, unveiled in 2007, and a bronze bust in a museum in her home town of Grantham. In 2002 a protester decapitated a Â£150,000 Italian marble statue of Lady Thatcher at London's Guildhall Library and the statue of another former PM, Sir Winston Churchill, has occasionally been the target of vandalism in Parliament Square, the site of many protests over the years.

"This video can not be played What does body language tell us about the Trump-Putin G20 meeting? Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin have held their first face-to-face talks, on the sidelines of the G20 summit in the German city of Hamburg. ""It's an honour to be with you,"" Mr Trump told Mr Putin, who responded: ""I'm delighted to meet you personally."" Both sides listed a wide range of topics discussed, including Russia's alleged meddling in the US election. Climate change and trade are set to dominate the two-day G20 meeting. Violent clashes between protesters and police have taken place in the streets outside the venue, with dozens left injured. A huge police operation is trying to keep demonstrators - who are protesting against the presence of Mr Trump and Mr Putin, climate change and global wealth inequalities - well away from the summit venue, and water cannon have been deployed. Earlier, US First Lady Melania Trump was unable to leave her hotel in Hamburg because of the protests. Trump and Putin shake hands - filmed by the German government Donald and Vladimir: How do they compare? Who are the G20 protesters? ""Putin and I have been discussing various things, and I think it's going very well,"" Mr Trump told reporters while sitting alongside Mr Putin at the start of the talks, which were open to the media. ""We've had some very, very good talks. We're going to have a talk now and obviously that will continue. We look forward to a lot of very positive things happening for Russia, for the United States and for everybody concerned."" Mr Putin, via a translator, said that while they had spoken by phone, a phone conversation was never as good as meeting face to face. Both men ignored shouted questions from reporters as the meeting went into private session. This video can not be played Police and anti-summit protesters clashed for a second day Speaking afterwards, Mr Putin said: ""I've had a very long conversation with the US president. We had a lot of issues to discuss, including Ukraine, Syria, and other problems, also some bilateral issues. ""We have again returned to the fight against terror and to cyber security."" Secretary of State Rex Tillerson largely confirmed these were the topics covered, saying the leaders connected quickly and had positive chemistry. But the two sides seem unable to agree on the exact outcome of talks over the Russian hacking allegations. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Mr Trump accepted Mr Putin's assertions that they were not true. Mr Tillerson, meanwhile, said the two men had had a ""robust"" discussion on the issue during the two hour and 15 minute meeting, and that Mr Trump had pressed the Russian leader on several occasions. However, he said it was not clear whether the two countries would ever come to an agreement on what happened. ""I think the president is rightly focused on how do we move forward from something that may be an intractable disagreement at this point,"" Mr Tillerson said, according to theAssociated Press news agency,external. Mr Tillerson also said they had discussed Syria and its future, and shared ""commonalities on what outcome should be"", although they had different ideas on how to get there. They have, however, agreed to declare a ceasefire in south-west Syria from Sunday, Mr Lavrov said. Earlier, a brief videoclip posted on the German government's Facebook page,externalshowed Mr Trump and Mr Putin meeting for the first time and shaking hands, with Mr Trump patting Mr Putin's arm as they smiled in the company of other leaders. The words were warm enough, but the body language was restrained as this meeting began. Neither man was smiling much as both said they hoped for positive results from their encounter. Their handshake, when it finally came, was brief and businesslike. But they clearly had plenty to talk about, as their meeting went on well over the time allocated. Russia sees that alone as a success, proof that Vladimir Putin is a global leader to be reckoned with. No-one here is expecting any big deals though, like lifting sanctions for example. The Kremlin has stressed all along that its main aim is to establish a ""working dialogue"" with Donald Trump, and perhaps begin the slow process of restoring relations with the US, which are at their lowest point in many years. The two men staked out opposing views on major international issues in the run-up to the summit: On Thursday, Mr Trump used a speech in the Polish capital Warsawto call on Russia to stop ""destabilising"" Ukraineand other countries, and ""join the community of responsible nations"" Setting out his own G20 agenda in German financial newspaper Handelsblatt, Mr Putin called for US-led sanctions on his country, imposed in response to Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014, to be lifted Mr Putin also argued strongly in favour of the Paris climate agreement, saying it was a ""secure basis for long-term climate regulation"" and Russia wanted to make a ""comprehensive contribution to its implementation"" President Trump has taken the US out of the Paris agreement This video can not be played Mr Trump was once popular in Russia, but opinion there has turned against him since he came into office The G20 (Group of Twenty) is a summit for 19 countries, both developed and developing, plus the EU. In her summit opening statement, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said: ""We are all aware of the great global challenges. ""We know that time is short and therefore solutions very often can only be found if we are ready to compromise and work together without bending over backwards too much because, of course, we can express different views on some issues."" Cornering Trump on climate change G20 in pictures Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has urged G20 leaders to impress upon Mr Trump that he should act as a role model in addressing climate change. ""We'll tell him it's important to take a lead role in tackling climate change and creating good jobs,"" he told German tabloid Bild, according to Reuters news agency. Mrs Merkel has said the G20 willfocus on the Paris climate dealbut, as the G20 host, she will work to find compromises. Mrs Merkel and other EU leaders have also expressed their commitment to an open international trading system, while the Trump administration pursues protectionism under the ""America First"" motto. On Friday, the US first lady had been due to take part in an excursion with other leaders' spouses, but her spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham said: ""The Hamburg police could not give us clearance to leave.""

"Many companies are in full ""panic"" mode, says KPMG's Mark Thompson The European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) comes into force in May 2018, radically changing the way organisations have to look after our personal data. Failure to comply could lead to huge fines, yet many businesses are far from ready. Here's why you should care. A new EU regulation governing how organisations should handle and protect our personal data. Many of the stipulations are already covered by the UK's Data Protection Act; but simply put, organisations need to keep records of all personal data, be able to prove that consent was given, show where the data's going, what it's being used for, and how it's being protected. Accountability is the new watchword. If personal data gets stolen after a cyber-attack, companies have to report the breach within 72 hours of realising it. And the definition of personal data has been extended to include extra categories such as your computer's IP address or your genetic make-up - anything that could be used to identify you. Non-compliance with the GDPR could lead to huge fines of 20 million euros or 4% of global turnover, whichever is the greater. For a company like tech giant Apple, that could amount to billions of dollars. Consult Hyperion, an electronic financial transactions specialist, forecasts that European financial institutions could face fines totalling 4.7bn euros (Â£4.1bn; $5.3bn) in the first three years following the GDPR coming into force. Is this your firm's attitude to GDPR? Anthony Lee, a partner in law firm DMH Stallard, says: ""Talk Talk [a UK telecoms company] was fined Â£400,000 for failing to prevent the 2015 customer data breach, but under the new regime fines could be many multiples of this."" However, a spokesperson for the UK's Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) - the body responsible for enforcing GDPR in the UK - says: ""The new law equals bigger fines for getting it wrong but it's important to recognise the business benefits of getting data protection right. ""There is a real opportunity for organisations to present themselves on the basis of how they respect the privacy of individuals - and gain a competitive edge. ""But if your organisation can't demonstrate that good data protection is a cornerstone of your business policy and practices when the new law comes in next year, you're leaving your organisation open to enforcement action that can damage both public reputation and bank balance."" The new regulation builds on existing data protection law, but strengthens the rules around customers' consent, giving us the right to withdraw consent whenever we like. We already have the right to see what personal data organisations hold on us - we can make what's called a ""subject access request"" for free - and we can demand that such data be rectified or deleted under the ""right to be forgotten"". The new regulation puts consumers back in the driving seat when it comes to their personal data So in short, we have more control and power. ""Many businesses have no idea what to do and don't want to grasp the nettle,"" says Mark Thompson, a partner in KPMG's privacy advisory practice. ""There's a lot of misinformation and panic around at the moment, but if businesses don't take responsibility for this at board level they will fail. ""This will affect every part their business."" And Chris Daly, chief executive of the Chartered Institute of Marketing, says: ""There is a real lack of awareness about this issue in our sector - 60% thought it wouldn't affect their business at all."" Many firms haven't even begun getting ready to comply with the new regulation GDPR specialist EMW Law believes just 29% of UK businesses have begun preparing for the change, ""a shocking figure, as on average organisations need 12-15 months to prepare"", the firm says. With cyber-attacks on the rise and growing in sophistication, data breaches are becoming almost inevitable. So will your firm be able to demonstrate that it took all reasonable steps to protect personal data from this threat? Will it be able to show that it reported any breach within the 72-hour window following discovery? One of the reasons many businesses seem unprepared for GDPR is that they don't know enough about the data they hold, argues Rashmi Knowles, European chief technology officer at security firm RSA. ""A lot of companies don't even know where their data is, how it is being used, or what policies are in place governing how it can be used,"" she says. So the first and most important task is to carry out a comprehensive data audit and make sure the top brass are fully behind this. More Technology of Business The 'Babypod' carrier that comes with an F1 pedigree Why your bananas could soon cost more in the afternoon Ant power: The bus that runs on formic acid Research by Sharp finds that a quarter of workers interviewed admitted to storing work information in the public cloud against company policy, two-fifths use their own devices at work, and a third take work home with them. All these practices are potential security weaknesses. Personal data - from customer databases to employee payroll information - may well be insecure without your firm even knowing it. But ignorance of this will be no excuse under the GDPR. ""There are hundreds of thousands of documents online that shouldn't be publicly available,"" says James Chappell at security company Digital Shadows. ""Supply chains are often not looking after customer data properly."" And this is a point many companies are overlooking, warns Mr Lee. If this is how your subcontractor treats customer data, you could be in trouble ""If you want to share data with a third party you must show that the sub-contractors will keep that data safe and private,"" he says. ""That's a big problem because most subcontractor contracts don't have these clauses in them. Organisations need to start renegotiating these contracts now."" Although the GDPR applies to data processing carried out by organisations operating within the EU, it also applies to organisations outside the EU offering goods or services to EU citizens. The GDPR will replace the UK's Data Protection Act 1998 from 25 May 2018 and the government has confirmed that the UK's decision to leave the EU will not change this. So Brexit is no ""get of jail free"" card. There are lots of companies offering to help organisations prepare for GDPR, and theUK's Information Commissioner's Office has an entire section of its website,externalgiving advice and information. TheEuropean Union's GDPR website,externalis also an obvious place to start.

"South Park regularly mocks President Trump in its weekly episodes South Park is to make fewer jokes about Donald Trump, its co-creator has said.

He said the series should stick to the ""bread and butter"" of ""kids being kids and being ridiculous and outrageous"". Recently, the show has seen teacher Mr Garrison campaign for president on the basis he would build a wall to keep out Canadians - a reference to the wall President Trump wants to build on the Mexican border.

"Many of those crossing to Spain in flimsy boats are from sub-Saharan Africa It is believed to be the worst tragedy in the Western Mediterranean this year - 49 sub-Saharan Africans attempting to reach Spain are missing after the boat they were travelling in capsized. Their dinghy was found deflated 28 nautical miles west of the island of AlborÃ¡n, midway between the Moroccan coast and Spain. Three survivors were rescued by the Spanish coastguard on Tuesday. The 17-year-old and two men aged 25 were all taken to Tarifa for treatment for hypothermia and burns. But hope has faded of finding anyone else alive. The boat had apparently set out with 52 people aboard on Sunday morning and had drifted for days before being hit by a strong wave. Rescue teams found more boats packed with migrants on Wednesday There has been a sharp rise in migrant arrivals on Spain's south coast this year. Since the start of 2017, 6,464 migrants crossed the Mediterranean to Spain, according to the International Organization for Migration (IOM). The total in 2016 was just over 8,000 migrants last year, making up only 2% of the total of so-called ""irregular arrivals"" to the EU. Migrants feared drowned off Morocco Migrant talks as Italy eyes port closures Austria raises tension over border troops The vast majority of the 101,000 who have crossed the Mediterranean this year have arrived via Italy. The number of fatalities is put at 2,247. Even before this tragedy, 60 migrants are believed to have drowned in the Western Mediterranean this year. AndalucÃ­a human rights charity APDHA estimates that 6,000 people have drowned trying to cross that stretch of water since 1997. ""Right now we've got the capacity to handle this but it is stretching us,"" said Samuel Linares, provincial co-ordinator of the Red Cross in MÃ¡laga, on Spain's south coast. ""The resources in the province of MÃ¡laga were set up for the numbers arriving two or three years ago and since then they have multiplied by three or four times."" The vast majority of migrants coming to Spain are sub-Saharan Africans fleeing poverty or conflict in their home countries. Many of those who make the journey come from West African nations such as Guinea or Ivory Coast. A common route is by land through Mali and Algeria, then on to Morocco, which at its nearest point is only eight nautical miles from the Spanish mainland. The Red Cross is struggling with the increasing numbers crossing from Morocco Migrants often camp out in forests near ports such as Nador, in northern Morocco, as they prepare for the final part of their journey. Although people traffickers are often involved in organising boats for crossings, groups of migrants also pool their money to get hold of motorised, inflatable boats in which they set off from the Moroccan coast. Can jobs keep Eritrean refugees out of Europe? Refugees frustrated in chilly Baltic states The usually calm summer months are particularly popular for crossings but, as the latest tragedy shows, a rogue wave or unexpected weather can make the journey a lethal one. Internal factors within particular countries of origin can also encourage exoduses. Recent social unrest in northern Morocco's Rif region, for example, has triggered a new migratory tendency. This video can not be played BBC speaks to migrants fleeing Libya ""The people who come to Spain on boats have generally been sub-Saharan Africans,"" says Jon IÃ±Ã¡rritu, a senator who sits on Spanish parliamentary commissions for domestic and foreign affairs. ""But in recent days we've seen people arriving from Rif, requesting political asylum."" Migrants who reach Spain or Spanish waters are given medical attention before they are placed in police custody and then housed in the short term either in a migrant stay centre or in accommodation provided by an NGO. And, when they have recovered, that will likely be the fate of the three survivors from the rescue west of AlborÃ¡n. Many of those who arrive lack documents and are often reluctant to reveal their true country of origin, especially if it has a repatriation agreement with Spain. It can take several months before migrants find out if they are to be allowed to stay in Spain or if they are to be sent back home. A note on terminology:The BBC uses the term migrant to refer to all people on the move who have yet to complete the legal process of claiming asylum. This group includes people fleeing war-torn countries such as Syria, who are likely to be granted refugee status, as well as people who are seeking jobs and better lives, who governments are likely to rule are economic migrants.

"Iman FM broadcast a series of lectures by radical American Muslim cleric Anwar al-Awlaki A community radio station has been taken off air for broadcasting more than 25 hours of lectures by an alleged al-Qaeda leader. Sheffield-based Iman FM had its licence suspended by Ofcom for playing the lectures byradical American Muslim cleric Anwar al-Awlaki. Theregulator said,externalparts of the material was ""likely to encourage or incite crime or lead to disorder"". Iman FM told Ofcom it was not aware of Awlaki's background. More stories from across Yorkshire In 2011 the United Nations Security Council described Awlaki as a ""leader, recruiter and trainer for al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula"". His sermons are thought to have inspired terrorist attacks including theattack on the Charlie Hebdooffices in Paris in 2015 in which 12 people died and the2009 Fort Hood shootings, in which 13 US soldiers were killed. Awlaki was killed in a US drone strike in 2011. Ofcom said information about Awlaki's alleged terrorist links was ""freely available"". It launched an investigation of the station after a member of the public complained about the content of the lectures. The station said it had downloaded and broadcast Awlaki's lectures during Ramadan - 26 May to 24 June - despite not having listened to them in their entirety beforehand. Anwar al-Awlaki advocated violent jihad against the United States It said it had listened to 12 hours of the audio, which it ""judged to be within the parameters [of the Broadcasting Code]"", but only samples of the remainder were checked. The licensee said it had not listened to all of the lectures because of time constraints, it being a small radio station and the broadcasts happening during Ramadan. It said that management had not picked up on the issue, not least because of the timing of the broadcasts when managers were ""probably catching up on sleep"". The station then broadcast a show on 23 June in which it condemned the lectures and apologised to listeners. In its ruling Ofcom said it considered the breaches of the Broadcasters Code to be ""extremely serious"". It said it planned to revoke Iman FM's licence and had given the station 21 days to respond. In astatement,externalposted on its Facebook page, Iman FM said: ""[It] has temporarily stopped broadcasting, this has resulted due to the regulator suspending its licence for the next 21 days, on the basis that unwittingly some controversial lectures were broadcast.""

"House prices in the UK fell by 1% in June, the largest monthly fall since January, according to Britain's largest lender, the Halifax. It brings the average price of a house or flat down to Â£218,390. The rolling quarterly figure, which measures changes over the previous three months, fell by 0.1%. It is the third month running that figure has fallen - the first time that has happened since November 2012. Measured on an annual basis, the growth in house prices eased from 3.3% in May to 2.6% in June, the lowest increase for four years. The Halifax said,externalone reason for the slowdown was the fact that consumers were increasingly being squeezed as increases in incomes failed to keep up with inflation. ""Although employment levels continue to rise, household finances face increasing pressure as consumer prices grow faster than wages,"" said Martin Ellis, Halifax's housing economist. ""This, combined with the new stamp duty on buy-to-let and second homes in 2016, appears to have weakened housing demand in recent months."" However monthly figures - and to a lesser extent quarterly figures - can be volatile. One economist said he did not expect a continuing fall in prices over the rest of the year. ""The dip in Halifax's measure of house pricesâwhich dragged year-over-year growth down to its lowest rate since May 2013âprobably doesn't mark the start of a sustained fall in prices,"" said Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. ""The index is volatile even at the best of times, and Nationwide reported a 1.1% month-to-month rise in its similar measure of prices in June. The underlying trend in prices probably is flat."" The number of properties being sold has also held up relatively well. Figures from HM Revenue and Customs show that the number of sales in the three months to May was 1% higher than in the previous quarter.

"Tesla chief Elon Musk said the battery was the world's largest ""by a significant margin"" An Australian state will install the world's largest lithium ion battery in a ""historic"" deal with electric car firm Tesla and energy company Neoen. The battery will protect South Australia from the kind of energy crisis which famouslyblacked outthe state, Premier Jay Weatherill said. Tesla boss Elon Musk confirmed amuch-publicised promiseto build it within 100 days, or do it for free. The 100MW (megawatt) / 129MWh (megawatt hour) battery should be ready in 2017. ""There is certainly some risk, because this will be largest battery installation in the world by a significant margin,"" Mr Musk said in Adelaide on Friday. He added that ""the next biggest battery in the world is 30 megawatts"". The Tesla-built battery, paired with a Neoen wind farm, will operate around the clock and be capable of providing additional power during emergencies, the government said. ""It will completely transform the way in which renewable energy is stored, and also stabilise the South Australian network as well as putting downward pressure on prices,"" Mr Weatherill said. Mr Musk's 100-day pledge will begin once an electricity grid interconnection agreement has been signed. Tesla has been expanding its battery business alongside its car production. Musk: I can solve Australia power crisis The freak storm that took out a state South Australia has suffered from blackouts since September last year, leading to a political spat over energy policy. The row culminated in abizarre confrontationbetween Mr Weatherill and a federal government minister at a press conference in March.

"Janice Farman had been in Mauritius since 2004 A 47-year-old woman from Clydebank has died in Mauritius after being killed in front of her child during a robbery by masked men at her home. Janice Farman, who lived with her 10-year-old autistic son, died of asphyxiation during Friday's attack. She had been in the Indian Ocean country since 2004 and was working as a director of a data services group. Police believe Mrs Farman was killed during a robbery by three men. One man has been arrested, local media said. The BBC's World Service correspondent in Mauritius, Yasine Mohabuth, said she had recently moved to Albion, in the west of the island, an area previously known for burglaries. He said: ""A fight took place between the three robbers and the victim in the presence of her 10-year-old son. ""Police said that she was smothered to death in her bed. ""They had arrived at three in the morning. It was her son that alerted a friend. The burglars stole many things, including her jewellery and her car. ""Her son is now under the care of the child development unit because his father is abroad."" Mrs Farman's Nissan Tiida was later found by police at the side of the road A post-mortem examination has since confirmed that Mrs Farman died as a result of asphyxiation caused by compression of the neck. Mrs Farman's Nissan Tiida was later found by police at the side of the road. She was originally from Clydebank in West Dunbartonshire and was working as the managing director of PECS (Mauritius) Ltd, a privately owned group of companies providing data services. A colleague said that he had been contacted by her son in the early hours of Friday, who had told him that his mother was ""not breathing"". In a post on social media, he wrote: ""Just imagine.... He clearly had no idea what was going on and he was simply in a state of shock. We called the police and it was later confirmed she did not make it."" He referred to Mrs Farman as his mentor and claimed that ""Mauritius was no longer a paradise."" In a statement from Mrs Farman's employer, Stephen Littlechild from PECS data services, said: ""Last night our MD in Mauritius Janice Farman was brutally murdered in her own home. ""In view of these tragic events, we have decided to close our Mauritius office today, so we can make sure all our team have access to counsellors and as a mark of respect to a wonderful lady. ""Our thoughts are with Janice's family, friends and colleagues."" The British Foreign Office said it was in contact with local authorities in Mauritius about the case.

"Charlie Gard has been in intensive care since October The mother of terminally-ill Charlie Gard has said he is not in ""pain and suffering"". It comes after a US hospital offered to ship an experimental drug to the UK to help treat him. It also offered to admit the 11-month-old if ""legal hurdles"" can be cleared. Great Ormond Street hospital has said further treatment will not help. Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson has saidit would be impossible for Charlie to be transferred to another hospital. Charlie's mother Connie Yates told Good Morning Britain on Friday: ""We are not bad parents, we are there for him all the time, we are completely devoted to him and he's not in pain and suffering, and I promise everyone I would not sit there and watch my son in pain and suffering, I couldn't do it."" Connie Yates and Chris Gard raised more than Â£1.3m for experimental treatment for Charlie Ms Yates said the Pope's intervention earlier this week came after she wrote a letter to him. She said: ""It does give us a hope definitely, because there was no hope left. Charlie was going to die on Friday and, you saw the video we did, we were absolutely devastated. ""We had no control over it, the way it was done. ""And then it was going to be on the Monday instead but I think the White House got involved over the weekend and then that changed things."" Charlie has mitochondrial depletion syndrome, a rare genetic condition which causes progressive muscle weakness. Doctors have said he cannot see, hear, move, cry or swallow and that his life support should be switched off because there is no chance of his condition improving. Charlie's parents, Ms Yates and Chris Gard, raised Â£1.3m on a crowdfunding site to pay for experimental nucleoside therapy in the US. But they lost a legal battle with the hospital last month after judges at the European Court of Human Rights ruled further treatment would ""continue to cause Charlie significant harm"". The US hospital, which cannot be named for legal reasons, said that it would treat the boy with an experimental drug pending approval from government regulators, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). It said it had ""agreed to admit and evaluate Charlie, provided that arrangements are made to safely transfer him to our facility, legal hurdles are cleared, and we receive emergency approval from the FDA for an experimental treatment as appropriate"". It added: ""Alternatively, if approved by the FDA, we will arrange shipment of the experimental drug to Great Ormond Street Hospital and advise their medical staff on administering it if they are willing to do so."" A US specialist told judges that a ""small chance"" of a meaningful improvement in Charlie's brain function would be provided by therapy. Charlie's parents, from Bedfont, west London, have spent the last days of their son's life with him, after being given more time before his life-support is turned off. Last week they said the hospital had denied them their final wish to take their son home to die.

"This video can not be played ""You don't respect me"": Footage from the meeting shows Sir Martin Moore-Bick defending his position The retired judge who will head the inquiry into the Grenfell Tower block fire has faced angry residents and survivors in a three-hour long meeting. A video of the meeting shows Sir Martin Moore-Bick saying he would ""find the facts as I see them from the evidence"". Joe Delaney, of the Grenfell Action Group, told the BBC that Sir Martin was not jeered or booed, but people were sceptical about him. He has already faced calls to step down just days after being appointed. Sir Martin said he had been invited to the meeting on Thursday by the Lancaster West Residents Association. He described it afterwards as a ""very useful meeting"". Where have cladding fire tests failed? Reality Check: The Grenfell rehousing promise 'Amnesty' for Grenfell fire residents Profile: Sir Martin Moore-Bick Mr Delaney told BBC Radio 5 live that Sir Martin: ""You could hear people sighing and tutting."" ""It got a bit loud before the end. I have heard public speakers who can shut up a stadium full of thousands of people. This man couldn't hold a room with 200 or so people."" Local resident Melvyn Akins, 30, said there had been ""frustration, anger and confusion"" in the meeting. ""People firmly believe that arrests should be made as a result of the outcome of all of this. If arrests are not made, people are going to feel justice may not be being done."" Melvyn Akins says local residents want to see people arrested A short video of Sir Martin, recorded at the meeting, shows him telling those present: ""I can't do more than assure you that I know what it is to be impartial. ""I've been a judge for 20 years, and I give you my word that I will look into this matter to the very best of my ability and find the facts as I see them from the evidence. ""That's my job, that's my training, and that's what I intend to do. Now if I can't satisfy you because you have some preconception about me as a person, that's up to you."" A consultation with residents to help define the scope of the inquiry into the 14 June fire in west London, in which at least 80 died, is due to end next Friday. Some survivors are calling for a delay of up to six weeks so they can seek legal advice. However, government officials said Sir Martin was not currently ""minded"" to extend the consultation period. Sir Martin has previously faced calls to step down as head of the Grenfell Tower Inquiry Kensington's Labour MP Emma Dent Coad has described Sir Martin as ""a technocrat"" who lacked ""credibility"" with victims and should step down. But Prime Minister Theresa May said she believed it was ""important"" that the inquiry was ""judge-led"", and said it would ""address the issues that the residents and victims of this terrible fire want to see addressed"". Grenfell Tower inquiry 'will be broad' Will a public inquiry deliver answers? Why is it taking so long to rehouse survivors? Labour councillor Robert Atkinson, of Kensington and Chelsea Council, called on Sir Martin to publish regular updates to residents to take them through the inquiry. ""The judge has got to learn to take heckling from upset people,"" he said. ""I don't think judges are used to being shouted at - and the residents have got to understand that there are constraints on the timing on what the judiciary can do. ""Let's judge the judge by what he does in the next few weeks."" Meanwhile, a team of outside consultants has confirmed to the Victoria Derbyshire programme that it was employed as the clerk of works to carry out checks on Grenfell Tower as recently as July last year. The company, John Rowan and Partners, received four payments totalling more than Â£17,000 to carry out mechanical and engineering inspections and checks on the fabric - or material used - on the building, between March and July 2016. According to documents filed with Kensington and Chelsea Council, seen by the programme, the firm acted in a site-monitoring and supervision role on the project for at least 26 days last year. It is understood the work, which started in January 2015, included making visual inspections, attending meetings and compiling a list of minor defects for the contractor, Rydon, to rectify. John Rowan and Partners said in a statement that it had been deeply shocked by the fire, adding: ""We provided a site-monitoring role during the refurbishment work that completed in 2016. ""The scope for this work included making visual inspections, attending meetings as required by the client and the snagging of works after the contractor has informed that works have been snagged by them."" Separately, cladding samples which failed safety tests in the wake of the fire will be subjected to further ""large-scale"" testing - including building a 30ft-high (9m) demonstration wall to subject the material to a ""severe fire"". Urgent tests were ordered on cladding from about 600 towers blocks in England after the blaze, but after 190 samples out of 191 failed, more tests were requested. Elsewhere, Minister for London Greg Hands has called on Mayor Sadiq Khan to consider moving the Notting Hill Carnival following the fire. Mr Handstweeted,externala letter, in which he wrote: ""The carnival is an important and symbolic community celebration in our capital's calendar... clearly it must go ahead. ""However, we have to ask ourselves if it is appropriate to stage a carnival in the near proximity of a national disaster.""

"Oral sex is producing dangerous gonorrhoea and a decline in condom use is helping it to spread, the World Health Organization has said. It warns that if someone contracts gonorrhoea, it is now much harder to treat, and in some cases impossible. The sexually transmitted infection is rapidly developing resistance to antibiotics. Experts said the situation was ""fairly grim"" with few new drugs on the horizon. About 78 million people pick up the STI each year and it can cause infertility. The World Health Organization analysed data from 77 countries which showed gonorrhoea's resistance to antibiotics was widespread. Dr Teodora Wi, from the WHO, said there had even been three cases - in Japan, France and Spain - where the infection was completely untreatable. She said: ""Gonorrhoea is a very smart bug, every time you introduce a new class of antibiotics to treat gonorrhoea, the bug becomes resistant."" Worryingly, the vast majority of gonorrhoea infections are in poor countries where resistance is harder to detect. ""These cases may just be the tip of the iceberg,"" she added. Gonorrhoea can infect the genitals, rectum and throat, but it is the last that is most concerning health officials. Dr Wi said antibiotics could lead to bacteria in the back of the throat, including relatives of gonorrhoea, developing resistance. She said: ""When you use antibiotics to treat infections like a normal sore throat, this mixes with theNeisseriaspecies in your throat and this results in resistance."" Thrusting gonorrhoea bacteria into this environment through oral sex can lead to super-gonorrhoea. ""In the US, resistance [to an antibiotic] came from men having sex with men because of pharyngeal infection,"" she added. A decline in condom use, which had soared because of fears of HIV/Aids, is thought to help the infection spread. The disease is caused by the bacterium calledNeisseria gonorrhoea. The infection is spread by unprotected vaginal, oral and anal sex. Symptoms can include a thick green or yellow discharge from sexual organs, pain when urinating and bleeding between periods. However, of those infected, about one in 10 heterosexual men and more than three-quarters of women, and gay men, have no easily recognisable symptoms. Untreated infection can lead to infertility, pelvic inflammatory disease and can be passed on to a child during pregnancy. The World Health Organization is calling on countries to monitor the spread of resistant gonorrhoea and to invest in new drugs. BBC Radio 1 - Myth-busting STIs Pubic hair grooming 'STI risk from cuts' Dr Manica Balasegaram, from the Global Antibiotic Research and Development Partnership, said: ""The situation is fairly grim. ""There are only three drug candidates in the entire drug [development] pipeline and no guarantee any will make it out."" But ultimately, the WHO said vaccines would be needed to stop gonorrhoea. Prof Richard Stabler, from the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, said: ""Ever since the introduction of penicillin, hailed as a reliable and quick cure, gonorrhoea has developed resistance to all therapeutic antibiotics. ""In the past 15 years therapy has had to change three times following increasing rates of resistance worldwide. ""We are now at a point where we are using the drugs of last resort, but there are worrying signs as treatment failure due to resistant strains has been documented."" Follow Jameson Twitter,external. It's hard to say if more people around the world are having more oral sex than they used to, as there isn't much reliable global data available. Data from the UK and US show it's very common, and has been for years, including among teenagers. The UK's first National Survey of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles, carried out in 1990-1991, found 69.7% of men and 65.6% of women had given oral sex to, or received it from, a partner of the opposite sex in the previous year. By the time of the second survey during 1999-2001, this had increased to 77.9% for men and 76.8% for women, but hasn't changed much since. A national survey in the US, meanwhile, has found about two-thirds of 15-24 year olds have ever had oral sex. Dr Mark Lawton from the British Association for Sexual Health and HIV said people with gonorrhoea in the throat would be unlikely to realise it and thus be more likely to pass it on via oral sex. He recognises that while condoms would reduce the risk of transmission, many people wouldn't want to use them. ""My message would be to get tested so at least if you've got it you know about it,"" Dr Lawton said.

"Converting and downloading YouTube videos is a violation of the site's terms and conditions Stream-ripping is now the fastest-growing form of music piracy in the UK, new research has suggested. Several sites and apps allow users to turn Spotify songs, YouTube videos and other streaming content into permanent files to store on phones and computers. Record labels claim that ""tens, or even hundreds of millions of tracks are illegally copied and distributed by stream-ripping services each month"". One service alone is thought to have more than 60 million monthly users. According to research by theIntellectual Property Office,externalandPRS For Music,external, 15% of adults in the UK regularly use these services, with 33% of them coming from the 16-24 age bracket. Overall usage of stream-ripping sites increased by 141.3% between 2014 and 2016, overshadowing all other illegal music services. In September last year, these sites were used 498,681 times to pirate music in the UK. By comparison, file-sharing service BitTorrent was used 23,567 times; and Cyberlocker sites like Dropbox and Rapidshare were accessed 104,898 times. ""As soon as we think we've come up with an innovative solution [to piracy], the pirates seem to come up with an even more innovative infringement tactic,"" said Pippa Hall, Chief Economist at the IPO. Reasons given for stream-ripping included: Music was already owned by the user in another format (31% of users) Wanting to listen to music offline (26%) Wanting to listen to music on the move (25%) Cannot afford to pay for music (21%) The feeling that official music content is overpriced (20%) (These figures add up to more than 100%, as people were allowed to choose more than one response) A quarter of the people who use stream-ripping believed the sites had the necessary rights and permissions to allow them to download and rip content; and one in five said they felt they were not doing anything illegal. Only 56% per cent of consumers said they felt confident in identifying illegal content online, the IPO said. Robert Ashcroft, chief executive ofPRS for Music,external, said: ""We hope that this research will provide the basis for a renewed and refocused commitment to tackling online copyright infringement. ""The long-term health of the UK's cultural and creative sectors is in everyone's best interests, including those of the digital service providers, and a co-ordinated industry and government approach to tackling stream-ripping is essential."" There was some good news for the music industry in the IPO's research, however. It found that the average consumer spent Â£75 on music last year, up from Â£68 in 2016.

"This video can not be played What does body language tell us about the Trump-Putin G20 meeting? Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin have held their first face-to-face talks, on the sidelines of the G20 summit in the German city of Hamburg. ""It's an honour to be with you,"" Mr Trump told Mr Putin, who responded: ""I'm delighted to meet you personally."" Both sides listed a wide range of topics discussed, including Russia's alleged meddling in the US election. Climate change and trade are set to dominate the two-day G20 meeting. Violent clashes between protesters and police have taken place in the streets outside the venue, with dozens left injured. A huge police operation is trying to keep demonstrators - who are protesting against the presence of Mr Trump and Mr Putin, climate change and global wealth inequalities - well away from the summit venue, and water cannon have been deployed. Earlier, US First Lady Melania Trump was unable to leave her hotel in Hamburg because of the protests. Trump and Putin shake hands - filmed by the German government Donald and Vladimir: How do they compare? Who are the G20 protesters? ""Putin and I have been discussing various things, and I think it's going very well,"" Mr Trump told reporters while sitting alongside Mr Putin at the start of the talks, which were open to the media. ""We've had some very, very good talks. We're going to have a talk now and obviously that will continue. We look forward to a lot of very positive things happening for Russia, for the United States and for everybody concerned."" Mr Putin, via a translator, said that while they had spoken by phone, a phone conversation was never as good as meeting face to face. Both men ignored shouted questions from reporters as the meeting went into private session. This video can not be played Police and anti-summit protesters clashed for a second day Speaking afterwards, Mr Putin said: ""I've had a very long conversation with the US president. We had a lot of issues to discuss, including Ukraine, Syria, and other problems, also some bilateral issues. ""We have again returned to the fight against terror and to cyber security."" Secretary of State Rex Tillerson largely confirmed these were the topics covered, saying the leaders connected quickly and had positive chemistry. But the two sides seem unable to agree on the exact outcome of talks over the Russian hacking allegations. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Mr Trump accepted Mr Putin's assertions that they were not true. Mr Tillerson, meanwhile, said the two men had had a ""robust"" discussion on the issue during the two hour and 15 minute meeting, and that Mr Trump had pressed the Russian leader on several occasions. However, he said it was not clear whether the two countries would ever come to an agreement on what happened. ""I think the president is rightly focused on how do we move forward from something that may be an intractable disagreement at this point,"" Mr Tillerson said, according to theAssociated Press news agency,external. Mr Tillerson also said they had discussed Syria and its future, and shared ""commonalities on what outcome should be"", although they had different ideas on how to get there. They have, however, agreed to declare a ceasefire in south-west Syria from Sunday, Mr Lavrov said. Earlier, a brief videoclip posted on the German government's Facebook page,externalshowed Mr Trump and Mr Putin meeting for the first time and shaking hands, with Mr Trump patting Mr Putin's arm as they smiled in the company of other leaders. The words were warm enough, but the body language was restrained as this meeting began. Neither man was smiling much as both said they hoped for positive results from their encounter. Their handshake, when it finally came, was brief and businesslike. But they clearly had plenty to talk about, as their meeting went on well over the time allocated. Russia sees that alone as a success, proof that Vladimir Putin is a global leader to be reckoned with. No-one here is expecting any big deals though, like lifting sanctions for example. The Kremlin has stressed all along that its main aim is to establish a ""working dialogue"" with Donald Trump, and perhaps begin the slow process of restoring relations with the US, which are at their lowest point in many years. The two men staked out opposing views on major international issues in the run-up to the summit: On Thursday, Mr Trump used a speech in the Polish capital Warsawto call on Russia to stop ""destabilising"" Ukraineand other countries, and ""join the community of responsible nations"" Setting out his own G20 agenda in German financial newspaper Handelsblatt, Mr Putin called for US-led sanctions on his country, imposed in response to Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014, to be lifted Mr Putin also argued strongly in favour of the Paris climate agreement, saying it was a ""secure basis for long-term climate regulation"" and Russia wanted to make a ""comprehensive contribution to its implementation"" President Trump has taken the US out of the Paris agreement This video can not be played Mr Trump was once popular in Russia, but opinion there has turned against him since he came into office The G20 (Group of Twenty) is a summit for 19 countries, both developed and developing, plus the EU.

Mrs Merkel has said the G20 willfocus on the Paris climate dealbut, as the G20 host, she will work to find compromises.

"Charlie Gard has been in intensive care since October The mother of terminally-ill Charlie Gard has said he is not in ""pain and suffering"". It comes after a US hospital offered to ship an experimental drug to the UK to help treat him. It also offered to admit the 11-month-old if ""legal hurdles"" can be cleared. Great Ormond Street hospital has said further treatment will not help. Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson has saidit would be impossible for Charlie to be transferred to another hospital. Charlie's mother Connie Yates told Good Morning Britain on Friday: ""We are not bad parents, we are there for him all the time, we are completely devoted to him and he's not in pain and suffering, and I promise everyone I would not sit there and watch my son in pain and suffering, I couldn't do it."" Connie Yates and Chris Gard raised more than Â£1.3m for experimental treatment for Charlie Ms Yates said the Pope's intervention earlier this week came after she wrote a letter to him. She said: ""It does give us a hope definitely, because there was no hope left. Charlie was going to die on Friday and, you saw the video we did, we were absolutely devastated. ""We had no control over it, the way it was done. ""And then it was going to be on the Monday instead but I think the White House got involved over the weekend and then that changed things."" Charlie has mitochondrial depletion syndrome, a rare genetic condition which causes progressive muscle weakness. Doctors have said he cannot see, hear, move, cry or swallow and that his life support should be switched off because there is no chance of his condition improving. Charlie's parents, Ms Yates and Chris Gard, raised Â£1.3m on a crowdfunding site to pay for experimental nucleoside therapy in the US. But they lost a legal battle with the hospital last month after judges at the European Court of Human Rights ruled further treatment would ""continue to cause Charlie significant harm"". The US hospital, which cannot be named for legal reasons, said that it would treat the boy with an experimental drug pending approval from government regulators, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). It said it had ""agreed to admit and evaluate Charlie, provided that arrangements are made to safely transfer him to our facility, legal hurdles are cleared, and we receive emergency approval from the FDA for an experimental treatment as appropriate"". It added: ""Alternatively, if approved by the FDA, we will arrange shipment of the experimental drug to Great Ormond Street Hospital and advise their medical staff on administering it if they are willing to do so."" A US specialist told judges that a ""small chance"" of a meaningful improvement in Charlie's brain function would be provided by therapy. Charlie's parents, from Bedfont, west London, have spent the last days of their son's life with him, after being given more time before his life-support is turned off. Last week they said the hospital had denied them their final wish to take their son home to die.

"Thousands of people could be let down by poor funeral plans they don't understand, a new report has claimed. Consumer group Fairer Finance said people who paid for their funerals in advance could find their relatives faced extra costs after they died. It also accused the industry of high-pressure sales tactics with vulnerable consumers, and claimed there was a danger of some firms collapsing. The funeral industry itself said it was already campaigning for change. The Fairer Finance study called for proper regulation of funeral plans, suggesting that the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) should play a role. The report,externalwas commissioned by Dignity, one of the biggest providers. It said the scale of unscrupulous sales practices in the market was significant and growing. However it also says that buying a funeral plan from a reputable provider can provide good value for money, as it locks in current prices. The average cost of a pre-paid funeral plan is about Â£4,000, according to the report. But many plans do not cover costs such as embalming, limousines, a funeral service, a wake, burial plots or memorial stones. In some cases, families are left having to find an extra Â£2,000, even though they expect such items to be included. Many customers buying such plans are elderly or vulnerable, and will not be around to check whether the product met their expectations, Fairer Finance said. As many as 1.2 million people in the UK have pre-payment plans, and the industry is growing fast - up by 350% over the last 10 years. Sales representatives have targeted at least six million adults over the age of 50, using what the report describes as ""high-pressure"" techniques. Some people have been subject to aggressive telephone marketing or in-home visits, it claimed. In a telephone survey, nearly half of those contacted by sales reps said they felt as if they had been ""pushed"" to buy a plan. In some instances, funeral plan firms pay commissions and fees of up to Â£1,000 for each policy sold - around a quarter of the total plan cost. The report also said there was very little transparency over what happens to clients' money after they had paid it. The National Association of Funeral Directors (NAFD) said it had been campaigning for tighter rules since November last year. ""In our view, the current lack of comprehensive oversight is allowing sharp sales practices and a lack of transparency to flourish in parts of the market,"" said Alison Crake, president of the NAFD. ""Members have reported numerous instances to us where funeral plan providers have not acted in the best interests of either the public who have paid for funeral plans, or the funeral directors who will care for them."" Tips for buying a funeral plan The industry is currently subject only to voluntary regulation, by the Funeral Planning Authority (FPA), and there is no ombudsman service for consumers to complain to. However, the report argues that funeral plans are financial products and should therefore be regulated by the FCA.

"This video can not be played ""You don't respect me"": Footage from the meeting shows Sir Martin Moore-Bick defending his position The retired judge who will head the inquiry into the Grenfell Tower block fire has faced angry residents and survivors in a three-hour long meeting. A video of the meeting shows Sir Martin Moore-Bick saying he would ""find the facts as I see them from the evidence"". Joe Delaney, of the Grenfell Action Group, told the BBC that Sir Martin was not jeered or booed, but people were sceptical about him. He has already faced calls to step down just days after being appointed. Sir Martin said he had been invited to the meeting on Thursday by the Lancaster West Residents Association. He described it afterwards as a ""very useful meeting"". Where have cladding fire tests failed? Reality Check: The Grenfell rehousing promise 'Amnesty' for Grenfell fire residents Profile: Sir Martin Moore-Bick Mr Delaney told BBC Radio 5 live that Sir Martin: ""You could hear people sighing and tutting."" ""It got a bit loud before the end. I have heard public speakers who can shut up a stadium full of thousands of people. This man couldn't hold a room with 200 or so people."" Local resident Melvyn Akins, 30, said there had been ""frustration, anger and confusion"" in the meeting. ""People firmly believe that arrests should be made as a result of the outcome of all of this. If arrests are not made, people are going to feel justice may not be being done."" Melvyn Akins says local residents want to see people arrested A short video of Sir Martin, recorded at the meeting, shows him telling those present: ""I can't do more than assure you that I know what it is to be impartial. ""I've been a judge for 20 years, and I give you my word that I will look into this matter to the very best of my ability and find the facts as I see them from the evidence. ""That's my job, that's my training, and that's what I intend to do. Now if I can't satisfy you because you have some preconception about me as a person, that's up to you."" A consultation with residents to help define the scope of the inquiry into the 14 June fire in west London, in which at least 80 died, is due to end next Friday. Some survivors are calling for a delay of up to six weeks so they can seek legal advice. However, government officials said Sir Martin was not currently ""minded"" to extend the consultation period. Sir Martin has previously faced calls to step down as head of the Grenfell Tower Inquiry Kensington's Labour MP Emma Dent Coad has described Sir Martin as ""a technocrat"" who lacked ""credibility"" with victims and should step down. But Prime Minister Theresa May said she believed it was ""important"" that the inquiry was ""judge-led"", and said it would ""address the issues that the residents and victims of this terrible fire want to see addressed"". Grenfell Tower inquiry 'will be broad' Will a public inquiry deliver answers? Why is it taking so long to rehouse survivors? Labour councillor Robert Atkinson, of Kensington and Chelsea Council, called on Sir Martin to publish regular updates to residents to take them through the inquiry. ""The judge has got to learn to take heckling from upset people,"" he said. ""I don't think judges are used to being shouted at - and the residents have got to understand that there are constraints on the timing on what the judiciary can do. ""Let's judge the judge by what he does in the next few weeks."" Meanwhile, a team of outside consultants has confirmed to the Victoria Derbyshire programme that it was employed as the clerk of works to carry out checks on Grenfell Tower as recently as July last year. The company, John Rowan and Partners, received four payments totalling more than Â£17,000 to carry out mechanical and engineering inspections and checks on the fabric - or material used - on the building, between March and July 2016. According to documents filed with Kensington and Chelsea Council, seen by the programme, the firm acted in a site-monitoring and supervision role on the project for at least 26 days last year. It is understood the work, which started in January 2015, included making visual inspections, attending meetings and compiling a list of minor defects for the contractor, Rydon, to rectify. John Rowan and Partners said in a statement that it had been deeply shocked by the fire, adding: ""We provided a site-monitoring role during the refurbishment work that completed in 2016. ""The scope for this work included making visual inspections, attending meetings as required by the client and the snagging of works after the contractor has informed that works have been snagged by them."" Separately, cladding samples which failed safety tests in the wake of the fire will be subjected to further ""large-scale"" testing - including building a 30ft-high (9m) demonstration wall to subject the material to a ""severe fire"". Urgent tests were ordered on cladding from about 600 towers blocks in England after the blaze, but after 190 samples out of 191 failed, more tests were requested. Elsewhere, Minister for London Greg Hands has called on Mayor Sadiq Khan to consider moving the Notting Hill Carnival following the fire. Mr Handstweeted,externala letter, in which he wrote: ""The carnival is an important and symbolic community celebration in our capital's calendar... clearly it must go ahead. ""However, we have to ask ourselves if it is appropriate to stage a carnival in the near proximity of a national disaster.""

"Riot police entered the prison after the deadly fight A fight between rival gangs in a prison in south-western Mexico has left at least 28 inmates dead, officials say. The pre-dawn fight broke out in the maximum security wing of Las Cruces prison in the city of Acapulco. The victims were stabbed and beaten to death, with some decapitated. The governor has ordered an investigation. Acapulco is the largest city in Guerrero state, one of Mexico's most violent areas and a big centre for drug production. Bodies were discovered throughout the unit, including inside the kitchen and in an area for conjugal visits, said Roberto Ãlvarez, a state security spokesman. There were no signs that weapons were used, he added. The investigation would also focus on the prison staff. ""The incident was triggered by a permanent feud between rival groups within the prison,"" he said. A guide to Mexico's drug cartels Mexico, one of the most dangerous countries for reporters Federal police and the army set up a security cordon outside the Las Cruces prison, which is reportedly overcrowded, with more than 2,000 inmates. Acapulco used to be one of Mexico's most popular tourist spots, but has seen a rise in violence as criminal gangs fight for control over illegal activities. It has become one of the country's deadliest cities. Inmates' relatives tore down a security fence of the prison after hearing news of the deadly fight This is the latest in a series of violent incidents across Mexico this year. May was the deadliest month in the country since 1997, when official statistics began, with 2,186 homicides.
