"This video can not be played ""We must stop Brexit"", Jo Swinson says Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson has warned Boris Johnson that ""if he thinks being a woman is somehow a weakness, he's about to find out it is not"". She said the PM's choice of insults such as ""big girl's blouse"" and ""girly swot"" were ""revealing"". In her first conference speech as leader, she said she could not wait to ""take on"" Mr Johnson, Jeremy Corbyn and Nigel Farage in an election. And she vowed a Lib Dem government would stop Brexit ""on day one"". The Lib Dems currently have 18 MPs - a figure boosted by recent defections - but it would require a seismic shift in the electoral landscape for them to win power. Nevertheless, Ms Swinson received a standing ovation when she told the conference she wanted to be prime minister, adding: ""There is no limit to my ambition for our party."" Mr Johnson called Mr Corbyn ""a big girl's blouse""during their first clash at Prime Minister's Questions earlier this month - a remark that prompted some criticism. It also emerged he had labelled former PM David Cameron a ""girly swot"". On Tuesday, as the Supreme Court began hearing two appeals relating to the suspension of Parliament, Lib Dem conference delegates backed an emergency motion calling forthe suspension of Parliamentto be reversed. Earlier at the conferencethey voted overwhelmingly to back her proposalfor a manifesto pledge to revoke Article 50 if the party came into power with a majority government. Five things from the Lib Dem conference Swinson rejects propping up Johnson or Corbyn Who is new Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson? EU has had 'bellyful' of Brexit process - Johnson In her speech, Ms Swinson criticised Mr Johnson's pledge to take the UK out of the EU by 31 October, with or without a deal. She told the conference in Bournemouth the prime minister's spending on no-deal preparations was ""sickening"". ""The truth is you can't plan for no deal. Planning for no deal is like planning to burn your house down,"" she said. ""You might have insurance, but you're still going to lose all your stuff."" The six new Lib Dems - acquired from Labour and the Tories - were front and centre Ask Liberal Democrat members here what they think of their leader and words like ""refreshing"", ""energetic"" and ""relatable"" trip off the tongue. Some praise Jo Swinson's ability to communicate with voters, others gush about her confidence and composure in the House of Commons. But old hands who've seen leaders come and go sound a note of caution about fulfilling expectations. One senior figure said she needed to ""rise to the occasion"". Jo Swinson has won her party's backing for a bold shift in policy on Brexit, and talks of winning 300 seats in a general election. But with big ambitions come big expectations and soon Jo Swinson will be judged by her party on what she can deliver not just on what she can promise. Ms Swinson, whosucceeded Sir Vince Cable as Lib Dem leader in July,added: ""The first task is clear. We must stop Brexit. There is no Brexit that will be good for our country."" She criticised Mr Johnson for withdrawing the Conservative whip from 21 Tory rebels - including one,Sam Gyimah, who later joined the Lib Dems- and for deciding to suspend Parliament. She said he was ""silencing critics, purging opponents, ignoring the law"". ""For someone who proclaims to hate socialist dictators, he's doing a pretty good impression of one."" This video can not be played Jo Swinson criticises Corbyn and Johnson Ms Swinson also turned her fire on Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, accusing him of holding on to Eurosceptic views. ""Even now, when faced with all the clear and obvious dangers that Brexit brings, Jeremy Corbyn still insists that if Labour win a general election, they will negotiate their own Brexit deal to take us out of the EU,"" she said. ""Nigel Farage might be Brexit by name, but it is very clear that Jeremy Corbyn is Brexit by nature."" Earlier, shadow attorney general Shami Chakrabarti described the Lib Dem's promise to revoke Article 50 without a further referendum as ""illiberal and anti-democratic"". Turning to Scotland, Ms Swinson highlighted its support to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum and urged supporters there to give ""a big vote"" to her party. ""Together we can stop Brexit,"" she said. ""We are building a movement across the United Kingdom that is on the verge of stopping it."" In her keynote speech, Ms Swinson also touched on policy matters away from Brexit. On climate change, she said a Lib Dem government would create a green investment bank and set up a citizens' assembly to debate how the UK would reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2045. She said her government would tackle climate change ""because, as the placards say, there is no Planet B."" Ms Swinson also said she wanted the party to ""fundamentally rethink the purpose of our economy"", asking why a country's success was ""reduced to a GDP figure"". ""It [GDP] measures everything in short, except that which makes life worthwhile,"" she said quoting the American politician Bobby Kennedy. She pledged to introduce a wellbeing budget ""to spell out our priorities for public spending on the things that matter most"". The Lib Dem leader also promised to fund youth services in order to tackle knife crime and to ringfence funding for mental health services.

"The international trade secretary has written to the Commons committee on armed exports controls The UK's international trade secretary has apologised to a court for two breaches of a pledge not to licence exports to Saudi Arabia that could be used in the Yemen conflict. Ministers promised to stop approving shipments in June after a challenge by campaigners at the Court of Appeal. Liz Truss said the granting of licences for Â£435,000 of radio spares and a Â£200 air cooler for the Royal Saudi Land Forces had been ""inadvertent"". An internal inquiry is taking place. In aletter to the Commons Committees on Arms Export Controls,,externalMs Truss said routine analysis of statistics found a licence for the air cooler for a Renault Sherpa Light Scout vehicle had been issued just days after the ruling. And a licence for the export of 260 items of radio spares had been issued in July. To date, the letter said, 180 items from that order - with a value of Â£261,450 - had been shipped. Ms Truss said: ""I have apologised to the court unreservedly for the error in granting these two licences."" Government lawyers had informed the court of the ""breaches of the undertaking given"", she added. She said the internal investigation had been launched to establish whether other licences had been issued against the assurances to the court or Parliament, and to ensure there could be no further breaches. Yemen has been locked in civil war since 2015 The court case saw theCampaign Against Arms Trade arguethat the UK decision to continue to license military equipment for export to the Gulf state was unlawful. Under UK export policy, military equipment licences should not be granted if there is a ""clear risk"" that weapons might be used in a ""serious violation of international humanitarian law"". Judges hearing the court case decided existing licences should be reviewed but they would not be immediately suspended. But Ms Truss's predecessor Liam Fox had given an assurance that the government would not grant further export licences while it considered the ruling. Responding to the government's apology, the campaign's Andrew Smith said: ""We are always being told how rigorous and robust UK arms export controls supposedly are, but this shows that nothing could be further from the truth.""

"This video can not be played ""I will obey the law"" The BBC's Laura Kuenssberg sat down for an interview with Prime Minister Boris Johnson after his meeting with the European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker. Here is the full transcript of what they said. Laura Kuenssberg:You've just been with [European Commission president] Jean-Claude Juncker. Do you feel you've made any progress since seeing him. I mean he could be the deal maker? Boris Johnson:Yes. I mean obviously I've talked to him several times since becoming prime minister, but he's... I've known Jean-Claude for many, many years and he is a very, highly, highly intelligent guy and I think that he would like to get a deal if we possibly can, but clearly it's going to take some work. We think that there are, we can satisfy the European Commission and our friends on the key points. Can we protect the single market the integrity the single market? Can we ensure there's no checks at the border in Northern Ireland? Can we protect all the achievements of the Good Friday Agreement and peace in Northern Ireland? Yes I think we can, while simultaneously allowing the whole of the UK to withdraw. It will now take an accelerated timetable of work to, to get that done. And it maybe - you know - just have to say that it may be that we have to come out without an agreement if necessary on 31 October. LK:And we will come to that in a second. But just in the last few minutes, the [European] Commission has put a statement out, saying after your lunch that they still are yet to see proposals that they think are viable and workable. So it doesn't feel like this is going anywhere at the moment? BJ:Well, it's certainly the case that the Commission is still officially sticking on their position that the backstop has got to be there. But clearly if they think that we can come up with alternatives, then I think they're on the mark. I think the big picture is that the Commission would like to do a deal. [Pause to adjust the microphone] LK:I mean the Commission has immediately after your lunch put out a statement saying they still haven't seen viable workable proposals. Do you feel they're listening or is this that they're saying something else behind closed doors to what they say publicly? BJ:No, I think the Commission, I think Jean-Claude himself certainly would like to do a deal and would like the UK to, and would like to settle this if he possibly can. They have their own constraints. They've got the European Parliament they've got to deal with. I think there's a deal there to be done and of the kind that I've described. But clearly if we can't get movement from them on that crucial issue of whether the EU can continue to control the UK and our trade policy and our regulation - which is how it would work under the current Withdrawal Agreement - we won't be able to get that through the House of Commons, no way. And we'll have an exit with no-deal on 31 October. That's not what I want. It's not what they want. And we're going to work very hard to avoid it. But, but that's the reality. LK:But what is the broad shape of a deal that you think is there? I mean we've heard many times from you and ministers that there is a landing zone. As simply as you can, what is the nature of the deal you think you can get? BJ:I mean, I think that the important thing here is not to be... I mean, there is a negotiation going on, has been for a long time now about how to do this. So there's a limit to how much the details benefit from publicity before we've actually done the deal. But the shape of it is, the shape it is... LK:Slice and dice the backstop as it exists? BJ:The shape of it is all about who decides. Fundamentally, the problem with the backstop, as you remember, is that it's a device by which the EU can continue after we've left to control our trade laws, control our tariffs, control huge chunks of our regulation, and we have to keep accepting laws from Brussels long after we've left with no say on those laws. Now that just doesn't work. It doesn't work for the whole of the UK and it doesn't work for Northern Ireland. So we have to find a way to avoid that situation. LK:But what is that way? Because what you're saying there is just articulating the problem that's been articulated forever, about the backstop and people's concern that Northern Ireland would still have to and the rest of the UK would have to go along with EU rules. But can you foresee a solution, for example, when in some areas, Northern Ireland would follow EU rules and the rest of the UK would not? BJ:What we want to see is a solution where the decision is taken by the UK and clearly that's the problem with the, with the backstop. It basically leaves the decision making up to Brussels and that's no good. LK:What's the actual solution that you're proposing? Is it giving more power to Stormont, for example, that's being talked about a lot, that the Northern Irish assembly might be given a lock on opting out or opting in on EU regulation? BJ:These are certainly some of the ideas that are being talked about and as are the ideas that you're familiar with to do with maximum facilitations, to do with checks away from the border, all sorts of ways in which you can avoid a hard border in Northern Ireland. This is all doable. It's all doable with energy and goodwill. But I mentioned the other day when I was in in Dublin, you know the famous dictum attributed I think probably incorrectly to Ian Paisley the elder, [in] Northern Ireland the people are British, but the cattle are Irish, you know there's a there's a germ of an idea there. LK:But it's just the germ of an idea... BJ:There's a lot of thinking going on about how to get an agreement that gets the UK out whole and entire, but also protects that Northern Irish border, protects that peace process and protects all the gains that Ireland has got from its membership of the EU single market. So, I'm, you know, I mean, more or less where I was the other day. I'm cautiously optimistic, cautious. But it is vital that we're ready to come out on 31 October. And of course what the... parliamentarians threatening to extend and all that kind of thing. They hear that they listened to that over here, but I didn't think it substantially changes their calculations. LK:MPs though haven't just threatened to extend, MPs have changed the law to try to stop you taking the UK out without a deal at the end of October. How do you propose to get round that? Because you keep saying you've got no intention of delay... BJ:I won't. Here's, here's what I want. I will uphold the constitution, I will obey the law, but we will come out on 31 October. LK:But how if MPs have changed the law to stop you doing that? BJ:We're going to come out on 31 October and it's vital that people understand that the UK will not extend. We won't go on remaining in the EU beyond October. What on earth is the point? Do you know how much it costs? LK:But how will you do that if MPs have changed the law to stop you? Are you looking for a way round the law? Because that's what it sounds like... BJ:We will obey the law but we will come out - and - we will come out I should say on 31 October. LK:But that means you are looking for a way round the law. I mean, to be really clear about this, Parliament has changed the law to make it almost impossible to take us out of the EU without a deal at the end of October. But you say that you will not do it. That means that you must be looking for a way around the law? BJ:Well, you know those are your words. What we're going to do is come out on 31 October deal or no-deal. And staying in beyond 31 October completely... crackers. You're spending Â£1bn a month for the privilege remaining in the... what is the point? The people of this country want us to get on and leave the EU and deliver on the mandate of the people. And staying in costs Â£250m a week, which is which is roughly the same as what it would cost to build a new hospital every week. That's what Jeremy Corbyn and the opposition parties seem to think is a good idea. I don't think it's a good idea. LK:You used to say it cost Â£350m a week, now you're saying Â£250m a week? BJ:I think the priorities of the British people are to come out and that's what we're going to do. LK:But do you really think that you want to be the kind of prime minister that is looking of ways of sneaking around the law to keep to your political promise? I mean, everybody knows how strongly you feel... BJ:These are all your words. LK:But how will you do it then? Will you challenge it in court? Will you take Parliament to court? BJ:Our first priority, if I may say so, just to try and look on the bright side for a second or two, is to come out with a deal and that's what we're working to achieve. And I think we have every prospect of doing that. LK:But if you don't, I mean you are looking, you know the law has been changed to try to make this impossible. If you want to look for a way round it, many people believe that means you must be preparing somehow to ignore the law or to challenge that because it's a new area of law. Would you seek to challenge the law in court? Will the government take Parliament to court? BJ:What we're going to do is work very hard to get a deal that will allow us to come out. I see no point whatever in staying on in the EU beyond 31 October and we're going to come out. And actually that is what our friends and partners in the EU would like too. And I think that they've had a bellyful of all this stuff. You know they want to develop a new relationship with the UK. They're fed up with these endless negotiations, endless delays. They've now delayed twice before to achieve what is completely unclear to me. LK:And you're completely clear that politically the promise you gave to your party was to leave on 31 October. And that was clear as crystal. But since you've been in office you've suspended Parliament. You say you might find a way around the way that Parliament might change the law... BJ:Well, that's what you've just said. LK:Well, you haven't denied it prime minister. I mean it does seem since you've been in office that, some of the things that you have done, you seem to believe the conventions and rules somehow don't apply to you really? BJ:Obviously I humbly, respectfully, disagree. If you're talking about having a Queen's Speech, I think that was the right thing to do. This Parliament has gone on for longer than any time since the Civil War. It's right to have a Queen's Speech, it's right to set out our ambitious agenda for the country. There's all sorts of things we want to do. Whether it's investing in health care and putting police on the streets. We've got a fantastic agenda for investing in science. A huge, huge agenda for this country. On the environment, on housing we have big, big projects. We need a Queen's Speech. And by the way, all this mumbo jumbo about how Parliament is being deprived of the opportunity to scrutinise Brexit. What a load of claptrap. Actually, Parliament I think has lost about four or five days. I don't think Parliament has sat during the period from late September beginning of October for about 120 years. With great respect, I don't think people are aware of that fact. I think people think that we've somehow stopped Parliament from scrutinising Brexit. What absolute nonsense. Parliament will be able to scrutinise the deal that I hope we will be able to do both before and after the European Council on 17 October. LK:But when it comes to sticking to the promise you made to leave on 31 October... BJ:We're going to do that. LK:Is there a line that you would not cross? BJ:Well yes, obviously I didn't want to go beyond 31 October. I think that would be a mistake. LK:In order to stick to that goal, is there anything that you would not do? Would you rule out suspending parliament again? BJ:As I say, we're going to uphold the constitution and we're going to obey the law. And it's very important to realise that actually, I think our friends and partners in the EU are keen to work with us to get a deal. That's what I've been doing here with Jean-Claude Juncker and Michel Barnier. We've been working very hard. We've had a good productive exchange. Has there been a total breakthrough? I wouldn't say so. But I would say that a huge amount of work is now going to be done to sort it out. Am I more optimistic than I was when I, when we took office? This morning? I would say a little bit, but not much, just a little bit. Because I think that there's a, perhaps an even greater willingness on the part of the Commission to engage than I had, than I had thought. So, so yes. I'm cautiously optimistic, but I'm not counting my chickens. And it is absolutely vital, it's absolutely vital for people to understand that the UK is ready to come out with no-deal if we have to. LK:Do you feel that the UK is stable right now? I mean, it looks like chaos, doesn't it? BJ:No, I think it's extremely stable. We've got unemployment at record lows. We have record levels of investment from overseas - one point Â£3tn pounds. There's no other country in Europe that gets these levels of investment. If people genuinely thought, if people genuinely thought that there was some political risk in the UK, would they be investing in this in this country in the way that they are? LK:Does it look politically stable? BJ:This is an immensely, but it is an immensely stable country. We are going through what is, after all, a quite difficult exercise in democracy. Which is, what happened is that the people of this country decided after 45 years of EU membership that that highly intricate relationship was one that they no longer wished to pursue. And that has had a great deal of consequence. The disentangling of that relationship is obviously complex, but it can be done and it is being done. And we will get on with it successfully. And I think people should be very optimistic about the future of this country, because it's a fantastic country. It is the leader and the cutting edge of most of the 21st century technology in Europe.  And a place that attracts, not just huge quantities of inward investment, but the best and brightest from around the world. And what we will, what we will ensure as we become, as we take advantage of Brexit, is that we remain not just open to our friends in the rest of the EU, but we reach out now to the rest of the world and take advantage of the opportunities the Brexit offers. And I think actually what the people of our country want is a little less of this sort of gloom and kind of, you know, I think most people think that, honestly it's just nonsensical to think that democracy in the UK is any way endangered or the UK economy is in any way endangered. We're going through a period of constitutional adjustment caused by the decision of the people to leave the EU. That was always going to be logistically and practically difficult to accomplish. But we're going to do it and we're going it by 31 October, and we will be in very good shape whether we get a deal or not. And if we don't get a deal, I'm still, as I say, cautiously optimistic that we will. If we don't get a deal, we will come out nonetheless LK:One of the people who is extremely gloomy about what's happened is your old friend and rival and colleague David Cameron. Now he says that the Leave campaign that you led lied. He said that you behaved appallingly and he's a prime minister, a Tory prime minister, who left behind a total mess over Europe. Are you worried you might face the same fate? BJ:I have nothing but admiration. Look I don't want to say anything further about David Cameron and his memoirs than what I said the other day, which is I have the highest respect and affection, regard for him. He and I worked together for many years and I think he has a legacy, in terms of turning around the economic chaos that Labour left, helping to introduce a jobs miracle in this country, turning the economy around, I think he can be very very proud of. So that's my view on Dave and what he's got to say. LK:He's been pretty brutal about you... BJ:Well. Really? I mean you know. I think that he has a lot to be proud of and there you go.

"This video can not be played Abqaiq has the world's largest oil processing plant The head of the Nato military alliance has said he is extremely concerned that tensions will escalate after an attack on Saudi oil facilities. Jens Stoltenberg also said Iran was ""destabilising the whole region"". Earlier on Monday, the US released satellite images showing damage from the weekend's ""unprecedented"" strikes, which it has pinned on Iran. Iran denies involvement, with President Hassan Rouhani calling the attack a reciprocal act by the ""Yemeni people"". Yemen's Houthi rebels - who are aligned with Iran - have claimed responsibility. Images show detail of attacks on Saudi oil sites Attack on Saudis destabilises already volatile region However, the US has cast doubt on their ability to carry out strikes of this magnitude and accuracy without assistance. The Saudi-led military coalition in Yemen, which is in direct conflict with the Houthis, believes Iran provided the weapons. ""We call on all parties to prevent any such attacks occurring again because that can have negative consequences for the whole region, and we are also extremely concerned about a risk of escalation,"" Mr Stoltenberg told the AFP news agency in an interview. The Houthis have launched attacks on Saudi soil before, including on oil pipelines. But this attack was on a much bigger scale, hitting the world's biggest oil-processing plant and another oil field. One of the US government's satellite images showing apparent damage at the world's biggest oil-processing facility The knock-on effect was a5% cut in global oil suppliesand soaring prices. Experts say it could take weeks before the facilities are fully functioning again. US President Donald Trump, who over the weekend stopped short of directly accusing Iran, said on Monday that it looked like it was behind the attack. But he added: ""We want to find definitively who did this."" Iran-US tensions: What's going on? He also said the US was ""more prepared than anyone"" for conflict, but would rather avoid it. In a series of tweets, US Defence Secretary Mark Esper accused Iran of undermining ""the international rules-based order"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Iran has discounted the possibility of a meeting between President Rouhani and President Trump on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly next week. There had previously been speculation that they could meet to defuse tensions. UN Yemen envoy Martin Griffiths told the Security Council on Monday it was ""not entirely clear"" who was behind the strike but that it had increased the chances of a regional conflict. In the UK, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab also highlighted the uncertainty, while calling the act a ""wanton violation of international law"". China and the European Union have, separately, urged restraint. The oil price saw its biggest one-day rise since the 1991 Gulf War, soaring 20% but falling back later. The international benchmark used by traders, Brent crude, jumped to $71.95 (Â£57.53) a barrel at one point. Prices eased after President Trump authorised a possible release of US reserves. The huge US oil stash hidden in underground caves US Energy Secretary Rick Perry told business channel CNBC thatit was too early to tell if this would be necessary,external. There are concerns that higher prices could continue if tensions worsen further. Mr Trump has tried to downplay the impact on the market. The attacks targeted Abqaiq, the site of the world's largest oil processing plant, run by the Saudi state oil company, Aramco, and the Khurais oilfield. Khurais is the closest of the targets to the Yemen border, but is still a considerable 770km (480 miles) away. US officials said there were 19 points of impact on the targets, which could have come from a mix of drones and cruise missiles. They have told media outlets that they believe the attacks did not originate from Houthi-controlled territory in Yemen, which lies to the south-west of the Saudi oil facilities, and instead were launched from the north or north-west. The officials said that could suggest launch sites in the northern Gulf, Iran or Iraq but no conclusive evidence has been provided. Iraq denied at the weekend that the attacks were launched from its territory. Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi said the US assured him in a phone call on Monday that it backed Iraq's position. Saudi Arabia and Iran are locked in a fierce struggle for regional dominance. The decades-old feud is exacerbated by religious differences. They each follow one of the two main branches of Islam - Iran is largely Shia Muslim, while Saudi Arabia sees itself as the leading Sunni Muslim power. The two countries are not directly fighting but they are engaged in a variety of proxy wars (conflicts where they support rival sides and militias) around the region. Read more about Saudi-Iranian relations The Houthis have repeatedly launched rockets, missiles and drones at populated areas in Saudi Arabia. The attacks have left at least four civilians dead. The Yemen conflict escalated in March 2015, when the Houthis seized control of much of the west of the country and forced President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi to flee abroad.

"A revised Brexit deal, acceptable to both UK and EU negotiators, remains elusive. Only a few people know exactly what has been discussed behind closed doors, and the legal text of any proposed agreement has not been made public. But it's worth bearing in mind that most of the deal hammered out by Theresa May's government -the withdrawal agreementand the accompanying political declaration - would remain in place. The main changes Boris Johnson's government wants to see concern the Irish border, and the type of relationship it wishes the UK to have with the EU in the future. All sides have ruled out customs checks at the land border in Ireland (between Northern Ireland and the Republic), and Mr Johnson's suggestion that checks could take place at ""designated locations"" away from the border was rejected by the EU. That means there would have to be some customs checks within the UK instead, at ports along the Irish Sea between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. That's a big UK concession. But Mr Johnson also insists that Northern Ireland has to leave the EU customs union, along with the rest of the UK, to allow it to take advantage of any future trade deals the government manages to negotiate. The suggested compromise is that the legal customs border between the UK and the EU would be at the land border in Ireland. But the practical border, where checks would actually take place, would be in the Irish Sea. Diplomats say that means Northern Ireland would remain legally in the UK customs territory but it would apply EU customs processes on goods arriving from Great Britain. There would be exemptions, including on personal items and other goods, to be agreed at a later date by the UK and the EU. So it's a dual customs system, which has no obvious parallel anywhere else in the world, and it raises plenty of technical and legal issues which will take some time to pin down. There's also the issue of political consent in Northern Ireland. Both sides agree that any new economic status for Northern Ireland, which sets it apart from the rest of the country, needs to win democratic approval. But the EU won't accept anything that appears to give a veto to one party in Northern Ireland, in this case the government's allies in the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP). That, in the EU's view, would mean the entire proposed settlement on the Irish border could be unexpectedly torn up with nothing to replace it. The Northern Ireland Assembly has not been sitting for more than 1,000 days For its part, the DUP has been arguing that the Good Friday agreement, which forms the basis of the Northern Ireland peace process, provides for a dual majority (in other words a majority among both unionist and nationalist representatives) on controversial issues in the Northern Ireland assembly. Others in Northern Ireland argue that if a dual majority is needed, then the prospect of Northern Ireland leaving the EU should also be subject to similar dual consent. Diplomats say the latest draft agreement outlines a plan which would give the Northern Ireland Assembly a consent vote four years after the Brexit transition period ends in 2020. If it voted to continue the new arrangements by a simple majority, another vote would be held four years later. If the vote was carried with a dual majority it would be held again eight years later. Diplomats say that if the Assembly voted to end the arrangements, the UK and the EU would have two years to negotiate a new method to avoid a hard border. All of this would replace the so-called backstop- the proposed guarantee to avoid a hard border in Ireland under all circumstances. But so far, the DUP has made it pretty clear that it cannot accept the proposals as they stand. The UK has submitted a new draft of the political declaration on the future relationship. Again, the text has not been made public, but Mr Johnson has made it clear that he wants a looser economic relationship with the EU in the future than Mrs May was seeking. Diplomats say the political declaration will point towards a free trade agreement between the UK and the EU with zero tariffs or quotas, but one which is embedded in a framework for economic competition that is ""fair"". One of the key phrases to watch out for here is the ""level playing field"" - the degree to which the UK will agree to stick closely to EU regulations on things like social and environmental policies. Mr Johnson wants to make fewer level playing field guarantees, and the EU fears that could mean he will seek to undercut EU regulation in the future to gain a competitive advantage. And that in turn has made a number of EU countries even more determined that any solution for the Irish border is legally watertight and fully thought through, before they sign up to any amended Brexit deal. In any complex negotiation, there is nearly always an issue bubbling under the surface which emerges as a last-minute hitch. This time it is VAT, and how to prevent fraud involving goods crossing any new border arrangement. On all of these issues, time is against the negotiators and their political masters. Mr Johnson still says he is determined to leave the EU on 31 October. But if the House of Commons has not voted in favour either of a deal or of leaving with no deal by 19 October, then UK law says he must seek an extension to the Brexit process. The EU has said it will not negotiate directly with Mr Johnson during the summit, which begins on Thursday. But the next few days are obviously crucial. Brexit - British exit - refers to the UK leaving the EU. A public vote was held in June 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain.

"Two survivors of the Bethany Home in Dublin have called for an apology from the Irish state and Church of Ireland for their ill-treatment. James Fenning, 78, who lives in County Antrim, and Paul Graham, 80, based in Sydney, said their lives have been blighted. The home, which closed in the 1960s, was a place for unmarried Protestant mothers and their children. It was run by a committee of Protestant clergy and lay people. Bethany Home children angry at Irish authorities Tuam babies: 'Significant quantities' of human remains discovered Mr Fenning and Mr Graham, who were both adopted from the home by families in Northern Ireland, met for the first time in an emotional meeting in Belfast on Saturday. They said they each felt uplifted to have found each other to share their experiences. Both men have a condition they attribute to severe malnourishment as infants. Mr Fenning said he was neglected when ""nursed out"" to a home with 20 children in return for 15 shillings, while Mr Graham said he was emotionally damaged by several failed adoptions arranged by Bethany Home. This video can not be played James Fenning calls for an apology over Bethany Home They said the Irish government had ""discriminated"" against them as Protestants in failing to offer redress for those who lived at the home. The Bethany Home was excluded from the Irish government's residential institutions redress scheme because it was deemed ""not to qualify"" since it was a home for mothers and children. Mr Fenning and Mr Graham also want an apology from the Church of Ireland as they are convinced it played a key role in the home, but the Church strongly denies this. It said it neither ran nor managed the home. The Bethany Home Survivors Group '98 argue the church consigned women and children to the home. In 2010, it also received a letter from Ireland's Department of Justice,which appeared to cast doubt on the Church's claim that the home was completely independent of it. ""The Church of Ireland denies all responsibility,"" said Mr Fenning, who left the home when he was about four. ""The Dublin government don't think we're fit to get redress, yet all the Catholic homes got redress, so is it discrimination against Protestants?"" Anestimated â¬1.5bn was paid out to historical abuse victimsin the Republic as part of a financial redress scheme set up in 2009 following a government inquiry. However, none of that money has gone to people who say they were ill-treated at the Bethany Home. The Bethany is included in a new inquiry - the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes - set up in 2015 following allegations aboutthe deaths and burial of 800 babies in Tuam, County Galway. A shrine in Tuam, County Galway dedicated to babies buried on the site of a former mother-and-baby home The commission is due to submit its final findings in February 2020. A Department of Education spokesperson said the original redress scheme had been closed to new applications since September 2011 and would not be reopened. The spokesperson said the scheme was ""intended to deal with a very particular circumstance, namely, the abuse of children that occurred while the state was acting to a significant degree in loco parentis, where children had been removed by the state from their parents and placed out of their protection"". He added: ""If we got a bit of honesty from the Church of Ireland, from the Dublin government, to say 'we hold our hands up, you were cruelly treated in the Bethany home', that would suffice."" Adopted by a wealthy Belfast family in 1944, Mr Graham ran away from his home at the age of 14 to join the Royal Marines and later became an alcoholic because of childhood trauma. He said one of his first memories is ""rows and rows of cots"" at Bethany Home. This video can not be played Paul Graham calls for an apology over Bethany Home He said he wanted the Church and the government to apologise and admit it had ""made mistakes"". ""All I want is redress, I just want to be treated the same as any other Irish citizen, I want to be treated as a human being,"" he said. He claimed the authorities had ""washed their hands of Bethany and done little to help survivors"". Both men are among a group of campaigners who have sought recognition for children and infants of Bethany Home since the 1990s. Paul Graham as a child As part of the campaign, a memorial was erected in a Dublin graveyard in 2014 on the previously unmarked graves of more than 200 babies and infants from the home. Many of them are understood to have died from ailments including TB and malnutrition. A Church of Ireland spokesman said Bethany Home was owned and managed by the Dublin Prison Gate Mission, which it said was an ""independent trust set up in the 19th Century to work with former prisoners"" and was not owned by the Church of Ireland. ""In terms of pastoral outreach, the Church has always sought to listen to people in difficulty, including people from various homes and institutions. ""In the case of Bethany Home, the Church wrote to the Irish state on behalf of former residents, and asked that their story would be heard as part of the wider investigations being carried out by the state. ""The Irish state responded positively to the request and the home is therefore being considered as part of the remit of the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes.""

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""We are now in the stage where we have to start really accelerating the work"" The Brexit process has turned into a ""nightmare"", the prime minister of Luxembourg has said after holding talks with UK PM Boris Johnson. Xavier Bettel said Mr Johnson had failed to put forward any serious plans to allow a deal by 31 October. But Mr Johnson, who cancelled his press conference because of the noise from protesters, said ""there's been a lot of work"" and ""papers have been shared"". He urged the EU to make ""movement"" in its opposition to scrap the backstop. Mr Johnson said his joint press conference was cancelled over fears the two leaders would have been ""drowned out"" by pro-EU protesters. ""I don't think it would have been fair to the prime minister of Luxembourg,"" he said. ""I think there was clearly going to be a lot of noise and I think our points might have been drowned out."" Political editor Laura Kuenssberg said that Number 10 had asked for the press conference to be held inside, according to sources. Allow Twitter content?

Mr Bettel, who conducted the planned press conference alone, said the ""only solution"" was the existing withdrawal agreement. Johnson backed Leave to help career, says Cameron How are the UK's talks with the EU going? What will happen with Brexit in the next month? Kuenssberg: Is PM's Brexit deadline impossible? Where do the parties stand on Brexit? He said there were ""no concrete proposals at the moment on the table"" from the UK and said the EU ""needs more than just words"". ""We need written proposals and the time is ticking so stop speaking and act,"" he said. ""But we won't accept any agreement that goes against a single market, who will be against the Good Friday Agreement."" This video can not be played Luxembourg's PM spoke beside the empty podium where Boris Johnson was due to appear Away from the crowds, Mr Johnson said the EU must make ""movement"" in its opposition to scrap the Irish backstop, but insisted there was ""just the right amount of time"" to get a deal done. When asked what concrete proposals he had made, Mr Johnson said ""there's been a lot of work"" and ""papers have been shared"". ""We've got to manage this carefully. Yes, we've got a good chance of a deal. Yes, I can see the shape of it. Everybody could see roughly what could be done,"" he said. He reiterated that the UK will come out of the EU on 31 October ""deal or no deal"". As soon as we arrived at the office of the prime minister of Luxembourg it became obvious a planned outdoor news conference could not go ahead. The anti-Brexit protesters in the square numbered fewer than a hundred but their music and megaphones made it sound like a lot more and they occasionally used language you wouldn't want to hear on the news. Behind the scenes the British and Luxembourgish delegations grappled with a diplomatic dilemma - move the event inside but exclude the majority of the journalists? Gamble that the demonstrators could pipe down for a bit? Silence the host to save the guest's blushes? The end result saw Mr Johnson do a short interview at the ambassador's residence to be shared with everyone while Mr Bettel took to the stage next to an empty podium. He used the moment in the spotlight to deliver an impassioned speech, made all the more dramatic by the fact he's famed as one of the EU's most smiley, mild-mannered leaders. Earlier, both Mr Johnson and Mr Juncker - who met for the first time since the PM took office in July - agreed the discussions between the UK and EU ""needed to intensify"" and meetings ""would soon take place on a daily basis"". But regardless of the outcome, No 10 said the PM would take the UK out of the EU on 31 October. Downing Street also said Mr Johnson confirmed his commitment to the Good Friday Agreement - the peace deal brokered in Northern Ireland - and still had a ""determination to reach a deal with the backstop removed, that UK parliamentarians could support"". This is the first official meeting between the two men since Mr Johnson took office Mr Johnson has called the Irish backstop ""undemocratic"" and said it needed to be removed from any deal with the EU. A Downing Street spokesperson said Mr Johnson also reiterated he would not request an extension and would take the UK out of the EU on 31 October. The EU has said it is willing to look at alternatives, but that an insurance policy like the backstop must be in place. The backstop is the controversial policy in the existing withdrawal agreement, rejected three times by MPs, which would require the UK to follow the EU's customs rules to ensure there are no physical checks on the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic. Last week MPs passed a law that would force the prime minister to ask the EU for an extensionto the 31 October deadline if a deal was not agreed by 19 October. But the prime minister's official spokesman said: ""The position of the PM is that we comply with the law, but that we are leaving on 31 October whatever the outcome."" They also confirmed that the current date set for a transition period - the time for the UK and EU to negotiate their future relationship after officially leaving - of December 2020 would not be extended. The two men dined at restaurant Le Bouquet Garni Over the weekend Mr Johnson told a newspaper that the UK would break out of its ""manacles"" like cartoon character The Incredible Hulk - with or without a deal. The BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg said the issue of whether the UK had the legal right to leave on 31 October - come what may - could end up in court. Reports have suggested Mr Johnson is considering a plan to keep Northern Ireland more closely aligned to the EU after Brexit, as an alternative to the current Irish backstop. A simple guide to Brexit Why is the Irish border blocking Brexit? The Democratic Unionist Party - which supports the Conservatives in Parliament - hasrejected any plan that would see Northern Ireland treated differently to the rest of the UK. The PM's spokesman would not give details, but said the government had ""put forward workable solutions in a number of areas"". The EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier also attended the meeting Writing in Monday's Daily Telegraph, Mr Johnson said,externalhe believed he could strike a deal with the EU within weeks and was working ""flat out to achieve one"". A simple guide to Brexit Why is the Irish border blocking Brexit? ""If we can make enough progress in the next few days, I intend to go to that crucial summit... and finalise an agreement that will protect the interests of business and citizens on both sides of the channel, and on both sides of the border in Ireland,"" he wrote. Many MPs have also questioned how serious the government is about getting a deal, such as former justice secretary David Gauke who said ""detailed proposals"" had yet to be put forward. ""It still remains the case the UK government has not produced detailed proposals as to how it wants to replace the Irish backstop,"" he told Radio 4's Today. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the PM would stress he wanted a deal, but there had to be ""some finality"" to it. He said claims from the EU side that the UK was dragging its feet were part of the ""tactical posturing that goes on in any negotiation"". He told Today the UK had been clear the ""anti-democratic backstop"" had to be removed from the current withdrawal agreement, and the outline of future trading relationship set out in the political declaration had to be much more ambitious. A simple guide to Brexit Why is the Irish border blocking Brexit? ""The EU knows our position. Lots of the detail has been talked through at technical and political level,"" he said. ""The framework is very clear. ""But of course the nature of these negotiations is that there will be a tendency to rubbish things we put forward in order to exact further demands.

"One of the US government's satellite images showing apparent damage at the world's biggest oil-processing facility The United States has issued satellite images and cited intelligence to back its allegation Iran was behind attacks on major Saudi oil facilities. Iran denies involvement in Saturday's air attacks, which were claimed by Iran-aligned Houthi rebels in Yemen. But unnamed US officials speaking to US and international media say the direction and extent of the attacks cast doubt on Houthi involvement. The incident has cut global oil supplies by 5% and prices have soared. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo blamed Iran at the weekend, without providing any evidence, prompting Tehran to accuse Washington of deceit.

Unnamed US officials have been speaking to the New York Times, ABC and Reuters. One official said there were 19 points of impact on the targets and the attacks had come from a west-north-west direction - not Houthi-controlled territory in Yemen, which lies to the south-west of the Saudi oil facilities. The officials said that could suggest launch sites in the northern Gulf, Iran or Iraq. A Saudi-led coalition fighting in Yemen has accused Iran of providing the weapons. Attack on Saudis destabilises already volatile region Iran-US tensions: What's going on? Why Saudi Arabia and Iran are bitter rivals A close-up image of damaged tanks at the Abqaiq processing plant (included above) appeared to show impact points on the western side. Other images seem to show damage at the Khurais oilfield, which is located further west. Iraq denied at the weekend that the attacks were launched from its territory. Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi said Mr Pompeo had assured him in a phone call on Monday that the US backed Iraq's position. Officials quoted by the New York Times said a mix of drones and cruise missiles,externalmight have been deployed, but that not all had hit their targets at Abqaiq and Khurais. China and the European Union have, separately, urged restraint. UN Yemen envoy Martin Griffiths told the Security Council on Monday it was ""not entirely clear"" who was behind the strike but he said it had increased the chances of a regional conflict. In the UK, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab also said it was not yet clear who was responsible, but called the act a ""wanton violation of international law"". The oil price has seen the biggest one-day rise since the 1991 Gulf War, rising 20% but falling back later. The international benchmark used by traders, Brent crude, jumped to $71.95 (Â£57.53) a barrel at one point. Prices eased after President Trump authorised a possible release of US reserves.

The attacks targeted Abqaiq, the site of the world's largest oil processing plant, run by the Saudi state oil company, Aramco, and the Khurais oilfield. Khurais is the closest of the targets to the Yemen border - still a considerable 770km (480 miles) away. Smoke billowing from the oil facility in Abqaiq Saudi Arabia said drones had carried out the attacks, which began at 04:00 (01:00 GMT) and sent huge clouds of thick, black smoke into the air. The Houthi movement said its forces had sent 10 drones towards the facilities and have since warned of further attacks. There were no reports of injuries, but the extent of the damage to the facilities is still not entirely clear. WhySaudi Arabia and Iranare bitter rivals Saudi Arabia and Iran are locked in a fierce struggle for regional dominance. The decades-old feud is exacerbated by religious differences. They each follow one of the two main branches of Islam - Iran is largely Shia Muslim, while Saudi Arabia sees itself as the leading Sunni Muslim power. The two countries are not directly fighting but they are engaged in a variety of proxy wars (conflicts where they support rival sides and militias) around the region. Saudi Arabia is fighting against the rebel Houthi movement in neighbouring Yemen, in part to stem perceived Iranian influence there. Iran has denied accusations that it is supporting the Houthis militarily, though successive reports from a panel of UN experts have demonstrated significant assistance for the Houthis from Tehran in terms of both technology and weaponry. Read more about Saudi-Iranian relations The Houthis have repeatedly launched rockets, missiles and drones at populated areas in Saudi Arabia. The attacks have left at least four civilians dead. The Yemen conflict escalated in March 2015, when the Houthis seized control of much of the west of the country and forced President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi to flee abroad. Saudi Arabia and allies then began an air campaign aimed at restoring Mr Hadi's government. The UN says the conflict has claimed the lives of at least 7,290 civilians and left 80% of the population - 24 million people - in need of humanitarian assistance or protection, including 10 million who rely on food aid to survive.

"Peter Duncan's family described him as a ""devoted father and husband"" A 17-year-old boy has pleaded guilty to murdering a lawyer with a screwdriver. Peter Duncan was stabbed outside a  Greggs in Newcastle city centre's Eldon Square shopping centre on 14 August. The lawyer was ""in the wrong place at the wrong time"" when he was attacked, according to Northumbria Police. The boy, who cannot be named, appeared at Leeds Crown Court via video link and also admitted stealing screwdrivers and carrying an offensive weapon. He will be sentenced in December. A previous hearing was told the teenager had 17 convictions for 31 offences between 2017 and 2019. On one occasion he grabbed a knife during a family argument and on another he threatened a bus driver with a blade after he was challenged about drinking alcohol. Det Ch Insp Jane Fairlamb, from Northumbria Police, said the killing was ""shocking...a much-loved family man was murdered in an unprovoked attack"". At the previous hearing, the court was told 52-year-old Mr Duncan was ""simply in the wrong place at the wrong time"" when he crossed paths with the teenager who had a history of violence and carrying knives. Police cordoned off the entrance to Eldon Square close to where the stabbing occurred The pair came into contact at the entrance to the shopping centre when they were walking in opposite directions. The court was told the teenager was looking for another youth with whom he had previously argued about cigarettes. Mr Duncan raised his arm to let the youth past, but ""the defendant took exception to that"" and ""a struggle ensued"", prosecutor Kevin Wardlaw said. After pushing the youngster off, Mr Duncan was stabbed once through the heart and collapsed a short distance away. The attack was captured on CCTV, and cameras also tracked the teenager's movements through the city centre.

"This video can not be played ""I will obey the law"" The BBC's Laura Kuenssberg sat down for an interview with Prime Minister Boris Johnson after his meeting with the European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker. Here is the full transcript of what they said. Laura Kuenssberg:You've just been with [European Commission president] Jean-Claude Juncker. Do you feel you've made any progress since seeing him. I mean he could be the deal maker? Boris Johnson:Yes. I mean obviously I've talked to him several times since becoming prime minister, but he's... I've known Jean-Claude for many, many years and he is a very, highly, highly intelligent guy and I think that he would like to get a deal if we possibly can, but clearly it's going to take some work. We think that there are, we can satisfy the European Commission and our friends on the key points. Can we protect the single market the integrity the single market? Can we ensure there's no checks at the border in Northern Ireland? Can we protect all the achievements of the Good Friday Agreement and peace in Northern Ireland? Yes I think we can, while simultaneously allowing the whole of the UK to withdraw. It will now take an accelerated timetable of work to, to get that done. And it maybe - you know - just have to say that it may be that we have to come out without an agreement if necessary on 31 October. LK:And we will come to that in a second. But just in the last few minutes, the [European] Commission has put a statement out, saying after your lunch that they still are yet to see proposals that they think are viable and workable. So it doesn't feel like this is going anywhere at the moment? BJ:Well, it's certainly the case that the Commission is still officially sticking on their position that the backstop has got to be there. But clearly if they think that we can come up with alternatives, then I think they're on the mark. I think the big picture is that the Commission would like to do a deal. [Pause to adjust the microphone] LK:I mean the Commission has immediately after your lunch put out a statement saying they still haven't seen viable workable proposals. Do you feel they're listening or is this that they're saying something else behind closed doors to what they say publicly? BJ:No, I think the Commission, I think Jean-Claude himself certainly would like to do a deal and would like the UK to, and would like to settle this if he possibly can. They have their own constraints. They've got the European Parliament they've got to deal with. I think there's a deal there to be done and of the kind that I've described. But clearly if we can't get movement from them on that crucial issue of whether the EU can continue to control the UK and our trade policy and our regulation - which is how it would work under the current Withdrawal Agreement - we won't be able to get that through the House of Commons, no way. And we'll have an exit with no-deal on 31 October. That's not what I want. It's not what they want. And we're going to work very hard to avoid it. But, but that's the reality. LK:But what is the broad shape of a deal that you think is there? I mean we've heard many times from you and ministers that there is a landing zone. As simply as you can, what is the nature of the deal you think you can get? BJ:I mean, I think that the important thing here is not to be... I mean, there is a negotiation going on, has been for a long time now about how to do this. So there's a limit to how much the details benefit from publicity before we've actually done the deal. But the shape of it is, the shape it is... LK:Slice and dice the backstop as it exists? BJ:The shape of it is all about who decides. Fundamentally, the problem with the backstop, as you remember, is that it's a device by which the EU can continue after we've left to control our trade laws, control our tariffs, control huge chunks of our regulation, and we have to keep accepting laws from Brussels long after we've left with no say on those laws. Now that just doesn't work. It doesn't work for the whole of the UK and it doesn't work for Northern Ireland. So we have to find a way to avoid that situation. LK:But what is that way? Because what you're saying there is just articulating the problem that's been articulated forever, about the backstop and people's concern that Northern Ireland would still have to and the rest of the UK would have to go along with EU rules. But can you foresee a solution, for example, when in some areas, Northern Ireland would follow EU rules and the rest of the UK would not? BJ:What we want to see is a solution where the decision is taken by the UK and clearly that's the problem with the, with the backstop. It basically leaves the decision making up to Brussels and that's no good. LK:What's the actual solution that you're proposing? Is it giving more power to Stormont, for example, that's being talked about a lot, that the Northern Irish assembly might be given a lock on opting out or opting in on EU regulation? BJ:These are certainly some of the ideas that are being talked about and as are the ideas that you're familiar with to do with maximum facilitations, to do with checks away from the border, all sorts of ways in which you can avoid a hard border in Northern Ireland. This is all doable. It's all doable with energy and goodwill. But I mentioned the other day when I was in in Dublin, you know the famous dictum attributed I think probably incorrectly to Ian Paisley the elder, [in] Northern Ireland the people are British, but the cattle are Irish, you know there's a there's a germ of an idea there. LK:But it's just the germ of an idea... BJ:There's a lot of thinking going on about how to get an agreement that gets the UK out whole and entire, but also protects that Northern Irish border, protects that peace process and protects all the gains that Ireland has got from its membership of the EU single market. So, I'm, you know, I mean, more or less where I was the other day. I'm cautiously optimistic, cautious. But it is vital that we're ready to come out on 31 October. And of course what the... parliamentarians threatening to extend and all that kind of thing. They hear that they listened to that over here, but I didn't think it substantially changes their calculations. LK:MPs though haven't just threatened to extend, MPs have changed the law to try to stop you taking the UK out without a deal at the end of October. How do you propose to get round that? Because you keep saying you've got no intention of delay... BJ:I won't. Here's, here's what I want. I will uphold the constitution, I will obey the law, but we will come out on 31 October. LK:But how if MPs have changed the law to stop you doing that? BJ:We're going to come out on 31 October and it's vital that people understand that the UK will not extend. We won't go on remaining in the EU beyond October. What on earth is the point? Do you know how much it costs? LK:But how will you do that if MPs have changed the law to stop you? Are you looking for a way round the law? Because that's what it sounds like... BJ:We will obey the law but we will come out - and - we will come out I should say on 31 October. LK:But that means you are looking for a way round the law. I mean, to be really clear about this, Parliament has changed the law to make it almost impossible to take us out of the EU without a deal at the end of October. But you say that you will not do it. That means that you must be looking for a way around the law? BJ:Well, you know those are your words. What we're going to do is come out on 31 October deal or no-deal. And staying in beyond 31 October completely... crackers. You're spending Â£1bn a month for the privilege remaining in the... what is the point? The people of this country want us to get on and leave the EU and deliver on the mandate of the people. And staying in costs Â£250m a week, which is which is roughly the same as what it would cost to build a new hospital every week. That's what Jeremy Corbyn and the opposition parties seem to think is a good idea. I don't think it's a good idea. LK:You used to say it cost Â£350m a week, now you're saying Â£250m a week? BJ:I think the priorities of the British people are to come out and that's what we're going to do. LK:But do you really think that you want to be the kind of prime minister that is looking of ways of sneaking around the law to keep to your political promise? I mean, everybody knows how strongly you feel... BJ:These are all your words. LK:But how will you do it then? Will you challenge it in court? Will you take Parliament to court? BJ:Our first priority, if I may say so, just to try and look on the bright side for a second or two, is to come out with a deal and that's what we're working to achieve. And I think we have every prospect of doing that. LK:But if you don't, I mean you are looking, you know the law has been changed to try to make this impossible. If you want to look for a way round it, many people believe that means you must be preparing somehow to ignore the law or to challenge that because it's a new area of law. Would you seek to challenge the law in court? Will the government take Parliament to court? BJ:What we're going to do is work very hard to get a deal that will allow us to come out. I see no point whatever in staying on in the EU beyond 31 October and we're going to come out. And actually that is what our friends and partners in the EU would like too. And I think that they've had a bellyful of all this stuff. You know they want to develop a new relationship with the UK. They're fed up with these endless negotiations, endless delays. They've now delayed twice before to achieve what is completely unclear to me. LK:And you're completely clear that politically the promise you gave to your party was to leave on 31 October. And that was clear as crystal. But since you've been in office you've suspended Parliament. You say you might find a way around the way that Parliament might change the law... BJ:Well, that's what you've just said. LK:Well, you haven't denied it prime minister. I mean it does seem since you've been in office that, some of the things that you have done, you seem to believe the conventions and rules somehow don't apply to you really? BJ:Obviously I humbly, respectfully, disagree. If you're talking about having a Queen's Speech, I think that was the right thing to do. This Parliament has gone on for longer than any time since the Civil War. It's right to have a Queen's Speech, it's right to set out our ambitious agenda for the country. There's all sorts of things we want to do. Whether it's investing in health care and putting police on the streets. We've got a fantastic agenda for investing in science. A huge, huge agenda for this country. On the environment, on housing we have big, big projects. We need a Queen's Speech. And by the way, all this mumbo jumbo about how Parliament is being deprived of the opportunity to scrutinise Brexit. What a load of claptrap. Actually, Parliament I think has lost about four or five days. I don't think Parliament has sat during the period from late September beginning of October for about 120 years. With great respect, I don't think people are aware of that fact. I think people think that we've somehow stopped Parliament from scrutinising Brexit. What absolute nonsense. Parliament will be able to scrutinise the deal that I hope we will be able to do both before and after the European Council on 17 October. LK:But when it comes to sticking to the promise you made to leave on 31 October... BJ:We're going to do that. LK:Is there a line that you would not cross? BJ:Well yes, obviously I didn't want to go beyond 31 October. I think that would be a mistake. LK:In order to stick to that goal, is there anything that you would not do? Would you rule out suspending parliament again? BJ:As I say, we're going to uphold the constitution and we're going to obey the law. And it's very important to realise that actually, I think our friends and partners in the EU are keen to work with us to get a deal. That's what I've been doing here with Jean-Claude Juncker and Michel Barnier. We've been working very hard. We've had a good productive exchange. Has there been a total breakthrough? I wouldn't say so. But I would say that a huge amount of work is now going to be done to sort it out. Am I more optimistic than I was when I, when we took office? This morning? I would say a little bit, but not much, just a little bit. Because I think that there's a, perhaps an even greater willingness on the part of the Commission to engage than I had, than I had thought. So, so yes. I'm cautiously optimistic, but I'm not counting my chickens. And it is absolutely vital, it's absolutely vital for people to understand that the UK is ready to come out with no-deal if we have to. LK:Do you feel that the UK is stable right now? I mean, it looks like chaos, doesn't it? BJ:No, I think it's extremely stable. We've got unemployment at record lows. We have record levels of investment from overseas - one point Â£3tn pounds. There's no other country in Europe that gets these levels of investment. If people genuinely thought, if people genuinely thought that there was some political risk in the UK, would they be investing in this in this country in the way that they are? LK:Does it look politically stable? BJ:This is an immensely, but it is an immensely stable country. We are going through what is, after all, a quite difficult exercise in democracy. Which is, what happened is that the people of this country decided after 45 years of EU membership that that highly intricate relationship was one that they no longer wished to pursue. And that has had a great deal of consequence. The disentangling of that relationship is obviously complex, but it can be done and it is being done. And we will get on with it successfully. And I think people should be very optimistic about the future of this country, because it's a fantastic country. It is the leader and the cutting edge of most of the 21st century technology in Europe.  And a place that attracts, not just huge quantities of inward investment, but the best and brightest from around the world. And what we will, what we will ensure as we become, as we take advantage of Brexit, is that we remain not just open to our friends in the rest of the EU, but we reach out now to the rest of the world and take advantage of the opportunities the Brexit offers. And I think actually what the people of our country want is a little less of this sort of gloom and kind of, you know, I think most people think that, honestly it's just nonsensical to think that democracy in the UK is any way endangered or the UK economy is in any way endangered. We're going through a period of constitutional adjustment caused by the decision of the people to leave the EU. That was always going to be logistically and practically difficult to accomplish. But we're going to do it and we're going it by 31 October, and we will be in very good shape whether we get a deal or not. And if we don't get a deal, I'm still, as I say, cautiously optimistic that we will. If we don't get a deal, we will come out nonetheless LK:One of the people who is extremely gloomy about what's happened is your old friend and rival and colleague David Cameron. Now he says that the Leave campaign that you led lied. He said that you behaved appallingly and he's a prime minister, a Tory prime minister, who left behind a total mess over Europe. Are you worried you might face the same fate? BJ:I have nothing but admiration. Look I don't want to say anything further about David Cameron and his memoirs than what I said the other day, which is I have the highest respect and affection, regard for him. He and I worked together for many years and I think he has a legacy, in terms of turning around the economic chaos that Labour left, helping to introduce a jobs miracle in this country, turning the economy around, I think he can be very very proud of. So that's my view on Dave and what he's got to say. LK:He's been pretty brutal about you... BJ:Well. Really? I mean you know. I think that he has a lot to be proud of and there you go.

"Young people are at risk of being recruited as money mules Criminals are recruiting a rising number of teenagers to act as money mules to help them launder the proceeds of crime. The number of cases of 14 to 18-year-olds who have allowed their bank accounts to be used to divert funds has grown by 73% in two years. Banks are using the data, from fraud prevention body Cifas, to alert parents to the risks their children face. Teenagers are being recruited to the illegal activity via social media. Sports clubs, schools and colleges are also key recruiting grounds for criminals who want to move money through accounts to make it look less suspicious to banks. The youngsters are given a cut for allowing their account to be used. Often they ask no questions over the source of the money. Most money mules are young men. Those who try to quit may be threatened with violence by the criminals who recruited them. If they are caught, they could face prison, as well as future difficulties with their finances, such as having their bank account closed and finding it difficult to apply for credit in the future. ""Have you ever held Â£2,000 at once in your hand?"" That was the line used to tempt Holly into becoming a money mule. At the age of 17 and still at school, Holly (not her real name) was approached on Instagram, then Snapchat, by a person who promised to pay her a decent sum, if she let him use her bank account to move money. ""I just eventually gave in,"" she said. Read more about Holly's story Teenagers can open their first current account in their teenage years. The Cifas figures show that money mule cases last year among 14 to 18-year-olds rose by 20% on the previous year, and by 73% over two years, to 5,819. Mike Haley, chief executive of Cifas, said: ""The increasing use of social media means that young people have never been more vulnerable to becoming victims of fraud. ""Many youngsters are unaware of the devastating consequences that fraud can have on their future opportunities, and so teachers, parents and carers can play an important role here by ensuring young people have the necessary knowledge and skills to prevent them from unwittingly falling victim to fraud, or even become perpetrators themselves."" The dangerous world of teen 'money mules' What's the new weapon against money laundering gangsters? Banking trade body UK Finance is behind a new awareness campaign encouraging parents and guardians to look out for danger signs. They include telling youngsters to keep bank details safe, telling them to be cautious of unsolicited offers of easy money, and looking out for signs of their child suddenly having extra cash, or becoming secretive, withdrawn or stressed.

"This video can not be played Luxembourg's PM spoke beside the empty podium where Boris Johnson was due to appear Luxembourg's PM has attacked Boris Johnson's approach to Brexit, calling the situation a ""nightmare"". Xavier Bettel said the British government had failed to put forward any serious proposals for a new deal. But Mr Johnson, who pulled out of a joint press conference with Mr Bettel because of noisy protesters, said there was still a good chance of a deal. A government source said the gap the UK and Brussels needed to bridge to achieve a deal ""remains quite large"". Mr Johnson was visiting Luxembourg to hold talks with the European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and the EU's chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, as well as Mr Bettel. After the working lunch with Mr Juncker and Mr Barnier, Mr Johnson said he had been encouraged by the EU's willingness to engage with the UK in their shared desire to avoid a no-deal exit - but there had not been a ""total breakthrough"". However, the European Commission said the PM had yet to present concrete proposals for it to consider and insisted any new plans had to be ""compatible"" with the existing withdrawal agreement, which has been rejected three times by MPs. There was then confusion after Mr Bettel held a press conference without Mr Johnson amid noisy protests by anti-Brexit protesters. Mr Bettel, who addressed the media on his own after the UK PM pulled out, said his counterpart ""holds the future of all UK citizens in his hands"" and suggested it was his responsibility to break the deadlock in the process. What does 'podiumgate' say about Brexit deal? In full: Boris Johnson interview from Luxembourg How are the UK's talks with the EU going? This video can not be played Johnson: EU have had 'bellyful' of delays Standing next to an empty lectern, Mr Bettel warned Mr Johnson ""you can't hold the future hostage for party political gain"". He said there were ""no concrete proposals at the moment on the table"" on a new Brexit deal from the UK and said the EU ""needs more than just words"". ""We need written proposals and the time is ticking, so stop speaking and act,"" he said. The existing withdrawal agreement was the ""only solution"", he added. Mr Johnson said his joint press conference was cancelled over fears the two leaders would have been ""drowned out"" by pro-EU protesters. It is understood that his request for it to be held inside was turned down. What exactly should we make of the oh so public venting on Monday by the prime minister of Luxembourg following his meeting with Boris Johnson? Does this mean the EU has lost patience and will no longer engage in negotiations with the Johnson government? Can we expect an Angela Merkel rant or a Mark Rutte rave next? Quite the opposite. ""As long as there is a chance of a deal, it's in our own interest to engage. However frustrating negotiations are,"" a high-level EU contact told me. Read more from Katya's blog The EU's Brexit co-ordinator, Guy Verhofstadt, tweeted a photograph of the empty podium where Mr Johnson had been due to speak alongside Mr Bettel with the caption: ""From Incredible Hulk to incredible sulk"".

Over the weekend Mr Johnson told a newspaper that the UK would break out of its ""manacles"" like cartoon character The Incredible Hulk - with or without a deal. After the working lunch with Mr Juncker, Mr Johnson told the BBC's political editor he was ""cautiously optimistic"" about the state of negotiations and suggested the EU wanted to bring the two and half years of arguments about the terms of the UK's exit to an end. ""I see no point whatever in staying on in the EU beyond October 31st and we're going to come out. And actually that is what our friends and partners in the EU would like too. ""And I think that they've had a bellyful of all this stuff. You know they want to develop a new relationship with the UK. They're fed up with these endless negotiations, endless delays."" This video can not be played 'What a load of claptrap' While he was working ""very hard"" to get a deal, Mr Johnson said there would be no agreement unless the EU shifted its position on the backstop, the insurance policy to maintain an open border on the island of Ireland unless and until another solution is found. ""If we can't get movement from them on that crucial issue... we won't be able to get it through the House of Commons, no way."" He said there were a number of ideas under discussion which would allow the whole of the UK to leave the EU while protecting the integrity of the bloc's single market, upholding the Good Friday Agreement and supporting the Irish economy. These, he said, included the use of technology to minimise border checks as well as the so-called Stormont lock, a mechanism to give Northern Irish politicians a say on the rules that apply to Northern Ireland. ""It is all doable with energy and goodwill,"" he insisted. A UK government source later said: ""It's clear Brussels is not yet ready to find the compromises required for a deal, so no-deal remains a real possibility - as the gap we need to bridge remains quite large."" As soon as we arrived at the office of the prime minister of Luxembourg it became obvious a planned outdoor news conference could not go ahead. The anti-Brexit protesters in the square numbered less than 100 but their music and megaphones made it sound like a lot more and they occasionally used language you wouldn't want to hear on the news. Behind the scenes the British and Luxembourgish delegations grappled with a diplomatic dilemma: Move the event inside but exclude the majority of the journalists? Gamble that the demonstrators could pipe down for a bit? Silence the host to save the guest's blushes? The end result saw Mr Johnson do a short interview at the ambassador's residence to be shared with everyone while Mr Bettel took to the stage next to an empty podium. He used the moment in the spotlight to deliver an impassioned speech, made all the more dramatic by the fact he's famed as one of the EU's most smiley, mild-mannered leaders. Mr Johnson said he would meet the Halloween Brexit deadline come what may, insisting that the UK would be ""in very good shape"" whether there was a deal or not. But pushed on how he would get around the law requiring him to ask for an extension if there is no deal by 19 October, the PM did not explain how it would be possible. Ahead of Tuesday's Supreme Court hearing into whether the prorogation of Parliament was lawful, Mr Johnson defended the decision to suspend Parliament. Parliament was prorogued last week, ahead of a Queen's Speech on 14 October. Legal challenges to the decision have been lodged in the courts by opposition MPs and campaigners. Could the Supreme Court overrule the government? What will happen with Brexit in the next month? Mr Johnson described claims that Parliament was ""being deprived of the opportunity to scrutinise Brexit"" as ""all this mumbo jumbo"" and a ""load of claptrap"". ""I think people think that we've somehow stopped Parliament from scrutinising Brexit. ""What absolute nonsense. Parliament will be able to scrutinise the deal that I hope we will be able to do both before and after the European Council on October 17.""

Mike Haley, chief executive of Cifas, said: ""The increasing use of social media means that young people have never been more vulnerable to becoming victims of fraud. ""Many youngsters are unaware of the devastating consequences that fraud can have on their future opportunities, and so teachers, parents and carers can play an important role here by ensuring young people have the necessary knowledge and skills to prevent them from unwittingly falling victim to fraud, or even become perpetrators themselves.""

"The Sun's owner News UK has contacted Twitter about stories falsely claiming to be in The Sun TV presenter Kirstie Allsopp says she's been the victim of a scam which has seen her face used to promote slimming pills on Twitter. She has attacked the social media firm for failing to respond to her complaints. Promoted tweets from an organisation called Gonagram use a false story claiming the presenter has been sacked by Channel 4. Clicking on links then leads readers to a promotion for a weight-loss product. In one case, a mocked-up article from the Sun says the property expert dropped from size 16 to size 8 with the help of a celebrity weight-loss method and that Channel 4 sacked her because she had not revealed her links with the firm behind the product. The newspaper has confirmed that the story is false and its lawyers are contacting Twitter about the use of its logo without permission. The TV presenter has quizzed Twitter about ads that falsely claimed she backed the pills ""I've been with Channel 4 for 20 years,"" Kirstie Allsopp told the BBC. ""The idea that someone can create a false article that totally looks like it was in The Sun saying I've been fired is utterly bizarre."" The presenter has contacted Twitter about the false claims, but says she has received no satisfactory answers. Responding to her complaint that she had been impersonated, Twitter emailed her this: ""In order for an account to be in violation of the impersonation policy, it must portray another person or business in a misleading or deceptive manner. We've investigated the account you reported, and have determined that it is not in violation."" In a tweet, Kirstie Allsopp attacked the social media giant, suggesting that it was motivated only by the money it earns from advertising. ""Can't you see how damaging this is to our belief in you & our ability to judge what is true and what's not? Why aren't you hearing this? Does money speak so loudly that you're deafened to any other voices?"" There have been reports that similar articles making false claims about the presenter's endorsement of the weight loss pills have appeared on Facebook, Instagram and other social media networks. Earlier this year the consumer finance expert Martin Lewis dropped a lawsuit against Facebook over thousands of ads on its platform which used his name and image to promote false claims that he backed investment schemes. The company agreed to pay Â£3 million to fund a scheme to fight online scams. The BBC has contacted Twitter to seek its response to Kirstie Allsopp's complaint. It has also contacted Gonagram, but the company has not yet responded to a request for comment.

"Joshua Browder's first creation was an algorithm that fights parking fines. A service which automatically cancels subscriptions at the end of the free trial period has launched in the UK. It was developed by Josh Browder, who as a teenager developed an algorithm called Do Not Pay, which continues to successfully fight parking fines. His new app, Free Trial Surfing, is not linked to a customer's bank account or credit card, but Mr Browder says it is in partnership with a major bank. However, he declined to say which bank was supporting the venture. ""The idea for this product came when I realised I was being charged for a $21.99 (Â£18) gym membership from over a year ago that I was never using,"" he said. ""In fact, I had completely forgotten that I had signed up for a free trial in the first place. Constantly trying to keep track of when a 'free trial' period ends is annoying and time-consuming."" He said 10,000 people had signed up to try Free Trial Surfing since its launch six weeks ago in the US, where Mr Browder, who is from the UK, now lives. The two most common subscriptions the service has been used for are porn platforms followed by Netflix, he said. It is currently only available on Apple's app store, with a web version in development. Each customer receives a virtual credit card number and invented name, which they can use to sign up for a service. The card is actually registered to Mr Browder's firm, Do Not Pay. The app can also forward emails between the service provider and the virtual card so that the customer's own email address is secure. Mr Browder says the card will not work if used to pay for any other form of purchase. He said some platforms were trying to block the service by figuring out which cards belong to Do Not Pay. ""Our bank is so big they would have to screw a lot of customers to stop the product. They would have to end the entire free-trial programme,"" he said. Perhaps ironically, he says that one day he may charge a subscription to use the service, which is currently free. ""It took around six months to build,"" he said. ""Right now we're testing it - maybe one day it will be a cheap subscription, like $2 per month. ""The reason it took so long was that we wanted to be sure it would be declined if it is used with a real purchase. We won't hold people to account - it will be us who takes the hit."" Personal finance journalist Felicity Hannah gave the venture a cautious welcome. ""It sounds like a great idea because consumers are constantly caught out by these subscription traps,"" she said. ""I consider myself to be fairly savvy but I've been caught out twice in the last year. ""But I do have some concerns and, as a consumer, I'd want to see it being used safely by other people before I signed up."" Ms Hannah added that the service might only be short-lived if it really rattled retailers and service providers. ""Consumers shouldn't worry too much about the ethics but it is breaching the concept of a free trial. You would have to sign up again if you did want to continue with a service so the assumption is clearly that you don't intend to,"" she said. ""If this took off, then I expect it wouldn't be too long before companies tried to find a way around it. [It's] definitely an interesting idea though.

"A community platform called SuperSisters, aimed at young Muslim women, has defended receiving a grant from the Home Office. However, it apologised on social media for not being more open about the source of its funding. It said it had retained ""full independent control"" over its output. SuperSisters's parent company, J-Go, isone of 233 groups,externalthat received funding via the government's Building a Stronger Britain Together programme. SuperSisters describes itself as ""a global media platform for young Muslimahs in... east London and beyond to share and create inspiring and empowering content with positivity at its core"". The Home Office said J-Go had received funding since 2018. While its list of successful recipients includes J-Go, it does not specifically name SuperSisters. ""BSBT is an open and transparent programme, which supports local people in their vital work to bring communities together, promote fundamental values and tackle the spread of all extremist ideologies,"" it said in a statement. Home Office role in 'Woke' Muslim network revealed The platform launched in 2015, in response to the actions of Shamima Begum, who fled Britain to join the Islamic State group in Syria at the age of 15. In a statement on its website,external, J-Go said it had accepted the grant to pay its staff a living wage and countering extremism was part of its purpose.

"Aldi's profits fell 18% last year Aldi plans to open a new store in the UK every week on average for the next two years, its boss has told the BBC. Giles Hurley said the discount retailer would invest Â£1bn to achieve its aim. ""The reality is that almost 50% of the population of the UK doesn't currently shop with us and they tell us the main reason for that is that they don't have a store near us,"" he said. Aldi's pledge came as it reported a sales rise for last year, but saw profits fall sharply. Last year, the company attracted more than 800,000 new customers, adding an extra Â£1.1bn in sales, up 11% on the previous twelve months.  But most of this sales growth is from opening new stores. This video can not be played Aldi's Giles Hurley Profits for the same period fell 18%, partly due to price cuts aimed at keeping its competitive edge. Whilst the big established grocers are opening few, if any new stores, Aldi is still expanding, stealing their customers and growing market share. And that is set to continue. ""Over the next two years we're going to invest a further billion pounds in the UK and that shows our intent,"" says Mr Hurley, Aldi's chief executive for the UK and Ireland. Aldi plans to double the number of its stores within the M25 Aldi now has over 840 stores and is increasing its focus on London. It wants to double the number of stores inside the M25, from 45 to 100, by the end of 2025. ""Within Greater London, our market share is around half of what it is in the rest of the country so there's clearly a big opportunity for us to expand the business. In the long term, we can comfortably see us opening 200-250 stores within London,"" says Mr Hurley. But will they be able to find enough locations to fit their low-cost business model? ""It's not straightforward as you don't have the parking spaces,"" says Adam Leyland, editor of the Grocer magazine. ""It's also harder to get good sites in London. So you have to have a very flexible model and Aldi is so formulaic as a discounter that this is harder to manage. ""But they are determined to do it and they are a very capable grocer. We've seen over the years how they've responded to the dynamics of the UK market."" When Aldi opens a new store the shoppers come. Here in Ruabon, on the outskirts of Wrexham, customers were queuing round the block, lured by the promise of an early freebie. It felt like Black Friday had come early. The rush was on for the so called ""Aisle of Wonder"" - ""starbuys"" included a Â£24.99 cordless lawnmower and a cut price vacuum cleaner. Families were dragging six-seater wooden patio sets towards the tills. Another woman's trolley was filled with three Mr Potato Heads, four rabbit-shaped wicker planters and a wooden wishing well for her garden. The first customer, Ken Peters, had been waiting since 5:30am to get in: ""I'm hoping for a bargain, or a free food voucher,"" he says. Aldi is already experimenting with a new, smaller, convenience store format. There are currently eight Aldi ""Local"" stores in Greater London, including a former Waitrose store in Camden.  Aldi thinks that figure could grow to as high as 50 in the longer term. So how long can this rapid expansion last? ""The fundamental question for Aldi, Lidl and all the other discounters, like B&M, across the retail sectors is that at some point they will reach their peak physical space,"" says Patrick O'Brien, UK retail director at market research firm GlobalData. ""The rate of growth they're enjoying isn't going to last forever. ""So they're going to be in the same boat as their bigger rivals, going head to head for their share of the spend in their existing store estates, and as the discounters have expanded they are more often found in each other's catchment areas, competing with each other rather than the easier job of taking spend from higher priced rivals,"" he believes. Aldi says keeping prices low has hit its profits But that's not something Aldi has to worry about right now when it's got years of growth ahead to manage, argues Mr Leyland. ""Aldi are clearly performing very well. The crucial thing is that when they open a store people come. Aldi will only have a problem if it opens new stores and people aren't attracted to them and I can't see any evidence of that."" But the Big Four supermarket chains aren't making it easy. They've been improving their offer and trying to close the price gap with the discounters. Aldi's promise to keep prices lower took its toll on last year's profits. But Mr Hurley, is adamant that it's a promise he's prepared to keep: ""Our profits did suffer as a result of the investments we made, but Aldi is not like other supermarkets. We take a very long-term view of our business and the focus is very much on our sales, our customers and our store numbers and not on short term profitability. ""The plans we put down last year were carefully considered. We've always said that we will offer the lowest prices in the market,"" he says. Ahead of Brexit, Aldi is stocking up on items which aren't produced in the UK The biggest challenge right now for all the UK's grocers is Brexit. So does Aldi believe there will be gaps on the shelves in the event of a disorderly no deal? ""I can't guarantee the availability of every single product,"" says Mr Hurley. ""But actually that's no different from anyone else. What we will do is shield our customers from as many ripple effects as possible. I can't commit that prices won't go up. I'm not alone in the industry on that but what I can guarantee is that customers will always pay the lowest grocery prices with Aldi."" Mr Hurely said the chain was working ""very closely"" with its supply base. ""Because of our select range of products that's probably a little easier than some of our competitors. ""We also believe we're in a solid position because 75% of what we sell comes from British suppliers and manufacturers"", he says. Aldi is increasing stocks in items like olive oil, tinned tomatoes and pasta, items which aren't produced in the UK. Brexit, says the Grocer's Mr Leyland, is Aldi's biggest worry right now. ""It's the biggest challenge for the whole food industry at the moment. Everyone is working crazily to come up with solutions. ""Aldi may have fewer products to worry about but it's a double-edged sword because if one product isn't getting through it's harder to flex it. And although they're very competitive, they've struggled to manage inflation like everyone else."" Whatever happens, Aldi is clear that Brexit won't change its expansion plans. This business, along with Lidl, has had a profound effect on the UK grocery market. Aldi alone took Â£7bn of sales in the last year that would otherwise have gone to its rivals, according to the research, data and insight consultancy, Kantar. As long as it is continuing to open new stores, it's likely to be a hugely disruptive force.

"This video can not be played Solid gold toilet stolen in Blenheim Palace heist The theft of a solid gold toilet from Blenheim Palace has echoes of ""a heist movie"", the stately home's chief executive has said. Dominic Hare said artist Maurizio Cattelan was ""mortified"" by the theft from the stately home in Oxfordshire. Valued at $6m (Â£4.8m), the artwork has not been found since Saturday's early-morning raid at Blenheim - the home of the Duke of Marlborough. A 66-year-old man who was arrested on Saturday has been released on bail. Mr Hare told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""You always take a risk in showing art. The safest thing to do with art, I suppose, is to put it in a strongroom and lock the door. ""We think that risk is worth taking."" The fully working toilet - entitled America - went on show at the 18th Century palace on Thursday as part of anexhibition by the Italian artist. Visitors had been invited to book three-minute slots to use the throne for its intended purpose. Police believe a gang of thieves using at least two vehicles was responsible for the theft. Italian artist Maurizio Cattelan says he hopes the theft is a ""kind of Robin Hood-inspired action"" In an email to the New York Times, Cattelan said: ""'America' was the 1% for the 99%, and I hope it still is. ""I want to be positive and think the robbery is a kind of Robin Hood-inspired action. ""I promise I have an alibi for the night."" Last month Edward Spencer-Churchill - half-brother of the Duke of Marlborough - said the toiletwould not ""be the easiest thing to nick,external"". The burglary caused ""significant damage and flooding"" because the toilet was plumbed into the building, police said. Mr Hare said it was the ""first theft of this type in living memory"" from the stately home - the birthplace of Sir Winston Churchill - adding it had ""a sophisticated security system"". ""But the truth is, this has happened and we are now challenged to look hard at ourselves and improve again,"" he said. England's only county without a McDonald's The hidden dangers of magnet fishing Giant veg: Heavyweight champions of the earth Blenheim Palace, a World Heritage Site, was shut on Saturday after the burglary but reopened on Sunday. Mr Hare said the artwork - famously offered to US President Donald Trump in 2017 - was a ""comment on the American dream"". ""[It's] the idea of something that's incredibly precious and elite being made accessible, potentially to everybody, as we all need to go when we need to go,"" he said. ""And it's ironic, really, that two days after this was made accessible, it was snatched away."" Mr Hare said it was ""not out of the question [the toilet] would be melted down"" by the thieves.

"This video can not be played Wales is ""drowning in street drugs"" due to the rise of county lines gangs, an addiction specialist has warned. The National Crime Agency said more than 100 gangs were operating in towns across Wales, with drug bosses pulling the strings mainly from London, Birmingham and Liverpool. Authorities think the network started in 2015 and cocaine and heroin deaths have spiked in the past five years. ""It feels like we're drowning in street drugs at the moment and I think there's worse to come,"" said Carly Jones of drug awareness organisation PSALT.

"Joshua Browder's first creation was an algorithm that fights parking fines. A service which automatically cancels subscriptions at the end of the free trial period has launched in the UK. It was developed by Josh Browder, who as a teenager developed an algorithm called Do Not Pay, which continues to successfully fight parking fines. His new app, Free Trial Surfing, is not linked to a customer's bank account or credit card, but Mr Browder says it is in partnership with a major bank. However, he declined to say which bank was supporting the venture. ""The idea for this product came when I realised I was being charged for a $21.99 (Â£18) gym membership from over a year ago that I was never using,"" he said. ""In fact, I had completely forgotten that I had signed up for a free trial in the first place. Constantly trying to keep track of when a 'free trial' period ends is annoying and time-consuming."" He said 10,000 people had signed up to try Free Trial Surfing since its launch six weeks ago in the US, where Mr Browder, who is from the UK, now lives. The two most common subscriptions the service has been used for are porn platforms followed by Netflix, he said. It is currently only available on Apple's app store, with a web version in development. Each customer receives a virtual credit card number and invented name, which they can use to sign up for a service. The card is actually registered to Mr Browder's firm, Do Not Pay. The app can also forward emails between the service provider and the virtual card so that the customer's own email address is secure. Mr Browder says the card will not work if used to pay for any other form of purchase. He said some platforms were trying to block the service by figuring out which cards belong to Do Not Pay. ""Our bank is so big they would have to screw a lot of customers to stop the product. They would have to end the entire free-trial programme,"" he said. Perhaps ironically, he says that one day he may charge a subscription to use the service, which is currently free. ""It took around six months to build,"" he said. ""Right now we're testing it - maybe one day it will be a cheap subscription, like $2 per month. ""The reason it took so long was that we wanted to be sure it would be declined if it is used with a real purchase. We won't hold people to account - it will be us who takes the hit."" Personal finance journalist Felicity Hannah gave the venture a cautious welcome. ""It sounds like a great idea because consumers are constantly caught out by these subscription traps,"" she said. ""I consider myself to be fairly savvy but I've been caught out twice in the last year. ""But I do have some concerns and, as a consumer, I'd want to see it being used safely by other people before I signed up."" Ms Hannah added that the service might only be short-lived if it really rattled retailers and service providers. ""Consumers shouldn't worry too much about the ethics but it is breaching the concept of a free trial. You would have to sign up again if you did want to continue with a service so the assumption is clearly that you don't intend to,"" she said. ""If this took off, then I expect it wouldn't be too long before companies tried to find a way around it. [It's] definitely an interesting idea though.

"This video can not be played Murderer Sadam Essakhil wants people to avoid the mistakes that led him to stab A man who is serving a life sentence for a murder he committed as a schoolboy is fronting a new anti-knife crime campaign being shown in schools in the West Midlands. Sadam Essakhil was 15 when he murdered Lukasz Furmanek in Handsworth on 31 May 2015. Like many teenagers in Britain's big cities, he believed he needed to carry a knife for his own protection. He and an older friend, Abdullah Atiqzoy, who was 18, were walking towards an all-night supermarket at 03:00 BST when they encountered two Polish men coming the other way. It is not clear how the fight started but Essakhil and Atiqzoy were armed. In less than 60 seconds, Mr Furmanek lay dying and his friend Joseph Dudek was critically injured having suffered multiple stab wounds. During thetrial at Birmingham Crown Courtthe incident was described as ""sudden, shocking and brutal"". Lukasz Furmanek's mother has experienced mental health issues since his murder Essakhil fled the country but handed himself in to the authorities in Belgium. Atiqzoy was arrested trying to escape to France in the back of a lorry. Mr Dudek had recovered sufficiently to be able to give evidence at their trial. They denied murder and claimed they were acting in self-defence but wereconvicted and sentenced to life. Atiqzoy has to serve 26 years before he will be eligible for parole, while Essakhil has to serve 19. Judge Patrick Thomas QC said what they had done was ""savage and inexcusable"", and the effects were ""horrific and far-reaching"". It is now four years later and Sadam Essakhil has just turned 20. Despite not admitting his guilt and showing no remorse at the time, he now accepts he was responsible for taking a man's life and wants to warn other teenagers not to carry knives. In 2018 nearly 700 children in the West Midlands police area were victims of knife crime. Earlier this year,three teenagers were fatally stabbed in the space of 12 days. The force hopes that his message will hit home where others have not. Killed in 12 days: Victims of Birmingham's knife crime epidemic were (l-r) Hazrat Umar, 18, Abdullah Muhammad and Sidali Mohamed, both 16 During the eight minute-long film West Midlands Police has produced, Essakhil gives more detail than he ever did during his trial. He tells children he is sorry he took another man's life and for the distress he has caused to both Lukasz Furmanek's family and his own. His message to other teenagers who think they need to carry weapons for protection is stark. ""I went out with a knife but not trying to attack people,"" he says. ""I just went out there feeling that I need to protect myself, and obviously one thing leads to another, and you never ever think you're gonna kill someone. But obviously you could end up killing someone. ""When you think about it you don't need that knife. A lot of the times I used to think I was protecting myself but what am I protecting myself from? ""That night, if I never took a life it would have been a fist fight at most."" Sadam Essakhil (right) was jailed for life along with Abdullah Atiqzoy (left), while Feizullah Atiqzoy (middle) was jailed for four years for assisting an offender Life in Britain's cities can be tough, even for 12 and 13-year-olds. At the Bluecoat Academy in Walsall, a group of Year 8 students tell me they get scared if they have to go out on their own, and know there are gangs who could threaten them. After watching the film, Oscar, 12, explained how it made him feel. ""It's quite hard to think that it (can) happen somewhere close to where we all live. It's literally just on our doorsteps."" A week in the life of a London trauma surgeon Domestic killings reach five-year high 'Pay people to cut crime', says report Ismail, also 12, added: ""Around my area a lot of bad things happen, like a few weeks ago there was a gunshot fired. ""People carry it [a knife] for self-defence. What they don't realise is if they get caught carrying that knife around some bad things could happen to them."" The man introducing the film to the students is Det Ch Insp Jim Munro, the officer called to the scene on the night of the murder, and who led the investigation. He hopes the film will be hard-hitting and make teenagers think twice about arming themselves but admits asking a murderer to front the force's latest anti-knife crime campaign from prison was a controversial choice. Det Ch Insp Jim Munro was called to the scene on the night of the murder and now visits schools where the film is being shown He says: ""We know he's in prison. It's not a decision that's been taken lightly, but ultimately this is about getting to the children in the school and talking to them in a language they understand, and [having] somebody who can come across and give that message is really important."" West Midlands Police has kept Lukasz Furmanek's mother Iwona informed about the campaign, and she has given her approval. The effects ofher son's murderhave had a long-term impact on her. She has had mental health problems, finds it difficult to sleep and has had to take anti-depressants. ""I live in a 'vegetative state' now,"" she said. ""I don't care about anything. If I live, I live, if I don't, I don't. I feel indifferent about everything. ""I would give anything to see him, to hear his voice, to undo that day of 31 May. ""If I was to influence someone with my words, I would like them to think 10 times before they cause hurt to themselves and to other people."" The murder has also deeply affected the Essakhil family. Sadam's mother has returned to Afghanistan and his brother Ismail said he hopes he can achieve something through the film. ""He realised now whatever he has done is wrong. The only thing he's thinking now is getting his message to youngsters and not to make the same mistake that he made.""

"Young people are least likely to seek redress through employment tribunals About one in 20 workers does not get paid holidays, while one in 10 does not get a payslip, according to a report by the Resolution Foundation think tank. It found workers over the age of 65 are most likely to not have paid holidays, despite a legal entitlement to 28 days a year, or pro-rota for part-timers. And workers aged 25 and under are twice as likely to be underpaid the minimum wage that any other age group. The think tank says its findings reveal the extent of illegal labour practices. Workers in hotels and restaurants miss out out more than others on legal workplace entitlements, the report says. Meanwhile, those in small firms, employing fewer than 25, are most likely to not get payslips and paid leave, as are workers on zero-hours and temporary contracts, the Resolution Foundation said. The analysis was published to mark the start of the organisation's three-year investigation into the enforcement of labour market rules and regulations. Lindsay Judge, senior economic analyst at the Resolution Foundation, said: ""The UK has a multitude of rules to govern its labour market, from maximum hours to minimum pay, but these rules can only become a reality if they are properly enforced. ""Labour market violations remain far too common, with millions of workers missing out on basic entitlements to a payslip, holiday entitlement and the minimum wage. ""Our analysis suggests that, while violations take place across the labour market, the government should also prioritise investigations into sectors like hotels and restaurants, along with firms who make large use of atypical employment contracts, as that's where abuse is most prevalent,"" Ms Judge said. She welcomed the government's move to strengthen the resources and powers of bodies such as HM Revenue & Customs and the Gangmasters and Labour Abuse Agency. However, the UK still largely relies on individuals seeking redress through the Employment Tribunal (ET) system. And, she said, many of the individuals in most need of help to challenge illegal practices are those least likely to use ETs. Young people are disproportionately subjected to unlawful working practises, but make fewer ET applications than any other age group. In contrast, managerial staff are least likely to be subject to labour market abuse, but are among the most likely to be make tribunal claims. The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said it is committed to enforcing workplace regulations and tackling firms that break the rules, and is consulting on bringing agencies together under its proposed Single Enforcement Body. ""We are extending state enforcement to cover holiday pay for vulnerable workers, as part of the largest upgrade to workers' rights in a generation,"" said a spokesman. However, Shadow business minister Laura Pidcock said she recognised many people worked in illegal conditions, but insisted ""the Tories are on the side of the few, not the many"". ""Behind these statistics are many hours of stressful and exhausting work, people's home lives being made so much harder than they need to be, an unchecked class of bad bosses and legions of workers who feel like they have no choice but to accept illegal poor conditions,"" she said.

"This video can not be played The acceleration in melting of the ice sheet covering Greenland has shocked researchers Extreme events linked to climate change, such as the heatwave in Europe this year, are occurring sooner than expected, an ex-chief scientist says. Prof Sir David King says he's been scared by the number of extreme events, and he called for the UK to advance its climate targets by 10 years. But the UN's weather chief said using words like âscaredâ could make young people depressed and anxious. Campaigners argue that people won't act unless they feel fearful. Speaking to the BBC, Prof King, a former chief scientific adviser to the government, said: âItâs appropriate to be scared. We predicted temperatures would rise, but we didnât foresee these sorts of extreme events weâre getting so soon.â This video can not be played Five things the world needs to invest in to be ""climate change resilient"". He said the world had changed faster than generally predicted in the fifth assessment report from the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in 2014. He referred especially to the loss of land ice and sea ice, and to the weather extremes in which he said warming probably played a role. Several other scientists contacted by the BBC supported his emotive language. The physicist Prof Jo Haigh from Imperial College London said: âDavid King is right to be scared â Iâm scared too."" âWe do the analysis, we think whatâs going to happen, then publish in a very scientific way. ""Then we have a human response to thatâ¦ and it is scary.â UK commits to 'net zero' emissions by 2050 Climate change: Where we are in seven charts What is climate change? Petteri Taalas, the secretary-general of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), a specialised UN agency, said he fully supported United Nations climate goals, but he criticised radical green campaigners for forecasting the end of the world. Itâs the latest chapter in the long debate over how to communicate climate science to the public. This video can not be played Greta Thunberg sails into New York City Dr Taalas agrees polar ice is melting faster than expected, but heâs concerned that public fear could lead to paralysis â and also to mental health problems amongst the young. âWe are fully behind climate science and fully behind the (upcoming) New York climate summit"", he said. âBut I want to stick to the facts, which are quite convincing and dramatic enough. We should avoid interpreting them too much. âWhen I was young we were afraid of nuclear war. We seriously thought itâs better not to have children. âIâm feeling the same sentiment among young people at the moment. So we have to be a bit careful with our communication style.â He said most of the changes were within the IPCC forecast range - although some - like polar ice - were at the top end of the range. The polar scientist Andrew Shepherd, from Leeds University, agreed with that assessment. He also said scientists should normally avoid emotional terms: ""I  would not use the term (scary) in general, but it is certainly surprising to see record (or near record) losses of ice. 2019 has been a bad year for Earth's ice."" It seems though, that some scientists believe their communications in the past have been failing to provoke an emotional response that would convince the public to act. The Telegraph reports that psychologists working with the University of Bath arecounselling growing numbers of young people suffering from eco-anxiet,externaly. However, some scientists appear to believe that their communications in the past have been failing to provoke an emotional response that would convince the public to act. We tested Prof King's views with the main authors of the authoritative Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report (AR5), published in 2014. The consensus among those who replied was that climate models had accurately forecast the rise in global mean temperature. But the models hadnât been sufficiently sophisticated to foresee events like this yearâs extreme European heatwave or the slow-moving Hurricane Dorian âdescribed by Nasa,externalas âextraordinaryâ and âa nightmare scenarioâ. Others mentionedsevere ice melting at the poles; Tasmania suffering record droughts and floods in consecutive years;record wildfires in the Arcticand an unprecedentedtwo large cyclones in Mozambique,externalin one year. Gerald Meehl, a senior scientist at the US National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) in Boulder, Colorado, told us heâd been anticipating changes like these for four decades, although he hadn't been certain when they would arrive. âI have a sense of the numbing inevitability of it all,â he said. Few of the scientists we contacted had faith that governments would do what was needed to rescue the climate in time. Theyâre alarmed that global warming of just over 1C so far has already created a new normal in which historic temperature records will inevitably be broken more often. This is the predictable side of climate change. Prof King argues that some changes were not well forecast. The loss of land ice in Antarctica, for instance, is at the upper range of predictions in the IPCC AR5. And there are record ice losses in Greenland Then thereâs this yearâs French heatwave. Extreme and sustained temperatures in France in July led to droughts in some areas Dr Friederike Otto from Oxford University is an expert in the attribution of extreme events to climate change. She told us that in a pre-climate change world, a heatwave like this might strike once in 1,000 years. In a post-warming world, the heatwave was a one-in-a-100 year phenomenon. In other words, natural variability is amplifying human-induced climate heating. âWith European heatwaves, we have realised that climate change is a total game-changer,â she said. ""It has increased the likelihood (of events) by orders of magnitude."" Researchers had not yet had time to investigate the links between all of the major extreme weather events and climate change, she said. With some phenomena such as droughts and floods there was no clear evidence yet of any involvement from climate change. And it was impossible to be sure that the slow progress of Dorian was caused by climate change. Prof King said the world could not wait for scientific certainty on events like Hurricane Dorian. âScientists like to be certain,â he said. âBut these events are all about probabilities. What is the likelihood that (Dorian) is a climate change event? Iâm going to say âvery highâ. âI canât say that with 100% certainty, but what I can say is that the energy from the hurricane comes from the warm ocean and if that ocean gets warmer we must expect more energy in hurricanes.â He continued: âIf you got in a plane with a one in 100 chance of crashing you would be appropriately scared. âBut we are experimenting with the climate in a way that throws up probabilities of very severe consequences of much more than that.â Hurricane Dorian was packing sustained winds of 295km/h (185mph) when it made landfall Pierre Friedlingstein from Exeter University said he'd been surprised by the onslaught of extreme weather. He said he expected extremes to happen as forecast by the IPCC - but had not expected them so quickly. Prof King said the situation was so grave that the UK should bring forward its date for cutting emissions of greenhouse gases to almost zero from 2050 to 2040. Some of the IPCC scientists we contacted didnât share his urge to engage with the public on an emotional level. Others agreed with him. Prof John Church from the University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia told us: ""Some things appear to be happening faster than projected. This may be partially related to the interaction of climate change and natural variability as well as the uncertainty in our understanding and projections. âIn my own area of sea level change, things are happening near the upper end of the projections. âWhat is scary is our lack of appropriate response. Our continued lack of action is committing the world to major and essentially irreversible change.â Follow Rogeron Twitter.,external UK commits to 'net zero' emissions by 2050 Climate change: Where we are in seven charts Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser LA mayor says winds and drought created 'perfect storm', while official hits out at looters Maps and pictures chart how fires have spread Joe Biden says Jimmy Carter made a 'powerful difference' in funeral eulogy Why are UK borrowing costs rising and what does it mean for me?

"Peter Duncan's family described him as a ""devoted father and husband"" A 17-year-old boy has pleaded guilty to murdering a lawyer with a screwdriver. Peter Duncan was stabbed outside a  Greggs in Newcastle city centre's Eldon Square shopping centre on 14 August. The lawyer was ""in the wrong place at the wrong time"" when he was attacked, according to Northumbria Police. The boy, who cannot be named, appeared at Leeds Crown Court via video link and also admitted stealing screwdrivers and carrying an offensive weapon. He will be sentenced in December. A previous hearing was told the teenager had 17 convictions for 31 offences between 2017 and 2019. On one occasion he grabbed a knife during a family argument and on another he threatened a bus driver with a blade after he was challenged about drinking alcohol. Det Ch Insp Jane Fairlamb, from Northumbria Police, said the killing was ""shocking...a much-loved family man was murdered in an unprovoked attack"". At the previous hearing, the court was told 52-year-old Mr Duncan was ""simply in the wrong place at the wrong time"" when he crossed paths with the teenager who had a history of violence and carrying knives. Police cordoned off the entrance to Eldon Square close to where the stabbing occurred The pair came into contact at the entrance to the shopping centre when they were walking in opposite directions. The court was told the teenager was looking for another youth with whom he had previously argued about cigarettes. Mr Duncan raised his arm to let the youth past, but ""the defendant took exception to that"" and ""a struggle ensued"", prosecutor Kevin Wardlaw said. After pushing the youngster off, Mr Duncan was stabbed once through the heart and collapsed a short distance away. The attack was captured on CCTV, and cameras also tracked the teenager's movements through the city centre. Officers searched the area outside the shopping centre in the hunt for the murder weapon Mr Duncan was working as legal counsel in the Newcastle office of Royal IHC Limited, and previously as a solicitor and legal advisor with other companies in Darlington and Newcastle. He had trained as an electrical engineer before graduating from Northumbria University with a law degree in 2003. In a statement released following his death, Mr Duncan's family said he was a ""kind and caring man who was always first to help others"". ""His death will leave such a huge hole in our lives and he'll be deeply missed by us all,"" they added.

"Magpies are a common threat to cyclists around Australia An Australian man has died in a bicycle crash while trying to escape from a swooping magpie. The 76-year-old cyclist suffered head injuries on Sunday when he veered off a path and crashed into a park fence south of Sydney, police said. Despite paramedics' efforts to save him, the man later died in hospital. Swooping magpies are a common threat in Australia during spring and often cause injuries to cyclists and pedestrians, but fatal incidents are rare. Police said they would prepare a report for a coroner after the attack in Wollongong, New South Wales. Local media reported that several other magpie attacks had previously taken place in the park. The Australian magpie is a different species to the European bird with which it shares its name. During mating season, the bird can become aggressive and attack humans crossing its territory. Spring is the most active time for magpie attacks Earlier this month, a local Sydney council sparked controversy whenrangers shot dead a ""monster"" magpiewhich had intimidated residents for years. The ""particularly aggressive"" bird had attacked several people in the Hills Shire in the city's north-west, sending some to hospital. The magpie that saved a family Angry birds take aim at newlyweds One resident had also suffered a heart attack,externalfollowing a run-in with the bird, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation reported. Officials at the time defended their decision to kill the large magpie. The species is protected by law but can be dealt with by local authorities at their discretion.

"Aldi's profits fell 18% last year Aldi plans to open a new store in the UK every week on average for the next two years, its boss has told the BBC. Giles Hurley said the discount retailer would invest Â£1bn to achieve its aim. ""The reality is that almost 50% of the population of the UK doesn't currently shop with us and they tell us the main reason for that is that they don't have a store near us,"" he said. Aldi's pledge came as it reported a sales rise for last year, but saw profits fall sharply. Last year, the company attracted more than 800,000 new customers, adding an extra Â£1.1bn in sales, up 11% on the previous twelve months.  But most of this sales growth is from opening new stores. This video can not be played Aldi's Giles Hurley Profits for the same period fell 18%, partly due to price cuts aimed at keeping its competitive edge. Whilst the big established grocers are opening few, if any new stores, Aldi is still expanding, stealing their customers and growing market share. And that is set to continue. ""Over the next two years we're going to invest a further billion pounds in the UK and that shows our intent,"" says Mr Hurley, Aldi's chief executive for the UK and Ireland. Aldi plans to double the number of its stores within the M25 Aldi now has over 840 stores and is increasing its focus on London. It wants to double the number of stores inside the M25, from 45 to 100, by the end of 2025. ""Within Greater London, our market share is around half of what it is in the rest of the country so there's clearly a big opportunity for us to expand the business. In the long term, we can comfortably see us opening 200-250 stores within London,"" says Mr Hurley. But will they be able to find enough locations to fit their low-cost business model? ""It's not straightforward as you don't have the parking spaces,"" says Adam Leyland, editor of the Grocer magazine. ""It's also harder to get good sites in London. So you have to have a very flexible model and Aldi is so formulaic as a discounter that this is harder to manage. ""But they are determined to do it and they are a very capable grocer. We've seen over the years how they've responded to the dynamics of the UK market."" When Aldi opens a new store the shoppers come. Here in Ruabon, on the outskirts of Wrexham, customers were queuing round the block, lured by the promise of an early freebie. It felt like Black Friday had come early. The rush was on for the so called ""Aisle of Wonder"" - ""starbuys"" included a Â£24.99 cordless lawnmower and a cut price vacuum cleaner. Families were dragging six-seater wooden patio sets towards the tills. Another woman's trolley was filled with three Mr Potato Heads, four rabbit-shaped wicker planters and a wooden wishing well for her garden. The first customer, Ken Peters, had been waiting since 5:30am to get in: ""I'm hoping for a bargain, or a free food voucher,"" he says. Aldi is already experimenting with a new, smaller, convenience store format. There are currently eight Aldi ""Local"" stores in Greater London, including a former Waitrose store in Camden.  Aldi thinks that figure could grow to as high as 50 in the longer term. So how long can this rapid expansion last? ""The fundamental question for Aldi, Lidl and all the other discounters, like B&M, across the retail sectors is that at some point they will reach their peak physical space,"" says Patrick O'Brien, UK retail director at market research firm GlobalData. ""The rate of growth they're enjoying isn't going to last forever. ""So they're going to be in the same boat as their bigger rivals, going head to head for their share of the spend in their existing store estates, and as the discounters have expanded they are more often found in each other's catchment areas, competing with each other rather than the easier job of taking spend from higher priced rivals,"" he believes. Aldi says keeping prices low has hit its profits But that's not something Aldi has to worry about right now when it's got years of growth ahead to manage, argues Mr Leyland. ""Aldi are clearly performing very well. The crucial thing is that when they open a store people come. Aldi will only have a problem if it opens new stores and people aren't attracted to them and I can't see any evidence of that."" But the Big Four supermarket chains aren't making it easy. They've been improving their offer and trying to close the price gap with the discounters. Aldi's promise to keep prices lower took its toll on last year's profits. But Mr Hurley, is adamant that it's a promise he's prepared to keep: ""Our profits did suffer as a result of the investments we made, but Aldi is not like other supermarkets. We take a very long-term view of our business and the focus is very much on our sales, our customers and our store numbers and not on short term profitability. ""The plans we put down last year were carefully considered. We've always said that we will offer the lowest prices in the market,"" he says. Ahead of Brexit, Aldi is stocking up on items which aren't produced in the UK The biggest challenge right now for all the UK's grocers is Brexit. So does Aldi believe there will be gaps on the shelves in the event of a disorderly no deal? ""I can't guarantee the availability of every single product,"" says Mr Hurley. ""But actually that's no different from anyone else. What we will do is shield our customers from as many ripple effects as possible. I can't commit that prices won't go up. I'm not alone in the industry on that but what I can guarantee is that customers will always pay the lowest grocery prices with Aldi."" Mr Hurely said the chain was working ""very closely"" with its supply base. ""Because of our select range of products that's probably a little easier than some of our competitors. ""We also believe we're in a solid position because 75% of what we sell comes from British suppliers and manufacturers"", he says. Aldi is increasing stocks in items like olive oil, tinned tomatoes and pasta, items which aren't produced in the UK. Brexit, says the Grocer's Mr Leyland, is Aldi's biggest worry right now. ""It's the biggest challenge for the whole food industry at the moment. Everyone is working crazily to come up with solutions. ""Aldi may have fewer products to worry about but it's a double-edged sword because if one product isn't getting through it's harder to flex it. And although they're very competitive, they've struggled to manage inflation like everyone else."" Whatever happens, Aldi is clear that Brexit won't change its expansion plans. This business, along with Lidl, has had a profound effect on the UK grocery market. Aldi alone took Â£7bn of sales in the last year that would otherwise have gone to its rivals, according to the research, data and insight consultancy, Kantar. As long as it is continuing to open new stores, it's likely to be a hugely disruptive force.

"One of the US government's satellite images showing apparent damage at the world's biggest oil-processing facility The United States has issued satellite images and cited intelligence to back its allegation Iran was behind attacks on major Saudi oil facilities. Iran denies involvement in Saturday's air attacks, which were claimed by Iran-aligned Houthi rebels in Yemen. But unnamed US officials speaking to US and international media say the direction and extent of the attacks cast doubt on Houthi involvement. The incident has cut global oil supplies by 5% and prices have soared. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo blamed Iran at the weekend, without providing any evidence, prompting Tehran to accuse Washington of deceit. Images show detail of attacks on Saudi oil sites The huge US oil stash hidden in underground caves Tweeting on Sunday, President Donald Trump stopped short of directly accusing Iran, but suggested possible military action once the perpetrator was known.

Unnamed US officials have been speaking to the New York Times, ABC and Reuters. One official said there were 19 points of impact on the targets and the attacks had come from a west-north-west direction - not Houthi-controlled territory in Yemen, which lies to the south-west of the Saudi oil facilities. The officials said that could suggest launch sites in the northern Gulf, Iran or Iraq. A Saudi-led coalition fighting in Yemen has accused Iran of providing the weapons. Attack on Saudis destabilises already volatile region Iran-US tensions: What's going on? Why Saudi Arabia and Iran are bitter rivals A close-up image of damaged tanks at the Abqaiq processing plant (included above) appeared to show impact points on the western side. Other images seem to show damage at the Khurais oilfield, which is located further west. Iraq denied at the weekend that the attacks were launched from its territory. Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi said Mr Pompeo had assured him in a phone call on Monday that the US backed Iraq's position. Officials quoted by the New York Times said a mix of drones and cruise missiles,externalmight have been deployed, but that not all had hit their targets at Abqaiq and Khurais. China and the European Union have, separately, urged restraint. UN Yemen envoy Martin Griffiths told the Security Council on Monday it was ""not entirely clear"" who was behind the strike but he said it had increased the chances of a regional conflict. In the UK, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab also said it was not yet clear who was responsible, but called the act a ""wanton violation of international law"". The oil price has seen the biggest one-day rise since the 1991 Gulf War, rising 20% but falling back later. The international benchmark used by traders, Brent crude, jumped to $71.95 (Â£57.53) a barrel at one point. Prices eased after President Trump authorised a possible release of US reserves. US Energy Secretary Rick Perry told business channel CNBC thatit was too early to tell if this would be necessary,external.  He also blamed Iran for the attack. There are concerns that higher prices could continue if tensions worsen further. Oil prices soar after attacks on Saudi facilities Earlier Mr Perry insisted the oil market ""is resilient and will respond positively"". Iranian Foreign MinisterJavad Zarif tweeted on Sunday to deride Mr Pompeo,external, saying that ""having failed at max pressure, Sec Pompeo's turning to max deceit"". This video can not be played Abqaiq has the world's largest oil processing plant He was referring to the Trump administration's stated ""maximum pressure campaign"", which has targeted Iran with sanctions since Washington pulled out of an international agreement to limit the scope of Iran's nuclear programme. The attacks targeted Abqaiq, the site of the world's largest oil processing plant, run by the Saudi state oil company, Aramco, and the Khurais oilfield. Khurais is the closest of the targets to the Yemen border - still a considerable 770km (480 miles) away. Smoke billowing from the oil facility in Abqaiq Saudi Arabia said drones had carried out the attacks, which began at 04:00 (01:00 GMT) and sent huge clouds of thick, black smoke into the air. The Houthi movement said its forces had sent 10 drones towards the facilities and have since warned of further attacks. There were no reports of injuries, but the extent of the damage to the facilities is still not entirely clear. WhySaudi Arabia and Iranare bitter rivals Saudi Arabia and Iran are locked in a fierce struggle for regional dominance. The decades-old feud is exacerbated by religious differences. They each follow one of the two main branches of Islam - Iran is largely Shia Muslim, while Saudi Arabia sees itself as the leading Sunni Muslim power. The two countries are not directly fighting but they are engaged in a variety of proxy wars (conflicts where they support rival sides and militias) around the region. Saudi Arabia is fighting against the rebel Houthi movement in neighbouring Yemen, in part to stem perceived Iranian influence there. Iran has denied accusations that it is supporting the Houthis militarily, though successive reports from a panel of UN experts have demonstrated significant assistance for the Houthis from Tehran in terms of both technology and weaponry. Read more about Saudi-Iranian relations The Houthis have repeatedly launched rockets, missiles and drones at populated areas in Saudi Arabia. The attacks have left at least four civilians dead. The Yemen conflict escalated in March 2015, when the Houthis seized control of much of the west of the country and forced President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi to flee abroad. Saudi Arabia and allies then began an air campaign aimed at restoring Mr Hadi's government. The UN says the conflict has claimed the lives of at least 7,290 civilians and left 80% of the population - 24 million people - in need of humanitarian assistance or protection, including 10 million who rely on food aid to survive.

"Young people are least likely to seek redress through employment tribunals About one in 20 workers does not get paid holidays, while one in 10 does not get a payslip, according to a report by the Resolution Foundation think tank. It found workers over the age of 65 are most likely to not have paid holidays, despite a legal entitlement to 28 days a year, or pro-rota for part-timers. And workers aged 25 and under are twice as likely to be underpaid the minimum wage that any other age group. The think tank says its findings reveal the extent of illegal labour practices. Workers in hotels and restaurants miss out out more than others on legal workplace entitlements, the report says. Meanwhile, those in small firms, employing fewer than 25, are most likely to not get payslips and paid leave, as are workers on zero-hours and temporary contracts, the Resolution Foundation said. The analysis was published to mark the start of the organisation's three-year investigation into the enforcement of labour market rules and regulations. Lindsay Judge, senior economic analyst at the Resolution Foundation, said: ""The UK has a multitude of rules to govern its labour market, from maximum hours to minimum pay, but these rules can only become a reality if they are properly enforced. ""Labour market violations remain far too common, with millions of workers missing out on basic entitlements to a payslip, holiday entitlement and the minimum wage. ""Our analysis suggests that, while violations take place across the labour market, the government should also prioritise investigations into sectors like hotels and restaurants, along with firms who make large use of atypical employment contracts, as that's where abuse is most prevalent,"" Ms Judge said. She welcomed the government's move to strengthen the resources and powers of bodies such as HM Revenue & Customs and the Gangmasters and Labour Abuse Agency. However, the UK still largely relies on individuals seeking redress through the Employment Tribunal (ET) system. And, she said, many of the individuals in most need of help to challenge illegal practices are those least likely to use ETs. Young people are disproportionately subjected to unlawful working practises, but make fewer ET applications than any other age group. In contrast, managerial staff are least likely to be subject to labour market abuse, but are among the most likely to be make tribunal claims. The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said it is committed to enforcing workplace regulations and tackling firms that break the rules, and is consulting on bringing agencies together under its proposed Single Enforcement Body. ""We are extending state enforcement to cover holiday pay for vulnerable workers, as part of the largest upgrade to workers' rights in a generation,"" said a spokesman. However, Shadow business minister Laura Pidcock said she recognised many people worked in illegal conditions, but insisted ""the Tories are on the side of the few, not the many"". ""Behind these statistics are many hours of stressful and exhausting work, people's home lives being made so much harder than they need to be, an unchecked class of bad bosses and legions of workers who feel like they have no choice but to accept illegal poor conditions,"" she said.

"This video can not be played What is ""county lines""? Gang members are enrolling in universities and masquerading as students in order to sell drugs in new cities, an academic has warned. Dr Mohammed Qasim said dealers fromcounty lines drug gangsbecome students to give themselves an alibi in case they are searched by the police. ""It's not hard to get in university... it gives them a reason to be in the city,"" said the drugs gang expert. Police said drug gangs were becoming ""more sophisticated"" to avoid arrest. More than100 county lines gangs are operating across Wales, according to the National Crime Agency, with drug bosses pulling the strings mainly from London, Birmingham and Liverpool. What is County Lines? Why Wales has been hit so hard by County Lines Authorities think the county lines network started in 2015 - cocaine deaths in Wales are more than four times higher than five years ago, with 31 last year. Heroin and morphine deaths have almost trebled since county lines started, to 108 in 2018. This video can not be played ""We're drowning in street drugs and it'll get worse"" Dr Qasim, who interviewed members of a county lines gang in Swansea as part of his research, said dealers were hiding behind the ""student image"". He added that living among students helped ethnic minority gang members to blend into predominantly white areas of south and west Wales. ""The dealers now have to have an alibi as to why they're moving 200 miles from one place to another,"" said Dr Qasim, a researcher on ethnic minority gangs at Leeds Beckett University. ""They'll live amongst students so they won't be noticed so much. ""If you're from an ethnic minority background there are some parts of Swansea, for example, where you'll stand out, so you need to live in areas where there's other ethnic minority groups. ""It's not hard to get into university - universities will take people through clearing. They won't actually go to university to study, it's just a reason to be in a particular place."" Dr Mohammed Qasim infiltrated a county lines gang in Swansea as part of his research The organisation that represents colleges in Wales said they work with authorities to ""meet any challenges county lines gangs might pose"", while universities are not commenting. Dr Qasim met young county lines drug runners working out of a ""really nice flat"" in Swansea earlier this year and they wanted to set up their own ""franchise"" running drugs to Aberystwyth. ""One was kicked out of school, he didn't have much going on in his life in London but in Swansea he was making money,"" he said. ""He was away from gang crime, he'd been given a flat. I'd imagine you pay Â£1,100 a month in the city for a flat like that. ""He had five or six people living in a one bedroom flat back in London, so living in this apartment here was like heaven. ""These were victims of exploitation from older gang members. They put them into these cities, sell them the dream that they can make money and eventually set up their own operations."" This 47-year-old addict gets his drugs from county lines dealers ""When the English guys first appeared on the scene, we didn't like it. We're proud Welsh and I didn't like buying from them at all. ""We were really angry about them bringing crack into the area. We didn't have that here before and it's so destructive for people - they just don't care. ""The people I dealt with were Birmingham youngsters but I didn't like having to pick up off 17-year-olds - I'm 45. ""I know a couple that tried to rip them off and steal from them and this boy just pulled a machete - you could see from the look in his eye he would have taken their arm off if they'd gone for the drugs."" Police say young runners, often victims of child exploitation, are told by dealers to swallow the drugs to transport around the county as it is more difficult for officers to carry internal searches on children. ""That's partly to make the police response more difficult as we don't want to be keeping young people in detention longer than necessary,"" said Det Insp Paul Stanley of British Transport Police. ""And partly to reduce the risk of them being located."" Dealers are said to operate a ""marketing machine"" and offer credit to addicts in order to lure them into taking drugs. County lines drug dealers text potential customers offering cut-price deals on heroin and crack cocaine County lines gangs have a widespread marketing network, texting potential customers offering cut-price deals on heroin and crack cocaine. ""We see guys in treatment who are trying really hard to move away from the scene but you literally have people knocking on their doors,"" said Carly Jones ofdrug awareness organisation PSALT,external. ""We always say to people in treatment is get rid of your phone, change your number, get a fresh start. ""We have tens of people saying that's what they did, but within two weeks they have someone knocking on their door saying here's Â£50 credit on us, trying to hook them back in.

"This video can not be played The acceleration in melting of the ice sheet covering Greenland has shocked researchers Extreme events linked to climate change, such as the heatwave in Europe this year, are occurring sooner than expected, an ex-chief scientist says. Prof Sir David King says he's been scared by the number of extreme events, and he called for the UK to advance its climate targets by 10 years. But the UN's weather chief said using words like âscaredâ could make young people depressed and anxious. Campaigners argue that people won't act unless they feel fearful. Speaking to the BBC, Prof King, a former chief scientific adviser to the government, said: âItâs appropriate to be scared. We predicted temperatures would rise, but we didnât foresee these sorts of extreme events weâre getting so soon.â This video can not be played Five things the world needs to invest in to be ""climate change resilient"". He said the world had changed faster than generally predicted in the fifth assessment report from the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in 2014. He referred especially to the loss of land ice and sea ice, and to the weather extremes in which he said warming probably played a role. Several other scientists contacted by the BBC supported his emotive language. The physicist Prof Jo Haigh from Imperial College London said: âDavid King is right to be scared â Iâm scared too."" âWe do the analysis, we think whatâs going to happen, then publish in a very scientific way. ""Then we have a human response to thatâ¦ and it is scary.â UK commits to 'net zero' emissions by 2050 Climate change: Where we are in seven charts What is climate change? Petteri Taalas, the secretary-general of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), a specialised UN agency, said he fully supported United Nations climate goals, but he criticised radical green campaigners for forecasting the end of the world. Itâs the latest chapter in the long debate over how to communicate climate science to the public. This video can not be played Greta Thunberg sails into New York City Dr Taalas agrees polar ice is melting faster than expected, but heâs concerned that public fear could lead to paralysis â and also to mental health problems amongst the young. âWe are fully behind climate science and fully behind the (upcoming) New York climate summit"", he said. âBut I want to stick to the facts, which are quite convincing and dramatic enough. We should avoid interpreting them too much. âWhen I was young we were afraid of nuclear war. We seriously thought itâs better not to have children. âIâm feeling the same sentiment among young people at the moment. So we have to be a bit careful with our communication style.â He said most of the changes were within the IPCC forecast range - although some - like polar ice - were at the top end of the range. The polar scientist Andrew Shepherd, from Leeds University, agreed with that assessment. He also said scientists should normally avoid emotional terms: ""I  would not use the term (scary) in general, but it is certainly surprising to see record (or near record) losses of ice. 2019 has been a bad year for Earth's ice."" It seems though, that some scientists believe their communications in the past have been failing to provoke an emotional response that would convince the public to act. The Telegraph reports that psychologists working with the University of Bath arecounselling growing numbers of young people suffering from eco-anxiet,externaly. However, some scientists appear to believe that their communications in the past have been failing to provoke an emotional response that would convince the public to act. We tested Prof King's views with the main authors of the authoritative Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report (AR5), published in 2014. The consensus among those who replied was that climate models had accurately forecast the rise in global mean temperature. But the models hadnât been sufficiently sophisticated to foresee events like this yearâs extreme European heatwave or the slow-moving Hurricane Dorian âdescribed by Nasa,externalas âextraordinaryâ and âa nightmare scenarioâ. Others mentionedsevere ice melting at the poles; Tasmania suffering record droughts and floods in consecutive years;record wildfires in the Arcticand an unprecedentedtwo large cyclones in Mozambique,externalin one year. Gerald Meehl, a senior scientist at the US National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) in Boulder, Colorado, told us heâd been anticipating changes like these for four decades, although he hadn't been certain when they would arrive. âI have a sense of the numbing inevitability of it all,â he said. Few of the scientists we contacted had faith that governments would do what was needed to rescue the climate in time. Theyâre alarmed that global warming of just over 1C so far has already created a new normal in which historic temperature records will inevitably be broken more often. This is the predictable side of climate change. Prof King argues that some changes were not well forecast. The loss of land ice in Antarctica, for instance, is at the upper range of predictions in the IPCC AR5. And there are record ice losses in Greenland Then thereâs this yearâs French heatwave. Extreme and sustained temperatures in France in July led to droughts in some areas Dr Friederike Otto from Oxford University is an expert in the attribution of extreme events to climate change. She told us that in a pre-climate change world, a heatwave like this might strike once in 1,000 years. In a post-warming world, the heatwave was a one-in-a-100 year phenomenon. In other words, natural variability is amplifying human-induced climate heating. âWith European heatwaves, we have realised that climate change is a total game-changer,â she said. ""It has increased the likelihood (of events) by orders of magnitude."" Researchers had not yet had time to investigate the links between all of the major extreme weather events and climate change, she said. With some phenomena such as droughts and floods there was no clear evidence yet of any involvement from climate change. And it was impossible to be sure that the slow progress of Dorian was caused by climate change. Prof King said the world could not wait for scientific certainty on events like Hurricane Dorian. âScientists like to be certain,â he said. âBut these events are all about probabilities. What is the likelihood that (Dorian) is a climate change event? Iâm going to say âvery highâ. âI canât say that with 100% certainty, but what I can say is that the energy from the hurricane comes from the warm ocean and if that ocean gets warmer we must expect more energy in hurricanes.â He continued: âIf you got in a plane with a one in 100 chance of crashing you would be appropriately scared. âBut we are experimenting with the climate in a way that throws up probabilities of very severe consequences of much more than that.â Hurricane Dorian was packing sustained winds of 295km/h (185mph) when it made landfall Pierre Friedlingstein from Exeter University said he'd been surprised by the onslaught of extreme weather. He said he expected extremes to happen as forecast by the IPCC - but had not expected them so quickly. Prof King said the situation was so grave that the UK should bring forward its date for cutting emissions of greenhouse gases to almost zero from 2050 to 2040. Some of the IPCC scientists we contacted didnât share his urge to engage with the public on an emotional level. Others agreed with him. Prof John Church from the University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia told us: ""Some things appear to be happening faster than projected. This may be partially related to the interaction of climate change and natural variability as well as the uncertainty in our understanding and projections. âIn my own area of sea level change, things are happening near the upper end of the projections. âWhat is scary is our lack of appropriate response. Our continued lack of action is committing the world to major and essentially irreversible change.â Follow Rogeron Twitter.,external UK commits to 'net zero' emissions by 2050 Climate change: Where we are in seven charts Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser LA mayor says winds and drought created 'perfect storm', while official hits out at looters Maps and pictures chart how fires have spread Joe Biden says Jimmy Carter made a 'powerful difference' in funeral eulogy Why are UK borrowing costs rising and what does it mean for me?

"Almost Â£2m was raised to give the items a permanent home in Edinburgh - but the Church of Scotland wants a share The Church of Scotland is suing for a share of a Â£2m Viking treasure trove which was unearthed on land it owns in Dumfries and Galloway. Legal action has been filed at the Court of Session in Edinburgh against metal detectorist Derek McLennan, who found the hoard in 2014. The National Museum of Scotland paid almost Â£2m for the items, which aredue to tour Scotland in the next two years. The Kirk said it was entitled to an equitable share of the find. The hoard, consisting of gold and silver objects, was discovered in 2014 in Galloway by Mr McLennan from Ayrshire. Derek McLennan made the find in Dumfriesshire in 2014 A retired businessman and amateur detectorist, Mr McLennan had been given permission by the church to search the area. At the time he said: ""I unearthed the first piece, initially I didn't understand what I had found because I thought it was a silver spoon and then I turned it over and wiped my thumb across it and I saw the Saltire-type of design and knew instantly it was Viking. ""Then my senses exploded, I went into shock, endorphins flooded my system and away I went stumbling towards my colleagues waving it in the air."" A Church of Scotland spokesperson said: ""We can confirm that The General Trustees of the Church of Scotland have raised an action against Derek McLennan. ""As that is now a matter before the court it would be inappropriate for us to provide any further commentary at this time."" The items were unearthed in Galloway five years ago Earlier this year funding was secured to put the items found on show in Edinburgh before they go on tour to Kirkcudbright, Aberdeen and Dundee in 2020. Once the tour is completed the items will go onlong-term display at the National Museum of Scotlandin Edinburgh. A ""significant and representative portion"" will also be shared with the new Kirkcudbright Galleries.
