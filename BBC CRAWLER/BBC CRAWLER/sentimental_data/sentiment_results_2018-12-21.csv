"US stocks suffered one of the worst weekly falls in a decade as trade tensions with China, interest rate rises and a possible government shutdown rattled markets. All three indexes closed lower, with the technology-focused Nasdaq down 20% since its peak, placing it in so-called ""bear market"" territory. The Dow Jones Industrial Average recorded its biggest weekly drop in percentage terms since 2008. The S&P 500 fell 7% for the week. It is the biggest weekly percentage drop since August 2011 while the Nasdaq's 8.36% decline is the sharpest since November 2008. The Dow Jones fell 6.8% during the week. What's knocked markets off course? US economy under Trump: Is it the best in history? After years of gains, US investors are fleeing stocks, worried about a range of factors likely to hit corporate profits, including slowing economic growth domestically and abroad. Earlier this week, the US Federal Reserve lifted the interest rate and signalled that it would continue to rise next year, albeit at a slower pace. The Fed also cut its forecasts for economic growth in 2019 to 2.3%, down from the 2.5% predicted in September. Michael Hewson, chief markets analyst at CMC Markets, said: ""China is cooling and the eurozone is slowing down, and some of the economic indicators from the US have been a bit soft recently, but yet the Fed hiked rates and suggested that two more interest rate hikes were lined up for 2019."" Elliot Clarke, economist at Westpac, the banking group, added: ""Political brinkmanship in Washingtonis further heightening market uncertainty."" Markets were also unnerved by comments from President Donald Trump's trade adviser Peter Navarro who told the Nikkei newspaper that it would be ""difficult"" for the US and China to reach a long lasting trade agreement that would end the tensions between the two. Share trading started Friday on an upswing, boosted by stronger-than-expected quarterly sales at sportswear giant Nike. Investors also appeared soothed after John Williams, president and chief executive of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York said the central bank would consider market turmoil as it weighs future interest rate decisions. Facebook's stock was one of the biggest fallers on Friday However, selling set in by afternoon with some of the major technology firms - that led the market's rally earlier this year - experiencing some of the most bruising falls. Facebook and Twitter both tumbled more than 6%, Amazon dropped more than 5%, and Apple and Microsoft slipped more than 3%. For the day,  the Nasdaq index fell almost 3%, the S&P 500 tumbled more than 2%, and the Dow slid 1.8%. Some economists argue that the steep Wall Street sell-off does not reflect conditions in the wider economy, which grew at an annual pace of 3.4% in the most recent quarter. Consumer sentiment also remains strong, according to the most recent data. However, the fears on Wall Street could spread in the event of a prolonged downturn, analysts warned. ""If these expectations begin to shift, then we would expect to see more downward pressure on sentiment and spending patterns in early 2019,""  Oxford Economics said.

"Kathy Griffin has criticised the lack of women onForbes magazine's latest list,externalof the world's best-paid comedians. The Emmy Award-winning comediantweeted the top 10 of Forbes' list,externalalong with the words: ""No Women."" Jerry Seinfeld topped the rankings with estimated earnings of $57.5m (Â£45.3m). Amy Schumer was the first woman to make the list last year but has dropped back out this time. Ricky Gervais is the only British comedian on the list. He is a new entry in fifth place with earnings of $25m (Â£19.7m). Forbes said that was thanks to Humanity, his first stand-up tour for five years. Humanity was also on Netflix, and he has signed up for another Netflix special. Griffin, meanwhile, was unlikely to make the list herself. She was fired by CNN and said she lost a number of other jobs after sheposed with a fake decapitated head of President Donald Trumpin May 2017. Jerry Seinfeld and Kevin Hart are in first and second places Another comedian missing from the list is Louis CK, who was in last year's top 10 with $52m (Â£41m) earnings. But after heconfirmed sexual misconduct allegations against himin November 2017, his second Netflix special was cancelled and he has only performed ahandful of dates since. Seinfeld has topped the list in all but one year since it was first compiled in 2006. Kevin Hart took the top spot in 2016. Forbes attributes Seinfeld's earnings this year to his 2017 Netflix deal and Hulu's streaming rights to all nine seasons of Seinfeld, as well as more than $30m (Â£23.6m) from stand-up. Hart is close behind in second place with $57m (Â£44.9m). The comedian, who recentlypulled out of hosting the Oscarsdue to controversy over homophobic tweets, also earned more than $30m from touring and starred in the Jumanji film remake.

"Gatwick's runway has now reopened but police are yet to find the drone operator Passengers waiting at Gatwick airport for flights abroad say they are frustrated and upset that Christmas plans have been ruined by rogue drones being flown over the runway. About 140 flights have been cancelled, leaving hundreds of thousands of passengers unable to leave the country and others unable to get home. Lauran O'Neill says her daughter Emeli ""cried all day"" after their trip to Finland to see Santa was cancelled Lauran O'Neill and her family were due to fly to Finland to see Santa, huskies, reindeer and the Northern Lights. The nurse, from Harrow in London, and her husband Alex Tran, saved all year for the trip to Saariselka. ""We saved all year for this family trip. We will receive no compensation for flights and insurance is difficult as Finnair did not officially cancel the flight. ""I was not doing physical Christmas gifts as this was going to be the experience of a lifetime for my children. ""The whole family is devastated and my kids have been inconsolable. My five-year old daughter Emeli said Santa must not exist to have all these children crying. ""She came home and threw his invite letter in the bin. ""We have worked overtime for the last four months to give them [this trip] and to have that dissipate is so unfair for them. Emeli cried for the whole day when she found out. ""We are trying to cobble things together to make Christmas not so bad and our family and friends have been amazing.""

""I'm grateful that they cancelled all the flights because I wouldn't want to be on a flight when there is some sort of threat. ""Who knows what could be inside a drone?

She struck up a friendship with fellow Swede Linnea Stromberg, 22, from Stockholm, whose Gatwick-bound flight from New York ended up being diverted to Doncaster. ""We landed in Doncaster which was a tiny little airport and they seemed surprised there when such a big plane landed. ""But they dealt with it quite well and then they put us on a bus to Gatwick. I came here at 18:00 on Thursday. ""I waited in line until 22:00 then camped out by the Christmas tree. ""A year ago I was due to fly through Heathrow and they shut it due to the weather, so I probably won't fly through London next Christmas. ""I understand that this seems like a big deal out of nothing but there was nothing really else the airport authorities could do. ""If I get on my flight, I will be grateful.""

Ms Grech, who has type 1 diabetes, adrenal insufficiency, Sheehan's syndrome and sleep apnoea, said she will be missing Christmas with her family in East Sussex. ""I'm desperately trying to get back to see my son for Christmas,"" she says. ""We were in the Dominican on my bucket list holiday as I don't know if I can fly long haul again due to medical issues."" She is trying to find out if she can source more medication while abroad, but added: ""Thank god I brought enough insulin, growth hormone and life-saving steroids and emergency injections.""

"Host families waited at Gatwick airport on Friday to welcome the slightly delayed group of children A group of children affected by the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster have defied the Gatwick chaos and landed in the UK in time for Christmas. Host families were at the airport to welcome 30 children, who live in areas of Belarus contaminated with radiation. The children, aged between seven and 12, will now enjoy two weeks of respite and play, thanks to the Friends of Chernobyl's Children charity. They feared it might be scrapped when drone activity closed the airport. The children travelled to Minsk airport on Friday morning, hoping their flight would not be cancelled Volunteer Sue Platts said: ""Anya, the little girl I'm hosting, is so excited to put the Christmas tree up. She's been waiting since August to do it. It would have been heartbreaking it they missed this break,"" Ms Platts began to worry on Wednesday that the flight from Minsk, in Belarus, would be cancelled as hundreds of flights were affected. Drones, groans and can't-get-homes How can a drone caused so much chaos How countries counter the drone threat But when Gatwick re-opened on Friday morning, Ms Platts and other families gathered in Santa hats in the arrivals lounge to welcome the children just a few hours after their original scheduled arrival time. ""These children have been coming to us for five years or more, so we have strong bonds with them,"" Ms Platts said. Anya, 11, lives in Mogilev, Belarus, with her grandparents The trips, which take place in summer and at Christmas, give 300-350 children living in areas suffering the economic and social impact of the nuclear disaster the chance to have a holiday abroad. ""Many have no running water or proper sanitation at home, living in wooden homes or high-rise flats with several generations in a couple of rooms,"" Ms Platts added. ""One of the most exciting things for them is having a hot bath."" The Christmas visit is funded by volunteers, who pay for flights and visas, after the children visit in the summer for English lessons, dental treatment - paid for by the dentists themselves - and fun activities, such as going to the zoo. While in the UK, they enjoy clean air, fresh water and a good diet in contrast with their food at home, which might be contaminated. Sue, with Anya (left) and Katrina, who is on the same programme ""For them, it means two weeks of creature comforts of living at home. And it's Christmas - every child loves a party."" Around 200,000 sq km (77,000 sq miles) of land - 71% of which are in Belarus, Russia and Ukraine - were contaminated with radiation after a series of explosions in one of the reactors at the nuclear plant. Some new-borns in a region close to Ukraine's border still have serious deformities, while an unusually high rate of people have rare forms of cancer,according to charity Bridges to Belarus. There were other heart-warming stories among the thousands of tales of disrupted or cancelled journeys. University student Rebecca Bradley, 20, was comforted by home-made mince pies offered by a pilot when her flight home from Canada was diverted to Glasgow. The annoyance of a long wait was alleviated by a pilot's offer of mince pies ""He said to take a few because I might get hungry while waiting,"" she said. ""We wished each other good luck on our travels and a happy Christmas. The mince pies were fruity and spicy with crumbly pastry - delicious,"" Ms Bradley added.

"Police say they are still searching for those responsible for the unprecedented disruption at Gatwick Airport. But the drones that were flown over the airfield have not been captured and have not been seen since Thursday night. Endangering the safety of an aircraft is a criminal offence that can carry a prison sentence. So how will police find those responsible? If the drones were being operated by a typical remote control unit, it would be possible to establish the controller's position. Police could pick up the controller's radio signal and ""drive around and look where the signals are coming from"", said cyber-security expert Prof Alan Woodward from the University of Surrey. That would only be possible if the drones were being controlled by somebody in the area, which Prof Woodward thinks is a likely scenario. Police have suggested that the operator moved when officers got close, which points to ""someone in a van"". Police helicopters have been searching for the drone operator A drone was seen so regularly that somebody must have been changing its batteries. Unless, of course, there was more than one drone. However, there have been no sightings since Thursday night. If the operator has fled, there will be no signals to track. Drones and their controllers emit radio signals, which the police can capture and analyse. While Prof Woodward says there is ""not much forensic information in the signals"", there are ""some identifiers"" in them. This lets two drones work next to each other without signal interference - and could let police identify the drone or controller used, if they managed to record them. It is also possible the drone operator was not at the airport and was controlling the devices over the internet. If a drone was receiving its instructions using a mobile data connection, the network operators may be able to provide useful information. If they were able to locate a device switching between mobile masts as it flew over the airfield, they may be able to identify the account holder. But Prof Woodward says this would require a lot of technical knowledge, and thinks it is less likely that the drone was remotely controlled this way. The police have not managed to capture a drone. Now the operator has gone, the ""evidence has gone with them"", says Prof Woodward. If one reappears, they could ""follow it with another drone"", although there have already been helicopters flying around the airfield looking for people. The police have also appealed for any photos or videos the public have managed to capture of the drones.  They could reveal whether the device is off-the-shelf or custom-made. How countries counter the drone threat How can a drone cause so much chaos? Fighting back against rogue drones Beyond that, police will be searching Gatwick CCTV - both in the airport and the surrounding area. ""Gatwick Airport has a lot of CCTV inside the perimeter and on the edge looking outwards. But outside the airport it's quite a rural area, so I doubt there will be that much CCTV around,"" said Prof Woodward. It could be like looking for a ""needle in a haystack"", he warns.

"As drones become more popular, countries will need to consider regulations to restrict usage Gatwick Airport re-opened its runway on Friday morning after hundreds of flights were grounded due to a drones being spotted over the airfield on Wednesday and Thursday. So why has a drone caused so much disruption and what are the risks posed by these devices? The term ""drone"" for some prompts images of air strikes - but the sophisticated flying robots used on the battlefield are unlikely to be what we are talking about here. The vast majority of unmanned aerial vehicles are actually small, remote-controlled quadcopters used by hobbyists and photographers. These small devices are now a mainstream gadget, which can cost from under Â£40 to several thousands of pounds. Drones are also increasingly being used in industries such as construction and retail. Gatwick runway reopens after drone chaos In October 2017, a drone collided with a commercial aircraft in Canada, striking one of the plane's wings. The plane sustained minor damage but was able to land safely. Experts agree that a drone could damage an aircraft Research on drone damage to aircraft is still limited but a number of  institutions have tested a variety of impact scenarios and each seems to reach a different conclusion. Tests conducted at the University of Dayton,externalin the US mimicked a midair collision between a 2.1lb (1kg) quadcopter and a commercial aircraft travelling at 238mph (383km/h) and appeared to show it inflicting major damage. Other research from,externalthe Alliance for System Safety of Unmanned aircraft system through research Excellence (Assure) in conjunction with the US's Federal Aviation Authority suggested drones could inflict more damage than a bird collision and the lithium ion batteries that power them may not shatter upon impact, instead becoming lodged in airframes and posing a potential risk of fire. Ravi Vaidyanathan, a robotics lecturer at Imperial College, London, told the BBC: ""The threat posed to larger aircraft by drones is small but not negligible. ""The probability of a collision is small but a drone could be drawn into a turbine. ""A drone greater than 2kg might break the cockpit windshield as well for certain aircraft."" Martin Lanni, chief executive of airspace security company Quantum Aviation, said: ""A drone looks quite fragile but the battery is hefty and if you compare a drone  to a bird, then it could be potentially more dangerous if it goes through the engine or hits the fuselage."" According to the UK Airprox Board, there were 92 instances of aircraft and drones coming close to colliding in 2017. Fighting back against rogue drones Drones ground flights at Gatwick Drone collides with commercial aeroplane in Canada There were 92 instances of aircraft and drones coming close to colliding reported in 2017 In the UK, legislation came into force in July, making it illegal to fly a drone within 1km (0.62 miles) of an airport. It is also illegal to fly a drone higher than 400ft (120m). But experts have pointed out that this could be ineffective, given that a landing aircraft would fly below 400ft. And of course those with malicious intent would have little regard for legislation. Systems have been tested in some prisons, where drones are often used to smuggle in goods, which aim to block radio signals within a certain area in order to prevent drones from landing. For airports serious about protecting themselves from drone attacks, there is the option of a more sophisticated, if expensive, system, such as that offered by Quantum Aviation, which employs radar, radio frequency detectors and cameras to detect when drones are nearby and locate where they came from. ""In an ideal world, you talk to a person but to do that you need to know where the drones are coming from,"" said Mr Lanni. ""What you don't want is to have them dropping out of the sky."" The Quantum Aviation system can ""jam"" a drone - effectively stopping it working - the drone should, in theory, have a default mode that would see it either return to where it came from or land safely. DJI, the world leader in making civilian drones, introduced geo-fencing systems in its products in 2013. This technology can prevent drones from flying in some locations and offers warnings to drone operators flying near a restricted zone. The weighted net entangles the drone and brings it to the ground If jamming a drone or geo-fencing does not work, there are some more blunt instruments to bring down the devices. The French authorities have demonstrated how you can use a drone equipped with a net to catch another one, and there are several firms, including DroneDefence and OpenWorks Engineering which offer to fire a net to trap a rogue drone. Lasers are another option and both the US and China have experimented with anti-drone lasers, that can shoot down a drone within seconds of locating it. The weapon works by fixing a laser beam on the aircraft long enough to burn through it. Whatever happens in the case of the rogue drones at Gatwick, airports will now be forced to consider the issue more seriously, thinks Iain Gray, director of aerospace at Cranfield University. ""Airports are alive to the issues and want to work closely with academics to help shape the technology that is needed for the future,"" he told the BBC.

"The Friday before Christmas is one of the busiest nights of the year for the NHS. (Image posed by models) On the last Friday before Christmas, revellers across the UK pile out of their offices ready to celebrate with a few (or a few too many) drinks. The day has become so notorious, some people have given it a nickname: Mad Friday or, in places, Black Eye Friday. It is one of the NHS'sbusiest days of the year,externalfor treating alcohol-related illness and injury. That's why one charity is calling for Black Eye Friday to be given a new nickname. Maxine Thompson-Curl, chief executive officer ofOne Punch UK,external- a charity which raises awareness of one-punch assaults and killings - says the name glorifies violence. Ms Thompson-Curl set up the charity after her son was killed in 2011 from a one-punch assault. ""The name of it is giving people the go ahead just to be violent,"" she said. ""We want to call it Festive Friday, because it's about having fun."" Caroline and her husband Ian, two days before the assault Caroline McGuiness's husband Ian Allan was killed after he was punched on the weekend before Christmas in 2001. Ian, then 34, was on a night out with friends in Newcastle when an argument broke out in a taxi queue. As the argument petered out, one of the group punched Ian in the head. He fell backwards, hitting his head on the pavement. It was 11:30pm when Caroline, who was 16 weeks pregnant, got a call from a police officer saying Ian was in the local A&E department. ""I was expecting him to be there with a bloody nose and looking a bit sheepish,"" she recalls. But he had swelling on the brain and had to be kept in a medically-induced coma over the whole of the Christmas period. Caroline, helped by her sister, had to put on a brave face for their three-year-old daughter. ""We moved the Christmas tree through to the dining room, but we still had to have a Christmas for her,"" she says. She recalls driving back home from the hospital one night when Mariah Carey's All I Want For Christmas Is You came on the radio. ""That's all I wanted - him,"" she says. On 28 December, six days after the initial assault, Ian died from complications from pneumonia. Karl Layton, then 24, admitted manslaughter. He was sentenced to 15 months in prison. Caroline says she supports One Punch UK's campaign to rename Black Eye Friday. ""[The name] just makes me sick. It gives me a nauseated feeling in my stomach. ""Do people think that it makes it all right to punch people because that's the name of the day?"" Caroline says she's since tried to compensate for what her family have lost at Christmas, but still looks back to that day. ""I had to bring a new daughter in the world. My daughter doesn't have an absent father - he's dead."" Ms Thompson-Curl believes the Black Eye Friday name may be regional - with people often using it in north-east England. According to Google Trends, Northern Ireland has the highest proportion of searches for Black Eye Friday across the UK, followed by England. NHS England has said it ismaking up to Â£300,000 availableover the festive period to fund dozens of so-called drunk tanks, where inebriated revellers can be checked and allowed to sleep it off.

"Maren Ueland, left, and Louisa Vesterager Jespersen were found dead in a popular tourist area A video appearing to show the murder of one of two tourists killed in Morocco is almost certainly real, Norwegian police have concluded. The bodies of university students Maren Ueland and Louisa Vesterager Jespersen were found on Monday near a popular tourist spot in the Atlas mountains. The men in the video claim the murders were in revenge for events in Syria. Police say four men arrested this week appeared in a separate propaganda video recorded before the murders. Nine further arrests were made on Thursday and Friday for ""suspected links to the perpetrators of the terrorist act"", Moroccan officials said. Moroccan police carried out raids in several cities, including Marrakesh The women's bodies were flown from the Moroccan city of Casablanca to Denmark on Friday. Ms Jespersen, who was 24 and from Denmark, and 28-year-old Norwegian Ms Ueland had been studying outdoor activities at the University of Southeastern Norway. They had arrived on a month-long holiday in Morocco on 9 December and had travelled to the foothills of Mount Toubkal, North Africa's highest peak, 10km (6 miles) from the tourist village of Imlil, south of Marrakesh. Their bodies were found in their tent. Both women had taken full precautions ahead of their trip, Maren Ueland's mother said. Thousands of Moroccans are expected to pay tribute to the women on Saturday, in a vigil outside the Norwegian and Danish embassies in Rabat. Tourist murders suspects 'backed IS' A video apparently showing the beheading of one of the women was shared on social media by supporters of so-called Islamic State, and Norwegian authorities said on Friday that while it still had to be analysed further, it seemed genuine. ""So far, there is nothing concrete to show that this video is not real,"" the crime investigation serviceKripos said in a statement (in Norwegian).,external Moroccan police released photos of three of the suspects In the video, the killer is heard saying: ""This is in revenge for our brothers in Hajin,"" a reference to a town in eastern Syria lost by so-called Islamic State (IS) to US-backed forces this week. After that video was circulated, a second low-quality video emerged showing four men in front of a flag claiming to be IS supporters. Moroccan authorities have told Norwegian police that the four men in detention are the same men who appeared in the second video. Prosecutors say the video was recorded last week, before the murders.

"This video can not be played David Brown on what he's doing to get the timetable back on track. Is the Ormskirk to Preston line the worst railway in the UK? Since the timetable changes in May, more than 2,000 services have been cancelled between the two destinations in north-west England, a figure that rises every day. In exclusive data analysed for the BBC, 5,712 trains were timetabled to run during the six-and-a-half-month period. But up until Saturday 15 December, only 3,701 operated. That meant a third of services simply vanished. The Mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, says the route operator, Northern, should now be put on final warning. Those living and depending on the route have had enough. Students missed end-of-year exams because the hourly train didn't arrive. Elderly people continue to miss important hospital appointments. Some are in trouble at work. The personal toll is huge and people in this corner of the North West feel no-one really cares about them. We spent the morning at the small station of Croston, halfway along the 16-mile route. The station has no facilities, it's a single platform exposed to the rural elements that awaits the arrival of the Northern train service. Croston station offers little shelter for waiting passengers Olive Nicholls is 23 and works in a clothes shop in Preston on an hourly contract. ""The fact that I have to tell work I'm going to be late for work, or I'm not going to be able to make it that day means I'm going to lose that day,"" she said. Juliet Essam uses the line every day. She says it's been ""a year of just not knowing when it is going to turn up"". She adds: ""People are worried about their jobs, the effect that it has on their employment when you're always late and it is not your fault. I know people who've had written warnings."" Juliet Essam is one of many unsatisfied customers Kath Almond lives in Croston. ""This is the only public transport we've got,"" she says. ""This is the main way out of the village. It is the lifeline of the village."" Kath knows one man further down the line with a learning disability who relies on the train because his electric wheelchair cannot fit in a car or taxi and there are no buses. When the service is cancelled, hour after hour, he's left on the platform in distress. Nick Macnamara tries to commute everyday from Ormskirk to Preston. He said: ""For us passengers, we feel abandoned, forgotten and generally let down by this rail company."" The timetable change back in May affected routes across the north, as Northern Rail and Network Rail tried to introduce more trains to the network. But they weren't ready and the consequences were huge. Cancellations, delays, a lack of drivers and not enough carriages became the norm. Some sections of the network have slowly improved, but for others the daily gauntlet of catching the train continues. David Brown is the managing director of Northern Rail. He admits the service they have offered in parts of 2018 has not been acceptable. ""Myself and team are committed to getting that right,"" he says. ""We're starting to see stabilisation of the timetable and were starting to see the investments were making in new trains. ""What we've had to do is take out a significant number of the trains during the autumn for repair because of damaged caused during autumn period, and we had to take the difficult decision to suspend some lines and that included the Ormskirk to Preston line."" We pushed Mr Brown on whether he was fit to run the franchise. ""Northern are absolutely fit and I'm absolutely fit,"" he said. Mr Brown remains bullish about Northern's services The Mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, doesn't agree. ""I think they should be given clear notice,"" he says. ""Things have to improve, especially at the very latest by the timetable change next May. And if not, they should be stripped of the franchise."" Our last destination of the day was Ormskirk station. When we arrived on the platform, it was announced the 11:01 was 15 minutes late. We guessed as much, as it was 11:03 and there was no train. Paul Dickie is from the Ormskirk, Preston and Southport Travellers' Association. For him, this is about more than trains. ""If you haven't got a good public transport system and a good rail system in the area, people won't bring money in and expand,"" he says. ""They'll move somewhere else.""

"Host families waited at Gatwick airport on Friday to welcome the slightly delayed group of children A group of children affected by the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster have defied the Gatwick chaos and landed in the UK in time for Christmas. Host families were at the airport to welcome 30 children, who live in areas of Belarus contaminated with radiation. The children, aged between seven and 12, will now enjoy two weeks of respite and play, thanks to the Friends of Chernobyl's Children charity. They feared it might be scrapped when drone activity closed the airport. The children travelled to Minsk airport on Friday morning, hoping their flight would not be cancelled Volunteer Sue Platts said: ""Anya, the little girl I'm hosting, is so excited to put the Christmas tree up. She's been waiting since August to do it. It would have been heartbreaking it they missed this break,"" Ms Platts began to worry on Wednesday that the flight from Minsk, in Belarus, would be cancelled as hundreds of flights were affected. Drones, groans and can't-get-homes How can a drone caused so much chaos How countries counter the drone threat But when Gatwick re-opened on Friday morning, Ms Platts and other families gathered in Santa hats in the arrivals lounge to welcome the children just a few hours after their original scheduled arrival time. ""These children have been coming to us for five years or more, so we have strong bonds with them,"" Ms Platts said. Anya, 11, lives in Mogilev, Belarus, with her grandparents The trips, which take place in summer and at Christmas, give 300-350 children living in areas suffering the economic and social impact of the nuclear disaster the chance to have a holiday abroad. ""Many have no running water or proper sanitation at home, living in wooden homes or high-rise flats with several generations in a couple of rooms,"" Ms Platts added. ""One of the most exciting things for them is having a hot bath."" The Christmas visit is funded by volunteers, who pay for flights and visas, after the children visit in the summer for English lessons, dental treatment - paid for by the dentists themselves - and fun activities, such as going to the zoo. While in the UK, they enjoy clean air, fresh water and a good diet in contrast with their food at home, which might be contaminated. Sue, with Anya (left) and Katrina, who is on the same programme ""For them, it means two weeks of creature comforts of living at home. And it's Christmas - every child loves a party."" Around 200,000 sq km (77,000 sq miles) of land - 71% of which are in Belarus, Russia and Ukraine - were contaminated with radiation after a series of explosions in one of the reactors at the nuclear plant. Some new-borns in a region close to Ukraine's border still have serious deformities, while an unusually high rate of people have rare forms of cancer,according to charity Bridges to Belarus. There were other heart-warming stories among the thousands of tales of disrupted or cancelled journeys. University student Rebecca Bradley, 20, was comforted by home-made mince pies offered by a pilot when her flight home from Canada was diverted to Glasgow. The annoyance of a long wait was alleviated by a pilot's offer of mince pies ""He said to take a few because I might get hungry while waiting,"" she said. ""We wished each other good luck on our travels and a happy Christmas. The mince pies were fruity and spicy with crumbly pastry - delicious,"" Ms Bradley added.

"Passengers whose travel plans continue to be disrupted at Gatwick after the runway was closed for 36 hours are facing extra costs from rearranged flights, car parking and hotels. Although the circumstances that caused the disruption -drones flown around the runway- are unusual, there are still specific rights for air travellers. It is important to note that extra compensation, which is normally paid under EU rules if the delay is the fault of the airline, will not be paid in this case, as the closure of Gatwick was beyond the airlines' control. The Civil Aviation Authority has confirmed this incident is ""an extraordinary circumstance"", so no extra compensation should be paid. To be clear, that does not mean that passengers should be completely left out of pocket. It is the airline's responsibility to get anyone with a ticket to their destination, unless the passenger accepts a refund instead. The airline has a duty of care to passengers in this situation. That means they must look after their customers until they can get them on an alternative flight to their destination. That might be a re-routed flight, perhaps including a stopover, or the soonest possible flight now Gatwick has reopened. They can put customers on a flight with a different airline. If the alternative flight leaves or arrives at a different airport, the airline must transport passengers to the original departure or arrival point without charge. Some passengers will choose to take a refund instead, but Adam French, of consumer group Which?, says that the airline's duty of care ends at that moment. That means someone who takes the refund and books their own - more expensive - alternative flight is unlikely to have the difference reimbursed. If a flight is still expected to depart, but late, then passengers will initially have to wait rather than be put on an alternative flight. However, for delays of more than five hours, passengers get the same rights as they would if the flight was cancelled. So, after five hours, they could be offered a refund or an alternative flight. That will be true of many passengers now. Transport Secretary Chris Grayling told the BBC that he hoped insurers would take ""an enlightened view"" about payouts. ""This is something that should be covered under travel insurance policies. We will talk to the insurance industry today to make sure they treat claims reasonably,"" he said. However, not all policies cover disruption or so-called travel abandonment. Sometimes this requires the customer to tick a box when applying for a travel policy. Policies may cover the extra costs that airlines do not pick up - such as a hotel stay or car hire overseas - and insurers have said they want to honour that, despite the unusual circumstances. Travel insurance claims should be a last resort. Any claims for extra costs should first be made to the airline. Gatwick says that passengers should not travel to the airport without checking the status of the flight with the airline first. Many airlines send out automatic alerts. There is also searchablelive flight information,externalpublished on the Gatwick Airport website. The airline must get you from A to B, so they must put you on the next possible flight to your intended destination. Travel organisation Abta says a ""through"" ticket is legally treated as one contract, so your initial carrier will be obliged to get you a replacement onward-bound flight. However, if you purchased the two tickets separately you should contact the second airline for assistance, but they would have no legal obligation to replace your original booking for free or give you a refund. After two hours, the airline should hand out food and drink vouchers to those in the airport waiting for their flights. For those stranded, the airline should provide hotel accommodation overnight. Some holidaymakers may have to end up staying an extra night before flying home. Mr French says that that cost should also be covered by the airline, but it is important to keep the airline informed, in case they have a (cheaper) alternative. This cost may have to be claimed back afterwards. Sally Gethin, editor of Gethin's Inflight News, says that travellers should keep a record and receipts of all their extra spending. Abta says this obligation only applies if you are stranded within the EU or are travelling with an EU-based airline. So if you are stuck in New York with an America-based airline they would not have to cover these extra expenses. Someone who has booked a package holiday can get a refund for the whole holiday, if their flight is cancelled. This starts to become more difficult, but customers can still try to make a claim with their airline. Another option is to try to make a claim on their travel insurance. The Association of British Insurers says that policies will vary, so customers should look at the small print or contact their insurer to check. Airlines will be required to transport you to the airports you were booked to and from. So, if an inbound flight is diverted to, say Manchester, then the airline should make travel arrangements to take you to Gatwick. Some train companies are offering to take passengers free of charge. You are taking a risk. It is unlikely that an airline will cover the cost of a taxi where other more cost-effective options, such as trains or coaches, are available. Always discuss this with the airline first. You can try to make a claim but, even if successful, this would only cover the cost to the airport, not any extra journey to get you all the way home. Those who are unsuccessful could try claiming via their travel insurance. Again this is relevant if an inbound flight is delayed or diverted. Car parking providers may waive any extra costs, the airline may cover it, or drivers could try claiming on their travel insurance if the policy covers this type of consequential loss.

"""I've lost almost 11 years of my life, I'm not going to get that back,"" says Gareth Jones When Gareth Jones was sent to prison for a crime he did not commit, he told his little niece that he was going away to work with Santa Claus. Through his three and a half years behind bars he kept this story going, telling her he was at an airport waiting to fly to Lapland while speaking to her from the prison phone. ""I feel sick that I've lied to herâ¦when I was away she kept asking, 'when are you coming back?',"" said Gareth. ""I'm thinking, I can't explain to a five year old kid that I'm in prison, so I just lied and lied."" Gareth was 22 when he was convicted and imprisoned for sexually assaulting an elderly woman with dementia while he was working at a care home near Brecon. Care worker cleared of dementia sex attack The Cardiff students fighting to clear a care worker's name Gareth, who has learning difficulties, said he was depicted at the time ""as a monster"", who had carried out a ""vicious and sadistic attack"" on a vulnerable elderly woman. Now Gareth and his family have had the best Christmas present they could have wished for. His conviction has been quashedby the Court of Appeal, thanks to a team of Cardiff law students who started working to clear his name back in 2012. At his trial the jury heard how the woman lost about a litre of blood - but no DNA evidence was found on Gareth or his unwashed clothes While it has been years since he left prison, Gareth has been far from a free man. More than a decade later the guilty verdict, and being on the Sex Offenders' Register, has made it hard for him to do simple things, like see his family, travel, get a job, and rebuild his life in the close-knit community of Llandovery, where he now lives. ""I appreciate those close friends I was in school with, who believed I was innocent,"" said Gareth, now 33. ""But it's taken a while for this town to believe my side of the story because I've been beaten up, I've been jumped, I've been called a granny rapist, a paedophile, a nonce. ""I just bite my lip and say 'you believe what you want to believe - I know that I'm innocent at the end of the day'."" This belief has kept him going ever since his life changed when he helped a 77-year-old dementia patient to bed at the nursing home where he had worked for two years. Gareth, from Trecastle, was initially employed as a kitchen porter, but with the manager's blessing he ""swapped"" jobs with a care assistant who fancied a change of role - an action later condemned by the judge at his trial as inappropriate and ""astonishing"". It was when he was changing the patient's incontinence pad he realised she was bleeding heavily, and says he pressed an emergency call button for help. When colleagues arrived he left the room, as he could not stand the sight of blood, but later accompanied the woman to hospital, before returning to the home and offering to speak to police. But it was not until he was preparing to leave for work the following evening, that the police arrived at his home. At their request, he gave them his unwashed uniform from the previous night's shift. He was then arrested for sexual assault. ""That's when my life just crumbled. I felt like my heart had just been ripped out of me,"" he said. ""I was shocked, all over the placeâ¦I'd done nothing wrong."" After 28 hours of questioning, Gareth was charged and was remanded before standing trial at Cardiff Crown Court in July 2008. He denied the allegations, but was found guilty of engaging in sexual activity with a patient with a mental disorder. Gareth now hopes to be able to travel Gareth, who was diagnosed as a child with a learning difficulty which impairs his understanding, found the trial incomprehensible. ""I couldn't understand most of what they were going on about,"" he said, ""I kept asking the security guard what was happening but he kept telling me to shush"". ""I thought my solicitor and barrister, they've been in court before, they know what they're doing, I'll just listen to them."" Legal aid reforms 'risk serious miscarriages of justice' After less than three hours of deliberation, he was found guilty by the jury. ""I just broke down, crying and shaking,"" he said. ""I remember my dad kicking off when the security people were taking me down. ""I went to try and give him a hug and say goodbye, but I didn't get the chance because the guard yanked me away."" How BBC Wales News covered Gareth's conviction in 2008 Gareth - who had no previous convictions - was sentenced to nine years in prison,but this was reduced on appeal to seven years after a judge condemned as it as ""manifestly excessive"".,external He served three and a half years at Usk Prison, before being released on licence in January 2012. ""There were a lot of sex offenders and some lifers in there, and I thought right, this is my new home now,"" said Gareth. ""I know you hear it all the time in prison, but I just kept on telling (the other inmates), I've done nothing wrong, I'm innocent. ""There's no point kicking and screaming, until you leave those prison gates: then you can fight itâ¦and that's what I did."" Law school slams 'inflexible' system The law students worked for six years to try and overturn Gareth's conviction Gareth contemplated suicide - but then the Cardiff University Innocence Project took up his case. A hearing at the Court of Appeal in London in November marked the culmination of six years of work by students to uncover grounds to challenge his conviction. It is the second time the project, which brings law students together with experts to investigate alleged miscarriages of justice alongside their studies, has cleared a man's name. They are the only university-based innocence project in the UK to achieve such a result. The group made history in 2014 when former gang member Dwaine George - jailed for life in 2002 after teenager Daniel Dale was shot dead in Manchester -was cleared of murder. If not for the determination of his carer Paula Morgan, the law students who have worked on the project would most likely never have heard of Gareth. Paula Morgan, who lives with Gareth, said she could not believe his case had ever gone to trial as there was no evidence Paula has known Gareth since he was a child. She never doubted his innocence and was delighted when the students took on his case. ""It took months of searching before I came across them... it was amazing because I'd tried several barristers and organisations but unless you have money there's no justice,"" she said. ""It's gratifying that there are people out there who care about justice; they're going to go into their professional lives with that knowledge, in a better place to help people like Gareth who can't afford legal representation."" His appeal team argued the medical evidence at his trial was weak, as the elderly patient could have been injured another way, and there was no forensic evidence found on Gareth or the unwashed uniform he handed to the police. They also suggested he was not given the right support for someone with his learning difficulty, which hampered his understanding of the trial. Gareth describes the Innocence Project team as ""like a second family"" and Paula as like a ""second mum"", adding, ""I owe my life to them, basically"". Now that his name has been cleared he will be removed from the Sex Offenders' Register and he now hopes to get on with his life. ""I've lost almost 11 years of my life, I'm not going to get that back,"" he said. ""But I want to go back out and work, earn a living, a decent minimum wage,"" he said. ""I'd like to go to Canada, go fishing there with my father and some friends - things like that, go travelling, spend time with my nieces and nephew without needing the police's permission first... move on and do things I want to do without asking the police's permission, following their rules.

"US Secretary of Defense James Mattis will be departing his post in February The abrupt resignation of Defence Secretary Jim Mattis has alarmed an already tense Capitol Hill, causing lawmakers on both sides to speak out. Democrats decried the latest Trump administration departure as a ""crisis"", but Republicans also voiced concern. Senators Mitch McConnell and Marco Rubio called the move distressing and damaging to the US on the world stage. Gen Mattis appeared to clash with Mr Trump over his decision to withdraw troops from Syria. In his resignation letter, Gen Mattis, 68, said the president had the right to appoint someone ""whose views are better aligned with yours"". The announcement of his departure came amid two major military decisions Gen Mattis had opposed: withdrawing troops from Syria and reducing US presence in Afghanistan. US allies were not consulted or informed ahead of time about the president's decisions, US media reported. The respected general will leave the job in February, though it remains unclear who President Donald Trump has in mind to replace him. On Capitol Hill, Gen Mattis' resignation - and his reason for doing so - shocked lawmakers on both sides of the aisle. US Defence Secretary Mattis resigns Read his resignation letter in full The White House revolving door: Who's gone? Democratic Senator Mark Warner, who is vice chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, labelled the development ""scary"". ""Secretary Mattis has been an island of stability amidst the chaos of the Trump administration,"" he said. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Former vice-president Joe Biden also weighed in, saying Gen Mattis' presence would be missed and his exit makes it ""clear this administration has abandoned those core American beliefs"". Retired Army Gen Stanley McChrystal, the former top US commander in Afghanistan, told CNN: ""The kind of leadership that causes a dedicated patriot like Jim Mattis to leave should give pause to every American."" Even top lawmakers from Mr Trump's own Republican Party have criticised the administration over Gen Mattis' departure. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he was ""distressed"" to hear the resignation was reportedly due to ""sharp differences"" with the president on ""key aspects of America's global leadership"". The Kentucky Republican also urged Mr Trump to choose a replacement ""who shares Secretary Mattis' understanding"" of American principles. Allow Twitter content?

"This video can not be played Trump: ""Any measure that funds the government must include border security"" US President Donald Trump has vowed a ""very long"" government shutdown if Democrats do not fund his border wall. Mr Trump is demanding $5.7bn (Â£4.5bn), which was passed by the House of Representatives, but is expected to be rejected in the Senate. ""I hope we don't but we are totally prepared for a very long shutdown,"" he said during a White House event. If no deal is reached, parts of the US government will begin to close at midnight on Friday. With only hours remaining to strike a deal, Mr Trump said that the ""chances are probably very good"" of a ""Democrat shutdown"". The Republican president met senators from his own party beforehand at the White House, where they held a ""great meeting"" that ""lasted a long time,"" he added. ""Shutdown today if Democrats do not vote for Border Security!"" he tweeted earlier on Friday. The Senate is currently voting on a measure that the House approved a day earlier by 217-185. The window for senators to vote will remain open for much of the day on Friday, as senators return to Washington from around the country. Mr Trump will postpone his Christmas trip to Florida in the event of a shutdown, aides say. Any partial shutdown would be the third such closure of federal agencies in 2018. If it occurs, it may not be settled until after the New Year, when Democrats take control of the House. US House passes bill for Trump's border wall Rain falls on the White House on Thursday night In early morning tweets on Friday, Mr Trump accused Democrats of ""trying to belittle the concept of a Wall, calling it old-fashioned"". ""The fact is there is nothing else's that will work, and that has been true for thousands of years. It's like the wheel, there is nothing better,"" Mr Trump wrote. Allow Twitter content?

""In Israel the Wall is 99.9% successful,"" he added. ""Will not be any different on our Southern Border!"" ""If the Dems vote no, there will be a shutdown that will last for a very long time. People don't want Open Borders and Crime!"" A budget agreement seemed a done deal this week until Mr Trump dug in his heels after he was hit by a rare backlash from hardline conservatives outraged by the lack wall funding. He is now urging Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell to invoke the so-called ""nuclear option"". Six things that could topple Donald Trump's border wall Who pays for Donald Trump's wall? It is a rule change that would allow the budget to pass by a simple majority of 51 votes, rather than the 60 currently required under Senate rules. The president's fellow Republicans currently have 51 seats in the 100-seat Senate. But Mr McConnell has repeatedly refused in the past to invoke such an extreme legislative manoeuvre. A number of Republican senators on Friday made clear their staunch opposition to the ""nuclear option"". They warned it would be politically explosive in an upper chamber that prides itself on cross-party comity. Retiring Republican Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona tweeted: ""Deploying the nuclear option would blow that [bipartisanship] up. I will not vote to do it."" Republican Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee also said he would vote no. Mr Alexander, who announced his retirement this week, said in a statement: ""I want to put a stop to this practice of the Senate breaking its rules to change its rules."" Trump supporters angry at wall 'retreat' Roughly a quarter of federal agencies - including the departments of Homeland Security, Transportation, Agriculture, State, and Justice - will shut down by the end of Friday if no deal is reached. National parks and forests will close. But federal programmes on pensions and healthcare will continue to function, as will the military, border patrol, coast guard, federal judiciary, air traffic control and airport security. This video can not be played Mr Trump said he would take responsibility for a shutdown in testy exchanges with Democrats Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer The US Postal Service, which is delivering millions of packages before Christmas, will also be unaffected as it is an independent agency. More than 800,000 government employees will either have to stay at home unpaid, or work without pay. ""Ugh, are you ruining my life?"" said Republican Senator Susan Collins when she was told by reporters of Mr Trump's vow to veto any budget deal missing funds for a US-Mexico border wall. Democratic Senator Kirsten Gillibrand called the shutdown ""100% avoidable"", accusing Mr Trump of ""choosing funding for his ineffective and wasteful border wall over what's best for our country"".

"The Grande Tema was due to dock at Tilbury Four stowaways found on a cargo ship in the Thames Estuary have been detained after the vessel's crew was threatened. The Grande Tema's crew had to lock themselves in the vessel's bridge for safety, a spokesman said. Essex Police said the vessel was boarded and secured shortly after 23:00 GMT on Friday - almost 14 hours after the force was first called. Four men who were on the ship have been held under the Immigration Act, the force added. A police spokesman said they would be handed over to UK Border Force. The stowaways had demanded to be taken to the coast, according to the ship's owner. Police previously said the situation was not being treated as a hostage, piracy or terror-related issue. GPS trackers showed the 71,000-tonne ship sailing in circles in the Thames Estuary. It had set off from Lagos, Nigeria, on 10 December. It docked at Tilbury just before 04.30 GMT. Grimaldi Group, which owns the vessel, said the four stowaways were discovered on board four days ago. They were put under surveillance in a cabin but escaped earlier and made threats to the ship's master as the vessel approached Tilbury, urging him to get close to the coast. A map showing the Grande Tema in the Thames Estuary at 17:00 GMT Grimaldi spokesman Paul Kyprianou said: ""The vessel was coming from Nigeria and was bound to Tilbury and those four stowaways were in the cabin. ""Today they managed to escape from the cabin and they started threatening the crew, requesting the master of the vessel [navigate] very close to the coast. ""That request was probably because they wanted to jump and reach the British coast."" He said the crew had locked themselves in the command area of the vessel. Mr Kyprianou added: ""It's a small group but obviously you can understand it would be scary.""

"Nearly three million road journeys are expected to be made on Friday as people begin their Christmas getaway, motoring organisations have warned. ""Significant"" congestion is expected on major roads, with delays likely on the M25, M6 and M40, the RAC said. The RAC's Matt Dallaway said travelling in the evening would miss the busiest time on major roads and motorways. The M49 near Bristol - which links the M5 with the M4 - has reopened after a major gas leak closed the motorway. ""Plan your journey, everyone is a hurry to see their loved ones and friends and family, but please think about when you're going to travel,"" Mr Dallaway told the BBC. The RAC says the number of leisure journeys will peak on Boxing Day, with 6.8 million trips. How to avoid the Christmas traffic jams Christmas getaway in Wales begins Mr Dallaway said: ""We're at this time of year when everyone is frantically trying to get their Christmas presents done, e-commerce is through the roof so there'll be delivery drivers all over working through to Christmas Eve. ""It's obviously a lot milder this yearâ¦ so that will take a lot of people to the roads."" Meanwhile,a further drone sightingagain disrupted flights at Gatwick airport on Friday evening.

"This video can not be played Is this the drone which caused chaos at Gatwick? Police hunting those responsible for the Gatwick drones chaos have identified ""persons of interest"", the BBC understands. The UK's second busiest airport has reopened after drones flying over the airfield closed it for more than a day. Police are exploring ""a number of lines of inquiry"", including environmental activism and ""high-end criminal behaviour"". Officers are focusing on ""likely locations in and around the airport"". They said there was ""no evidence"" the use of the drones was state-sponsored. Gatwick'srunway reopened on Friday morningand 837 flights were scheduled, but there were still delays and cancellations. Thousands of passengers - including some attending funerals, honeymoons and Christmas reunions with their families -remain strandedat Gatwick. Allow Twitter content?

Steve Barry, Sussex Police Assistant Chief Constable, told the BBC ""persons of interest"" had been identified as part of the investigation but officers were keeping an open mind over the motive. While terrorism has been ruled out, environmental activism is one line of inquiry. Mr Barry said there was no evidence of involvement of a foreign power, but described the drone activity as ""really high-end criminal behaviour"". Gatwick Airport - live updates ""This is a really significant criminal offence,"" he said. ""We're working on the assumption that there was more than one drone operating around Gatwick in the last 48 hours. ""In terms of how many perpetrators, there's a number of lines of inquiry, there's an ongoing investigation, we're pursuing that trying to find out who has been responsible for this really malicious criminal behaviour."" Extra ""mitigating measures"" from the government, police and military have allowed Gatwick to reopen Mr Barry said a drone had last been seen at 22:00 GMT on Thursday. He added measures to tackle the threat ranged from ""technical, sophisticated"" options to ""detect and mitigate drone incursions"" right through to ""less sophisticated options"",  including using shotguns. He said the drones could have been operated from a fair distance away, but police were focusing on ""likely locations in and around the airport"". Asked when measures were first put in place, Mr Barry said: ""There were always some measures in place. The additions to those took some time to request and to arrive here at Gatwick."" He said it took ""hours rather than days"" to request extra measures, but added: ""Coordinating that, deploying that, getting it set up at Gatwick has taken some time but we've learnt from that."" ""This incident has been really unusual in the concerted and malicious and really criminal level of the behaviour of the drone operator and that did cause us some challenges,"" he added. Gatwick boss Chris Woodroofe said ""mitigating measures"" from the government and military had given him ""confidence to reopen the airport"".

It could not operate while the drones were in flight in case they hit and damaged a plane. Pilots' union Balpa said it understood detection and tracking equipment had been installed around Gatwick's perimeter and that if the drones reappeared the airport would close again. One family said their Christmas holiday plans had been ruined. Kevin and Lisa Haynes, and their daughters Aphea, eight, and 11-year-old Jayda, were due to go on a cruise, but their flight to Madrid was cancelled, which meant they would miss their connecting plane to Miami.

Her Gatwick-bound flight from Tenerife South should have left on Thursday. However, after a six-and-a-half hour wait she was told to retrieve her bags and join a queue to rebook her flight. She said she had been given two options. One was to return to Gatwick on Sunday. The other was to return to Luton or Southend on Saturday. She said: ""I chose Luton as I could not risk rebooking to go to Gatwick in case the airport was not operational still."" It is illegal to fly a drone within 1km of an airport or airfield boundary and flying above 400ft (120m) - which increases the risk of a collision with a manned aircraft - is also banned.

LadBaby's version of We Built This City notched up 75,000 combined sales this week to finish 18,500 ahead of Ava Max's Sweet But Psycho at number two. Last week's chart-topper, Thank U, Next by Ariana Grande, dropped to number three. LadBaby's track is the first novelty song to claim the festive top spot since Bob the Builder's Can We Fix It? in 2000. This was despite many commentators - including BBC Music reporter Mark Savage - writing off his chances. ""Sorry, but LadBaby won't be Christmas number one,"" he predicted on Tuesday, citing the track's ""almost negligible"" performance on streaming platforms. Thanks in part to a last-minute push, though, the track ended up triumphant, with downloads representing 93% of its total combined sales. BBC Music reporter Mark Savage: OK, I got it wrong. Earlier this week, I said LadBaby hadn't asnowball's chance in hellof being Christmas number one. At the time it seemed to be true. The song was doing good business in downloads, but it was seriously behind the competition on streaming services. What I missed was the powerful combination of LadBaby's charitable intentions and the public's love of an underdog. Over the next three days, Chris Evans championed the track on BBC Radio 2, while Mark and his eminently likeable family cropped up on MTV, Channel 4, The Sun andBBC Breakfast,external. The result? We Built This City sold more than 75,000 copies - up from about 15,000 when I wrote the article. I met LadBaby on Friday to congratulate him on his Christmas miracle. He assured me there were no hard feelings, although his wife did delight in calling me ""the Grinch"". It's a fair cop. I'm off to eat some humble pie. Or should that be humble sausage roll? Official Charts chief executive Martin Talbot said: ""It is a truly fantastic achievement by LadBaby to claim the 2018 Official Christmas number one. ""In doing so, he has also shown once again the enduring power of campaign singles, especially at this time of year."" The last charity single to be number one at Christmas was A Bridge Over You by The Lewisham and Greenwich NHS Choir in 2015. The song - a mash-up of Simon and Garfunkel's Bridge Over Troubled Water and Coldplay's Fix You - got a helping hand when Justin Bieber told his fans to support it instead of his own track Love Yourself. Bob the Builder's was the last novelty single to top the chart at Christmas What's the recipe for a Christmas number one? Ed Sheeran topped the festive singles chart last year with Perfect, a song he released in three separate versions in a bid to clinch the Christmas crown. There is no change at the top of this year's album chart for Christmas, with the soundtrack to The Greatest Showman spending its 23rd week at number one and registering its strongest week of sales to date. This week's top 40 also sees Bruce Springsteen claim the week's highest (and only) new entry at six with Springsteen on Broadway, a live album taken from his Netflix special.

"Mr Clark found the winning ticket in his van after being urged to check by his partner A builder found the winning ticket for a Â£76m EuroMillions jackpot tucked in the visor of his van six weeks after the draw.

"Alex says he was targeted for being trans Alex Jones has a pair of headphones that completely covers his ears. ""If I'm ever out and about I usually wear them,"" he says. ""So I don't hear anything transphobic."" Alex came out to his friends and family as trans in 2013 aged 15. He describes it as an ""empowering"" move - but claims that he was bullied more at school as a result. He says that he started receiving a steady trickle of slurs like ""tranny"" from anonymous accounts on social media. Sorry, your browser cannot display this map If the map does not load clickhere,external He claims that one person started being openly hostile, insulting him to his face and sending him abusive messages. ""You're a tranny,"" one of the messages allegedly read. ""Nobody will accept you,"" he claims another said. Alex did his best to avoid her. Then one day, in Cwmbran town centre, the situation turned violent, he claims. ""I was hugging another friend,"" says Alex, now 21. ""And as I turned around she was just stood there. And that's when she hit me."" Alex called the police. He says that he went to the station to give a statement, asking them to record it as a transgender hate crime. ""There were several witnesses. [But] the police just dropped the case. They never explained why. ""It made me not trust them,"" he adds. Gwent police confirmed that they initially logged a crime report for a violent transgender hate crime - but that the caller ""later confirmed that they did not believe they had been targeted because of their gender identity"". Alex disputes this claim. ""The incident was fully investigated but without independent evidence to support the case, the decision was made that it would not be possible to proceed,"" a spokesperson for Gwent police said. Alex's case highlights wider uncertainties around the way police treat hate crime, which has risen significantly over the last four years - in part thanks to major improvements in reporting and recording. Some police forces say that they are still ""vastly underreported"" across the UK, however. BBC Three and the BBC's data team analysed four years of data on homophobic and transgender hate crimes provided by 38 police forces. According to the data, 20-29 year-olds are the age group most likely to report being victims of homophobic or transgender hate crime. The data show that people in their 20s are accused of homophobic hate crimes more often than any other age group. Suspects in transgender hate crimes tend to be teenagers or even younger, according to the numbers. The figures show that 70 children aged under-13 - including some younger than seven - have been reported to police for homophobic or transgender hate crimes since 2014. Changes to the way police record crimes have contributed to a two-thirds rise in records of homophobic hate crime and a rise in transgender hate crime of one and half times over the last four years. But the increase hasn't been mirrored by an improvement in the number of crimes solved. Just one in eight (13%) recorded homophobic hate crimes resulted in a charge in 2017 - down from almost one in four (23%) in 2014. An overwhelming majority of the cases in the records for 2017 were closed without resolution. This was usually because of a lack of evidence or a failure to identify a suspect, according to the data. Dr Stevie-Jade Hardy, an Associate Professor in Hate Studies at the University of Leicester, said the rise in all kinds of hate crime over the last four years is probably down to police improvements in recording and better reporting by the public. She cautioned that under-reporting is still significant, however - and ""especially acute"" when it comes to homophobic and transphobic hate crime. ""Our research suggests that there's layers of resistance to reporting including the normalisation of experiences, the perception that reports will not be taken seriously, and fear of being 'outed',"" she said. It's possible that changes to society have also contributed to the rise in hate crimes, she added. This year the government launched a consultation on theGender Recognition Actfollowing calls to make it easier for individuals to change their legal gender. The event was one of a number that revealed ""pervasive hostility"" towards the trans population, according to Dr Hardy. A decade after gay teen Michael Causer's murder, is hate crime rising? Hostility to men and elderly people could become hate crimes Police must tackle hate crime problems, watchdog says The data is from Freedom of Information responses received from 38 police forces across England, Scotland and Wales. They show that Merseyside has the highest rate of recorded homophobic hate crimes, followed by West Yorkshire, South Wales and Leicestershire. The areas with the highest recorded rates of hate crimes are not necessarily the most hostile environments for LGBTQ+ individuals. According to Dr Hardy, some forces are better at recording hate crimes than others. Specialist training for frontline officers, and campaigning to improve reporting, can also have an impact. ""Additionally, the drivers behind acts of homophobic and transphobic hate crime may differ from rural environments to urban areas,"" she says. Policeman at Brighton Pride event Michael Robinson, a 28-year-old care home worker from Merseyside, was the victim of a homophobic hate crime at work in 2015 - when a colleague verbally abused him. ""She confronted me in the middle of the lounge where residents, staff and family were present,"" he said. Michael's colleague shouted a string of homophobic slurs and threatened to beat him up. He went to the police who recorded it as a hate crime and opened an investigation. It led to the dismissal of his colleague. Michael declined to take the criminal case further. Merseyside police said that hate crimes are ""vastly underreported"" across the UK, and that it has taken steps to improve this state of affairs - such as training hate crime officers in new skills to treat victims appropriately. ""We're proud that we have developed a really positive relationship with the LGBTQ+ community and partners, and believe that this supports the higher level of hate crime reports received by the Force,"" said Assistant Chief Constable Julie Cooke. Ben Hodge is an 18-year-old transgender activist from Liverpool. He says that although he has experienced intimidation and abuse, he has never reported it to the police. ""It happens on the bus quite a bit,"" he says. ""In Liverpool you get a lot of young lads - and by young I mean primary school age - hanging out."" He recalls an incident on the bus when he was confronted by some children who he says were ""11 or 12"" years old. ""They walked up to my face and said, 'Are you a boy or a girl? I think we deserve to know.' ""They were five or six years younger than me. But if three of them teamed up they could still do some damage."" Ben didn't report this to the police because he says they ""didn't really do anything to me"". He says he often experiences incidents that are uncomfortable but he does not consider serious enough to warrant a report. Liverpool police station can also feel ""intimidating"", he adds. Despite this, Ben says that Liverpool - which hosts events including a free Pride festival, and a Transgender Day of Remembrance Vigil - is an LGBTQ+ friendly city. ""The minority of people who commit these crimes are ruining it for the majority,"" he says. Any existing criminal offence can be a hate crime if it is considered to be motivated by prejudice. In total more than 90,000 hate crimes of all kinds - including race, religion and disability - wererecorded by police,externalin the year ending March 2018. The rise in offences has been driven largely by a sharp increase in Public Order offences - a category of offence that relates to behaviour in public, including threats, harassment and verbal abuse. While some regional police are working to improve hate crime reporting, some of the country's most senior police officers have criticised a proposal by Home Secretary Sajid Javid to widen the definition of hate crime to include categories such asmisogyny, ageism and misandryquestioning the value of pursuing such crimes if it is at the expense of others. Overstretched police now have less time to focus on ""genuine crimes"" such as burglary and violence, according to Sergeant Richard Cooke, chairman of the West Midlands Police Federation. Police chiefs say that funding in England and Wales has decreased in real terms by nearly a fifth, and there are 20,000 fewer officers. This video can not be played Why do young people love to hate? For people like Alex - who says his trust in the police has been affected - it is vital that potential hate crimes are taken seriously. ""I wouldn't want what happened to me to happen to anybody else,"" he says. ""Other transgender people should know that you can't say or do stuff that victimises other people [just] because they're different. ""The number of hate crimes has gone up, and that means the police have to do something about it."" Gwent police said they have a team of ""over 30"" specialist Hate Crime Support Officers. Detective Chief Superintendent Mark Warrender, Gwent Police's lead for hate crime, who also chairs the Hate Crime and Criminal Justice Board Cymru, said: ""The increase we have seen in recorded anti-LGBT hate crime in Gwent is due to a number of factors, including regular training for officers, increased hate crime awareness within communities, and improved confidence in reporting.""

"The boy, whose photo has been blurred, was admitted to Bristol Royal Hospital for Children to treat an undescended testicle A two-year-old boy has been left infertile after surgeons operated on the wrong testicle, his family says. The boy was admitted to Bristol Royal Hospital for Children earlier in the week to treat an undescended testicle. He had one healthy testicle and one that did not function. His father said surgeons operated on the wrong one by mistake and have ""castrated him"". University Hospitals Bristol has apologised and said it has launched a serious incident investigation. The boy's father, whose name has not been used to protect his son's identity, said his son's undescended testicle was discovered during a routine check up. The toddler boy was referred to a specialist and on Monday he was booked in for an operation at the Bristol Royal Hospital for Children. The family said they were told it was ""just a minimal operation"" with ""minimal risk"" and it would be over in around 30 minutes ""We were waiting and waiting,"" his father said. ""After two and a half hours the manager, surgeons and consultants they came and I knew something was not right. ""Me and my wife started panicking, they called us into the office and told us things didn't go right and the operation wasn't a success."" The operation took place at the Bristol Children's Hospital The couple said they were told a surgeon had mistakenly inserted a camera ""into the wrong side"" and now their son's healthy testicle would ""never work"". ""I was very distressed, it was an awful disaster for a simple operation they destroyed everything and they ruined my son,"" his father said. ""They castrated him and now my son's future life has dramatically changed."" The boy's mother said it was ""absolutely horrible"" what the surgeons had done. ""They broke my heart and they basically destroyed his future,"" she said. ""I can't find the words to explain how I'm feeling - there are no words. Even tears, I have no more tears. ""We just hope for a miracle, this is what we hope."" In a statement, University Hospitals Bristol apologised saying it was ""deeply sorry"". ""As soon as our staff members realised what had happened, they met with the family, told them what happened, and apologised again at that point,"" a spokesperson said. ""I would like to re-iterate that we take patient safety extremely seriously here and also the quality of our clinical care. ""As a result, a serious incident investigation has been launched. We will keep the family informed and involved in this process.""

"This video can not be played Is this the drone which caused chaos at Gatwick? Gatwick's runway has reopened after drones caused the airport to shut down for more than a day. The airport, the UK's second busiest, said 837 flights were scheduled but there were delays and cancellations. Boss Chris Woodroofe said ""mitigating measures"" from the government and military had given him ""confidence to reopen"". The drone operator is still at large and police said it was possible they were an environmental activist. The airport is expected to be ""back to normal"" by the end of Saturday. Gatwick Airport - live updates Thousands of passengers - including some attending funerals, honeymoons and Christmas reunions with their families -remain strandedat Gatwick. The airport could not operate while the drones were in flight in case they hit and damaged a plane. The first flights were Norwegian Air, Easyjet and BA departures and a China Eastern Airlines arrival Gatwick said the 837 flights planned for Friday would have more than 130,000 passengers on board. A total of 155 flights have been cancelled. Pilots' union Balpa said it understood detection and tracking equipment had been installed around Gatwick's perimeter and that if the drones reappear the airport would close again. Mr Woodroofe said: ""Additional mitigating measures provided by government agencies and military have given me the confidence to reopen the airport. ""We are now operating at almost normal runway conditions but the challenge for the airlines, as the result of this disruption, is that their planes are not all in the right place. ""So what we'll be doing today is recovering their operations so by tomorrow we are back to standard operation and continue to recover the situation for our passengers."" He added he was determined to get passengers moving so ""they can enjoy their Christmas"". The first flights in and out of Gatwick were Norwegian Air, Easyjet and BA departures and a China Eastern Airlines arrival from Shanghai. Staff continue to advise passengers tocheck their flight status before turning up at the airport,external. Ryanair said it was switching all of its Gatwick flights to operate in and out of Stansted airport on Friday. Extra ""mitigating measures"" from the government, police and military have allowed Gatwick to reopen Sussex Police was locked in a game of cat and mouse with the drone operator. Officers have so far failed to locate the ""industrial specification"" drones or their pilot and had been considering plans to shoot a device down. But Steve Barry, Sussex assistant chief constable, said they were in a ""much better position today"". Mr Barry said a drone had last been seen at 22:00 GMT on Thursday. He added measures to tackle the threat include ""technical, sophisticated options to detect and mitigate drone incursions, all the way down to less sophisticated options""  including using shotguns. Mr Barry previously told BBC Breakfast there were a ""number of lines of inquiry"" into the ""very malicious and criminal behaviour"", including the possibility it could have been the work of an environmental activist. At a press conference, he said there was ""no evidence"" the use of the drones was state-sponsored. Drones, groans and can't-get-homes Drones ruin honeymoon and 'final' granny trip How can a drone cause so much chaos? Gatwick Airport disruption: Your rights This video can not be played The first plane to leave Gatwick since Wednesday was bound for Lapland Transport Secretary Chris Grayling said there was no evidence it was terror-related. But he called it a type of disruption ""we've not seen before"" and ""lessons need to be learned"". He said the situation was ""unprecedented, anywhere in the world"". ""Every possible measure will be put in place to make sure this can't happen again,"" he said. But he added there was ""no simple solution"" and ""you can't fire weapons haphazardly around an airport"". It is illegal to fly a drone within 1km of an airport or airfield boundary and flying above 400ft (120m) - which increases the risk of a collision with a manned aircraft - is also banned. Endangering the safety of an aircraft is a criminal offence which can carry a prison sentence of five years. Smiles returned to some passengers' faces today as they were finally able to get away At Gatwick Airport's South Terminal this morning, passengers waited anxiously for news on whether their flights would depart. It appears to be much quieter here today, compared to the chaotic scenes yesterday. As the West Sussex airport announced the reopening of its runway on Friday, some travellers were hopeful of getting airborne. But others expressed concern that the operators of the drone had not yet been apprehended - and could go on to cause more havoc. All weary travellers could do was monitor the arrival and departure boards - showing many cancellations and delays to flights - and hope their Christmas getaways would not be ruined. Passengers have faced long waits inside the airport's terminal Travellers have found themselves unable to fly in and out of Gatwick. Thousands were left stranded for hours inside the airport's terminal building, resorting to sleeping on floors and benches. Some who spoke to the BBC includeda couple hoping to honeymoon in New Yorkand a seven-year-old who had been due to fly to Lapland. Others have found themselves stuck abroad. Airport chief Mr Woodroofe refused to comment on the possibility of those affected by the chaos being awarded compensation. The Civil Aviation Authority said it considered the event to be an ""extraordinary circumstance"", and therefore airlines were not obligated to pay any financial compensation to passengers. But that does not mean passengers should be left out of pocket. It is the airline's responsibility to get anyone with a ticket to their destination, unless the passenger accepts a refund instead.

"US Secretary of Defense James Mattis will be departing his post in February The abrupt resignation of Defence Secretary Jim Mattis has alarmed an already tense Capitol Hill, causing lawmakers on both sides to speak out. Democrats decried the latest Trump administration departure as a ""crisis"", but Republicans also voiced concern. Senators Mitch McConnell and Marco Rubio called the move distressing and damaging to the US on the world stage. Gen Mattis appeared to clash with Mr Trump over his decision to withdraw troops from Syria. In his resignation letter, Gen Mattis, 68, said the president had the right to appoint someone ""whose views are better aligned with yours"". The announcement of his departure came amid two major military decisions Gen Mattis had opposed: withdrawing troops from Syria and reducing US presence in Afghanistan. US allies were not consulted or informed ahead of time about the president's decisions, US media reported. The respected general will leave the job in February, though it remains unclear who President Donald Trump has in mind to replace him. On Capitol Hill, Gen Mattis' resignation - and his reason for doing so - shocked lawmakers on both sides of the aisle. US Defence Secretary Mattis resigns Read his resignation letter in full The White House revolving door: Who's gone? Democratic Senator Mark Warner, who is vice chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, labelled the development ""scary"". ""Secretary Mattis has been an island of stability amidst the chaos of the Trump administration,"" he said. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Retired Army Gen Stanley McChrystal, the former top US commander in Afghanistan, told CNN: ""The kind of leadership that causes a dedicated patriot like Jim Mattis to leave should give pause to every American."" Even top lawmakers from Mr Trump's own Republican Party have criticised the administration over Gen Mattis' departure. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he was ""distressed"" to hear the resignation was reportedly due to ""sharp differences"" with the president on ""key aspects of America's global leadership"".

"Artist Banksy confirmed he is behind 'Season's greetings' in Port Talbot Thousands of people have made a Christmas pilgrimage to view the latest piece by the elusive artist Banksy. ""Season's greetings"" appeared this week on a garage's walls in Port Talbot - depicting a child in snow, which is in fact ash from a skip fire. Volunteers protecting the piece said as many as 2,000 visitors have turned up - some in the middle of the night. Neath Port Talbot council officials have appealed for art fans to respect the local community. It has also brought in staff to help control traffic at the Taibach site where the piece was daubed. Banksy confirmed it was his handiworkwhen he posted a video on his social media Instagram channel,external. An estimated 2,000 have been to see the piece in just two days Plastic protective sheeting will be put up over the artwork on Saturday - with the Welsh screen star Michael Sheen contributing to the costs. The actor is also helping towards the bill for security in his home town, and help cover media and legal costs. Sheen's office said the TV and film star wanted to ensure that the financial burden of safeguarding the art did not fall on the owner of the garage, Ian Lewis. A local businessman who wants to remain anonymous will install the protective covering for free. Garage owner Mr Lewis said he only had three hours sleep when the news broke overnight on Wednesday that the graffiti had appeared. ""I am very pleased, I think it is a smashing bit of artwork. It is good for the town and I just want to protect it, and it is here for everybody,"" Mr Lewis told BBC Wales earlier in the week. The council has also urged visitors to respect the area and those living nearby. ""We understand the excitement but we want to remind visitors this is a residential area and would ask that people coming to photograph or view the Banksy do their best not disturb those living nearby,"" said an official. ""I just want to protect it, and it is here for everybody,"" said garage owner Ian Lewis Previous Banksy works have attracted their fair share of controversy, as art dealers descend, vandalism - and legal battles. It includesa long running dispute that ended up in courtwhen one of the artist's pieces was dismantled in Kent and flown to the US. 'Art Buff' was eventually returned after a High Court ruling over the graffiti that was daubed on a wall in Folkstone. Just who is Banksy? The world's most famous 'vandal' Art critic Estelle Lovatt told BBC Wales that the latest offering at Taibach in Port Talbot was clearly valuable - though difficult to put a definitive price on. Some of Banksy's work has sold for Â£1m - including the image of a girl with a balloon that wasdramatically shredded as it went under the hammer at an auction. Ms Lovatt said among the factors determining its worth were ""who falls in love with it"". This video can not be played Banksy Port Talbot snow mural 'no coincidence' She also questioned if its value would fall if the garage was removed, because Banksy meant it to be seen on the streets of Port Talbot. ""Regardless of its value, is that it brings people together, it brings communities together, and that's worth more than its weight in gold,"" she added. She also said it would put Port Talbot on the map: ""Banksy's fans don't know who he is nor care who he is and they are going to travel far and wide in order to see his work. ""It will increase Port Talbot footfall, the coffee shops and restaurants had better stock up because as people come, make pilgrimage to see this magnificent Banksy, they are going to need to be fed and watered.""

"This video can not be played Trump: ""Any measure that funds the government must include border security"" US President Donald Trump has vowed a ""very long"" government shutdown if Democrats do not fund his border wall. Mr Trump is demanding $5.7bn (Â£4.5bn), which was passed by the House of Representatives, but is expected to be rejected in the Senate. ""I hope we don't but we are totally prepared for a very long shutdown,"" he said during a White House event. If no deal is reached, parts of the US government will begin to close at midnight on Friday. With only hours remaining to strike a deal, Mr Trump said that the ""chances are probably very good"" of a ""Democrat shutdown"". The Republican president met senators from his own party beforehand at the White House, where they held a ""great meeting"" that ""lasted a long time,"" he added. ""Shutdown today if Democrats do not vote for Border Security!"" he tweeted earlier on Friday. The Senate is currently voting on a measure that the House approved a day earlier by 217-185. The window for senators to vote will remain open for much of the day on Friday, as senators return to Washington from around the country. Mr Trump will postpone his Christmas trip to Florida in the event of a shutdown, aides say. Any partial shutdown would be the third such closure of federal agencies in 2018. If it occurs, it may not be settled until after the New Year, when Democrats take control of the House. US House passes bill for Trump's border wall Rain falls on the White House on Thursday night In early morning tweets on Friday, Mr Trump accused Democrats of ""trying to belittle the concept of a Wall, calling it old-fashioned"". ""The fact is there is nothing else's that will work, and that has been true for thousands of years. It's like the wheel, there is nothing better,"" Mr Trump wrote. Allow Twitter content?

People don't want Open Borders and Crime!"" A budget agreement seemed a done deal this week until Mr Trump dug in his heels after he was hit by a rare backlash from hardline conservatives outraged by the lack wall funding. He is now urging Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell to invoke the so-called ""nuclear option"". Six things that could topple Donald Trump's border wall Who pays for Donald Trump's wall? It is a rule change that would allow the budget to pass by a simple majority of 51 votes, rather than the 60 currently required under Senate rules. The president's fellow Republicans currently have 51 seats in the 100-seat Senate. But Mr McConnell has repeatedly refused in the past to invoke such an extreme legislative manoeuvre. A number of Republican senators on Friday made clear their staunch opposition to the ""nuclear option"". They warned it would be politically explosive in an upper chamber that prides itself on cross-party comity. Retiring Republican Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona tweeted: ""Deploying the nuclear option would blow that [bipartisanship] up. I will not vote to do it."" Republican Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee also said he would vote no. Mr Alexander, who announced his retirement this week, said in a statement: ""I want to put a stop to this practice of the Senate breaking its rules to change its rules."" Trump supporters angry at wall 'retreat' Roughly a quarter of federal agencies - including the departments of Homeland Security, Transportation, Agriculture, State, and Justice - will shut down by the end of Friday if no deal is reached. National parks and forests will close. But federal programmes on pensions and healthcare will continue to function, as will the military, border patrol, coast guard, federal judiciary, air traffic control and airport security. This video can not be played Mr Trump said he would take responsibility for a shutdown in testy exchanges with Democrats Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer The US Postal Service, which is delivering millions of packages before Christmas, will also be unaffected as it is an independent agency. More than 800,000 government employees will either have to stay at home unpaid, or work without pay. ""Ugh, are you ruining my life?"" said Republican Senator Susan Collins when she was told by reporters of Mr Trump's vow to veto any budget deal missing funds for a US-Mexico border wall. Democratic Senator Kirsten Gillibrand called the shutdown ""100% avoidable"", accusing Mr Trump of ""choosing funding for his ineffective and wasteful border wall over what's best for our country"".

"Artist Banksy confirmed he is behind 'Season's greetings' in Port Talbot Thousands of people have made a Christmas pilgrimage to view the latest piece by the elusive artist Banksy. ""Season's greetings"" appeared this week on a garage's walls in Port Talbot - depicting a child in snow, which is in fact ash from a skip fire. Volunteers protecting the piece said as many as 2,000 visitors have turned up - some in the middle of the night. Neath Port Talbot council officials have appealed for art fans to respect the local community. It has also brought in staff to help control traffic at the Taibach site where the piece was daubed. Banksy confirmed it was his handiworkwhen he posted a video on his social media Instagram channel,external. An estimated 2,000 have been to see the piece in just two days Plastic protective sheeting will be put up over the artwork on Saturday - with the Welsh screen star Michael Sheen contributing to the costs. The actor is also helping towards the bill for security in his home town, and help cover media and legal costs. Sheen's office said the TV and film star wanted to ensure that the financial burden of safeguarding the art did not fall on the owner of the garage, Ian Lewis. A local businessman who wants to remain anonymous will install the protective covering for free. Garage owner Mr Lewis said he only had three hours sleep when the news broke overnight on Wednesday that the graffiti had appeared. ""I am very pleased, I think it is a smashing bit of artwork. It is good for the town and I just want to protect it, and it is here for everybody,"" Mr Lewis told BBC Wales earlier in the week. The council has also urged visitors to respect the area and those living nearby. ""We understand the excitement but we want to remind visitors this is a residential area and would ask that people coming to photograph or view the Banksy do their best not disturb those living nearby,"" said an official. ""I just want to protect it, and it is here for everybody,"" said garage owner Ian Lewis Previous Banksy works have attracted their fair share of controversy, as art dealers descend, vandalism - and legal battles. It includesa long running dispute that ended up in courtwhen one of the artist's pieces was dismantled in Kent and flown to the US. 'Art Buff' was eventually returned after a High Court ruling over the graffiti that was daubed on a wall in Folkstone. Just who is Banksy? The world's most famous 'vandal' Art critic Estelle Lovatt told BBC Wales that the latest offering at Taibach in Port Talbot was clearly valuable - though difficult to put a definitive price on. Some of Banksy's work has sold for Â£1m - including the image of a girl with a balloon that wasdramatically shredded as it went under the hammer at an auction. Ms Lovatt said among the factors determining its worth were ""who falls in love with it"". This video can not be played Banksy Port Talbot snow mural 'no coincidence' She also questioned if its value would fall if the garage was removed, because Banksy meant it to be seen on the streets of Port Talbot. ""Regardless of its value, is that it brings people together, it brings communities together, and that's worth more than its weight in gold,"" she added. She also said it would put Port Talbot on the map: ""Banksy's fans don't know who he is nor care who he is and they are going to travel far and wide in order to see his work. ""It will increase Port Talbot footfall, the coffee shops and restaurants had better stock up because as people come, make pilgrimage to see this magnificent Banksy, they are going to need to be fed and watered.""

"Eduard Zigar was working as a locum in Birmingham The body of a junior doctor lay undiscovered in a hospital storeroom for two days, an inquest has heard. Eduard Zigar, 25, took his own life at Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham less than a week after beginning his placement, the city's coroner's court heard. There had been difficulty identifying him as missing because hospital staff were looking under the wrong name. The coroner recorded a verdict of suicide. In a statement, the hospital trust described the death as a ""tragedy"" and said it hoped the conclusion of the inquest would ""bring some sense of closure"". Dr Zigar, a Lithuanian living in Wolverhampton, was a locum at the Birmingham hospital, allied to the upper gastro-intestinal surgical team. He was last seen on the site's CCTV at about 19:00 BST on Saturday 25 August and found in the ambulatory care unit at about 22:00 on 27 August. Latest news and updates from the West Midlands Dr Zigar had begun to work at the hospital on 20 August and appeared ""detached"" and ""quiet"" on 25 August, colleagues said. Consultant John Whiting told the hearing that he found Dr Zigar to be a little nervous, which he said was not unusual and gave him no concerns for his mental well-being. When he did not turn up for his shift on Sunday, staff were not initially worried as they assumed there had been a rota error. Dr Zigar was found in the ambulatory care department of Queen Elizabeth Hospital When Dr Zigar's friends and family became concerned, the locum agency contacted the hospital but, because of entering his name into the system incorrectly, it could find no trace of him working there. Since the death, the hospital has introduced a supervisor for the locum team. Dr Zigar's mother described him as ""tolerant and loving"" and said his death had come as a ""massive shock"".

"Businesses that trade with the EU need to take steps now to prepare for the possibility of a no-deal Brexit, a government minister has warned. Financial Secretary to the Treasury Mel Stride told the BBC's Today programme ""there is a call to action now"". HMRC haspublished an update to its advice,externalon how firms should prepare for a no-deal scenario. However, Mr Stride called the prospect of the UK leaving the EU without a deal an ""unlikely event"". Speaking to the BBC, Mr Stride said: ""The time is now, there is a call to action now. ""Those who are importing or exporting into and out of the EU 27, in the unlikely event that there is a no-deal at the end of March, will need to take certain steps. They need to do that now."" Deal or no deal? EU bewildered by Brexit confusion Brexit: A simple guide What can New Zealand teach us about Brexit? Mr Stride said businesses needed to ""get a customs agent on board"" or ""look at software they can use to make sure (of) their import and export declarations"". He added that firms should register for an Economic Operators Registration and Identification Number (EORI number) -  a system of unique identification numbers used by customs authorities throughout the European Union. Businesses should also be prepared to pay custom duties in the event of a no-deal Brexit, he warned. The latest HMRC update marks a shift in tone, with businesses being urged to take action now. The new version of the partnership pack also includes details about government funding for new IT systems and staff training, which is available to customs brokers, customs intermediaries and traders. Nimisha Raja, chief executive and founder of Nim's Fruit Crisps On Wednesday,British business groups criticised politicians for focusing on infightingrather than preparing for Brexit, warning that there was not enough time to prepare for a no-deal scenario. The groups said companies had been ""watching in horror"" at the continuing rows within Westminster. Nimisha Raja, chief executive and founder of Nim's Fruit Crisps, says businesses need to be prepared for a lot more paperwork, if there is a no-deal Brexit. Nim's Fruit Crisps sometimes has to import fruit from the EU to make its products, when fruits such as apples and pears are out of season in the UK. ""I hadn't realised quite how much we would need to do,"" she told the BBC. Preparing for the changes in the import procedure was ""quite an onerous task, and possibly [involving] extra cost in admin staff"". She would definitely be interested in applying for grants to ease the load. At the moment, in order to import any item from outside the EU, importers need to locate the specific commodity code relating to each specific product. In a no-deal scenario, this would mean British businesses would need to be able to locate commodity codes from HMRC's database, which would be time-consuming. ""Having access to funding and not having to devise it from scratch, that's brilliant. At least it would be something to start off with,"" said Ms Raja. ""There are possibly lots of costs involved that we haven't planned for. ""What will have a huge impact on cost will be whether you do all this yourself or whether you get an agent - but an agent will cost a lot."" Deal or no deal?

"Kathy Griffin has criticised the lack of women onForbes magazine's latest list,externalof the world's best-paid comedians. The Emmy Award-winning comediantweeted the top 10 of Forbes' list,externalalong with the words: ""No Women."" Jerry Seinfeld topped the rankings with estimated earnings of $57.5m (Â£45.3m). Amy Schumer was the first woman to make the list last year but has dropped back out this time. Ricky Gervais is the only British comedian on the list. He is a new entry in fifth place with earnings of $25m (Â£19.7m). Forbes said that was thanks to Humanity, his first stand-up tour for five years. Humanity was also on Netflix, and he has signed up for another Netflix special. Griffin, meanwhile, was unlikely to make the list herself. She was fired by CNN and said she lost a number of other jobs after sheposed with a fake decapitated head of President Donald Trumpin May 2017. Jerry Seinfeld and Kevin Hart are in first and second places Another comedian missing from the list is Louis CK, who was in last year's top 10 with $52m (Â£41m) earnings. But after heconfirmed sexual misconduct allegations against himin November 2017, his second Netflix special was cancelled and he has only performed ahandful of dates since. Seinfeld has topped the list in all but one year since it was first compiled in 2006. Kevin Hart took the top spot in 2016. Forbes attributes Seinfeld's earnings this year to his 2017 Netflix deal and Hulu's streaming rights to all nine seasons of Seinfeld, as well as more than $30m (Â£23.6m) from stand-up. Hart is close behind in second place with $57m (Â£44.9m). The comedian, who recentlypulled out of hosting the Oscarsdue to controversy over homophobic tweets, also earned more than $30m from touring and starred in the Jumanji film remake.

"As drones become more popular, countries will need to consider regulations to restrict usage Gatwick Airport re-opened its runway on Friday morning after hundreds of flights were grounded due to a drones being spotted over the airfield on Wednesday and Thursday. So why has a drone caused so much disruption and what are the risks posed by these devices? The term ""drone"" for some prompts images of air strikes - but the sophisticated flying robots used on the battlefield are unlikely to be what we are talking about here. The vast majority of unmanned aerial vehicles are actually small, remote-controlled quadcopters used by hobbyists and photographers. These small devices are now a mainstream gadget, which can cost from under Â£40 to several thousands of pounds. Drones are also increasingly being used in industries such as construction and retail. Gatwick runway reopens after drone chaos In October 2017, a drone collided with a commercial aircraft in Canada, striking one of the plane's wings. The plane sustained minor damage but was able to land safely. Experts agree that a drone could damage an aircraft Research on drone damage to aircraft is still limited but a number of  institutions have tested a variety of impact scenarios and each seems to reach a different conclusion. Tests conducted at the University of Dayton,externalin the US mimicked a midair collision between a 2.1lb (1kg) quadcopter and a commercial aircraft travelling at 238mph (383km/h) and appeared to show it inflicting major damage. Other research from,externalthe Alliance for System Safety of Unmanned aircraft system through research Excellence (Assure) in conjunction with the US's Federal Aviation Authority suggested drones could inflict more damage than a bird collision and the lithium ion batteries that power them may not shatter upon impact, instead becoming lodged in airframes and posing a potential risk of fire. Ravi Vaidyanathan, a robotics lecturer at Imperial College, London, told the BBC: ""The threat posed to larger aircraft by drones is small but not negligible. ""The probability of a collision is small but a drone could be drawn into a turbine. ""A drone greater than 2kg might break the cockpit windshield as well for certain aircraft."" Martin Lanni, chief executive of airspace security company Quantum Aviation, said: ""A drone looks quite fragile but the battery is hefty and if you compare a drone  to a bird, then it could be potentially more dangerous if it goes through the engine or hits the fuselage."" According to the UK Airprox Board, there were 92 instances of aircraft and drones coming close to colliding in 2017. Fighting back against rogue drones Drones ground flights at Gatwick Drone collides with commercial aeroplane in Canada There were 92 instances of aircraft and drones coming close to colliding reported in 2017 In the UK, legislation came into force in July, making it illegal to fly a drone within 1km (0.62 miles) of an airport. It is also illegal to fly a drone higher than 400ft (120m). But experts have pointed out that this could be ineffective, given that a landing aircraft would fly below 400ft. And of course those with malicious intent would have little regard for legislation. Systems have been tested in some prisons, where drones are often used to smuggle in goods, which aim to block radio signals within a certain area in order to prevent drones from landing. For airports serious about protecting themselves from drone attacks, there is the option of a more sophisticated, if expensive, system, such as that offered by Quantum Aviation, which employs radar, radio frequency detectors and cameras to detect when drones are nearby and locate where they came from. ""In an ideal world, you talk to a person but to do that you need to know where the drones are coming from,"" said Mr Lanni. ""What you don't want is to have them dropping out of the sky."" The Quantum Aviation system can ""jam"" a drone - effectively stopping it working - the drone should, in theory, have a default mode that would see it either return to where it came from or land safely. DJI, the world leader in making civilian drones, introduced geo-fencing systems in its products in 2013. This technology can prevent drones from flying in some locations and offers warnings to drone operators flying near a restricted zone. The weighted net entangles the drone and brings it to the ground If jamming a drone or geo-fencing does not work, there are some more blunt instruments to bring down the devices. The French authorities have demonstrated how you can use a drone equipped with a net to catch another one, and there are several firms, including DroneDefence and OpenWorks Engineering which offer to fire a net to trap a rogue drone. Lasers are another option and both the US and China have experimented with anti-drone lasers, that can shoot down a drone within seconds of locating it. The weapon works by fixing a laser beam on the aircraft long enough to burn through it. Whatever happens in the case of the rogue drones at Gatwick, airports will now be forced to consider the issue more seriously, thinks Iain Gray, director of aerospace at Cranfield University. ""Airports are alive to the issues and want to work closely with academics to help shape the technology that is needed for the future,"" he told the BBC.

"The boy, whose photo has been blurred, was admitted to Bristol Royal Hospital for Children to treat an undescended testicle A two-year-old boy has been left infertile after surgeons operated on the wrong testicle, his family says. The boy was admitted to Bristol Royal Hospital for Children earlier in the week to treat an undescended testicle. He had one healthy testicle and one that did not function. His father said surgeons operated on the wrong one by mistake and have ""castrated him"". University Hospitals Bristol has apologised and said it has launched a serious incident investigation. The boy's father, whose name has not been used to protect his son's identity, said his son's undescended testicle was discovered during a routine check up. The toddler boy was referred to a specialist and on Monday he was booked in for an operation at the Bristol Royal Hospital for Children. The family said they were told it was ""just a minimal operation"" with ""minimal risk"" and it would be over in around 30 minutes ""We were waiting and waiting,"" his father said. ""After two and a half hours the manager, surgeons and consultants they came and I knew something was not right. ""Me and my wife started panicking, they called us into the office and told us things didn't go right and the operation wasn't a success."" The operation took place at the Bristol Children's Hospital The couple said they were told a surgeon had mistakenly inserted a camera ""into the wrong side"" and now their son's healthy testicle would ""never work"". ""I was very distressed, it was an awful disaster for a simple operation they destroyed everything and they ruined my son,"" his father said. ""They castrated him and now my son's future life has dramatically changed."" The boy's mother said it was ""absolutely horrible"" what the surgeons had done. ""They broke my heart and they basically destroyed his future,"" she said. ""I can't find the words to explain how I'm feeling - there are no words. Even tears, I have no more tears. ""We just hope for a miracle, this is what we hope."" In a statement, University Hospitals Bristol apologised saying it was ""deeply sorry"". ""As soon as our staff members realised what had happened, they met with the family, told them what happened, and apologised again at that point,"" a spokesperson said. ""I would like to re-iterate that we take patient safety extremely seriously here and also the quality of our clinical care. ""As a result, a serious incident investigation has been launched. We will keep the family informed and involved in this process.""

"Nearly three million road journeys are expected to be made on Friday as people begin their Christmas getaway, motoring organisations have warned. ""Significant"" congestion is expected on major roads, with delays likely on the M25, M6 and M40, the RAC said. The RAC's Matt Dallaway said travelling in the evening would miss the busiest time on major roads and motorways. The M49 near Bristol - which links the M5 with the M4 - has reopened after a major gas leak closed the motorway. ""Plan your journey, everyone is a hurry to see their loved ones and friends and family, but please think about when you're going to travel,"" Mr Dallaway told the BBC. The RAC says the number of leisure journeys will peak on Boxing Day, with 6.8 million trips. How to avoid the Christmas traffic jams Christmas getaway in Wales begins Mr Dallaway said: ""We're at this time of year when everyone is frantically trying to get their Christmas presents done, e-commerce is through the roof so there'll be delivery drivers all over working through to Christmas Eve.

"England's top doctor has accused the food industry of ""failing the public"" and is calling for taxes on unhealthy food high in sugar and salt. Chief medical officer Prof Dame Sally Davies said her dream was to make fruit and vegetables cheaper for everyone from the proceeds. In her annual report, she also urged the government to ban added sugar in jars of baby food. The food industry said taxes would not change consumer behaviour. Dame Sally Davies' report,externaldetails plans to create a more healthy nation by 2040, with the focus on improving the environment we live in to make it easier for people to be healthier. This means tackling the preventable causes of 50% of chronic diseases and 40% of cancers - namely, unhealthy diet, smoking, physical inactivity, drinking too much alcohol and air pollution, she said. Based on the success of thetax on sugary drinksintroduced in April, Dame Sally wants the government to do more to force the food industry to cut sugar and salt in our everyday food. Parents would be surprised what is contained in baby food jars, Dame Sally said Dame Sally said ""industry had not delivered"" on voluntary targets set by Public Health England tomake their products healthierand called for them to do more. ""Those sectors that damage health must pay for their harm or subsidise healthier choices,"" her report says. She hinted she would like to see a tax on chocolate and junk food, with the proceeds going to subsidise fruit and vegetables, which should be on offer in obvious places in shops. But she recognised this was ""a dream"". The report recommends: extending the tax on sugary drinks to sweetened milk-based drinks a ban on added sugar and salt in jars of baby and infant food more ambitious targets for salt reduction in food (to 7g a day), saying progress had stalled since 2011 taxing foods high in sugar and salt, as a start incentives to get people eating more fruit and vegetables And it urges the government and NHS England to set targets to reduce inequalities in childhood obesity and smoking in pregnancy, which predominately affect poorer communities. Dame Sally said obesity was an issue of inequality, with children and adults in the poorest communities more likely to have diseases related to their weight at an earlier age, and lasting for longer. She said she would be accused of being ""chief nanny"" of a nanny state but it was her job to shape the environment for children who could not make their own choices. Dame Sally hinted that she would like to see taxes from unhealthy foods subsidise fruit and vegetables, but acknowledged this was a ""dream"" ""We should not be adding empty calories to baby food,"" Dame Sally said. ""It sets the taste for sweeter food and results in children gaining unnecessary weight before going to primary school."" The report says a health index for the UK is needed to measure all the factors which affect our health and its outcomes in order to see if progress is being made. A spokesman from the Treasury said it would not shy away from further action, including tax changes, if the food industry ""fails to face up to the scale of the problem through voluntary reduction programmes"". Kate Halliwell, head of UK diet and health policy at the Food and Drink Federation, said some manufacturers had been reducing sugar and calorie content in shopping baskets for more than a decade. But she cautioned that changing recipes for food products could not happen overnight. ""Sugar plays a variety of roles beyond sweetness in food including colour, texture and consistency. ""It is for these reasons that we have long said that the guidelines are ambitious and will not be met across all categories or in the timescale outlined."" And she said portion control and product reformulation, rather than taxes, were policies more likely to change consumer behaviour. ""Food and drink companies should focus efforts where they can have the maximum impact, instead of managing the impact of wrong-headed legislation."" Meanwhile, the government has announced Â£3.13bn will be given to councils in England next year for public health initiatives, such as stop smoking services, weight management services and exercise support.

"This video can not be played Victims of the Lockerbie disaster have been remembered A service has taken place in southern Scotland to remember the victims of the Lockerbie bombing 30 years on. Wreaths were laid at a memorial garden in the town to honour the 270 people killed when Pan Am Flight 103 was blown up on 21 December 1988. Jeff Brown, moderator of the presbytery of Annandale and Eskdale, paid tribute to those lost in a ""senseless act"". Eleven people in Lockerbie died along with 259 passengers and crew on board the plane bound for New York. It was the biggest mass murder on British soil in recent history. The majority of those on board the plane which fell on the town in south-west Scotland were American. A new permanent memorial to the victims has also been unveiled at the FBI headquarters in Washington DC. Services were later held at Syracuse University in New York State and Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia. The Lockerbie wreath-laying saw victims' relatives join members of the community who assisted in the aftermath of the atrocity. Mr Brown, who conducted the ceremony at Dryfesdale Cemetery, said: ""We remember loved ones taken in a senseless act of violence, we remember lives, families and communities torn and broken. ""We stand together in the silence and peace of this place in our act of remembrance to keep faith with them."" He also offered thanks for the ""simple acts of kindness"" which had helped to ""ease the pain of loss caused by this callous act"". The town scarred by Pan Am Flight 103 Farmer's tribute to Lockerbie victims Finding words to describe Lockerbie The Lord Lieutenant for Dumfriesshire Fiona Armstrong read out a message from the Queen and paid tribute to the ""remarkable community"" in the town. ""Please convey my warm thanks to the people of Dumfriesshire for their kind message, sent on the occasion of their Remembrance service to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the Lockerbie bombing, which is being held today,"" the Queen said. ""I send my prayers and good wishes to all those who will be marking this solemn anniversary."" Scottish Secretary David Mundell, who is from the town, also attended the service and laid a wreath. The Lockerbie bombing claimed the lives of 270 people on 21 December 1988 ""Lockerbie lost its anonymity that night,"" the MP for Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale and Tweeddale said. ""We went from a quiet small town to a centre of global attention in a few seconds. ""That was the scale of the challenge local people have faced, aside from the horrors of the air disaster itself."" He said the people of Lockerbie had retained their ""dignity and stoicism"" throughout and said ""strengthening and deepening"" the relationships forged with the US should be a priority. A memorial cairn to the victims stands in the Arlington National Cemetery A ceremony will be held at the site in Virginia First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the victims of the bombing would always be remembered. ""Thinking today of Lockerbie and all those whose lives were lost or deeply affected by what happened on this day 30 years ago, "" she said. ""We will never forget."" Prime Minister Theresa May also tweeted: ""Today we remember those who died in the Lockerbie bombing 30 years ago. ""On this tragic anniversary, my thoughts are with the families of those who lost their lives and the Lockerbie community."" Eleven people in Lockerbie died along with 259 passengers and crew from the plane A Walk of Peace has also been arranged to mark the 30th anniversary of the disaster In the US, a plaque unveiled at a ceremony at the FBI headquarters in Washington revealed the bombing ""transformed how the FBI investigates terrorism, works with international partners and cares for victims"". Scotland's top law officer Alison Di Rollo was among 400 guests at the service, where she pledged to work in close co-operation with the US authorities if new evidence on the attack became available. It is still under investigation by a team of Scottish prosecutors. Ms Di Rollo, Scotland's solicitor general, said: ""As a prosecutor I cannot guarantee that the current investigation will uncover enough evidence to support criminal proceedings but I can - and do - promise that the Lord Advocate and I, along with the prosecution team and the Police Service of Scotland, will remain committed to this investigation and to working as closely as we ever have with our US colleagues."" Syracuse University remembered its victims at a memorial service and there was also a service at Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia, where a cairn made from Lockerbie stone stands in memory of those who died. Bombing victim tribute cycle ride 'worth it' Lockerbie girl mystery 'laid to rest' 'No criminality' in handling of investigation Back in Scotland, a Walk of Peace has been arranged by the Church of Scotland on Saturday to remember those who died. People will climb Burnswark Hill near Lockerbie in silence following a special service at Tundergarth Parish Church the previous day. The only person ever to be convicted of the bombing, Abdelbaset al-Megrahi, died in 2012 after being released from Greenock jail on compassionate grounds. His family is currently making a third attempt to appeal against his conviction. The Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission is considering whether there are grounds to refer his case to the appeal court.

"Kathy Griffin has criticised the lack of women onForbes magazine's latest list,externalof the world's best-paid comedians. The Emmy Award-winning comediantweeted the top 10 of Forbes' list,externalalong with the words: ""No Women."" Jerry Seinfeld topped the rankings with estimated earnings of $57.5m (Â£45.3m). Amy Schumer was the first woman to make the list last year but has dropped back out this time. Ricky Gervais is the only British comedian on the list. He is a new entry in fifth place with earnings of $25m (Â£19.7m). Forbes said that was thanks to Humanity, his first stand-up tour for five years. Humanity was also on Netflix, and he has signed up for another Netflix special. Griffin, meanwhile, was unlikely to make the list herself. She was fired by CNN and said she lost a number of other jobs after sheposed with a fake decapitated head of President Donald Trumpin May 2017. Jerry Seinfeld and Kevin Hart are in first and second places Another comedian missing from the list is Louis CK, who was in last year's top 10 with $52m (Â£41m) earnings. But after heconfirmed sexual misconduct allegations against himin November 2017, his second Netflix special was cancelled and he has only performed ahandful of dates since. Seinfeld has topped the list in all but one year since it was first compiled in 2006. Kevin Hart took the top spot in 2016. Forbes attributes Seinfeld's earnings this year to his 2017 Netflix deal and Hulu's streaming rights to all nine seasons of Seinfeld, as well as more than $30m (Â£23.6m) from stand-up. Hart is close behind in second place with $57m (Â£44.9m). The comedian, who recentlypulled out of hosting the Oscarsdue to controversy over homophobic tweets, also earned more than $30m from touring and starred in the Jumanji film remake.

"Rogue drones ""deliberately"" flown over one of the UK's busiest airports caused travel chaos before Christmas. Heathrow, among the world's busiest airports, was also briefly disrupted by drone activity in January. At Gatwick, incoming planes were forced to divert to airports up and down the country as the drones, or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), repeatedly appeared over the airfield. The situation was so serious the Army was called in to support the local police in tackling the issue, with the runway finally re-opening several days later. For some time now, governments around the world have been looking at different ways of addressing the dangers of drone use in areas where they pose safety risks. Here we look at some of the solutions - ranging from bazookas to eagles. London's Gatwick Airport was forced to close after drones were spotted over the airfield Rogue drones can be detected or located using cameras, radar and radio frequency sensors. Such technology can be integrated into existing airport systems and can have a reach of several miles. It can then be used to effectively ""jam"" the communication between a device and its operator, causing it to initiate a default mode that sends it back to where it came from. Fighting back against rogue drones How can a drone cause so much chaos? One company that has developed this method is Quantum Aviation, which provided the technology to counter possible threats from drones targeting the London 2012 Olympics. China has also developed a signal-jamming gun that can reportedly down drones from half a mile away. The SkyWall100 bazooka allows users to physically seize drones in high-risk areas One way, and perhaps the most obvious, is to shoot them down. But police dealing with the issue at Gatwick Airport have said they will not use this method because of the risk of stray bullets. However, a number of companies have produced hand-held or shoulder-mounted devices that can be used to fire nets at rogue drones, trapping them and preventing the blades from rotating, causing them to fall from the sky. British engineering company OpenWorks has also developed a large bazooka, the SkyWall100, which fires a net and parachute at a target, using a scope for accuracy. The SkyWall100 system has been issued to security forces and government agencies in Asia, Europe and North America. Security firms have also found a way of using ""interceptor drones"" that can lock onto a target, release a net and disable it in mid-air. This type of system was deployed at the Winter Olympics in South Korea in February, and has been used by police in Tokyo for the last three years. France has also used this technique, successfully demonstrating that one drone equipped with a net can catch another. This video can not be played Boeing is testing a high-powered laser Lasers are another option: both the US and China have experimented with technology that can shoot down a device within seconds of locating it. Engineering company Boeing has developed a high-energy beam that locates and disables small drones from several miles away. It is said to use infrared cameras that can work in low visibility, such as fog. Earlier this year, China demonstrated a laser gun at a weapons exhibition in Kazakhstan. The so-called ""Silent Hunter"" was claimed to be effective in helping police intercept drones and other small aerial targets with ""high accuracy"". This video can not be played The BBC has been given access to the airbase where Dutch police are training eagles to take down unauthorised drones Meanwhile, the Netherlands has discovered a low-tech solution to the high-tech problem. Police there have trained eagles to bring down ""hostile"" drones by latching on to the propellers with their talons, instantly disabling them. Trainers say the eagles see the drones as prey and are not interested in attacking anything else when released. Dutch police are believed to be the first in the world to have implemented this method. It is already illegal to fly a drone within 1km (about 1,100 yards) of an airport or airfield boundary in the UK - but regulations in other countries vary. Drone users in the US have to notify air traffic control in advance if they plan to fly their devices within 8km of an airport. All drones must also be registered, according to the drone community website UAV Coach. In Canada, drones cannot be flown within 5.6km of any airport, seaplane base or area where aircraft can take off and land. This is reduced to 1.9km for heliports. Similar laws apply in Sweden. Permits are also required in Germany - although the restrictions for airport boundaries are similar to those in the UK, at 1.5km - and Spain, where devices must also be insured. Laws in South Africa, however, are strict. It is illegal to fly devices within 10km of an airport, helipad or airstrip, and they can only be operated elsewhere during daylight hours and in clear conditions. In 15 countries, including Saudi Arabia and Iraq, it is illegal to fly a drone at all.

"Boris Johnson has been cleared of breaking the Tories' code of conduct with comments he made about women wearing burkas. He had written that they looked liked ""letter boxes"" or ""bank robbers"" ina Telegraph column,externalin which he argued against a ban on full-face veils. It prompted dozens of complaints but it is understood an independent panel said he had been ""respectful and tolerant"". Tory chairman Brandon Lewis and Theresa May had called on him to apologise. Responding to the news, the Muslim Council of Britain, an umbrella body for 500 mosques, schools and associations, said it failed to see how Mr Johnson's comments ""were 'respectful' and 'tolerant' as the panel has concluded"". The group claimed Mr Johnson's column had led ""to copycat verbal assaults against Muslim women"". Criticism grows of Johnson's burka jibe Why some Muslim women wear the veil The founder of the Conservative Muslim Forum, Lord Sheikh, wrote to Mr Lewis after Mr Johnson wrote the column in August, demanding ""serious action"". The Conservative Party has been accused of not doing enough to tackle anti-Muslim prejudice in its ranks, despite an initiative to boost tolerance and diversity. Theparty's code of conduct,externalstates that Tory officials and elected representatives must ""lead by example to encourage and foster respect and tolerance"" and not ""use their position to bully, abuse, victimise, harass or unlawfully discriminate against others"". The complaints were looked at by an independent panel which could have referred Mr Johnson to the party's board, which has the power to expel him. But the panel has cleared him of breaching the code. Friends of the former foreign secretary said the inquiry had found his newspaper article fostered ""respect and tolerance"" for the wearing of the burka.The Daily Telegraph,externalalso quotes allies of Mr Johnson urging Brandon Lewis to apologise. A Conservative Party spokesman said: ""The investigation into complaints received regarding an article written by Mr Johnson has concluded.

UK drone users face safety tests or fines Endangering the safety of an aircraft is a criminal offence which can carry a prison sentence of up to five years. The governmentpassed legislation earlier this year,externalmaking it illegal to fly a drone within 1km of an airport or airfield boundary in the UK. Flying above 400ft (120m) - which increases the risk of a collision with manned aircraft - was also banned as of 30 July. Users who break the flight restrictions could face unlimited fines, up to five years in prison, or both. But the government has been considering other proposals as part of its draft Drone Bill following a rise in the number of near-misses with aircraft. The bill is due to be published early next year. Operators of drones weighing 250g or more will be required toregister with the Civil Aviation Authority,externalfrom November 2019, as well as having to take an online safety test. Some drones, usually cheaper models, weigh less than 250g. But most - especially those with built-in cameras - weigh more. Previously the regulations had applied to aircraft that weighed 20kg or less. Children could also be bannedfrom owning drones which weigh more than 250g. They would only be allowed to fly devices heavier than that if they were owned and registered by an adult. Other proposals being considered include giving police the power to confiscate drones and issue on-the-spot fines to irresponsible pilots. Aviation minister Baroness Suggwrote in the Daily Telegraph,externalthat the government would be publishing its response to the consultation ""soon"". She added: ""We are taking things a step further. We've consulted widely and will be strengthening those existing rules even more."" No, according to Chris Daw QC, from Serjeants' Inn Chambers, but he says there is an argument for increasing the maximum five-year sentence for the existing offence. He says: ""It's not a huge deterrent for someone who intends to cause three days of major disruption to an international airport. ""This incident has exposed that the law doesn't have enough teeth to deal with behaviour which is incredibly disruptive and reckless."" He says even possessing a drone within a certain distance of an airfield should be considered an offence. ""The law should be made as strict as possible as the consequences could be so calamitous,"" he adds. However, Richard Garside, director of the Centre for Crime and Justice Studies, says threatening longer sentences isn't the answer. He says the industry should follow the example of car manufacturers - which have reduced car crime dramatically since the 1990s by improving security features - and find a technological solution.

"US troops are part of a Nato-led mission to train and assist Afghan forces The Trump administration is planning to withdraw thousands of troops from Afghanistan, US media say. Reports, citing unnamed officials, say about 7,000 troops - roughly half the remaining US military presence in the country - could go home within months. The reports come a day after the president announced the country's military withdrawal from Syria. Earlier on Thursday,Mr Trump's Defence Secretary Jim Mattis announced his resignationfrom his post. Reports about the sharp reduction of forces emerged on Thursday, but have not been confirmed by US defence officials. Analysts have warned that a withdrawal could have a ""devastating"" impact and offer Taliban militants a propaganda victory. A Taliban official told AFP news agency: ""Frankly speaking, we weren't expecting that immediate US response... we are more than happy."" Trump's erratic foreign policy course Why Afghanistan is more dangerous than ever The White House revolving door The Taliban - a hardline Islamist movement that carries out frequent suicide bombings and attacks against government and military targets - is active in much of Afghanistan. They ruled Afghanistan from 1996-2001, imposing a brutal version of Sharia law, including public executions and amputations, and banned women from public life. The US has been in Afghanistan since 2001, after the 11 September attacks. It is the longest war in US history, and hasclaimed more than 2,300 American lives.,external When the Taliban, who controlled Afghanistan, refused to hand over al-Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden - who said he had organised the 11 September attack - then US President George W Bush launched a military operation to find Bin Laden and remove the Taliban from power. US special forces eventually found and killed Bin Laden in Pakistan in 2011. American-led combat operations in Afghanistan officially ended in 2014. US troops have been in Afghanistan for 17 years But in the years since then, the Taliban's power and reach have soared - and US troops have stayed on the ground in an effort to stabilise the country. Before his election, Mr Trump repeatedly publicly advocated leaving Afghanistan, describing it as a waste of money. However, last year he indicated he would keep boots on the ground indefinitely to prevent the country's collapse, and said the US would send 3,000 extra troops to the country. Counting the cost of Trump's air war in Afghanistan Viewpoint: Why the US should withdraw from Afghanistan Who are the Taliban? Afghan officials have insisted they are not concerned about the reported withdrawal. ""The fact that a few thousand foreign troops whose roles are primarily advisory and technical support will exit from Afghanistan will not have an impact on security situation,"" presidential spokesman Harun Chukhansori told the BBC's Afghan service. He added that ""Afghan security forces have had full responsibility of security affairs"" since 2014. However,a recent US military report says Taliban control over Afghanistan has increased,externalin recent months, and the government currently controls or influences only 55.5% of the country's districts - the lowest level recorded since it began tracking the data in 2015. Earlier this week, Afghan President Ashraf Ghani emphasised that Afghan security forces had borne the highest casualties in the battle against the Taliban. Trump rewrites US Syria policy Taliban threaten 70% of Afghanistan, BBC finds ""We are not only dying for our own freedom, but for your security,"" he told the BBC's Today programme. ""The daily operations, the fighting and the dying is done by us."" He added that his country did not want ""charity"" from the US, but a ""partnership that is meaningful"". ""Countries don't have permanent friends or permanent enemies, they have permanent interests,"" he said. ""The US is here because of its global and national security interests."" By Auliya Atrafi, BBC Afghan service, Mazar-e Sharif On the frontline of the conflict in the north, there's been no let-up in the fighting, even though peace talks have been going on. Security forces I spoke to here said they wouldn't feel the effect of pulling out 7,000 US troops, as long as the US continued its weapon of choice - air support. They may have a point. More than 100,000 US troops were withdrawn in 2014. Since then, Afghan forces have had responsibility for security - but they have also lost lots of ground. While any US troop reduction might not affect current anti-Taliban operations, it would be seen as a positive hint to the militants who have been demanding all US troops leave. Thousands of Afghans displaced by the war fear they may never return home. For them and many others, a withdrawal would be welcomed if it helped peace talks. The Washington Post reportsthe potential move is being met with opposition by some of Mr Trump's senior cabinet officials,external, including outgoing White House Chief of Staff John Kelly and National Security Adviser John Bolton. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said the withdrawal could pave the way towards ""a second 9/11"". Earlier this year, the Taliban claimed a suicide bomb attack outside a compound in Kabul ""The conditions in Afghanistan make American troop withdrawals a high risk strategy,"" he said on Twitter.,external""We are setting in motion the loss of all our gains."" Meanwhile, Michael Kugelman, deputy director of the Asia programme at the US think-tank Wilson Center, said the impact of the withdrawal could be ""devastating"" and ""would be a soaring propaganda victory for the Taliban, as it could boast that it managed to expel US troops even without a peace deal"". ""It [would also] be a major psychological blow for Afghan forces. They have struggled mightily and [this] would be quite demoralising,"" he told the BBC. It appears that US allies were not made aware of the potential withdrawal. The UK's chief of the defence staff, General Sir Nick Carter, spoke to the BBC's Today programme during a visit to Afghanistan this week, before the latest media reports emerged. He told the BBC: ""Everything I've seen during my visit over the last 24 hours would suggest they're wholeheartedly committed to this mission, as is Nato and the international community."" In his letter of departure on Thursday, General Mattis strongly hinted at policy differences with the president, but did not cite troop withdrawals directly. The possibility of withdrawing from Afghanistan could have been a factor but the Syria withdrawal was likely to have been the ""main trigger"", says Mr Kugelman. However, the general's departure is likely to have an impact on the Trump administration's future Afghan policy. A successor will take over from General Mattis in February ""He's one of the only remaining senior officials in the administration who supports a continued US military presence in Afghanistan,"" said Mr Kugelman. ""Now that Mattis is on his way out, Trump will face even less resistance in his decision to withdraw troops.""

"An Indian man has been arrested for allegedly raping and robbing a British tourist in the western state of Goa. The woman, 48, was attacked around 4:00 local time (22:30 GMT) on Thursday as she was walking to her hotel from a railway station, police told PTI news. The accused is a man from the southern state of Tamil Nadu. He fled after also taking three of her bags. Goa is one of India's top tourist destinations and its beaches attract thousands of foreigners every year. The woman is a regular visitor to the state. Police said she had been going there every year for the last 10 years. Police were able to track down the suspect with the help of CCTV footage from the railway station as well as the area where the crime occurred, according to the NDTV news website. Why India's rape crisis shows no signs of abating rA rape victim's two-year wait for justice This is one of several crimes against foreigners in the state. An Irish woman, Danielle McLaughlin, was raped and murdered while on holiday in Goa in 2017. Vikhat Bhagat, 24, was arrested soon after her murder and his trial, which began in April, is still under way. Scarlett Keeling was killed in Goa in 2008 In 2008,Scarlett Keeling, a 15-year-old British teenager was raped and killedwhile on a trip in Goa. Her killers are yet to be caught. Two men who had faced charges of culpable homicide and grievous sexual assault were both cleared in 2016. Public outrage over sexual violence in India rose dramatically after the 2012 gang rape and murder of a student on a Delhi bus. This year has seen the issue become a political flashpoint again, after a string of high-profile attacks against children. However incidents of rape and violence against women continue to be reported from across the country.

"This video can not be played Victims of the Lockerbie disaster have been remembered A service has taken place in southern Scotland to remember the victims of the Lockerbie bombing 30 years on. Wreaths were laid at a memorial garden in the town to honour the 270 people killed when Pan Am Flight 103 was blown up on 21 December 1988. Jeff Brown, moderator of the presbytery of Annandale and Eskdale, paid tribute to those lost in a ""senseless act"". Eleven people in Lockerbie died along with 259 passengers and crew on board the plane bound for New York. It was the biggest mass murder on British soil in recent history. The majority of those on board the plane which fell on the town in south-west Scotland were American. A new permanent memorial to the victims has also been unveiled at the FBI headquarters in Washington DC. Services were later held at Syracuse University in New York State and Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia. The Lockerbie wreath-laying saw victims' relatives join members of the community who assisted in the aftermath of the atrocity. Mr Brown, who conducted the ceremony at Dryfesdale Cemetery, said: ""We remember loved ones taken in a senseless act of violence, we remember lives, families and communities torn and broken. ""We stand together in the silence and peace of this place in our act of remembrance to keep faith with them."" He also offered thanks for the ""simple acts of kindness"" which had helped to ""ease the pain of loss caused by this callous act"". The town scarred by Pan Am Flight 103 Farmer's tribute to Lockerbie victims Finding words to describe Lockerbie The Lord Lieutenant for Dumfriesshire Fiona Armstrong read out a message from the Queen and paid tribute to the ""remarkable community"" in the town. ""Please convey my warm thanks to the people of Dumfriesshire for their kind message, sent on the occasion of their Remembrance service to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the Lockerbie bombing, which is being held today,"" the Queen said. ""I send my prayers and good wishes to all those who will be marking this solemn anniversary."" Scottish Secretary David Mundell, who is from the town, also attended the service and laid a wreath. The Lockerbie bombing claimed the lives of 270 people on 21 December 1988 ""Lockerbie lost its anonymity that night,"" the MP for Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale and Tweeddale said. ""We went from a quiet small town to a centre of global attention in a few seconds. ""That was the scale of the challenge local people have faced, aside from the horrors of the air disaster itself."" He said the people of Lockerbie had retained their ""dignity and stoicism"" throughout and said ""strengthening and deepening"" the relationships forged with the US should be a priority. A memorial cairn to the victims stands in the Arlington National Cemetery A ceremony will be held at the site in Virginia First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the victims of the bombing would always be remembered. ""Thinking today of Lockerbie and all those whose lives were lost or deeply affected by what happened on this day 30 years ago, "" she said. ""We will never forget."" Prime Minister Theresa May also tweeted: ""Today we remember those who died in the Lockerbie bombing 30 years ago. ""On this tragic anniversary, my thoughts are with the families of those who lost their lives and the Lockerbie community."" Eleven people in Lockerbie died along with 259 passengers and crew from the plane A Walk of Peace has also been arranged to mark the 30th anniversary of the disaster In the US, a plaque unveiled at a ceremony at the FBI headquarters in Washington revealed the bombing ""transformed how the FBI investigates terrorism, works with international partners and cares for victims"". Scotland's top law officer Alison Di Rollo was among 400 guests at the service, where she pledged to work in close co-operation with the US authorities if new evidence on the attack became available. It is still under investigation by a team of Scottish prosecutors. Ms Di Rollo, Scotland's solicitor general, said: ""As a prosecutor I cannot guarantee that the current investigation will uncover enough evidence to support criminal proceedings but I can - and do - promise that the Lord Advocate and I, along with the prosecution team and the Police Service of Scotland, will remain committed to this investigation and to working as closely as we ever have with our US colleagues."" Syracuse University remembered its victims at a memorial service and there was also a service at Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia, where a cairn made from Lockerbie stone stands in memory of those who died. Bombing victim tribute cycle ride 'worth it' Lockerbie girl mystery 'laid to rest' 'No criminality' in handling of investigation Back in Scotland, a Walk of Peace has been arranged by the Church of Scotland on Saturday to remember those who died. People will climb Burnswark Hill near Lockerbie in silence following a special service at Tundergarth Parish Church the previous day. The only person ever to be convicted of the bombing, Abdelbaset al-Megrahi, died in 2012 after being released from Greenock jail on compassionate grounds.

"The boy, whose photo has been blurred, was admitted to Bristol Royal Hospital for Children to treat an undescended testicle A two-year-old boy has been left infertile after surgeons operated on the wrong testicle, his family says. The boy was admitted to Bristol Royal Hospital for Children earlier in the week to treat an undescended testicle. He had one healthy testicle and one that did not function. His father said surgeons operated on the wrong one by mistake and have ""castrated him"". University Hospitals Bristol has apologised and said it has launched a serious incident investigation. The boy's father, whose name has not been used to protect his son's identity, said his son's undescended testicle was discovered during a routine check up. The toddler boy was referred to a specialist and on Monday he was booked in for an operation at the Bristol Royal Hospital for Children. The family said they were told it was ""just a minimal operation"" with ""minimal risk"" and it would be over in around 30 minutes ""We were waiting and waiting,"" his father said. ""After two and a half hours the manager, surgeons and consultants they came and I knew something was not right. ""Me and my wife started panicking, they called us into the office and told us things didn't go right and the operation wasn't a success."" The operation took place at the Bristol Children's Hospital The couple said they were told a surgeon had mistakenly inserted a camera ""into the wrong side"" and now their son's healthy testicle would ""never work"". ""I was very distressed, it was an awful disaster for a simple operation they destroyed everything and they ruined my son,"" his father said. ""They castrated him and now my son's future life has dramatically changed."" The boy's mother said it was ""absolutely horrible"" what the surgeons had done. ""They broke my heart and they basically destroyed his future,"" she said. ""I can't find the words to explain how I'm feeling - there are no words. Even tears, I have no more tears. ""We just hope for a miracle, this is what we hope."" In a statement, University Hospitals Bristol apologised saying it was ""deeply sorry"". ""As soon as our staff members realised what had happened, they met with the family, told them what happened, and apologised again at that point,"" a spokesperson said. ""I would like to re-iterate that we take patient safety extremely seriously here and also the quality of our clinical care. ""As a result, a serious incident investigation has been launched. We will keep the family informed and involved in this process.""

"NHS England is making up to Â£300,000 available over the festive period to fund dozens of ""drunk tanks"". These supervised units are places where revellers who have over-indulged can be checked and allowed to sleep it off. They should help take the pressure off hospital and 999 services over the busy Christmas and new year period. Some will open later for ""Booze Black Friday"", the last Friday before Christmas, when drink sales usually peak as many office parties are held. Many will be operational on New Year's Eve. The areas that are getting funding for drunk tanks include Soho in central London, Exeter, Bristol, Oxford, Hereford, Norwich, Blackpool and Southampton. Most of these areas already provide drunk tanks in their city or town centres on Fridays and Saturdays and the funding will enable them to expand their services over the holiday season. Drunk people who need more urgent medical care will still be taken to hospital when necessary. Are parents prepared for holiday hangovers? Uber applies for patent to spot drunk passengers How commonly do drinkers suffer blackouts? About one in seven patients who go to an accident and emergency unit is very drunk and caring for them takes staff away from other patients. This rises to as many as seven in every 10 patients on a Friday or Saturday night. NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens said: ""NHS does not stand for 'National Hangover Service', which is why we want to help other organisations take care of those who just need somewhere safe to get checked over and perhaps sleep it off."" A number of cities have already introduced drunk tanks Bristol launched the UK's first drunk tank four years ago. Since then, services have been rolled out to other cities and towns across the UK, including Cardiff and Belfast, but not in Scotland. NHS England soon could roll out more of them. A study looking into how effective they are is due to come out in 2019. Drunk tanks are often funded by charities and run in partnership with the police, the ambulance service and local hospitals. The South Central Ambulance Service is again running its SOS Service in Oxford using a dedicated ""jumbulance"", or large ambulance. Last year, the team saw 63 patients. Of these, only 14 required further treatment and/or assessment at the John Radcliffe Hospital. Paramedic and team member Craig Heigold said: ""The SOS Project provides a valuable service at a time of peak demand for all local NHS and emergency services in Oxford city centre. ""By doing so, we can reduce the demand on our colleagues at A&E, as well as ensure that more Oxfordshire SCAS staff and vehicles are free to respond to non-alcohol related illnesses and injuries elsewhere in the city and surrounding areas. ""We can also provide a faster and more effective response to patients in the city centre who need us.""

"Beefeaters and other iconic uniformed staff will picket the gates of the Tower of London Beefeaters at the Tower of London are going on strike for the first time in 55 years in a row over their pensions. Jewel house wardens and staff will picket at some of the UK's historic royal palaces including the Tower of London and Hampton Court Palace. About 120 staff are being moved from final salary pensions onto an ""inferior"" model, the GMB union said. ""None of our sites will be closing as a result"" said John Barnes, chief executive of Historic Royal Palaces. The three-hour walkouts will also take place at Kensington Palace from 11:30 GMT on Friday, 28 December and 2 January by members of the Public and Commercial Services Union. A separate strike by GMB workers will take place on 8 January. The new scheme will affect 11% of staff across the Historic Royal Palaces Mr Barnes said: ""We have already offered substantial compensation and transition arrangements to the 11% of our staff who are affected. ""The benefits they have already accrued will be fully protected, and they will be transferred onto the same competitive defined contribution scheme as the other 89% of their colleagues in April 2019."" The strike ""will not change our decision"", Mr Barnes added. Gatwick runway reopens after disruption Royal couples snapshot 'like lottery win' Minicabs to pay London congestion charge The GMB said 91% of its members supported walking out after a turnout of 88%. Michael Ainsley, GMB regional organiser, said: ""Historic Royal Palaces are jumping on a bandwagon which is seeing employers engaging in a race to the bottom, ending good final salary schemes and replacing them with risky cheaper defined contribution schemes. ""GMB members still at this late stage are willing to talk to Historic Royal Palaces but the silence is deafening."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Gatwick's runway has now reopened but police are yet to find the drone operator Passengers waiting at Gatwick airport for flights abroad say they are frustrated and upset that Christmas plans have been ruined by rogue drones being flown over the runway. About 140 flights have been cancelled, leaving hundreds of thousands of passengers unable to leave the country and others unable to get home. Lauran O'Neill says her daughter Emeli ""cried all day"" after their trip to Finland to see Santa was cancelled Lauran O'Neill and her family were due to fly to Finland to see Santa, huskies, reindeer and the Northern Lights. The nurse, from Harrow in London, and her husband Alex Tran, saved all year for the trip to Saariselka. ""We saved all year for this family trip. We will receive no compensation for flights and insurance is difficult as Finnair did not officially cancel the flight. ""I was not doing physical Christmas gifts as this was going to be the experience of a lifetime for my children. ""The whole family is devastated and my kids have been inconsolable. My five-year old daughter Emeli said Santa must not exist to have all these children crying. ""She came home and threw his invite letter in the bin. ""We have worked overtime for the last four months to give them [this trip] and to have that dissipate is so unfair for them. Emeli cried for the whole day when she found out. ""We are trying to cobble things together to make Christmas not so bad and our family and friends have been amazing.""

""I'm grateful that they cancelled all the flights because I wouldn't want to be on a flight when there is some sort of threat. ""Who knows what could be inside a drone? It can seem like nothing but it could also be super dangerous. ""I would rather be safe."" Ms Andren eventually opted to fly to Copenhagen and get a train from there after being told the earliest flight to Gothenburg would be on Christmas Day. She struck up a friendship with fellow Swede Linnea Stromberg, 22, from Stockholm, whose Gatwick-bound flight from New York ended up being diverted to Doncaster. ""We landed in Doncaster which was a tiny little airport and they seemed surprised there when such a big plane landed. ""But they dealt with it quite well and then they put us on a bus to Gatwick. I came here at 18:00 on Thursday. ""I waited in line until 22:00 then camped out by the Christmas tree. ""A year ago I was due to fly through Heathrow and they shut it due to the weather, so I probably won't fly through London next Christmas. ""I understand that this seems like a big deal out of nothing but there was nothing really else the airport authorities could do. ""If I get on my flight, I will be grateful.""

Ms Grech, who has type 1 diabetes, adrenal insufficiency, Sheehan's syndrome and sleep apnoea, said she will be missing Christmas with her family in East Sussex. ""I'm desperately trying to get back to see my son for Christmas,"" she says. ""We were in the Dominican on my bucket list holiday as I don't know if I can fly long haul again due to medical issues."" She is trying to find out if she can source more medication while abroad, but added: ""Thank god I brought enough insulin, growth hormone and life-saving steroids and emergency injections.""

"Defence Secretary James Mattis will leave the administration in February US Defence Secretary James Mattis is resigning, the latest in a string of senior US officials to do so. His announcement came a day after President Trump said he was withdrawing troops from Syria - a decision General Mattis is understood to oppose. In his resignation letter, Gen Mattis strongly hinted at policy differences with Mr Trump. He said the president had the right to appoint someone ""whose views are better aligned with yours"". Gen Mattis, 68, will leave the job in February. President Trump has not immediately named a successor, but said one would be appointed shortly. Trump's erratic foreign policy course White House revolving door: Who's gone? Members of Congress from both sides of the political divide have reacted with shock to the resignation. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, from Mr Trump's own Republican Party, said he was ""distressed"" to hear the resignation was reportedly due to ""sharp differences"" that Gen Mattis had with the president. Gen Mattis alluded to disagreements with the president in a number of policy areas. In his letter, addressed to Mr Trump directly, he described his views on ""treating allies with respect"" and using ""all the tools of American power to provide for the common defence"". ""Because you have the right to have a Secretary of Defense whose views are better aligned with yours on these and other subjects, I believe it is right for me to step down from my position,"" he wrote. Read the resignation letter in full This video can not be played ""One bridge too far"": Former US Defence Secretary William Cohen reacts to Mattis' resignation While not mentioning the Syria troop pull-out directly, Gen Mattis had previously warned that an early withdrawal from the country would be a ""strategic blunder"". He also appeared to point to differences on a number of other key issues, including Russia and Nato. ""My views on treating allies with respect and also being clear-eyed about both malign actors and strategic competitors are strongly held and informed by over four decades of immersion in these issues,"" Gen Mattis wrote. He confirmed he would continue in the role until the end of February to ""allow sufficient time for a successor to be nominated and confirmed"". Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington Donald Trump may try to spin James Mattis's departure as a retirement after a lifetime of government service. It's not. This is a protest resignation, plain and simple. The defence secretary's letter to the president - in which he offers full-throated support for a US network of alliances and calls for a policy of containment of authoritarian rivals - makes that perfectly clear. The timing of this announcement, just a day after Mr Trump abruptly ordered the withdrawal of US troops from Syria and amid rumours of an Afghanistan pullout, should also dispel any doubt about stark policy differences between the two men. Gen Mattis had positioned himself as one of the cooler heads throughout the president's term - considered by Democrats and Republicans alike as a ""grown-up"" in the room and a far cry from the ""Mad Dog Mattis"" nickname that so enamoured Mr Trump. From his Pentagon office across the Potomac River from the White House, he managed to stay largely above the fray, frequently assuaging the concerns of US allies unnerved by some of the president's more intemperate statements. Now that check on the president, one of the last few remaining, is heading out, suggesting turbulent waters ahead. Florida Senator Marco Rubio, who ran against Mr Trump for the Republican nomination in 2016, said the letter ""makes it abundantly clear that we are headed towards a series of grave policy errors which will endanger our nation, damage our alliances & empower our adversaries"". Mr McConnell tweeted his statement responding to the announcement. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"An Indian man has been arrested for allegedly raping and robbing a British tourist in the western state of Goa. The woman, 48, was attacked around 4:00 local time (22:30 GMT) on Thursday as she was walking to her hotel from a railway station, police told PTI news. The accused is a man from the southern state of Tamil Nadu. He fled after also taking three of her bags. Goa is one of India's top tourist destinations and its beaches attract thousands of foreigners every year. The woman is a regular visitor to the state. Police said she had been going there every year for the last 10 years. Police were able to track down the suspect with the help of CCTV footage from the railway station as well as the area where the crime occurred, according to the NDTV news website. Why India's rape crisis shows no signs of abating rA rape victim's two-year wait for justice This is one of several crimes against foreigners in the state. An Irish woman, Danielle McLaughlin, was raped and murdered while on holiday in Goa in 2017. Vikhat Bhagat, 24, was arrested soon after her murder and his trial, which began in April, is still under way. Scarlett Keeling was killed in Goa in 2008 In 2008,Scarlett Keeling, a 15-year-old British teenager was raped and killedwhile on a trip in Goa. Her killers are yet to be caught. Two men who had faced charges of culpable homicide and grievous sexual assault were both cleared in 2016. Public outrage over sexual violence in India rose dramatically after the 2012 gang rape and murder of a student on a Delhi bus. This year has seen the issue become a political flashpoint again, after a string of high-profile attacks against children. However incidents of rape and violence against women continue to be reported from across the country.

"NHS England is making up to Â£300,000 available over the festive period to fund dozens of ""drunk tanks"". These supervised units are places where revellers who have over-indulged can be checked and allowed to sleep it off. They should help take the pressure off hospital and 999 services over the busy Christmas and new year period. Some will open later for ""Booze Black Friday"", the last Friday before Christmas, when drink sales usually peak as many office parties are held. Many will be operational on New Year's Eve. The areas that are getting funding for drunk tanks include Soho in central London, Exeter, Bristol, Oxford, Hereford, Norwich, Blackpool and Southampton. Most of these areas already provide drunk tanks in their city or town centres on Fridays and Saturdays and the funding will enable them to expand their services over the holiday season. Drunk people who need more urgent medical care will still be taken to hospital when necessary. Are parents prepared for holiday hangovers? Uber applies for patent to spot drunk passengers How commonly do drinkers suffer blackouts? About one in seven patients who go to an accident and emergency unit is very drunk and caring for them takes staff away from other patients. This rises to as many as seven in every 10 patients on a Friday or Saturday night. NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens said: ""NHS does not stand for 'National Hangover Service', which is why we want to help other organisations take care of those who just need somewhere safe to get checked over and perhaps sleep it off."" A number of cities have already introduced drunk tanks Bristol launched the UK's first drunk tank four years ago. Since then, services have been rolled out to other cities and towns across the UK, including Cardiff and Belfast, but not in Scotland. NHS England soon could roll out more of them. A study looking into how effective they are is due to come out in 2019. Drunk tanks are often funded by charities and run in partnership with the police, the ambulance service and local hospitals. The South Central Ambulance Service is again running its SOS Service in Oxford using a dedicated ""jumbulance"", or large ambulance. Last year, the team saw 63 patients. Of these, only 14 required further treatment and/or assessment at the John Radcliffe Hospital. Paramedic and team member Craig Heigold said: ""The SOS Project provides a valuable service at a time of peak demand for all local NHS and emergency services in Oxford city centre. ""By doing so, we can reduce the demand on our colleagues at A&E, as well as ensure that more Oxfordshire SCAS staff and vehicles are free to respond to non-alcohol related illnesses and injuries elsewhere in the city and surrounding areas. ""We can also provide a faster and more effective response to patients in the city centre who need us.""

"Businesses that trade with the EU need to take steps now to prepare for the possibility of a no-deal Brexit, a government minister has warned. Financial Secretary to the Treasury Mel Stride told the BBC's Today programme ""there is a call to action now"". HMRC haspublished an update to its advice,externalon how firms should prepare for a no-deal scenario. However, Mr Stride called the prospect of the UK leaving the EU without a deal an ""unlikely event"". Speaking to the BBC, Mr Stride said: ""The time is now, there is a call to action now. ""Those who are importing or exporting into and out of the EU 27, in the unlikely event that there is a no-deal at the end of March, will need to take certain steps. They need to do that now."" Deal or no deal? EU bewildered by Brexit confusion Brexit: A simple guide What can New Zealand teach us about Brexit? Mr Stride said businesses needed to ""get a customs agent on board"" or ""look at software they can use to make sure (of) their import and export declarations"". He added that firms should register for an Economic Operators Registration and Identification Number (EORI number) -  a system of unique identification numbers used by customs authorities throughout the European Union. Businesses should also be prepared to pay custom duties in the event of a no-deal Brexit, he warned. The latest HMRC update marks a shift in tone, with businesses being urged to take action now. The new version of the partnership pack also includes details about government funding for new IT systems and staff training, which is available to customs brokers, customs intermediaries and traders. Nimisha Raja, chief executive and founder of Nim's Fruit Crisps On Wednesday,British business groups criticised politicians for focusing on infightingrather than preparing for Brexit, warning that there was not enough time to prepare for a no-deal scenario. The groups said companies had been ""watching in horror"" at the continuing rows within Westminster. Nimisha Raja, chief executive and founder of Nim's Fruit Crisps, says businesses need to be prepared for a lot more paperwork, if there is a no-deal Brexit. Nim's Fruit Crisps sometimes has to import fruit from the EU to make its products, when fruits such as apples and pears are out of season in the UK. ""I hadn't realised quite how much we would need to do,"" she told the BBC. Preparing for the changes in the import procedure was ""quite an onerous task, and possibly [involving] extra cost in admin staff"". She would definitely be interested in applying for grants to ease the load. At the moment, in order to import any item from outside the EU, importers need to locate the specific commodity code relating to each specific product. In a no-deal scenario, this would mean British businesses would need to be able to locate commodity codes from HMRC's database, which would be time-consuming. ""Having access to funding and not having to devise it from scratch, that's brilliant. At least it would be something to start off with,"" said Ms Raja. ""There are possibly lots of costs involved that we haven't planned for. ""What will have a huge impact on cost will be whether you do all this yourself or whether you get an agent - but an agent will cost a lot."" Deal or no deal?

"Justice Secretary David Gauke has said he would be ""very surprised"" if the prime minister was prepared to back a no-deal Brexit, if her deal fails. Mr Gauke also said he would find it ""very difficult"" to stay in cabinet, if that became government policy. Cabinet splits have emerged over what should happen if the PM's withdrawal deal is rejected by MPs next month. Andrea Leadsom has suggested a ""managed no deal"" Brexit while Amber Rudd said a new referendum was ""plausible"". Mr Gauke supported Remain in the 2016 referendum. Ministers suggest rival Brexit 'Plan Bs' EU reveals no-deal plans Brexit vote: What could happen next? Labour MP Chuka Umunna, who campaigns for another EU referendum, said the justice secretary had ""effectively admitted that all the talk of leaving the EU without a deal is nonsense and a false threat designed to scare MPs into voting for the government's Brexit plan"". He added: ""At a time when our schools, hospitals and police are desperately underfunded, the Â£4.2bn being spent preparing for Brexit would be far better spent on our public services."" The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March 2019 but an agreement on the terms of its withdrawal and a declaration on future relations will only come into force if the UK and EU Parliaments approve it. The Commons vote was due to be held earlier this month but Theresa May postponed it, once it became clear it would be defeated by a large margin. MPs are due to start debating the deal again on Wednesday 9 January. If Mrs May's deal is rejected, the default position is for the UK to leave in March unless the government seeks to extend the Article 50 negotiating process or Parliament intervenes to stop it happening. Mr Gauke, who was interviewed on theBBC's Political Thinking with Nick Robinson podcast, was asked about comments he reportedly made at a cabinet meeting on Tuesday, in which he dismissed the idea of a ""managed no deal"" Brexit as a ""unicorn"". Mrs May is seeking assurances from EU leaders to address MPs' concerns about the deal He told the BBC: ""I think making a conscious decision to proceed with no deal would not be the responsible course of action and I think we would have to look at what other choices were available to us."" Asked if he would remain in the cabinet, he said: ""I think it would be very difficult for me in those circumstances."" He said there was a risk of an ""accidental no deal"" and that ""the best way of stopping no deal is to back the prime minister's deal, in my view"". May calls off MPs' vote on Brexit deal 'Horrified' firms urge action on Brexit But Mr Gauke said: ""I think if it came down to the government saying, consciously, we will just have to do that, I don't think there would be a lot of support for it. I would be very surprised if the prime minister would be prepared to go down that route."" Mrs May has suggested the choice facing MPs is one between her deal, no deal or potentially, no Brexit at all. She has refused to rule out a ""no deal"" Brexit - under pressure from many MPs to do so. On Thursday, Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom told the BBC a ""managed"" no deal did not have to mean no withdrawal agreement at all. The Leave campaigner said it could be a stripped-down agreement incorporating some of the EU's no-deal preparations. ""What I am looking at is trying to find an alternative so that in the event that we cannot agree to this deal there could be a further deal that looks at a more minimalist approach but enables us to leave with some kind of implementation period. ""That avoids a cliff edge, that avoids uncertainty for businesses and travellers and so on."" What happens now that a deal's been done?

"Alex says he was targeted for being trans Alex Jones has a pair of headphones that completely covers his ears. ""If I'm ever out and about I usually wear them,"" he says. ""So I don't hear anything transphobic."" Alex came out to his friends and family as trans in 2013 aged 15. He describes it as an ""empowering"" move - but claims that he was bullied more at school as a result. He says that he started receiving a steady trickle of slurs like ""tranny"" from anonymous accounts on social media. Sorry, your browser cannot display this map If the map does not load clickhere,external He claims that one person started being openly hostile, insulting him to his face and sending him abusive messages. ""You're a tranny,"" one of the messages allegedly read. ""Nobody will accept you,"" he claims another said. Alex did his best to avoid her. Then one day, in Cwmbran town centre, the situation turned violent, he claims. ""I was hugging another friend,"" says Alex, now 21. ""And as I turned around she was just stood there. And that's when she hit me."" Alex called the police. He says that he went to the station to give a statement, asking them to record it as a transgender hate crime. ""There were several witnesses. [But] the police just dropped the case. They never explained why. ""It made me not trust them,"" he adds. Gwent police confirmed that they initially logged a crime report for a violent transgender hate crime - but that the caller ""later confirmed that they did not believe they had been targeted because of their gender identity"". Alex disputes this claim. ""The incident was fully investigated but without independent evidence to support the case, the decision was made that it would not be possible to proceed,"" a spokesperson for Gwent police said. Alex's case highlights wider uncertainties around the way police treat hate crime, which has risen significantly over the last four years - in part thanks to major improvements in reporting and recording. Some police forces say that they are still ""vastly underreported"" across the UK, however. BBC Three and the BBC's data team analysed four years of data on homophobic and transgender hate crimes provided by 38 police forces. According to the data, 20-29 year-olds are the age group most likely to report being victims of homophobic or transgender hate crime. The data show that people in their 20s are accused of homophobic hate crimes more often than any other age group. Suspects in transgender hate crimes tend to be teenagers or even younger, according to the numbers. The figures show that 70 children aged under-13 - including some younger than seven - have been reported to police for homophobic or transgender hate crimes since 2014. Changes to the way police record crimes have contributed to a two-thirds rise in records of homophobic hate crime and a rise in transgender hate crime of one and half times over the last four years. But the increase hasn't been mirrored by an improvement in the number of crimes solved. Just one in eight (13%) recorded homophobic hate crimes resulted in a charge in 2017 - down from almost one in four (23%) in 2014. An overwhelming majority of the cases in the records for 2017 were closed without resolution. This was usually because of a lack of evidence or a failure to identify a suspect, according to the data. Dr Stevie-Jade Hardy, an Associate Professor in Hate Studies at the University of Leicester, said the rise in all kinds of hate crime over the last four years is probably down to police improvements in recording and better reporting by the public. She cautioned that under-reporting is still significant, however - and ""especially acute"" when it comes to homophobic and transphobic hate crime. ""Our research suggests that there's layers of resistance to reporting including the normalisation of experiences, the perception that reports will not be taken seriously, and fear of being 'outed',"" she said. It's possible that changes to society have also contributed to the rise in hate crimes, she added. This year the government launched a consultation on theGender Recognition Actfollowing calls to make it easier for individuals to change their legal gender. The event was one of a number that revealed ""pervasive hostility"" towards the trans population, according to Dr Hardy. A decade after gay teen Michael Causer's murder, is hate crime rising? Hostility to men and elderly people could become hate crimes Police must tackle hate crime problems, watchdog says The data is from Freedom of Information responses received from 38 police forces across England, Scotland and Wales. They show that Merseyside has the highest rate of recorded homophobic hate crimes, followed by West Yorkshire, South Wales and Leicestershire. The areas with the highest recorded rates of hate crimes are not necessarily the most hostile environments for LGBTQ+ individuals. According to Dr Hardy, some forces are better at recording hate crimes than others. Specialist training for frontline officers, and campaigning to improve reporting, can also have an impact. ""Additionally, the drivers behind acts of homophobic and transphobic hate crime may differ from rural environments to urban areas,"" she says. Policeman at Brighton Pride event Michael Robinson, a 28-year-old care home worker from Merseyside, was the victim of a homophobic hate crime at work in 2015 - when a colleague verbally abused him. ""She confronted me in the middle of the lounge where residents, staff and family were present,"" he said. Michael's colleague shouted a string of homophobic slurs and threatened to beat him up. He went to the police who recorded it as a hate crime and opened an investigation. It led to the dismissal of his colleague. Michael declined to take the criminal case further. Merseyside police said that hate crimes are ""vastly underreported"" across the UK, and that it has taken steps to improve this state of affairs - such as training hate crime officers in new skills to treat victims appropriately. ""We're proud that we have developed a really positive relationship with the LGBTQ+ community and partners, and believe that this supports the higher level of hate crime reports received by the Force,"" said Assistant Chief Constable Julie Cooke. Ben Hodge is an 18-year-old transgender activist from Liverpool. He says that although he has experienced intimidation and abuse, he has never reported it to the police. ""It happens on the bus quite a bit,"" he says. ""In Liverpool you get a lot of young lads - and by young I mean primary school age - hanging out."" He recalls an incident on the bus when he was confronted by some children who he says were ""11 or 12"" years old. ""They walked up to my face and said, 'Are you a boy or a girl? I think we deserve to know.' ""They were five or six years younger than me. But if three of them teamed up they could still do some damage."" Ben didn't report this to the police because he says they ""didn't really do anything to me"". He says he often experiences incidents that are uncomfortable but he does not consider serious enough to warrant a report. Liverpool police station can also feel ""intimidating"", he adds. Despite this, Ben says that Liverpool - which hosts events including a free Pride festival, and a Transgender Day of Remembrance Vigil - is an LGBTQ+ friendly city. ""The minority of people who commit these crimes are ruining it for the majority,"" he says. Any existing criminal offence can be a hate crime if it is considered to be motivated by prejudice. In total more than 90,000 hate crimes of all kinds - including race, religion and disability - wererecorded by police,externalin the year ending March 2018. The rise in offences has been driven largely by a sharp increase in Public Order offences - a category of offence that relates to behaviour in public, including threats, harassment and verbal abuse. While some regional police are working to improve hate crime reporting, some of the country's most senior police officers have criticised a proposal by Home Secretary Sajid Javid to widen the definition of hate crime to include categories such asmisogyny, ageism and misandryquestioning the value of pursuing such crimes if it is at the expense of others. Overstretched police now have less time to focus on ""genuine crimes"" such as burglary and violence, according to Sergeant Richard Cooke, chairman of the West Midlands Police Federation. Police chiefs say that funding in England and Wales has decreased in real terms by nearly a fifth, and there are 20,000 fewer officers. This video can not be played Why do young people love to hate? For people like Alex - who says his trust in the police has been affected - it is vital that potential hate crimes are taken seriously. ""I wouldn't want what happened to me to happen to anybody else,"" he says. ""Other transgender people should know that you can't say or do stuff that victimises other people [just] because they're different. ""The number of hate crimes has gone up, and that means the police have to do something about it."" Gwent police said they have a team of ""over 30"" specialist Hate Crime Support Officers. Detective Chief Superintendent Mark Warrender, Gwent Police's lead for hate crime, who also chairs the Hate Crime and Criminal Justice Board Cymru, said: ""The increase we have seen in recorded anti-LGBT hate crime in Gwent is due to a number of factors, including regular training for officers, increased hate crime awareness within communities, and improved confidence in reporting.""

The Commons vote was due to be held earlier this month but Theresa May postponed it, once it became clear it would be defeated by a large margin. MPs are due to start debating the deal again on Wednesday 9 January. If Mrs May's deal is rejected, the default position is for the UK to leave in March unless the government seeks to extend the Article 50 negotiating process or Parliament intervenes to stop it happening. Mr Gauke, who was interviewed on theBBC's Political Thinking with Nick Robinson podcast, was asked about comments he reportedly made at a cabinet meeting on Tuesday, in which he dismissed the idea of a ""managed no deal"" Brexit as a ""unicorn"". Mrs May is seeking assurances from EU leaders to address MPs' concerns about the deal He told the BBC: ""I think making a conscious decision to proceed with no deal would not be the responsible course of action and I think we would have to look at what other choices were available to us."" Asked if he would remain in the cabinet, he said: ""I think it would be very difficult for me in those circumstances."" He said there was a risk of an ""accidental no deal"" and that ""the best way of stopping no deal is to back the prime minister's deal, in my view"". May calls off MPs' vote on Brexit deal 'Horrified' firms urge action on Brexit But Mr Gauke said: ""I think if it came down to the government saying, consciously, we will just have to do that, I don't think there would be a lot of support for it. I would be very surprised if the prime minister would be prepared to go down that route."" Mrs May has suggested the choice facing MPs is one between her deal, no deal or potentially, no Brexit at all. She has refused to rule out a ""no deal"" Brexit - under pressure from many MPs to do so. On Thursday, Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom told the BBC a ""managed"" no deal did not have to mean no withdrawal agreement at all. The Leave campaigner said it could be a stripped-down agreement incorporating some of the EU's no-deal preparations. ""What I am looking at is trying to find an alternative so that in the event that we cannot agree to this deal there could be a further deal that looks at a more minimalist approach but enables us to leave with some kind of implementation period. ""That avoids a cliff edge, that avoids uncertainty for businesses and travellers and so on."" What happens now that a deal's been done?

"""Gravy day"" has its origins in a 1996 song by Australian musician Paul Kelly It's not exactly a national holiday - yet - but ""gravy day"" is being well celebrated in Australia, thanks to a song and plenty of internet jokes. What is gravy day? It began with a 1996 song called How To Make Gravy by popular Australian singer Paul Kelly. Its lyrics tell a fictional tale of a man in jail writing to his family about longing to be with them at Christmas. That letter is penned on 21 December - a date that, in real life, has been deemed increasingly worth celebrating. And many Australians did on Friday, especially on social media.

""GravyDay"", ""Paul Kelly"" and ""the 21st of December"" were trending terms on Twitter, with many posts playing off How To Make Gravy's narrative. Joe, the song's made-up protagonist, sings about his family's traditions, such as relatives ""driving down from Queensland"" and ""flying in from the coast"". The song has even been likened to ""an Australian Christmas carol"". Instead of northern-hemisphere references to cold things, Joe anticipates a hot Christmas Day. ""They say it's gonna be a hundred degrees, even more maybe,"" the lyrics read, ""but that won't stop the roast"". His emotional messages to family - such as ""give my love to Angus and Frank and Dolly"" - have become a particular focus of fun. Allow Twitter content?

"Carlos Ghosn will for now remain in detention Former Nissan chairman Carlos Ghosn has been re-arrested on fresh charges, Japanese media report, dashing any hopes he could be released on bail. Mr Ghosn has spent the last month in prison, accused of misusing funds and hiding more than $40m (Â£31m) of income. But on Thursday a court rejected a request by the prosecution to extend his detention, which meant he could apply to be released on bail. Friday's arrest is on a new charge of aggravated breach of trust. According to Japanese broadcaster NHK, prosecutors now accuse Mr Ghosn of shifting a private investment loss of over $16m onto Nissan in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. A towering and revered figure in the auto industry, Mr Ghosn has not yet responded to the latest allegation - but he has consistently denied all prior accusations made against him. He was first arrested in Tokyo in November as allegations of financial misconduct surfaced. The BBC's Mariko Oi says that ever since Carlos Ghosn stepped off his private jet only to be taken into police custody, the case has gripped Japan with speculation rife over what could be behind such a stunning fall from grace. The case has been highly unusual - not least for a high profile chief executive to be spending time in jail - but also because of its legal twists such as yesterday's when the court rejected an application to extend his detention, our reporter adds. Carlos Ghosn: The driven 'cost killer' Five charts on the Carlos Ghosn scandal Mr Ghosn was a towering figure in the auto industry If found guilty of the financial misconduct charges he could face up to 10 years in prison as well as a fine of up to 700m Japanese yen ($6.2m; Â£4.9m), according to Japanese regulators. This latest move means he will remain in prison so prosecutors can question him further. Mr Ghosn's detention has also put into doubt the future of the Alliance - a global car manufacturing group that includes Renault, Nissan and Mitsubishi. Nissan and Mitsubishi both sacked Mr Ghosn as chairman after his arrest last month. But Renault has held off, choosing instead to appoint a temporary deputy chief executive to take over the running of the firm. His hero status was so big that his life was serialised in one of Japan's famous cartoon comic books The Brazilian-born boss of Lebanese descent and a French citizen says his background left him with a feeling of being different, which helped him adapt to new cultures In France he was known as Le Cost Killer, a comment on the deep cuts he made to revive Renault He was once tipped as a potential president of Lebanon, a move he eventually dismissed because he already had ""too many jobs"" In a 2011 poll of people the Japanese would like to run their country Mr Ghosn came seventh, in front of Barack Obama (ninth) Court paves way for Ghosn release on bail Four charts on the Carlos Ghosn scandal Carlos Ghosn: The driven 'cost killer' New wildfire sweeps through Hollywood Hills and threatens landmarks as chaos grips LA Watch: Fires reach Hollywood with fears iconic sign could be at risk 'Mum waited 31 hours' : Your stories of A&E 'Where do I go?': Fear and anxiety as people flee Hollywood fire Sound Of 2025: Ezra Collective are 'keeping music real' The Papers: 'Apocalypse' LA and 'Reeves faces extra tax rises' How Australia's beach cabana drama sparked a turf war H-1B: Visa row under Trump fuels anxiety for Indian dreamers 'I thought I was going to die': Jailed Venezuelan activist details brutality of prison life The man who could become Canada's future PM 'Trump 2.0' looms large over the global economy Politics Essential: Get the latest news and analysis delivered to your inbox every weekday Delivering brand-new miracles in 1970s East End Watch the latest series of Call the Midwife on iPlayer now Mark-Anthony Turnage shares the soundtrack of his life Once called 'Britainâs hippest composer', he's tackled topics from drug abuse to football in his work Paddyâs loaf-changing experience inside the bread factory Paddy McGuinness visits the bread factory he used to work in, and sees how they make 1.4 million loaves a week What's behind the global surrogacy boom?

"Users whose IP addresses connected to Slack in countries like Cuba are reportedly affected Some users of communication service Slack have reported their accounts have been closed over visits to countries under US sanctions. The move, which Slack says is to comply with US regulations, is believed to be affecting users who have visited nations including Iran and North Korea. But many on social media say they were not warned in advance. Some have said they had not visited the countries in recent years, and believe their bans were in error. Cuba, Syria and Crimea are other countries and regions where Slack says its systems may not be used. Slack said it would individually review cases if users thought their account had been wrongly targeted. The business messaging service is used by about eight million people every day in thousands of companies, including large firms like Airbnb and Ticketmaster. One user, on website Hacker News, complained that his wife's sudden ban meant she had now lost access to years of work,externaldata including messages and files. Slack allows colleagues to easily communicate as a group He said she had been flagged for travelling, ""legally"" to Cuba ""years ago"" and seemed unable to appeal against the sudden closure.

"The alert began at Stuttgart airport in south-west Germany Germany's biggest airports are on alert after four suspected terrorists were spotted staking out Stuttgart airport, reports say. Police are said to be hunting for a son and father from North Rhine-Westphalia and two others seen taking photos of the airport's terminal and grounds. Details of the suspects were passed to German police by Morocco's secret service, reports say. This comes a week after a terror attack across the border in France. Three people werekilled by Cherif Chekatt near a Christmas Market in Strasbourg, which is some 150km (93 miles) from Stuttgart. Police told public broadcaster ARD that security forces were on alert at German airports, while Bild website said warnings had been extended to all 14 major hubs. Since the Strasbourg attack, suspicious activity had been spotted at both Stuttgart Airport and at Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris, public broadcaster SWR reported. The father and son were captured on surveillance cameras taking photos around the airport, but had disappeared by the time police arrived. The Stuttgart airport suspects' names as well as details of their communications were reportedly given to police by intelligence officials in Morocco. German police would not confirm the reports, with spokesman Roman Strohmayer saying only ""we have information that for the moment cannot yet be judged conclusively."" But, he told Bild website: ""We have detected spying attempts at Stuttgart Airport and have massively tightened our security measures at the airport in cooperation with the state police.

"The US justice department has indicted two Chinese men accused of hacking into the computer networks of companies and government agencies in Western countries. The pair are allegedly part of a ""hacking group"" known as Advanced Persistent Threat 10,external, affiliated with China's main intelligence service. They have not been arrested. The US and UK have accused China of violating an agreement relating to commercial espionage. Zhu Hua and Zhang Shilong worked for a company called Huaying Haitai and in association with the Chinese Ministry of State Security, the US court filing says. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) said that from at least 2006 until 2018, the two extensively hacked into computer systems with the aim of stealing intellectual property and confidential business and technological information from: at least 45 commercial and defence technology companies in at least 12 US states managed service providers (MSPs) and their government and commercial clients in at least 12 countries, including the UK, Brazil, Canada, Finland, France, Germany, India, Japan, Sweden, Switzerland, and the UAE, as well as the US US government agencies The FBI said they had also hacked into US Navy computer systems and stolen the personal information of more than 100,000 personnel. FBI director Christopher Wray said the two men were at present ""beyond US jurisdiction"". Announcing the unsealing of the indictments, US Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein said China had violated a 2015 agreement under which it had pledged to not engage in commercial cyber-spying. US Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein: ""We want China to cease its illegal cyber activities"" Mr Rosenstein said his department's move had been co-ordinated with US allies in Europe and Asia to rebuff ""China's economic aggression"". He added: ""We want China to cease its illegal cyber activities."" The UK government said it was joining allies in holding the Chinese government responsible for a global campaign targeting commercial secrets. UK Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said: ""This campaign is one of the most significant and widespread cyber intrusions against the UK and allies uncovered to date, targeting trade secrets and economies around the world. ""These activities must stop. They go against the commitments made to the UK in 2015, and, as part of the G20, not to conduct or support cyber-enabled theft of intellectual property or trade secrets."" Australia and New Zealand said they too held China responsible for the global hacking campaign and joined their ""like-minded partners"" in condemning the activity. By Gordon Corera, security correspondent This is the latest salvo in Washington's attempt to pressure Beijing on a range of issues, with economic espionage one of the most high-profile. US and UK officials are reluctant to name the companies that have been hit but they say the economic damage has been significant. The hackers, officials say, work under the direction of China's Ministry of State Security - one of the country's intelligence organisations. ""It is organised more like a corporation than a gang,"" one UK official says, adding that British intelligence has the highest level of confidence in their assessment of who was responsible. The UK and US believe China is breaking a 2015 agreement not to steal commercial data to help its companies. There was a dip in activity after the deal was signed (which followed a period of pressure by Washington, including the indictment of Chinese military hackers and the threat of sanctions). But US and UK sources both say that recently they have seen Chinese hackers return, now operating more stealthily, whereas in the past they were easier to spot. Where the US has been vocal in recent months, this is the first time the UK has spoken out - perhaps because it has been concerned about risking trade ties and getting pulled into the Trump administration's broader confrontation with Beijing. UK officials say they have raised the matter privately a number of times with Beijing over the last two years, including during the prime minister's visit earlier this year, and officials are keen to stress that they think the relationship with China is strong enough to allow them to address these issues without causing wider problems.

"This video can not be played Passengers were warned disruption would continue into Friday Shooting down a drone which has caused chaos at Gatwick Airport is a ""tactical option"" being considered by police. The measure had previously been ruled out by Sussex Police, which cited concerns over ""stray bullets"". But with the airport expected to remain closed on Friday, Det Ch Supt Jason Tingley said the force would ""do what we can to take that drone out of the sky"". The Army has been deployed to assist the police operation. Gatwick's chief operating officer Chris Woodroofe said 120,000 passengers had been due to fly out since the airport closed its runway on Wednesday. ""We will review overnight whether there is any potential to open tomorrow,"" he said. ""But we are working up contingency plans all the way through to no flights tomorrow."" Speaking at 21:30 GMT, he said the situation remained ""fluid"", as the drone had been spotted again less than an hour earlier. Police have been locked in a game of cat and mouse with the drone, and have received about 50 reports of the device being flown near the airfield since Wednesday evening, No arrests have been made, and the airport is expected to be closed for the ""foreseeable future"" while the hunt for the operator continues. Those due to travel on Friday have been urged to check with their airline before arriving at the airport. Passengers say many people have been forced to sleep on the floor overnight at the airport Det Ch Supt Tingley said police did not know the make and model of the drone, but suspected it had been ""adapted and developed"" with the intent to cause disruption. Officers had, however, deduced ""certain specifications"" such as the device's size, he said, and urged anyone with pictures of the drone to contact police. Gatwick disruption: As it happened After other strategies to bring down the drone failed, Det Ch Supt Tingley said, the force was reconsidering plans to shoot it down. He said police were also following lines of inquiry, including ""particular groups"" and a ""number of persons of interest"". Armed police were seen at the airfield Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson confirmed the military deployment on Thursday evening. He said the armed forces had a ""range of unique capabilities"" and would ""do everything we can so that they are in a position to open the airport at the earliest opportunity"". Men in military uniform were seen arriving at the airport at about 20:00 GMT and liaising with police officers, before entering the grounds in convoy. How countries counter the drone threat How can a drone cause so much chaos? Gatwick Airport disruption: Your rights Transport Secretary Chris Grayling said: ""We'll do everything we can to ensure that if Gatwick is not open again quickly that we can get [passengers] away from other airports."" He could not confirm whether the perpetrators were close to being caught but added: ""There's a huge amount of effort going on - we've got up-to-date technology, we've brought special technology into Gatwick to try and track this down."" The shutdown started just after 21:00 on Wednesday when two drones were spotted flying ""over the perimeter fence and into where the runway operates from"". The runway briefly reopened at 03:01 on Thursday but was closed again about 45 minutes later due to ""a further sighting of drones"". Drones continued to be spotted throughout the day. More than 20 police units from two forces are searching for the perpetrator, who could face up to five years in jail. Supt Justin Burtenshaw, head of armed policing for Sussex and Surrey, described attempts to catch whoever was controlling the drones as ""painstaking"" because it was ""a difficult and challenging thing to locate them"". ""Each time we believe we get close to the operator, the drone disappears; when we look to reopen the airfield, the drone reappears,"" he said. As a result of an appeal for information, Sussex Police said it had been inundated with calls, but urged people to contact with information ""focussed on the identity or location of the drone operator"". A total of 633 flights have been cancelled About 10,000 passengers were affected overnight on Wednesday and Gatwick said 110,000 people were due to either take off or land at the airport on Thursday. Incoming planes were diverted to other airports including London Heathrow, Luton, Birmingham, Manchester,Cardiff, Glasgow, Paris and Amsterdam. Crowds of travellers spent the morning waiting inside Gatwick's terminal for updates, while others reported being stuck on grounded planes for hours.

Endangering the safety of an aircraft is a criminal offence which can carry a prison sentence of five years. The number of aircraft incidents involving drones has grown dramatically in the past few years, as the popularity of the devices has increased. In 2013 there were zero incidents, compared to almost 100 last year. Mr Grayling said the events at Gatwick are ""not something that's not been experienced in this country before"", even though drones have been a problem elsewhere in the world. The government was now looking to ""go further"" with drone-control, he said, including considering age-limits for users. He added: ""Anyone who tries to do the same [as at Gatwick] again, should expect to go to jail for a long time."" The UK Airprox Board assesses incidents involving drones and keeps a log of all reports. In one incident last year, for example, a pilot flying over Manchester saw a red ""football-sized"" drone passing down the left hand side of the aircraft. In another, a plane leaving Glasgow narrowly missed a drone. The pilot in that case said the crew only had three seconds of warning and there was ""no time to take avoiding action"".

"This video can not be played Is this the drone which caused chaos at Gatwick? Gatwick's runway has reopened after drones caused the airport to shut down for more than a day. The airport, the UK's second busiest, said 837 flights were scheduled but there were delays and cancellations. Boss Chris Woodroofe said ""mitigating measures"" from the government and military had given him ""confidence to reopen"". The drone operator is still at large and police said it was possible they were an environmental activist. The airport is expected to be ""back to normal"" by the end of Saturday. Gatwick Airport - live updates Thousands of passengers - including some attending funerals, honeymoons and Christmas reunions with their families -remain strandedat Gatwick. The airport could not operate while the drones were in flight in case they hit and damaged a plane. The first flights were Norwegian Air, Easyjet and BA departures and a China Eastern Airlines arrival Gatwick said the 837 flights planned for Friday would have more than 130,000 passengers on board. A total of 155 flights have been cancelled. Pilots' union Balpa said it understood detection and tracking equipment had been installed around Gatwick's perimeter and that if the drones reappear the airport would close again. Mr Woodroofe said: ""Additional mitigating measures provided by government agencies and military have given me the confidence to reopen the airport. ""We are now operating at almost normal runway conditions but the challenge for the airlines, as the result of this disruption, is that their planes are not all in the right place. ""So what we'll be doing today is recovering their operations so by tomorrow we are back to standard operation and continue to recover the situation for our passengers."" He added he was determined to get passengers moving so ""they can enjoy their Christmas"". The first flights in and out of Gatwick were Norwegian Air, Easyjet and BA departures and a China Eastern Airlines arrival from Shanghai. Staff continue to advise passengers tocheck their flight status before turning up at the airport,external. Ryanair said it was switching all of its Gatwick flights to operate in and out of Stansted airport on Friday. Extra ""mitigating measures"" from the government, police and military have allowed Gatwick to reopen Sussex Police was locked in a game of cat and mouse with the drone operator. Officers have so far failed to locate the ""industrial specification"" drones or their pilot and had been considering plans to shoot a device down. But Steve Barry, Sussex assistant chief constable, said they were in a ""much better position today"". Mr Barry said a drone had last been seen at 22:00 GMT on Thursday. He added measures to tackle the threat include ""technical, sophisticated options to detect and mitigate drone incursions, all the way down to less sophisticated options""  including using shotguns. Mr Barry previously told BBC Breakfast there were a ""number of lines of inquiry"" into the ""very malicious and criminal behaviour"", including the possibility it could have been the work of an environmental activist. At a press conference, he said there was ""no evidence"" the use of the drones was state-sponsored.

Gatwick Airport disruption: Your rights This video can not be played The first plane to leave Gatwick since Wednesday was bound for Lapland Transport Secretary Chris Grayling said there was no evidence it was terror-related. But he called it a type of disruption ""we've not seen before"" and ""lessons need to be learned"". He said the situation was ""unprecedented, anywhere in the world"". ""Every possible measure will be put in place to make sure this can't happen again,"" he said. But he added there was ""no simple solution"" and ""you can't fire weapons haphazardly around an airport"". It is illegal to fly a drone within 1km of an airport or airfield boundary and flying above 400ft (120m) - which increases the risk of a collision with a manned aircraft - is also banned. Endangering the safety of an aircraft is a criminal offence which can carry a prison sentence of five years. Smiles returned to some passengers' faces today as they were finally able to get away At Gatwick Airport's South Terminal this morning, passengers waited anxiously for news on whether their flights would depart. It appears to be much quieter here today, compared to the chaotic scenes yesterday. As the West Sussex airport announced the reopening of its runway on Friday, some travellers were hopeful of getting airborne. But others expressed concern that the operators of the drone had not yet been apprehended - and could go on to cause more havoc. All weary travellers could do was monitor the arrival and departure boards - showing many cancellations and delays to flights - and hope their Christmas getaways would not be ruined. Passengers have faced long waits inside the airport's terminal Travellers have found themselves unable to fly in and out of Gatwick. Thousands were left stranded for hours inside the airport's terminal building, resorting to sleeping on floors and benches. Some who spoke to the BBC includeda couple hoping to honeymoon in New Yorkand a seven-year-old who had been due to fly to Lapland. Others have found themselves stuck abroad. Airport chief Mr Woodroofe refused to comment on the possibility of those affected by the chaos being awarded compensation. The Civil Aviation Authority said it considered the event to be an ""extraordinary circumstance"", and therefore airlines were not obligated to pay any financial compensation to passengers. But that does not mean passengers should be left out of pocket. It is the airline's responsibility to get anyone with a ticket to their destination, unless the passenger accepts a refund instead.

"British Gas owner Centrica is to mount a legal challenge against Britain's upcoming energy price cap, arguing it has not been calculated fairly. The energy provider said it would apply for a judicial review against the regulator Ofgem, saying it had set the threshold too low. The firm said it wanted not to delay the cap, due to come in on 1 January, but to change how it is set. The regulator said it would defend its proposals ""robustly"". Ofgem proposed a cap on energy bills in September, following concerns that consumers were not getting best value for money from suppliers' default rates, or standard variable tariffs (SVT) . British Gas to take Â£70m hit from price cap Energy bills to be capped in new year It means an average dual fuel customer who pays by direct debit should pay no more than Â£1,137 a year, Â£68 lower than British Gas's SVT. However, the policy has rattled some suppliers who say it will damage their profits and it has alsobeen blamed for some smaller providers going bust. In November Centrica warned the cap would cost it Â£70m in lost operating profits in the first quarter of 2019. This was after British Gas shed 372,000 household accounts in the four months to the end of October as customers left its SVT. Centrica says that Ofgem had not properly taken into account the wholesale energy costs that ""all suppliers incur"" when it devised the cap. Explaining its decision to seek a judicial review, it said: ""Through this action Centrica has no intention to delay implementation of the cap, and does not expect the cap to be deferred in any way. ""As we have previously said, we do not believe that a price cap will benefit customers but we want to ensure that there is a transparent and rigorous regulatory process to deliver a price cap that allows suppliers, as a minimum, to continue to operate to meet the requirements of all customers."" Ofgem told the BBC that it ""carried out an extensive consultation process when setting the price cap and we believe that it offers consumers on poor value tariffs a fairer deal. ""In the event of a judicial review we would defend our proposals robustly."" The regulator says the new energy price cap could save 11 million customers an average of Â£76 a year on their gas and electricity bills. But it has already said that the level of the cap is likely to rise in April 2019, to reflect the higher cost of wholesale energy. As a result, the average annual saving in 2019 is likely to be lower.

"Christina Abbotts died at a friend's flat in Crawley where she had been house-sitting A City banker has been found guilty of murdering a 29-year-old sex worker by bludgeoning her to death with a pestle. Zahid Naseem, 48, admitted killing Christina Abbotts at a flat in Crawley, West Sussex, in May, but denied murder. Naseem stayed in the flat for 12 hours after Ms Abbotts died and pretended to be unconscious when police broke down the door, the court heard. Jurors at Lewes Crown Court heard Ms Abbotts suffered more than 13 wounds to her head and 20 other injuries. Naseem, of Amersham, Buckinghamshire, claimed he was acting in self-defence after Ms Abbotts tried to strangle him during a sex game. He is due to be sentenced on Friday. Zahid Naseem claimed Ms Abbotts held his neck ""and didn't let go"" Police were called to the flat when no-one had heard from Ms Abbotts after midday on 25 May and she failed to turn up to her own birthday party. She is thought to have been dead for about 12 hours before she was found, the court heard. Officers found Naseem lying motionless on the sofa with his eyes flickering, but a paramedic was ""sceptical"" he was unconscious. He only ""woke up"" fully when he was arrested in hospital, claiming to have no idea what happened. When he gave evidence in court, he admitted striking Ms Abbotts but claimed it was in self-defence as he feared she was strangling him to death in a sex game gone wrong. He also said a ""red mist"" may have come over him. Ms Abbotts, who was born in the West Midlands and lived in London, was described as a ""socialite"" who led a party lifestyle in London and told relatives she worked in IT. But she lived a secret life as a high-class escort, who advertised her services online under the pseudonym Tilly Pexton. Naseem paid her up to Â£3,500 a time when they met. In a statement read out after the trial, Ms Abbotts' family said: ""This has had a tremendous impact on our personal and professional lives as we have not been able to meet commitments due to the level of stress and shock we have been experiencing. ""She was beautiful inside and out, and also very kind to others, putting everyone else's needs first.""

"Maren Ueland, left, and Louisa Vesterager Jespersen were found dead in a popular tourist area Four men arrested over the murders of two Scandinavian women in southern Morocco had pledged allegiance to the Islamic State group in a video shared on social media, a prosecutor says. Louisa Vesterager Jespersen, 24, from Denmark, and Maren Ueland, 28, from Norway, were found dead from knife wounds near a popular tourist spot. The Moroccan prosecutor said the video was recorded before the murders. In it the suspects had threatened to carry out attacks, he added. Danish Prime Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen had earlier said the ""unusually bestial"" murders were being investigated as a terrorist attack. Ms Jespersen and Ms Ueland had travelled together to Morocco for a month-long holiday on 9 December, including a trip in the Atlas Mountains. They had been hiking near Imlil, close to North Africa's highest mountain peak Mount Toubkal - an area popular with hikers and climbers. They were found dead inside the tent they shared last Monday. On Tuesday police detained a suspect said to belong to a militant group in Marrakesh. Three other suspects were subsequently arrested in the city, the Central Bureau for Judicial Investigations said. Moroccan police have released photos of three of the suspects Norwegian Prime Minister Erna Solberg has decried the ""brutal and meaningless attack on innocent people"", and said she had trust in the Moroccan authorities to find those responsible. Maren Ueland's mother Irene told public broadcaster NRK that the pair had been studying together at the University of South-Eastern Norway. Both are reported to have been experienced with outdoor activities, and to have prepared well for the hiking trip, which they took without a local guide. By BBC Monitoring Morocco has been largely spared the jihadist violence seen in other countries in North Africa since deadly bombings in Casablanca killed at least 30 people in 2003. The country enacted stiff anti-terrorism legislation to address the threat from its own nationals returning home after fighting for IS in Syria and Iraq - after an estimated 1,600 Moroccans joined jihadist groups there in 2015 Jihadists of Moroccan origin have also been involved in terrorist attacks in recent years in Belgium and France. In terms of jihadist presence in Morocco, both Islamic State and its rival al-Qaeda have failed to establish themselves in the country. But this does not rule out the possibility of attacks by sympathisers or operatives who believe it is their duty to act.

"The chief coroner for England and Wales has called for armed police on all gates of Parliament following the 2017 Westminster terror attack. In his report Mark Lucraft QC said Scotland Yard should order that there is a constant armed presence. The coroner also urged MI5 to improve how it records the reasons why it closes investigations. Solicitors for the families called for all of the recommendations to be swiftly implemented. Khalid Masood killed four people on 22 March last year after hitting them with his car on Westminster Bridge - American tourist Kurt Cochran, retired window cleaner Leslie Rhodes, mother-of-two Aysha Frade and Romanian designer Andreea Cristea. He then ran into Parliament's grounds and stabbed to death unarmed PC Keith Palmer before he himself was shot dead by other officers. Clockwise from top left: PC Keith Palmer, Aysha Frade, Leslie Rhodes, Andreea Cristea and Kurt Cochran Coroners have the power to write reports to the government and other public bodies that make recommendations aimed at averting further similar tragedies. In his report, Mr Lucraft said,external: ""It was a matter of concern that, at the time of the attack, one of the most vulnerable and public entrances to the Parliamentary Estate was not protected by armed police. ""In my view, the Metropolitan Police Service should consider imposing a standing order that there should be armed officers stationed at all open public entry points to the Palace of Westminster and introducing a provision that this standing order may only be varied with the written approval of an officer of very senior rank."" At the conclusion of the inquests, Mr Lucraft ruled that PC Palmer's death could have possibly been prevented if armed police officers had been nearby. And he recommended that officers be trained to deal with ""lone actor or multi-actor marauding attacks"". The issues raised at the Westminster Attack inquests Could Khalid Masood have been stopped? During the inquests, a senior MI5 officer revealed that the security service had once investigated Khalid Masood - but discounted him as a threat many years before he ultimately attacked. Mr Lucraft urged MI5 to begin recording reasons for closing a file on a suspect - so that if a case were to be reopened in the future, investigators would have a full picture of what was known about the individual and why they had been discounted as a threat. Gary Cassidy and Helen Boniface, solicitors for some of the victims, said: ""Swift application of all these recommendations is crucial in demonstrating that the many lessons arising from this attack have been learned."" A spokesman for Scotland Yard said that there had been an immediate review of parliamentary security following the attack - and further work was continuing.

"Alex says he was targeted for being trans Alex Jones has a pair of headphones that completely covers his ears. ""If I'm ever out and about I usually wear them,"" he says. ""So I don't hear anything transphobic."" Alex came out to his friends and family as trans in 2013 aged 15. He describes it as an ""empowering"" move - but claims that he was bullied more at school as a result. He says that he started receiving a steady trickle of slurs like ""tranny"" from anonymous accounts on social media. Sorry, your browser cannot display this map If the map does not load clickhere,external He claims that one person started being openly hostile, insulting him to his face and sending him abusive messages. ""You're a tranny,"" one of the messages allegedly read. ""Nobody will accept you,"" he claims another said. Alex did his best to avoid her. Then one day, in Cwmbran town centre, the situation turned violent, he claims. ""I was hugging another friend,"" says Alex, now 21. ""And as I turned around she was just stood there. And that's when she hit me."" Alex called the police. He says that he went to the station to give a statement, asking them to record it as a transgender hate crime. ""There were several witnesses. [But] the police just dropped the case. They never explained why. ""It made me not trust them,"" he adds. Gwent police confirmed that they initially logged a crime report for a violent transgender hate crime - but that the caller ""later confirmed that they did not believe they had been targeted because of their gender identity"". Alex disputes this claim. ""The incident was fully investigated but without independent evidence to support the case, the decision was made that it would not be possible to proceed,"" a spokesperson for Gwent police said. Alex's case highlights wider uncertainties around the way police treat hate crime, which has risen significantly over the last four years - in part thanks to major improvements in reporting and recording. Some police forces say that they are still ""vastly underreported"" across the UK, however. BBC Three and the BBC's data team analysed four years of data on homophobic and transgender hate crimes provided by 38 police forces. According to the data, 20-29 year-olds are the age group most likely to report being victims of homophobic or transgender hate crime. The data show that people in their 20s are accused of homophobic hate crimes more often than any other age group. Suspects in transgender hate crimes tend to be teenagers or even younger, according to the numbers. The figures show that 70 children aged under-13 - including some younger than seven - have been reported to police for homophobic or transgender hate crimes since 2014. Changes to the way police record crimes have contributed to a two-thirds rise in records of homophobic hate crime and a rise in transgender hate crime of one and half times over the last four years. But the increase hasn't been mirrored by an improvement in the number of crimes solved. Just one in eight (13%) recorded homophobic hate crimes resulted in a charge in 2017 - down from almost one in four (23%) in 2014. An overwhelming majority of the cases in the records for 2017 were closed without resolution. This was usually because of a lack of evidence or a failure to identify a suspect, according to the data. Dr Stevie-Jade Hardy, an Associate Professor in Hate Studies at the University of Leicester, said the rise in all kinds of hate crime over the last four years is probably down to police improvements in recording and better reporting by the public. She cautioned that under-reporting is still significant, however - and ""especially acute"" when it comes to homophobic and transphobic hate crime. ""Our research suggests that there's layers of resistance to reporting including the normalisation of experiences, the perception that reports will not be taken seriously, and fear of being 'outed',"" she said. It's possible that changes to society have also contributed to the rise in hate crimes, she added. This year the government launched a consultation on theGender Recognition Actfollowing calls to make it easier for individuals to change their legal gender. The event was one of a number that revealed ""pervasive hostility"" towards the trans population, according to Dr Hardy. A decade after gay teen Michael Causer's murder, is hate crime rising? Hostility to men and elderly people could become hate crimes Police must tackle hate crime problems, watchdog says The data is from Freedom of Information responses received from 38 police forces across England, Scotland and Wales. They show that Merseyside has the highest rate of recorded homophobic hate crimes, followed by West Yorkshire, South Wales and Leicestershire. The areas with the highest recorded rates of hate crimes are not necessarily the most hostile environments for LGBTQ+ individuals. According to Dr Hardy, some forces are better at recording hate crimes than others. Specialist training for frontline officers, and campaigning to improve reporting, can also have an impact. ""Additionally, the drivers behind acts of homophobic and transphobic hate crime may differ from rural environments to urban areas,"" she says. Policeman at Brighton Pride event Michael Robinson, a 28-year-old care home worker from Merseyside, was the victim of a homophobic hate crime at work in 2015 - when a colleague verbally abused him. ""She confronted me in the middle of the lounge where residents, staff and family were present,"" he said. Michael's colleague shouted a string of homophobic slurs and threatened to beat him up. He went to the police who recorded it as a hate crime and opened an investigation. It led to the dismissal of his colleague. Michael declined to take the criminal case further. Merseyside police said that hate crimes are ""vastly underreported"" across the UK, and that it has taken steps to improve this state of affairs - such as training hate crime officers in new skills to treat victims appropriately. ""We're proud that we have developed a really positive relationship with the LGBTQ+ community and partners, and believe that this supports the higher level of hate crime reports received by the Force,"" said Assistant Chief Constable Julie Cooke. Ben Hodge is an 18-year-old transgender activist from Liverpool. He says that although he has experienced intimidation and abuse, he has never reported it to the police. ""It happens on the bus quite a bit,"" he says. ""In Liverpool you get a lot of young lads - and by young I mean primary school age - hanging out."" He recalls an incident on the bus when he was confronted by some children who he says were ""11 or 12"" years old. ""They walked up to my face and said, 'Are you a boy or a girl? I think we deserve to know.' ""They were five or six years younger than me. But if three of them teamed up they could still do some damage."" Ben didn't report this to the police because he says they ""didn't really do anything to me"". He says he often experiences incidents that are uncomfortable but he does not consider serious enough to warrant a report. Liverpool police station can also feel ""intimidating"", he adds. Despite this, Ben says that Liverpool - which hosts events including a free Pride festival, and a Transgender Day of Remembrance Vigil - is an LGBTQ+ friendly city. ""The minority of people who commit these crimes are ruining it for the majority,"" he says. Any existing criminal offence can be a hate crime if it is considered to be motivated by prejudice. In total more than 90,000 hate crimes of all kinds - including race, religion and disability - wererecorded by police,externalin the year ending March 2018. The rise in offences has been driven largely by a sharp increase in Public Order offences - a category of offence that relates to behaviour in public, including threats, harassment and verbal abuse. While some regional police are working to improve hate crime reporting, some of the country's most senior police officers have criticised a proposal by Home Secretary Sajid Javid to widen the definition of hate crime to include categories such asmisogyny, ageism and misandryquestioning the value of pursuing such crimes if it is at the expense of others. Overstretched police now have less time to focus on ""genuine crimes"" such as burglary and violence, according to Sergeant Richard Cooke, chairman of the West Midlands Police Federation. Police chiefs say that funding in England and Wales has decreased in real terms by nearly a fifth, and there are 20,000 fewer officers. This video can not be played Why do young people love to hate? For people like Alex - who says his trust in the police has been affected - it is vital that potential hate crimes are taken seriously. ""I wouldn't want what happened to me to happen to anybody else,"" he says. ""Other transgender people should know that you can't say or do stuff that victimises other people [just] because they're different. ""The number of hate crimes has gone up, and that means the police have to do something about it."" Gwent police said they have a team of ""over 30"" specialist Hate Crime Support Officers. Detective Chief Superintendent Mark Warrender, Gwent Police's lead for hate crime, who also chairs the Hate Crime and Criminal Justice Board Cymru, said: ""The increase we have seen in recorded anti-LGBT hate crime in Gwent is due to a number of factors, including regular training for officers, increased hate crime awareness within communities, and improved confidence in reporting.""
