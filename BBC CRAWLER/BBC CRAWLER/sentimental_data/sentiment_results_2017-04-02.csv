"This video can not be played Celtic share Scottish title joy with fans Celtic have won a sixth consecutive Scottish Premiership title with eight games to spare after thrashing Hearts 5-0 at Tynecastle on Sunday. Brendan Rodgers' side needed three points against fifth-placed Hearts to be confirmed as champions afterAberdeen hammered Dundeeon Friday. And they did so with a hat-trick from Scott Sinclair and goals from Stuart Armstrong and Patrick Roberts. Unbeaten Celtic have dropped just four points so far during their campaign. ""My job when I came in was to win it in the best way we possibly could,"" said Rodgers. ""We have had many outstanding performances, but we have only just begun because there's still an awful lot of development in this team. That's the real exciting part."" How Celtic's title-clinching win at Tynecastle unfolded Match report: Hearts 0-5 Celtic Celtic's title triumph by numbers How does Celtic's title win compare with other record-breaking runs? Celtic are still on course to win the domestic treble, having beaten Aberdeen in November to win the League Cup, while they face rivals Rangers in the Scottish Cup semi-finals later this month. The last time the club won all three major Scottish domestic trophies in one season was 2000-01 and the feat has only been achieved once since - when Rangers claimed a treble in 2002-03. ""The run we're on is incredible,"" said Rodgers in an interview with Football Focus prior to Sunday's title-clinching victory. ""In terms of the treble, we never really mention it. Obviously the supporters can dream, which is great, but we have to just think about performing and playing well."" Celtic could also became the first team to go a full 38-game Scottish Premiership campaign unbeaten. The last time a Scottish side went a full season unbeaten was Rangers in 1898-99, while Celtic did the same the year before - but the season only lasted 18 games. This video can not be played Rodgers wants to 'give more years' to Celtic Former Liverpool boss Rodgers was appointedin May 2016 to replace Ronny Deila, whoquit at the end of last seasonafter two mixed years in charge. Deila led Celtic to back-to-back titles but failed to deliver success in Europe, losing to Maribor and Malmo in the last round of Champions League qualifying and also finishing last in their Europa League group in 2015-16. Rodgers' first major task was to qualify for the Champions League group stages, only for Celtic to sufferarguably the worst defeat in their historyagainst Gibraltarian part-time side Lincoln Red Imps in the second qualifying round first leg. After winning the second leg to progress, they neededa stoppage-time penalty from Moussa Dembeleto edge past Kazakh side Astana in the third qualifying round beforehanging on away to Hapoel Beer Shevaof Israel to reach the group stages. Once there, they suffered their heaviest European defeat ina 7-0 thrashing by Barcelonabut recovered to secure two draws against Premier League side Manchester City and a draw at German side Borussia Monchengladbach. ""We need a couple of players in order to compete at Champions League level - we had some really good performances but there is certain dynamic, power and technique we need,"" Rodgers told Sky Sports after Sunday's title win. A summer clearout led to forwards Carlton Cole, Anthony Stokes, Colin Kazim-Richards and Stefan Scepovic all departing Celtic Park. Yet the club were not left short of attacking talent after the signings of Dembele from Fulham and Scott Sinclair from Aston Villa. Dembele, 20, has scored 32 goals this season and is now one of Europe's most sought-after talents, while 28-year-old winger Sinclair has struck 21 times in all competitions. Rodgers has also improved the fortunes of players he inherited, most notably 25-year-old central midfielder Stuart Armstrong, who has impressed since becoming a regular starter after October, making his Scotland debut in March. Read more: Tom English on the Rodgers effect at Celtic Former Celtic striker Chris Sutton:""People can knock the Scottish league as much as they like, but at the start of the season, Rangers thought they could push Celtic. ""Brendan has done nothing wrong - unbeaten in the league, relative success in Europe given that the last manager was really poor and they had no right to get in the Champions League. I didn't think they'd get in the Europa League. ""He has worked wonders this season and should get credit for that. ""The pressure for Rodgers was going to come in the early part of the season, because the Celtic fans expected this season and expectation was high. ""He's totally transformed the playing personnel, made good signings and the team is a million times better."" Former Celtic goalkeeper Pat Bonner:""Celtic will buy one or two more players and they can attract quality since they are in the Champions League. ""They did it in style. Their finishing was magnificent against Hearts - once they settled into this game, there was no chance of Hearts winning it. ""The way Celtic have gone about their business from day one has been exceptional. It's been a joy to watch them this season."" Rodgers has been suggested as a possible replacement for Arsene Wengershould the Arsenal boss decide to leave at the end of the season. The Northern Irishman himself has said he wants to ""give more years"" to Celtic and is a supporter of what he calls ""one of the most iconic clubs in the world"". But could Rodgers make a return to the Premier League? Former Liverpool midfielder Dietmar Hamann:""Brendan Rodgers has got more chance and justification to get a big job now then he did at the time when he went to Liverpool. ""To go a whole season unbeaten, which they can still do, to get in the Champions League against all the odds and give Manchester City a game - of course they had a heavy defeat to Barcelona but it's happened to others. ""If you look at that Arsenal job, Rodgers could be one of the first names on the list."" Sunday Times football correspondent Jonathan Northcroft:""Rodgers is still in the rebuilding phase of his career. ""I'm a fan of his in general, but this will be his first league title and he only just won his first trophy in November, so he's quite a long way away from being the man to succeed Arsene Wenger. ""He got quite sensitive towards the end of his time with Liverpool, towards how things were covered - he was banning the press. ""If he wants another big job, he's going to have to handle that properly.""

"Ciara Horne was taken to hospital with severe cuts and bruises on Thursday Welsh cyclist Ciara Horne says she needs psychological help before returning to road training after being knocked off her bike while commuting. Thedouble European champion,externalsaid she fears she suffered a fractured wrist in theincident on Thursdaybut knows she ""escaped serious injury"". The 27-year-old - Team GB's reserve as theywon 2016 Olympic Team Pursuit goldin Rio - said she had lost confidence. ""It's frightening and has made me question my safety,"" she said. The full-time physiotherapist was riding from her home in Cardiff to the Royal Glamorgan Hospital in Llantrisant when the incident happened. Ciara Horne (far right) was part of the GB team that won bronze at the 2016 World Championships She was rushed to hospital in an ambulance with severe cuts and bruises and will have an MRI scan on a suspected fracture of the scaphoid, a bone in the wrist, on Monday. Miss Horne has had ""get well soon"" wishes from British cycling greats Jo Rowsell Shand, Laura Trott and Geraint Thomas since the incident near Pontyclun Fire Station in Rhondda Cynon Taff. ""As the car pulled from a side road straight out in front of me, I couldn't swerve or brake in time so hit it,"" she recalled. ""I bounced off the windscreen. As I crashed to the floor, my head was spinning and couldn't close my jaw. I was pretty hysterical. ""The man in the car behind me stopped and rung my mum. He said it was 'spectacular' and I was 'lucky to be alive' so I'm blessed to still be here."" GB cycling team-mates Jo Rowsell Shand and Ciara Horne are close long-time friends Miss Horne competed at the 2014 Commonwealth Games and is expected to be in the Welsh cycling squad, including Olympic gold medal winner Elinor Barker, that is among the favourites to win the four-rider, 4km team pursuit title at next year's Commonwealths in Australia. But she told the BBC: ""It's frightening and has made me question my safety. ""I have lost a lot of confidence on the road. I know I should get straight back on the road but I will need the help of the brilliant Sport Wales psychologists who I can talk to, to build my belief back up. ""You don't ever think something like this is going to happen to you, it gave me one hell of a fright. ""My fitness is good, but I need to work on the mental side now and have a phased return to the road. ""I have a lot of soft tissue injuries and I know they take time to heal, often longer than broken bones."" Ciara Horne won two bronze medals at the 2016 World Championships Miss Horne has stepped away from British Cycling in Manchester to work full-time, as well as being funded by Welsh Cycling and training in Newport. She will now take inspiration from fellow Welsh rider Becky James, the former double world champion, who recovered from acancer scareand achronic knee conditionto wintwo silver medalsat last year's Rio Olympics. ""Her Olympic silvers were like gold,"" said Miss Horne. ""She came back from numerous injuries and I hope I can do something similar. She's an inspiration.

Paul Arsenal 2-2 Manchester City Arsenal Arsenal forward Danny Welbeck on Sky Sports:""We showed character but we have to look at how we conceded goals today. ""At this point of the season we know it is not good enough. We want to be further up the league and we have dropped two more points. ""Both teams want possession and have lots of attacking players, it was a good game for the neutrals. We wanted three points."" #bbcfootball Dave Payn:'The decision will be soon'. Two weeks ago 'The decision has been made'. I feel Wenger's indecision filters down to the players. Arsenal 2-2 Manchester City Manchester City Manchester City midfielder Fernandinho on Sky Sports:""We showed we came here to win the game. It was a missed opportunity. ""We tried to push on and press high but Arsenal started to play long balls which made it difficult for us.Â ""The Premier League is still open, we have a tough game at Chelsea away and to be close to them we have to win that game."" #bbcfootball Kartik Venkat:How about Wenger's Barca beating Arsenal (again!) in the last 16 of the CL 2 seasons from now? Would love to see that.Â Arsenal 2-2 Manchester City Arsenal Arsenal manager Arsene Wengeron Sky Sports: ""We started very nervously. We had a refusal to lose the game, we were ready for a fight. ""It was a strong performance on the mental front. Technically we can do better.Â ""The test was mental. We had to come back after half-time and we got a point after a time that has been so stressful for us."" #bbcfootball Elixir Gautam:Arsene, announce you are leaving today. Players and fans will unite to support your legacy. If it doesn't we're going downward.Â Manchester City Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola on the penalty appeal late on:Â ""I know this referee because we have had him before but I don't want to discuss the penalty. On facing Chelsea on Wednesday:Â ""We play against a team who is stable in what they do. We don't have too much time to prepare but we go back to Manchester now and recover and then come back to London."" Arsenal 2-2 Manchester City Manchester City Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola:""They were better in the second half, but it's OK, time to improve. ""We didn't play in the first half, after the goal we forgot to play, the desire went. In the second half we played more. We suffered a lot in the first half because we did not make those passes together. Â On playing Jesus Navas at right-back:""I want to congratulate Jesus Navas who was excellent against one of the best players in the world in Alexis Sanchez. ""I played him because Bacary Sagna was injured and Pablo Zabaleta were not ready and Jesus always deserves the best because he is an excellent guy and I was so happy with him."" If Wenger does leave Arsenal, and keeps his promise to remain in management, how strange would it be to see him charge of another club? Would there be any circumstances where he would manageagainstArsenal? It would be like when Queen reformed with Adam Lambert as frontman.  Arsenal 2-2 Manchester City Ian WrightFormer Arsenal striker on 606 I cannot see the Arsene Wenger I know not being in football.Â If he did retire, what would he do and that might be a frightening prospect for him.Â It's like when a player retires - yes, you get to spend more time with the family and do things you have never been allowed to do like go skiing or things like that, but it can be a very scary place because your whole life was football.Â #bbcfootball Weenson Oo:Â Wenger's comment on retirement indicative of one fearing the prospect of retirement. Meantime, Arsenal suffers.Â Arsenal 2-2 Manchester City Arsenal More from Arsene Wenger:""You could see that the players were down after it went to 2-1 but they gave everything to come back. The draw is the least we needed today. Psychologically it was important not to lose. ""Koscielny has an Achilles injury, I don't know how long he will be out for.Â ""We are in a tough battle for the top four. I am professional and I have shown great loyalty in the past. I love this club, I don't know how long I will be here, I am clear in my head, that's the most important thing. The decision will be soon."" Arsenal 2-2 Manchester City Arsenal Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger:""We were nervous and surprised by their start. I feared that we could start with the handbrake on because of the pressure we are under. ""We were not completely at our best because of the pressure but we showed mental strength and did not lie down. Mathematically a draw is not the best solution for both teams but it is a point which will help us."" Â© 2025 BBC.

"Scott Sinclair has scored six goals in three games against Hearts Celtic clinched a sixth consecutive Scottish title with a flourish as three-goal Scott Sinclair again proved to be a thorn in the flesh of Hearts. Brendan Rodgers'side survived early pressure to sweep to victory and secure the earliest title success, with eight games to spare, in a 38-game campaign. Two deadly finishes from Sinclair - he has scored six in three outings against Hearts - edged Celtic ahead. Stuart Armstrong and Patrick Roberts matched them before a Sinclair penalty. The final whistle signalled a party in the Edinburgh sunshine as Celtic celebrated their 48th Scottish title - their 12th this century and first with Rodgers as manager. And the records keep tumbling for Celtic, who remain unbeaten in 37 domestic games this season, eclipsing a 100-year-old club record. A fitting way to win title - Rodgers Celtic's title triumph by numbers Rodgers' revolution drives Celtic on How does Celtic's title win compare to other record-breaking runs? This video can not be played Celtic share Scottish title joy with fans Winning the title in Edinburgh was an act of perfect symmetry for Rodgers' side. The Northern Irishman's first domestic game in charge of Celtic was at Tynecastle and the packed stands were playing host to the 300th league meeting between the sides - and the 150th to be hosted by Hearts. On that day back on 7 August, a late goal from Sinclair was needed to subdue hosts who were looking to overtake Aberdeen as Celtic's main title challengers after finishing third in their first season back in the top flight. A Sinclair double also helped secure a 4-0 win over Hearts in Glasgow in January on a day when he deputised up front due to the absence of first-choice strikers Moussa Dembele and deputy Leigh Griffiths. That day, the 28-year-old's goals came after he was switched to a more natural wide role, with Roberts in the centre, and that's the way they started at Tynecastle this time out as Rodgers was again denied his two top marksmen through injury. Lesson learned, one-time Manchester City winger Sinclair combined superbly with fellow Englishman Roberts, himself on loan from the Etihad Stadium, twice within three first-half minutes to virtually end Hearts' challenge. This video can not be played Hearts a work in progress - Cathro Aberdeen's 7-0 thrashing of Dundee on Friday had ensured that Celtic would require another three points to secure the title. However, there were few signs that Hearts had the form to make them wait any longer. Celtic had arrived at Tynecastle unbeaten in their last 10 visits since their last defeat by Hearts - 2-0 at Tynecastle in October 2011 - with the Edinburgh side only avoiding defeat once during that spell. Since Ian Cathro had taken over as head coach from MK Dons-bound Robbie Neilson, they had slipped from second to fifth and had won only once in their last seven outings. Yet they had lost only two of their last 14 Premiership home games and they came out full of determination to deny Celtic a title party in their own back yard. Cathro looked to have won the early tactical battle, with his high-pressing game knocking the visitors out their stride and Isma Goncalves twice testing goalkeeper Craig Gordon, who then saved at point-blank range from Jamie Walker. Patrick Roberts set up two goals and scored one for Celtic It had looked ominous for Hearts when Sinclair played in Callum McGregor to find the net after only two minutes. The linesman's flag allowed the home side to breathe again and they were soon giving as good as they got in a fast and furious start that raged from end to end. McGregor somehow side-footed wide from only six yards and we began to question Rodgers' decision to switch to an unusual formation with three at the back. However, Sinclair played a clever one-two with Roberts on the edge of the penalty box before thumping high past goalkeeper Jack Hamilton to give Celtic a 24th-minute lead. It was soon two as Roberts threaded the ball behind the Hearts defence for Sinclair to score again. Hearts' defensive frailties had come home to roost and Armstrong's 20-yard drive after the break and Roberts' deft chip from the edge of the penalty area ensured the title was on its way back to Glasgow. Sinclair completed his hat-trick from the penalty spot after being pulled down by Krystian Nowak. What now for Celtic? With the League Cup already won, a Scottish Cup semi-final awaits as they seek a domestic treble and the prospect of ending the domestic season unbeaten - a feat no Scottish champions have achieved since the late 19th century.

"It was one of the worst school shootings in American history, but some people insist that the Sandy Hook massacre never happened. They post YouTube videos and spread rumours online, and their false theories have been repeated by a media mogul conspiracy theorist who has been linked to Donald Trump. Now, after years of harassment, the families of the victims are fighting back online. Leonard Pozner clicks on a YouTube video showing his street and the outside of his home. The camera zooms in on his balcony, and his address and a route to his door flash up on the screen. There's no narration on the video - but there doesn't need to be. The message is clear:""We know where you live."" Because of videos like this one - there are dozens on YouTube, and more appear ever day - Pozner doesn't want to disclose the city where he now lives. He's had death threats and has moved several times in recent years. This video can not be played Lenny Pozner lost his son Noah in the Sandy Hook shootings, and then had to fight trolls who said it never happened Leonard Pozner has been targeted because he's fought back against trolls and conspiracy theorists who make sweeping and false allegations about the murder of his son. ""Noah was just a regular six-year-old child,"" says Leonard, who's also known as Lenny. ""I dropped him off that morning - it really was an ordinary day of getting the kids ready for school. ""Then an hour-and-a-half later it was just the worst nightmare. Worse than any nightmare I could have imagined."" The nightmare began on 14 December 2012 when a young man named Adam Lanza killed his mother and then drove to Sandy Hook Elementary School. In a matter of minutes, he shot dead 20 children and six adults, before taking his own life. Even in a country where mass shootings are common, Sandy Hook stood out. The pupils were so young, and there were so many of them. Hundreds were traumatised - and many still are - after witnessing the carnage and its aftermath. And yet despiteextensive investigations,externaland a report which determined that Lanza acted alone, conspiracy theorists have constructed a fake alternate reality in which the whole thing was an elaborate hoax, staged by the government to try to introduce strict gun control laws. They seize on small inconsistencies between initial news reports from the chaotic scene and the facts. The more extreme among them have targeted the families of Sandy Hook victims. There have been at least two arrests linked to the hoax theories. On Wednesday, a warrant was issued for a Florida woman who isaccused of harassing Lenny Pozner,external. This video can not be played The sister of a Sandy Hook victim tells the BBC she is getting threats from conspiracy theorists ""We're a luckier family,"" says Hannah D'Avino, whose sister Rachel was a behavioural therapist at Sandy Hook Elementary School. ""I personally will get about like three death threats a year because we don't speak up that much."" On a sunny, late winter's day in New England, Hannah sits in the stately Newtown Public Library, down the road from where her sister was murdered. She recalls her sister's spirit, her profound positive influence on her life, and her work with autistic children. Her voice is subdued, but quivers with quiet determination. ""My sister was murdered 11 days before Christmas and I consider myself lucky because I don't have a stalker,"" she tells me. ""That's the situation I'm in right now."" Some of the conspiracy theorists are regular visitors to this small hamlet in suburban Connecticut. In addition to the death threats and harassment directed at Lenny, Hannah and others, they've made videos of the school and local area and ask questions of locals and family members, and have posted the footage on YouTube. And their theories have been picked up by one of America's most popular conspiracy theorists, a man who has been linked with President Donald Trump. The online storm has prompted Lenny to form a volunteer network to track and take down the conspiracy theory videos and websites. And other Sandy Hook residents are pleading with President Trump, asking him to speak out and help stop the madness. You can hear this story onBBC Trending on the BBC World Serviceor onThe Sandy Hook Deniers on BBC Radio 4, Sunday 2 April at 13:30 And for more Trending stories,download our podcast Wolfgang Halbig is one of the chief conspiracy theorists who denies the massacre happened Wolfgang Halbig lives in a big yellow house in a sunny, lavishly landscaped gated community in Florida. He's a retired school administrator and safety advisor, and he says that when he first heard news of the Sandy Hook shootings, he was sitting in a chair in his living room, drinking coffee. ""My hairs stood up,"" he says. ""Because they're not protected in the elementary schools."" Halbig donated money to the Sandy Hook families. But he soon became both obsessed with the tragedy - and, somehow, convinced that it never happened. ""I think 14 Dec 2012 is an event that was in planning for a long, long time,"" he tells me. ""I think it probably took them two, two-and-a-half years to write the scripts for all the participants that were invited to participate in that exercise  - or drill as I will call it."" Halbig has since devoted years of his life to ""exposing"" what he thinks is a government plot. He started a website. He's revealed personal information about the victims of his attacks, including names, addresses, legal documents and financial information. And he's personally travelled to Sandy Hook a number of times. ""I call it an illusion. The biggest government illusion that's ever been pulled off by [the US Department of] Homeland Security."" In his office, ghoulish blown-up pictures of the crime scene mingle with pictures of his family and his days as an American football player. His so-called evidence consists of a string of tiny details, small anomalies which are for the most part easily explained by the inchoate nature of a horrific breaking news event. ""I'll be honest with you,"" he says, ""if I'm wrong, I need to be institutionalised."" This video can not be played  Visit theTrending Facebook page,external Conspiracy theories are a perennial feature of American life. But now they can be picked up by extremists and spread virally through social media. And that process has been fuelled by America's deeply partisan political environment. Hundreds of videos online are pushing false Sandy Hook narratives. Collectively, they have millions of views. Falsehoods are repeated by Twitter accounts and on Facebook. Still, the theories might have stayed quarantined in some of the darker corners of the internet, were they not picked up and amplified by one of America's most popular conspiracy theorists. Alex Jones of Infowars Alex Jones is a talk show host and the founder of the multimedia portal Infowars. Regular listeners and readers are used to his rants on everything from 9/11 to attacks across Europe. And on several broadcasts he embraced the Sandy Hook conspiracy theorists. Less than two years after the attacks, he welcomed Halbig on his programme and talked about an Infowars story headlined ""FBI says no one killed at Sandy Hook,external"". ""Internet sleuths immediately took to the web to stitch together clues indicating the shooting could be a carefully-scripted false flag event, similar to the 9/11 terror attacks, the central tenet being that the event would be used to galvanize future support for gun control legislation,"" the story stated. He returned to the theme several months lateron his radio show,external: ""I've had the investigators on, the state police have gone public, you name it - the whole thing is a giant hoax. And the problem is, how do you deal with a total hoax? How do you even convince the public something's a total hoax?"" Later he said: ""Sandy Hook is a synthetic, completely fake with actors, in my view, manufactured. I couldn't believe it at first. I knew they had actors there clearly but I thought they killed some real kids, and it just shows how bold they are, that they clearly used actors."" The liberal think tank Media Matters for America haslisted other instances,externalof Jones accusing the parents of murdered children being actors or casting doubt on the Sandy Hook investigation. Matt Gertz of Media Matters says that online and on air, Jones has an audience of about 8 million. ""It's kind of remarkable, but believing that Sandy Hook was a hoax is actually fairly small ball for an Alex Jones conspiracy,"" Gertz says. ""He thinks that a set of global elites are planning to murder 80% of the world populace and enslave the rest of them. He has claimed that the federal government has a weather machine that they use to target tornado strikes on unfriendly populaces. ""He is sort of the nexus for what's really a distributed network of conspiracy theorists who are on Facebook or on Twitter or using sites like Reddit or 4Chan or 8Chan."" Jones (left) along with former Trump campaign advisor Roger Stone (centre) and journalist Jonathan Alter at the 2016 Republican National Convention in Cleveland, Ohio Jones, who did not respond to repeated requests for an interview, has also been linked to President Trump. In late 2015, Trump appeared on Jones's radio programme. At the end of ahalf-hour interview,external, the candidate told the host: ""I just want to finish by saying your reputation's amazing. I will not let you down, you will be very very impressed I hope. ""And I think we'll be speaking a lot... a year into office, you'll be saying 'Wow, I remember that interview, he said he was going to do it, and he did a great job.' You'll be very proud of our country."" Former Trump campaign advisor Roger Stone regularly appears on Jones's show, andreportedly was the person who introduced,externalthe presidential candidate and the talk show host. Trump has retweeted Infowars reporters and stories (for examplehere,externalandhere,external) and stories of dubious provenance that first appeared on the site have regularly shown up in Trump speeches and tweets. To take just one example: in November 2016,Trump tweeted,external: ""In addition to winning the Electoral College in a landslide, I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally."" The message repeated an allegation with scant basis in fact - a story thathad appeared on Infowars earlier that month,external. Trump has not endorsed the Sandy Hook conspiracy theory, nor has he spoken about Jones's claims that the massacre was a hoax. The White House did not respond to a number of requests for comment, including a series of questions about the relationship between the president and Jones. Jones himself has tried to make the most of his connections to Trump. He claims the president called him shortly after winning the election and has spoken to him since, although thethe New York Times reported,externalthat a Trump aide, speaking on condition of anonymity, ""played down the frequency of their contact"". ""It is surreal to talk about issues here on air and then word-for-word hear Trump say it two days later,"" Jonessaid on his radio show in August 2016,external. ""It is amazing."" Gertz, from Media Matters for America, says that there is evidence that Jones does talk with the president. But he cautions that both men have had a history of pushing conspiracy theories and presenting ""alternative facts"". ""So trying to nail down for sure what their relationship is, based on the statements that they say about each other, is pretty dicey,"" he says. Less than two weeks after the 2016 presidential election, Jonesposted a video,externalwhich he declared was his ""final statement"" on Sandy Hook. In it, he claimed he had been unfairly treated by the media. ""I've always said I'm not sure what really happened, but there's a lot of anomalies and there has been a cover-up of what did happen there,"" he said. ""There is some evidence that people died there,"" he said. ""I don't know what the truth is, all I know is the official story of Sandy Hook has more holes in it than Swiss cheese."" He then played a montage of news clips and material from his Sandy Hook programmes over the years, including footage of Wolfgang Halbig. He did not include his ""Sandy Hook is a synthetic, completely fake with actors"" quote. In signing off, he took another swipe at parents of murdered children who spoke to the media in the aftermath of the attacks. ""If children were lost in Sandy Hook, my heart goes out to each and every one of those parents and the people who say they're parents that I see on the news. The only problem is, I've seen a lot of soap operas, and I've seen actors before, and I know when I'm watching a movie and when I'm watching something real. Let's look into Sandy Hook."" In front of his computer screen in his undisclosed location, Lenny Pozner is taking on the conspiracy theorists. He flicks through a YouTube page and points out a new video. ""Look - this was just posted,"" he says. ""It's a hoaxer type video - it's insulting, it has images of people who were connected to the tragedy."" The thumbnail picture has a photo of his son Noah's headstone. There's text on the picture which reads: ""empty grave"". In the video, there's a picture of Lenny himself. ""Here's a photo of me taken two days after my child was killed and I'm being called a liar fraud and terrorist,"" he says. ""That's how they vilify people."" Lenny used to be a casual Infowars listener - he liked to listen to conspiracy theories as entertainment. That's how he initially found out that his son's murder was being denied by the conspiracy theorists. At first he tried to engage with them through a Facebook group. But soon the mood among the hard-core hoaxers hardened. ""The only people that would come into the groups were trolls,"" he says. ""They were just coming in for their own amusement... after that I decided that the most important thing would be to start taking down content that's spreading this information,"" he says. Every day, Lenny scrolls though reams of conspiracy minded content, complaining to social networks and attempting to get videos and posts taken down using network rules about copyright, decency and harassment. And he's created an organisation, theHonr Network,external, to help the fight against the hoaxers. After four years of pain, compounded by the harassers and the conspiracy mongers, people in Sandy Hook are tired - and some of them are asking the president to step in. I meet Eric Paradis, a local Democratic Party official, in a bar down the road from Sandy Hook. One of Paradis's daughters was at Sandy Hook Elementary on the day of the shooting - she survived. Although Alex Jones has not been involved in the harassment of the families, Paradis says the president could use his influence to push Jones and the conspiracy theorists to the fringes, and help stop the harassment of Sandy Hook victims. ""The town committee wanted to put a letter together asking the president to denounce these hoaxers and tell them lookâ¦ these are real children who died,"" he says. His letter is still under consideration by local officials. It reads: ""[Jones] continues to spread hate and lies towards our town, towards the people and organizations who came to help us through those darkest days. Jones repeatedly tells his listeners and viewers that he has your ears and your respect. He brags about how you called him after your victory in November. Emboldened by your victory, he continues to hurt the memories of those lost, the ability of those left behind to heal."" The letter goes on to ask Trump to ""intervene and stop Jones and others hoaxers like him"". Paradis says he and other Democrats tried to avoid making the letter about Trump's larger political agenda. ""I really do think he can help us put a stop to it, because he does have a unique position with these hoaxers,"" he says. ""If he can help us out then that's fantastic and a Democrat [like me] would be very grateful if he could."" Lenny Pozner continues to take action against the trolls. He's filed a lawsuit against Halbig, alleging invasion of privacy. Halbig is fighting the suit, which is just getting underway, and says that if he loses, he'll check himself into a mental institution. Lenny turns back to his computer, where he spots more conspiracy theory videos. So will he ever stop trying to fight the hoaxers? He takes a deep breath and a long pause. ""I don't know,"" he says. ""I would like not to have to do this. I would like to just leave it alone and feel the memory of my child is sacred and other people are also treating it that way,"" he says, ""but as long as they're not - I feel I need to defend that memory.""

"More than four years on, Vorayuth Yoovidhaya has not appeared in court Among the many uncertainties hanging over Thailand as it is steered hesitantly through a delicate political transition, its people could be sure of one thing this week. That Vorayuth Yoovidhaya, the grandson of the billionaire who invented the energy drink Red Bull, would once again fail to appear at a Bangkok prosecutor's office to face charges relating to the death of a police officer. On 3 September 2012, that officer was struck by a Ferrari driven by Mr Vorayuth. The sometimes farcical attempts by the Thai authorities to bring Mr Vorayuth to justice are now commonly cited as epitomising the untouchability of the super-rich in Thailand. The facts of the incident early on the morning of 3 September are reasonably clear. Police Sergeant-Major Wichian Klanprasert was riding his motorbike along Bangkok's Sukhumvit Road when he was hit by a grey Ferrari, which dragged his body more than 100m (109yds) down the road, before driving off. Investigating officers followed a trail of brake fluid to a luxury home less than a kilometre away, owned by one of Thailand's wealthiest families. The badly-dented Ferrari was there, but initially the police were persuaded to detain a driver employed by the family as their main suspect. When they subsequently discovered the car had actually been driven by Mr Vorayuth, then 27 years old, he was tested and found to have excessive alcohol in his blood - but, he said, this was from drinking at home after the accident. The badly-dented Ferrari was found in the compound of the family's home The police believe from security camera videos, the distance the car travelled after the crash, and the injuries that instantly killed Sergeant-Major Wichian, that Mr Vorayuth must have been speeding, they estimate at around 170km/h (106mph) in an 80km/h zone. His lawyers have denied this. It took the police six months to prepare criminal charges of speeding, reckless driving causing death, and fleeing the scene of an accident. Throughout 2013, Mr Vorayuth failed to appear seven times to hear the charges, with his lawyers providing an array of justifications, from him being on business overseas to feeling unwell. In September 2013 the limitation period for the speeding charge expired. Mr Vorayuth's grandfather, Chaleo Yoovidhya, made his fortune when, in the mid-1980s, he teamed up with an Austrian marketing executive to turn his energy drink known as Kratindaeng, or Red Bull, into a global sales success. Today the extended Yoovidhya family is believed to be worth more than $20bn (Â£16bn). The Red Bull logo is now seen all over the world, in particular sponsoring spectacular stunts and sporting events. Red Bull sponsors a Formula One team, as well as teams in other motorsports But the family has shunned the limelight; before his death in March 2012 Chaleo Yoovidhya never gave a single media interview. After the accident, his grandson, Mr Vorayuth, vanished from public view. But social media posts by him and his jet-setting friends suggest he has often been inside Thailand, as well as travelling around the world to motor racing competitions or beach resorts. Life and death on Thailand's lethal roads Mexico newspaper stops printing after reporter shot dead The Afghan restaurant run by domestic abuse survivors How Russia's YouTube generation is getting its news Right after the accident the police chief of Bangkok at that time, Kamronwit Thoopkrajang, promised the public that the culprit in Sergeant-Major Wichian's death would be brought to justice, or he would resign. In April 2013 the attorney-general promised to indict Mr Vorayuth, only to backtrack after he was petitioned by the suspect's lawyers, who contested the fairness of the speeding charge. In September 2013 the prosecutor ordered police to arrest him after his seventh no-show. Nothing happened. Then, against a backdrop of growing political turmoil in Thailand, the case appeared to be forgotten. Public interest in it was revived only after a horrifying road accident last year, involving another wealthy young man who drove his luxury car at high speed into another vehicle, killing two graduate students. People started asking what had happened to the Red Bull heir. And a military government, which had promised to address the abuses of previous governments, felt forced to act. Or, perhaps more accurately, to be seen to be acting. In March last year the Attorney-General announced that he would once again press charges against Mr Vorayuth. But throughout last year, his lawyers successfully postponed repeated requests for him to report to the prosecutor's office, claiming that their client had filed a complaint of unfair treatment to the National Legislative Assembly, the military-appointed parliament. Lawyers spoken to by the BBC say there is no legal justification for using this device to delay proceedings against Mr Vorayuth, but that is what is happening. Today the police insist they can do nothing. Asked why they have not issued an arrest warrant against the accused, as requested three and a half years ago, they told the BBC that it is up to the Attorney-General's office to act. The Attorney-General's office says he cannot be indicted unless he appears in person. And for the latest request for him to report to the prosecutor's office to hear those charges? Mr Vorayuth, we are now told by his lawyers, is on business in the UK. The Attorney-General has once again granted a postponement, to next month. The extended Yoovidhya family is believed to be worth more than $20bn (Â£16bn) thanks to their Red Bull empire The relatives of Sergeant-Major Wichian have said little about the case. As usually happens in these situations, the Yoovidhya family have paid them a large sum of money, around $100,000. In return they have agreed not to press charges themselves. And public interest in Thailand will probably wane, as people wearily conclude that, once again, the rich have shown that they are beyond the reach of the law, in a country ridden with corruption and abuses of power. One lawyer, who was once closely connected to the case, told the BBC he had never seen another example of a suspect evading justice like this one. Had it been someone else, without a powerful family behind him, he said, he would certainly have been arrested the first time he failed to report himself. The most serious charge against Mr Vorayuth, of reckless driving causing death, expires in the year 2027. Few people are betting that he will face any legal sanction, or indeed any meaningful restrictions on his lifestyle before that deadline frees him completely from any lingering repercussions of the events of that morning four and a half years ago.

"Afghanistan has been labelled one of the most dangerous places in the world to be a woman. One study suggested 87% of women in the country experience some form of domestic violence. Sodaba Haidare visited one place in the capital Kabul that offers hope to women escaping abuse. Aryan's shift in the kitchen has come to an end. She removes her apron and hat. Glimpses of her personality are revealed - she's wearing a colourful tunic over her black jeans, and she he has a mole exactly between her eyebrows - as if someone planted it in the perfect position. She places a glass of fresh lemon juice on the table sits down across from me. Aryan is strikingly beautiful and moves with confidence. Yet it's hard to believe we are the same age. She is 24 but has the look of a much older woman. It's because of the years of abuse she endured at the hands of her violent husband. She was only 16 when her parents arranged her marriage to a man she'd never met. Soon after the wedding, her husband and mother-in-law started beating her. She stuck it out, hoping things would get better with time. But they got worse. By the time she realised she was in an abusive relationship, she already had three children. From Our Own Correspondenthas insight and analysis from BBC journalists, correspondents and writers from around the world Listen on iPlayer, getthe podcastor listen on the BBC World Service or on Radio 4 on Thursdays at 11:00 BST and Saturdays at 11:30 BST One day, when Aryan's husband left for work, she examined the fresh bruises he'd left on her face, then packed her bags and took her children to the police station. Women who suffer domestic abuse are usually turned away by Afghan police or persuaded to go back to their husbands for their family's honour. But Aryan thought her injuries would make the police take her seriously. And they did. She was sent to a women's shelter, where she and her children lived ever since, with other women who have also escaped domestic violence. She often dreams of a future where she has her own place, where she can live without the fear of her ex-husband coming near her or her children. The path to this dream becoming reality lies in the heart of Kabul. And it begins in a traditionally decorated Afghan restaurant called Bost. Hope is at the heart of its mission. The place is run by survivors of domestic violence and here, women are celebrated as strong, independent human beings, not just victims. Bost is a base for eight women, of all ages. Working empowers them to write a new chapter in their lives. It's a long and often difficult process. Still, it helps that every corner of this restaurant pays homage to powerful women. The place screams female empowerment. Every wall is hung with pictures of women with unique stories. There is Queen Soraya, the wife of King Amanullah, who dressed in European fashion and believed women should shed the veil, and that a man should only have one wife. She was also the minister of education, who opened the country's first school for girls in the 1920s. Then there is the current first lady, Rula Ghani, a Christian-born Lebanese woman, who surprised Afghans by speaking out about women's rights. There are also lesser-known faces, Afghan women who have been killed simply for doing their jobs. Lt Islam Bibi, for example - a young police officer who suffered death threats from her own brother and was then shot down by unknown gunmen on her way to work. Their stories are not forgotten. Another wall pays homage to Afghanistan itself, with images of three different women in vibrant, traditional clothes. They symbolise each region of this fractured nation. There's a small stage, decorated with a handmade Afghan rug. Here female performers sit and play the long-necked string instrument known as the Tambur - or even the guitar or violin. It's an unusual sight in Afghanistan's conservative society, where many believe music should be forbidden - never mind played by women. Now a divorcee, Aryan has adored the three months that she's spent here. It has changed her. She is no longer the insecure and scared woman she once was, who had to raise her arms in self-defence, who would cower at the slightest aggressive word. But her husband has left her with a lasting hatred of men. She thinks all men are abusive - but little by little that's changing too. Here, every day she sees men come to the restaurant with their families - men who are kind and caring. And she sees something that she never experienced. Love.
