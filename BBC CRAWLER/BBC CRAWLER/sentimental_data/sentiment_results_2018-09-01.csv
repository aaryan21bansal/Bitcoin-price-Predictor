"Mr McDonnell said he wanted to avoid a split 'at all costs' Shadow chancellor John McDonnell has revealed he is ""worried and saddened"" about the prospect of the Labour Party splitting over the anti-Semitism row. Mr McDonnelltold the New Statesman,externalhe wanted to avoid a split ""at all costs"" and was happy to talk to unhappy MPs. The party has been at war with itself over the issue throughout the summer. Jewish Labour MPs are meeting in London to demand the party fully adopts the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance guidelines on anti-Semitism. The MPs, who will be addressed by ex-leader Gordon Brown, are seeking to exert pressure on the leadership ahead of Tuesday's meeting of Labour's National Executive Committee - where the matter will be discussed. Analysis: Field is not leading a Labour breakaway Profile: Who is Frank Field? A guide to Labour Party anti-Semitism claims Former MP Ivor Caplin, who is chair of the Jewish Labour Movement, said it and other groups were prepared to have a dialogue with leader Jeremy Corbyn but only if he made it ""very clear"" that he would take firm action against anti-Semites in the party and others engaging in ""bad behaviour"" at a local level. ""The message is simple,"" he said. ""Do what is right for Britain and then we can have further conversations."" Labour has been engulfed by stories about anti-Semitism over the summer with two MPs - John Woodcock and Frank Field - resigning the whip in protest and others threatening to do the same. Mr Field quit the Labour group at Westminster on Thursday over what he called the party's ""tolerance"" of anti-Semitism and a ""culture of nastiness"". In the past month, Mr Corbyn has been criticised for his presence at awreath-laying ceremonyin Tunisia in 2014, which was said to have honoured the perpetrators of the 1972 Munich terror attack. Mr Corbyn said he had attendedto take part in a ceremony honouring innocent victims of a 1985 Israeli air strike. This video can not be played Frank Field says Labour should be a 'champion against racism' Later, footage emerged from 2013 of Mr Corbyn saying a group of British Zionists had ""no sense of English irony"". Former chief rabbi Lord Sacks branded his comments as ""the most offensive statement"" by a politician since Enoch Powell's Rivers of Blood speech. He accused Mr Corbyn of being an ""anti-Semite"" - with the Labour leader saying he was ""more careful"" with language now. In the New Statesman interview, Mr McDonnell said: ""I think there are people who are willing to leave the party"". He went on: ""I don't understand why there is this sort of pre-emptive move to split off. ""So I'm worried and I'm saddened by that, and I think that open door is always there to prevent that happening, because any split is automatically damaging."" Mr McDonnell said a repeat of the early 1980s, when a group of Labour MPs broke away and formed the SDP, would only cost Labour votes. ""So the issue for me is I'd want to avoid at all costs a split if we can."" Lord Blunkett, a Labour member for 55 years, says Mr Field's decision should prompt change in the party Mr McDonnell said he wanted the issues raised by Mr Field and others addressed quickly but, according to the magazine, stopped short of calling for Labour to adopt the IHRA guidelines and all its examples in full. ""I think we can come out of it as the anti-racist party that we are, tackling the real issues,"" he added. ""I don't want to live in a society where synagogues are attacked, or where Jews graveyards daubed with swastikas or worse, Jewish children having to have security at their schools."" Butwriting in the Daily Telegraph,externalon Saturday, former Home Secretary Lord Blunkett urged a rethink of the ""so-called Corbyn project"" and called on the party to abandon ""the recent return to bullying and thuggery experienced in the 1980s"". He told the party to ""belatedly get its act together"" and ""demonstrate the leadership qualities which have been lacking"".

"The prime minister says she is confident of a deal Theresa May has insisted she will not be forced into watering down her Brexit plan during negotiations with the EU. Writing in the Sunday Telegraph,,externalthe prime minister says she will ""not be pushed"" into compromises on her Chequers agreement that are not in the ""national interest"". But Mrs May also warns she will not ""give in"" to those calling for a second referendum on the withdrawal agreement. She says it would be a ""gross betrayal of our democracy and... trust"". The Chequers agreement would see the UK agreeing a ""common rulebook"" with the EU for trading in goods, in an attempt to maintain friction-less trade at the border. But critics say it will leave the UK tied to EU rules and prevent Britain from striking its own trade deals in years to come. The People's Vote, a cross-party group including some MPs, is calling for a public vote on the final Brexit deal. The UK is on course to leave the EU on 29 March but has yet to agree how its final relationship with the bloc will work. The EU has suggested that November is the latest a deal could be finalised. The government had previously ruled out another referendum. Brexit: All you need to know The UK's four Brexit options Key dates and potential hurdles The prime minister writes that the coming months are ""critical in shaping the future of our country"", but that she is ""clear"" about her mission in fulfilling ""the democratic decision of the British people"". She adds that following the Chequers agreement in July - which led to the resignation of two cabinet ministers - ""real progress"" has been made in Brexit negotiations. While there is more negotiating to be done, Mrs May writes: ""We want to leave with a good deal and we are confident we can reach one."" The government has been preparing for a no-deal scenario, even though this would create ""real challenges for both the UK and the EU"" in some sectors, she says. But the PM adds: ""We would get through it and go on to thrive."" She goes on to insist in her article that her government will not back another vote. ""In the summer of 2016, millions came out to have their say,"" she writes. ""In many cases for the first time in decades, they trusted that their vote would count; that after years of feeling ignored by politics, their voices would be heard. ""To ask the question all over again would be a gross betrayal of our democracy - and a betrayal of that trust."" David Davis says the Chequers plan is ""almost worse"" than staying in the EU David Davis, the former Brexit secretary who quit over the Chequers agreement, said he was also against a second referendum. Speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, he said he would vote against the Chequers plan in any Commons vote, adding that it would be ""almost worse"" than staying in the EU. He said the problems around the Northern Ireland border with the Irish Republic had been ""heavily overemphasised"" in the past. ""It's a border already - it works perfectly well with careful co-operation between sides,"" he said, and with ""political will"" from the UK and the Republic, it could continue to do so. By Chris Mason, BBC political correspondent Welcome to the new term in politics - it is getting loud already. No sooner has the prime minister said she is committed to her Brexit blueprint than one of her previously loyal MPs has suggested signing up to it would be a ""humiliation"". And no sooner has she insisted that another Brexit referendum would be a ""gross betrayal of our democracy"" than one of her own party donors says that is ""balderdash"". It seems, to put it mildly, that we are in for quite a political term. Both the big political parties at Westminster have their fair share of turmoil and the stakes could not be higher. But if the last few months, or the last few years, have taught us anything, it is that we can be very confident there will be a few bumps in the road - whether a Brexit deal is done or not. Writing in the same paper,external, Conservative MP Nick Boles - a former minister who backed Remain - said the Chequers policy had ""failed"" and he could no longer support it. He wrote that the EU was treating the plan as ""an opening bid"", and the UK was facing ""the humiliation of a deal dictated by Brussels"". Instead, Mr Boles, who is a member of the Brexit Delivery Group, believes the two-year transition period - which the government describes as an implementation period - should be scrapped and replaced with the UK becoming part of the European Economic Area for three years - giving more time for a trade deal to be negotiated. ""The plan I am setting out represents our only hope of a better Brexit,"" he added. Have voters changed their minds? Among the blue flags: Views from the pro-EU march What kind of Brexit do voters want? The People's Vote launched earlier this year to campaign for a vote on any final Brexit deal, and has a number of high-profile backers, including Sir Patrick Stewart and BBC football anchor Gary Lineker. It has also secured funding from donors including Julian Dunkerton, co-founder of fashion label Superdry - who has given the largest donation of Â£1m to the group. One of its supporters, the Labour MP Chuka Umunna, said the impetus had shifted toward a public vote over the summer and it would be a ""betrayal of democracy"" for Theresa May ""to force a bad deal - or no deal - on Britain without giving the public the chance to have a final say"". The Conservative donor and former Rolls-Royce chairman Sir Simon Robertson has also joined calls for a second referendum, saying he is ""deeply depressed"" at the tone of the Brexit debate. ""I think it is complete balderdash to say the people have spoken, therefore you can't go back. The people can speak again - why can't we have another vote on it?"" he asked, in an interview with thethe Observer,external. Earlier this week,it was revealed in a leaked memothat the People's Vote wants Labour MPs and activists to submit a motion at the party's conference this month, committing Labour to backing a new referendum on the final deal. The party's current policy position is to respect the result of the 2016 Brexit referendum.

"Every avalanche, it is said, starts with a single pebble, and in Westminster terms, Frank Field is a pretty hefty pebble. The chair of the Work and Pensions Committee is one of Parliament's lone wolves - austere and relentless in a series of policy battles stretching back across the decades. On the committee corridor at the Palace of Westminster, he is a formidable figure who has savaged the bosses of Carillion and BHS, been a thorn in the side of Gordon Brown and Tony Blair, and, if your memory stretches back across the decades, the scourge of the Maxwell brothers. So is his departure from the Labour whip the beginning of the much predicted split in the party? Not by design, anyway. Frank Field may trigger by-election Profile: Who is Frank Field? The Brexit factions reshaping UK politics Can Labour detoxify the anti-Semitism row? Mr Field's departure looks very much like a personal decision. Perhaps the most dangerous aspect for Labour is that he has got unhappy MPs (and there are plenty of them) thinking about their own futures. There are several factors in play. First, if the government does manage to get its plans to reduce the number of MPs from 650 to 600 through Parliament - and the final proposed boundaries are expected to be published next week - then something close to a general reselection exercise may follow. That provides Jeremy Corbyn's supporters with an opportunity to remove those who don't support their leader. Labour's National Executive Committee (NEC) and the party conference will have to approve a set of rules to deal with that eventuality, and the details of those rules, and the level of protection they afford to sitting MPs will be studied very closely by those who fear they are under threat. If the rules look like the vehicle for a purge, there will be trouble ahead, and some Labour MPs will calculate they have nothing to lose. Jeremy Corbyn is hoping to draw a line under the anti-Semitism row There are also wider concerns about a more general revamp of party structures proposed by the former MP and close Corbyn ally Katy Clark, which would entrench the left's organisational grip. Then there's Brexit. Some of Mr Corbyn's most vocal internal critics are those who believe Labour should now be campaigning for a second referendum. They will be loath to upset the applecart while there is a chance of getting organised, cohesive Labour backing behind a Commons vote which could achieve that - and they will be looking to the forthcoming party conference to see if party policy will change, perhaps on the back of union votes. It follows that they may rethink their position if that vote doesn't materialise and the UK leaves the EU. On the other side of the coin, the four Labour MPs, Frank Field included, who voted with the government and saved it from defeat in a crucial Brexit vote in the Commons in July, have also taken considerable flak; but there are significant electoral dangers in Labour purging its Brexiteers - remember that the seats Labour lost in 2017 were mostly in Leave-voting areas. Mr Corbyn's critics are at the centre of press speculation More dangerous and immediate is the anti-Semitism issue which has dogged Labour through the summer. Crucial votes on Labour's approach to it take place in the National Executive Committee next week, and then the Parliamentary Labour Party, which might defuse, or detonate the whole issue. It is hard to understate the level of fury on both sides of this row, which is why it could easily run out of control. Words have already been spoken which make it hard to imagine the protagonists kissing and making up - but a serious attempt to discipline MPs like Margaret Hodge or Ian Austin, the most vocal critics of Mr Corbyn on this issue, could trigger a walkout by their supporters. Any new party would have to attract Labour MPs like Chuka Umunna What is harder to see is how these different strands of dissent could gel into a coherent breakaway. Take Mr Field. He is not part of any Labour tribe, and he certainly does not fit neatly into the vocal group of Blairite holdouts who are Mr Corbyn's loudest critics. For a start, reflecting his Birkenhead constituency, he's a Brexiteer, so any idea that he's about to line up with Labour's hardcore Remainers at some grand launch ceremony for a new party is a non-starter. And this illustrates a wider point; there are plenty of Labour MPs who don't like Mr Corbyn, but they don't necessarily agree on much else. To work, a new party would have to be more than a lifeboat for shipwrecked careers. It would need a unifying idea under which a critical mass of activists, as well as MPs, could gather (political parties need infantry as well as generals) and it would certainly need to attract people from beyond the Labour Party. That would require devising policies which might attract Tory dissidents like Anna Soubry, as well as Labour figures like Chris Leslie or Chuka Umunna. And such a party would also require leaders, and here there's another problem - if the 1980s SDP is the model, the possible MP defectors include plenty of Bill Rogers types, but no Roy Jenkins, Shirley Williams or David Owen - big, recognisable popular figures. The SDP's gang of four: Bill Rodgers, Shirley Williams, Roy Jenkins and David Owen My guess is the biggest threat to Labour unity is that the case of Mr Field raises the temperature and the pot starts to boil; that deselection threats escalate and that more and more MPs consider their positions. Close Corbyn ally Chris Williamson spent the summer pushing for local parties with MPs who are leadership opponents to deselect their incumbents and choose someone more congenial. Until now, many MPs uncomfortable with the Corbyn leadership have bided their time, but if they sense a real threat to their personal positions - and if the party that nurtured them seems to be changing out of recognition - then the bets may be off. Political parties are held together by more than ideology - for their members they can be a family tradition and a way of life, providing friendships and social life. Those links are hard to break, but there is a sense that for many Labour MPs and members, they are fraying. And across the party divide, the Conservatives, who are developing reselection rumbles and talk of purges of their own, are watching with a combination of opportunism and fear.

"The Campaign Against anti-Semitism stages a protest in 2018 The internal Labour row over anti-Semitism has dragged on for several years. Here's a guide to what's been going on. In October 2020, a report bythe UK's human rights watchdog found Labourto be responsible for ""unlawful"" acts of harassment and discrimination during Jeremy Corbyn's four-and a-half years as party leader. The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) investigation identified serious failings in leadership and an inadequate process of handling anti-Semitism complaints. Its report said the party was responsible for three breaches of the Equality Act: political interference in anti-Semitism complaints, failure to provide adequate training to those handling anti-Semitism complaints and harassment. In a statement, it said: ""The equality body's analysis points to a culture within the party which, at best, did not do enough to prevent anti-Semitism and, at worst, could be seen to accept it."" The commission served an unlawful act notice on the party, meaning it has to produce an action plan within six weeks, which is legally enforceable by the courts if not acted upon. The inquiry was launched in May 2019 after ""receiving a number of complaints about allegations of anti-Semitism in the party"". Responding to the report, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said it was ""a day of shame for the Labour Party"" and apologised to the Jewish community. He said the party would implement all the report's recommendations in full and promised a ""culture change"" in Labour. He added: ""Under my leadership, zero-tolerance of anti-Semitism will mean precisely that. If you're anti-Semitic, you should be nowhere near this Party. And we'll make sure you're not. ""And if - after all the pain, all the grief, and all the evidence in this report, there are still those who think there's no problem with anti-Semitism in the Labour Party, that it's all exaggerated, or a factional attack, then, frankly, you are part of the problem too. And you should be nowhere near the Labour Party either."" Sir Keir's predecessor as leader, Jeremy Corbyn, said he did not accept all of the report's findings but expressed the hope that the recommendations would be ""swiftly implemented"". He said ""anyone claiming there is no anti-Semitism in the Labour Party is wrong"" but added that ""the scale of the problem was also dramatically overstated for political reasons by our opponents inside and outside the party, as well as by much of the media"". Labour suspended Mr Corbyn from the party and removed the whip, meaning he would no longer be part of the Parliamentary Labour Party. In a statement, the party said: ""In light of his comments made today and his failure to retract them subsequently, the Labour Party has suspended Jeremy Corbyn pending investigation."" Three weeks later, Labour's ruling body - the National Executive Committee (NEC) - decided to readmit Mr Corbyn as a party member. But this did not mean he would automatically be reinstated as a Labour MP, and Sir Keir decided not to restore the whip to his predecessor - meaning Mr Corbyn will continue to sit in the House of Commons as an independent. Sir Keir promised to keep the situation under review, but allies of Mr Corbyn have urged him to change his mind immediately, saying the former leader is being ""persecuted"". Bring back 'persecuted' Corbyn, allies demand Jewish people have faced prejudice and hostility for centuries. During World War II, six million Jews were murdered by the Nazis or their accomplices in what is known as the Holocaust. Modern-day anti-Semitism can take many forms including, but not limited to, conspiracy theories about Jewish control of the global financial system and the media, to attacks on synagogues, verbal abuse or hate speech and abusive memes on social media. In 2018, anti-Semitic hate incidents in the UK reached a record high,according to the Community Security Trust,external, which monitors them. In 2016, the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) adopteda working definition of anti-Semitism,externalwhich described it as ""a certain perception of Jews, which may be expressed as hatred toward Jews"". The UK and a number of other IHRA members haveadopted or endorsed the working definition,external, as well as a series of accompanying ""contemporary"" examples of how anti-Semitism manifests itself in public life. These include Holocaust denial, denying the Jewish people their right to self-determination (through the existence of a State of Israel), and holding Jews collectively responsible for the actions of that state. Labour got itself into trouble over the definition - as we'll explain later. Debates about anti-Semitism in Labour often involve Israel and the term ""Zionism"". In its modern sense, Zionism refers to support for Israel's existence and prosperity. It began as a political movement in Europe in the late 19th Century which sought to develop Jewish nationhood in the land known as Palestine - also known to Jews as the ancient Land of Israel. The movement evolved and eventually led to the creation of the State of Israel in 1948. Some say ""Zionist"" can be used as a coded attack on Jewish people, while others say the Israeli government and its supporters are deliberately confusing anti-Zionism with anti-Semitism to avoid criticism. Attitudes to Israel in the UK, and on the left in particular, are influenced by its troubled relationship with its Arab neighbours and its long conflict with the Palestinians. A 2016 report by the Home Affairs Committee of MPs backed the IHRA definition of anti-Semitism but said it should include an additional statement to maintain freedom of speech ""in the context of discourse about Israel and Palestine"". This, it said, should read ""it is not anti-Semitic to criticise the Israeli government without additional evidence to suggest anti-Semitic intent"" or to hold Israel ""to the same standards as other liberal democracies or to take a particular interest in the Israeli government's policies or actions, without additional evidence to suggest ant-Semitic intent"". Read more about the difference between anti-Semitism and anti-Zionism The anti-Semitism row was a constant backdrop to Jeremy Corbyn's leadership Anti-Semitism was generally not regarded as a big problem in the Labour Party before Jeremy Corbyn's election as leader in September 2015. Mr Corbyn and his allies on the left had spent decades campaigning for Palestinian statehood, in contrast with the more nuanced position taken by many of his predecessors. Under his leadership, there was an influx of new members, many of whom were vocal critics of Israel and who believed the UK, along with the US, should be tougher towards Israel, especially regarding its policies towards the Palestinians and its building of settlements in the occupied territories. As the balance of power within Labour changed after Mr Corbyn's election as leader, attention quickly focused on what activists and elected representatives were saying - and had said in the past - on social media and elsewhere about Israel and Jewish people. There were claims that anti-Semitic tropes were being widely propagated and a number of incidents attracted a great deal of attention. There were a string of high-profile suspensions over alleged anti-Semitic comments - and constant accusations, from Jewish groups and some of his own MPs, that Mr Corbyn and his team were failing to take the issue seriously enough. The row threatened to the tear the party apart, with several high-profile MPs walking out over abuse they received. Mr Corbyn repeatedly insisted that anti-Jewish hate would not be tolerated in the party, but critics said he was not doing enough to root out the problem. In April 2018, Jennie Formby, an ally of Mr Corbyn, took over as Labour's general secretary and set about tightening up the party's disciplinary procedures and recruiting more staff to deal with anti-Semitism cases. The full story of the controversies over Mr Corbyn's position on anti-Semitism in the Labour Party are set out below. But let's now look at efforts by the man elected to replace him as leader in March 2020, Sir Keir Starmer, to draw a line under the issue. When Sir Keir Starmer was elected Labour leader in April, he made tackling anti-Semitism a top priority, promising to ""tear out this poison by its roots"" in his acceptance speech. In a video conference with Jewish leaders, the new Labour leader and his deputy, Angela Rayner, said they would set up an independent complaints procedure and review all outstanding cases. This was welcomed by Jewish leaders, whosaid in a joint statementthat Sir Keir had ""achieved more in four days"" than Mr Corbyn did ""in four years"". Shortly afterwards, an internal report into the party's handling of anti-Semitism cases, written in the final month of Mr Corbyn's tenure, was leaked. The 860 page dossiersaid that factional hostilitytowards Mr Corbyn's leadership among senior party staff had led to a ""litany of mistakes"" that hindered the handling of anti-Semitism allegations. Opponents of Mr Corbyn claimed the report was leaked in an attempt to ""smear whistleblowers"", who had spoken to the Equalities and Human Rights Commission investigation. But supporters of the former leader are incensed about alleged evidence that senior former staff members ""openly worked against the aims and objectives"" of the party leadership. The report included thousands of emails and private WhatsApp messages, by named individuals, which allegedly show hostility towards Mr Corbyn, party members and policies. Sir Keir has ordered an inquiry into the contents of the report and how it was leaked to the media, which is still ongoing. In July this year, the Labour Partyagreed to pay ""substantial"" damagesto seven former employees who spoke out about anti-Semitism, in a BBC Panorama programme. The party issued an unreserved apology in the High Court for making ""false and defamatory"" comments about the seven whistleblowers. Labour to report on anti-Semitism leak in July Labour names head of leaked report investigation Sir Keirsacked his shadow education secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey in June 2020, saying she had shared an article containing an anti-Semitic conspiracy theory. Mrs Long-Bailey had retweeted an interview with actor and Labour supporter Maxine Peake, later saying she had not meant to endorse all aspects of the article. In the article, Ms Peake discussed the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, saying: ""The tactics used by the police in America, kneeling on George Floyd's neck, that was learnt from seminars with Israeli secret services."" The Independent article also quoted the Israeli police denying Ms Peake's claim saying: ""There is no tactic or protocol that calls to put pressure on the neck or airway."" Ms Peake later tweeted that she had been ""inaccurate in my assumption of American police training and its sources"". Allegations of anti-Semitism against party members and supporters dogged Jeremy Corbyn's four-and-half years as Labour leader. Among those suspended by the party for alleged anti-Semitism were MP Naz Shah, the ex-London Mayor Ken Livingstone and MP Chris Williamson, an ally and friend of Mr Corbyn. Chris Williamson was one of a number of prominent figures to be suspended Ms Shah apologisedfor a string of comments on Facebook, including one suggesting Israel should be moved to the United States, although she was subsequently re-instated. She has since gone on to play a leading role in the fight against anti-Semitism in the party. Mr Livingstone quit the partyafter a long-running row over claims Adolf Hitler had once supported Zionism while Mr Williamson was stripped of his membership for saying the problem of anti-Semitism had been over-stated and Labourhad been ""too apologetic""over the issue. Mr Williamsonwas allowed back into the partyseveral months after his suspension, but wassuspended again two days later.pending further consideration of his future. In October 2019, he lost a High Court bid to be reinstated and was unable to stand for re-election as a Labour candidate in Derby North, He stood as an independent but lost his seat. In 2016, Jeremy Corbyn asked the barrister and human rights campaigner Shami Chakrabarti - who was appointed a Labour peer soon after her report was published - to look into the extent of anti-Semitism and other forms of racism within the party. The report concluded that while Labour was not ""overrun by anti-Semitism or other forms of racism"", there was an ""occasionally toxic atmosphere"". It made a series of recommendations to tackle what it said was the ""clear evidence of ignorant attitudes"" within sections of the party. The report's launch was marred, though, by averbal confrontation which led to the expulsion of activist Marc Wadsworthfrom the party after he criticised a Jewish MP. The time it has taken to implement the Chakrabarti report has been criticised Labour's former general secretary Jennie Formbysaid she had strengthened and speeded up,externalthe party's disciplinary procedures, with more staff to handle investigations but Baroness Chakrabarti - then Labour's shadow attorney general - criticised the pace of progress. A 2016 Home Affairs Committee report said the leadership's lack of action ""risks lending force to allegations that elements of the Labour movement are institutionally anti-Semitic"". In early 2019, Labour approachedformer Lord Chancellor Lord Falconer, who replaced Baroness Chakrabarti as the shadow attorney general, about leading a review into its complaints process, which critics said had become politicised. This, in turn, led to complaints from prominent Jewish MPs that he was too close to the party for any review to be independent. But in a politically damaging move, the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) announced its own investigation into anti-Semitism in the party. It is only the second time the EHRC has investigated a political party - in 2010, it ordered the BNP to re-write its constitution to comply with race relation laws. A Labour spokesman rejected ""any suggestion that the party does not handle ant-Semitism complaints fairly and robustly, or that the party has acted unlawfully"". Labour 'not overrun by anti-Semitism' The party faced further criticism following a BBC Panorama calledIs Labour Anti-Semitic? The programme spoke to a number of party officials who alleged that senior Labour figures - namely Ms Formby and communications chief Seumas Milne, who stood down when Mr Corbyn departed -had interfered in the processof dealing with anti-Semitism complaints. The disputes team is supposed to operate independently from the party's political structures, including the leader's office. The whistleblowers also claimed they had faced a huge increase in anti-Semitism complaints since Mr Corbyn became leader in 2015. Seumas Milne and Jennie Formby were accused of interfering in Labour's disciplinary process Labour strenuously disputed the claims, insisting there was no interference and the former staff were ""disaffected"" individuals with ""personal and political axes to grind"". It also said the programme was ""heavily slanted and inaccurate"" - a suggestion Panorama has rejected. The party's then deputy leader, Tom Watson, saidhe ""deplored"" the official responseto the documentary, and other senior figures joined him tocall on the leadership to listen to the concerns it raised. MPs and peers are nowpushing for a fully independent complaints process. In July 2018, Labour adopted a new anti-Semitism code which critics, including Jewish leaders and some Labour MPs, said fell unacceptably short of the IHRA definition. Labour's version did not include a number of its examples of anti-Semitism, including: accusing Jewish people of being more loyal to Israel than their home country requiring higher standards of behaviour from Israel than other nations Following a consultation - and widespread criticism - Labour subsequently adopted the fullIHRA definition and examples,external, along with an accompanying statement that ""this will not in any way undermine freedom of expression on Israel or the rights of Palestinians"". Critics have said the addition of a ""caveat"" undermines the IHRA definition - but Labour says it is intended to reassure members they can be critical of Israel without being anti-Semitic. Mr Corbyn proposed a longer additional statement - which would have allowed criticism of the foundation of the state of Israel as a racist endeavour - but this was not accepted by the party's ruling executive. Throughout his time as Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn insisted there was no place in the party for anti-Semitism. Some of his supporters said the problem had been exaggerated and was being used as a stick to beat him by people who didn't like his leadership of the party or his views on the Middle East. The former Labour leader comes from a different political tradition than virtually every other post-war Labour leader, having campaigned for 40 years against Western imperialism and aggression. Mr Corbyn's opponents accused him of being too close to Hamas, a militant Islamist group, and Hezbollah, a Lebanese paramilitary group. Both groups are widely viewed in the West as terrorist organisations. He described representatives of Hamas as his ""friends"" after inviting them to a controversial meeting in Parliament in 2009. He later said he regretted his use of language, but insisted his motivation in talking to enemies of Israel was the promotion of peace in the Middle East. But his critics argued his views created the space for anti-Semitism to flourish in the party and he had condoned anti-Jewish prejudice through several of his own actions. Mr Corbyn faced criticism in August 2018 after a video emergedon the Daily Mail website,externalof a 2013 clip in which he said a group of British Zionists ""don't understand English irony"". Former chief rabbi Lord Sacks brandedthe comments ""the most offensive statement"" by a politician since Enoch Powell's ""Rivers of Blood"" speech and accused the Labour leader of being an anti-Semite. Mr Corbyn said he had used the term ""Zionist"" in an ""accurate political sense and not as a euphemism for Jewish people"". He added: ""I am now more careful with how I might use the term 'Zionist' because a once self-identifying political term has been increasingly hijacked by anti-Semites as code for Jews."" In August 2018, the then Labour leader also came under fire over his presence at a ceremony in Tunisia in 2014 which is said to have honoured the perpetrators of the 1972 Munich massacre, during which 11 members of the Israeli Olympic team were taken hostage by Palestinian militants and killed. The Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Mr Corbyn deserved ""unequivocal condemnation"" for laying a wreath on the grave of one of those behind the atrocity. Mr Corbyntweeted,externalthat Mr Netanyahu's claims about his ""actions and words are false"", adding: ""What deserves unequivocal condemnation is the killing of over 160 Palestinian protesters in Gaza by Israeli forces since March, including dozens of children."" Mr Corbyn said he had attended the event in Tunis as part of a wider event about the search for peace. Corbyn wreath row explained Earlier in August 2018, Jeremy Corbyn apologised over an event he hosted as a backbench MP in 2010 where a Holocaust survivor compared Israel to Nazism. Afterthe Times published details of the event,external, the then Labour leader said he had ""on occasion appeared on platforms with people whose views I completely reject"" and was sorry for the ""concerns and anxiety that this has caused"". Corbyn apologises over 2010 event Mr Corbyn apologised for not condemning an anti-Semitic mural in London In March 2018, Mr Corbyn was criticised for sending an apparently supportive message to the creator of an allegedly anti-Semitic mural in 2012. In a message sent via Facebook, he had appeared to question a decision to remove the artist's controversial work from a wall in east London. He later said he had not looked at it properly, calling it ""deeply disturbing and anti-Semitic"". The artist, called Mear One, denied this, saying the mural was about ""class and privilege"". Following the row, Mr Corbyn said he was ""sincerely sorry for the pain"" caused and conceded there were ""pockets"" of anti-Semitism within the party. Corbyn 'regret' over anti-Semitic mural row Luciana Berger said she had become ashamed of the party she joined as a teenager Unease within Labour ranks in Parliament intensified in 2017 and 2018 amid concerns the leadership was not doing enough to defend Jewish MPs, such as Luciana Berger, who were themselves the targets of anti-Semitic abuse and death threats. In March 2018, scores of Labour MPs joined Jewish groups, including the Jewish Leadership Council and the Board of Deputies of British Jews, and other anti-racism campaigners to demand action in an unprecedented ""Enough is Enough"" rally outside Parliament. In a further sign of the breakdown in trust between Labour and the Jewish community, the Jewish Labour Movement considered severing its century-old affiliation to the party. While deciding to retain its ties, the organisation of 2,000 members did pass a motion of no confidence in Mr Corbyn and voted to describe the party as ""institutionally anti-Semitic"". Eighth MP quits Labour for Independent Group Shadow cabinet clash over anti-Semitism In February 2019, nine MPs quit Labour, many of them citing the leadership's handling of anti-Semitism as their reason for leaving. Ms Berger, who had a police escort at the 2018 Labour Party conference, said she had come to the ""sickening conclusion"" that the party had become institutionally anti-Semitic and that she was ""embarrassed and ashamed"" to stay. Ms Berger's supporters, including then deputy leader Tom Watson, claimed she has been ""bullied out of her own party by racist thugs"". Among the other defectors, Joan Ryan claimed the party had ""become infected with the scourge of anti-Jewish racism"" while Ian Austin blamed Mr Corbyn for ""creating a culture of extremism and intolerance"". Eight of the defectors joined the newly formed Independent Group, which became Change UK, but three, including Luciana Berger, went on to join the Liberal Democrats, and failed to get elected at the 2019 general election. The two that remained in Change UK lost their seats, while Gavin Shuker, who stood as an independent, also lost his seat. Joan Ryan and Ann Coffey decided not to stand for re-election. Ian Austin did not join The Independent Group and stood down at the 2019 general election, advising his constituents to vote Conservative to stop Jeremy Corbyn. In March 2018, the head of the Labour Party's disputes panel quit after it emerged she had opposed the suspension of a council candidate accused of Holocaust denial. Christine Shawcroft said she had not not been aware of the ""abhorrent"" Facebook post that had led to his suspension In July 2018, the UK's three main Jewish newspapers published the same front page, warning that a government led by Mr Corbyn would pose an ""existential threat to Jewish life"". Earlier that month the party brought disciplinary action against the Labour MP Margaret Hodge, after she reportedly called Mr Corbyn an ""anti-Semite"" and a ""racist"". Ms Hodge refused to apologise and the action was later dropped. Frank Field, the MP for Birkenhead since 1979, quit the party's group in Parliament in August 2018, saying the leadership had become ""a force for anti-Semitism in British politics"". He stood as an independent at the 2019 general election but lost his seat to the Labour candidate. In May 2019, a member of Labour's ruling National Executive Committee - Peter Willsman - was suspended afterLBC radio reported,externalhe had been recorded as saying that the Israeli embassy was ""almost certainly"" behind the anti-Semitism row. And Labour's successful candidate in the Peterborough by-election, Lisa Forbes, was engulfed in a row after it emerged she had liked a social media post suggesting Theresa May had a ""Zionist slave masters agenda"". She apologised and calls for her to be suspended were rejected but the controversy led to fresh ructions and claims racism had become ""institutionalised"" within the party. Correction 26 May 2021: An earlier version of this article reported that 30 members of the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) had accepted the IHRA's working definition. This was not accurate at the time of writing and this line has been amended in the story. Update 25th June 2019: Although intended as a general guide, an earlier version of this article omitted some relevant information and it has since been updated. Correction 23rd July 2019:  An earlier version of this article inaccurately said that Labour has never confirmed the number of anti-Semitism cases it is investigating and this has been amended to confirm that the party did release figures for a 10 month period in 2018/19.

"When MPs return from their summer recess, Britain's departure from the EU will be fast approaching. Here are the key dates and parliamentary battles on the road to Brexit. 20 September- EU leaders are expected to discuss Brexit, although a full summit has been ruled out 17-18 October- EU summit. This has been seen as a deadline for an agreement setting out the terms of UK-EU ""divorce"" - the so-called withdrawal agreement - to allow enough time for the UK Parliament and the European Parliament to ratify it. A political declaration on the future relationship between the UK and the EU is also expected at this point November- The EU has suggested this month is the latest a deal could be finalised. There is speculation that an emergency EU summit on Brexit might be held in this month, if a withdrawal agreement and a declaration on the future relationship are not reached in October If a deal has been agreed, MPs will be asked to approve it 13-14 December- EU summit. If a deal has not been done by October, this is the fallback option if the two sides still want to reach an agreement Ratification of the withdrawal agreement by the UK Parliament and the European Parliament. 21 January- If the government has not presented its withdrawal agreement by this date, powers for MPs to influence ministers' next steps will kick in 21-22 March- The final summit that the UK is expected to attend as a member of the EU Before 29 March- Parliament will have to pass the European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Bill to implement the withdrawal agreement, assuming it was approved by Parliament beforehand 29 March, at 2300 GMT- The UK leaves the EU. A special summit of the 27 other EU countries soon after the UK's exit is expected, but has not yet been scheduled 23-26MayElections for the European Parliament in 27 EU countries (the UK will no longer be represented in the parliament) 31 December- If all goes to plan, this will be the last date of the transition period What is it? If and when ministers return with a deal, MPs will vote on the withdrawal agreement and the framework for the future partnership. This will act as the ""meaningful vote"" promised to MPs by the prime minister. The rules surrounding what happens if things don't go to plan were written into law in the Withdrawal Act: In the event that MPs refuse to approve the withdrawal agreement or no deal is reached by 21 January 2019, the government will have to present its plans for next steps to Parliament. MPs will then be able to vote to endorse the statement. When? Soon after the withdrawal agreement has been finalised (expected by the end of October 2018). The government has said the vote will take place before the European Parliament votes on the agreement. Potential flashpoints This vote is potentially the biggest threat to the government's plans. Ministers have presented the vote as a decision between approving their withdrawal agreement and ""no deal"". Assuming the Opposition votes against the agreement, the government's fate will lie in the hands of its own backbenchers. MPs who support a hard Brexit, such as Jacob Rees-Mogg, have made it clear they would be prepared to vote against the deal if it does not prove sufficient, but the pro-Remain Conservatives could also join Labour in the voting lobbies if they are unconvinced. A complex but crucial factor is what happens in the case of no deal or Parliament's rejection of the deal. The final version of the Withdrawal Act stated that in the case of no deal by January or MPs rejecting a deal the government would have to present its new plans to MPs in a ""neutral motion"". This could be along the lines of ""This House has considered"" the government's plans for next steps, giving MPs little power to influence the plans. However, if Speaker John Bercow decides the motion is amendable, MPs could change its wording. They could theoretically change the motion to direct the government on their next steps. Please upgrade your browser What is it? Another law that needs to be passed before the UK leaves the EU. It will enshrine the withdrawal agreement in law and give legal effect to whatever transition period is agreed. The difference between this and the motion in Parliament is that the motion is there to approve the withdrawal agreement while the bill is there to implement it. When? The bill probably cannot be written until there is a withdrawal agreement and it must be passed before Brexit day (29 March 2019). MPs complicated the process in December when they passed an amendment to the Withdrawal Bill - proposed by Conservative MP Dominic Grieve - that would require this bill to be passed before the government can use secondary legislation to implement Brexit. This means the vote on this bill will act as another ""meaningful vote"". Potential flashpoints It is unclear what would happen if Parliament rejected the bill. What is it? Under the Withdrawal Bill, the government has the power to make changes to laws that need to happen before Brexit day. This is called secondary legislation and is often used to make small technical changes to laws. But opposition politicians have warned that excessive use of these powers could be undemocratic. When? The powers are contained in the Withdrawal Act. But after MPs voted for Mr Grieve's amendment, ministers will not be allowed to use the powers until the Withdrawal Agreement Bill has been passed. What is it? The final withdrawal agreement will have to be ratified as an international treaty. The government has to present international treaties to both Houses of Parliament. If neither House raises objections, the treaty is passed and does not necessarily have to be debated or voted on. If there is an objection, ministers have 21 days to explain the merits of the treaty, before presenting it to Parliament again. This could technically be repeated several times. When? The government has said the treaty will have to be ratified before the withdrawal agreement can ""enter into force"". Potential flashpoints It is unlikely that there would be a vote - or even a debate - on the treaty, seeing as the issues will have already been debated and voted on in the meaningful vote. Theoretically, Parliament could vote against the treaty, but it will not be able to amend it. Of course, this all depends on them having a treaty to ratifyâ¦ The EU and the UK have to agree on the terms of the UK's departure - as well as agreeing the outline for the trading relationship they will have after Brexit. A number of sticking points remain. Here are the main issues that need to be sorted out (there are a lot of smaller ones too -you can read more about those here). This is the biggest sticking point. Both sides have committed to avoiding the return of a hard border, including physical infrastructure or related checks and controls, between Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. They want to achieve this by agreeing a new trade deal with the continuation of open borders. But in the event that this is not possible both sides have agreed to have a ""backstop"" solution that would keep the Irish border open. Brussels' proposed solution would see Northern Ireland stick to those rules of the customs union and single market that are required for cross-border co-operation to continue. But the UK government is against this idea, saying it would effectively separate Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK and create a border in the Irish Sea. Instead the UK would like to see the backstop apply to the entire UK, but negotiators are yet to find a solution that is acceptable to both sides. Gibraltar and Cyprus The sides must still agree on what terms Gibraltar will be able to participate in the transition agreement. The EU's negotiating guidelines state that ""no agreement between the EU and the United Kingdom may apply to the territory of Gibraltar without the agreement between the Kingdom of Spain and the United Kingdom"", which some have interpreted as the EU giving the Spanish veto over the final deal. Madrid is said to be seeking joint management of Gibraltar's airport and greater co-operation on tax fraud and tobacco smuggling in return for allowing the withdrawal agreement to cover the Rock. The UK and the EU will also have to find a solution for British military bases in Cyprus. The UK has set store by establishing a high level of co-operation on security issues, like counter-terrorism and the fight against organised crime, with the EU after Brexit. But there are significant disagreements about how this will work - and the EU's decision to exclude the UK from the Galileo satellite system on security grounds was said by the UK to show a lack of trust. The UK thinks that co-operation on extradition, the British relationship with the EU crime-fighting agency Europol and the sharing of criminal records should be the subject of a separate security treaty which the two sides should begin negotiating straight away. UK wants Â£1bn Galileo costs back from EU Theresa May security pledge at EU summit This is another issue that could bring the whole deal down, according to Michel Barnier. The UK is committed to pulling out of the European Court of Justice, the mechanism used to settle disputes between member states by interpreting and enforcing single market rules - but it does want to stay close to some of the EU's rules. The EU has proposed a joint committee made up of representatives appointed by London and Brussels. If they can't solve a problem, it would be referred to the European Court of Justice. The UK government likes the idea of a joint committee but not of the European Court of Justice having the final say in all circumstances and only wants certain cases referred by the committee to the ECJ. This is how the Brexit process is meant to go - but the UK or the EU could pull the plug on talks at any time. And, in theory, the UK and the other 27 EU members could agree to change the timetable or even halt the process Brexit altogether. As the European Commission likes to say, ""nothing is agreed until everything is agreed"".

"Mr McDonnell said he wanted to avoid a split 'at all costs' Shadow chancellor John McDonnell has revealed he is ""worried and saddened"" about the prospect of the Labour Party splitting over the anti-Semitism row. Mr McDonnelltold the New Statesman,externalhe wanted to avoid a split ""at all costs"" and was happy to talk to unhappy MPs. The party has been at war with itself over the issue throughout the summer. Jewish Labour MPs are meeting in London to demand the party fully adopts the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance guidelines on anti-Semitism. The MPs, who will be addressed by ex-leader Gordon Brown, are seeking to exert pressure on the leadership ahead of Tuesday's meeting of Labour's National Executive Committee - where the matter will be discussed. Analysis: Field is not leading a Labour breakaway Profile: Who is Frank Field? A guide to Labour Party anti-Semitism claims Former MP Ivor Caplin, who is chair of the Jewish Labour Movement, said it and other groups were prepared to have a dialogue with leader Jeremy Corbyn but only if he made it ""very clear"" that he would take firm action against anti-Semites in the party and others engaging in ""bad behaviour"" at a local level. ""The message is simple,"" he said. ""Do what is right for Britain and then we can have further conversations."" Labour has been engulfed by stories about anti-Semitism over the summer with two MPs - John Woodcock and Frank Field - resigning the whip in protest and others threatening to do the same. Mr Field quit the Labour group at Westminster on Thursday over what he called the party's ""tolerance"" of anti-Semitism and a ""culture of nastiness"". In the past month, Mr Corbyn has been criticised for his presence at awreath-laying ceremonyin Tunisia in 2014, which was said to have honoured the perpetrators of the 1972 Munich terror attack. Mr Corbyn said he had attendedto take part in a ceremony honouring innocent victims of a 1985 Israeli air strike. This video can not be played Frank Field says Labour should be a 'champion against racism' Later, footage emerged from 2013 of Mr Corbyn saying a group of British Zionists had ""no sense of English irony"". Former chief rabbi Lord Sacks branded his comments as ""the most offensive statement"" by a politician since Enoch Powell's Rivers of Blood speech. He accused Mr Corbyn of being an ""anti-Semite"" - with the Labour leader saying he was ""more careful"" with language now. In the New Statesman interview, Mr McDonnell said: ""I think there are people who are willing to leave the party"". He went on: ""I don't understand why there is this sort of pre-emptive move to split off. ""So I'm worried and I'm saddened by that, and I think that open door is always there to prevent that happening, because any split is automatically damaging."" Mr McDonnell said a repeat of the early 1980s, when a group of Labour MPs broke away and formed the SDP, would only cost Labour votes. ""So the issue for me is I'd want to avoid at all costs a split if we can."" Lord Blunkett, a Labour member for 55 years, says Mr Field's decision should prompt change in the party Mr McDonnell said he wanted the issues raised by Mr Field and others addressed quickly but, according to the magazine, stopped short of calling for Labour to adopt the IHRA guidelines and all its examples in full. ""I think we can come out of it as the anti-racist party that we are, tackling the real issues,"" he added. ""I don't want to live in a society where synagogues are attacked, or where Jews graveyards daubed with swastikas or worse, Jewish children having to have security at their schools."" Butwriting in the Daily Telegraph,externalon Saturday, former Home Secretary Lord Blunkett urged a rethink of the ""so-called Corbyn project"" and called on the party to abandon ""the recent return to bullying and thuggery experienced in the 1980s"". He told the party to ""belatedly get its act together"" and ""demonstrate the leadership qualities which have been lacking"".

"Unrwa provides health and education services to Palestinians Palestinian officials have condemned the US decision to end all funding to the UN's Palestinian refugee agency. The US has been the largest donor to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (Unrwa) - but now says the organisation is ""irredeemably flawed"". Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas's spokesman has called the move a ""flagrant assault against the Palestinian people"". However, an Israeli official told AFP: ""Israel supports the US move"". Unrwa says it currently supports more than five million Palestinians in Gaza, the West Bank, Jordan, Syria and Lebanon, including providing health care, education and social services. The US has been the largest single donor to Unrwa, providing $368m (Â£284m) in 2016 and funding almost 30% of its operations in the region. But in January, the administration of President Donald Trump withheld more than half of its planned funding to Unrwa, saying it would keep back $65m unless the body carried out ""reforms"". Palestinians fear cost of Trump's aid cut UN alarm as US cuts aid to Palestinians On Friday, the US state department said in a statement that ""the US will no longer commit further funding to this irredeemably flawed operation"". The state department said the US had shouldered a ""very disproportionate share of the burden of Unrwa's costs"",external, and that the international community should contribute more. It has also said it is unhappy that Unrwa has kept expanding the number of people eligible for assistance, and says its business model is ""simply unsustainable and has been in crisis mode for many years"". Nikki Haley has criticised Palestinian officials for ""bashing America"" This links to a wider disagreement over which Palestinians are refugees with a right to return to the homes they fled following the 1948 Arab-Israeli war. The UN says there are about five million Palestinian refugees, including the descendants of people who fled the 1948 war. However, the US and Israel disagree with how this number is calculated, and say the number of Palestinian refugees should be much smaller. President Trump also appears unhappy with how US aid to the region has been received. He has previously tweeted that the US has not received ""appreciation or respect"" for the aid it has provided, and that the Palestinians are unwilling to negotiate with Israel. US ambassador to the UN, Nikki Haley, said earlier this week: ""There's an endless number of refugees that continue to get assistance, but more importantly, the Palestinians continue to bash America."" The state department says it remains ""deeply concerned regarding the impact upon innocent Palestinians, especially school children, of the failure of Unrwa"". The organisation's chief spokesperson, Chris Gunness, told the BBC the impact of the US move would be devastating. ""It's likely to be widespread, profound, dramatic and unpredictable because, let's make no mistake, some of the most marginalised and fragile and vulnerable communities in the Middle East are going to likely suffer because of this."" Mr Gunness says 526,000 schoolchildren receive a Unrwa education every day, while it also assists ""1.7 million food insecure people"". ""We do assistance to disabled refugees, to women, to vulnerable children. The list goes on and, as I say, the impact on them is likely to be utterly devastating."" Unrwa says it is facing increased demand for its services due to a rise in Palestinian refugees Germany's foreign ministry has said it will increase contributions to Unrwa to try to maintain stability. Palestinian officials have condemned the US move. A spokesman for President Abbas told Reuters the decision was in ""defiance of UN resolutions"", and would not change the fact that the US ""no longer has a role in the region"" and ""is not a part of the solution"". The Palestinian Liberation Organization said a statement,externalthat the cut was ""a cruel and irresponsible move targeting the most vulnerable segment of Palestinian society"". The Palestinian militant group Hamas told Reuters that the move was a ""grave escalation against the Palestinian people"". Palestinian officials have already accused the US of pro-Israel bias, especially after Mr Trump recognised Jerusalem as Israel's capital and opened a US embassy in Jerusalem, despite the city being claimed by both sides. Why Trump and Jerusalem was not about peace Palestinian territories profile The move overturned decades of US neutrality on the issue and attracted international criticism. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has previously called for Unrwa's funding to be cut gradually and its responsibilities transferred to the UN's global refugee agency, the UNHCR, arguing that it ""perpetuates the Palestinian problem"". On Saturday, an official in Mr Netanyahu's office told AFP that ""Israel supports the US move"", adding: ""Consolidating the refugee status of Palestinians is one of the problems that perpetuates the conflict."" However, some Israelis have previously raised concerns that weakening Unrwa could cause regional instability and create more extremism in the region.

"Pakistan has previously rejected US accusations that it provides a safe haven for militants The US military says it is cancelling $300m (Â£230m) in aid to Pakistan over what it calls Islamabad's failure to take action against militant groups. President Donald Trump has previously accused Pakistan of deceiving the US while receiving billions of dollars. Pentagon spokesman Lt Col KonÃ© Faulkner said the US military would aim to spend the money on other ""urgent priorities"". The move, which needs to be approved by the US Congress, ispart of a broader suspension announced in January. The US state department has criticised Pakistan, a key ally, for failing to deal with terrorist networks operating on its soil, including the Haqqani network and the Afghan Taliban. ""We continue to press Pakistan to indiscriminately target all terrorist groups,"" Col Faulkner said in a statement on Saturday, adding that the $300m aid - which had earlier been suspended - should be used elsewhere due to ""a lack of Pakistani decisive actions"" in tackling the issue. The announcement comes just days before US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is due to visit Pakistan to meet the country's new prime minister, Imran Khan. In January, the US government announced it was cutting almost all security aid to the country. How will US move to cut aid affect Pakistan? US rhetoric on Pakistan raises serious questions The US and others have long complained that Pakistan provides a safe haven to militant networks, allowing them to carry out cross-border attacks in Afghanistan - something that Islamabad denies. There was no immediate comment from Pakistan on the latest funding cut. However, the military responded to January's suspension by arguing that it ""never fought for money but for peace"", and had targeted all militants at a ""heavy cost of blood and treasure"". Separately on Friday,the US said it was ending all funding for the UN's Palestinian refugee agency- the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (Unrwa) - which it described as ""irredeemably flawed"". The Haqqani network is a militant group that focuses most of its activities on neighbouring Afghanistan, which has complained for years that Pakistan allows it to operate unimpeded from its soil across the border. The group is linked to the Afghan Taliban - a hardline Islamist movement that poses a major threat to the Afghan government. Pakistani Taliban groups, while associated with the Afghan Taliban, focus on attacks within Pakistan. Will Pakistan ever stamp out extremism? Who are the Taliban? This video can not be played ANALYSIS: Will Trump's tough approach on Pakistan work? Both the Haqqani Network and the Afghan Taliban have launched attacks in Afghanistan that have killed US forces, and US officials have long argued that Pakistan, and specifically its ISI intelligence service, provides safe havens to them. Pakistan has long been accused of using the Afghan Taliban to further its foreign policy interests in the country. The ISI first became involved in funding and training militants in Afghanistan after the Soviet invasion in 1979. Pakistan and the US are key allies - but ties have frayed in recent months Although since 2001 Pakistan has allowed its territory to be used to supply international troops during the war in Afghanistan, and co-operated with the West in fighting some terrorists groups like al-Qaeda, analysts say it has continued to give shelter and support to Afghan insurgents. Its aim has been to limit the influence in Afghanistan of its chief regional rival, India. How will the US move to cut aid affect Pakistan?

"The husband of an imprisoned British-Iranian woman has spoken of her anguish at being released from jail for three days before being forced to go back. Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe was taken to a prison clinic after passing out following her return to prison in Tehran last weekend. Her husband Richardhas written to Iran's foreign minister,external, saying the whole incident had been ""a cruel game"". Middle East minister Alistair Burt is in Iran for talks about her case. What is Iran jail case about? Prisoner caught in Iran power struggle Iran's jailed dual nationals and their uncertain fate He has met Iran's deputy foreign affairs minister, Abbas Araghchi, in Tehran as well as speaking to Ms Zaghari-Ratcliffe's family. During her temporary release, she was reunited with her family including her four-year-old daughter Gabriella. Since returning to prison, she suffered several panic attacks and low blood pressure,her husband has said. She wasjailed for five years in 2016after being convicted of spying, which she denies, saying she was on holiday to introduce her daughter to relatives. Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt has promised to increase efforts to secure her release. In his open letter to Javad Zarif, Mr Ratcliffe described the week of her release and return to prison as ""a tough one"" which led her to wish she had never been allowed to leave jail, adding: ""At the end, we felt held together by Sellotape."" He described how an Iranian official had contacted his wife's father, warning him to ensure no one from the British Embassy should visit her during her temporary release ""if she wanted to stay safe"". Richard Ratcliffe has been campaigning for his wife's release ""Each day he called to note they were monitoring her movements, and check her father was following her to make sure she did not suffer an accident on the street. Those calls cast a shadow over her release, as they were meant to,"" he wrote. ""Nazanin called me on Tuesday - one of our toughest conversations. ""She wished she had never been released. She said she felt like one of the radical Islamists' captives - as though she had been paraded on the balcony then hidden back away."" The first of two panic attacks came after that phone call, he said. Mr Ratcliffe wants Mr Zarif to meet him next week at the United Nations General Assembly in New York to discuss his wife's imprisonment. Mr Burt will discuss the case of several British dual-nationals detained in Iran, as well as holding talks on the Iran nuclear deal and conflicts in Syria and Yemen, during his visit. He said, before the trip, he would ""use the opportunity of my visit to push for the resolution we all want to see in the cases of the British dual-nationals detained in Iran"".

"Matt Coker said he saw four people ""in distress"" on a dinghy about three miles off the Dover coast Four asylum seekers were rescued by a fishing boat when their dinghy got into trouble off the Kent coast. The fishing vessel's captain Matt Coker, 37, said he came to the asylum seekers' aid about three miles from Dover on Saturday. They had tied a red T-shirt to an oar to attract attention, Mr Coker said. A Home Office spokesman confirmed four people had been taken to Dover and ""will be processed in line with the immigration rules"". Mr Coker, skipper of The Royal Charlotte, said he spotted three men and one woman ""in distress"" on the dinghy at about 10:30 BST. His fishing party approached the smaller craft, pulled the four people on board and administered first aid before calling the Coastguard. Mr Coker said: ""As I got over to them I could see they were clearly in distress and the boat was half full of water, so they sort of made a leap for the boat as we got near."" He added: ""They didn't speak any English but they kept saying 'Iran' because I was asking where they had come from and if they were OK.""

"Amsterdam Central Station is used by an estimated 250,000 travellers every day An Afghan man accused of injuring two people in a stabbing at Amsterdam's central railway station on Friday had a terrorist motive, officials say. The man, who has been named in Dutch media as Jawed S, was shot and wounded by police during the incident. Earlier the US ambassador said the two victims were American tourists. ""We are aware that both victims were US citizens and have been in touch with them and their families,"" Pete Hoekstra said in a statement on Saturday. The authorities said: ""Following an initial statement it has emerged the man had a terrorist motive."" German police have conducted a search of the suspect's home in Germany. A police spokesman quoted by Agence France-Presse said the arrested Afghan man did not know the victims and had not singled them out specifically as targets. The attacker and victims were all taken to hospital for treatment. Some train services in and out of the station were suspended during the incident and two platforms closed.

"A record 3.3 million visits were made to sexual health clinics in England last year, as local councils warn over funding cuts and stretched resources. Figures show there were 3,323,275 visits across the country in 2017, an increase of 13% from 2013. The extra demand comes at the same time as Â£600m has been cut from public health spending. The Local Government Association (LGA) is urging the government to reverse the budget cuts. The LGA, which represents 370 councils in England and Wales, welcomed the increase in people taking their sexual health seriously but said it would be ""hugely challenging"" to maintain services at current levels. It also warned that some areas may struggle to respond to unforeseensexually transmitted infection (STI),externaloutbreaks unless cuts were halted. The total number of sexual health screens - tests for chlamydia, gonorrhoea, syphilis and HIV - has risen by nearly one-fifth (18%) from 1,513,288 in 2013 to 1,778,306 in 2017, figures from Public Health England revealed. A BBC investigation in Junerevealed that almost half the councils in England were planning to cut spending on sexual health, putting some sexual health clinics at risk of closure or reduced hours as a result. Of the 151 councils that responded to a BBC Freedom of Information request, 72 planned to cut sexual health funding in 2018-19 compared with 2017-18. Most said any savings would be made through efficiencies, but 16 councils said services would be cut or reduced. Councillor Ian Hudspeth, chairman of the LGA's Community Wellbeing Board, said some councils' sexual health services are being pushed to unsustainable levels. He said: ""While it's great to see a huge increase in people taking their sexual health seriously, this rising demand is pushing some councils' sexual health services to peak capacity levels which are not sustainable in the long term. ""Cuts to public health funding need to be reversed as this could affect councils' ability to meet further increases in demand and respond to unforeseen outbreaks of sexually transmitted infections."" Dr Olwen Williams, president of the British Association for Sexual Health and HIV said: ""Cuts to sexual health funding have come at the worst possible time. ""Record demand for services, dramatic increases in syphilis and gonorrhoea diagnoses and the spread of treatment-resistant infection in recent years mean that many services are struggling to cope, despite valiant efforts from staff."" The government is being urged to reverse public health budget cuts He said further cuts would ""almost certainly tip them over the edge"" and urged the government to reverse its ""damaging approach to sexual health"". A Department of Health and Social Care spokesman said: ""We have a strong track record on sexual health with teenage pregnancies at an all-time low and sexually-transmitted infections continuing to fall. ""Sexual health services and tests are now more widely available online which means people can get tested at a time that suits them - over 11,000 diagnoses from online tests were reported last year."" The spokesman said the government was giving Â£16bn to local authorities for public health services over the current spending period.

"Alex Salmond launched the appeal for Â£50,000 to pay for legal action against the Scottish government Alex Salmond's crowdfunding appeal to pay for his legal action against the Scottish government has closed after raising double its Â£50,000 target. The former first minister is seeking a judicial review of the government's handling of sexual misconduct complaints against him. Mr Salmond strongly denies the allegations, describing them as ""patently ridiculous"". His fundraiser has been heavily criticised by opposition parties. They have raised concerns that the high-profile crowdfunding campaign could make women less likely to come forward with sexual harassment complaints against other powerful men in the future. Brian Taylor: SNP in turmoil, but not civil war Salmond allegations: What do we know? How the Salmond story has played out online The appeal, which was closed on Saturday, raised Â£100,007 in total. Mr Salmond thanked all of those who had contributed and said: ""The petition for judicial review has now been served and all of you helped make that possible. ""We have now closed the fund with double the amount aimed for raised in double quick time. ""Every penny of surplus funds, which will be substantial in the event of a successful judicial review, will be distributed to good causes in Scotland and beyond."" The complaints against Mr Salmond relate to allegations about his conduct towards two staff members in 2013, while he was first minister. Mr Salmond, who led the Scottish government between 2007 and 2014, launched his crowdfunder on Wednesday evening as he announced he was quitting the SNP to focus on clearing his name. He said he was doing so because he feared there would be ""substantial internal division"" within the party if his successor Nicola Sturgeon was forced to suspend him, and has stressed that he intends to rejoin the party after clearing his name. The crowdfunder reached its Â£50,000 target within a few hours of its launch, and passed the Â£100,000 mark on Saturday - with more than 4,000 people contributing to it. Many of those who left messages on the crowdfunding page said they donated as they believed Mr Salmond was innocent, with some saying they believed he had been targeted because of his support for independence. However, a Scottish Conservative party spokesman described the appeal as ""crass"". He added: ""Alex Salmond should never have been squeezing cash out of SNP supporters in the first place. ""His legal action has nothing to do with independence, yet he used the cause to convince the party faithful to cough up. ""It was crass and certainly not becoming of a former first minister of Scotland."" Mr Salmond has said that ""all sums received will contribute exclusively to progressing the judicial review and any money left over will be used to support good causes in Scotland and beyond."" He claims that new Scottish government procedures for investigating harassment complaints against current and former ministers were unfair and unlawful, and has asked the Court of Session to examine them. Alex Salmond is seeking a judicial review at the Court of Session in Edinburgh Ms Sturgeon, the current first minister, has staunchly defended the Scottish government's investigation into the two complaints that were made against Mr Salmond, telling BBC Scotland on Wednesday thatthe rules also had to be fair to the women making the allegations. She also said she wants a culture where people were able to come forward with complaints regardless of ""how senior, how powerful, how well-known or what the political allegiance is"" of the person involved. Spent much of today chatting to sundry folk within the SNP and the wider independence movement. I was struck by the plaintive, woebegone nature of the exchanges - or most of them. Struck but not remotely surprised. In the short term, it is hard to see the events of the past week as anything other than deeply damaging for the SNP. None was prepared to deploy the term ""civil war"" about the party's current travails. I think I can understand why. Strictly, a political civil war would involve two or more distinct factions, with evident leaders and an ideological distinction. This is different. This is turmoil, confusion, disquiet. One source described an ordinary SNP branch meeting this week. Folk were unsure, uncertain what to say or do. I suspect that is more typical than the zealous certainty one occasionally encounters on social media, which prompted the ""civil war"" description in the first place. Still, it matters little. Turmoil can be just as undermining, just as sapping of confidence as outright political conflict. Indeed, it can be worse. Uncertainty breeds disquiet and can demoralise, if unchecked.

A statement from his solicitors, Levy & McRae, said: ""We can also confirm that first respondent is the Permanent Secretary, Ms Leslie Evans, who established the procedure which is the subject of challenge. ""The second respondent is the Scottish government."" Ms Evans, who is the Scottish government's most senior civil servant, was asked by Ms Sturgeon last year to carry out a review of the government's existing harassment procedures in the wake of concerns about the potential scale of the problem at Holyrood, Westminster and beyond.

"Alex Salmond launched the appeal for Â£50,000 to pay for legal action against the Scottish government Alex Salmond's crowdfunding appeal to pay for his legal action against the Scottish government has closed after raising double its Â£50,000 target. The former first minister is seeking a judicial review of the government's handling of sexual misconduct complaints against him. Mr Salmond strongly denies the allegations, describing them as ""patently ridiculous"". His fundraiser has been heavily criticised by opposition parties. They have raised concerns that the high-profile crowdfunding campaign could make women less likely to come forward with sexual harassment complaints against other powerful men in the future. Brian Taylor: SNP in turmoil, but not civil war Salmond allegations: What do we know? How the Salmond story has played out online The appeal, which was closed on Saturday, raised Â£100,007 in total. Mr Salmond thanked all of those who had contributed and said: ""The petition for judicial review has now been served and all of you helped make that possible. ""We have now closed the fund with double the amount aimed for raised in double quick time. ""Every penny of surplus funds, which will be substantial in the event of a successful judicial review, will be distributed to good causes in Scotland and beyond."" The complaints against Mr Salmond relate to allegations about his conduct towards two staff members in 2013, while he was first minister. Mr Salmond, who led the Scottish government between 2007 and 2014, launched his crowdfunder on Wednesday evening as he announced he was quitting the SNP to focus on clearing his name.

"This video can not be played John McCain's daughter Meghan paid an emotional tribute to her father Ex-presidents Barack Obama and George W Bush have paid tribute to Senator John McCain at a memorial service at Washington's National Cathedral. The Vietnam War hero, who became one of America's most high-profile politicians, died a week ago from brain cancer at the age of 81. His daughter Meghan was the first to speak, paying an emotional tribute to her father while also criticising President Donald Trump's agenda. Mr Trump did not attend the service. The two Republicans had major differences, both personal and political, and Mr McCain's family made it clear that Mr Trump was not welcome. Members of the Trump administration who were present included the president's daughter Ivanka and son-in-law Jared Kushner. Obituary: John McCain Why McCain picked these 15 pallbearers Washington pays homage In pictures: John McCain memorial service Following memorial services in the state of Arizona - which Mr McCain represented as a senator, and where he died last Saturday - and in Washington, a private burial service will be held at the US Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, on Sunday. On Friday Mr McCain's body was taken back to the Congress buildings where he worked for decades and lay in state in the Capitol rotunda overnight. On the way from the Capitol to the cathedral on Saturday morning, the cortege stopped at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, where his widow Cindy laid a wreath. Meghan McCain told mourners at the cathedral: ""We gather here to mourn the passing of American greatness. ""The real thing, not cheap rhetoric from men who will never come near the sacrifice he gave so willingly, nor the opportunistic appropriation of those who live lives of comfort and privilege while he suffered and served. ""The America of John McCain is generous and welcoming and bold, she is resourceful and confident and secure, she meets her responsibilities, she speaks quietly because she is strong. ""America does not boast, because she does not need to. The America of John McCain has no need to be made great again, because America was always great."" A military honour guard and the McCain family accompanied the casket out of the memorial service Former President Obama paid tribute to the man he defeated in the 2008 US presidential election. He described Mr McCain as an ""extraordinary man - a warrior, a statesman, a patriot"" who embodied much of what made America great. Mr Obama said that, despite their many differences, ""we never doubted we were on the same team"". He added: ""John understood that our security and our influence was won not just by our military might, not just by our wealth, not just by our ability to bend others to our will, but from our capacity to inspire others with our adherence to a set of universal values - like rule of law and human rights - and an insistence on the God-given dignity of every human being."" Mr Bush - who defeated Mr McCain for the Republican presidential nomination in 2000 - paid tribute to the senator's courage, honesty and sense of honour. ""At various points during his long career, John confronted polices and practices that he believed were unworthy of his country. To the face of those in authority, John McCain would insist: 'We are better than this, America is better than this.' ""John would be the first to tell you he was not a perfect man, but he dedicated his life to national ideals that are as perfect as men and women have as yet conceived."" Other speakers included former Senator Joe Lieberman and former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, 95. Before he went into politics, Mr McCain was a US Navy pilot who was shot down over Hanoi while on a bombing mission in 1967. He was held as a prisoner until 1973, enduring torture that - along with the injuries he sustained bailing out of his jet - left him with life-long injuries. The key moments in McCain's life The angry politics of McCain's death Five times McCain clashed with Trump While deeply conservative on some issues, the Arizona senator had a maverick streak that endeared him to political friends and opponents. This video can not be played John McCain: US war hero, maverick and political titan He championed reform of US immigration, campaign finance and environmental laws, and was outspoken in criticising those who advocated what he considered torture against captured enemies of the US. The pallbearers he chose reflected his desire to reach across political divides. They included Hollywood actor and liberal political activist Warren Beatty; former independent New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg; liberal former Senator Russ Feingold, who drew up campaign finance reform legislation with McCain; and Russian opposition politician Vladimir Kara Murza.

"One of the bittersweet benefits of knowing one's life is coming to an end is the ability to make plans for how one will be memorialised. Senator John McCain reportedly took to the task with his trademark gusto, holding weekly meetings to arrange the details of his funeral and accompanying events. ""By the time he died on Saturday, Mr McCain had carefully stage-managed a four-day celebration of his life - but what was also an unmistakable rebuke to President Trump and his agenda,"" write Mike Shear and Katie Rogersin the New York Times.,external This included reaching out to those McCain wanted as pallbearers - a process he started in April. A total of 14 men and one woman will accompany the late senator's coffin into the National Cathedral in Washington DC on Saturday. The officially released list - which identifies them all as ""friends"" before offering further details - is fraught with meaning. John McCain and Warren Beatty bonded over campaign finance reform Why on earth did McCain pickWarren Beatty, long a fixture among the liberal Hollywood elite, for this place of honour? It turns out the two had a friendship dating back to the 1990s. While they differed on many political subjects, the Oscar-winning Hollywood actor and the Arizona senator viewed campaign finance reform that would limit the corrupting influence of money on politics as a top policy priority. ""I've known John McCain for a long time,"" Beatty said in a 2008 interview with the Atlantic. ""He is a conservative. ""I think I've made it clear that I'm a liberal Democrat,"" Beatty continued. ""I don't think that political ideology is necessarily germane to friendships."" Like McCain, Vladimir Kara-Murza has been an outspoken critic of Vladimir Putin's regime It's been billed asMcCain's ""final dig"",externalat Russian President Vladimir Putin - and Donald Trump. By selecting Russian opposition politicianVladimir Kara-Murza, McCain re-emphasised his repeated criticisms of the Putin regime and what he viewed as Mr Trump's too-cosy attitude toward it. McCain and Kara-Murza's friendship dates back to 2010 and the Arizona senator's support of Russian pro-democracy demonstrations. The two would later co-operate in marshalling support in Congress for Russian sanctions measures. Kara-Murza has twice been the target of apparent poison-based assassination attempts, the most recent, in February 2017, left him in a coma. ""Much has and will be written about McCain's military courage, his patriotism, his famed bipartisanship and his unimpeachable personal decency,"" Kara-Murza writes in a Washington Post tribute to the senator. ""His long-standing position on Russia deserves a special tribute."" Two ex-presidents, Democrat Barack Obama and Republican George W Bush, will deliver eulogies for McCain, and the cast of officeholders among his pallbearers reinforces the bipartisan theme. Vice-PresidentJoe Biden, a former Senate colleague, will also give a eulogy for McCain at services in Phoenix. Another Democrat, former SenatorRuss Feingold, co-sponsored McCain's signature legislative achievement, the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 - which the two passed over the determined opposition of the chamber's Republican leadership. There are also several politicians who blurred traditional party lines - Republican-turned-independent former New York City MayorMichael BloombergandWilliam Cohen, a Republican senator who served in as secretary of defence in the Clinton administration. Like McCain, former SenatorGary Hartof Colorado once ran his own nearly successful insurgent presidential primary campaign, against Democrat Walter Mondale in 1984. SenatorSheldon Whitehouseof Rhode Island (the only current office-holder), former Texas SenatorPhil Grammand former Secretary of Homeland SecurityTom Ridgeround out the group. Rick Davis, who ran McCain's two presidential campaigns, reads the senator's last message to the American people As with many politicians - at least, the good ones - McCain had a retinue of loyal aides and staffers who stuck with him for years.Mark Salter, McCain's former senate chief of staff, was also his top speechwriter and muse, co-writing seven books, including the 1999 best-seller about his family's military legacy and his time as a prisoner of war, Faith of My Fathers. Rick Davis, who took centre stage earlier this week when he read McCain's final words to the nation, served as the senator's campaign manager for both his 2000 and 2008 presidential bids. Federal Express founder Fred Smith was the co-chair of McCain's 2008 presidential campaign As McCain knew as well as any public official, money is the fuel that powers a career in politics. He made campaign finance reform one of his life-long efforts, and perhaps his most prominent legislative achievements. Lofty principles, however, don't pay the campaign bills. Among the lesser-known pallbearers on Saturday are the people McCain relied on to bankroll his political ambitions. Fred Smith, founder of global delivery company Federal Express, served as national co-chair of McCain's 2008 presidential bid.Carla Eudy, a family friend and the only woman among the pallbearers, was McCain's 2008 national finance director and headed a McCain-affiliated political action committee. Rounding out the list is California communications executiveStephen Dart, along-time Republican donor,externalwho also served as a fund-raiser for McCain's 2008 campaign.

Mr Obama said that, despite their many differences, ""we never doubted we were on the same team"". He added: ""John understood that our security and our influence was won not just by our military might, not just by our wealth, not just by our ability to bend others to our will, but from our capacity to inspire others with our adherence to a set of universal values - like rule of law and human rights - and an insistence on the God-given dignity of every human being."" Mr Bush - who defeated Mr McCain for the Republican presidential nomination in 2000 - paid tribute to the senator's courage, honesty and sense of honour. ""At various points during his long career, John confronted polices and practices that he believed were unworthy of his country. To the face of those in authority, John McCain would insist: 'We are better than this, America is better than this.' ""John would be the first to tell you he was not a perfect man, but he dedicated his life to national ideals that are as perfect as men and women have as yet conceived."" Other speakers included former Senator Joe Lieberman and former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, 95. Before he went into politics, Mr McCain was a US Navy pilot who was shot down over Hanoi while on a bombing mission in 1967. He was held as a prisoner until 1973, enduring torture that - along with the injuries he sustained bailing out of his jet - left him with life-long injuries. The key moments in McCain's life The angry politics of McCain's death Five times McCain clashed with Trump While deeply conservative on some issues, the Arizona senator had a maverick streak that endeared him to political friends and opponents. This video can not be played John McCain: US war hero, maverick and political titan He championed reform of US immigration, campaign finance and environmental laws, and was outspoken in criticising those who advocated what he considered torture against captured enemies of the US. The pallbearers he chose reflected his desire to reach across political divides. They included Hollywood actor and liberal political activist Warren Beatty; former independent New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg; liberal former Senator Russ Feingold, who drew up campaign finance reform legislation with McCain; and Russian opposition politician Vladimir Kara Murza.

"At least 40 children were among 51 people killed in the 9 August strike The Saudi-led coalition in Yemen has expressed regret over ""mistakes"" made in a deadly air strike on a bus. More than 40 children were killed in the strike in a market in northern Saada province on 9 August, drawing international condemnation. In a statement on Saturday, the coalition pledged to hold those responsible for the strike accountable. But a spokesman for the coalition's own investigation maintained that the strike had targeted a Houthi leader. Ending Yemenâs never-ending war Yemen crisis: Who is fighting whom? The head of the coalition's Joint Incidents Assessment Team (JIAT), Lt Gen Mansour al-Mansour, said its investigation had found that the bus was carrying Houthi leaders and fighters and was therefore a ""legitimate"" military target, but admitted that the location of the strike had led to collateral damage. A statement carried by the Saudi state news agency SPA on Saturday said: ""The Joint Forces Command of the Coalition expresses regret over the mistakes, extends its sympathies, condolences and solidarity to the families of the victims."" The coalition said it would co-ordinate with the Yemeni government to compensate families of victims and would also review its rules of engagement. The coalition insists it never deliberately targets civilians, but human rights groups have accused it of bombing markets, schools, hospitals and residential areas. This video can not be played Aftermath of an attack that shocked the world Earlier this week,the coalition rejected the findings of a UN reportwhich said that war crimes may have been committed by all parties in the conflict. UN experts accused Yemeni government forces, the coalition backing them, and the rebel Houthi movement of making little effort to minimise civilian casualties. Last week,another strike to the south of the port city of Hudaydah killed at least 22 children and four women. Yemen has been devastated by a conflict that escalated in early 2015, when the Houthis seized control of much of the west of the country and forced President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi to flee abroad. Alarmed by the rise of a group they saw as an Iranian proxy, the UAE, Saudi Arabia and seven other Arab states intervened in an attempt to restore the government. Almost 10,000 people - two-thirds of them civilians - have been killed and 55,000 others injured in the fighting, according to the United Nations. The fighting and a partial blockade by the coalition has also left 22 million people in need of humanitarian aid, created the world's largest food security emergency, and led to a cholera outbreak that is thought to have affected a million people.

"HM Revenue and Customs' reported policy of advising against giving honours to tax-avoiding celebrities has been backed by Sir Vince Cable. Celebrities who use lawful but controversial schemes are being ""blacklisted"" to protect the reputation of the honours list, saysthe Times,external. A Freedom of Information request showed a traffic light system was used to identify an individual's suitability. The Liberal Democrat leader said HMRC's tough stance was perfectly reasonable. Birthday Honours: Twelve famous faces Guide to the Honours ""The principle is right, I think the public is fed up with abusive tax avoidance by individuals and companies,"" Sir Vince told the BBC. He said: ""It seems perfectly reasonable to me that the Inland Revenue should be taking a tough line on tax avoidance."" Sir Vince, a former business secretary, added that some celebrities may ""wonder why they've been caught up in it"" as they may be unaware they have been involved in ""aggressive tax avoidance"" because accountants handle their affairs. HMRC analyses nominees for honours to check the risk of them being exposed over their tax affairs. The FOI response revealed that people are categorised as green if they are low risk, amber for medium risk and red for high risk. David Beckham is one of a number of celebrities who invested in a tax avoidance scheme which was successfully challenged by HMRC The list is then sent back to the Cabinet Office honours committee and the prime minister via secure email. An amber rating - given to individuals whose tax affairs would be ""likely to cause adverse comment"" - would damage their chance of receiving an honour, said the Times. It added that the system was a ""rare exception to the principle of taxpayer confidentiality"". A government spokesman said it was a ""longstanding policy... to protect the integrity of the system"". Last year, leaked emails appeared to reveal David Beckham's frustration at missing out on a knighthood in 2013. The 43-year-old was one of a number of celebrities who invested in a tax avoidance scheme which wassuccessfully challenged by HMRC. It is not known whether he was among the celebrities blocked by HMRC from receiving an honour as the Times describes. British honours are awarded on merit, for exceptional achievement or service. The honours list, announced twice a year, consists of knights and dames, appointments to the Order of the British Empire and gallantry awards to servicemen and women, and civilians. Anybody can nominate someone,externalliving in the UK that he or she judges to be deserving of an honour - but must provide a detailed explanation and submit two supporting letters. Whether someone gets an honour - and at what level - is decided by a committee specialising in that field (eg sport, business, education etc) which sends its recommendations to the main honours committee, and then on to the prime minister and the Queen. Read more here A document seen by the Times - which sets out the agreement between the Cabinet Office and HMRC - said that ""poor tax behaviour is not consistent with the award of an honour"". It continued: ""Trust would likely be lost if an honour was awarded to someone with negative tax behaviours and those behaviours became linked to the positive recognition that accompanies the award of an honour."" A government spokeswoman said: ""Honours are given to reward outstanding service in a given field or area and each nomination is rigorously assessed. ""As a matter of longstanding policy, in order to protect the integrity of the system, government departments which may have an interest in a particular nomination - including HMRC - are invited to contribute their views during this process."" Nominees who are approved for honours meet the Queen or another senior member of the Royal Family at an investiture ceremony This arrangement with HMRCwas already highlighted on the gov.uk website,externalwhen the Times put in an Freedom of Information request to the government in January to seek more details. Its question, submitted just after the publication of the New Year's Honours list, asked: ""What rules and/or guidance are there in the honours system regarding the awarding of honours to people with criminal convictions and/or other potential flaws in their character, such as cheating at sport, drug taking, offensive behaviour?"" The Cabinet Office refused to give the paper the information and argued releasing vetting agreements with HMRC and the police could hinder the system. Sir Vince said it was ""reprehensible"" that the government had resisted releasing the documents. He said he was ""surprised and disappointed"" by the government's actions, which showed ""it isn't too keen on transparency and that is clearly wrong"". After appealing to the Information Commissioner's Office, the Times was eventually given the documents. The Cabinet Office has, however, refused to give copies of letters and forms sent to lord lieutenants - the Queen's representative in each county - who also take part in the vetting process when someone from their area is nominated. Honours expert Richard Fitzwilliam said celebrities who may have been blacklisted over tax avoidance still deserved to be honoured for excelling in their particular fields as well as their charity work. ""No-one is condoning tax avoidance,"" the former editor of International Who's Who told the BBC. He said: ""There's nothing unlawful apparently in what has happened, clearly the honours system ought to take this into account.""

"Matt Coker said he saw four people ""in distress"" on a dinghy about three miles off the Dover coast Four asylum seekers were rescued by a fishing boat when their dinghy got into trouble off the Kent coast. The fishing vessel's captain Matt Coker, 37, said he came to the asylum seekers' aid about three miles from Dover on Saturday. They had tied a red T-shirt to an oar to attract attention, Mr Coker said. A Home Office spokesman confirmed four people had been taken to Dover and ""will be processed in line with the immigration rules"". Mr Coker, skipper of The Royal Charlotte, said he spotted three men and one woman ""in distress"" on the dinghy at about 10:30 BST. His fishing party approached the smaller craft, pulled the four people on board and administered first aid before calling the Coastguard. Mr Coker said: ""As I got over to them I could see they were clearly in distress and the boat was half full of water, so they sort of made a leap for the boat as we got near."" He added: ""They didn't speak any English but they kept saying 'Iran' because I was asking where they had come from and if they were OK.""

"This video can not be played 'Anti-Khan' bikini balloon launches A giant balloon of a bikini-clad Sadiq Khan has been flown in London as part of a campaign to oust the capital's mayor. Campaigners raised Â£58,182 for the 29ft-long blimp, which was launched in Parliament Square earlier. Mr Khan said people were ""welcome"" to look at the balloon but he did not think the swimwear suited him. Organiser Yanny Bruere has denied claims he is affiliated with any right-wing groups. His anti-Khan crowdfunding campaign was launched following theDonald Trump baby balloon flown by protestersduring the president's visit in July. The giant inflatable of the mayor - a nod to the""Beach Body Ready"" advert Mr Khan voiced his disapproval for in 2016- was approved by City Hall, the police and air traffic controllers NATS. Campaigners flew the 29ft-long blimp in Parliament Square The fundraising page for the balloon said: ""In light of the Donald Trump 'Baby Trump' balloon being allowed to fly over London during his visit to the UK, let's get a 'baby Khan' one and see if free speech applies to all. ""Under Sadiq Khan, we have seen crime skyrocket to unprecedented levels. People in London don't feel safe [...] Khan out."" Mr Khan said: ""If people want to spend their Saturday looking at me in a yellow bikini they're welcome to do so. ""I don't really think yellow's my colour though."" Mr Bruere said any extra funds donated to the campaign would be used to arrange for the balloon to tour the UK. Sadiq Khan said he did not think yellow was his colour ""It's been a great effort by everyone,"" he added. ""Families, children, young people, old people, it's been a real collection of different demographics come together."" But Mr Bruere also expressed concern about the response to his stunt in comparison with ""Baby Trump"". Yanny Bruere said he felt he had been subject to more public criticism than those who brought ""Baby Trump"" to the same spot ""With this campaign, I've been called far-right, and Nazi, and all this kind of thing,"" he said. ""None of it's true, obviously,"" he added. ""But it's just funny that the people who organised the Trump one were kind of widely praised and heralded for what they were doing.

"Kim Jong-nam, pictured in 2001, the late half-brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un Malaysian police are seeking two Indonesian women they want to testify at the trial of those accused of killing Kim Jong-nam, the half-brother of North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un. Local media named the potential witnesses as Raisa Rinda Salma, 24, and Dessy Meyrisinta, 33. Kim Jong-nam died at Kuala Lumpur airport in February 2017, after toxic VX nerve agent was rubbed on his face. Two women are being tried for his murder. They are Siti Aisyah from Indonesia and Doan Thi Houng from Vietnam. Both have pleaded not guilty, saying they thought they were carrying out a prank for a reality TV show, and did not know the colourless, odourless VX was harmful. Police have urged anyone who knows the two new named witnesses to contact Sepang district police. Doan Thi Huong (left) and Siti Aisyah (right) say they were tricked by North Korean agents into carrying out the killing Defence lawyers say the two women accused of murder had been paid to take part in similar tricks at airports, hotels and shopping malls in the days before Kim's death. Who was Kim Jong-nam? The women accused of killing Kim Jong-nam Kim Jong-nam death: Unravelling the mystery A lawyer representing Siti Aisyah previously told a court in Malaysia that she had been paid 4,000 Malaysian ringgit (Â£730, $1,020) by a North Korean to fly to Macau, where Kim was reportedly living in self-imposed exile. The two women face death by hanging if they are found guilty. This video can not be played The BBC's Rupert Wingfield-Hayes retraces Kim Jong-nam's last steps Pyongyang has denied any involvement in the murder, but four men - believed to be North Koreans who fled Malaysia on the day of the killing - have also been charged in the case. They remain at large despite an Interpol ""red notice"", equivalent to an international arrest warrant. Kim Jong-nam was largely estranged from his family, after being bypassed as heir to the North Korean leadership in favour of his younger half-brother. He spent most of his time overseas in Macau, mainland China and Singapore. He had spoken out in the past against his family's dynastic control of North Korea and in a 2012 book was quoted as saying he believed his half-brother lacked leadership qualities.

"The plane's left engine caught fire after the aircraft left the runway A passenger jet skidded off the runway and caught fire while landing in the Russian city of Sochi, injuring 18 people, officials have said. Flight UT579, a Boeing 737-800 operated by the Utair airline, was carrying 164 passengers and six crew from Moscow.

"Amsterdam Central Station is used by an estimated 250,000 travellers every day An Afghan man accused of injuring two people in a stabbing at Amsterdam's central railway station on Friday had a terrorist motive, officials say. The man, who has been named in Dutch media as Jawed S, was shot and wounded by police during the incident. Earlier the US ambassador said the two victims were American tourists. ""We are aware that both victims were US citizens and have been in touch with them and their families,"" Pete Hoekstra said in a statement on Saturday. The authorities said: ""Following an initial statement it has emerged the man had a terrorist motive."" German police have conducted a search of the suspect's home in Germany. A police spokesman quoted by Agence France-Presse said the arrested Afghan man did not know the victims and had not singled them out specifically as targets. The attacker and victims were all taken to hospital for treatment. Some train services in and out of the station were suspended during the incident and two platforms closed.

"Lord Blunkett, a Labour member for 55 years, says Mr Field's decision should prompt change in the party Former Home Secretary Lord Blunkett has said the resignation of veteran Labour MP Frank Field must be seen as a ""catalyst for seismic change"". Writing in the Daily Telegraph,external, Lord Blunkett called for a rethink of the ""so-called Corbyn project"". Mr Field quit the Labour group at Westminster over the party's handling of anti-Semitism allegations and what he called a ""culture of nastiness"". His critics say he quit because he was facing deselection by local members. Lord Blunkett said Mr Field's decision indicated a ""deeper malaise"" within the party. He wrote: ""The commitment to Labour as a 'broad church', which motivated some of those who nominated Jeremy [Corbyn], has been thrown back in their faces and demonstrated that the so-called 'new style of politics' is anything but."" He added that Labour must put its ""own house in order as decisively and speedily as possible"". ""Either Jeremy Corbyn can lead a party into gradual decline and irrelevance, or demonstrate that he can lead a party fit for government. The choice is his."" Analysis: Field is not leading a Labour breakaway Profile: Who is Frank Field? A guide to Labour Party anti-Semitism claims Meanwhile Ivor Caplin, a former defence minister who chairs Labour's Jewish affiliate, said he regretted Mr Field's departure and warned Labour would lose its chance to form the next government unless the anti-Semitism crisis was dealt with. ""It's been depressing for members of the Jewish community - but not just for us - for members of the public as well, because they want to see the Labour Party as an effective opposition to this shambolic Tory government, and particularly on Brexit, the NHS, schools,""he told the Guardian.,external He added that he had never considered leaving the party himself but the ""constant aggressive nature of some people"" in the party was wearing on activists and ""that is not right"". Mr Field, MP for Birkenhead for almost 40 years, resigned the Labour whip on Thursday, blaming a ""culture of intolerance, nastiness and intimidation"" in local Labour parties. He told the BBC it was ""sad"" how the party had been taken over by the hard left since Mr Corbyn's election. ""The campaign that Jewish people feel against them by factions of the Labour Party is all part of the intolerance which we also see at a local level,"" he added. Mr Field, a former minister for welfare reform, said he wanted to remain a party member and sit as an ""independent Labour"" MP. But Labour said resigning the whip meant quitting the party. Mr Field later told the Press Association he would legally challenge any move to remove him from the party, adding that the saga was ""one of the saddest"" in his long career. This video can not be played Frank Field says Labour should be a 'champion against racism' Mr Field, who retained his Merseyside seat at the 2017 general election with a majority of 25,514, said he was considering whether to stand down as an MP and trigger a by-election, in which he would stand against an official Labour candidate. His critics say Mr Field quit because he was facing deselection by local members. He recently lost a vote of confidence organised by members angry at his support for the government in Brexit votes. A Labour source said: ""Frank has been looking for an excuse to resign for some time."" The party's deputy leader Tom Watson described Mr Field's resignation as a ""serious loss to the party"" and a ""major wake up call"". Earlier this month, Mr Corbyn apologised again for hurt caused to Jewish people by anti-Semitism in his party and admitted Labour had been too slow in dealing with disciplinary cases.

"This video can not be played John McCain's daughter Meghan paid an emotional tribute to her father Ex-presidents Barack Obama and George W Bush have paid tribute to Senator John McCain at a memorial service at Washington's National Cathedral. The Vietnam War hero, who became one of America's most high-profile politicians, died a week ago from brain cancer at the age of 81. His daughter Meghan was the first to speak, paying an emotional tribute to her father while also criticising President Donald Trump's agenda. Mr Trump did not attend the service. The two Republicans had major differences, both personal and political, and Mr McCain's family made it clear that Mr Trump was not welcome. Members of the Trump administration who were present included the president's daughter Ivanka and son-in-law Jared Kushner.

On Friday Mr McCain's body was taken back to the Congress buildings where he worked for decades and lay in state in the Capitol rotunda overnight. On the way from the Capitol to the cathedral on Saturday morning, the cortege stopped at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, where his widow Cindy laid a wreath. Meghan McCain told mourners at the cathedral: ""We gather here to mourn the passing of American greatness. ""The real thing, not cheap rhetoric from men who will never come near the sacrifice he gave so willingly, nor the opportunistic appropriation of those who live lives of comfort and privilege while he suffered and served. ""The America of John McCain is generous and welcoming and bold, she is resourceful and confident and secure, she meets her responsibilities, she speaks quietly because she is strong. ""America does not boast, because she does not need to. The America of John McCain has no need to be made great again, because America was always great."" A military honour guard and the McCain family accompanied the casket out of the memorial service Former President Obama paid tribute to the man he defeated in the 2008 US presidential election. He described Mr McCain as an ""extraordinary man - a warrior, a statesman, a patriot"" who embodied much of what made America great. Mr Obama said that, despite their many differences, ""we never doubted we were on the same team"". He added: ""John understood that our security and our influence was won not just by our military might, not just by our wealth, not just by our ability to bend others to our will, but from our capacity to inspire others with our adherence to a set of universal values - like rule of law and human rights - and an insistence on the God-given dignity of every human being."" Mr Bush - who defeated Mr McCain for the Republican presidential nomination in 2000 - paid tribute to the senator's courage, honesty and sense of honour. ""At various points during his long career, John confronted polices and practices that he believed were unworthy of his country. To the face of those in authority, John McCain would insist: 'We are better than this, America is better than this.' ""John would be the first to tell you he was not a perfect man, but he dedicated his life to national ideals that are as perfect as men and women have as yet conceived."" Other speakers included former Senator Joe Lieberman and former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, 95. Before he went into politics, Mr McCain was a US Navy pilot who was shot down over Hanoi while on a bombing mission in 1967.

"The Palestinian population is divided between historic Palestine and a diaspora, mainly in neighbouring Arab countries. Efforts to create a Palestinian state on the West Bank of the River Jordan and Gaza on the Mediterranean coast have been frustrated by the continuing conflict with Israel. Palestinians in the West Bank and eastern Jerusalem have lived under Israeli occupation since 1967, while the settlements Israel has built in the West Bank are home to 500,000 people and are deemed to be illegal under international law, although Israel disputes this. There are also disputes over the status of diaspora Palestinians and the question of whether Palestinian refugees should be allowed to return to lands they were displaced from in what is now Israel. Palestinians have been striving for self-determination but have achieved only limited control over their affairs. Relations with the Israeli authorities have been marked by violent conflict. The economy is fragmented and subject to Israeli restrictions. Much of the population is dependent on food aid. The Palestinian political leadership is deeply divided between Mahmoud Abbas'Fatahparty in the West Bank and its Islamist militantHamasopponents who control the Gaza Strip. Israel has occupied East Jerusalem since the1967 Six-Day Warand regards the entire city its capital, though this is not recognised by the vast majority of the international community. Palestinians claim it as the capital of a future hoped-for state. The UN Security Council and other international bodies argue that peace between Israelis and Palestinians depends on the ""two-state solution"", the idea that establishing an independent Palestine alongside Israel would create a way for the two sides to co-exist peacefully. However,little progress has been made recently. Read morecountry profiles,external- Profiles byBBC Monitoring,external Capital:Jerusalem (proclaimed, limited international recognition) Administrative centre:Ramallah Area:6,020 sq km Population:5.3 million (West Bank: 3.19 million; Gaza Strip: 2.17 million) 5.9 million refugees (in surrounding countries and elsewhere:UNRWRA,external) Language:Arabic Life expectancy:72 years (men) 77 years (women) President: Mahmoud Abbas Mahmoud Abbas has been president since May 2005 and chairman of the secular Fatah party since 2009. Also that same year, the leadership of the Palestinian Central Council announced an indefinite extension of Abbas's term as president. Political leadership is deeply divided between the West Bank under Fatah, and Hamas, which has controlled the Gaza Strip since 2006. Legislative elections were scheduled for May 2021 but were postponed by President Abbas a month before they were due to take place. Critics accuse the Fatah leadership of corruption and inefficiency, and ofbeing increasingly authoritarian. In October 2022, delegates from 14 different Palestinian factions including Fatah and Hamas met in Algiers to sign a reconciliation agreement. The Algiers Declaration includes provisions to hold presidential and parliamentary elections within a year of its signing. Given the political situation in which they live, Palestinians are avid media consumers. Online outlets are the main sources for news consumption, followed by TV and radio. Political instability and security threats mean journalists work in a high-risk environment. They continue to be subjected to restrictions by the PA, Hamas and Israel. The media landscape is shaped by the conflict with IsraelÂ and the rivalry between the Palestinian Authority (PA) under Fatah and their opponents Hamas. International watchdogs say the media environment is not free. Read fullmedia profile Muslim worshippers attend Friday noon prayers near the Dome of the Rock mosque in Jerusalem The war that followed Israel's declaration of independence in 1948 saw the former British mandate of Palestine partitioned between Israel, Jordan and Egypt. Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled or were forced out of their native land during the war, in what they call the ""Nakba"" or ""Catastrophe"". The demand of these refugees and their descendants to return to their former homes remains one of the most fiercely debated aspects of the dispute with Israel. The Palestinian national movement gradually regrouped in the West Bank and Gaza, run respectively by Jordan and Egypt, and in refugee camps in neighbouring Arab states. The Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) emerged as its leading umbrella group shortly before the Six-Day War of 1967, during which Israel captured the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem, and conducted a protracted campaign of violence against Israel. The PLO under Yasser Arafat gradually won international recognition as the representative of the Palestinian people, culminating in the Oslo Accords with Israel in 1993. These accords established a Palestinian National Authority (PNA - also referred to as the Palestinian Authority, or PA) as an interim body to run parts of Gaza and the West Bank (but not East Jerusalem) pending an agreed solution to the conflict. The PNA functions as an agency of the PLO, which represents Palestinians at international bodies. It is led by a directly-elected president, who appoints a prime minister and government which must have the support of the elected Legislative Council. The Israeli occupation of the West Bank, with its continuing settlement building and military checkpoints, and Palestinian attacks have slowed progress towards any final agreement. In 2005, Israel completed the withdrawal of all its troops and settlers from the Gaza Strip. In 2006, the Islamist group Hamas won elections in Gaza. A year later Hamas took full control of Gaza, ousting Palestinian Authority (PA) security forces in days of fighting. Following its takeover, Israel and Egypt imposed a tight blockade against the militants which has squeezed the Palestinian territory. Internationally, Hamas is widely seen as a terrorist group. The PA made a symbolic bid for recognition at the UN as the ""State of Palestine"" in 2011, mainly in an effort to highlight the lack of movement in relations with Israel. This failed to gain the required support, but Unesco - the UN cultural and educational agency - did admit the ""State of Palestine"" as a member. In November 2012, the UN General Assembly voted to upgrade the status of the Palestinians to that of a ""non-member observer state"" - a move that allows them to take part in General Assembly debates and improves their chances of joining UN agencies. In 2017, Hamas and Fatah signed a reconciliation deal that was meant to see Hamas hand over administrative control of Gaza to the Fatah-dominated Palestinian Authority but disputes over disarmament stalled progress. In 2022, delegates from 14 different Palestinian factions including Fatah and Hamas met in Algiers to sign a new reconciliation deal, including provisions to hold presidential and parliamentary elections by the end of 2023.

"The singer initially defended her decision to perform at the Meteor Festival Lana Del Rey has postponed a scheduled performance in Israel following a backlash from fans and activists. ""It's important to me to perform in both Palestine and Israel and treat all my fans equally,"" the singer said in a statement posted on Twitter. She added that she was hoping to ""schedule visits for both my Israeli and Palestinian fans"" in future.

"Apple is believed to have a secretive driving division known as Project Titan A self-driving car owned by Apple was involved in an accident, Californiaâs road authority has confirmed. The car, a modified Lexus RX450h with autonomous sensors, was rear-ended by a human driver in a Nissan Leaf. Humans were unhurt, but the machines suffered moderate damage. Appleâs car is understood to be part of an ambitious but secretive programme - Project Titan. Apple has not commented on the 24 August collision, understood to be the company's first. Speculation as to what the project seeks to achieve ranges from a fully-fledged Apple car - or just working with existing car makers to provide autonomous technology. Appleâs self-driving programme had been public knowledge, It was revealed that the company now has 66 such cars on the roads, with 111 drivers registered to operate them. Like every firm experimenting with autonomy in California, Apple must provide regular reports to the stateâs Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV), including when a crash occurs. 'Waiting for a safe gap' According to documents released by the DMV on Friday, Appleâs car was on the roads in Sunnyvale, a Silicon Valley city not far from Appleâs headquarters in Cupertino. The crash happened just before 15:00 - it was dry, clear and there were no unusual conditions, the DMV said. âAn Apple test vehicle in autonomous mode was rear-ended while preparing to merge onto Lawrence Expressway South from Kifer Road,â the incident description reads. âThe Apple test vehicle was travelling less than 1mph waiting for a safe gap to complete the merge when a 2016 Nissan Leaf contacted the Apple test vehicle at approximately 15mph. ""Both vehicles sustained damage and no injuries were reported by either party.â The DMV does not attribute blame in its reports. Self-driving cars being rear-ended, however, might be considered a trend. A recent report by investigative technology news site The Information revealed teething problems at Waymo,external, the self-driving car company spun out of Google, where there have been headaches caused by what humans might consider over-cautious driving. The self-driving cars would stop abruptly in scenarios where humans might zip through, such as turning across a line of traffic. ""As a result, human drivers from time to time have rear-ended the Waymo vans,â the report noted. _____ Follow Dave Lee onTwitter @DaveLeeBBC,external Do you have more information about this or any other technology story?

"Anyone turning 16 from now can start managing their Child Trust Funds for the first time - although some may be unaware that they have these savings. These funds were set up by the Labour government in 2005 to encourage parents to save for their children and to promote financial awareness. They began with an automatic contribution from the government. Campaigners worry that hundreds of thousands remain unaware of the money, which would total hundreds of pounds. Why are so many of us not saving for a rainy day? Young workers 'aware of pension reality' Initially, the government provided a Â£250 voucher in the child's first year and the same amount again when they reached the age of seven, to be invested in cash or stocks and shares on the child's behalf until he or she turned 18. Children born from September 2002 were eligible. If the child was born into a family with a low household income then the payments totalled Â£500. In August 2010, those sums were reduced to Â£50, or Â£100 for those in low-income homes. These stopped entirely in January 2011 during the coalition government, but in the meantime six million young people were assigned these savings, which could be topped up by their family, friends or the children themselves. These accounts remain, although some people would have switched them into Junior Isas. September marks 16 years since eligibility for the first funds began and, under the rules, anyone turning 16 can apply to take over the management of their fund from their parents, their carers, or the UK tax authority. Although they are unable to withdraw these savings until they turn 18, they will still be able to manage their account such as choosing which provider oversees their investment. An estimated 75,000 youngsters will turn 16 in September alone, giving them the opportunity to do so. However, more than one million of these funds are ""lost"" to the youngsters who are supposed to benefit from them, according to Gavin Oldham, chairman of the Share Foundation, which administers Child Trust Funds for children in care. He said that these funds - including about 440,000 for children from disadvantaged backgrounds - were opened almost entirely by HM Revenue and Customs on the children's behalf, when their parents had not done so within the first year of their birth. They would probably have received a letter when the fund was set up, but may have ignored it or moved away. Typically, the fund is now worth Â£1,600. ""There should be a special effort from the government to re-link these [funds] to the young people to whom they belong,"" he said. HMRC has adedicated service to help people find out where their Child Trust Fund is held,external. The tax authority wrote to parents as their child became eligible for a Child Trust Fund and, after that, any communication should have been between them and the provider of the trust fund account.

"Alex Salmond launched the appeal for Â£50,000 to pay for legal action against the Scottish government Alex Salmond's crowdfunding appeal to pay for his legal action against the Scottish government has closed after raising double its Â£50,000 target. The former first minister is seeking a judicial review of the government's handling of sexual misconduct complaints against him. Mr Salmond strongly denies the allegations, describing them as ""patently ridiculous"". His fundraiser has been heavily criticised by opposition parties. They have raised concerns that the high-profile crowdfunding campaign could make women less likely to come forward with sexual harassment complaints against other powerful men in the future. Brian Taylor: SNP in turmoil, but not civil war Salmond allegations: What do we know? How the Salmond story has played out online The appeal, which was closed on Saturday, raised Â£100,007 in total. Mr Salmond thanked all of those who had contributed and said: ""The petition for judicial review has now been served and all of you helped make that possible. ""We have now closed the fund with double the amount aimed for raised in double quick time. ""Every penny of surplus funds, which will be substantial in the event of a successful judicial review, will be distributed to good causes in Scotland and beyond."" The complaints against Mr Salmond relate to allegations about his conduct towards two staff members in 2013, while he was first minister. Mr Salmond, who led the Scottish government between 2007 and 2014, launched his crowdfunder on Wednesday evening as he announced he was quitting the SNP to focus on clearing his name. He said he was doing so because he feared there would be ""substantial internal division"" within the party if his successor Nicola Sturgeon was forced to suspend him, and has stressed that he intends to rejoin the party after clearing his name. The crowdfunder reached its Â£50,000 target within a few hours of its launch, and passed the Â£100,000 mark on Saturday - with more than 4,000 people contributing to it. Many of those who left messages on the crowdfunding page said they donated as they believed Mr Salmond was innocent, with some saying they believed he had been targeted because of his support for independence. However, a Scottish Conservative party spokesman described the appeal as ""crass"". He added: ""Alex Salmond should never have been squeezing cash out of SNP supporters in the first place. ""His legal action has nothing to do with independence, yet he used the cause to convince the party faithful to cough up. ""It was crass and certainly not becoming of a former first minister of Scotland."" Mr Salmond has said that ""all sums received will contribute exclusively to progressing the judicial review and any money left over will be used to support good causes in Scotland and beyond."" He claims that new Scottish government procedures for investigating harassment complaints against current and former ministers were unfair and unlawful, and has asked the Court of Session to examine them. Alex Salmond is seeking a judicial review at the Court of Session in Edinburgh Ms Sturgeon, the current first minister, has staunchly defended the Scottish government's investigation into the two complaints that were made against Mr Salmond, telling BBC Scotland on Wednesday thatthe rules also had to be fair to the women making the allegations. She also said she wants a culture where people were able to come forward with complaints regardless of ""how senior, how powerful, how well-known or what the political allegiance is"" of the person involved. Spent much of today chatting to sundry folk within the SNP and the wider independence movement. I was struck by the plaintive, woebegone nature of the exchanges - or most of them. Struck but not remotely surprised. In the short term, it is hard to see the events of the past week as anything other than deeply damaging for the SNP. None was prepared to deploy the term ""civil war"" about the party's current travails. I think I can understand why. Strictly, a political civil war would involve two or more distinct factions, with evident leaders and an ideological distinction. This is different. This is turmoil, confusion, disquiet. One source described an ordinary SNP branch meeting this week. Folk were unsure, uncertain what to say or do. I suspect that is more typical than the zealous certainty one occasionally encounters on social media, which prompted the ""civil war"" description in the first place. Still, it matters little. Turmoil can be just as undermining, just as sapping of confidence as outright political conflict. Indeed, it can be worse. Uncertainty breeds disquiet and can demoralise, if unchecked.

""The second respondent is the Scottish government.""

"Parking at all NHS hospitals in Wales is now free - a decade after the Welsh Government first announced the policy. Glangwili and Prince Philip hospitals, in Carmarthenshire, were the last to have the charges. But it will be free to park from now on, after a contract with a parking firm expired at the end of August. Hospitals in Northern Ireland and England still charge for parking, with the latter makingÂ£174m from the charges last year. Parking fees were scrapped for hospitals in Scotland in 2009, but a number of NHS sites still charge for privately-run car parks. The Welsh Government said it was pleased to see free parking in place in all hospitals in Wales. Cardiff NHS hospital staff lose parking tickets case Parking fines to be introduced at Bangor hospital In June, parking charges at Wales' largest hospital, the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff, were dropped after its contract with a private firm ended. It had cost up to Â£10 a day to park at the site. The charges had been a controversial issue for staff as well as patients and visitors, and in July 2017, 75 members of staff lost a court case against Indigo which compelled them to pay thousands of pounds in parking tickets they owed. It left the two hospitals, managed by Hywel Dda University Health Board, as the only ones to charge for parking as the board was locked into a contract. But this came to an end on Saturday and the board decided to lift the charges as it looks at ways to improve parking at the sites for staff, visitors and patients. When the free hospital parking policy was announced by the thenHealth Minister Edwina Hart in March 2008 it was intended to start the following month,external. Where health boards were already bound by legal contracts, they were required to ""reduce costs for patients, staff and visitors"". In the year before the announcement, Welsh hospitals collected nearly Â£5.4m in parking charges. The director of operations at Hywel Dda University Health Board acknowledged there were parking ""issues"" at both sites. Those visiting Glangwili and Prince Philip hospitals will now have their tickets validated on-site. The health board said it was also considering the use of automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) technology to monitor use of hospital car parks. The ANPR cameras will be used for monitoring and data collection purposes. Joe Teape, director of operations and deputy chief executive at Hywel Dda University Health Board, said: ""We're engaging with staff and the public to ensure a fairer deal for everyone, by protecting designated patient and visitor car parks and improving access for emergency vehicles."" A Welsh Government spokesman said: ""We are pleased to see free parking is now in place at all hospitals in Wales. ""Car parking charges are often an unfair expense on people frequently attending NHS hospitals, whether they are patients, staff or visitors.

"Alex Salmond launched the appeal for Â£50,000 to pay for legal action against the Scottish government Alex Salmond's crowdfunding appeal to pay for his legal action against the Scottish government has closed after raising double its Â£50,000 target. The former first minister is seeking a judicial review of the government's handling of sexual misconduct complaints against him. Mr Salmond strongly denies the allegations, describing them as ""patently ridiculous"". His fundraiser has been heavily criticised by opposition parties. They have raised concerns that the high-profile crowdfunding campaign could make women less likely to come forward with sexual harassment complaints against other powerful men in the future. Brian Taylor: SNP in turmoil, but not civil war Salmond allegations: What do we know? How the Salmond story has played out online The appeal, which was closed on Saturday, raised Â£100,007 in total. Mr Salmond thanked all of those who had contributed and said: ""The petition for judicial review has now been served and all of you helped make that possible. ""We have now closed the fund with double the amount aimed for raised in double quick time. ""Every penny of surplus funds, which will be substantial in the event of a successful judicial review, will be distributed to good causes in Scotland and beyond."" The complaints against Mr Salmond relate to allegations about his conduct towards two staff members in 2013, while he was first minister. Mr Salmond, who led the Scottish government between 2007 and 2014, launched his crowdfunder on Wednesday evening as he announced he was quitting the SNP to focus on clearing his name. He said he was doing so because he feared there would be ""substantial internal division"" within the party if his successor Nicola Sturgeon was forced to suspend him, and has stressed that he intends to rejoin the party after clearing his name. The crowdfunder reached its Â£50,000 target within a few hours of its launch, and passed the Â£100,000 mark on Saturday - with more than 4,000 people contributing to it. Many of those who left messages on the crowdfunding page said they donated as they believed Mr Salmond was innocent, with some saying they believed he had been targeted because of his support for independence. However, a Scottish Conservative party spokesman described the appeal as ""crass"". He added: ""Alex Salmond should never have been squeezing cash out of SNP supporters in the first place. ""His legal action has nothing to do with independence, yet he used the cause to convince the party faithful to cough up. ""It was crass and certainly not becoming of a former first minister of Scotland."" Mr Salmond has said that ""all sums received will contribute exclusively to progressing the judicial review and any money left over will be used to support good causes in Scotland and beyond."" He claims that new Scottish government procedures for investigating harassment complaints against current and former ministers were unfair and unlawful, and has asked the Court of Session to examine them. Alex Salmond is seeking a judicial review at the Court of Session in Edinburgh Ms Sturgeon, the current first minister, has staunchly defended the Scottish government's investigation into the two complaints that were made against Mr Salmond, telling BBC Scotland on Wednesday thatthe rules also had to be fair to the women making the allegations. She also said she wants a culture where people were able to come forward with complaints regardless of ""how senior, how powerful, how well-known or what the political allegiance is"" of the person involved. Spent much of today chatting to sundry folk within the SNP and the wider independence movement. I was struck by the plaintive, woebegone nature of the exchanges - or most of them. Struck but not remotely surprised. In the short term, it is hard to see the events of the past week as anything other than deeply damaging for the SNP. None was prepared to deploy the term ""civil war"" about the party's current travails. I think I can understand why. Strictly, a political civil war would involve two or more distinct factions, with evident leaders and an ideological distinction. This is different. This is turmoil, confusion, disquiet. One source described an ordinary SNP branch meeting this week. Folk were unsure, uncertain what to say or do. I suspect that is more typical than the zealous certainty one occasionally encounters on social media, which prompted the ""civil war"" description in the first place. Still, it matters little. Turmoil can be just as undermining, just as sapping of confidence as outright political conflict. Indeed, it can be worse. Uncertainty breeds disquiet and can demoralise, if unchecked. Read more from Brian Mr Salmond lodged his petition seeking a judicial review at the Court of Session earlier this week, with legal papers formally being served on the Scottish government on Friday. A statement from his solicitors, Levy & McRae, said: ""We can also confirm that first respondent is the Permanent Secretary, Ms Leslie Evans, who established the procedure which is the subject of challenge. ""The second respondent is the Scottish government."" Ms Evans, who is the Scottish government's most senior civil servant, was asked by Ms Sturgeon last year to carry out a review of the government's existing harassment procedures in the wake of concerns about the potential scale of the problem at Holyrood, Westminster and beyond. The new procedures were subsequently introduced with Ms Sturgeon's blessing in December - with the complaints against Mr Salmond being made the following month. The FDA trade union, which represents civil servants, has previouslyattacked Mr Salmond for singling out Ms Evans,external, who it said had been acting on the instructions of Ms Sturgeon in setting up the complaints procedure.

"Lizzie Carr, from Croydon, will be collecting water samples so micro plastic levels in the river can be analysed A woman from London is to travel the whole length of the Hudson River in the US on a stand-up paddle board to raise awareness of plastic pollution. Lizzie Carr will be collecting water samples so microplastic levels in the river can be analysed. The environmentalist from Croydon said she chose the US for her trip because it was ""one of the world's biggest consumers of single use plastic"". She plans to cover 170 miles over eight days starting on Thursday. Lizzie Carr says paddle boards are more practical to collect water samples and plastic waste, compared to boats The majority of plastic in the US is ""only used once before it's thrown away"", she said. Ms Carr, who became the first person to paddle board the length of England solo and unsupported in 2016 after surviving cancer a year earlier, added: ""This is a man-made problem. ""80% of marine debris starts from inland sources, including rivers like the Hudson, before it eventually flows out to the ocean. ""I want my journey along the Hudson to motivate people to take action, so together, we can make a real difference to resolve the global problem of plastics choking out seas."" Ms Carr wants to motivate people to take action over our increasingly polluted waterways The water samples will be analysed afterwards by the Hudson River Park Trust. Ms Carr's board will be fitted with a ""smart"" fin that will measure the water temperature - a move she said would help interpret the impact of global warming. The data will be collected by a chip in the fin and transmitted to an oceanographic research institute. 'Shame and anger' at plastic ocean pollution Microplastic threat to ocean giants Plastic in Pacific Ocean 'growing rapidly' Ms Carr, who became the first woman to paddle board solo across the English Channel in 2017, will also be logging plastic waste she sees along the way by geo-tagging it on an an app run by her charity Planet Patrol. The adventurer set up the charity earlier this year to encourage people to clean up Britain's waterways. The cancer survivor has organised numerous paddle board-led water clean-ups in the UK as part of her charity Planet Patrol So far, more than 50,000 plastic hotspots have been logged in 14 countries on the app via crowdsourcing.

"Parking at all NHS hospitals in Wales is now free - a decade after the Welsh Government first announced the policy. Glangwili and Prince Philip hospitals, in Carmarthenshire, were the last to have the charges. But it will be free to park from now on, after a contract with a parking firm expired at the end of August. Hospitals in Northern Ireland and England still charge for parking, with the latter makingÂ£174m from the charges last year. Parking fees were scrapped for hospitals in Scotland in 2009, but a number of NHS sites still charge for privately-run car parks. The Welsh Government said it was pleased to see free parking in place in all hospitals in Wales. Cardiff NHS hospital staff lose parking tickets case Parking fines to be introduced at Bangor hospital In June, parking charges at Wales' largest hospital, the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff, were dropped after its contract with a private firm ended. It had cost up to Â£10 a day to park at the site. The charges had been a controversial issue for staff as well as patients and visitors, and in July 2017, 75 members of staff lost a court case against Indigo which compelled them to pay thousands of pounds in parking tickets they owed. It left the two hospitals, managed by Hywel Dda University Health Board, as the only ones to charge for parking as the board was locked into a contract. But this came to an end on Saturday and the board decided to lift the charges as it looks at ways to improve parking at the sites for staff, visitors and patients. When the free hospital parking policy was announced by the thenHealth Minister Edwina Hart in March 2008 it was intended to start the following month,external. Where health boards were already bound by legal contracts, they were required to ""reduce costs for patients, staff and visitors"". In the year before the announcement, Welsh hospitals collected nearly Â£5.4m in parking charges. The director of operations at Hywel Dda University Health Board acknowledged there were parking ""issues"" at both sites. Those visiting Glangwili and Prince Philip hospitals will now have their tickets validated on-site. The health board said it was also considering the use of automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) technology to monitor use of hospital car parks. The ANPR cameras will be used for monitoring and data collection purposes. Joe Teape, director of operations and deputy chief executive at Hywel Dda University Health Board, said: ""We're engaging with staff and the public to ensure a fairer deal for everyone, by protecting designated patient and visitor car parks and improving access for emergency vehicles."" A Welsh Government spokesman said: ""We are pleased to see free parking is now in place at all hospitals in Wales. ""Car parking charges are often an unfair expense on people frequently attending NHS hospitals, whether they are patients, staff or visitors.

"Officers found 11 starving children at the remote compound, and the remains of a toddler Five adults at a desert compound in New Mexico have been arrested by the FBI weeks after a judge received death threats for granting them bail. The two men and three women, residents at a site where 11 starving children and the buried remains of a toddler were found, face conspiracy charges. Child abuse charges against the five were dismissed after a 10-day limit for a hearing was missed by prosecutors. They will now remain in custody pending a hearing in federal court on Tuesday. Thecharges include unlawful possession of firearms by an illegal immigrant, which carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison, and aiding and abetting in the committing of an offence,external, the FBI said in a statement on Friday. The accused had been under FBI drone surveillance at their remote compound north of Taos since May, according to Taos County Sheriff Jerry Hogrefe. US compound boy 'died during ritual' US children 'trained to attack schools' Police raided the compound near Amalia in early August in the search for a missing three-year-old boy, Abdul-Ghani Wahhaj. It was then that they discovered the remains of a young boy along with 11 malnourished children, who were reportedly being held at the site. Police also seized ""at least 11 firearms and a large quantity of ammunition"". The boy's father, Siraj Wahhaj, is suspected of abducting him from his Georgia home in December and was one of the five arrested. He was detained at the site, along with Lucas Morten, Jany Leveille, Hujhrah Wahhaj and Subhannah Wahhaj. On 13 August, Judge Sarah Backus granted bail to the five defendants after she said the prosecution had failed to convince her that they were a threat to the community. The prosecution argued that all five adults were dangerous and claimed they had trained the children to use weapons and prepare to carry out school shootings. ""The state alleges that there was a big plan afoot, but the state hasn't shown to my satisfaction, in clear and convincing evidence, what that plan was,"" Judge Backus said. She ordered that all five must wear ankle monitors and have weekly contact with their lawyers. But her decision was met with protests including an email in which she was called an ""Islamic terror sympathiser"". The Taos County court building was evacuated briefly on Tuesday after the threats. Suspects Siraj Wahhaj (L) and Lucas Morton Prosecutors also said that the remains found at the site were those of Abdul-Ghani and that the other children said the boy had died during a ""religious ritual... intended to cast out demonic spirits"", during which Siraj Wahhaj had put his hand to his son's forehead, and recited verses from the Koran. Abdul-Ghani suffered from seizures, but Mr Wahhaj believed the boy was possessed by the devil and needed to be exorcised, court papers said.

"Lula's supporters regularly take to the streets in protest Brazil's top electoral court has ruled that jailed former President Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva cannot run as a candidate in the presidential election because of his corruption conviction. Judges voted against his running in October's ballot by a majority of six votes to one in the seven-member court. Lula, 72, was leading in polls ahead of the vote despite serving a 12-year jail term for accepting a bribe. His legal team has said they will appeal against the court's decision. Brazil's Workers' Party (PT) later responded to the court's decision in a statement, saying it would ""fight by all means"" for Lula's candidacy. ""We will present all appeals before the courts for the recognition of the rights of Lula provided by law and international treaties ratified by Brazil,"" the statement said, adding: ""We will defend Lula in the streets, with the people."" A quick guide to Brazil's scandals Lula: Only death will take me off streets Lula's conviction for money laundering and corruption was upheld in January. In Brazil, no one convicted of a crime upheld on appeal can run for office. However, exceptions have been made to the law before. In declaring Lula ineligible to stand on Friday, one judge said: ""What is at stake here today is the equality of all citizens before the law and the Constitution."" Lula was convicted of receiving a renovated beachfront apartment worth some 3.7m reais ($1.1m; Â£790,000) as a bribe by engineering firm OAS. He denied wrongdoing and said his conviction was part of a plot to prevent him returning to power. Polls suggest around a third of Brazilians would back Lula if he ran The former president is the most high-profile person convicted in the sweeping Operation Car Wash anti-corruption investigation. Despite his jail sentence,PT voted to nominate Lula as its candidate last month. Lula reportedly chose Fernando Haddad, former mayor of SÃ£o Paulo, to run for the PT should he be prevented from doing so. Serving as president from 2003 to 2011, Lula presided over a surge in economic growth and major social programmes that left him with an 87% approval rating on leaving office. But the former leader surrendered to police in April after his corruption conviction. This video can not be played Lula forced his way through crowds of his supporters to turn himself in An appeal in January not only saw the court uphold his original conviction, but also increase the length of the sentence by two-and-a-half years. Before Friday's court judgement on whether he could run, Brazil's prosecutor general filed to bar his candidacy due to the law prohibiting those who have lost appeals against their conviction from standing. Despite this, recent polls reportedly showed that around one-third of Brazilians would back Lula if he were allowed to run, which would make him the front-runner in October's vote.

"Pastor Charles Ellis was among those who paid tribute to Franklin The funeral for soul legend Aretha Franklin is taking place in Detroit, two weeks after she died of pancreatic cancer, aged 76. The five-hour service has seen tributes and reminiscences from dozens of friends, family members, music legends and dignitaries. Here are some of the most memorable quotes from the Queen of Soul's service. The former president pulled out his phone and played a clip of Aretha's hit single Think ""We started out, not as a president, a first lady, a senator, a secretary of state. We started out as, like, Aretha groupies."" ""When we are getting out of college is when she finally got her big breakthrough. ""It's one thing I want to say to the people in the audience: She had the voice of generation, maybe the voice of a century but she also worked for years, I mean years, when nobody was paying particular attention. ""The secret of her greatness was she took this massive talent and this perfect culture that raised her and decided to be the composer of her own life's song - and what a song it turned out to be."" ""I just loved her."" ""My mother died in 2009 and it was her who introduced me to the voice of Aretha Franklin. We'd be driving up to the country and she'd have music blasting - and I could tell what my father had done by the music she was playing. ""If she was playing Respect or Think I knew he had done something wrong; but if she was playing Dr Feelgood he might have done something right."" ""I didn't know, especially this soon, that I was going to have to say goodbye to you. We talked about it many times that we're the two that were left from all of our neighbourhood friends. ""You're gonna be one of the future voices in the choir of angels because you know you'd have to be. The world is celebrating you and the world is gonna miss you and I know that I'm gonna miss you so much because I miss our talks."" ""She never relied on anyone else to tell her story. She wrote her own script. She handled her own business. ""She understood how to wield power without raising her voice. She was paid in advance if she performed. She'd insist there was no air conditioning if she was to sing.  She refused to be extorted or disrespected."" ""The reason that we are here today is because of love. Because of how much we love this woman. ""The greatest gift we have been given in life itself is love. We can talk about all the things that are wrong - and there are many - but the only thing that can deliver us is love. ""So what needs to happen today, not only in this nation but throughout this world, is that we need to make love great again. That is what Aretha said througout her life. Through the pain, she gave us the joy and said, 'Let's make love great again.'"" ""From a young age, Aretha Franklin rocked the world of anyone who had the pleasure of hearing her voice. ""In the example she set both as an artist and a citizen, Aretha embodied those most revered virtues of forgiveness and reconciliation, while the music she made captured some of our deepest human desires, namely affection and respect. And through her voice, her own voice, Aretha lifted those of millions empowering and inspiring the vulnerable, the downtrodden, and everyone who may have just needed a little love."" ""Laura and I are deeply saddened by the loss of the Queen of Soul, Aretha Franklin. Our hearts ache for you and our prayers are with you. Aretha was a woman of achievement with a deep character and a loving heart. She made important and lasting contributions to American music with her gospel-inspired style and distinctive voice. ""Her remarkable talent helped shape our nation's artistic and cultural heritage and in 2005 it was my privilege to honour her with our country's highest civilian award - the Presidential Medal of Freedom. I am proud to have met Aretha, and am grateful that her music will continue to bring joy to millions for generations to come. As you remember and honour Aretha's life may the almighty comfort you in your grief and sustain you during this difficult time."" Victorie Franklin comforts Jordin Franklin, Aretha's grandson, as he pays tribute ""When I would go to her shows and watch her sing it would be the best feeling in the world. Nothing sounded better to me than the way my grandma sings. Her voice made you feel something. You felt every word, every note, every emotion in the songs she sang. Her voice brought peace. ""It feels amazing to see a woman so fierce, so courageous, gifted, so respected and to be able to call [her] my grandmother; to know that I have that running through my blood and that she's a part of who I am."" ""Behind her God-given natural talent was the drive of a total perfectionist. She privately rehearsed, she practiced, she prepared. And by the time she came into the studio, she literally owned the songs. ""Everyone in the studio would be in awe of her mastery when she stepped up to the microphone. It was a real rarity if she ever were to do more than two takes."" ""Thank you Lord for Aretha: She was strong in her spirit, pure in her heart, generous in her giving, sweet in her compassion, calm in her demeanour, gentle in her touch, powerful in her embrace. ""Thank you for Aretha: She was wise in her advice, bold in her speech, classy in her walk, stylish in her apparel, faithful in her service, loving to her family, loyal to her faith, and submissive to her God. ""Thank you for Aretha: She was a bright and shining star, she was an image of hope larger than life, she was a soldier, a trouper, an encourager, a good and faithful servant. ""Thank you for Aretha: She charmed us, she thrilled us, she entertained us, she inspired us, she motivated us, she helped us, she blessed us, one and all. ""Thank you, Lord, for Aretha: Lord you gave us a Queen, a trouper, a true queen, royalty at its best, and we thank you."" ""Aretha Franklin was given special gifts but she used [them] in a special way. She would not want us to celebrate her without talking about [how] she stood for something. She represented the best in our community and she fought for our community until the end."" ""She was a feminist before feminism was popular. She was a civil rights activist when it wasn't popular. She gave us pride, and she gave us a regal bar to reach. And that's why we're all here. We don't agree on everything, but we agree on Aretha. ""[President] Trump said, 'she used to work for me'. No, she used to perform for you. She worked for us. Aretha never took orders from nobody but God."" ""When Aretha sang, she lifted the downtrodden spirits and challenged presidents to remember the voices of millions. ""Her voice was mixed with the joy and sadness, the tears and screams of her people down through the ages. She sang in our key and she taught the world how to hear it. ""She specialised in singing that moved the soul, stirred the spirit, and made us aware of a divine presence that could not be denied. ""In the midst of our nation's current moral crisis, we need again that gospel that Aretha sang."" ""We have plenty of programs today. Some of them are going to end up on eBay.""

"Unrwa provides critical services, including education and health care ""Dignity is priceless,"" read the signs as thousands of employees of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees march through central Gaza City. They fear Washington's recent decision to withhold $65m (52.5m euros; Â£46m) - possibly rising to $290m - in funds could affect their positions as well as basic services which most of them, as refugees, rely on. ""Unrwa was there every moment for me,"" says Najwa Sheikh Ahmed, an information officer with the UN Relief and Works Agency. ""It gave not only food, clothes, education and healthcare but also a job and the opportunity that offers your family."" Najwa was born in Khan Younis refugee camp and brought up in tough conditions. Thousands of Unrwa supporters and staff have held protests in Gaza She moved to Nuseirat camp when she married her husband, who is also Unrwa staff.  They have five children. When I visit, we pass along narrow streets to the local clinic, painted in the blue and white colours of the UN, so Najwa can get a medical check. I watch her eldest daughter, Salma, as she excels in an English lesson.  She is one of 270,000 Unrwa students in Gaza. Salma Sheikh Ahmed attends lessons in an Unrwa-run school ""As a mother I feel very worried,"" Najwa confides. ""If the funding gap isn't bridged, then Unrwa might find itself in a situation where [it has] to close the schools and health services. My children will be at risk."" The US is the largest single donor to Unrwa.  Last year, it gave the agency around $360m - about half of the total amount it gave in support to the Palestinians. President Donald Trump first indicated a change in approach on 2 January whenhe Tweeted that his country got ""no appreciation or respect"",externalfor the large sums of aid it gave. The State Department insists that freezing Unrwa funds is linked to needed ""reforms"", but suspicions remain that it is meant to punish Palestinian leaders. They cut ties with the White House weeks earlier after it recognised Jerusalem as Israel's capital.  The Palestinians claim East Jerusalem as the capital of their future state. Last week in Davos, Switzerland, Mr Trump said that aid to the Palestinians would be suspended ""unless they sit down and negotiate peace"". In the impoverished Gaza Strip, which has eight refugee camps, ordinary people complain that they find themselves helplessly caught up in geopolitics. Unrwa was originally set up to take care of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians displaced by the 1948 Arab-Israeli war. Nearly 70 years on, some of those refugees and many of their descendants continue to live in camps, which are now chronically overcrowded breeze block neighbourhoods. More than five million Palestinians are registered as refugees Unrwa supports some five million people not only in the Palestinian Territories but also in Jordan, Lebanon and Syria - where Palestinian refugees have limited rights. The fate of the refugees is a core issue in the Arab-Israeli conflict and they have often been at the heart of Palestinian political and militant activity. Palestinians call for their ""right to return"" to parts of historic Palestine - land which is now in Israel. Israel rejects that claim and has often criticised the set-up of Unrwa for the way it allows refugee status to be inherited, which it points out is uniquely applied to Palestinians among all the world's refugees. ""How long are we going to have Unrwa? Another 70 years?"" the Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said to me at a recent press event. ""We already have great-great-grandchildren who are refugees - who are not refugees but they're on the list of Unwra."" The US says Unrwa needs to become more accountable Mr Netanyahu suggests donations should be shifted to other humanitarian agencies, including the UN High Commission for Refugees. ""It will have positive effects because the perpetuation of the dream of bringing the descendants back to Jaffa is what sustains this conflict,"" he told me. ""Unrwa is part of the problem not part of the solution."" Unrwa officials stress that the UN General Assembly sets their mandate and dismiss the idea it obstructs any Israel-Palestinian peace deal. ""It is the failure of the political parties to resolve the refugee issue that perpetuates it,"" says Unrwa spokesman Chris Gunness. ""As soon as there's a resolution of that based on international law, based on United Nations resolutions, Unrwa will go out of business and hand over its service."" Israeli defence officials warn Unrwa's collapse could trigger an escalation in violence The agency has now launched a global appeal to fill the gap in its budget and isreceiving many messages of support,external- including from celebrities and 21 international humanitarian groups. Some in Israel also raise concerns that weakening Unrwa could cause regional instability and create more extremism. ""While Unrwa is far from perfect, the Israeli defence establishment and the Israeli government as a whole, have over the years come to the understanding that all the alternatives are worse for Israel,"" aformer Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesman, Peter Lerner, wrote in Haaretz newspaper,external. At the rally in Gaza City, participants focus on the impact of any Unrwa cutbacks on the most needy but also on existential issues. ""Without Unrwa nobody will identify us as refugees,"" says Najwa Sheikh-Ahmed - whose father fled from his home in al-Majdal - now in Ashkelon in southern Israel - as a boy in 1948. ""My refugee number, my ration card is witness to the fact that once upon a time I had a homeland,"" she says.  ""Without this we will lose the right to fight for our rights.""

The almost seven hour service has drawn to a close. Thank you for joining us this afternoon/evening to help bid an official farewell to the Queen of Soul. Scroll down for performances and speeches from Aretha's family, as well as stars including Ariana Grande, Stevie Wonder, Smokey Robinson, Faith Hill, Jennifer Hudson, Gladys Knight and many many more during the seven and half hour ceremony at the Greater Grace Temple in her hometown Detroit. RIP Aretha. Thank you for the music and for continuing to inspire so many others. A final Lord's Prayer has been said. Now Jennifer Holliday and the Aretha Franklin Celebration Choir are providing the soundtrack to Aretha's gold casket being led out of the church. Everyone inside are now up on their feet and will follow out shortly. After performing an extended harmonica solo, Stevie paid tribute to his friend. ""Without God's goodness and greatness, we would never have known the Queen of Soul, we would have never known the joy she brought to us, someone who could express in song the pain that we felt. ""The reason we are here today is because of love, because of how much we love this woman. ""Across this nation and across the world we need to make love great again, because black lives DO matter, because all lives matter."" The last comment possibly a dig at previous speaker, Reverend Jasper Williams Jr. Stevie then performed his 1976 track, I'll Be Loving You Always, which was later covered by George Michael and Mary J Blige. ""I want everyone to sing along, I'd appreciate it... if you don't, I'll see you later,"" he joked. The 68-year-old was at Aretha's bedside, shortly before her death two weeks ago. The Motown star sang at the last night's official tribute concert but she wasn't listed as a performer tonight. Now she's arrived on stage at the seventh hour of proceedings at Greater Grace Temple. She belted out a  heartfelt rendition of the song from the musical Carousel, which Liverpool and Celtic FC fans reading will know well, as well Paul Simon's Bridge Over Troubled Water. Barring anymore surprises, Stevie Wonder is surely up next. We're coming towards the end of the ceremony now. Rev. Jasper Williams Jr, the Pastor at Salem Baptist
Church, Atlanta, is delivering a rather lengthy official eulogy now. He delivered the eulogy at Aretha's father CL Franklin's funeral too. Some of his views on the role of black women in the home appear to have caused much conjecture online. He should wrap up his half hour speech soon so we can watch a bit of Stevie Wonder.

Former Detroit Pistons NBA player Isaiah Thomas has been letting us into another side of the Queen of Soul. Aretha the sports fan. Thomas began by remembering how his mother would sit in the window and sing Aretha's Say a Little Prayer For You, after his dad lost his job. When he got his big break in basketball with a move to Detroit, he ""got to know Aretha personally. ""It was actually the first family I met when I got to Detroit. ""I know a lot of people are smiling and thinking how I was when you first met me and how naive I was about this thing called celebrity. ""I didn't know how to pay my bills... I knew nothing. And this family took care of me through some very tough times. Aretha Franklin watches Detroit Pistons v Miami Heat in 2011 I was honoured to get to know Aretha and she had a great love of sports. She loved the Detroit Pistons and I know I was her favourite bad boy  He added: ""But I gotta tell you there was nothing more inspiring for me
than to look up and see my mum sitting in the stands sitting next to Aretha,
sandwiched in between Stevie watching a Pistons game. ""I'd always pause during the game and think to myself, 'I wonder how
many nights they got my mum through and how many tears she shed listening to Aretha's music'. ""She found a way to inspire us with hope and love and dreams
through her music ""I'm going to miss you Aretha... the world's going to miss you... but most importantly, Detroit is going to miss you."" This video can not be played Aretha Franklin: Family and friends remember the Queen of Soul Former President Bill Clinton and Motown legend Smokey Robinson were among the key speakers at Aretha Franklin's funeral earlier. The event is being held at Greater Grace Temple, the church where the Queen of Soul was a featured performer at US civil rights champion Rosa Parks' funeral. BBC News has picked out some memorable moments so far on video. Watch above. Aretha's old manager - as much as that was possible - Clive Davis has described his former client as a ""true genius of american music."" The Sony Music chief creative officer told the crowd about the time he had dinner with the star - who ""loved her soul food"" - in 1979 ""when she was already, of course, the Queen of Soul"", with an arsenal of hits already. ""We talked into the night about the next five years of recording, when Aretha would be over 40 years old,"" he said. ""Much of music had changed, could she still compete? ""Well there was no doubt in Aretha's mind and frankly there was no doubt in my mind."" They went on to have many more hits in the second half of her career, including Sisters are Doing it for Themselves, alongside the Eurythmics. Allow YouTube content?

""Aretha's voice will be influencing others literally for centuries to come,"" he added. ""Behind her God-given talent was the drive of a perfectionist. ""She defined loyalty."" Tony and Emmy award-winning actress Cicley Tyler said Aretha ""was the sum total of her life's experience"". She continued: ""She shared that with us, through the soul songs she sang, she spoke to us through her soul and everything she experiences. ""And that's why no matter what she was singing she moved every single person."" The US film actor, writer and director has just made one of the quickest speeches of the event. He recalled some valuable life lessons he learned from his Aretha-fan mother, who died in 2009. ""We'd be driving up to the country and she'd
have music blasting - and I could tell what my father had done by the music she
was playing. ""If she was playing Respect or Think I knew he had done
something wrong; but if she was playing Dr Feelgood he might have done
something right!"" He finished by re-assuring everybody that ""grief comes in waves and you can make your way through it."" Tyler also attended the tribute show in Detroit on Thursday night.

While many people will already now about Aretha's lifelong commitment to the US civil rights movement, another cause close to her heart has just been revealed. Retired Detroit judge Greg Mathis has been speaking about the late soul star's support in the fight for justice over the Flint water pipes scandal. In 2014, the drinking water source for the city of Flint, Michigan was changed from Lake Huron and the Detroit River to the cheaper Flint River, which resulted in 100,000 of residents drinking water contaminated with lead. Mathis - who noted that his comments might not please one of the service's earlier speakers, underfire Michigan Governor Rick Snyder - said that when he was feeling defeated about the ongoing struggle, Aretha told him: ""You're supposed to be from Detroit - what are you scared of?"" Bottled drinking water for residents of Flint Mathis's mic then briefly cut out, causing him to joke ""somebody's going to jail!..""

"Anyone turning 16 from now can start managing their Child Trust Funds for the first time - although some may be unaware that they have these savings. These funds were set up by the Labour government in 2005 to encourage parents to save for their children and to promote financial awareness. They began with an automatic contribution from the government. Campaigners worry that hundreds of thousands remain unaware of the money, which would total hundreds of pounds. Why are so many of us not saving for a rainy day? Young workers 'aware of pension reality' Initially, the government provided a Â£250 voucher in the child's first year and the same amount again when they reached the age of seven, to be invested in cash or stocks and shares on the child's behalf until he or she turned 18. Children born from September 2002 were eligible. If the child was born into a family with a low household income then the payments totalled Â£500. In August 2010, those sums were reduced to Â£50, or Â£100 for those in low-income homes. These stopped entirely in January 2011 during the coalition government, but in the meantime six million young people were assigned these savings, which could be topped up by their family, friends or the children themselves. These accounts remain, although some people would have switched them into Junior Isas. September marks 16 years since eligibility for the first funds began and, under the rules, anyone turning 16 can apply to take over the management of their fund from their parents, their carers, or the UK tax authority. Although they are unable to withdraw these savings until they turn 18, they will still be able to manage their account such as choosing which provider oversees their investment. An estimated 75,000 youngsters will turn 16 in September alone, giving them the opportunity to do so. However, more than one million of these funds are ""lost"" to the youngsters who are supposed to benefit from them, according to Gavin Oldham, chairman of the Share Foundation, which administers Child Trust Funds for children in care. He said that these funds - including about 440,000 for children from disadvantaged backgrounds - were opened almost entirely by HM Revenue and Customs on the children's behalf, when their parents had not done so within the first year of their birth. They would probably have received a letter when the fund was set up, but may have ignored it or moved away. Typically, the fund is now worth Â£1,600. ""There should be a special effort from the government to re-link these [funds] to the young people to whom they belong,"" he said. HMRC has adedicated service to help people find out where their Child Trust Fund is held,external. The tax authority wrote to parents as their child became eligible for a Child Trust Fund and, after that, any communication should have been between them and the provider of the trust fund account.

"HM Revenue and Customs' reported policy of advising against giving honours to tax-avoiding celebrities has been backed by Sir Vince Cable. Celebrities who use lawful but controversial schemes are being ""blacklisted"" to protect the reputation of the honours list, saysthe Times,external. A Freedom of Information request showed a traffic light system was used to identify an individual's suitability. The Liberal Democrat leader said HMRC's tough stance was perfectly reasonable. Birthday Honours: Twelve famous faces Guide to the Honours ""The principle is right, I think the public is fed up with abusive tax avoidance by individuals and companies,"" Sir Vince told the BBC. He said: ""It seems perfectly reasonable to me that the Inland Revenue should be taking a tough line on tax avoidance."" Sir Vince, a former business secretary, added that some celebrities may ""wonder why they've been caught up in it"" as they may be unaware they have been involved in ""aggressive tax avoidance"" because accountants handle their affairs. HMRC analyses nominees for honours to check the risk of them being exposed over their tax affairs. The FOI response revealed that people are categorised as green if they are low risk, amber for medium risk and red for high risk. David Beckham is one of a number of celebrities who invested in a tax avoidance scheme which was successfully challenged by HMRC The list is then sent back to the Cabinet Office honours committee and the prime minister via secure email. An amber rating - given to individuals whose tax affairs would be ""likely to cause adverse comment"" - would damage their chance of receiving an honour, said the Times. It added that the system was a ""rare exception to the principle of taxpayer confidentiality"". A government spokesman said it was a ""longstanding policy... to protect the integrity of the system"". Last year, leaked emails appeared to reveal David Beckham's frustration at missing out on a knighthood in 2013. The 43-year-old was one of a number of celebrities who invested in a tax avoidance scheme which wassuccessfully challenged by HMRC. It is not known whether he was among the celebrities blocked by HMRC from receiving an honour as the Times describes. British honours are awarded on merit, for exceptional achievement or service. The honours list, announced twice a year, consists of knights and dames, appointments to the Order of the British Empire and gallantry awards to servicemen and women, and civilians. Anybody can nominate someone,externalliving in the UK that he or she judges to be deserving of an honour - but must provide a detailed explanation and submit two supporting letters. Whether someone gets an honour - and at what level - is decided by a committee specialising in that field (eg sport, business, education etc) which sends its recommendations to the main honours committee, and then on to the prime minister and the Queen. Read more here A document seen by the Times - which sets out the agreement between the Cabinet Office and HMRC - said that ""poor tax behaviour is not consistent with the award of an honour"". It continued: ""Trust would likely be lost if an honour was awarded to someone with negative tax behaviours and those behaviours became linked to the positive recognition that accompanies the award of an honour."" A government spokeswoman said: ""Honours are given to reward outstanding service in a given field or area and each nomination is rigorously assessed. ""As a matter of longstanding policy, in order to protect the integrity of the system, government departments which may have an interest in a particular nomination - including HMRC - are invited to contribute their views during this process."" Nominees who are approved for honours meet the Queen or another senior member of the Royal Family at an investiture ceremony This arrangement with HMRCwas already highlighted on the gov.uk website,externalwhen the Times put in an Freedom of Information request to the government in January to seek more details. Its question, submitted just after the publication of the New Year's Honours list, asked: ""What rules and/or guidance are there in the honours system regarding the awarding of honours to people with criminal convictions and/or other potential flaws in their character, such as cheating at sport, drug taking, offensive behaviour?"" The Cabinet Office refused to give the paper the information and argued releasing vetting agreements with HMRC and the police could hinder the system. Sir Vince said it was ""reprehensible"" that the government had resisted releasing the documents. He said he was ""surprised and disappointed"" by the government's actions, which showed ""it isn't too keen on transparency and that is clearly wrong"". After appealing to the Information Commissioner's Office, the Times was eventually given the documents. The Cabinet Office has, however, refused to give copies of letters and forms sent to lord lieutenants - the Queen's representative in each county - who also take part in the vetting process when someone from their area is nominated. Honours expert Richard Fitzwilliam said celebrities who may have been blacklisted over tax avoidance still deserved to be honoured for excelling in their particular fields as well as their charity work. ""No-one is condoning tax avoidance,"" the former editor of International Who's Who told the BBC. He said: ""There's nothing unlawful apparently in what has happened, clearly the honours system ought to take this into account.""

"More than 11,000 complaints have been made to media watchdog Ofcom about the Celebrity Big Brother ""punching"" episode.

During last night's show Ryan was seen approaching Roxanne in the kitchen before appearing to use his fist to make contact with her body. She said: ""Ouch that hurt, I was going to wash your clothes but I might shrink them now."" The actress made her name playing Jo Sugden in ITV soap Emmerdale After returning to the bedroom, the Emmerdale star added: ""Just been beaten up by Corrie's Jason Grimshaw. Big Brother that hurt."" Roxanne then entered the house's diary room where she demanded to speak to producers. ""Something that's just happened made me feel really uncomfortable,"" she said.

""I am now suffering and I am now having to alter my experience because someone was violent. Now I am going to get nominated for being unsociable,"" she said. Ryan Thomas starred in Coronation Street for 16 years Big Brother bosses then called Ryan to the diary room where they pointed out that while ""almost play fighting"" he ""punched Roxanne in the ribs"". He was reminded of the show's rules and given a formal warning for his behaviour. ""We both know and Roxanne knows there was no malice, hurt or anger in anything I did during this time. I am sorry and I understand,"" he said. The incident sparked a big debate on social media. Some argued Ryan was being playful and Roxanne was overreacting. Allow Twitter content?

"To procrastinate or not: the answer may be down to differences in how our brains are wired, a study suggests. It identified two areas of the brain that determine whether we are more likely to get on with a task or continually put it off. Researchers used a survey and scans of 264 people's brains to measure how proactive they were. Experts say the study, in Psychological Science, underlines procrastination is more about managing emotions than time. It found that the amygdala - an almond-shaped structure in the temporal (side) lobe which processes our emotions and controls our motivation - was larger in procrastinators. In these individuals, there were also poorer connections between the amygdala and a part of the brain called the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (DACC). The DACC uses information from the amygdala and decides what action the body will take. It helps keep the person on track by blocking out competing emotions and distractions. ""Individuals with a larger amygdala may be more anxious about the negative consequences of an action - they tend to hesitate and put off things,"" says Erhan GenÃ§, one of the study authors, based at Ruhr University Bochum. The researchers suggest that procrastinators are less able to filter out interfering emotions and distractions because the connections between the amygdala and the DACC in their brains are not as good as in proactive individuals. Prof Tim Pychyl, from Carleton University, Ottawa, who has beenstudying procrastination,externalfor the past few decades, believes it is a problem with managing emotions rather than time. ""This study provides physiological evidence of the problem procrastinators have with emotional control,"" he says. ""It shows how the emotional centres of the brain can overwhelm a person's ability for self-regulation."" Dr Pychyl is optimistic about the potential for change. He said: ""Research,externalhas already shown that mindfulness meditation is related to amygdala shrinkage, expansion of the pre-frontal cortex and a weakening of the connection between these two areas"". He said this showed that changing the brain was possible. Dr Caroline Schluter, the lead author of the study, said: ""The brain is very responsive and can change throughout the lifespan."" Productivity expert Moyra Scott thinks we need to take personality into account when motivating ourselves. ""We need to recognise when we are procrastinating and have 'tricks' we can employ to get us doing something,"" she said. Her top tips are: If you don't have an external deadline, use a timer to focus for set periods - for example, 25 minutes at a time with 5 minute breaks and a longer break every 90 minutes. Write a list of tasks but break it down into smaller, more specific ones. This makes them easier to action and complete. Try to minimise interruptions like email notifications. Putting your phone on airplane mode or going somewhere to work where you won't be disturbed will also help. Being ""busy"" is easier than doing the thing we are avoiding. Instead of doing the task at hand, we do other stuff instead and kid ourselves that we don't have the time. You do have the time. You just need to make it. Procrastination? I'll get back to you...

However, Dust speaks in Arabic, rather than Pashto or Dari, which are much more commonly spoken in Afghanistan. What's the difference between a hijab, niqab and burka?

Ms Alfageeh, who is an artist, said the positive reaction had been ""really exciting"". She said she had known she had ""nailed it"" when young Muslim women told her they identified with the outfits. ""I wanted to give Dust lots of attitude in my drawings."" she said. ""A woman who wears the niqab needs that attitude and thick skin just to walk down the street."" The images also started a conversation about the importance of ""diverse creators"" who were able to properly reflect the cultural backgrounds of characters. Allow Twitter content?

Ms Alfageeh agrees it's hard to represent different cultures authentically when those people aren't ""involved in the creative process"". Marvel has introduced more LGBT and ethnic minority characters in recent years, including Ms Marvel -a young Muslim woman. Ms Marvel has been well received by fans. And Ms Alfageeh agrees that the hero is an example of Marvel succeeding in representing minority groups with ""well written three-dimensional characters"".

"Social media is a crowded space for bloggers looking to make money from likes and follows, but for a select few, standing out means looking exactly the same. So what are the secrets behind a #twinning brand? Claire and Laura Jopson are not your typical travel bloggers. For one thing, they both hate flying. ""We startedTwins that Travel,externalbecause we hated travelling,"" Laura, 31, says. ""It was kind of an alter ego of someone I wasn't at that time - a confident traveller that goes around the world. Now, we travel - it was a strange lie that became reality."" A twin venture hasn't always been on the cards for the pair who now live 15 minutes apart near Milton Keynes. ""We meant to venture far from each other but we've failed,"" says Claire. The sisters started blogging in summer 2014 and originally did not appear in their social media posts, which then featured colourful landscape photography. But when a friend suggested a shift of focus - onto them - things changed. ""We forget the outside world sees us like that,"" Claire says, but ""once we started to push the twin thing, it became easier to establish ourselves."" Allow Instagram content?

Four years and thousands of air miles and followers later, the sisters are full-time bloggers with an impressive collection of awards to boot. They admit that as individuals, the blog ""wouldn't have gone anywhere"". ""We tried to be individuals our whole lives - we found [looking the same] embarrassing - but now embrace it because it's great,"" Laura says. They do still get embarrassed should they turn up in similar clothes, though. ""But brands like that,"" Claire says. ""They are always keen to play on the twin thing. 'Twin breaks' 'twin cities' - it's an easy hook - a marketing tool."" One-third of all twins will be identical All pregnant women have approximately the same chance of having identical twins - about 1 in 250 Identical (or monozygotic) twins happen when a single egg is fertilised and then splits in two Each baby will have the same genes and be the same sex There is no evidence that identical twins run in families In 2016, 10,786 women had twins (identical and non-identical) in England and Wales out of 696,271 total births Source: NHS, Office for National Statistics But what's it like working together? ""It's like a weird marriage,"" Laura says. ""We can fall out but 15 minutes later carry on where we left off. It's like having an insurance policy."" Claire agrees: ""There's no filter,"" she says, ""as twins we're bound together. We have to make up and carry on."" ""A picture of two girls is going to stand out more when we look more similar,"" says Jenny West. Make that a picture of twin bodybuilders in matching outfits captioned with a motivational message and you have a business model. Jenny and Lucy West -The West Twins,external- are figure competitors from Wigan and Stoke-on-Trent who, three years ago, decided to start sharing their fitness journey online.

""On holiday in 2015, Jenny introduced me to Instagram,"" says Lucy, now 31. The pair put up some holiday-themed posts and soon enough they were approached by a manager and a company ready to sponsor them. ""It took us by surprise. We didn't expect it. Our following grew rapidly,"" Lucy says. A year later, Lucy was self-employed and three years year on, the pair hit 300,000 followers. ""Being twins definitely helped us get noticed,"" Jenny says. ""We were the world's only fitness female twins when we started out."" Instagram stars: From influencers to entrepreneurs Are Instagram stars facing a brand backlash? The twins had always trained together and when Jenny did her first bodybuilding competition in 2014, Lucy followed suit. ""Lucy and I have always got on and always been interested in very similar things,"" says Jenny, who some will recognise from ITV2's reality entertainment show Survival of the Fittest. ""Now it's part of our job - to play on being twins. We're having too much fun to stop."" The sisters admit they probably argue more than your usual business partners, but have the ability to bounce back quicker too. ""We almost take turns with who's pushing,"" Lucy says. ""You have times when things get on top of you and one of us will be the driving force and step up for meetings or whatever. ""You don't switch off from it but I wouldn't change it for the world."" John (pictured left) and Tony Alberti have been working on their debut cook book called Twintastico The Alberti twins first hit our screens in 2015 on series one of Love Island. ""Being twins, we stood out and got exposure from that,"" says Tony Alberti. With that exposure, the self-proclaimed ""Italian stallions"" from Manchester launched a YouTube channel and blog and have grown a 280,000-strongInstagram following,external. ""We're different to your usual chefs,"" Tony, 33, says. ""We're really good looking and people are just fascinated by twins. We want to make cooking fun and sexy."" And the pair are rarely seen without each other. ""We were born twin so we make the most of it to our advantage,"" Tony says. ""People notice you a lot more - there's nobody out there like us,"" his brother John adds. The twins can charge thousands for an endorsement post, with brands happy to pay for the ""visually better"" image of the mirror chefs, says Tony. Allow Instagram content?

Their double image has also helped secure regular US and Canadian television appearances on morning programmes including NBC's Today Show. And the twinning isn't just for the cameras, (they signed off an email to me ""Yours twincerely"") as the brothers have lived together for the last 10 years, joking that it will remain that way until they find another pair of twins to marry. Loanne (R) and Jordan (L) are DJs and fashion and lifestyle bloggers Loanne and Jordan Collyer - originally from Bromley, south-east London - are the DJs-come models-come bloggers behindThe Collyer Twins,external. Their lifestyle blog began as a side project for Jordan during university. ""My sister graduated a year later [than me] and I said we should definitely do this together,"" Jordan says. ""The twin thing will make us stand out."" Sure enough, in an online community where filtered lives are 10-a-penny, the ""twin thing"" worked. Through constant posting, they started to make some money, and by mid-2016 they were blogging full-time. Serena, motherhood and Instagram pressure 'I tried 'Instagram face' for a week' Kylie Jenner tops Instagram rich list ""We were very lucky. Once we quit our full-time jobs, we got management which propelled us to a different level,"" says Jordan, 28. The pair now travel the world working with brands from Hunter to Asos, making sure their followers don't miss a minute. ""Whenever we work with brands, they want us both in the image... we can wear the same items but style them in different ways,"" Jordan explains. ""The pictures that do best are ones of us in matching bikinis and the same poses - when we play up to the twin thing. Same same, but different."" They began DJ-ing as another ""business opportunity"" - says Jordan - ""there's not that many female DJs, let alone twin DJs."" Twin photo rules: ""Loanne always on the right. Jordan always on left."" But it's not all business. Jordan loves being a twin. ""We like the same things. We're so similar in mannerisms - we finish each other's sentences,"" she says. ""We spend every single day together which is very intense, but we make it work. We're best friends but worst enemies too."" The pair have lived together in London for the last two years, although Jordan admits a move may be on the cards. ""There's no switch off,"" she says. The secret to their success? ""We had a good vision and we really nailed the twin thing. We knew that was our USP in such a saturated market. ""It's the twin power!""
