"Randox has pledged to expand the number of drop boxes and increase the frequency of collections One of the bigger providers of Covid PCR test kits has responded after images of overflowing drop boxes were shared online. The firm, Randox, said it was increasing the number of drop boxes and the frequency of box collections. The move comes after people posted pictures of returned test kits piled high on top of drop boxes in Sutton and Hampstead over the weekend. One MP said the ""pointless"" tests were ""becoming a bad joke"". At least one PCR test is required for all arrivals from international destinations within two days of landing in the UK. Those returning from green listed countries, or who are fully vaccinated and returning from amber list countries, are required to take only one. However, those not fully vaccinated from amber list destinations must take at least two tests, one on day two and one on day eight. One of those affected, Gavin Marshall, said he had to drop off a test kit on behalf of his daughter, who had completed a PCR test two days after returning from a holiday in Portugal. Despite the fact that the box was full, he said: ""I had no choice but to leave the sample at that site, because there wasn't enough time to get to another drop box before collection deadline."" Mr Marshall called it a ""Covid travel rip-off"". Javid urges review of excessive Covid test costs Rory Boland, Which? Travel Editor, said he had seen problems with several testing firms and an increase in every type of complaint. Complaints included tests not arriving on time, people being unable to book tests and misleading prices. ""It's particularly frustrating as Which? raised this with government a few months ago,"" he added. ""The system isn't set up for large numbers of people travelling and now many people are travelling the system is not working properly. The government might now say it is looking into the prices of tests, but it's very late in the day and these problems were foreseeable."" Labour MP Ben Bradshaw tweeted in reaction to the photos: ""These pointless rip-off day two PCR tests for people returning from amber and green list countries, most of which have a fraction of our Covid-19 rates, are becoming a bad joke."" A government spokesperson said health secretary Sajid Javidhad asked the competition watchdog to investigate excessive pricingand said it was working with testing providers to reduce costs. Nancy Diaz was due to fly to Barcelona on 21 July. When her test arrived, she registered it and delivered it to a Randox Health drop box in Edinburgh, two days before her flight. However, Ms Diaz said she only received confirmation that her test had arrived at the company's laboratory the following evening, meaning she knew her results were not going to come through in time for her flight. Due to the delay, Ms Diaz rebooked her flight for 24 hours later, however, when she received her negative test result at 13:26 BST on 21 July, the day she had originally planned to fly on, she was required to do another test at Edinburgh Airport as her original test results were now outside of the 72-hour window. ""I was given no refund, as they (Randox) claim the 24 hours promise is from when the test arrives at their lab, which can be whenever, apparently,"" said Ms Diaz. ""The fact that the test can take more than 24 hours to arrive to their lab was not mentioned."" Lizzy Merrall ordered tests for her parents and for herself on 19 July, ahead of a family holiday to Spain on 27 July. Her parents' tests arrived, but her pre-departure test she needed to take with her on holiday to do before flying back to the UK did not. ""I contacted Randox on the 26 July asking where my tests were,"" she told the BBC. ""I asked them if they could at least offer me a refund for one of the tests but they never replied to me and I had to pay Â£80 for a last minute test."" Ms Merrrall said her test pack only arrived once she was already on holiday in Spain. Randox has not responded to requests for comment in relation to Ms Diaz's and Ms Merrall's experiences. A spokesperson for the Northern Ireland-based company said it was ""constantly expanding and improving its Covid-19 testing capacity and associated logistics network, which is already the largest in the United Kingdom, to meet the rapidly growing demand resulting from the loosening of travel restrictions"". ""Randox continues to increase the number of drop boxes across the United Kingdom, which already totals over 200, and is increasing the frequency of box collections which are already occurring multiple times per day,"" they added. ""Randox is providing premium testing services in dynamic and rapidly changing circumstances and is committed to continuously improving its logistics network, to ensure that international travellers receive their results in time.  All of the sample kits pictured will be processed."" PCR tests are more expensive than lateral flow tests and have been criticised by some in the travel industry for pricing many potential travellers out. The government has previously defended their use, saying they are useful as they can be sequenced to check for variants of concern, unlike lateral flow tests. But some have criticised the government, saying they are not sequencing enough tests. Last week, Conservative MP Huw Merriman, chair of the Transport select committee, said they should be dropped. ""PCR tests can be two to three times the cost of lateral flow testing. It's pricing out holidays for those that don't have the means to pay for those tests,"" he said. ""I wouldn't mind if the tests were going to be used for sequencing, so we can find all variants of concern, but if only 5% of PCR tests are being sequenced, then surely it's a complete waste of money."" The Department for Health and Social Care (DHSC) has highlighted that as the vast majority of travellers into the UK do not test positive, their tests are not sent for sequencing. Of those sent for sequencing, a minority contain insufficient virus, but more than 95% of viable green and amber tests are sequenced, it said. A DHSC spokesperson said: ""All positive tests for arrivals from red list countries are sequenced and there is a legal requirement for private testing providers to sequence positive PCR tests for amber or green country travellers. ""We are already a world leader in genomics, with over 600,000 positive Covid-19 samples having been sequenced during this pandemic.""

"Afghan officials say security forces are still fighting in Kunduz At least 27 children have been killed in Afghanistan in three days amid fierce fighting between the Taliban and government forces, the UN has said. The UN children's agency Unicef said it was shocked by the ""rapid escalation of grave violations against children"". The Taliban have been making major advances across the country as foreign troops withdraw, taking six regional capitals since Friday. They have rejected international calls for a ceasefire. More than 1,000 civilians have been killed as a result of the conflict in the past month. In a statement on Monday, Unicef said the atrocities being committed against children were growing ""higher by the day"". The 27 fatalities were recorded across three provinces - Kandahar, Khost, and Paktia. Some 136 children were also injured in these areas over the past three days, Unicef said. ""Afghanistan has long been one of the worst places on Earth to be a child but in recent weeks and, indeed, the last 72 hours, that's got a lot worse,"" Unicef Afghanistan's Samantha Mort told the BBC. Children have been killed and injured in roadside bombs and in the crossfire. One mother told the group that her family were asleep over the weekend when their home was hit by shrapnel, which started a fire and left her 10-year-old son with ""horrific burns"". Many children are also sleeping outside after fleeing their homes. Unicef has called on all sides to ensure that children are protected. Violence has escalated across Afghanistan now that US-led forces have all but withdrawn following 20 years of military operations. The Taliban have rapidly captured large swathes of countryside, and are now targeting towns and cities. In their most significant gain since May, the Taliban are reported to have overrun the northern city of Kunduz. The city of 270,000 people is considered a gateway to mineral-rich northern provinces. It is in a strategically important location close to the border with Tajikistan, which is used for the smuggling of opium and heroin. It also holds symbolic significance for the Taliban because it was a key northern stronghold before 2001. The militants captured the city in 2015 and again in 2016 but have never been able to hold it for long. Afghan officials say security forces are still fighting in the city. This video can not be played The BBC's Yogita Limaye travelled to Afghanistan's Kunduz province in July The southwestern city of Zaranj was thefirst provincial capital to fall to the groupunder their sweeping offensive. The northern cities of Sheberghan, Sar-e-Pul, Taloqan and Aybak are now also reported to be under Taliban control. The insurgents entered Aybak, the capital of Samangan province, without a fight after community elders asked for the city to be spared more violence, deputy governor Sefatullah Samangani told AFP news agency. ""The governor accepted and withdrew all the forces from the city,"" he said. PROFILE:Who are the Taliban? ANALYSIS:How the Taliban retook half of Afghanistan FROM THE ARCHIVE:Kunduz, the city the Taliban seized Tolo News and Shamshad TV also tweeted that Afghan forces had retreated from the city without fighting. There was no immediate word from the armed forces. Elsewhere, US and Afghan planes have been carrying out airstrikes - the advance of the militants has not been halted, but Afghan officials say dozens of Taliban have died. Heavy fighting has been reported in Pul-e-Khumri and in Mazar-e-Sharif, a trading hub on the border with Uzbekistan. Army commanders say they have pushed back militants from its outskirts. On Monday morning a loud explosion was heard outside police headquarters in the southern city of Lashkar Gah, where the two sides have been fighting for more than a week. Residents said about 20 civilians had been killed in the past two days, and a school and a clinic destroyed. The capture of several cities and ongoing heavy fighting in others has led thousands of civilians to flee. Families, some including young children and pregnant women, have abandoned their homes and headed for the capital Kabul. The US Department of Defense on Monday said the security situation in Afghanistan was ""not going in the right direction"", but that Afghan security forces were capable of fighting the group. ""These are their military forces, these are their provincial capitals, their people to defend and it's really going to come down to the leadership that they're willing to exude here at this particular moment,"" spokesman John Kirby said. From 9/11, to intense fighting on the ground, and now full withdrawal of US-led forces, hereâs what happened. 11 September 2001 Al-Qaeda, led by Osama Bin Laden in Afghanistan, carries out the largest terror attack ever conducted on US soil. Four commercial airliners are hijacked. Two are flown into the World Trade Centre in New York, which collapses. One hits the Pentagon building in Washington, and one crashes into a field in Pennsylvania. Nearly 3,000 people are killed. 7 October 2001 A US-led coalition bombs Taliban and al-Qaeda facilities in Afghanistan. Targets include Kabul, Kandahar and Jalalabad. The Taliban, who took power after a decade-long Soviet occupation was followed by civil war, refuse to hand over Bin Laden. Their air defences and small fleet of fighter aircraft are destroyed. 13 November 2001 The Northern Alliance, a group of anti-Taliban rebels backed by coalition forces, enters Kabul as the Taliban flee the city. By the 13 November 2001, all Taliban have either fled or been neutralised. Other cities quickly fall. 26 January 2004 After protracted negotiations at a “loya jirga” or grand assembly, the new Afghan constitution is signed into law. The constitution paves the way for presidential elections in October 2004. 7 December 2004 Hamid Karzai, the leader of the Popalzai Durrani tribe, becomes the first president under the new constitution. He serves two five-year terms as president. May 2006 British troops arrive in Helmand province, a Taliban stronghold in the south of the country. Their initial mission is to support reconstruction projects, but they are quickly drawn into combat operations. More than 450 British troops lose their lives in Afghanistan over the course of the conflict. 17 February 2009 US President Barack Obama approves a major increase in the number of troops sent to Afghanistan. At their peak, they number about 140,000. The so-called “surge” is modelled on US strategy in Iraq where US forces focussed on protecting the civilian population as well as killing insurgent fighters. 2 May 2011 The leader of al-Qaeda is killed in an assault by US Navy Seals on a compound in Abbottabad in Pakistan. Bin Ladenâs body is removed and buried at sea. The operation ends a 10-year hunt led by the CIA. Â The confirmation that Bin Laden had been living on Pakistani soil fuels accusations in the US that Pakistan is an unreliable ally in the war on terror. 23 April 2013 The founder of the Taliban, Mullah Mohammed Omar, dies. His death is kept secret for more than two years. According to Afghan intelligence, Mullah Omar dies of health problems at a hospital in the Pakistani city of Karachi. Pakistan denies that he was in the country. 28 December 2014 At a ceremony in Kabul, Nato ends its combat operations in Afghanistan. With the surge now over, the US withdraws thousands of troops. Â Most of those who remain focus on training and supporting the Afghan security forces. 2015 The Taliban launch a series of suicide attacks, car bombings and other assaults. The parliament building in Kabul, and the city of Kunduz are attacked. Islamic State militants begin operations in Afghanistan. 25 January 2019 Afghan President Ashraf Ghani says more than 45,000 members of his countryâs security forces have been killed since he became leader in 2014. The figure is far higher than previously thought. 29 February 2020 The US and the Taliban sign an “agreement for bringing peace” to Afghanistan, in Doha, Qatar. The US and Nato allies agree to withdraw all troops within 14 months if the militants uphold the deal. 13 April 2021 US president Joe Biden announces that all US troops will leave Afghanistan by 11 September 2021. 16 August 2021 In just over a month, the Taliban sweep across Afghanistan, taking control of towns and cities all over the country, including Kabul.

As a result, services from Motherwell, Whifflet, Larkhall and Cumbernauld will be affected while trains from Helensburgh to Edinburgh will be diverted via Singer. The rail line at Dalmuir, West Dunbartonshire, was submerged under water Separately, flooding between Hillfoot and Bearsden meant services were unable to operate to and from Milngavie. Earlier on Monday, train speed restrictions were in place in Edinburgh, between Aberdeen and Inverness and between Dunkeld/Birnam and Blair Atholl. The Met Office said parts of Scotland could see 15-30mm of rainfall in a short space of time, or as much as 50-70mm over several hours.

"Mr Woodhouse declined to comment on the investigation A major investigation has been launched into property developer entrepreneur Gavin Woodhouse. It will focus on investments he offered in care homes and hotels, some of which were in Wales, between 2013 and 2019. The Serious Fraud Office (SFO) said it is investigating ""suspected fraud and money laundering"" relating to him, as well as associated individuals and firms. Mr Woodhouse declined to comment on the investigation. UK-based investors into the suspected fraudulent schemes were being urged to completean SFO questionnaire,external. It said this would ""help us to establish the circumstances of the investments offered, to identify and pursue new information, and to progress the investigation as quickly as possible"".

Derrick Towlson invested in the Fourcroft Hotel in Tenby, Pembrokeshire Derrick Towlson, from Llysfaen in Conwy, invested in a room at the Fourcroft Hotel in Tenby in 2017 after selling his business. His Â£75,000 was supposed to fund the hotel's renovation and in return he would be paid an annual rental. He was told he could then sell his room back after 10 years at 25% profit. Investor Derrick Towlson says he lost Â£75,000 ""I've worked hard since the age of 15 and never had a day out of work so that I could retire early, now we've lost almost everything,"" he told BBC Wales. ""For the first time in our lives we've had to go on universal credit because our savings are depleted. ""We had nowhere to live so we moved in with my 90-year-old mother. It's been really hard."" Gary Thomas, who invested in two rooms at the Queen's Hotel in Llandudno, welcomed the SFO's investigation. The retired financial advisor from Flintshire did receive a return on his investments for a couple of years, but these dried up in 2018 and he said he was about Â£75,000 out of pocket. ""I'm pleased the Serious Fraud Office are investigating this,"" Mr Thomas said. An artist's impression of what the resort could have looked like ""The Queen's is up for sale and we're waiting to see what will happen if it sells, whether they buy the rooms from us or offer us an income. ""I just want out, really. I want to draw a line under this and move on."" Concerns were raised about unfinished projects and the finances of Mr Woodhouse's Northern Powerhouse Developments (NPD) companies. In 2019, a High Court judge put Northern Powerhouse Developments Ltd into administration, ruling that Mr Woodhouse's business model appeared to be ""thoroughly dishonest"" and a ""shameful abuse of the privileges of limited liability trading"". BBC Wales revealed in November 2019that a number of Welsh hotels were being offered for sale following the collapse of the NPD schemes to try to get some money back for investors, many of whom were told that the Land Registry documents relating to their purchases were likely to be worthless. Law firm Penningtons Manches Cooper are pursuing professional negligence claims against a number of solicitors who advised investors in the NPD schemes. Penningtons partner David Niven said the firm was representing ""hundreds of clients"" in respect of investments totalling about Â£20m, including some who invested in Welsh hotels and the Afan Valley Adventure Resort scheme as well as hotels and care homes in England.

"Art of Zero Living store owner Vita Viskackaite fills a jar with organic rice from a dispenser In 2017, National Trust colleagues Stacey Fordham, 43, and Lidia Rueda Losada, 37, had a casual chat about how they wished everything they bought wasn't packaged in so much plastic. The conversation spurred an idea to open a shop selling food and household items entirely without packaging, and in March 2018 they took the plunge. They opened Zero Green, believed to be the second store in the country and first in Bristol. Zero Green sells more than 1,000 product lines: including pasta, grains and pulses in dispensers; frozen vegan pasties; eco-cleaning products; cosmetics and sustainable non-plastic toiletries. Consumers are encouraged to bring their own containers or use recycled jars and packaging to take their shopping home. Seven days without single-use plastic 'Clothes should float in and out of our lives' Plastic impact of pandemic 'will last forever' ""We put in just over Â£30,000 to start from our own savings,"" says Ms Fordham, who also previously worked for Sainsbury's. Lidia Rueda Losada and Stacey Fordham met while working at the National Trust's head office in Swindon ""You have to really believe in what you're doing in order to do this, otherwise it's very hard."" The UK's first organic zero-waste shop was Earth.Food.Love in Totnes, set up by former Manchester United footballer Richard Eckersley and his wife Nicola in 2017. The pioneering couple are credited by the zero-waste community with sharing how they established their business, offering full supplier lists, business plans and pricing lists for free, online. Ms Fordham and Ms Rueda Losada used their tips. But there was a lot of trial and error, they say, plus additional challenges as they were determined to live by their green principles. ""It was really important for us to not buy virgin wood or racking off a shelf - everything we used in the shop was upcycled. ""We went to electrical companies and got big cable drums, upcycled pallets and salvaged scaffolding boards,"" says Ms Fordham. They were ""really lucky"", she adds, as within six months Zero Green had broken even and eventually moved to a retail space four times bigger. Zero Green's owners say they have followed their principles in their business, including using recycled materials for shop fixtures ""The popularity of it all was more than we expected... demand was so high we physically couldn't fit people into the shop."" Before the pandemic, the store was taking in Â£12,000 a week in sales, but now revenues have fallen by two thirds and they have had to lay off half their staff. The online community of zero-waste shop owners estimates there are now roughly 320 zero-waste shops in the UK, but this also includes community interest companies (CICs) and organic wholefood shops. According to consumer expert Kate Hardcastle, it is difficult to collect official data because many shops go bust and fail. However, the community is growing steadily online and free advice is given to new entrepreneurs ona popular Facebook group,external. Vita Viskackaite, 43, opened the Art of Zero Living store in Greenwich, London, in April. She left a successful career in logistics with restaurant chain Itsu to run the shop, while her partner Justas pays the bills with his earnings. They have invested Â£55,000 from savings. Vita Viskackaite: ""My husband said 'why don't you open your own shop?'"" ""Two years ago, I read a book called Zero Waste Home by Bea Johnson and it captured me, as it wasn't just about saving the environment - it was also about saving money and improving your life,"" she says. Inspired, Ms Viskackaite got rid of 30% of everything she owned and began shopping at a zero-waste shop in north London, but she had to take two buses each way to do her weekly shopping. ""Then coronavirus came and I was very sad because I didn't have anyone locally to buy from,"" she says. ""So, my husband said to me, 'If you feel so strongly about this, why don't you open your own shop?'"" In June, the couple made Â£10,000 in sales. After paying Â£9,000 in overheads including stock and rent, they have a Â£1,000 profit. ""I hope that one day, there will be many more people who join the zero-waste lifestyle and avoid buying products using single-use plastic just because it's convenient,"" stresses Ms Viskackaite. ""We were never planning to become rich out of this, we just wanted to have peace of mind."" Research from environmental consultancy, Eunomia, shows mean annual turnover for EU zero-waste shops is around â¬170,000 (Â£144,000) based on a sample size of 268 packaging-free shops in 10 EU countries. And there is evidence shop turnover has increased over the past three years. Burgess Hill mayor Anne Eves and council leader Robert Eggleston are trying to encourage more green businesses ""Covid has jolted social consciousness, a retailer told me,"" says Ms Hardcastle. ""In our survey of 140 people, 85% of people said they care more about the environment than they did 12 months ago."" In Sussex, Burgess Hill mayor Anne Eves and council leader Robert Eggleston say there is definitely a movement to rejuvenate high streets with green businesses, like zero-waste shops and eco-fashion retailers. Since being elected in 2019, they have negotiated rent reductions with commercial landlords and divided up large empty retail units. Start-ups pay lower rents and some avoid business rates altogether. ""We want to nurture these businesses. At some point they will spread their wings and fly, and we want to support them so they have a chance,"" says Mr Eggleston. Ms Eves, a Green councillor, says sustainability matters a lot to her constituents. She set upa monthly repair cafeto help people fix their electronic gadgets, clothes and bedding that has been very popular, and thinks every High Street should have one. ""We are gradually changing things... we'd like to see this town thriving as it was 20 years ago."" Architecture graduate Lydia Wilson, 26, started Waste Not Want Not in Bridport, Dorset, three years ago. ""I wanted something which enabled people to live waste-free but also [to] start a conversation on a much wider scale on ethics and organic living,"" she says. Lydia Wilson says she has learned a lot from her community and it has given her crucial support Ms Wilson took out Â£45,000 in personal loans to start her business. She offers more than 700 products and her biggest customer base is in the 35-50s age group. It took 18 months for her to break even. Prior to Covid she took Â£12,000 a year in salary, but now everything is being ploughed back into the store. She says the journey has been really hard, running the business all by herself, and is thankful that her customers have rallied round. ""I know now that I've got a community of people who really want the shop to be here, and would do what they could to make sure the shop stays. ""That's something I might call upon - it's a limited company but I want to transition it into a community benefit society or a co-operative."" Ms Fordham and Ms Viskackaite both agree that their communities are crucial. Lydia Wilson says providing a space for her customers to be heard and exchange ideas is crucial ""I've learned it's OK to ask for help and be honest and open with your customers and staff,"" says Ms Fordham. ""Coming from the big bad business world you never admitted those things, but it's lovely to get advice and help."" However, there are not yet enough such businesses to enable consumers to ""shop economically"" in the UK and many consumers lack information about them, stresses Ms Hardcastle. Yet she still thinks zero-waste shops have an edge on supermarkets, some of which are now trialling similar ideas. ""The community is incredibly important to the success of zero waste shops and difficult to replicate,"" she says. ""Is it a sustainable business model? Yes because interest is beginning to grow but it has to be run by people who are committed to the cause.""

"The Ratcliffe-on-Soar power station in Nottinghamshire is one of Britain's two remaining coal-fired power stations Coal needs to be consigned to history to limit global warming, says PM Boris Johnson, describing a UN report on climate change as ""sobering"". He said the world must shift to clean energy and provide finance to help countries at risk from changing climates. Thelandmark studyfound it was ""unequivocal"" that human activity was responsible for global warming. Green campaigners said the UK must halt planned new fossil fuel projects. Despite the call to end the use of coal, the UK is considering plans for a new coking coal mine in Cumbria, as well as proposals to tap a new oil field near Shetland. The report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) - the UN group on the science of climate change - said climate change was already here and causing chaos in some places. Its authors said some of the changes, including rising sea levels, would not be reversed for hundreds or maybe thousands of years. The publication comes less than three months before the UK hosts a key climate summit, known as COP26, in Glasgow. Climate report is 'code red for humanity' Follow live reaction to climate report A really simple guide to climate change Five things we have learned from IPCC report Mr Johnson said: ""Today's report makes for sobering reading, and it is clear that the next decade is going to be pivotal to securing the future of our planet. ""We know what must be done to limit global warming - consign coal to history and shift to clean energy sources, protect nature and provide climate finance for countries on the frontline."" The UK government, whichhas adopted a 2035 deadline for a 78% emissions cut,is due to publish its strategy on cutting UK emissions to zero overall by 2050 this autumn. Net zero means cutting carbon emissions as far as possible then balancing out any remaining releases, for example by tree planting. ""The UK is leading the way, decarbonising our economy faster than any country in the G20 over the last two decades,"" the prime minister said. ""I hope today's IPCC report will be a wake-up call for the world to take action now, before we meet in Glasgow in November for the critical COP26 summit."" The UK has already drastically reduced the use of coal, with consumption falling from 61 million tonnes in 2013 to eight million tonnes last year. But the country remains dependent on other fossil fuels such as natural gas, which provides most home heating and about 40% of electricity. The Climate Change Committee, the UK's independent adviser on tackling global warming, saysthe UK has adequate policies for only two of 21 key areas,externalin eliminating carbon emissions. The government faces challenges both on the international stage and closer to home. The biggest will be to persuade the international community to sign up to meaningful measures in Glasgow at COP26. Some 70% of the world's economy has signed up to a net zero target - ministers want that to be higher. They are looking at the G20 in particular to drive change. At home, an increasing number of Tory MPs are worried about the cost of the UK's own targets. Will the infrastructure be in place to support the mass use of electric cars? Who will pay for more expensive boilers in homes? Answering some of those concerns won't be easy. The Treasury is said to be aware of the need to avoid ""extortionate costs"" for low-income families. Ministers want to bring costs down through investment, incentives and mass production. But the specifics will matter to our pockets and our politics. The report said the world would reach or exceed temperature rises of 1.5C - seen as a threshold beyond which the worst impacts of global warming will be felt - over the next two decades. Almost every nation on Earth signed up to the goals of the Paris climate agreement in 2015, which aims to keep the rise in global temperatures well below 2C this century and to pursue efforts to keep it under 1.5C. Alok Sharma, COP26 president, said one of the key messages of the report was that ""the future is not yet written"" and 1.5C was still an achievable goal, although retreating fast. This video can not be played Alok Sharma says ""we need far more in terms of action"" He said based on the conversations he had had, there was ""a clear desire"" among governments to ""keep the 1.5C within reach"". But he said far more was needed in terms of action, adding ""the cost of inaction on climate change is far greater than the cost of action"". Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the report confirmed that the extreme weather events in recent months were ""only going to become more frequent"" and urgent action was needed. ""The biggest threat we now face is not climate denial but climate delay,"" he said. ""Those who, like our prime minister, acknowledge there is a problem, but simply don't have the scale of ambition required to match the moment. ""Our communities and planet can no longer afford the inaction of this government, who are failing to treat the crisis with the seriousness it deserves."" This video can not be played Sir Keir Starmer calls for a ""coalition of countries"" ahead of COP26 to tackle climate change. Labour wants to seea Â£30bn investment in low-carbon industryto support 400,000 jobs. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon told ITV's Good Morning Britain she would be writing to the prime minister to encourage more co-operation between the devolved UK governments in light of the IPCC publication, which she described as ""a grim wake-up call"". But climate campaigners, Scottish Greens and Scottish Labour have called on her to oppose plans to extract more fossil fuels from the Cambo oil field near Shetland, which they said would result in the release of an estimated 135 million extra tonnes of carbon in its lifetime. Minister urges Tory MPs to back PM's climate plan Second-to-last coal-fired power station to close How serious is the government about COP26? The SNP has maintained that the issue is solely a matter for the UK government. The UK government also faced criticism after initially opting not to intervene in a company's plans for a new coking coal mine in Cumbria. It later reversed the decision and a minister will have the final say on the project, after a public inquiry is held next month. This video can not be played BBC Reality Check explains how to cut your carbon footprint Friends of the Earth climate campaigner Tony Bosworth said the prime minister's pledge to consign coal to history ""should mean all coal"" and the prime minister must make clear the mine will not be allowed. Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey said that as hosts of COP26, the UK needs to lead the world in tackling the climate crisis but ""Boris Johnson's dither and delay is costing us time we cannot afford, with drastic consequences"". Green Party Deputy Leader Amelia Womack said ""this must be the moment the government finally realises we are in an emergency"", urging the introduction of a global carbon tax as ""the most powerful way of rapidly eliminating fossil fuels"". Coal mine plan to be re-examined Climate change, a coalmine and a town that needs jobs Climate scientist Dr Michael Byrne, a contributing author to the report, said the study was ""particularly significant"" as it was the first to link extreme weather events to human activities. ""That evidence was inconclusive back in 2013, at the time of the previous IPCC report; now it's irrefutable."" He said to slow and stop global warming, emissions of greenhouse gases needed to be ""rapidly reduced"" to net zero, but he added: ""The UK and Scottish targets of net zero by 2050 and 2045 are not fast enough, we have to be more ambitious. ""Let's hope our political leaders, as they gear up to COP26 in Glasgow this November, take heed.""

"Former Prime Minister David Cameron made about Â£3.3m from shares in the collapsed finance company Greensill Capital, documents obtained by BBC Panorama suggest. Last month an MPs' report accused Mr Cameron of ""a significant lack of judgement"" in lobbying the government on behalf of the company, although it said he did not break any rules. In 2020, Mr Cameron tried to persuade ministers to allow Greensill - who employed him as an adviser - to join a scheme called the Corporate Covid Financing Facility (CCFF). This would have allowed the company to issue loans, insured by the government, to help firms through the pandemic. However, Mr Cameron - and the company's founder, Lex Greensill - were unsuccessful in their attempts. Greensill Capital collapsed this year, with the loss of 440 jobs, and possible billion-pound losses for investors. Mr Cameron has consistently declined to say how much he was being paid by Greensill, except that it was ""far more"" than his salary as PM. However, BBC's Panorama has obtained a letter from Greensill Capital to the former PM which suggests that he made Â£3.29m after selling a tranche of Greensill shares in 2019. David Cameron 'made $10m' before company's collapse As well as the shares, Mr Cameron is reported to have received a salary of $1m (Â£720,000) a year as a part-time adviser. The programme also understands that the former prime minister was paid a bonus of $700,000 (Â£504,000) in 2019 on top of his salary. In total, it looks like he made around $10m before tax for two-and-a-half years' part-time work. Mr Cameron's spokesman said his remuneration was a private matter. Australian banker Lex Greensill originally worked for David Cameron at No 10 in the early 2010s Mr Cameron has been accused of trying to exploit private contacts with former government colleagues, for his own benefit. The former PM used private channels,externalto lobby ministers and former colleagues. He and his staff sent45 emails, texts and WhatsApp messagesconcerning Greensill between 5 March and 26 June 2020. Among these were nine WhatsApp messages to Chancellor Rishi Sunak and 12 text messages to Sir Tom Scholar, the Treasury's top civil servant. The Bank of England haspublished correspondence,externalshowing that Mr Cameron had contacted senior officials several times, in an unsuccessful attempt to win their support. Along with Lex Greensill, Mr Cameron met Health Secretary Matt Hancock for a ""private drink"" in 2019to discuss a new payment scheme for NHS staff. A report last month by the House of Commons Treasury Select Committee said that while no lobbying rules were broken, Mr Cameron's actions showed there was a ""good case for strengthening them"", with the current ones offering ""insufficient strength"". It also said that the Treasury was right to reject the former PM's proposals, but it ""should have encouraged"" him into ""more formal lines of communication as soon as it had identified his personal financial incentives"". ACabinet Office reviewcommissioned by Boris Johnson also criticised Mr Cameron, and said he had understated his relationship with Greensill when lobbying the Treasury. However, it said that ""his actions were not unlawful"". Several other reviews are investigating matters related to lobbying and Greensill. Responding to the Treasury Committee report, Mr Cameron admitted that he should have used more formal channels, but said he had worked for Greensill primarily because he thought the firm could help small businesses during an economic crisis. However, Deputy Labour Leader Angela Rayner said the fact that Mr Cameron had been cleared of breaking rules proved ""that the rules that are supposed to regulate lobbying are completely unfit for purpose"". Current rules,externalstate that ""on leaving office, ministers will be prohibited from lobbying government for two years"". Before accepting new jobs, former ministers are supposed to inform a body called the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments (Acoba). Acoba advises civil servants and politicians on what they can and can't do after leaving public service. However, although former ministers are required to contact Acoba, they are not obliged to act on its advice. Acoba's head, Lord Pickles, has called for ex-ministers who work as lobbyiststo go on a register for up to 10 years to ensure ""transparency"", The company's collapse earlier this year was triggered after its insurer refused to renew cover for the loans Greensill was making. Greensill was theprincipal financial backer of Liberty Steel, which employs 3,000 people in England, Scotland and Wales. Talks are now underwayto try to secure Liberty's future.

"David Cameron showed a ""significant lack of judgement"" in the way he lobbied the government on behalf of Greensill Capital, a report has found. The Treasury committee also questioned the former prime minister's judgement on the financial health of the now-collapsed lending firm. The report comes after Mr Cameron was found to have lobbied for Greensill bysending texts to the chancellor. Mr Cameron said he acted in good faith but there were ""lessons to be learnt"". The Treasury committee said that while Mr Cameron did not break the rules over lobbying by former ministers, there was a ""good case for strengthening them"", with the current ones offering ""insufficient strength"". What's the David Cameron lobbying row about? Clock ticking on Gupta's fight to save his empire The committee concluded Mr Cameron's ""less formal means"" to lobby the government to help Greensill, where he was an advisor, were ""aided by his previous position of prime minister"". They added had he ""taken a broader and more enquiring assessment of the business"", there were ""signals available"" which might have led him to take a ""more restrained approach"" when asking the government to help the firm. Mel Stride, chair of the Treasury committee, said the Treasury ""should have encouraged"" Mr Cameron into ""more formal lines of communication as soon as it had identified his personal financial incentives"". He added: ""However, the Treasury took the right decision to reject the objectives of his lobbying, and the committee found that Treasury ministers and officials behaved with complete and absolute integrity."" At the start of the coronavirus pandemic the government said it would back loans to large companies struggling in lockdown. Greensill Capital,which has since collapsed, made seven loans totalling Â£350m to companies owned by Sanjeev Gupta's business empire, GFG Alliance, which included Liberty Steel, the UK's third-largest steel manufacturer which employs 3,000 people. It was revealed in March, that when advising Greensill, the former prime minister texted Conservative ministers within the Treasury to appeal for access to emergency loans for the finance firm, but the requests were rejected. Mr Cameron has been cleared of breaking any rules over his lobbying, however critics have continued to question his access to ministers. The Treasury committee said the ""central argument"" for Greensill's attempt to gain access to government support was ""more of a sales pitch than a reality"". The committee acknowledged Treasury officials and ministers behaved properly in their handling of Mr Cameron's lobbying, and ""took the right decision"" in preventing Greensill from accessing the Covid Corporate Financing Facility. However, they added members were ""very surprised"" by the Treasury's claim that Mr Cameron's former position had no meaningful effect on how Greensill's application for access to the CCFF was dealt with. ""Mr Cameron was an ex-prime minister, who had worked with those he was lobbying and had access to their mobile phone numbers,"" the committee said. ""The committee believes that the Treasury's unwillingness to accept that it could have made any better choices in how it engaged in this case is a missed opportunity for reflection."" In response to the report, Mr Cameron said: ""While I am pleased that the report confirms I broke no rules, I very much take on board its wider points. ""I always acted in good faith, and had no idea until the end of last year that Greensill Capital was in danger of failure. ""However, I have been clear all along that there are lessons to be learnt. As I said to the committee, I accept that communications of this nature should be done in future through only the most formal of channels. ""I agree that the guidance on how former ministers engage with government could be updated and was pleased to provide some suggestions on this to the committee."" A Treasury spokesman said: ""This report is clear that the Treasury was right to consider Greensill's proposals, right to ultimately reject their proposals, and concludes that the Treasury behaved with absolute integrity throughout the process."" Deputy Labour leader Angela Rayner said Mr Cameron being cleared of breaking any rules ""proves that the rules that are supposed to regulate lobbying are completely unfit for purpose"".

"Former Prime Minister David Cameron has been cleared by a watchdog looking at whether he engaged in lobbying for which he should have been registered. The Registrar of Consultant Lobbyists investigated after reports he had contacted officials on behalf of financial firm Greensill Capital. It concluded that Mr Cameron's activities had not fallen within the criteria that required registration. The contact is said to have taken place after Mr Cameron was prime minister. On Wednesday, a source close to him said he was exempt from the register as he had been an in-house employee for Greensill. The company, which collapsed earlier this month, was a key backer of UK giant Liberty Steel.

"Environmentalist Greta Thunberg called for a ""system change"" in the fashion industry Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg has condemned the fashion industry over its ""huge"" contribution to climate change, in a magazine interview. Ms Thunberg told Vogue Scandinavia that fashion brands needed to take responsibility for the environmental impact of their products. In a tweet, she accused some companies of ""greenwash"" ad campaigns designed to make their clothes appear sustainable. Vogue Scandinavia,externalfeatured Ms Thunberg, 18, on the cover of its first issue. In the interview, Ms Thunberg said she last bought a new item of clothing three years ago and ""it was second-hand"". ""I just borrow things from people I know,"" Ms Thunberg said. On Sunday she tweeted a picture of Vogue Scandinavia's front cover, which showed her wearing an oversized trench coat while petting a horse in a forest. Allow Twitter content?

In the tweet Ms Thunberg - one of the world's best-known climate campaigners - criticised ""fast fashion that many treat as disposables"". The term ""fast fashion"" is used to describe the rapid, low-cost production of clothing to service demand for seasonal trends. Calling for a ""system change"", Ms Thunberg said fashion could not be mass produced and consumed ""sustainably as the world is shaped today"". The United Nations says the fashion industry is ""widely believed to be the second-most polluting industry in the world"". It accounts formore than 20% of wastewater globally, the UN says.,externalAbout 93bn cubic metres of water - enough for five million people to survive - is used by the fashion industry every year. As for carbon emissions, the industry is responsible for about 8% of the total worldwide. That's more than all international flights and shipping combined, the UN says. In response to this, fashion brands have started to take action to reduce their environmental footprint. But environmental campaigners like Ms Thunberg say many of these brands are promoting solutions that only appear to address the problem. These companies are often accused of greenwashing, which is a form of marketing spin designed to mislead consumers about the environmental merits of a product. Who is Greta Thunberg and what are her aims? Known for her impassioned speeches, Ms Thunberg has become a figurehead for the global climate change movement. Her solo protest outside Sweden's parliament in 2018 inspired millions of young people to join her school climate strike campaign, Fridays for Future.

"Environmentalist Greta Thunberg called for a ""system change"" in the fashion industry Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg has condemned the fashion industry over its ""huge"" contribution to climate change, in a magazine interview. Ms Thunberg told Vogue Scandinavia that fashion brands needed to take responsibility for the environmental impact of their products. In a tweet, she accused some companies of ""greenwash"" ad campaigns designed to make their clothes appear sustainable. Vogue Scandinavia,externalfeatured Ms Thunberg, 18, on the cover of its first issue. In the interview, Ms Thunberg said she last bought a new item of clothing three years ago and ""it was second-hand"". ""I just borrow things from people I know,"" Ms Thunberg said. On Sunday she tweeted a picture of Vogue Scandinavia's front cover, which showed her wearing an oversized trench coat while petting a horse in a forest. Allow Twitter content?

In the tweet Ms Thunberg - one of the world's best-known climate campaigners - criticised ""fast fashion that many treat as disposables"". The term ""fast fashion"" is used to describe the rapid, low-cost production of clothing to service demand for seasonal trends. Calling for a ""system change"", Ms Thunberg said fashion could not be mass produced and consumed ""sustainably as the world is shaped today"". The United Nations says the fashion industry is ""widely believed to be the second-most polluting industry in the world"". It accounts formore than 20% of wastewater globally, the UN says.,externalAbout 93bn cubic metres of water - enough for five million people to survive - is used by the fashion industry every year. As for carbon emissions, the industry is responsible for about 8% of the total worldwide. That's more than all international flights and shipping combined, the UN says. In response to this, fashion brands have started to take action to reduce their environmental footprint. But environmental campaigners like Ms Thunberg say many of these brands are promoting solutions that only appear to address the problem. These companies are often accused of greenwashing, which is a form of marketing spin designed to mislead consumers about the environmental merits of a product. Who is Greta Thunberg and what are her aims? Known for her impassioned speeches, Ms Thunberg has become a figurehead for the global climate change movement. Her solo protest outside Sweden's parliament in 2018 inspired millions of young people to join her school climate strike campaign, Fridays for Future. Since then, she has received Nobel Peace Prize nominations and travelled across the Atlantic on a yacht to attend a UN climate conference in New York.

"Mr Woodhouse declined to comment on the investigation A major investigation has been launched into property developer entrepreneur Gavin Woodhouse. It will focus on investments he offered in care homes and hotels, some of which were in Wales, between 2013 and 2019. The Serious Fraud Office (SFO) said it is investigating ""suspected fraud and money laundering"" relating to him, as well as associated individuals and firms. Mr Woodhouse declined to comment on the investigation. UK-based investors into the suspected fraudulent schemes were being urged to completean SFO questionnaire,external. It said this would ""help us to establish the circumstances of the investments offered, to identify and pursue new information, and to progress the investigation as quickly as possible"". More than 1,000 people, including many overseas investors, have thought to have invested about Â£80 million in companies owned by Mr Woodhouse. When Enron collapsed: The dark side of business The crypto scam costing life-savings The Lazarus Heist: How How North Korea almost pulled off a billion-dollar hack Those taking part in the schemes handed over cash for hotel rooms, ""off-plan"" care home rooms and unbuilt lodges on the proposed Afan Valley Adventure Resort in south Wales. Neath Port Talbot Council said Mr Woodhouse was ""no longer involved"" in the Afan Valley project, and the new applicant hoped to ""drive this development forward"". Derrick Towlson invested in the Fourcroft Hotel in Tenby, Pembrokeshire Derrick Towlson, from Llysfaen in Conwy, invested in a room at the Fourcroft Hotel in Tenby in 2017 after selling his business. His Â£75,000 was supposed to fund the hotel's renovation and in return he would be paid an annual rental. He was told he could then sell his room back after 10 years at 25% profit. Investor Derrick Towlson says he lost Â£75,000 ""I've worked hard since the age of 15 and never had a day out of work so that I could retire early, now we've lost almost everything,"" he told BBC Wales. ""For the first time in our lives we've had to go on universal credit because our savings are depleted. ""We had nowhere to live so we moved in with my 90-year-old mother. It's been really hard."" Gary Thomas, who invested in two rooms at the Queen's Hotel in Llandudno, welcomed the SFO's investigation. The retired financial advisor from Flintshire did receive a return on his investments for a couple of years, but these dried up in 2018 and he said he was about Â£75,000 out of pocket. ""I'm pleased the Serious Fraud Office are investigating this,"" Mr Thomas said. An artist's impression of what the resort could have looked like ""The Queen's is up for sale and we're waiting to see what will happen if it sells, whether they buy the rooms from us or offer us an income. ""I just want out, really. I want to draw a line under this and move on."" Concerns were raised about unfinished projects and the finances of Mr Woodhouse's Northern Powerhouse Developments (NPD) companies. In 2019, a High Court judge put Northern Powerhouse Developments Ltd into administration, ruling that Mr Woodhouse's business model appeared to be ""thoroughly dishonest"" and a ""shameful abuse of the privileges of limited liability trading"". BBC Wales revealed in November 2019that a number of Welsh hotels were being offered for sale following the collapse of the NPD schemes to try to get some money back for investors, many of whom were told that the Land Registry documents relating to their purchases were likely to be worthless. Law firm Penningtons Manches Cooper are pursuing professional negligence claims against a number of solicitors who advised investors in the NPD schemes. Penningtons partner David Niven said the firm was representing ""hundreds of clients"" in respect of investments totalling about Â£20m, including some who invested in Welsh hotels and the Afan Valley Adventure Resort scheme as well as hotels and care homes in England. The SFO would not comment further on its investigation but said its core purpose were to ""deliver justice for victims"".

"Apple has responded to critics of its new anti-child abuse measures Apple has defended its new system that scans users' phones for child sexual abuse material (CSAM), after a backlash from customers and privacy advocates. The technology searches for matches of known abuse material before the image is uploaded to its iCloud storage. Critics warnedit could be a ""backdoor"" to spy on people,and more than 5,000 people and organisations have signed an open letter against the technology. As a result, Apple has pledged not to ""expand"" the system for any reason. Digital privacy campaigners warned last week that authoritarian governments could use the technology to bolster anti-LGBT regimes, or crack down on political dissidents in countries where protests are deemed illegal. But Apple said it would ""will not accede to any government's request to expand"" the system. It published a question-and-answer document,,externalsaying it had numerous safeguards in place to stop its systems from being used for anything other than the detection of child abuse imagery. ""We have faced demands to build and deploy government-mandated changes that degrade the privacy of users before, and have steadfastly refused those demands. We will continue to refuse them in the future,"" it said. However, Apple has made some concessions in the past in order to keep operating in countries around the world. Should encryption be curbed to combat child abuse? Facebook encryption 'must not cause children harm' Last New Year's Eve, the tech giant removed 39,000 apps from its Chinese App Store amid a crackdown on unlicensed games by authorities in the country. Apple also said its anti-CSAM tool will not allow the company to see or scan a user's photo album. It will only scan photos that are shared on iCloud. The system will look for matches, securely on the device, based on a database of hashes of known CSAM images provided by child safety organisations. Apple also claims it is nearly impossible to falsely flag innocent people to police. ""The likelihood that the system would incorrectly flag any given account is less than one in one trillion per year,"" it said. There is also a human review of positive matches. Privacy advocates, however, have argued that the only thing preventing that technology being turned to other uses is Apple's promise that it will not be. Digital rights group the Electronic Frontier Foundation,,externalfor example, said that ""all it would take... is an expansion of the machine learning parameters to look for additional types of content"". ""That's not a slippery slope; that's a fully-built system just waiting for external pressure to make the slightest change,"" it warned. Apple also provided reassurances regarding another new feature that will warn children and their parents using linked family accounts, when sexually explicit photos are sent or received. The company says its two new features do not use the same technology, and says it will ""never"" gain access to users' private communications. While there was a backlash regarding Apple's announcement from privacy advocates, some politicians welcomed the new technology. UK Health Secretary Sajid Javid said it was time for others, especially Facebook, to follow suit.

"Vodafone has become the second UK mobile company to reintroduce roaming charges for users travelling in Europe. From January, new and upgrading customers will be charged at least Â£1 a day to use their mobile phone in EU destinations, on several tariffs. It follows similar plans from rival EE, announced in June. Initially, all operators said they would not reintroduce a roaming charge after Brexit, despite having the option to. Vodafone's approach is to limit those that include roaming in Europe to ""selected plans"", including its more expensive options . The rules will change for new and upgrading customers from Wednesday, 11 August, though the charges will not apply until January. ""Existing customers will not be impacted by these changes while they remain on their current price plan, and roaming in the Republic of Ireland will still be included for all customers,"" Vodafone said. After January, affected customers can pay Â£2 a day to use their allowance in Europe - Â£1 if bought in an eight or 15-day bundle. Fair-usage limits also apply at 25GB of roaming data a month. Since 2017, UK consumers have, within reason, been able to use their mobile-phone tariffs - calls, texts and data - as freely in the EU as at home. But when the EU trade deal was signed in December 2020, it opened the door to users being charged when travelling in Europe. While the agreement encouraged operators to have ""transparent and reasonable rates"", it did not ban the charges outright. Mobile roaming: What you need to know EE to reintroduce Europe roaming charges in January EE was the first to break ranks, with its Â£2 daily charge to 47 European destinations, which will also kick in from January. Its customers will also not be charged to use their phones in the Republic of Ireland. Currently, O2 allows a roaming limit of 25GB, with any data used over that charged at Â£3.50 per gigabyte. Three has cut its fair-use data limit from 20GB a month to 12GB when in Europe. It charges Â£3 per gigabyte above that. Uswitch mobile analyst Ernest Doku, said: ""In the aftermath of Brexit, the UK's biggest mobile providers all said that they had no immediate plans to change their charging models for consumers roaming within the EU. ""It's disappointing for consumers to see that the situation looks to be shifting, with a risk that roaming at no additional cost could soon be a distant memory for UK residents."" Travellers should check the small print if they were due an upgrade in coming months, Mr Doku said. ""Always use hotel and cafe wi-fi when on holiday, where possible,"" he added. But Paolo Pescatore, an analyst at PP Foresight, said the price changes were a ""harsh reality"" of Brexit. ""Wholesale roaming rates will change given UK's exit, and this in turn will inevitably drive higher prices without EU protection. It's a pretty easy decision for UK telcos,"" he said. All the operators ""are struggling with margins being squeezed, and are seeking ways of increasing revenue while investing billions in costly next generation fixed and mobile networks"", he added.

"The Ratcliffe-on-Soar power station in Nottinghamshire is one of Britain's two remaining coal-fired power stations Coal needs to be consigned to history to limit global warming, says PM Boris Johnson, describing a UN report on climate change as ""sobering"". He said the world must shift to clean energy and provide finance to help countries at risk from changing climates. Thelandmark studyfound it was ""unequivocal"" that human activity was responsible for global warming. Green campaigners said the UK must halt planned new fossil fuel projects. Despite the call to end the use of coal, the UK is considering plans for a new coking coal mine in Cumbria, as well as proposals to tap a new oil field near Shetland. The report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) - the UN group on the science of climate change - said climate change was already here and causing chaos in some places. Its authors said some of the changes, including rising sea levels, would not be reversed for hundreds or maybe thousands of years. The publication comes less than three months before the UK hosts a key climate summit, known as COP26, in Glasgow. Climate report is 'code red for humanity' Follow live reaction to climate report A really simple guide to climate change Five things we have learned from IPCC report Mr Johnson said: ""Today's report makes for sobering reading, and it is clear that the next decade is going to be pivotal to securing the future of our planet. ""We know what must be done to limit global warming - consign coal to history and shift to clean energy sources, protect nature and provide climate finance for countries on the frontline."" The UK government, whichhas adopted a 2035 deadline for a 78% emissions cut,is due to publish its strategy on cutting UK emissions to zero overall by 2050 this autumn. Net zero means cutting carbon emissions as far as possible then balancing out any remaining releases, for example by tree planting. ""The UK is leading the way, decarbonising our economy faster than any country in the G20 over the last two decades,"" the prime minister said. ""I hope today's IPCC report will be a wake-up call for the world to take action now, before we meet in Glasgow in November for the critical COP26 summit."" The UK has already drastically reduced the use of coal, with consumption falling from 61 million tonnes in 2013 to eight million tonnes last year. But the country remains dependent on other fossil fuels such as natural gas, which provides most home heating and about 40% of electricity. The Climate Change Committee, the UK's independent adviser on tackling global warming, saysthe UK has adequate policies for only two of 21 key areas,externalin eliminating carbon emissions. The government faces challenges both on the international stage and closer to home. The biggest will be to persuade the international community to sign up to meaningful measures in Glasgow at COP26. Some 70% of the world's economy has signed up to a net zero target - ministers want that to be higher. They are looking at the G20 in particular to drive change. At home, an increasing number of Tory MPs are worried about the cost of the UK's own targets. Will the infrastructure be in place to support the mass use of electric cars? Who will pay for more expensive boilers in homes? Answering some of those concerns won't be easy. The Treasury is said to be aware of the need to avoid ""extortionate costs"" for low-income families. Ministers want to bring costs down through investment, incentives and mass production. But the specifics will matter to our pockets and our politics. The report said the world would reach or exceed temperature rises of 1.5C - seen as a threshold beyond which the worst impacts of global warming will be felt - over the next two decades. Almost every nation on Earth signed up to the goals of the Paris climate agreement in 2015, which aims to keep the rise in global temperatures well below 2C this century and to pursue efforts to keep it under 1.5C. Alok Sharma, COP26 president, said one of the key messages of the report was that ""the future is not yet written"" and 1.5C was still an achievable goal, although retreating fast. This video can not be played Alok Sharma says ""we need far more in terms of action"" He said based on the conversations he had had, there was ""a clear desire"" among governments to ""keep the 1.5C within reach"". But he said far more was needed in terms of action, adding ""the cost of inaction on climate change is far greater than the cost of action"". Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the report confirmed that the extreme weather events in recent months were ""only going to become more frequent"" and urgent action was needed. ""The biggest threat we now face is not climate denial but climate delay,"" he said. ""Those who, like our prime minister, acknowledge there is a problem, but simply don't have the scale of ambition required to match the moment. ""Our communities and planet can no longer afford the inaction of this government, who are failing to treat the crisis with the seriousness it deserves."" This video can not be played Sir Keir Starmer calls for a ""coalition of countries"" ahead of COP26 to tackle climate change. Labour wants to seea Â£30bn investment in low-carbon industryto support 400,000 jobs. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon told ITV's Good Morning Britain she would be writing to the prime minister to encourage more co-operation between the devolved UK governments in light of the IPCC publication, which she described as ""a grim wake-up call"". But climate campaigners, Scottish Greens and Scottish Labour have called on her to oppose plans to extract more fossil fuels from the Cambo oil field near Shetland, which they said would result in the release of an estimated 135 million extra tonnes of carbon in its lifetime. Minister urges Tory MPs to back PM's climate plan Second-to-last coal-fired power station to close How serious is the government about COP26? The SNP has maintained that the issue is solely a matter for the UK government. The UK government also faced criticism after initially opting not to intervene in a company's plans for a new coking coal mine in Cumbria. It later reversed the decision and a minister will have the final say on the project, after a public inquiry is held next month. This video can not be played BBC Reality Check explains how to cut your carbon footprint Friends of the Earth climate campaigner Tony Bosworth said the prime minister's pledge to consign coal to history ""should mean all coal"" and the prime minister must make clear the mine will not be allowed. Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey said that as hosts of COP26, the UK needs to lead the world in tackling the climate crisis but ""Boris Johnson's dither and delay is costing us time we cannot afford, with drastic consequences"". Green Party Deputy Leader Amelia Womack said ""this must be the moment the government finally realises we are in an emergency"", urging the introduction of a global carbon tax as ""the most powerful way of rapidly eliminating fossil fuels"". Coal mine plan to be re-examined Climate change, a coalmine and a town that needs jobs Climate scientist Dr Michael Byrne, a contributing author to the report, said the study was ""particularly significant"" as it was the first to link extreme weather events to human activities. ""That evidence was inconclusive back in 2013, at the time of the previous IPCC report; now it's irrefutable."" He said to slow and stop global warming, emissions of greenhouse gases needed to be ""rapidly reduced"" to net zero, but he added: ""The UK and Scottish targets of net zero by 2050 and 2045 are not fast enough, we have to be more ambitious. ""Let's hope our political leaders, as they gear up to COP26 in Glasgow this November, take heed.""

"Offices like this might become a thing of the past after Covid-19 Despite most Covid rules ending in Wales, many staff will not be back in the office on Monday - and will never return full-time in some companies. Principality and Admiral - who between them employ about 8,000 people - are developing ""hybrid"" working models, with many workers to stay at home permanently until 2022. Wales enteredalert level zero on Saturdayand social distancing ended. It means staff can return to the office after a risk assessment is carried out. However, Wales TUC general secretary Shavanah Taj said she was ""alarmed"" to find in a poll of workers that 25% of bosses were not complying with rules in place before the changes, and called for strong enforcement action of the new regulations. Most of Wales' coronavirus rules to end What rules will stay in Wales? While First Minister Mark Drakeford said the countrywas entering the ""final lap""of the pandemic, he warned the relaxation of rules should not be seen as a ""free-for-all"". The advice to businesses remains to let staff work from home wherever possible - and it is where most of the Principality Building Society's 800 employees will stay for at least five more months, with risk assessments being carried out at its sites. ""We are currently upgrading our head office to develop and deliver a hybrid approach to home and office working and the majority of our colleagues will remain working from home until next year,"" said chief executive Julie-Ann Haines. ""There has been a fundamental shift in expectations and colleagues have told us they have seen the benefits of being able to work from home, including trading their daily commute time for increased time at home, for exercise or for personal development."" Will more people be working from home rather than in city centres such as Cardiff? The company had surveyed its staff, Ms Haines said. ""The majority of colleagues answered that they would prefer a hybrid approach, where they can choose how many and what days of the week they work from home or the office. ""Colleagues want to be able to have the benefits that home working brings, as well as the social, training and collaboration benefits of working in the office."" Insurance group Admiral - which employs 7,000 people in Cardiff, Swansea and Newport - is also being ""cautious"" and is only bringing a ""proportion"" of staff back into the office on Monday. The company is another looking to embrace a hybrid model in the future, with a spokesman adding: ""We have a unique culture at Admiral and will ensure that continues to thrive, encouraging our people to spend time with their teams to work collaboratively, communicate openly and have fun."" Admiral has offices in Newport, Cardiff and Swansea Despite the end of most Covid rules, a ""small but significant"" number of legal requirements remain - with obligations on businesses, including carrying out risk assessments before staff return. Anyone who has tested positive must self-isolate for 10 days, as well as close contacts who have not been fully vaccinated. Therules also include,externalensuring good hygiene practices, that premises are well ventilated, using barriers and screens, limiting the numbers on site and controlling the use of stairs and lifts. ""When we last polled workers, we were alarmed that only around a quarter of bosses were fully complying with the coronavirus risk assessment law by consulting staff,"" said Ms Taj. ""Refreshed guidance for employers is welcome, but enforcement is key."" Ben Francis, policy chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses Wales, said it was ""incredibly important"" the Welsh government ran ""a strong communication campaign"" so businesses were able to ""adapt to an evolving environment"". He said the return to the office was ""the very beginning of Wales' economic recovery"", adding: ""There will still be much work to do in order to shore up businesses and help them get back on track so that they can both regain ground that was lost but also continue to push forwards, pursue growth and meet their ambitions."" The country is entering a new phase of ""living with virus"", according to Ian Price, director of employers' organisation CBI Wales. It represents thousands of businesses in Wales and Mr Price believes instilling a sense of confidence in the reopening process is crucial. ""Whether through the use of measures like face masks and risk assessments or the many processes businesses have implemented themselves to become more Covid-secure, ensuring staff and customers feel comfortable entering businesses premises is crucial to getting the Welsh economy firing again,"" he said. Some businesses have already changed working patterns for good - Cardiff-based IT company Zipporahmoved from its large officeearlier in the pandemic. Its new base in St Mellons can host about 15 of its 20 staff, but typically sees about five people working there each day.

"Fewer people have been working and spending money in Cardiff during the pandemic, research suggests The number of people working in Cardiff city centre is 50% lower than before the pandemic, according to research. A study by the The Centre for Economics and Business Research (CEBR),externalfound the city had a lower share of workers back in the office than four other major UK cities. It found some Â£400m less had been spent in the city centre since March 2020. The Welsh government said it recognised the ""big impact"" of Covid and was working closely with sectors affected. A review conducted for Cardiff council found the shift to home-working has had ""a radical impact"" for cities, but added many suggestions about the longer-term had been ""premature and shallow"". 'My billion-pound company has no office' Millions become millionaires during Covid pandemic Employers 'looking at flexi-working permanently' The CEBR research concluded spending in shops and food and drink establishments would be about Â£6.3m less per month than at the start of the pandemic, if workers in Cardiff worked from offices for an average of two days per week. However, the financial impact on Cardiff was found to be lower than London, Manchester, Glasgow and Newcastle, the other cities featured in the study. Zipporah, a Cardiff-based IT company which provides resource management software, decided to move from a large site on an industrial unit to a smaller office space last year after finding home working was more useful to its employees. Some businesses, such as Zipporah, are deciding against moving to the city centre Scott Burton, Zipporah's technical director, said: ""We found it was improving things to make a better environment for the team. ""In about August we started looking for new premises. We wanted to get a smaller space."" Mr Burton said the company initially looked to the city centre, so the employees could be closer to shops and hospitality, but this ""wasn't going to stack up financially"". Instead, the company moved to a small office in St Mellons, a suburb of Cardiff, and now has an office which can host about 15 of its 20 staff, but typically sees about five people working there each day. Ziporrah technical director Scott Burton says moving to a suburb of Cardiff had worked well for the company and its staff Although the staff are still a reasonable distance from the city centre, he said the number of shops and food options close to the new work site has improved things for the workers and the local economy. Mr Burton said: ""There's literally nothing around [the previous office] whereas now there's a coffee van, there's a lot not far away. ""At lunchtime you would spend 20 minutes trying to get to the nearest Tesco so there was never any time to actually do anything. ""We wanted to move to the city centre to get more amenities around us but it wasn't going to stack up financially, but you come to somewhere like [St Mellons] and it's got all sorts around it. Now we're a solid line of business to the coffee van."" Rory Fleming manages two of Cardiff's historic shopping arcades Rory Fleming, manager of the Morgan Quarter arcades in the city centre, says the environment in Cardiff has ""completely changed"" since 2019, making it hard to compare to the present day. ""In 2019, offices were fully staffed, people had a lot of confidence using public transport to come in. Whereas in 2021, up until last month, hospitality wasn't allowed to open indoors,"" he said. Mr Fleming said that while trading figures were down from 2019, since 12 April to last week, there was a ""steady growth"" in figures. ""It's down on 2019, but if we can maintain that upward trend from now to the end of the year, that will be a success for us,"" he said. ""People will no doubt be anxious about coming back to the city centre and all we can do is to create an environment to make people feel safe."" He also said their creative quarter, made up of 35 office spaces above St Mary Street, had increased to 80% occupancy ""in some shape or form,"" with more people coming in to work for part of the week. Mr Fleming added there is growing confidence of office workers returning because ""people need some human interaction"". Cardiff council pointed to the issues and steps identified in itsreview of how to take the city forward,externalafter the pandemic. Its report said it was not clear how radical the impact of the shift to home-working would be, nor whether widespread vaccination would restore office occupancy in city centres. It said the shift to home working had been ""substantive"" and predicted much of it would ""stick"", but this would create opportunities, such as attracting companies and workers who might previously have worked all week in larger cities, including London. A Welsh government spokesperson said: ""We fully recognise the Covid pandemic has had a big impact on high streets across Wales, which is why we are working closely with the retail and hospitality sectors to respond to the challenges they face in the short, medium and long term. ""Since the beginning of the pandemic, we've committed more than Â£2.5bn to businesses across Wales in addition to our business as usual support through Business Wales. ""In addition, our Transforming Towns programme is providing nearly Â£110m to help support the economic and social recovery of our town and city centres. ""We also have ambitious plans to help people work smart and remotely in Wales. We are trialling a series of community-based remote working hubs, encouraging people to work closer to home and driving footfall back into town centres."" Is this the end of office working?

"Former Business Secretary Alok Sharma is now leading COP26, the climate summit in Glasgow in November The world is ""dangerously close"" to running out of time to stop a climate change catastrophe, the UK government's climate chief Alok Sharma has said. Mr Sharma - who is leading COP26, the climate summit hosted by the UK this year - said the effects were already clear with floods, fires and heatwaves. ""We can't afford to wait two years, five years, 10 years - this is the moment,""he told the Observer.,external But he did not condemn the government for allowing more fossil fuel projects. And he defended his decision to travel tomore than 30 countries in seven months. Mr Sharma's interview with the Observer comes ahead ofa major report being released on Mondayfrom the United Nations' climate change researchers. The report is set to be the strongest statement yet from the UN group on the science of climate change - and will likely give details about how the world's oceans, ice caps and land will change in the next decades. The summary has been approved in a process involving scientists and representatives of 195 governments, which - having signed off on the findings - will be under pressure to take more action at COP26 in November. Doug Parr, chief scientist with Greenpeace UK, said ""world leaders have done a terrible job of listening"" to warnings about climate change. ""This year, this has to change. We don't need more pledges, commitments and targets - we need real action right here right now."" Wildfires are currently raging in Greece, forcing thousands to evacuate their homes - and fireshave also been burning in Turkeyand California in the US. This summer,western Europe also sawits worst flooding in decades, which killed dozens of people. What is COP26 and what needs to be agreed? A really simple guide to climate change Mr Sharma said if urgent action was not taken, the consequences would be ""catastrophic"". ""I don't think there's any other word for it,"" he said. ""You're seeing on a daily basis what is happening across the world. Last year was the hottest on record, the last decade the hottest decade on record."" This video can not be played What is climate change? He added: ""We're seeing the impacts across the world - in the UK or the terrible flooding we've seen across Europe and China, or forest fires, the record temperatures that we've seen in North America. Every day you will see a new high being recorded in one way or another across the world."" Mr Sharma said the report released on Monday is ""going to be the starkest warning yet that human behaviour is alarmingly accelerating global warming"". ""I don't think we're out of time but I think we're getting dangerously close to when we might be out of time. We will see [from the IPCC] a very, very clear warning that unless we act now, we will unfortunately be out of time."" ""Africa has been waiting for the rest of the world to catch up and act on climate change for years,"" Fredrick Njehu, Christian Aid's senior climate change and energy adviser for Africa, highlighting the ""changing rainfall patterns or overbearing heat"" endured by the continent in recent years. He added: ""The important thing now is that rich world governments make up for lost time and act quickly to reduce emissions and deliver promised financial support for the vulnerable."" Glasgow is set to host the COP26 summit in November - which is the UN climate change conference. The summit is seen as vital if climate change is to be brought under control, and leaders from 196 countries will meet to try and agree action. But campaigners have accused the UK of hypocrisy, as there are plans to tap a new oil field off Shetland. The government has also said more oil and gas wells can be drilled in the North Sea, and there are plans for a new coal mine in Cumbria. Earlier this year, the global energy watchdog the International Energy Agency said there cannot be any new investment in oil, gas or coal projects if we want to limit global warming to 1.5C. Experts say the impacts of climate change are far more severe when the increase is greater than 1.5C. Mr Sharma refused to criticise the government's plan for the projects, saying: ""Future [fossil fuel] licences are going to have to adhere to the fact we have committed to go to net zero by 2050 in legislation. ""There will be a climate check on any licences."" This video can not be played Climate change: How 1.5C could change the world Mr Sharma's interview comes after he was criticised for flying abroad for meetings - and visiting more than 30 countries in seven months. However, since then some environmental campaigners including Greenpeace have defended him, saying face-to-face meetings are important to persuade other nations to tackle climate change. Mr Sharma told the Observer that in-person meetings were ""incredibly vital and actually impactful"". ""It makes a vital difference, to build those personal relationships which are going to be incredibly important as we look to build consensus,"" he said. It also emerged in the Sunday Mirror that,externalForeign Secretary Dominic Raab did not self-isolate after returning from France, which was on the amber plus list meaning all arrivals must quarantine. A government spokesman said it was Mr Raab's job to represent the UK abroad and he followed Covid guidelines on return.

"David Cameron made about $10m (Â£7m) from Greensill Capital before the finance company collapsed, documents obtained by BBC Panorama suggest. The documents indicate the former prime minister received $4.5m after cashing in Greensill shares in 2019. Greensill, which made its money by lending to businesses, went into administration in March, leaving investors facing billions in losses. Mr Cameron's spokesman said his remuneration was a private matter. Greensill collapsed after its insurer refused to renew cover for the loans it was making. Before its collapse, Mr Cameron unsuccessfully tried to persuade ministers to invest taxpayers' money in Greensill loans. He has since been cleared of breaking any lobbying rules, but MPs said the former prime minister showed a ""significant lack of judgement"". The details about Mr Cameron's shares were revealed in a letter from Greensill Capital to the former prime minister. According to the letter, Mr Cameron was going to be paid $4,569,851.60 (about Â£3.3m) after tax for a tranche of his Greensill shares. What did David Cameron do for Greensill? Cameron lacked judgement over Greensill, MPs say Ex-PM Cameron cleared by lobbying watchdog Panorama has not seen Mr Cameron's signed acceptance of the offer, but the letter records that he had already agreed to the deal. As well as the shares, Mr Cameron received a salary of $1m (Â£720,000) a year as a part-time adviser. The programme also understands that the former prime minister was paid a bonus of $700,000 (Â£504,000) in 2019 on top of his salary. In total, it looks like he made around $10m before tax for two-and-a-half years' part-time work. Mr Cameron's spokesman said: ""He acted in good faith at all times and there was no wrongdoing in any of the actions he took."" Panorama: David Cameron and the Missing Billions is on BBC One at 19:35 BST on Monday or lateron iPlayer Panorama has discovered how the company Mr Cameron promoted has left investors and UK taxpayers facing huge losses. Greensill Capital lent around $5bn (Â£3.6bn) to GFG Alliance - a group of companies controlled by the steel magnate Sanjeev Gupta. GFG employs 35,000 people around the world, including more than 4,000 at steel mills in the UK. Internal documents reveal that Greensill Capital knew GFG was in financial trouble by the start of 2020 because it was unable to make payments on Greensill loans. But Greensill used its own cash to cover repayments GFG could not afford - leaving investors unaware of the problems. What is the GFG Alliance and what does it own? An email sent by a Greensill finance officer to a senior manager in April 2020 said that the unusual payments had been going on for four months. It said: ""We are constantly plugging holes that GFG cannot afford to repay... It is not even robbing Peter to pay Paul, it is just recirculation of Greensill funds."" A second email sent at the start of May suggests an insolvency practitioner should be sent in to review Mr Gupta's businesses. It said: ""It may well be that administration is required."" Sanjeev Gupta is executive chairman of GFG Alliance Instead of raising the alarm about GFG's inability to make loan payments, Greensill Capital looked for a new investor. It turned to the UK government - and David Cameron was sent in to try to make it happen. Mr Cameron sent 56 messages lobbying ministers and senior civil servants. He wanted the Bank of England to invest more than Â£10bn of taxpayers' money in Greensill's loans. The Bank of England turned Greensill down, but in June 2020 Greensill was approved as a lender under a government scheme designed to get emergency cash to companies affected by the coronavirus pandemic. The Coronavirus Large Business Interruption Loan (CLBIL) scheme run by the government-owned British Business Bank allowed Greensill to make loans backed by an 80% taxpayer guarantee. Greensill was only supposed to lend a maximum of Â£50m to a single borrower or group of companies under the CLBIL scheme. But Greensill Capital lent Mr Gupta's GFG Alliance Â£350m by making seven taxpayer-backed loans of Â£50m to seven of his companies. Greensill also made an eighth loan of Â£50m to another company closely associated with Mr Gupta. The companies have all failed to make repayments on the taxpayer-backed loans. Greensill auditor under investigation by watchdog How metal tycoon Sanjeev Gupta built his empire The government guarantee has been suspended while the loans are investigated - but that is being challenged and the taxpayer could still lose Â£320m. Mr Gupta's company, GFG Alliance, and its financing arrangements with Greensill Capital, are now being investigated by the Serious Fraud Office. GFG Alliance said it takes the investigation seriously and that all allegations of improper conduct are denied in the strongest terms. The company said it has been working tirelessly to stabilise the businesses affected by the collapse of Greensill and deliver refinancing. GFG said: ""We remain fully committed to UK industry and to a solution that will enable GFG to repay creditors and create a sustainable future for its UK businesses."" Lex Greensill, the founder of Greensill Capital, said the government guarantee on the loans should not be withdrawn. ""Our access to any government-backed schemes with respect to funding our clients has always drawn upon robust advice from leading law firms to ensure Greensill complied with relevant rules,"" he said. Lex Greensill worked with Mr Cameron in Downing Street He also said he was not aware his staff had recommended sending in an insolvency practitioner to GFG. Mr Cameron's spokesman said he was not involved in lending decisions and had no knowledge of GFG's financial situation. ""He was a part-time adviser to the company - one of several - and had no Executive or Board responsibilities whatsoever,"" he said. ""He made the representations he did to the UK government not just because he thought it would benefit the company, but because he sincerely believed there would be a material benefit for UK businesses at a challenging time."" Panorama has also discovered how investors were misled about Greensill Capital's investments. Greensill made money through supply chain finance - which involves making loans to companies that are waiting for invoices to be paid by their customers. When the invoices were paid, the cash would be there to pay investors back, with interest. To fund the loans, it teamed up with Swiss bank Credit Suisse, which raised $10bn from investors. It was the Swiss bank's job to market and sell the Greensill investments, and to inform investors about potential risks. Investors thought their cash was safe, because it was supposed to be secured against the unpaid invoices. But this year it was revealed that some of the invoices simply did not exist. US court papers show how between 2018 and 2021, Greensill lent $850m of investors' cash to a US coal company called Bluestone Resources. Only $70m of that money was secured against real invoices for coal that Bluestone had actually sold. Investors did not know it, but the remaining $780m was only backed by predicted coal sales that may or may not happen in the future. Lex Greensill told Panorama that this type of financing was commonplace in the financial services industry. He said the predicted Bluestone business was all ""based upon future trade that is likely to occur with current customers"". Panorama discovered that was not true. The programme obtained the names of the companies that Lex Greensill said were current customers of Bluestone. Six of the companies said they were not Bluestone customers and they weren't planning to buy its coal in the future. Lex Greensill later told Panorama the coal buyers did not have to be current customers. Bluestone only had to state it expected to make the sales at some future point and Greensill was not obliged to make checks, he said. Mr Greensill denied misleading investors. He said his company made all the appropriate disclosures to Credit Suisse and the Swiss Bank was ""solely responsible for making any disclosures to their investors"". He said the loans were always secured against assets and personal guarantees, and were backed up by insurance that would pay 100% of any shortfall. Credit Suisse says its focus is on returning cash to investors and that 59% has been returned so far.

"This video can not be played Lukashenko: ""You can choke on your sanctions... you are American lapdogs"" Belarus's president has denied claims that his security services were involved in the death of dissident Vitaly Shishov, who was found hanged in neighbouring Ukraine last week. ""Who was he for me and for Belarus? For us he was simply a nobody,"" President Alexander Lukashenko told reporters. Vitaly Shishov was organising help for Belarusians who fled to Ukraine from Mr Lukashenko's post-election crackdown. The UK and US are tightening sanctions on Belarus, hitting economic sectors. They include potash and petroleum products - key sources of income for Mr Lukashenko's regime - as well as financial services and transport. He and his top aides are already under Western sanctions. When asked by the BBC about the latest British measures he said: ""You can go choke on your sanctions... You are American lapdogs!"" There were anti-Lukashenko rallies after the disputed vote a year ago. The weeks of mass protests were the biggest challenge yet to Mr Lukashenko's 27-year rule as president. Last year police detained thousands of anti-Lukashenko protesters as they broke up the demonstrations, using batons and tear gas. The opposition says more than 600 political prisoners are still in jail. Monday's news conference, televised live, was his first such appearance during the political crisis - an event officially named ""the big conversation"". Belarus opposition activists demonstrated in London and other cities on Sunday Support from Russian President Vladimir Putin has proven a lifeline for the embattled president. But Western governments, like the Belarusian opposition, denounced the vote as fraudulent and tightened sanctions. Belarus crackdown fails to crush opposition spirit Europe's longest-serving ruler under fire Belarusian opposition leaders are either in jail or were forced into exile. Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, who claimed victory in the election, is based in Lithuania. Ukrainian police probing Shishov's death are investigating whether it was suicide or a murder made to look like suicide. He was found hanged in a park near his home in the capital Kyiv. Colleagues in his organisation, Belarusian Home in Ukraine, suspect that Lukashenko agents were involved, and say Shishov had been under surveillance. His partner Bazhena Zholudzh told the BBC: ""Lukashenko won't be here forever, and this will all be over and they will have to answer for what they have done."" Belarus dissidents who disappeared and died The case of Belarusian Olympic sprinter Krystina Timanovskaya also grabbed world attention last week. She flew to Poland - not home to Belarus - after a row with Belarusian team coaches. Mr Lukashenko mocked her, saying ""she took 36th place in her discipline - say no more!"" ""Why did we include her? The IOC [International Olympic Committee] recommended her!"" In Tokyo she said there was an attempt to force her onto a flight back to Belarus - a claim denied by Mr Lukashenko, who said there was ""not a single"" KGB agent at the Olympics. Olympics expels Belarus coaches for athlete removal Looking back to the election, Mr Lukashenko said: ""This was not an easy year for us"", adding that Belarus had ""passed a serious test of national unity"". He said that last year ""some were preparing for fair and honest elections, while others were calling for a coup"". Before the latest Western sanctions were announced he warned that he could withdraw co-operation on preventing the smuggling of radioactive materials. ""This is the issue of issues for the Americans... but I have warned them - if you cross the red line too far, we'll stop talking to them on this subject.""

"Former Prime Minister David Cameron made about Â£3.3m from shares in the collapsed finance company Greensill Capital, documents obtained by BBC Panorama suggest. Last month an MPs' report accused Mr Cameron of ""a significant lack of judgement"" in lobbying the government on behalf of the company, although it said he did not break any rules. In 2020, Mr Cameron tried to persuade ministers to allow Greensill - who employed him as an adviser - to join a scheme called the Corporate Covid Financing Facility (CCFF). This would have allowed the company to issue loans, insured by the government, to help firms through the pandemic. However, Mr Cameron - and the company's founder, Lex Greensill - were unsuccessful in their attempts. Greensill Capital collapsed this year, with the loss of 440 jobs, and possible billion-pound losses for investors. Mr Cameron has consistently declined to say how much he was being paid by Greensill, except that it was ""far more"" than his salary as PM. However, BBC's Panorama has obtained a letter from Greensill Capital to the former PM which suggests that he made Â£3.29m after selling a tranche of Greensill shares in 2019. David Cameron 'made $10m' before company's collapse As well as the shares, Mr Cameron is reported to have received a salary of $1m (Â£720,000) a year as a part-time adviser. The programme also understands that the former prime minister was paid a bonus of $700,000 (Â£504,000) in 2019 on top of his salary. In total, it looks like he made around $10m before tax for two-and-a-half years' part-time work. Mr Cameron's spokesman said his remuneration was a private matter. Australian banker Lex Greensill originally worked for David Cameron at No 10 in the early 2010s Mr Cameron has been accused of trying to exploit private contacts with former government colleagues, for his own benefit. The former PM used private channels,externalto lobby ministers and former colleagues. He and his staff sent45 emails, texts and WhatsApp messagesconcerning Greensill between 5 March and 26 June 2020. Among these were nine WhatsApp messages to Chancellor Rishi Sunak and 12 text messages to Sir Tom Scholar, the Treasury's top civil servant. The Bank of England haspublished correspondence,externalshowing that Mr Cameron had contacted senior officials several times, in an unsuccessful attempt to win their support. Along with Lex Greensill, Mr Cameron met Health Secretary Matt Hancock for a ""private drink"" in 2019to discuss a new payment scheme for NHS staff. A report last month by the House of Commons Treasury Select Committee said that while no lobbying rules were broken, Mr Cameron's actions showed there was a ""good case for strengthening them"", with the current ones offering ""insufficient strength"". It also said that the Treasury was right to reject the former PM's proposals, but it ""should have encouraged"" him into ""more formal lines of communication as soon as it had identified his personal financial incentives"". ACabinet Office reviewcommissioned by Boris Johnson also criticised Mr Cameron, and said he had understated his relationship with Greensill when lobbying the Treasury. However, it said that ""his actions were not unlawful"". Several other reviews are investigating matters related to lobbying and Greensill. Responding to the Treasury Committee report, Mr Cameron admitted that he should have used more formal channels, but said he had worked for Greensill primarily because he thought the firm could help small businesses during an economic crisis. However, Deputy Labour Leader Angela Rayner said the fact that Mr Cameron had been cleared of breaking rules proved ""that the rules that are supposed to regulate lobbying are completely unfit for purpose"". Current rules,externalstate that ""on leaving office, ministers will be prohibited from lobbying government for two years"". Before accepting new jobs, former ministers are supposed to inform a body called the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments (Acoba). Acoba advises civil servants and politicians on what they can and can't do after leaving public service. However, although former ministers are required to contact Acoba, they are not obliged to act on its advice. Acoba's head, Lord Pickles, has called for ex-ministers who work as lobbyiststo go on a register for up to 10 years to ensure ""transparency"", The company's collapse earlier this year was triggered after its insurer refused to renew cover for the loans Greensill was making. Greensill was theprincipal financial backer of Liberty Steel, which employs 3,000 people in England, Scotland and Wales. Talks are now underwayto try to secure Liberty's future.

"Former Prime Minister David Cameron has been cleared by a watchdog looking at whether he engaged in lobbying for which he should have been registered. The Registrar of Consultant Lobbyists investigated after reports he had contacted officials on behalf of financial firm Greensill Capital. It concluded that Mr Cameron's activities had not fallen within the criteria that required registration. The contact is said to have taken place after Mr Cameron was prime minister. On Wednesday, a source close to him said he was exempt from the register as he had been an in-house employee for Greensill. The company, which collapsed earlier this month, was a key backer of UK giant Liberty Steel.

"Randox has pledged to expand the number of drop boxes and increase the frequency of collections One of the bigger providers of Covid PCR test kits has responded after images of overflowing drop boxes were shared online. The firm, Randox, said it was increasing the number of drop boxes and the frequency of box collections. The move comes after people posted pictures of returned test kits piled high on top of drop boxes in Sutton and Hampstead over the weekend. One MP said the ""pointless"" tests were ""becoming a bad joke"". At least one PCR test is required for all arrivals from international destinations within two days of landing in the UK. Those returning from green listed countries, or who are fully vaccinated and returning from amber list countries, are required to take only one. However, those not fully vaccinated from amber list destinations must take at least two tests, one on day two and one on day eight. One of those affected, Gavin Marshall, said he had to drop off a test kit on behalf of his daughter, who had completed a PCR test two days after returning from a holiday in Portugal. Despite the fact that the box was full, he said: ""I had no choice but to leave the sample at that site, because there wasn't enough time to get to another drop box before collection deadline."" Mr Marshall called it a ""Covid travel rip-off"". Javid urges review of excessive Covid test costs Rory Boland, Which? Travel Editor, said he had seen problems with several testing firms and an increase in every type of complaint. Complaints included tests not arriving on time, people being unable to book tests and misleading prices. ""It's particularly frustrating as Which? raised this with government a few months ago,"" he added. ""The system isn't set up for large numbers of people travelling and now many people are travelling the system is not working properly. The government might now say it is looking into the prices of tests, but it's very late in the day and these problems were foreseeable."" Labour MP Ben Bradshaw tweeted in reaction to the photos: ""These pointless rip-off day two PCR tests for people returning from amber and green list countries, most of which have a fraction of our Covid-19 rates, are becoming a bad joke."" A government spokesperson said health secretary Sajid Javidhad asked the competition watchdog to investigate excessive pricingand said it was working with testing providers to reduce costs. Nancy Diaz was due to fly to Barcelona on 21 July. When her test arrived, she registered it and delivered it to a Randox Health drop box in Edinburgh, two days before her flight. However, Ms Diaz said she only received confirmation that her test had arrived at the company's laboratory the following evening, meaning she knew her results were not going to come through in time for her flight. Due to the delay, Ms Diaz rebooked her flight for 24 hours later, however, when she received her negative test result at 13:26 BST on 21 July, the day she had originally planned to fly on, she was required to do another test at Edinburgh Airport as her original test results were now outside of the 72-hour window. ""I was given no refund, as they (Randox) claim the 24 hours promise is from when the test arrives at their lab, which can be whenever, apparently,"" said Ms Diaz. ""The fact that the test can take more than 24 hours to arrive to their lab was not mentioned."" Lizzy Merrall ordered tests for her parents and for herself on 19 July, ahead of a family holiday to Spain on 27 July. Her parents' tests arrived, but her pre-departure test she needed to take with her on holiday to do before flying back to the UK did not. ""I contacted Randox on the 26 July asking where my tests were,"" she told the BBC. ""I asked them if they could at least offer me a refund for one of the tests but they never replied to me and I had to pay Â£80 for a last minute test."" Ms Merrrall said her test pack only arrived once she was already on holiday in Spain. Randox has not responded to requests for comment in relation to Ms Diaz's and Ms Merrall's experiences. A spokesperson for the Northern Ireland-based company said it was ""constantly expanding and improving its Covid-19 testing capacity and associated logistics network, which is already the largest in the United Kingdom, to meet the rapidly growing demand resulting from the loosening of travel restrictions"". ""Randox continues to increase the number of drop boxes across the United Kingdom, which already totals over 200, and is increasing the frequency of box collections which are already occurring multiple times per day,"" they added. ""Randox is providing premium testing services in dynamic and rapidly changing circumstances and is committed to continuously improving its logistics network, to ensure that international travellers receive their results in time.  All of the sample kits pictured will be processed."" PCR tests are more expensive than lateral flow tests and have been criticised by some in the travel industry for pricing many potential travellers out. The government has previously defended their use, saying they are useful as they can be sequenced to check for variants of concern, unlike lateral flow tests. But some have criticised the government, saying they are not sequencing enough tests. Last week, Conservative MP Huw Merriman, chair of the Transport select committee, said they should be dropped. ""PCR tests can be two to three times the cost of lateral flow testing. It's pricing out holidays for those that don't have the means to pay for those tests,"" he said. ""I wouldn't mind if the tests were going to be used for sequencing, so we can find all variants of concern, but if only 5% of PCR tests are being sequenced, then surely it's a complete waste of money."" The Department for Health and Social Care (DHSC) has highlighted that as the vast majority of travellers into the UK do not test positive, their tests are not sent for sequencing. Of those sent for sequencing, a minority contain insufficient virus, but more than 95% of viable green and amber tests are sequenced, it said. A DHSC spokesperson said: ""All positive tests for arrivals from red list countries are sequenced and there is a legal requirement for private testing providers to sequence positive PCR tests for amber or green country travellers. ""We are already a world leader in genomics, with over 600,000 positive Covid-19 samples having been sequenced during this pandemic.""

"The advert is an example of ""premeditated racist stereotyping"", according to restaurant critic and presenter Jay Rayner A restaurant has apologised for a ""culturally insensitive"" ad campaign. The Ivy Asia in Chelsea, west London, posted a video on social media which featured women dressed as geishas being pulled in a rickshaw to the restaurant. Food writer Jay Rayner was among the advert's many critics, describing it as ""premeditated racist stereotyping"". The video has since been deleted. The Ivy chain, best known for its original restaurant in Soho, said it was conducting an internal review. In the advert, women dressed as geishas struggle to get into a rickshaw being pulled by an elderly Asian man. It tips over and they are saved by a martial arts-type figure labelled ""the hero"", who uses superhuman strength to propel them to the restaurant.

"David Cameron made about $10m (Â£7m) from Greensill Capital before the finance company collapsed, documents obtained by BBC Panorama suggest. The documents indicate the former prime minister received $4.5m after cashing in Greensill shares in 2019. Greensill, which made its money by lending to businesses, went into administration in March, leaving investors facing billions in losses. Mr Cameron's spokesman said his remuneration was a private matter. Greensill collapsed after its insurer refused to renew cover for the loans it was making. Before its collapse, Mr Cameron unsuccessfully tried to persuade ministers to invest taxpayers' money in Greensill loans. He has since been cleared of breaking any lobbying rules, but MPs said the former prime minister showed a ""significant lack of judgement"". The details about Mr Cameron's shares were revealed in a letter from Greensill Capital to the former prime minister. According to the letter, Mr Cameron was going to be paid $4,569,851.60 (about Â£3.3m) after tax for a tranche of his Greensill shares. What did David Cameron do for Greensill? Cameron lacked judgement over Greensill, MPs say Ex-PM Cameron cleared by lobbying watchdog Panorama has not seen Mr Cameron's signed acceptance of the offer, but the letter records that he had already agreed to the deal. As well as the shares, Mr Cameron received a salary of $1m (Â£720,000) a year as a part-time adviser. The programme also understands that the former prime minister was paid a bonus of $700,000 (Â£504,000) in 2019 on top of his salary. In total, it looks like he made around $10m before tax for two-and-a-half years' part-time work. Mr Cameron's spokesman said: ""He acted in good faith at all times and there was no wrongdoing in any of the actions he took."" Panorama: David Cameron and the Missing Billions is on BBC One at 19:35 BST on Monday or lateron iPlayer Panorama has discovered how the company Mr Cameron promoted has left investors and UK taxpayers facing huge losses. Greensill Capital lent around $5bn (Â£3.6bn) to GFG Alliance - a group of companies controlled by the steel magnate Sanjeev Gupta. GFG employs 35,000 people around the world, including more than 4,000 at steel mills in the UK. Internal documents reveal that Greensill Capital knew GFG was in financial trouble by the start of 2020 because it was unable to make payments on Greensill loans. But Greensill used its own cash to cover repayments GFG could not afford - leaving investors unaware of the problems. What is the GFG Alliance and what does it own? An email sent by a Greensill finance officer to a senior manager in April 2020 said that the unusual payments had been going on for four months. It said: ""We are constantly plugging holes that GFG cannot afford to repay... It is not even robbing Peter to pay Paul, it is just recirculation of Greensill funds."" A second email sent at the start of May suggests an insolvency practitioner should be sent in to review Mr Gupta's businesses. It said: ""It may well be that administration is required."" Sanjeev Gupta is executive chairman of GFG Alliance Instead of raising the alarm about GFG's inability to make loan payments, Greensill Capital looked for a new investor. It turned to the UK government - and David Cameron was sent in to try to make it happen. Mr Cameron sent 56 messages lobbying ministers and senior civil servants. He wanted the Bank of England to invest more than Â£10bn of taxpayers' money in Greensill's loans. The Bank of England turned Greensill down, but in June 2020 Greensill was approved as a lender under a government scheme designed to get emergency cash to companies affected by the coronavirus pandemic. The Coronavirus Large Business Interruption Loan (CLBIL) scheme run by the government-owned British Business Bank allowed Greensill to make loans backed by an 80% taxpayer guarantee. Greensill was only supposed to lend a maximum of Â£50m to a single borrower or group of companies under the CLBIL scheme. But Greensill Capital lent Mr Gupta's GFG Alliance Â£350m by making seven taxpayer-backed loans of Â£50m to seven of his companies. Greensill also made an eighth loan of Â£50m to another company closely associated with Mr Gupta. The companies have all failed to make repayments on the taxpayer-backed loans. Greensill auditor under investigation by watchdog How metal tycoon Sanjeev Gupta built his empire The government guarantee has been suspended while the loans are investigated - but that is being challenged and the taxpayer could still lose Â£320m. Mr Gupta's company, GFG Alliance, and its financing arrangements with Greensill Capital, are now being investigated by the Serious Fraud Office. GFG Alliance said it takes the investigation seriously and that all allegations of improper conduct are denied in the strongest terms. The company said it has been working tirelessly to stabilise the businesses affected by the collapse of Greensill and deliver refinancing. GFG said: ""We remain fully committed to UK industry and to a solution that will enable GFG to repay creditors and create a sustainable future for its UK businesses."" Lex Greensill, the founder of Greensill Capital, said the government guarantee on the loans should not be withdrawn. ""Our access to any government-backed schemes with respect to funding our clients has always drawn upon robust advice from leading law firms to ensure Greensill complied with relevant rules,"" he said. Lex Greensill worked with Mr Cameron in Downing Street He also said he was not aware his staff had recommended sending in an insolvency practitioner to GFG. Mr Cameron's spokesman said he was not involved in lending decisions and had no knowledge of GFG's financial situation. ""He was a part-time adviser to the company - one of several - and had no Executive or Board responsibilities whatsoever,"" he said. ""He made the representations he did to the UK government not just because he thought it would benefit the company, but because he sincerely believed there would be a material benefit for UK businesses at a challenging time."" Panorama has also discovered how investors were misled about Greensill Capital's investments. Greensill made money through supply chain finance - which involves making loans to companies that are waiting for invoices to be paid by their customers. When the invoices were paid, the cash would be there to pay investors back, with interest. To fund the loans, it teamed up with Swiss bank Credit Suisse, which raised $10bn from investors. It was the Swiss bank's job to market and sell the Greensill investments, and to inform investors about potential risks. Investors thought their cash was safe, because it was supposed to be secured against the unpaid invoices. But this year it was revealed that some of the invoices simply did not exist. US court papers show how between 2018 and 2021, Greensill lent $850m of investors' cash to a US coal company called Bluestone Resources. Only $70m of that money was secured against real invoices for coal that Bluestone had actually sold. Investors did not know it, but the remaining $780m was only backed by predicted coal sales that may or may not happen in the future. Lex Greensill told Panorama that this type of financing was commonplace in the financial services industry. He said the predicted Bluestone business was all ""based upon future trade that is likely to occur with current customers"". Panorama discovered that was not true. The programme obtained the names of the companies that Lex Greensill said were current customers of Bluestone. Six of the companies said they were not Bluestone customers and they weren't planning to buy its coal in the future. Lex Greensill later told Panorama the coal buyers did not have to be current customers. Bluestone only had to state it expected to make the sales at some future point and Greensill was not obliged to make checks, he said. Mr Greensill denied misleading investors. He said his company made all the appropriate disclosures to Credit Suisse and the Swiss Bank was ""solely responsible for making any disclosures to their investors"". He said the loans were always secured against assets and personal guarantees, and were backed up by insurance that would pay 100% of any shortfall. Credit Suisse says its focus is on returning cash to investors and that 59% has been returned so far.

"Social media is rife with posts disparaging the vaccine hesitant – but these reactions to a complex and nuanced issue are doing more harm than good. As we head towards the end of another extraordinary year, BBC Future is taking a look back at some of our favourite stories for our ""Best of 2021"" collection.Discover more of our picks here. There should be no doubt about it: Covid-19 vaccines are saving lives.  Consider some recent statistics from the UK. In a study tracking more than 200,000 people, nearly every single participant haddeveloped antibodies against the viruswithin two weeks of their second dose. And despite initial worries that the current vaccines may be less effective against the Delta variant, analyses suggest that both theAstraZeneca and the Pfizer-BioNTech jabs reduce hospitalisation rates by 92-96%. As many health practitioners have repeated, the risks of severe side effects from a vaccine aretiny in comparison to the risk of the disease itself.  Yet a sizeable number of people are still reluctant to get the shots. According to a recent report by the International Monetary Fund, thatranges from around 10-20% of people in the UK to around 50% in Japan and 60% in France.  The result is becoming something of a culture war on social media, with many online commentators claiming that the vaccine hesitant are simply ignorant or selfish. But psychologists who specialise in medical decision-making argue these choices are often the result of many complicating factors that need to be addressed sensitively, if we are to have any hope of reaching population-level immunity.  The 5Cs  First, some distinctions. While it is tempting to assume that anyone who refuses a vaccine holds the same beliefs, the fears of most vaccine hesitant people should not be confused with thebizarre theories of staunch anti-vaxxers. ""They're very vocal, and they have a strong presence offline and online,"" says Mohammad Razai at the Population Health Research Institute, St George's, University of London, who has written about thevarious psychological and social factors that can influence people's decision-makingaround vaccines. ""But they’re a very small minority.""  You might also like:  The vast majority of vaccine-hesitant peopledo not have a political agendaand are not committed to ananti-scientific cause: they are simply undecided about their choice to take the injection.  The good news is that many peoplewho were initially hesitant are changing their mind. ""But even a delay is considered a threat to health because viral infections spread very quickly,"" says Razai. This would have been problematic if we were still dealing with the older variants of the virus, but the higher transmissibility of the new Delta variant has increased the urgency of reaching as many people as quickly as possible.  Fortunately, scientists began studying vaccine hesitancy long before Sars-Cov-2 was first identified in Wuhan in December 2019, and they have explored various models which attempt to capture the differences in people's health behaviour. One of the most promising is known as the 5Cs model, which considers the following psychological factors: Confidence:the person's trust in the vaccines efficacy and safety, the health services offering them, and the policy makers deciding on their rollout Complacency:whether or not the person considers the disease itself to be a serious risk to their health Calculation:the individual's engagement in extensive information searching to weigh up the costs and benefits Constraints (or convenience): how easy it is for the person in question to access the vaccine Collective responsibility: the willingness to protect others from infection, through one's own vaccination In 2018, Cornelia Betsch at the University of Erfurt in Germany and colleagues asked participants to ratea series of statements that measured each of the 5Cs, and then compared the results with their actual uptake of relevant procedures, such as the influenza or the HPV vaccine. Sure enough, they found that the 5Cs could explain a large amount of the variation in people's decisions, and consistently outperformed many other potential predictors – such as questionnaires that focused more exclusively on issues of trust without considering the other factors. In currently unpublished research, Betsch recently used the model to predict people's uptake of the Covid-19 vaccines, and her results so far suggest that the 5Cs model can explain the majority of the variation in people's decisions. There will be other contributing factors, of course. A recent study from the University of Oxford suggests thata fear of needles is a major barrier for around 10% of the population. But the 5Cs approach certainly seems to capture the most common reasons for vaccine hesitancy. Confirmation bias When considering these different factors and the ways they may be influencing people's behaviour, it is also useful to examine the various cognitive biases that are known to sway our perceptions. Consider the first two Cs – theconfidencein the vaccine, thecomplacencyabout the dangers of disease itself. Jessica Saleska at the University of California, Los Angeles points out that humans have two seemingly contradictory tendencies – a ""negativity bias"" and an ""optimism bias"" thatcan each skew people’s appraisals of the risks and benefits.  The negativity bias concerns the way you appraise events beyond your control. ""When you're presented with negative information, that tends to stick in your mind,"" says Saleska. The optimism bias, in contrast, concerns your beliefs about yourself – whether you think you are fitter and healthier than the average person. These biases may work independently, meaning that you may focus on the dangerous side effects of the vaccines while simultaneously believing that you are less likely to suffer from the disease, a combination that would reduce confidence and increase complacency. Then there's the famous confirmation bias, which can also twist people's perceptions of the risks of the virus through the ready availability of misinformation from dubious sources that exaggerate the risks of the vaccines. This reliance on misleading resources means that people who score highly on the ""calculation"" measure of the 5Cs scale – the people who actively look for data – are often more vaccine hesitant than people who score lower. ""If you already think the vaccination could be risky, then you type in 'is this vaccination dangerous?', then all you are going find is the information that confirms your prior view,"" says Betsch. Remember that these psychological tendencies are extremely common. Even if you have accepted the vaccine, they have probably influenced your own decision making in many areas of life. To ignore them, and to assume that the vaccine hesitant are somehow wilfully ignorant, is itself a foolish stance. Nor should we forget the many social factors that might influence people's uptake – the ""constraints/convenience"" factor in the 5Cs. Quite simply, the perception that a vaccine is difficult to access will only discourage people who are already sitting on the fence. When we spoke, Betsch suggested that thismight have slowed the uptake in Germany, which has a very complicated system to identify who is eligible to receive the vaccine at any one time. People would respond much more quickly, she says, if they received automatic notifications.  Razai agrees that we need to consider the question of convenience, particularly for those in poorer communities who may struggle with the time and expense of the journey to a vaccination centre. ""Travelling to and from that may be a huge issue for most people who are on minimum wage or unemployment benefits,"" he says. That's why it's often best for the vaccines to be administered in local community centres. ""I think there has been anecdotal evidence of it being more successful in places of worship, mosque, gurdwaras, and churches.""  Finally, we need to be aware of the context of people's decisions, he says – such as the structural racism that might had led certain ethnic groups to have lower overall trust in medical authorities. It is easy to dismiss someone else's decisions if you don't understand the challenges they face in their day-to-day lives. Opening a dialogue So what can be done? There is no easy solution, but health authorities can continue to provide easy-to-digest, accurate information address the major concerns. According toa recent report by Imperial College London's Institute of Global Health Innovation (IGHI), the major barriers continue to be patient's concerns about the side effects and the fears that the vaccines haven’t been adequately tested.  For the former,graphics showing the relative risks of the vaccines, compared to the actual disease, can provide some context. For the latter, Razai suggests that we need more education about the history of the vaccines' development. The use of mRNA in vaccines has been studied for decades, for instance – with long trials testing its safety. This meantthe technique could be quickly adapted for the pandemic. ""None of the technology that has been used would be in any way harmful because we have used these technologies in other areas in healthcare and research,"" Razai says.  Sarah Jones, a doctoral researcher who co-led the IGHI report, suggests a targeted approach will be necessary. ""I would urge governments to stop thinking they can reach the mass of niches out there with one mass-market vaccine message, and work more creatively with many effective communications partners,"" she says. That might involve closer collaborations with the influencer role models within each community, she says, who can provide ""consistent and accurate information"" about the vaccines' risks and benefits. However they choose to deliver the information, health services need to make it clear that they are engaging in an open dialogue, Razai says – rather than simply dismissing them out of hand. ""We have to listen to people's concerns, acknowledge them, and give them information so they can make an informed decision.""  Saleska agrees that it's essential to engage in a two-way conversation – and that's something that we could all learn as we discuss these issues with our friends and family. ""Being respectful and recognising their concerns – I think that could actually be more important than just spitting out the facts or statistics,"" she says. ""A lot of the time, it's more about the personal connection than it is about the actual information that you provide."" *David Robsonis the author of The Intelligence Trap: Why Smart People Do Dumb Things.

Steve HoldenMusic reporter, BBC Newsbeat One of Scotland's most famous music venues is preparing to open its doors for the first time in 18 months now that coronavirus restrictions are lifted. If you've ever been to King Tut's Wah Wah Hut you'll know its famous steps inside which have the names printed of all the massive artists who've played there over the years. Manager Nicola tells me lockdown has had a big impact on staff and customers at the 300-capacity venue. ""It's made a lot of us quite introverted almost, you start doubting yourself I think. Just to get everyone back in the one place we love so much and to just have that energy around us again is going to be so, so good,"" she says. Sound engineer Jordan says it's ""unbelievable to be back"" and John on the bar says ""there's no stone unturned in this venue to make sure it's safe for everyone coming in"". He says they're booked up with acts until 2024. Clubbers queued outside venues in Scotland and celebrated when they reopened at midnight We are going to be winding down our coronavirus updates soon so here's a recap on the day's news: Baroness Dido Harding will step down from her NHS role in October. The Tory peer became chairwoman of NHS Improvement in October 2017. Baroness Harding was also executive chairwoman of the Government's coronavirus Test and Trace programme until April this year. The scheme has come in for criticism over the course of the pandemic, with a report from the Commons Public Accounts Committee in March saying there was""no clear evidence""the Â£22bn venture contributed to a reduction in coronavirus infection levels. News of her departure from NHS Improvement was first reported by theHealth Service Journal.,external Read more:Dido Harding's meteoric rise from telecoms to test and trace, and beyond The UK's much-lauded vaccine programme has been hailed as a success and the way out of the pandemic. But how does it compare with others around the world? As you can see below, the UK remains ahead of other major nations and the EU in terms of vaccination doses delivered per 100 people. Obviously the figures here are above 100 for every hundred people as it adds together first and second doses. And it is based on entire populations, rather than just those aged over 19. But when you compare with other countries around the world the UK now has the 10th highest rate of vaccination doses per 100 people - with the UAE some way out in front. While these are impressive figures on the vaccination front, the Uk has faced another accusation that it is ""hoarding"" Covid vaccines. The Global Justice Now campaign group says the UK's unused doses of vaccine could cover the 10 least-vaccinated countries in the world, which includes Syria, Yemen and South Sudan. The group says low and middle income countries are left ""fighting for scraps"". The UK has ordered more than 500 million doses of seven of the most promising vaccines, including the four so far approved for use. There would be millions of doses to spare even if all over-16s were jabbed and third doses were given to high-risk groups, Global Justice Now says, citing data from life science analytics company Airfinity. Nick Dearden, director of the campaign group, says: ""It's an insult to the thousands dying each day from Covid-19."" China and India have administered the highest number of vaccine doses, with almost 1.8 billion and more than 500 million respectively. The US ranks third, with around 350 million. While countries in Europe and the Americas are progressing well with their vaccination campaigns,many states in Africa have experienced supply issues. Read more:How fast is progress around the world? The UK is now on the brink of having three-quarters of its adult population fully vaccinated against Covid. It looked possible that the landmark could have been reached in today's figures - but bear in mind that Sunday is the slowest day for vaccines - because fewer centres are open and fewer appointments are made. Instead, the total has ticked up to 74.8% - or 39,551,538 people if you are counting them individually. So if you have had the jab in your arm today, then you will probably find out this time tomorrow that you are a little part of history. The UK reached the 50% milestone on3 Juneand 25% of adults had received both jabs by27 April. The government has already announced that by the end of September, people in England will require full vaccination statusto go to nightclubs and some other events with large crowds- so ministers will be watching the second dose figure to see how close it edges to 100% in the weeks ahead. The updated figures also show that 37 people more died in the UK with coronavirus. This brings the total number of people to die within 28 days of a positive Covid-19 test to 130,357. Today's death toll is up on 24 on the same day a week ago and 14 two weeks ago, which is the clearest indication of how the figures are changing. But this was always expected as deaths tend to come about three weeks, on average, after infection and there was a surge in cases during July. There have been a further 25,161 new coronavirus infections recorded in the last 24 hours in the UK,according to government data.,external This is  slightly down from  Sunday but up from 21,952 last Monday. Today's figure includes the 852 new cases in Scotland, in the final  24-hour period before lockdown restrictions were lifted. As we heard earlier, analysis from the Office for National Statistics suggests vaccine hesitancy is falling, but is still high in London. The figures also suggest hesitancy among young people has fallen, but among black people is growing. Dr Nikki Kanani, deputy lead for the NHS vaccination programme, says she wants to thank NHS colleagues and volunteers for their work to increase confidence in the Covid jab among people of all age groups and ethnic minority backgrounds. ""The vaccine remains the single best defence against Covid and whether you have been eligible for some time, or are a newly eligible 16 or 17-year-old, I would urge you to come forward and take up the evergreen offer of a vaccine in order to protect yourself and your loved ones,"" she says. Most of Scotland's legal coronavirus restrictions ended today but some rules are staying for time being - like face coverings and the 1m social distancing rule in secondary schools for at least six weeks. Since May, secondary pupils in England have not needed to wear masks in classrooms or communal areas,although some schools have asked students to In Scotland, people will still have to wear face coverings in all the same indoor settings as in level zero, such as shops, hospitality venues and public transport. The rules say that face coverings can beremoved while dancing, drinking and dining, and drinking at the barwill be allowed in pubs. The 2m distancing rule will remainin healthcare settingssuch as hospitals, GP surgeries and dental surgeries.. The Scottish government is also continuing to advise people to work from home where it is an option for them. Again this is a different stance from England where a graduakl return of these people to the workplace over the summer has been advised.Here's our guide to the rule changes. Pupils across England are preparing to collect their A-level results and some of them may be wondering what awaits them if they choose to go to university. Three siblings from Swindon haveshared their experiencesof university life. For Danielle Herbert, 22, the pandemic meant a cancelled graduation, sitting alone while friends partied on the floor above and ""massive gaps"" in learning. Older sister Jess, 24, says the pandemic ""stripped away"" her independence and she found working online ""lonely and isolating"". But for their brother Ryan, 21, learning online during the pandemic gave him the ""ability to openly ask questions"" and ""learn in my own time"". Restaurateurs in Scotland are welcoming the lifting of limits on the number of diners as coronavirus restrictions are eased. There is now no limit on the number of people per table but masks must be worn when walking around a restaurant and customers are encouraged to continue using the Test and Protect app. Tammy Gilpin assistant manager of the Marlborough in Glasgow says: ""The lack of social distancing now inside is a really big thing in hospitality. ""It means, for us, we have now the capacity for 14 tables instead of eight. ""So obviously that's more people through the doors. It's really great news, it's a big step forwards."" It's a landmark moment in Scotland's coronavirus battle as all legal restrictions are ended. The pandemic is by no means over but what does the data tell us about how it has played out in Scotland? . CASES There have been355, 407confirmed cases of Covid-19 since the start of the pandemic. That incluides the852new cases confirmed on Sunday, HOSPITALISATIONS At the peak of the outbreak in spring 2020 there were more than1,500Covid patients in hospital, including over200in intensive care wards. Numbers reduced over the summer, but started to rise steadily again in September. In January 2021, the number of Covid patients in hospital passed the spring 2020 peak of1,520. There were40people in intensive care and360people in hospital with recently confirmed Covid-19 on Friday,according to the latest data.,external DEATHS The first coronavirus deathwas reported by NHS Lothian on 13 March 2020. Since then,7,992people have died following a positive test according to Scottish government data to 6 August. No further deaths were added to the total for Saturday or Sunday - but it should be noted that most register offices remain closed over the weekend. You can read our full analysis of key coronavirus figures in Scotlandhere. Scotland has recorded 852 new Covid cases and no deaths in the past 24 hours, Scottish government figures show. It is the last 24-hour period before the lifting of most coronavirus restrictions asthe country moved beyond level 0 at midnight. The daily test positivity rate is 6.7%, up from 6.0% the previous day, and 356 people were in hospital on Sunday, down by four on the day before. We'll bring you UK-wide Covid figures in about 80 minutes when they are published by the government. A florist in Glasgow's West End says she's delighted that business is getting back to normal as Scotland's coronavirus restrictions are lifted. Brenda Hodgkins says she's happy that she and her customers will still need to wear a mask inside her shop, Petals Flowers. She says: ""I want to stay open. It's great getting back to the way things were, getting a wee bit back to normality again. ""I don't think the masks are going anywhere soon, I think we are going to be having them on for a long, long time and if that's what we have to do, that's what we have to do."" Randox, one of the largest suppliers of Covid test kits, says it will increase the number of drop boxes and frequency of collections after images of overflowing boxes were shared online. The company provides PCR tests which are required for people returning to the UK from green and amber list countries. Travellers must pay for their own tests and the system has been criticised with some in the travel industry saying it is pricing people out of choosing foreign holidays this summer.

In a statement Randox says: ""Randox is providing premium testing services in dynamic and rapidly changing circumstances and is committed to continuously improving its logistics network, to ensure that international travellers receive their results in time."" As we've been telling you during our coverage today, most legal Covid rules in Scotland have been lifted. But what's the situation in the rest of the UK? InWales, the measures were eased further on Saturday. This means:  But a few restrictions remain, including the call to work from home wherever possible. InEngland, measures were eased on 19 July. The changes include:  InNorthern Ireland, some things have changed including:  For more detail on what the rules are in the UK's different nations,you can read our explainer here. The nurse who vaccinated Scotland's First Minister is urging young people not to have vaccination parties. Elaine Anderson, 51, was thrust into the limelight when she gave Nicola Sturgeon her first Covid-19 jab in April. Anderson, who is from Clydebank in West Dunbartonshire, usually works as a vaccinator in schools. She says: ""Now we are vaccinating the young people, which is fabulous. ""Many just say 'Please get it into me' - they just want go get back to normality."" ""Nothing makes me happier than looking out the window and seeing people in their droves, lining up to get their vaccination. ""There's such excitement - I get a real buzz. ""My parting line to them is 'Please don't have a vaccination party!""' Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon she says her message to people is to ""enjoy the return of many freedoms but be careful"". As most legal coronavirus restrictions were lifted in Scotland, Sturgeon urged people to wear face coverings where appropriate, wash their hands regularly and keep rooms ventilated. She says even though it is no longer a legal requirement not to mix indoors with other households it still makes sense to keep a safe distance. She says: ""If we are careful and cautious as we lift these restrictions hopefully we will continue to keep the virus under control."" She says her most overwhelming and important message is to get vaccinated - particularly those in the younger age groups. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Ocado Group is the firm that provides the online grocer's technology platform Staff at Ocado Group, the tech firm behind the online grocer, can now work abroad remotely for one month a year. The move comes as firms rethink workplace policies after the pandemic. The firm's chief people officer, Claire Ainscough, toldthe Times newspape,externalr that its employees were still being encouraged to return to the office. Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng told the BBC that flexible working was ""here to stay"", but he would be urging his team to come in more. Government employees have been asked to make a ""gradual return"" to Whitehall, but Mr Kwarteng is calling for them to work from the office two to three days a week. Under the Ocado Group scheme, staff who worked from home during the pandemic will be able to do their jobs remotely, subject to certain restrictions, from locations including outside the UK. The scheme does not apply to Ocado Retail, the online supermarket, which is jointly owned by Ocado Group and Marks & Spencer. Ms Ainscough said this answered a ""top question"" from staff, particularly those who had families abroad and did not want to use up their leave by spending time with them. Ocado Group said it wanted to offer ""a balance and choice"" in response to requests from staff. Meanwhile, government departments have seen just a few people go back to the office, despite a recommendation that they should make a ""gradual return"" over the summer. Asked about home working, Mr Kwarteng told the BBC: ""I think flexible working is something that is here to stay, but I've always said that I think it's up to employers and employees to come to their own arrangements, depending on the needs of the company and the needs of the business. ""I don't think it makes sense to have a government diktat telling people exactly how many hours they're going to spend in the office and exactly how many hours they're going to spend at home. I'll be encouraging [civil servants] to come in, but of course again there'll be a degree of flexibility and that's what we're working to achieve."" One unnamed Cabinet minister,externaltold the Daily Mail that civil servants who refused to return to their offices should have their pay cut. ButMr Kwarteng rejected the idea, saying it would set colleagues against each other. Should I be working at home or going to the office? 'Hybrid working will become the norm' A number of other companies have announced policies on what has become known as ""hybrid working"" - allowing staff to work partly from home and partly in the office. Supermarket giant Asdahas said it will allow staff at its head offices to ""select the best location to do their job"", including home, head office or even a store or depot. However, not all companies plan to embrace a hybrid approach.Investment bank Goldman Sachshas said it wants people to come back into the office once restrictions have ended. At the same time, there is evidence that companies are facing challenges in recruiting new staff as pandemic restrictions continue to ease. Stephen Ingham, chief executive of recruitment firm Page Group, told the BBC that in some cases, companies were now outbidding each other for staff. ""Talking to a lot of our clients, right the way through their businesses, from the top to the bottom, they are finding it very difficult to hire people and I think there are a lot of vacancies out there,"" he said. Mr Ingham added that companies were also ""doing their best to keep existing staff"", so that existing salaries were being ""elevated to try to persuade staff to stay where they are"". ""We are now starting to see wage inflation,"" he said. Zoom bets billions on home working continuing What are the new working from home rules?

"The world's largest ever report into climate change is published, setting out the stark reality of the state of the planet The study, by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, says it is ""unequivocal"" that human activity is responsible for global warming Some changes, like sea-level rises, are irreversible, the study finds But there is new hope that deep cuts in emissions of greenhouse gases could stabilise rising temperatures It is the most up-to-date assessment of how global warming will change the world in the coming decades, and looked at more than 14,000 scientific papers Environmental experts have said it is a ""massive wake-up call"" to governments to cut emissions In recent years, the world has seen record-breaking temperatures, raging wildfires and devastating flooding Edited by Hugo Bachega We're ending our live updates following the release of the landmark UN report on climate change. Thank you for joining us. Here are the key points:  You can find out more about the report here. Today's updates were brought to you by Ashitha Nagesh, David Walker and Toby Luckhurst.

He's also had solar panels on his roof for the last eight years, and says his home is now zero-carbon. ""People should make whatever effort they can. We've put in a heat pump, but everything helps and people should hold the government to account and make it fulfil its commitments on climate change."" He adds that while he knows the changes he's made are ""difficult and expensive"" for most people, the government should help with grants. AndDave Stevensthinks politicians are shifting the blame by saying people can tackle climate change by changing their own behaviour. ""They ask us to cycle more as if it's going to have a real impact, but, in the same breath, they're announcing billions of pounds to be spent on new road building schemes,"" he says, adding that there should be more tax incentives to encourage change. ""Of course there should be more bike paths, more low carbon electricity, more Low Traffic Neighbourhoods - and not everyone will like everything, we'll all dislike something, but we've got to move ten times faster than we have been doing."" Extreme heat, rainfall and other severe weather events are already more frequent and intense as a result of climate change, and the IPCC warns that as the planet continues to warm, this will only get worse. Here are pictures of some of the extreme weather we've seen in recent months. Wildfires on Evia island in Greece, August: Firefighters are attempting to put out the flames raging on the Greek island this week The North American heatwave, July: The heatwave left huge areas of California bone-dry and prone to wildfires A cooling centre was set up at the Oregon Convention Center in Portland to help people affected by the heatwave Flooding in western Europe, July: The Rhine river flooded the German city of Cologne The Belgian city of LiÃ¨ge was also hit by heavy flooding Flooding in Henan province in China, July: More than 300 people were killed in the flooding in Henan province The IPCC report might seem overwhelming, but there are still things we can do to tackle climate change. Environment correspondent Matt McGrath and Science correspondent Victoria Gill have been discussing their favourite solutions - from carbon taxes to vintage shopping. You can hear more about tackling climate change with Liz Bonnin, on theWhat Planet Are We On Podcast, available now on BBC Sounds. This video can not be played Matt McGrathEnvironment correspondent A recent study shows thatthe percentage of the global population at risk from flooding has risen by almost a quartersince the year 2000. Satellite images were used to document the rise, which is far greater than had been predicted by computer models.

The analysis shows that migration and a growing number of flood events are behind the rapid increase. By 2030, millions more will experience increased flooding due to climate and demographic change, according to the authors of the study, released before today's IPCC report. Flooding is the environmental disaster that impacts more people than any other, say researchers. That view has echoed around the world in recent weeks, with huge inundations destroying lives and property. In this new study, researchers looked at daily satellite imagery to estimate both the extent of flooding and the number of people exposed to over 900 large flood events between 2000 and 2018. They found that between 255 and 290 million people were directly affected - and between 2000 and 2015, the number of people living in these flooded locations increased by 58-86 million. This represents an increase of 20-24% in the proportion of the world population exposed to floods, some 10 times higher than previous estimates. The report warns that both extreme heat and extreme rainfall will become a lot more frequent and intense as global temperatures continue to rise. Both are already worse than pre-industrial levels, as the graphics below show. Satellite images show wildfires on the Greek island of Evia The IPCC's report was published this morning and is already making a huge impact, with world leaders and climate scientists across the globe calling for urgent action. So what have we learned? BBC environment correspondent Matt McGrath has summed up some of the biggest takeaways from the report - andyou can read them in detail here.

The Swedish activist told Vogue Scandinavia that fashion brands needed to take responsibility for the environmental impact of their products. She highlighted ""fast fashion that many treat as disposables"". In a separate interview, Thunberg said she now plans to attend the UN climate conference due to be held in Glasgow this November.She had previously said she would skip COP26because she was concerned that the pandemic would leave some countries unable to attend. ""I've said before that I wasn't going to go if it wasn't fair,"" she told Reuters. ""But now they say that they will vaccinate all the delegates that are going
there. If that's considered fair and safe, then I will hopefully
attend."" You've been getting in touch with us with your thoughts on the IPCC report, and to tell us how you incorporate green habits into your lives. Keval Shah, London: My wife and I went vegan 11 years ago. The easiest, fastest and most convenient way to mitigate global warming is for the population to do the same. We need to get policymakers to make the connection now, as an urgent matter, and shift subsidies away from animal agriculture and towards a plant-based food system. Nothing else will work in time to save the planet.  Anne-Marie Moore, Scotland: I grow a variety of plants to attract insects and small animal life. Don't use plastic where unnecessary. Don't drive anymore. Recycling all waste where possible. Monitoring energy use at home. Becoming more aware of issues and behaviours that cause issues so I can educate my family on how to be eco friendly.  Lionel Tay, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia: I educate my six-year-old son on climate change, and how to cut down waste and recycle as much as possible. I share with him the recent BBC news on the wildfires in US, Turkey and Greece, as well as floods in China, Germany, Belgium and India. This Covid-19 lockdown was perfect timing for us to show him how we can cut down usage of water, electricity and other resources at home.  Brylie Christopher Oxley, Finland: Living with my son in a 50sqm apartment and without owning a private car. We're also primarily vegetarian, although we eat fish and some dairy (also oat milk substitute). Setting these kinds of constraints encourages more sustainable choices by default.  Esther McVey is one Conservative worried about the costs of changes designed to reduce carbon emissions A small group of Conservative MPs in the UK have saidthey fear the costs of tackling climate change will harm poor families. Former cabinet minister Esther McVey is one of the Tory MPs worried about the cost of changing boilers and insulating homes. ""What I would never want to do is bankrupt the country,"" she said. ""We don't go green and go red as a country at the same time."" But many others in the UK's ruling party have backed the government's net zero carbon target. Sam Hall, director of the Conservative Environment Network, which says it has the support of 105 Tory MPs, said the UK has a ""huge opportunity"" to lead the world. Environment Minister Zac Goldsmith has called the IPCC report ""appalling reading"". David BrownBBC News We've heard stark warnings this morning about the need to limit greenhouse gas emissions - and most of those warnings have been directed at governments. ButChina's carbon emissions are vast and growing, dwarfing those of other countries. Experts agree that without big reductions in China's emissions, the world cannot win the fight against climate change. President Xi Jinping has said his country will aim for its emissions to reach their highest point before 2030 and for carbon neutrality to be achieved by 2060 - but he has not said how China will achieve this extremely ambitious goal. While all countries face problems getting their emissions down, China is facing the biggest challenge. China's per-person emissions are about half those of the US, but its huge 1.4 billion population and explosive economic growth have pushed it way ahead of any other country in its overall emissions. China became the world's largest emitter of carbon dioxide in 2006 and is now responsible for more than a quarter of the world's overall greenhouse gas emissions. The country has some big advantages, particularly its capacity to stick to long-term strategies and mobilise large-scale investments. The Chinese authorities are facing a colossal task. What happens next could hardly be more important. The president of COP26 - the global climate summit in Glasgow this November - says we need ""far more in terms of action"" to control rising global temperatures. Alok Sharma said the G20 group of nations was ""absolutely key"" to meeting targets, as they produced 80% of global emissions. This video can not be played We've heard stark warnings about the rise in global temperature today. But what does that actually look like? Reality Check UK Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng
said this morning that cutting emissions does not necessarily need to mean the
economy shrinking. âIf
you look at the figures since 1990, weâve managed to reduce carbon emissions by
45% while growing the economy by 80% in that time,â he claimed. Total emissions did fall 45%,externalbetween 1990 and 2019 in the UK. Coronavirus restrictions also led to a big reduction in
the amount coming from the transport sector (that contributed to a 49% fall
between 1990 and 2020). Between 1990 and 2019,the economy grew by 78%,external. Again there was a subsequent Covid affect, with some of that
growth lost due to lockdowns (if you factor that in then the economy grew by
60% between 1990 and 2020). So the claim is supported by the
2019 figures, but those are now somewhat out of date. This video can not be played Greece wildfires: 'It's like a horror movie but it's real life' Today's report makes it clear that the effects of climate change caused by human activity can already be seen around the world in extreme heatwaves, heavy rainfall, droughts and tropical cyclones. It comes as Greece experiences its most severe heatwave in 30 years, with devastating wildfires on the island of Evia. If you are just joining us, here is a round-up of today's main events: Jonathan AmosScience correspondent We need to talk about that
scary dotted line in the IPCC's sea-level projections - the one that says a
global ocean rise approaching two metres by the end of the century can't be ruled out. This outcome is considered a low probability but it would have major impact if it happened. The line has been included because there are processes that can affect the melting and break-up of ice sheets which scientists still donât yet fully understand. One of these is something called Marine Ice Cliff Instability, or MICI (pron: Mickey). This is a scenario in which ice sheets could crumble away very quickly if the retreating edges of, say, Antarctica exposed extremely tall cliffs of ice. We know from the physics of ice that such structures cannot support their own weight and will slump. The question is: how likely is MICI to take hold in Antarctica and how fast could it progress? Right now, scientists can't answer this. They see some evidence for the process having occurred in the Earth's history; and think if it did happen, it's a possibility only under the most pessimistic warming futures. Dr Rob Larter, a marine geophysicist with the British Antarctic Survey, commented: ""With the present state of knowledge I agree with the description of runaway MICI as a low probability. However, I think it would be negligent to ignore it."" One final word. Don't lose sight of the sea-level rises that this report considers very likely. Remember, every additional centimetre increase in the height of the oceans puts more people at risk of coastal flooding. Valerie Masson-Delmotte, co-chair of the working group behind the IPCC report: Many of the changes set in motion by human-caused climate change are slow processes. These long lasting changes for the most part affect the planet's frozen regions and the oceans. Changes in ice sheets, deep ocean temperature and acidification will continue for centuries to thousands of years, meaning that they are irreversible in our lifetime and will continue for generations to come. The good news is that these irreversible changes can be slowed down with rapid, strong and sustained reductions in emissions.  Hoesung Lee, chairman of the IPCC: It is indisputable that human activities are causing climate change and making extreme weather events more frequent and severe. [The report] shows that climate change is affecting every region on our planet. It explains that strong, rapid, sustained reduction in carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions will be required to limit global warming.  Petteri Taalas, secretary-general of the World Meteorological Organization: Have we lost hope? No and yes. According to this report we still have a chance to stop the negative climate trend by the middle of this century by especially limiting the use of fossil fuels and by stopping deforestation... The report underlines the urgency to enhance the ambition level of climate mitigation.  Â© 2025 BBC.

"The Ratcliffe-on-Soar power station in Nottinghamshire is one of Britain's two remaining coal-fired power stations Coal needs to be consigned to history to limit global warming, says PM Boris Johnson, describing a UN report on climate change as ""sobering"". He said the world must shift to clean energy and provide finance to help countries at risk from changing climates. Thelandmark studyfound it was ""unequivocal"" that human activity was responsible for global warming. Green campaigners said the UK must halt planned new fossil fuel projects. Despite the call to end the use of coal, the UK is considering plans for a new coking coal mine in Cumbria, as well as proposals to tap a new oil field near Shetland. The report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) - the UN group on the science of climate change - said climate change was already here and causing chaos in some places. Its authors said some of the changes, including rising sea levels, would not be reversed for hundreds or maybe thousands of years. The publication comes less than three months before the UK hosts a key climate summit, known as COP26, in Glasgow. Climate report is 'code red for humanity' Follow live reaction to climate report A really simple guide to climate change Five things we have learned from IPCC report Mr Johnson said: ""Today's report makes for sobering reading, and it is clear that the next decade is going to be pivotal to securing the future of our planet. ""We know what must be done to limit global warming - consign coal to history and shift to clean energy sources, protect nature and provide climate finance for countries on the frontline."" The UK government, whichhas adopted a 2035 deadline for a 78% emissions cut,is due to publish its strategy on cutting UK emissions to zero overall by 2050 this autumn. Net zero means cutting carbon emissions as far as possible then balancing out any remaining releases, for example by tree planting. ""The UK is leading the way, decarbonising our economy faster than any country in the G20 over the last two decades,"" the prime minister said. ""I hope today's IPCC report will be a wake-up call for the world to take action now, before we meet in Glasgow in November for the critical COP26 summit."" The UK has already drastically reduced the use of coal, with consumption falling from 61 million tonnes in 2013 to eight million tonnes last year. But the country remains dependent on other fossil fuels such as natural gas, which provides most home heating and about 40% of electricity. The Climate Change Committee, the UK's independent adviser on tackling global warming, saysthe UK has adequate policies for only two of 21 key areas,externalin eliminating carbon emissions. The government faces challenges both on the international stage and closer to home. The biggest will be to persuade the international community to sign up to meaningful measures in Glasgow at COP26. Some 70% of the world's economy has signed up to a net zero target - ministers want that to be higher. They are looking at the G20 in particular to drive change. At home, an increasing number of Tory MPs are worried about the cost of the UK's own targets. Will the infrastructure be in place to support the mass use of electric cars? Who will pay for more expensive boilers in homes? Answering some of those concerns won't be easy. The Treasury is said to be aware of the need to avoid ""extortionate costs"" for low-income families. Ministers want to bring costs down through investment, incentives and mass production. But the specifics will matter to our pockets and our politics. The report said the world would reach or exceed temperature rises of 1.5C - seen as a threshold beyond which the worst impacts of global warming will be felt - over the next two decades. Almost every nation on Earth signed up to the goals of the Paris climate agreement in 2015, which aims to keep the rise in global temperatures well below 2C this century and to pursue efforts to keep it under 1.5C. Alok Sharma, COP26 president, said one of the key messages of the report was that ""the future is not yet written"" and 1.5C was still an achievable goal, although retreating fast. This video can not be played Alok Sharma says ""we need far more in terms of action"" He said based on the conversations he had had, there was ""a clear desire"" among governments to ""keep the 1.5C within reach"". But he said far more was needed in terms of action, adding ""the cost of inaction on climate change is far greater than the cost of action"". Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the report confirmed that the extreme weather events in recent months were ""only going to become more frequent"" and urgent action was needed. ""The biggest threat we now face is not climate denial but climate delay,"" he said. ""Those who, like our prime minister, acknowledge there is a problem, but simply don't have the scale of ambition required to match the moment. ""Our communities and planet can no longer afford the inaction of this government, who are failing to treat the crisis with the seriousness it deserves."" This video can not be played Sir Keir Starmer calls for a ""coalition of countries"" ahead of COP26 to tackle climate change. Labour wants to seea Â£30bn investment in low-carbon industryto support 400,000 jobs. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon told ITV's Good Morning Britain she would be writing to the prime minister to encourage more co-operation between the devolved UK governments in light of the IPCC publication, which she described as ""a grim wake-up call"". But climate campaigners, Scottish Greens and Scottish Labour have called on her to oppose plans to extract more fossil fuels from the Cambo oil field near Shetland, which they said would result in the release of an estimated 135 million extra tonnes of carbon in its lifetime. Minister urges Tory MPs to back PM's climate plan Second-to-last coal-fired power station to close How serious is the government about COP26? The SNP has maintained that the issue is solely a matter for the UK government. The UK government also faced criticism after initially opting not to intervene in a company's plans for a new coking coal mine in Cumbria. It later reversed the decision and a minister will have the final say on the project, after a public inquiry is held next month. This video can not be played BBC Reality Check explains how to cut your carbon footprint Friends of the Earth climate campaigner Tony Bosworth said the prime minister's pledge to consign coal to history ""should mean all coal"" and the prime minister must make clear the mine will not be allowed. Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey said that as hosts of COP26, the UK needs to lead the world in tackling the climate crisis but ""Boris Johnson's dither and delay is costing us time we cannot afford, with drastic consequences"". Green Party Deputy Leader Amelia Womack said ""this must be the moment the government finally realises we are in an emergency"", urging the introduction of a global carbon tax as ""the most powerful way of rapidly eliminating fossil fuels"". Coal mine plan to be re-examined Climate change, a coalmine and a town that needs jobs Climate scientist Dr Michael Byrne, a contributing author to the report, said the study was ""particularly significant"" as it was the first to link extreme weather events to human activities. ""That evidence was inconclusive back in 2013, at the time of the previous IPCC report; now it's irrefutable."" He said to slow and stop global warming, emissions of greenhouse gases needed to be ""rapidly reduced"" to net zero, but he added: ""The UK and Scottish targets of net zero by 2050 and 2045 are not fast enough, we have to be more ambitious. ""Let's hope our political leaders, as they gear up to COP26 in Glasgow this November, take heed.""

"Environment Minister Zac Goldsmith has urged Conservative MPs to back the government's net zero carbon target following the publication of the UN report on climate change. Lord Goldsmith has said today'sreport from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)""makes appalling reading"". Its release comes less than three months before a key global climate summit in Glasgow known asCOP26. But a small group of rebel Tory MPs, led by Craig McKinlay, say they fear the costs of tackling climate change will harm poor families. The environment minister told the BBC the IPCC report ""adds to the urgency and importance of making this COP a turning point. ""The alarm bells couldn't be clearer or louder. We really need to get behind it,"" Lord Goldsmith said. Time nearly up to stop climate catastrophe - Sharma The activist entrepreneurs running zero-waste shops Live: Sea level rises, other changes irreversible, UN warns The government has consistently stated that poorer households will be helped to get low-carbon, cosy homes. But it hasn't yet come up with a plan to make that happen, with its Buildings Strategy delayed until the autumn. The target of net zero emissions by 2050 was in the Conservative's 2019 general election manifesto. But former cabinet minister Esther McVey is one of the Tory MPs worried about the cost of changing boilers and insulating homes. She said: âWhat I would never want to do is bankrupt the country. We don't go green and go red as a country at the same time."" Lord Lawson, former Conservative chancellor and long-term climate change âscepticâ told the prime minister:  âThe [advisory] Committee on Climate Change has shown you some extraordinary estimates of the cost of decarbonising the economy â extraordinary in the sense of being highly implausible.â Last week four articles authored by Conservatives appeared in newspapers on the same day, suggesting a co-ordinated, albeit small, anti-green initiative. Lord Goldsmithre-tweeted,externalan accusation by the head of Natural England, Tony Juniper, that a campaign is underway to sabotage COP26. Boris Johnson at an event in February to launch the COP26 climate summit. Sam Hall, director of the Conservative Environment Network, which says it has the support of 105 Tory MPs, said the UK has a ""huge opportunity"" to lead the world with its net zero commitment. ""Net zero is expected to be a net job creator overall, a way to level up Britain's industrial heartlands, and a major export opportunity for UK businesses. ""Investing in new industries and infrastructure to deliver net zero will be significantly cheaper than dealing with the economic damage from unchecked climate change. ""By supporting the next set of clean technologies, we can create economies of scale, encourage further innovation, and bring down their costs for households."" So what is the price of going green? TheOffice for Budget Responsibility (OBR),externalhas estimated the total cost of reaching net zero by 2050 could reach Â£1.4 trillion. Lord Lawson, says the true cost could be twice this. But the OBR added that climate targets will cost the government less over the next 30 years than the price of battling the Covid-19 pandemic - if it acts quickly. Whatâs more, it said, the costs of tackling climate change will be less than the costs of paying  for damages from climate change. Richard Hughes, the OBR chair, said: âOur modelling of the dynamics of climate change suggests that early decisive action to tackle carbon emissions could halve the overall fiscal cost of getting to net zero.â Hereâs the problem, though. Tackling climate change requires high up-front costs in all sorts of infrastructure, including heat pumps and home insulation. Many of the investments will save cash in the long run â and reduce reliance on Russian gas â but the question is who will pay for the great transition. Although government sources insist they have no intention of hitting poor families, crucially ministers havenât yet agreed the details of their Heat and Buildings Strategy or their net zero Treasury strategy. Until they produce policies to show how to finance the shift to net zero, they will remain vulnerable to attack. There are still also questions about the scale of the costs. The cost of heat pumps, for instance, should come down when they are installed at scale â as the costs of wind power have tumbled. The Climate Change Committee (CCC) predicts that by 2050 the ultimate cost to the economy would be probably less than 1% of GDP. Members admit, though, that there are inevitably major uncertainties in forecasting the size of the economy by then â or indeed, the cost of technology. The CCC has been told by the Information Tribunal to show its workings by next month. If backbench Conservatives attack the findings it will heap pressure on Boris Johnson as he prepares for the climate summit. He aims to show the world that the UK can decarbonise at an acceptable cost. Stark warnings from the new report from the IPCC of the costs of inaction will strengthen his case.

"Groupon, the online discounter, has been ordered by the UK's competition watchdog to improve the way it treats its customers or face legal action.

In some cases, shoppers are offered Groupon ""credits"" instead of the goods and services they paid for. Groupon said it continues to ""cooperate fully with the CMA"". The watchdog said Groupon must make ""swift"" changes to how it deals with customers to ""ensure that it is complying with consumer protection law"". A spokeswoman for Groupon said: ""We take the outcome of the investigation very seriously and will be carefully reviewing the CMA's findings."" The CMA launched a new investigation into the coupon platform in April and found instances there the company was ""potentially breaking consumer protection law"".

"This video can not be played Laura Nuttall says she felt ""honoured"" that Peter Kay would help her fundraise A cancer patient who inspired comedian Peter Kay's return to the stage has said she feels ""really honoured"" by the ""amazing"" comic. The Bolton starplayed his first gigs in four yearsto raise money for Laura Nuttall's treatment for brain cancer. Thousands of fans gave him a standing ovation at the two charity shows at the Manchester Apollo on Saturday. ""I've never in my life had a standing ovation when I came on,"" he joked. ""I'm going to go away for four more years."" He was hosting two Q&A sessions, called Doing it for Laura, at the 3,500-capacity venue. Laura Nuttall with her mother Nicola and father Mark before Saturday's shows Ms Nuttall, 20, of Barrowford in Lancashire, said Kay used to work with her father at Granada Television and got in touch after seeing her story onBBC North West Tonight. ""He phoned up my dad and said what can I do to help. I think my dad was surprised,"" she said. ""I mean you don't expect that, do you? It happened so quick. He said he would ring the Apollo. ""I feel really honoured that he chose to dedicate his first comeback performance to me."" Peter Kay is one of the UK's most popular entertainers The shows, which sold out within 30 minutes last week, marked a rare public appearance for one of the nation's best-loved comedians. Kay described getting back on stage as like ""getting in a hot bath"". In late 2017, the Phoenix Nights starcancelled a tour and all future work projectsdue to ""unforeseen family circumstances"". Ms Nuttall said the show had been ""hilarious and it was just amazing to see all these people turn out and have a laugh"". ""He has such natural talent. It is just amazing to be around him,"" she added. Laura and her sister Gracie appeared on BBC Breakfast to talk about the Manchester gig The University of Manchester studentwas diagnosed with having an aggressive form of brain cancerin October 2018, during her first term at King's College London. Since then, Ms Nuttall, who was in the audience on Saturday,has been undergoing immunotherapyin Germany as one of the few avenues of treatment available, alongside a costly complex cell vaccination programme, with each jab costing Â£27,000. She toldBBC Breakfastshe was 18 ""when I was told I maybe had another 18 months to live"". ""When you are that young and you are told that news, you have to resort to positivity and laughter because sometimes that is all you have."" Peter Kay pictured arriving at the Manchester Apollo on Saturday At the Apollo, her sister Gracie introduced Kay and told the audience their family was ""eternally grateful"" to them for ""potentially saving my sister's life"". ""It has been really hard. It is a really bizarre concept to know that the person who you really love most in the world might not be there at some point,"" Gracie said. ""But, as we say, laughter is the best medicine and you have to keep going."" Nicola Nuttall said her daughter was ""an exceptional person and she deserves to have a long life"", adding: ""She deserves just to get old.""

"The advert is an example of ""premeditated racist stereotyping"", according to restaurant critic and presenter Jay Rayner A restaurant has apologised for a ""culturally insensitive"" ad campaign. The Ivy Asia in Chelsea, west London, posted a video on social media which featured women dressed as geishas being pulled in a rickshaw to the restaurant. Food writer Jay Rayner was among the advert's many critics, describing it as ""premeditated racist stereotyping"". The video has since been deleted. The Ivy chain, best known for its original restaurant in Soho, said it was conducting an internal review. In the advert, women dressed as geishas struggle to get into a rickshaw being pulled by an elderly Asian man. It tips over and they are saved by a martial arts-type figure labelled ""the hero"", who uses superhuman strength to propel them to the restaurant. Once there they struggle to get through the doors with bags of shopping. They then fall through the doors and are stared at by other customers. Allow Twitter content?

"Afghan officials say security forces are still fighting in Kunduz At least 27 children have been killed in Afghanistan in three days amid fierce fighting between the Taliban and government forces, the UN has said. The UN children's agency Unicef said it was shocked by the ""rapid escalation of grave violations against children"". The Taliban have been making major advances across the country as foreign troops withdraw, taking six regional capitals since Friday. They have rejected international calls for a ceasefire. More than 1,000 civilians have been killed as a result of the conflict in the past month. In a statement on Monday, Unicef said the atrocities being committed against children were growing ""higher by the day"". The 27 fatalities were recorded across three provinces - Kandahar, Khost, and Paktia. Some 136 children were also injured in these areas over the past three days, Unicef said. ""Afghanistan has long been one of the worst places on Earth to be a child but in recent weeks and, indeed, the last 72 hours, that's got a lot worse,"" Unicef Afghanistan's Samantha Mort told the BBC. Children have been killed and injured in roadside bombs and in the crossfire. One mother told the group that her family were asleep over the weekend when their home was hit by shrapnel, which started a fire and left her 10-year-old son with ""horrific burns"". Many children are also sleeping outside after fleeing their homes. Unicef has called on all sides to ensure that children are protected. Violence has escalated across Afghanistan now that US-led forces have all but withdrawn following 20 years of military operations. The Taliban have rapidly captured large swathes of countryside, and are now targeting towns and cities. In their most significant gain since May, the Taliban are reported to have overrun the northern city of Kunduz. The city of 270,000 people is considered a gateway to mineral-rich northern provinces. It is in a strategically important location close to the border with Tajikistan, which is used for the smuggling of opium and heroin. It also holds symbolic significance for the Taliban because it was a key northern stronghold before 2001. The militants captured the city in 2015 and again in 2016 but have never been able to hold it for long. Afghan officials say security forces are still fighting in the city. This video can not be played The BBC's Yogita Limaye travelled to Afghanistan's Kunduz province in July The southwestern city of Zaranj was thefirst provincial capital to fall to the groupunder their sweeping offensive. The northern cities of Sheberghan, Sar-e-Pul, Taloqan and Aybak are now also reported to be under Taliban control. The insurgents entered Aybak, the capital of Samangan province, without a fight after community elders asked for the city to be spared more violence, deputy governor Sefatullah Samangani told AFP news agency. ""The governor accepted and withdrew all the forces from the city,"" he said. PROFILE:Who are the Taliban? ANALYSIS:How the Taliban retook half of Afghanistan FROM THE ARCHIVE:Kunduz, the city the Taliban seized Tolo News and Shamshad TV also tweeted that Afghan forces had retreated from the city without fighting. There was no immediate word from the armed forces. Elsewhere, US and Afghan planes have been carrying out airstrikes - the advance of the militants has not been halted, but Afghan officials say dozens of Taliban have died. Heavy fighting has been reported in Pul-e-Khumri and in Mazar-e-Sharif, a trading hub on the border with Uzbekistan. Army commanders say they have pushed back militants from its outskirts. On Monday morning a loud explosion was heard outside police headquarters in the southern city of Lashkar Gah, where the two sides have been fighting for more than a week. Residents said about 20 civilians had been killed in the past two days, and a school and a clinic destroyed. The capture of several cities and ongoing heavy fighting in others has led thousands of civilians to flee. Families, some including young children and pregnant women, have abandoned their homes and headed for the capital Kabul. The US Department of Defense on Monday said the security situation in Afghanistan was ""not going in the right direction"", but that Afghan security forces were capable of fighting the group. ""These are their military forces, these are their provincial capitals, their people to defend and it's really going to come down to the leadership that they're willing to exude here at this particular moment,"" spokesman John Kirby said. From 9/11, to intense fighting on the ground, and now full withdrawal of US-led forces, hereâs what happened. 11 September 2001 Al-Qaeda, led by Osama Bin Laden in Afghanistan, carries out the largest terror attack ever conducted on US soil. Four commercial airliners are hijacked. Two are flown into the World Trade Centre in New York, which collapses. One hits the Pentagon building in Washington, and one crashes into a field in Pennsylvania. Nearly 3,000 people are killed. 7 October 2001 A US-led coalition bombs Taliban and al-Qaeda facilities in Afghanistan. Targets include Kabul, Kandahar and Jalalabad. The Taliban, who took power after a decade-long Soviet occupation was followed by civil war, refuse to hand over Bin Laden. Their air defences and small fleet of fighter aircraft are destroyed. 13 November 2001 The Northern Alliance, a group of anti-Taliban rebels backed by coalition forces, enters Kabul as the Taliban flee the city. By the 13 November 2001, all Taliban have either fled or been neutralised. Other cities quickly fall. 26 January 2004 After protracted negotiations at a “loya jirga” or grand assembly, the new Afghan constitution is signed into law. The constitution paves the way for presidential elections in October 2004. 7 December 2004 Hamid Karzai, the leader of the Popalzai Durrani tribe, becomes the first president under the new constitution. He serves two five-year terms as president. May 2006 British troops arrive in Helmand province, a Taliban stronghold in the south of the country. Their initial mission is to support reconstruction projects, but they are quickly drawn into combat operations. More than 450 British troops lose their lives in Afghanistan over the course of the conflict. 17 February 2009 US President Barack Obama approves a major increase in the number of troops sent to Afghanistan. At their peak, they number about 140,000. The so-called “surge” is modelled on US strategy in Iraq where US forces focussed on protecting the civilian population as well as killing insurgent fighters. 2 May 2011 The leader of al-Qaeda is killed in an assault by US Navy Seals on a compound in Abbottabad in Pakistan. Bin Ladenâs body is removed and buried at sea. The operation ends a 10-year hunt led by the CIA. Â The confirmation that Bin Laden had been living on Pakistani soil fuels accusations in the US that Pakistan is an unreliable ally in the war on terror. 23 April 2013 The founder of the Taliban, Mullah Mohammed Omar, dies. His death is kept secret for more than two years. According to Afghan intelligence, Mullah Omar dies of health problems at a hospital in the Pakistani city of Karachi. Pakistan denies that he was in the country. 28 December 2014 At a ceremony in Kabul, Nato ends its combat operations in Afghanistan. With the surge now over, the US withdraws thousands of troops. Â Most of those who remain focus on training and supporting the Afghan security forces. 2015 The Taliban launch a series of suicide attacks, car bombings and other assaults. The parliament building in Kabul, and the city of Kunduz are attacked. Islamic State militants begin operations in Afghanistan. 25 January 2019 Afghan President Ashraf Ghani says more than 45,000 members of his countryâs security forces have been killed since he became leader in 2014. The figure is far higher than previously thought. 29 February 2020 The US and the Taliban sign an “agreement for bringing peace” to Afghanistan, in Doha, Qatar. The US and Nato allies agree to withdraw all troops within 14 months if the militants uphold the deal. 13 April 2021 US president Joe Biden announces that all US troops will leave Afghanistan by 11 September 2021. 16 August 2021 In just over a month, the Taliban sweep across Afghanistan, taking control of towns and cities all over the country, including Kabul. Afghan security forces collapse in the face of the Taliban advance. Who are the Taliban? Taliban seize second regional capital in two days From Afghan interpreter to safety in the UK.

"Gemma and Kate Fox welcomed their son Nye in May A same-sex couple who recently had their first child are calling for official forms to be more inclusive. Kate and Gemma Fox, from Exeter, have encountered numerous forms they cannot fill in because they only offer space for the names of a mother and a father. They include on Devon County Council's website, at their GP surgery and in the red book - the personal child health record given to all new parents. Since being contacted by the BBC, all three have said they will make changes. Kate Fox, a lecturer at Plymouth Marjon University, said: ""It's basically everywhere. ""I don't think we've come across a single thing so far that has not been super heteronormative."" Heteronormative is defined by Oxford English Dictionary,externalas designating, or based on a world view which regards gender roles as fixed to biological sex and heterosexuality as the normal and preferred sexual orientation. Devon County Council changed its online form after being contacted by the BBC and a spokesman said he was ""grateful to the couple for alerting us to this matter"" After their son Nye was born, the couple tried to make an appointment to register his birth using Devon County Council's website but could not. The council said the form had since been changed and other documentation checked to ensure this did not happen again. A spokesman said: ""We apologise profusely for this oversight and are grateful to the couple for alerting us to this matter."" The red book, which is given to all new parents, only has space for the name of a mother and a father The couple were also frustrated when they received their red book as it only offers space for the names of a mother and father. The Department for Health and Social Care said: ""The red book would be updated as part of our commitment to ensuring any disparities experienced by those in the wider LGBT community are acknowledged and their needs are considered throughout the health system."" The red book is currently being updated and digitised by the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health and the new version is due to be made available from 2023. Dr Fox said they took a sheet of paper to hospital with them explaining who they were to avoid having to deal with assumptions Dr Fox said: ""The attempt to have a child is often a battle for same-sex couples... and then when you've had a baby and it's super celebratory and then the first pieces of paper you are given say 'mother and father' and it's just, you're almost worn out by the time you have had a baby. ""We certainly were exhausted with the whole thing and then you think I just don't want every little piece of official paper to have to be a battle."" In July, the couple attempted to register Nye at their local GP surgery, St Thomas Health Centre in Exeter. The online form for registration only had boxes for mother and father and when they called to point this out, Dr Fox said they were told it could be sorted when they brought their son in. Kate Fox said the forms at her GP surgery do not represent all families Dr Fox said the paper form had the same wording and they were told to cross out father and write mother. She said more shockingly, they were handed another form to register a child at the surgery and that form asked for ethnicity but only offered white ethnicities as an option and under religion, only Christian religions. ""I think that's what we are saying... [is] if your form does not accept or represent our family then your form doesn't work,"" she said. ""It's not that we're being difficult it's that your form is wrong."" Kayleah Logan, co-founder of the Queer Parenting Partnership, said that every month they see couples expressing their ""upset at being invalidated as a parent"". ""It's not just representation, it's almost erasure of LGBT families,"" Ms Logan added. Nye, whose full name is Aneirin, was born in May Dr Alice Godwin, GP partner at St Thomas Medical Group, said the forms were a ""serious oversight"" and added: ""We wholeheartedly agree that official forms should be fully inclusive, and we are very sorry for the distress this caused to Kate and Gemma."" She said: ""The paper version of the form they were mistakenly given was an old version, which should have been destroyed when it was updated. ""We have made sure that no other copies remain and are reviewing all our documentation to make sure it is inclusive."" Dr Godwin said the online form had also been changed and added: ""We pride ourselves on being an open and inclusive practice and these mistakes are simply not acceptable."" Jo Turl, from NHS Devon Clinical Commissioning Group, said it would be contacting all GP practices in Devon to ask them to review their documentation. She said: ""Addressing inequalities is a priority for us so we take this matter very seriously."" Dr Fox called on anyone who wants to be an LGBT ally to take action by finding out what the forms at their surgery say. She added: ""Don't let it be the next same-sex couple or gender non-conforming person or whoever who comes into contact with these documents who has to be the one who has the fight."" A child can only have two legal parents but there is no limit to the number of people who can share parental responsibility Since 2009, same-sex female couples can include both their names on their child's birth certificate when registering the birth Male couples must get a parental order from the court before they can be registered as parents Source: www.gov.uk Follow BBC News South West onTwitter,external,Facebook,externalandInstagram,external.

"Siemens Gamesa's current blade factory will be doubled in size A wind turbine blade factory in Hull is to be doubled in size after the government confirmed it would provide financial support for the expansion. Siemens Gamesa said the Â£186m upgrade to its Alexandra Dock site, the UK's largest offshore wind manufacturing facility, would create 200 jobs. The scheme,first outlined in February, is set to be complete by 2023. It will receive a grant from a Â£160m fund but the government has not yet revealed the exact amount. The Hull plant, which has manufactured more than 1,500 offshore wind turbine blades since it opened in 2016, currently employs about 1,000 people. The giant turbines are used in wind farms being constructed in the North Sea, as well as exported around the world. They are currently being supplied to the 1.4-gigawatt Hornsea Two project off the Yorkshire coast which will be the world's largest offshore wind power plant, powering the equivalent of 1.3 million homes. The expansion will help Siemens Gamesa prepare for the next generation of wind turbine blades Hull City Council leader Daren Hale said the decision was ""fantastic news"" for the city, which he said was at the ""forefront of the green economy revolution"". ""This additional Â£186m investment will create hundreds more jobs, and the expansion will support the recovery of the city post-Covid,"" he added. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who has previously pledged topower every homein the UK via offshore farms, said: ""The Humber region embodies the UK's green industrial revolution, with new investment into developing the next generation of wind turbines set to create new jobs, export opportunities and clean power across the country. ""With less than 100 days to go until the climate summit Cop26, we need to see more countries embracing new technologies, building green industries and phasing out coal power for a sustainable future."" Clark MacFarlane, Siemens Gamesa's UK managing director, said: ""Our investment in our existing offshore blade factory, logistics, and harbour facilities in Hull has been a key driver of the growth of the UK's world-leading offshore wind industry."" Meanwhile, it was announced that a further Â£78m will be invested by GRI Renewable Industries (GRI) to build a wind turbine tower factory at the Able Marine Energy Park, at Killinghome, North Lincolnshire. The company said it would create 260 jobs at the site which lies on the other side of the Humber estuary. Rob Waltham, leader of North Lincolnshire Council, said he was delighted the company had chosen Killinghome as its base. ""This latest development will create even more well-paid sustainable jobs - helping to create a more prosperous future,"" he said. GRI is the second company to commit to the planned energy park at Killinghome Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said the Humber region was ""vitally important"" for the growth of the UK's offshore wind industry. ""Our announcement backed by private investment will give a boost to this important industrial heartland, creating and supporting thousands of good quality jobs across the region while ensuring it is on the frontline of developing the next generation of offshore wind turbines.""

"Art of Zero Living store owner Vita Viskackaite fills a jar with organic rice from a dispenser In 2017, National Trust colleagues Stacey Fordham, 43, and Lidia Rueda Losada, 37, had a casual chat about how they wished everything they bought wasn't packaged in so much plastic. The conversation spurred an idea to open a shop selling food and household items entirely without packaging, and in March 2018 they took the plunge. They opened Zero Green, believed to be the second store in the country and first in Bristol. Zero Green sells more than 1,000 product lines: including pasta, grains and pulses in dispensers; frozen vegan pasties; eco-cleaning products; cosmetics and sustainable non-plastic toiletries. Consumers are encouraged to bring their own containers or use recycled jars and packaging to take their shopping home. Seven days without single-use plastic 'Clothes should float in and out of our lives' Plastic impact of pandemic 'will last forever' ""We put in just over Â£30,000 to start from our own savings,"" says Ms Fordham, who also previously worked for Sainsbury's. Lidia Rueda Losada and Stacey Fordham met while working at the National Trust's head office in Swindon ""You have to really believe in what you're doing in order to do this, otherwise it's very hard."" The UK's first organic zero-waste shop was Earth.Food.Love in Totnes, set up by former Manchester United footballer Richard Eckersley and his wife Nicola in 2017. The pioneering couple are credited by the zero-waste community with sharing how they established their business, offering full supplier lists, business plans and pricing lists for free, online. Ms Fordham and Ms Rueda Losada used their tips. But there was a lot of trial and error, they say, plus additional challenges as they were determined to live by their green principles. ""It was really important for us to not buy virgin wood or racking off a shelf - everything we used in the shop was upcycled. ""We went to electrical companies and got big cable drums, upcycled pallets and salvaged scaffolding boards,"" says Ms Fordham. They were ""really lucky"", she adds, as within six months Zero Green had broken even and eventually moved to a retail space four times bigger. Zero Green's owners say they have followed their principles in their business, including using recycled materials for shop fixtures ""The popularity of it all was more than we expected... demand was so high we physically couldn't fit people into the shop."" Before the pandemic, the store was taking in Â£12,000 a week in sales, but now revenues have fallen by two thirds and they have had to lay off half their staff. The online community of zero-waste shop owners estimates there are now roughly 320 zero-waste shops in the UK, but this also includes community interest companies (CICs) and organic wholefood shops. According to consumer expert Kate Hardcastle, it is difficult to collect official data because many shops go bust and fail. However, the community is growing steadily online and free advice is given to new entrepreneurs ona popular Facebook group,external. Vita Viskackaite, 43, opened the Art of Zero Living store in Greenwich, London, in April. She left a successful career in logistics with restaurant chain Itsu to run the shop, while her partner Justas pays the bills with his earnings. They have invested Â£55,000 from savings. Vita Viskackaite: ""My husband said 'why don't you open your own shop?'"" ""Two years ago, I read a book called Zero Waste Home by Bea Johnson and it captured me, as it wasn't just about saving the environment - it was also about saving money and improving your life,"" she says. Inspired, Ms Viskackaite got rid of 30% of everything she owned and began shopping at a zero-waste shop in north London, but she had to take two buses each way to do her weekly shopping. ""Then coronavirus came and I was very sad because I didn't have anyone locally to buy from,"" she says. ""So, my husband said to me, 'If you feel so strongly about this, why don't you open your own shop?'"" In June, the couple made Â£10,000 in sales. After paying Â£9,000 in overheads including stock and rent, they have a Â£1,000 profit. ""I hope that one day, there will be many more people who join the zero-waste lifestyle and avoid buying products using single-use plastic just because it's convenient,"" stresses Ms Viskackaite. ""We were never planning to become rich out of this, we just wanted to have peace of mind."" Research from environmental consultancy, Eunomia, shows mean annual turnover for EU zero-waste shops is around â¬170,000 (Â£144,000) based on a sample size of 268 packaging-free shops in 10 EU countries. And there is evidence shop turnover has increased over the past three years. Burgess Hill mayor Anne Eves and council leader Robert Eggleston are trying to encourage more green businesses ""Covid has jolted social consciousness, a retailer told me,"" says Ms Hardcastle. ""In our survey of 140 people, 85% of people said they care more about the environment than they did 12 months ago."" In Sussex, Burgess Hill mayor Anne Eves and council leader Robert Eggleston say there is definitely a movement to rejuvenate high streets with green businesses, like zero-waste shops and eco-fashion retailers. Since being elected in 2019, they have negotiated rent reductions with commercial landlords and divided up large empty retail units. Start-ups pay lower rents and some avoid business rates altogether. ""We want to nurture these businesses. At some point they will spread their wings and fly, and we want to support them so they have a chance,"" says Mr Eggleston. Ms Eves, a Green councillor, says sustainability matters a lot to her constituents. She set upa monthly repair cafeto help people fix their electronic gadgets, clothes and bedding that has been very popular, and thinks every High Street should have one. ""We are gradually changing things... we'd like to see this town thriving as it was 20 years ago."" Architecture graduate Lydia Wilson, 26, started Waste Not Want Not in Bridport, Dorset, three years ago. ""I wanted something which enabled people to live waste-free but also [to] start a conversation on a much wider scale on ethics and organic living,"" she says. Lydia Wilson says she has learned a lot from her community and it has given her crucial support Ms Wilson took out Â£45,000 in personal loans to start her business. She offers more than 700 products and her biggest customer base is in the 35-50s age group. It took 18 months for her to break even. Prior to Covid she took Â£12,000 a year in salary, but now everything is being ploughed back into the store. She says the journey has been really hard, running the business all by herself, and is thankful that her customers have rallied round. ""I know now that I've got a community of people who really want the shop to be here, and would do what they could to make sure the shop stays. ""That's something I might call upon - it's a limited company but I want to transition it into a community benefit society or a co-operative."" Ms Fordham and Ms Viskackaite both agree that their communities are crucial. Lydia Wilson says providing a space for her customers to be heard and exchange ideas is crucial ""I've learned it's OK to ask for help and be honest and open with your customers and staff,"" says Ms Fordham. ""Coming from the big bad business world you never admitted those things, but it's lovely to get advice and help."" However, there are not yet enough such businesses to enable consumers to ""shop economically"" in the UK and many consumers lack information about them, stresses Ms Hardcastle. Yet she still thinks zero-waste shops have an edge on supermarkets, some of which are now trialling similar ideas. ""The community is incredibly important to the success of zero waste shops and difficult to replicate,"" she says. ""Is it a sustainable business model? Yes because interest is beginning to grow but it has to be run by people who are committed to the cause.""

"Former Business Secretary Alok Sharma is now leading COP26, the climate summit in Glasgow in November The world is ""dangerously close"" to running out of time to stop a climate change catastrophe, the UK government's climate chief Alok Sharma has said. Mr Sharma - who is leading COP26, the climate summit hosted by the UK this year - said the effects were already clear with floods, fires and heatwaves. ""We can't afford to wait two years, five years, 10 years - this is the moment,""he told the Observer.,external But he did not condemn the government for allowing more fossil fuel projects. And he defended his decision to travel tomore than 30 countries in seven months. Mr Sharma's interview with the Observer comes ahead ofa major report being released on Mondayfrom the United Nations' climate change researchers. The report is set to be the strongest statement yet from the UN group on the science of climate change - and will likely give details about how the world's oceans, ice caps and land will change in the next decades. The summary has been approved in a process involving scientists and representatives of 195 governments, which - having signed off on the findings - will be under pressure to take more action at COP26 in November. Doug Parr, chief scientist with Greenpeace UK, said ""world leaders have done a terrible job of listening"" to warnings about climate change. ""This year, this has to change. We don't need more pledges, commitments and targets - we need real action right here right now."" Wildfires are currently raging in Greece, forcing thousands to evacuate their homes - and fireshave also been burning in Turkeyand California in the US. This summer,western Europe also sawits worst flooding in decades, which killed dozens of people. What is COP26 and what needs to be agreed? A really simple guide to climate change Mr Sharma said if urgent action was not taken, the consequences would be ""catastrophic"". ""I don't think there's any other word for it,"" he said. ""You're seeing on a daily basis what is happening across the world. Last year was the hottest on record, the last decade the hottest decade on record."" This video can not be played What is climate change? He added: ""We're seeing the impacts across the world - in the UK or the terrible flooding we've seen across Europe and China, or forest fires, the record temperatures that we've seen in North America. Every day you will see a new high being recorded in one way or another across the world."" Mr Sharma said the report released on Monday is ""going to be the starkest warning yet that human behaviour is alarmingly accelerating global warming"". ""I don't think we're out of time but I think we're getting dangerously close to when we might be out of time. We will see [from the IPCC] a very, very clear warning that unless we act now, we will unfortunately be out of time."" ""Africa has been waiting for the rest of the world to catch up and act on climate change for years,"" Fredrick Njehu, Christian Aid's senior climate change and energy adviser for Africa, highlighting the ""changing rainfall patterns or overbearing heat"" endured by the continent in recent years. He added: ""The important thing now is that rich world governments make up for lost time and act quickly to reduce emissions and deliver promised financial support for the vulnerable."" Glasgow is set to host the COP26 summit in November - which is the UN climate change conference. The summit is seen as vital if climate change is to be brought under control, and leaders from 196 countries will meet to try and agree action. But campaigners have accused the UK of hypocrisy, as there are plans to tap a new oil field off Shetland. The government has also said more oil and gas wells can be drilled in the North Sea, and there are plans for a new coal mine in Cumbria. Earlier this year, the global energy watchdog the International Energy Agency said there cannot be any new investment in oil, gas or coal projects if we want to limit global warming to 1.5C. Experts say the impacts of climate change are far more severe when the increase is greater than 1.5C. Mr Sharma refused to criticise the government's plan for the projects, saying: ""Future [fossil fuel] licences are going to have to adhere to the fact we have committed to go to net zero by 2050 in legislation. ""There will be a climate check on any licences."" This video can not be played Climate change: How 1.5C could change the world Mr Sharma's interview comes after he was criticised for flying abroad for meetings - and visiting more than 30 countries in seven months. However, since then some environmental campaigners including Greenpeace have defended him, saying face-to-face meetings are important to persuade other nations to tackle climate change. Mr Sharma told the Observer that in-person meetings were ""incredibly vital and actually impactful"". ""It makes a vital difference, to build those personal relationships which are going to be incredibly important as we look to build consensus,"" he said. It also emerged in the Sunday Mirror that,externalForeign Secretary Dominic Raab did not self-isolate after returning from France, which was on the amber plus list meaning all arrivals must quarantine. A government spokesman said it was Mr Raab's job to represent the UK abroad and he followed Covid guidelines on return.

"Ocado Group is the firm that provides the online grocer's technology platform Staff at Ocado Group, the tech firm behind the online grocer, can now work abroad remotely for one month a year. The move comes as firms rethink workplace policies after the pandemic. The firm's chief people officer, Claire Ainscough, toldthe Times newspape,externalr that its employees were still being encouraged to return to the office. Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng told the BBC that flexible working was ""here to stay"", but he would be urging his team to come in more. Government employees have been asked to make a ""gradual return"" to Whitehall, but Mr Kwarteng is calling for them to work from the office two to three days a week. Under the Ocado Group scheme, staff who worked from home during the pandemic will be able to do their jobs remotely, subject to certain restrictions, from locations including outside the UK. The scheme does not apply to Ocado Retail, the online supermarket, which is jointly owned by Ocado Group and Marks & Spencer. Ms Ainscough said this answered a ""top question"" from staff, particularly those who had families abroad and did not want to use up their leave by spending time with them. Ocado Group said it wanted to offer ""a balance and choice"" in response to requests from staff. Meanwhile, government departments have seen just a few people go back to the office, despite a recommendation that they should make a ""gradual return"" over the summer. Asked about home working, Mr Kwarteng told the BBC: ""I think flexible working is something that is here to stay, but I've always said that I think it's up to employers and employees to come to their own arrangements, depending on the needs of the company and the needs of the business. ""I don't think it makes sense to have a government diktat telling people exactly how many hours they're going to spend in the office and exactly how many hours they're going to spend at home. I'll be encouraging [civil servants] to come in, but of course again there'll be a degree of flexibility and that's what we're working to achieve."" One unnamed Cabinet minister,externaltold the Daily Mail that civil servants who refused to return to their offices should have their pay cut. ButMr Kwarteng rejected the idea, saying it would set colleagues against each other. Should I be working at home or going to the office? 'Hybrid working will become the norm' A number of other companies have announced policies on what has become known as ""hybrid working"" - allowing staff to work partly from home and partly in the office. Supermarket giant Asdahas said it will allow staff at its head offices to ""select the best location to do their job"", including home, head office or even a store or depot. However, not all companies plan to embrace a hybrid approach.Investment bank Goldman Sachshas said it wants people to come back into the office once restrictions have ended. At the same time, there is evidence that companies are facing challenges in recruiting new staff as pandemic restrictions continue to ease. Stephen Ingham, chief executive of recruitment firm Page Group, told the BBC that in some cases, companies were now outbidding each other for staff. ""Talking to a lot of our clients, right the way through their businesses, from the top to the bottom, they are finding it very difficult to hire people and I think there are a lot of vacancies out there,"" he said. Mr Ingham added that companies were also ""doing their best to keep existing staff"", so that existing salaries were being ""elevated to try to persuade staff to stay where they are"". ""We are now starting to see wage inflation,"" he said. Zoom bets billions on home working continuing What are the new working from home rules?

"The advert is an example of ""premeditated racist stereotyping"", according to restaurant critic and presenter Jay Rayner A restaurant has apologised for a ""culturally insensitive"" ad campaign. The Ivy Asia in Chelsea, west London, posted a video on social media which featured women dressed as geishas being pulled in a rickshaw to the restaurant. Food writer Jay Rayner was among the advert's many critics, describing it as ""premeditated racist stereotyping"". The video has since been deleted. The Ivy chain, best known for its original restaurant in Soho, said it was conducting an internal review. In the advert, women dressed as geishas struggle to get into a rickshaw being pulled by an elderly Asian man. It tips over and they are saved by a martial arts-type figure labelled ""the hero"", who uses superhuman strength to propel them to the restaurant. Once there they struggle to get through the doors with bags of shopping. They then fall through the doors and are stared at by other customers. Allow Twitter content?

"Social media is rife with posts disparaging the vaccine hesitant – but these reactions to a complex and nuanced issue are doing more harm than good. As we head towards the end of another extraordinary year, BBC Future is taking a look back at some of our favourite stories for our ""Best of 2021"" collection.Discover more of our picks here. There should be no doubt about it: Covid-19 vaccines are saving lives.  Consider some recent statistics from the UK. In a study tracking more than 200,000 people, nearly every single participant haddeveloped antibodies against the viruswithin two weeks of their second dose. And despite initial worries that the current vaccines may be less effective against the Delta variant, analyses suggest that both theAstraZeneca and the Pfizer-BioNTech jabs reduce hospitalisation rates by 92-96%. As many health practitioners have repeated, the risks of severe side effects from a vaccine aretiny in comparison to the risk of the disease itself.  Yet a sizeable number of people are still reluctant to get the shots. According to a recent report by the International Monetary Fund, thatranges from around 10-20% of people in the UK to around 50% in Japan and 60% in France.  The result is becoming something of a culture war on social media, with many online commentators claiming that the vaccine hesitant are simply ignorant or selfish. But psychologists who specialise in medical decision-making argue these choices are often the result of many complicating factors that need to be addressed sensitively, if we are to have any hope of reaching population-level immunity.  The 5Cs  First, some distinctions. While it is tempting to assume that anyone who refuses a vaccine holds the same beliefs, the fears of most vaccine hesitant people should not be confused with thebizarre theories of staunch anti-vaxxers. ""They're very vocal, and they have a strong presence offline and online,"" says Mohammad Razai at the Population Health Research Institute, St George's, University of London, who has written about thevarious psychological and social factors that can influence people's decision-makingaround vaccines. ""But they’re a very small minority.""  You might also like:  The vast majority of vaccine-hesitant peopledo not have a political agendaand are not committed to ananti-scientific cause: they are simply undecided about their choice to take the injection.  The good news is that many peoplewho were initially hesitant are changing their mind. ""But even a delay is considered a threat to health because viral infections spread very quickly,"" says Razai. This would have been problematic if we were still dealing with the older variants of the virus, but the higher transmissibility of the new Delta variant has increased the urgency of reaching as many people as quickly as possible.  Fortunately, scientists began studying vaccine hesitancy long before Sars-Cov-2 was first identified in Wuhan in December 2019, and they have explored various models which attempt to capture the differences in people's health behaviour. One of the most promising is known as the 5Cs model, which considers the following psychological factors: Confidence:the person's trust in the vaccines efficacy and safety, the health services offering them, and the policy makers deciding on their rollout Complacency:whether or not the person considers the disease itself to be a serious risk to their health Calculation:the individual's engagement in extensive information searching to weigh up the costs and benefits Constraints (or convenience): how easy it is for the person in question to access the vaccine Collective responsibility: the willingness to protect others from infection, through one's own vaccination In 2018, Cornelia Betsch at the University of Erfurt in Germany and colleagues asked participants to ratea series of statements that measured each of the 5Cs, and then compared the results with their actual uptake of relevant procedures, such as the influenza or the HPV vaccine. Sure enough, they found that the 5Cs could explain a large amount of the variation in people's decisions, and consistently outperformed many other potential predictors – such as questionnaires that focused more exclusively on issues of trust without considering the other factors. In currently unpublished research, Betsch recently used the model to predict people's uptake of the Covid-19 vaccines, and her results so far suggest that the 5Cs model can explain the majority of the variation in people's decisions. There will be other contributing factors, of course. A recent study from the University of Oxford suggests thata fear of needles is a major barrier for around 10% of the population. But the 5Cs approach certainly seems to capture the most common reasons for vaccine hesitancy. Confirmation bias When considering these different factors and the ways they may be influencing people's behaviour, it is also useful to examine the various cognitive biases that are known to sway our perceptions. Consider the first two Cs – theconfidencein the vaccine, thecomplacencyabout the dangers of disease itself. Jessica Saleska at the University of California, Los Angeles points out that humans have two seemingly contradictory tendencies – a ""negativity bias"" and an ""optimism bias"" thatcan each skew people’s appraisals of the risks and benefits.  The negativity bias concerns the way you appraise events beyond your control. ""When you're presented with negative information, that tends to stick in your mind,"" says Saleska. The optimism bias, in contrast, concerns your beliefs about yourself – whether you think you are fitter and healthier than the average person. These biases may work independently, meaning that you may focus on the dangerous side effects of the vaccines while simultaneously believing that you are less likely to suffer from the disease, a combination that would reduce confidence and increase complacency. Then there's the famous confirmation bias, which can also twist people's perceptions of the risks of the virus through the ready availability of misinformation from dubious sources that exaggerate the risks of the vaccines. This reliance on misleading resources means that people who score highly on the ""calculation"" measure of the 5Cs scale – the people who actively look for data – are often more vaccine hesitant than people who score lower. ""If you already think the vaccination could be risky, then you type in 'is this vaccination dangerous?', then all you are going find is the information that confirms your prior view,"" says Betsch. Remember that these psychological tendencies are extremely common. Even if you have accepted the vaccine, they have probably influenced your own decision making in many areas of life. To ignore them, and to assume that the vaccine hesitant are somehow wilfully ignorant, is itself a foolish stance. Nor should we forget the many social factors that might influence people's uptake – the ""constraints/convenience"" factor in the 5Cs. Quite simply, the perception that a vaccine is difficult to access will only discourage people who are already sitting on the fence. When we spoke, Betsch suggested that thismight have slowed the uptake in Germany, which has a very complicated system to identify who is eligible to receive the vaccine at any one time. People would respond much more quickly, she says, if they received automatic notifications.  Razai agrees that we need to consider the question of convenience, particularly for those in poorer communities who may struggle with the time and expense of the journey to a vaccination centre. ""Travelling to and from that may be a huge issue for most people who are on minimum wage or unemployment benefits,"" he says. That's why it's often best for the vaccines to be administered in local community centres. ""I think there has been anecdotal evidence of it being more successful in places of worship, mosque, gurdwaras, and churches.""  Finally, we need to be aware of the context of people's decisions, he says – such as the structural racism that might had led certain ethnic groups to have lower overall trust in medical authorities. It is easy to dismiss someone else's decisions if you don't understand the challenges they face in their day-to-day lives. Opening a dialogue So what can be done? There is no easy solution, but health authorities can continue to provide easy-to-digest, accurate information address the major concerns. According toa recent report by Imperial College London's Institute of Global Health Innovation (IGHI), the major barriers continue to be patient's concerns about the side effects and the fears that the vaccines haven’t been adequately tested.  For the former,graphics showing the relative risks of the vaccines, compared to the actual disease, can provide some context. For the latter, Razai suggests that we need more education about the history of the vaccines' development. The use of mRNA in vaccines has been studied for decades, for instance – with long trials testing its safety. This meantthe technique could be quickly adapted for the pandemic. ""None of the technology that has been used would be in any way harmful because we have used these technologies in other areas in healthcare and research,"" Razai says.  Sarah Jones, a doctoral researcher who co-led the IGHI report, suggests a targeted approach will be necessary. ""I would urge governments to stop thinking they can reach the mass of niches out there with one mass-market vaccine message, and work more creatively with many effective communications partners,"" she says. That might involve closer collaborations with the influencer role models within each community, she says, who can provide ""consistent and accurate information"" about the vaccines' risks and benefits. However they choose to deliver the information, health services need to make it clear that they are engaging in an open dialogue, Razai says – rather than simply dismissing them out of hand. ""We have to listen to people's concerns, acknowledge them, and give them information so they can make an informed decision.""  Saleska agrees that it's essential to engage in a two-way conversation – and that's something that we could all learn as we discuss these issues with our friends and family. ""Being respectful and recognising their concerns – I think that could actually be more important than just spitting out the facts or statistics,"" she says. ""A lot of the time, it's more about the personal connection than it is about the actual information that you provide."" *David Robsonis the author of The Intelligence Trap: Why Smart People Do Dumb Things.

"The Ratcliffe-on-Soar power station in Nottinghamshire is one of Britain's two remaining coal-fired power stations Coal needs to be consigned to history to limit global warming, says PM Boris Johnson, describing a UN report on climate change as ""sobering"". He said the world must shift to clean energy and provide finance to help countries at risk from changing climates. Thelandmark studyfound it was ""unequivocal"" that human activity was responsible for global warming. Green campaigners said the UK must halt planned new fossil fuel projects. Despite the call to end the use of coal, the UK is considering plans for a new coking coal mine in Cumbria, as well as proposals to tap a new oil field near Shetland. The report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) - the UN group on the science of climate change - said climate change was already here and causing chaos in some places. Its authors said some of the changes, including rising sea levels, would not be reversed for hundreds or maybe thousands of years. The publication comes less than three months before the UK hosts a key climate summit, known as COP26, in Glasgow. Climate report is 'code red for humanity' Follow live reaction to climate report A really simple guide to climate change Five things we have learned from IPCC report Mr Johnson said: ""Today's report makes for sobering reading, and it is clear that the next decade is going to be pivotal to securing the future of our planet. ""We know what must be done to limit global warming - consign coal to history and shift to clean energy sources, protect nature and provide climate finance for countries on the frontline."" The UK government, whichhas adopted a 2035 deadline for a 78% emissions cut,is due to publish its strategy on cutting UK emissions to zero overall by 2050 this autumn. Net zero means cutting carbon emissions as far as possible then balancing out any remaining releases, for example by tree planting. ""The UK is leading the way, decarbonising our economy faster than any country in the G20 over the last two decades,"" the prime minister said. ""I hope today's IPCC report will be a wake-up call for the world to take action now, before we meet in Glasgow in November for the critical COP26 summit."" The UK has already drastically reduced the use of coal, with consumption falling from 61 million tonnes in 2013 to eight million tonnes last year. But the country remains dependent on other fossil fuels such as natural gas, which provides most home heating and about 40% of electricity. The Climate Change Committee, the UK's independent adviser on tackling global warming, saysthe UK has adequate policies for only two of 21 key areas,externalin eliminating carbon emissions. The government faces challenges both on the international stage and closer to home. The biggest will be to persuade the international community to sign up to meaningful measures in Glasgow at COP26. Some 70% of the world's economy has signed up to a net zero target - ministers want that to be higher. They are looking at the G20 in particular to drive change. At home, an increasing number of Tory MPs are worried about the cost of the UK's own targets. Will the infrastructure be in place to support the mass use of electric cars? Who will pay for more expensive boilers in homes? Answering some of those concerns won't be easy. The Treasury is said to be aware of the need to avoid ""extortionate costs"" for low-income families. Ministers want to bring costs down through investment, incentives and mass production. But the specifics will matter to our pockets and our politics. The report said the world would reach or exceed temperature rises of 1.5C - seen as a threshold beyond which the worst impacts of global warming will be felt - over the next two decades. Almost every nation on Earth signed up to the goals of the Paris climate agreement in 2015, which aims to keep the rise in global temperatures well below 2C this century and to pursue efforts to keep it under 1.5C. Alok Sharma, COP26 president, said one of the key messages of the report was that ""the future is not yet written"" and 1.5C was still an achievable goal, although retreating fast. This video can not be played Alok Sharma says ""we need far more in terms of action"" He said based on the conversations he had had, there was ""a clear desire"" among governments to ""keep the 1.5C within reach"". But he said far more was needed in terms of action, adding ""the cost of inaction on climate change is far greater than the cost of action"". Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the report confirmed that the extreme weather events in recent months were ""only going to become more frequent"" and urgent action was needed. ""The biggest threat we now face is not climate denial but climate delay,"" he said. ""Those who, like our prime minister, acknowledge there is a problem, but simply don't have the scale of ambition required to match the moment. ""Our communities and planet can no longer afford the inaction of this government, who are failing to treat the crisis with the seriousness it deserves."" This video can not be played Sir Keir Starmer calls for a ""coalition of countries"" ahead of COP26 to tackle climate change. Labour wants to seea Â£30bn investment in low-carbon industryto support 400,000 jobs. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon told ITV's Good Morning Britain she would be writing to the prime minister to encourage more co-operation between the devolved UK governments in light of the IPCC publication, which she described as ""a grim wake-up call"". But climate campaigners, Scottish Greens and Scottish Labour have called on her to oppose plans to extract more fossil fuels from the Cambo oil field near Shetland, which they said would result in the release of an estimated 135 million extra tonnes of carbon in its lifetime. Minister urges Tory MPs to back PM's climate plan Second-to-last coal-fired power station to close How serious is the government about COP26? The SNP has maintained that the issue is solely a matter for the UK government. The UK government also faced criticism after initially opting not to intervene in a company's plans for a new coking coal mine in Cumbria. It later reversed the decision and a minister will have the final say on the project, after a public inquiry is held next month. This video can not be played BBC Reality Check explains how to cut your carbon footprint Friends of the Earth climate campaigner Tony Bosworth said the prime minister's pledge to consign coal to history ""should mean all coal"" and the prime minister must make clear the mine will not be allowed. Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey said that as hosts of COP26, the UK needs to lead the world in tackling the climate crisis but ""Boris Johnson's dither and delay is costing us time we cannot afford, with drastic consequences"". Green Party Deputy Leader Amelia Womack said ""this must be the moment the government finally realises we are in an emergency"", urging the introduction of a global carbon tax as ""the most powerful way of rapidly eliminating fossil fuels"". Coal mine plan to be re-examined Climate change, a coalmine and a town that needs jobs Climate scientist Dr Michael Byrne, a contributing author to the report, said the study was ""particularly significant"" as it was the first to link extreme weather events to human activities. ""That evidence was inconclusive back in 2013, at the time of the previous IPCC report; now it's irrefutable."" He said to slow and stop global warming, emissions of greenhouse gases needed to be ""rapidly reduced"" to net zero, but he added: ""The UK and Scottish targets of net zero by 2050 and 2045 are not fast enough, we have to be more ambitious. ""Let's hope our political leaders, as they gear up to COP26 in Glasgow this November, take heed.""

"A new global agreement - the Glasgow Climate Pact - was reached at the COP26 summit. It aims to reduce the worst impacts of climate change - but some leaders and campaigners say it does not go far enough. The agreement - although not legally binding - will set the global agenda on climate change for the next decade: Emissions It was agreed countries will meet next year to pledge further cuts to emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) - agreenhouse gas which causes climate change. This is to try to keep temperature rises within 1.5C - which scientists say is required to prevent a ""climate catastrophe"". Current pledges, if met, will only limit global warming to about 2.4C. Coal For the first time at a COP conference, there was an explicit plan to reduce use of coal - which is responsible for 40% of annual CO2 emissions. However, countries only agreed a weaker commitment to ""phase down"" rather than ""phase out"" coal after a late intervention by China and India. PM: Climate deal sounds death knell for coal power Evasive words and coal compromise, but deal shows progress Developing countries The agreement pledged to significantly increase money to help poor countries cope with the effects of climate change and make the switch to clean energy. There's also the prospect of a trillion dollar a year fund from 2025 - after a previous pledge for richer countries to provide $100bn (Â£72bn) a year by 2020 was missed. While some observers say the COP26 agreement represented the ""start of a breakthrough"", some African and Latin American countries felt not enough progress was made. Why hasn't climate pledge to poor countries been met? Fossil fuel subsidies World leaders agreed to phase-out subsidies that artificially lower the price of coal, oil, or natural gas. However, no firm dates have been set. How much is still spent supporting oil, coal and gas? A flurry of other announcements were made: The world's biggest CO2 emitters, the US and China,pledged to cooperate more over the next decadein areas including methane emissions and the switch to clean energy. China has previously been reluctant to tackle domestic coal emissions - so this was seen as recognising the need for urgent action. Cautious welcome for US-China climate agreement Why China's climate policy matters to us all Leaders from more than 100 countries - with about 85% of the world's forests -promised to stop deforestationby 2030. This is seen as vital, as trees absorb vast amounts of CO2. Similar initiativeshaven't stopped deforestation, but this one's better funded. However, it's unclear how the pledge will be policed. Ascheme to cut 30% of methane emissions by 2030was agreed by more than 100 countries. Methane is currently responsible for a third of human-generated warming. The big emitters China, Russia and India haven't joined - but it's hoped they will later. Financial organisations controlling $130tnagreed to back ""clean"" technology, such as renewable energy, and direct finance away from fossil fuel-burning industries. The initiative is an attempt to involve private companies in meeting net zero targets. However, some environmental organisations have said without a greater commitment to ending support for fossil-fuels, this could be little more than a PR exercise. Most commitments made at COP will have to be self-policed. Only a few countries are making their pledges legally binding. COP26 was the moment countries revisited climate pledges made made under the 2015Paris Agreement. Six years ago, countries were asked to make changes to keep global warming ""well below"" 2C - and to try to aim for 1.5C. COP stands for ""Conference of the Parties"", and the one in Glasgow was the 26th annual summit. Ahead of it, 200 countries were asked for their plans to cut emissions by 2030. The goal is to keep cutting emissions until they reachnet zeroby mid-century. Next year's COP27 summit is in Egypt. Simple guide to climate change What will climate change look like for you?

"Foreign travel is now easier for people in the UK than at any time since the beginning of the pandemic. However, there are still regulations about who can enter most countries, restrictions on what you can do when you get there, and rules to follow when you return home. These can change quickly, so it's important to keep checking theForeign Office guidance,externaland tourist information for your destination before you go. Here are some key things to know about travelling to popular destinations. Everyone travelling to Spain (including children) must submit an onlineHealth Control Form(in English), no more than 48 hours before departure. This will generate a QR code which needs to be presented (either digitally or as a hard copy) at the Spanish border. All travellers aged 12 and over must be able to prove they've been fully vaccinated (with both doses of a two-dose vaccine or one dose of a one-dose vaccine) at least 14 days before arrival. Proof of a negative test or recovery from Covid is not accepted. From 23:00 GMT on 13 February children aged 12-17 do not need to be double-jabbed to enter the country. Instead, they must  present a negative PCR test taken no more than 72 hours before arrival. You must have received your final vaccine dose no earlier than 270 days (about nine months) before travelling. If it was earlier than this, you must be able to show proof of having received a booster jab. There is no requirement for 14 days to have passed between receiving your booster and entering Spain. Spain (like all EU countries) will accept as proof theNHS Covid Pass,Scotland's NHS Covid Status PassorNorthern Ireland's COVIDCert NI app- these can be presented either in digital form on a phone, or printed (as long as it's dated after 1 November 2021). Fully vaccinated children aged 12 to 15 can now also use the NHS app to show their Covid status, or they can request anNHS Covid Pass letter for international travel.Children under the age of 12 do not need to show proof of vaccination. If you have not been fully vaccinated, you can only enter Spain if your journey is classed as""essential""by the Spanish Ministry of Health. If your journey qualifies, you will need to present either a negative PCR test taken within the previous 72 hours, or a negative antigen test/LFT taken within the previous 24 hours, or else a medical certificate to say that you have recovered from Covid in the previous six months. If you're travelling via Gibraltar, check the latestForeign Office travel advice. Wherever you are in Spain, you must observe social distancing of 1.5m (5ft). Everyone aged six and over must also wear a face mask in the following places (unless they have a medical exemption): Some regions may have additional restrictive measures, including: You should check with local and regional authorities for more details. The Foreign Office has specifichealthcare guidance for UK nationals visiting Spain. For more details about travelling in Spain, go to theUK Foreign Office travel advice for Spain Everyone aged 12 and over travelling to the UK must fill in anonline passenger locator formbefore they depart. Adults can complete the form for under-18s travelling with them. If youqualify as fully vaccinated, you do not need to take any tests either before or after you arrive in the UK, nor is there any need to quarantine. The same rules apply for travellers under the age of 18. If you are 18 or over, and not fully vaccinated: You can enter France from the UK if you: Since 12 February you no longer need to present proof of a negative PCR or LFT/antigen test before you travel if you're fully vaccinated. France (like all EU countries) accepts as proof theNHS Covid Pass,Scotland's NHS Covid Status PassorNorthern Ireland's COVIDCert NI app- these can be presented either in digital form on a phone, or printed (as long as it's dated after 1 November 2021). If you are unvaccinated, you can only enter France for essential reasons(listed here - in French). You must also show: Since 12 February, you no longer need to self-isolate on arrival if you're not fully vaccinated. Children from the UK aged 12 years old or over who are not fully vaccinated will be treated as vaccinated if they are travelling with fully vaccinated adults. However, if a child aged 12 or over is unvaccinated and travelling alone or with unvaccinated adults, they will be subject to the same conditions as the adults, including the need to self-isolate. Children aged 11 years old or younger do not need to present a negative test result to travel to France, although a ""sworn statement"" must be completed for them. Face masks are required in all enclosed public spaces. You also need to wear a mask in some outdoor public spaces, such as queues, markets, or stadiums. Children under 11 are not required to wear masks. Everyone aged 16 and over now needs a""pass vaccinal""to attend large events and for entry to a wide range of venues including bars, restaurants, museums, or to use some types of public transport including planes and long-distance trains. To qualify for a pass vaccinal you must have: Children aged 12-15 still need a pass sanitaire to access many venues and events. To qualify for a pass sanitaire you must have either: You can get a pass sanitaire by presenting the QR code from your NHS Covid app if you come fromEngland or Wales,ScotlandorNorthern Irelandor by using a downloadable PDF certificate which is dated after 1 November 2021. You can also generate a pass sanitaire by scanning and saving the QR code from your NHS Covid Pass or equivalent, into FranceâsâTousAntiCovidâ app. For more details about travelling in France, go to theUK Foreign Office travel advice. Everyone aged 12 and over travelling to the UK must fill in anonline passenger locator formbefore they depart. Adults can complete the form for under-18s travelling with them.

If you are 18 or over, and not fully vaccinated: You can travel to Italy from the UK without having to self-isolate, as long as you can prove you were fully vaccinated, with the second dose less than 180 days (six months) ago. If your second vaccine dose was earlier than this, you must also show proof of a booster jab, or proof that you have recovered from Covid in the past 180 days. Italy (like all EU countries) accepts as proof theNHS Covid Pass,Scotland's NHS Covid Status PassorNorthern Ireland's COVIDCert NI app- these can be presented either in digital form on a phone, or printed (as long as it's dated after 1 November 2021).

The QR code from your NHS Covid Pass, NHS Covid Status Pass or Covidcert NI Pass will be accepted as a super green pass. You can also present a paper version, as long as it is dated after 1 November 2021. If you have had a booster, or have had the first two jabs AND recovered from Covid, there is no expiry date on your Super Green Pass. If, however, you have simply had your first two jabs, your pass will only be valid for 180 days after your second dose. If - for whatever reason - you are not eligible for a super green pass you will need aâgreen passâto access many public spaces. The pass is also required to travel on most public transport between regions. Thegreen passis a temporary pass, which lasts 48 hours. You can obtain one by testing negative with a rapid Covid test available from local pharmacies and test centres. The test provider will print the test results and email you a code. You will need these to accessthe government websitewhich will generate the temporary green pass. Under-18s in the UK who have only received one dose of vaccine are not considered fully vaccinated, and they also have to obtain a 48-hour green pass by means of a negative Covid test. You have to wear a face covering in all indoor public spaces, and outdoor spaces where social distancing is not possible. Children under the age of six do not need to wear a mask. Social distancing of 1m (3ft) must be observed, and large gatherings should be avoided.

If you are 18 or over, and not fully vaccinated: If you have been fully vaccinated: If you have not been fully vaccinated, you cannot travel to the US, although exceptions are granted, for instance for children under 18.The CDC has more details here.. If you qualify as an exception, you will need to: Children under the age of 18 who are not fully vaccinated do not have to self-isolate when they enter the US, but they must take a test 3-5 days after arrival. They should self-isolate if any symptoms develop or if they test positive. It is now possible to travel to every state in the US if you are fully vaccinated. Rules on social distancing and face coverings vary: check the relevantstate government websitebefore you arrive. Rules can also vary within individual states. You need to wear a mask on aeroplanes, trains, buses and at airports, train stations and bus stations wherever you are in the US.

If you are 18 or over, and not fully vaccinated: All travellers to Ireland (including children) must fill in an onlinepassenger locator formbefore departure. It will be checked by air or sea carriers and failure to complete it is an offence. Individuals travelling from Great Britain to Ireland via Northern Ireland should also complete a Passenger Locator Form. If you are fully vaccinated or can demonstrate you have recovered from Covid in the past year, you no longer need to take a pre-departure Covid test. If more than 270 days (9 months) have passed since your second dose, you will need to have had a booster to be considered fully vaccinated. Children aged 11 and under don't need to take a pre-departure test. Some adults are also exempt because of their occupation or if they are receiving medical treatment. More details can be found on theIrish government website. If you are not fully vaccinated, and have not recently recovered from Covid, you will need to show evidence of a negative PCR test result, taken within 72 hours prior to arrival into the country. Ireland (like all EU countries) accepts theNHS Covid Passas proof of vaccination and/or recovery from Covid, along withScotland's NHS Covid Status PassorNorthern Ireland's COVIDCert NI app. These can be presented either in digital form on a phone, or printed (as long as it's dated after 1 November 2021). If you are travelling to Ireland from Northern Ireland, you do not need to complete a passenger locator form, or provide any proof of vaccination, recovery status or negative tests as long as you have not visited any other countries in the last 14 days. For more details about travelling in Ireland go to theUK Foreign Office travel advice for Ireland Face coverings remain compulsory for over-13s in shops, banks and post offices, in taxis, in bus and rail stations, in cinemas and theatres and on public transport.

You may be asked to take a rapid Covid test on arrival in Greece, andquarantine in a hotel for at least five daysif positive. You may also have to self-isolate if other passengers on your flight or ferry test positive. The Greek government âstrongly recommendsâ that travellers take either a certified LFT/antigen or PCR test on days two and four after arrival. All restrictions remain under regular review. In areas where Covid case rates are particularly high and hospital capacity is limited, restrictions may be tighter or re-imposed with limited notice. Check the latest local guidance and follow the advice of local authorities. Everyone aged five or over must wear a mask in all indoor and outdoor public spaces, in all areas of Greece. In certain settings - such as in supermarkets and pharmacies, and on public transport - you must wear either double masks (at least one of which should be surgical), or an N95/FFP2 mask.

Steve HoldenMusic reporter, BBC Newsbeat One of Scotland's most famous music venues is preparing to open its doors for the first time in 18 months now that coronavirus restrictions are lifted. If you've ever been to King Tut's Wah Wah Hut you'll know its famous steps inside which have the names printed of all the massive artists who've played there over the years. Manager Nicola tells me lockdown has had a big impact on staff and customers at the 300-capacity venue. ""It's made a lot of us quite introverted almost, you start doubting yourself I think. Just to get everyone back in the one place we love so much and to just have that energy around us again is going to be so, so good,"" she says. Sound engineer Jordan says it's ""unbelievable to be back"" and John on the bar says ""there's no stone unturned in this venue to make sure it's safe for everyone coming in"". He says they're booked up with acts until 2024. Clubbers queued outside venues in Scotland and celebrated when they reopened at midnight We are going to be winding down our coronavirus updates soon so here's a recap on the day's news: Baroness Dido Harding will step down from her NHS role in October. The Tory peer became chairwoman of NHS Improvement in October 2017. Baroness Harding was also executive chairwoman of the Government's coronavirus Test and Trace programme until April this year. The scheme has come in for criticism over the course of the pandemic, with a report from the Commons Public Accounts Committee in March saying there was""no clear evidence""the Â£22bn venture contributed to a reduction in coronavirus infection levels. News of her departure from NHS Improvement was first reported by theHealth Service Journal.,external Read more:Dido Harding's meteoric rise from telecoms to test and trace, and beyond The UK's much-lauded vaccine programme has been hailed as a success and the way out of the pandemic. But how does it compare with others around the world? As you can see below, the UK remains ahead of other major nations and the EU in terms of vaccination doses delivered per 100 people. Obviously the figures here are above 100 for every hundred people as it adds together first and second doses. And it is based on entire populations, rather than just those aged over 19. But when you compare with other countries around the world the UK now has the 10th highest rate of vaccination doses per 100 people - with the UAE some way out in front. While these are impressive figures on the vaccination front, the Uk has faced another accusation that it is ""hoarding"" Covid vaccines. The Global Justice Now campaign group says the UK's unused doses of vaccine could cover the 10 least-vaccinated countries in the world, which includes Syria, Yemen and South Sudan. The group says low and middle income countries are left ""fighting for scraps"". The UK has ordered more than 500 million doses of seven of the most promising vaccines, including the four so far approved for use. There would be millions of doses to spare even if all over-16s were jabbed and third doses were given to high-risk groups, Global Justice Now says, citing data from life science analytics company Airfinity. Nick Dearden, director of the campaign group, says: ""It's an insult to the thousands dying each day from Covid-19."" China and India have administered the highest number of vaccine doses, with almost 1.8 billion and more than 500 million respectively. The US ranks third, with around 350 million. While countries in Europe and the Americas are progressing well with their vaccination campaigns,many states in Africa have experienced supply issues. Read more:How fast is progress around the world? The UK is now on the brink of having three-quarters of its adult population fully vaccinated against Covid. It looked possible that the landmark could have been reached in today's figures - but bear in mind that Sunday is the slowest day for vaccines - because fewer centres are open and fewer appointments are made. Instead, the total has ticked up to 74.8% - or 39,551,538 people if you are counting them individually. So if you have had the jab in your arm today, then you will probably find out this time tomorrow that you are a little part of history. The UK reached the 50% milestone on3 Juneand 25% of adults had received both jabs by27 April. The government has already announced that by the end of September, people in England will require full vaccination statusto go to nightclubs and some other events with large crowds- so ministers will be watching the second dose figure to see how close it edges to 100% in the weeks ahead. The updated figures also show that 37 people more died in the UK with coronavirus. This brings the total number of people to die within 28 days of a positive Covid-19 test to 130,357. Today's death toll is up on 24 on the same day a week ago and 14 two weeks ago, which is the clearest indication of how the figures are changing. But this was always expected as deaths tend to come about three weeks, on average, after infection and there was a surge in cases during July. There have been a further 25,161 new coronavirus infections recorded in the last 24 hours in the UK,according to government data.,external This is  slightly down from  Sunday but up from 21,952 last Monday. Today's figure includes the 852 new cases in Scotland, in the final  24-hour period before lockdown restrictions were lifted. As we heard earlier, analysis from the Office for National Statistics suggests vaccine hesitancy is falling, but is still high in London. The figures also suggest hesitancy among young people has fallen, but among black people is growing. Dr Nikki Kanani, deputy lead for the NHS vaccination programme, says she wants to thank NHS colleagues and volunteers for their work to increase confidence in the Covid jab among people of all age groups and ethnic minority backgrounds. ""The vaccine remains the single best defence against Covid and whether you have been eligible for some time, or are a newly eligible 16 or 17-year-old, I would urge you to come forward and take up the evergreen offer of a vaccine in order to protect yourself and your loved ones,"" she says. Most of Scotland's legal coronavirus restrictions ended today but some rules are staying for time being - like face coverings and the 1m social distancing rule in secondary schools for at least six weeks. Since May, secondary pupils in England have not needed to wear masks in classrooms or communal areas,although some schools have asked students to In Scotland, people will still have to wear face coverings in all the same indoor settings as in level zero, such as shops, hospitality venues and public transport. The rules say that face coverings can beremoved while dancing, drinking and dining, and drinking at the barwill be allowed in pubs. The 2m distancing rule will remainin healthcare settingssuch as hospitals, GP surgeries and dental surgeries.. The Scottish government is also continuing to advise people to work from home where it is an option for them. Again this is a different stance from England where a graduakl return of these people to the workplace over the summer has been advised.Here's our guide to the rule changes. Pupils across England are preparing to collect their A-level results and some of them may be wondering what awaits them if they choose to go to university. Three siblings from Swindon haveshared their experiencesof university life. For Danielle Herbert, 22, the pandemic meant a cancelled graduation, sitting alone while friends partied on the floor above and ""massive gaps"" in learning. Older sister Jess, 24, says the pandemic ""stripped away"" her independence and she found working online ""lonely and isolating"". But for their brother Ryan, 21, learning online during the pandemic gave him the ""ability to openly ask questions"" and ""learn in my own time"". Restaurateurs in Scotland are welcoming the lifting of limits on the number of diners as coronavirus restrictions are eased. There is now no limit on the number of people per table but masks must be worn when walking around a restaurant and customers are encouraged to continue using the Test and Protect app. Tammy Gilpin assistant manager of the Marlborough in Glasgow says: ""The lack of social distancing now inside is a really big thing in hospitality. ""It means, for us, we have now the capacity for 14 tables instead of eight. ""So obviously that's more people through the doors. It's really great news, it's a big step forwards."" It's a landmark moment in Scotland's coronavirus battle as all legal restrictions are ended. The pandemic is by no means over but what does the data tell us about how it has played out in Scotland? . CASES There have been355, 407confirmed cases of Covid-19 since the start of the pandemic. That incluides the852new cases confirmed on Sunday, HOSPITALISATIONS At the peak of the outbreak in spring 2020 there were more than1,500Covid patients in hospital, including over200in intensive care wards. Numbers reduced over the summer, but started to rise steadily again in September. In January 2021, the number of Covid patients in hospital passed the spring 2020 peak of1,520. There were40people in intensive care and360people in hospital with recently confirmed Covid-19 on Friday,according to the latest data.,external DEATHS The first coronavirus deathwas reported by NHS Lothian on 13 March 2020. Since then,7,992people have died following a positive test according to Scottish government data to 6 August. No further deaths were added to the total for Saturday or Sunday - but it should be noted that most register offices remain closed over the weekend. You can read our full analysis of key coronavirus figures in Scotlandhere. Scotland has recorded 852 new Covid cases and no deaths in the past 24 hours, Scottish government figures show. It is the last 24-hour period before the lifting of most coronavirus restrictions asthe country moved beyond level 0 at midnight. The daily test positivity rate is 6.7%, up from 6.0% the previous day, and 356 people were in hospital on Sunday, down by four on the day before. We'll bring you UK-wide Covid figures in about 80 minutes when they are published by the government. A florist in Glasgow's West End says she's delighted that business is getting back to normal as Scotland's coronavirus restrictions are lifted. Brenda Hodgkins says she's happy that she and her customers will still need to wear a mask inside her shop, Petals Flowers. She says: ""I want to stay open. It's great getting back to the way things were, getting a wee bit back to normality again. ""I don't think the masks are going anywhere soon, I think we are going to be having them on for a long, long time and if that's what we have to do, that's what we have to do."" Randox, one of the largest suppliers of Covid test kits, says it will increase the number of drop boxes and frequency of collections after images of overflowing boxes were shared online. The company provides PCR tests which are required for people returning to the UK from green and amber list countries. Travellers must pay for their own tests and the system has been criticised with some in the travel industry saying it is pricing people out of choosing foreign holidays this summer.

The nurse who vaccinated Scotland's First Minister is urging young people not to have vaccination parties. Elaine Anderson, 51, was thrust into the limelight when she gave Nicola Sturgeon her first Covid-19 jab in April. Anderson, who is from Clydebank in West Dunbartonshire, usually works as a vaccinator in schools. She says: ""Now we are vaccinating the young people, which is fabulous. ""Many just say 'Please get it into me' - they just want go get back to normality."" ""Nothing makes me happier than looking out the window and seeing people in their droves, lining up to get their vaccination. ""There's such excitement - I get a real buzz. ""My parting line to them is 'Please don't have a vaccination party!""' Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon she says her message to people is to ""enjoy the return of many freedoms but be careful"". As most legal coronavirus restrictions were lifted in Scotland, Sturgeon urged people to wear face coverings where appropriate, wash their hands regularly and keep rooms ventilated. She says even though it is no longer a legal requirement not to mix indoors with other households it still makes sense to keep a safe distance. She says: ""If we are careful and cautious as we lift these restrictions hopefully we will continue to keep the virus under control."" She says her most overwhelming and important message is to get vaccinated - particularly those in the younger age groups. Â© 2025 BBC.

"The waterfall at Ao Yon is popular with tourists Thai police have charged a 27-year-old man in connection with the death of a Swiss woman who was found near a waterfall on the resort island of Phuket last week. Local officials identified the victim as Nicole Sauvain-Weisskopf, aged 57. Police found her face down in the water covered by a black sheet, with her phone, shorts and trainers nearby. Theerawut Tortip told reporters at a police press conference that he killed the woman and stole from her. ""I would like to apologise to the family of the tourist and plead for all Thais to forgive me,"" he said. He was detained after nearby CCTV footage showed him travelling to the waterfall around the same time Ms Sauvain-Weisskopf went there, police said. The waterfall at Ao Yon is not far from the coast and a popular tourist spot in Phuket's Wichit area. Her death came just weeks afterThailand launched its so-called ""Phuket Sandbox"" scheme. She reportedly arrived in Thailand on 13 July. Under the programme, vaccinated tourists can come to the island without the need to quarantine, but cannot travel to the mainland within 14 days. Ms Sauvain-Weisskopf's death has prompted local officials to step up security on the island amid concerns that it is a huge setback to the sandbox scheme. Governor Narong Woonciew said officials would survey unsafe areas in each community and put them under surveillance. A spokesman for Thailand's foreign minister Don Pramudwinai said on Twitter he had sent his condolences to the Swiss ambassador for the ""murder of a Swiss woman in Phuket"". And government spokesman Anucha Burapachaisri said that Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha had ordered police ""to expedite the investigation to identify and arrest the culprit"". He also ordered officials to increase security in Phuket. Switzerland's foreign ministry meanwhile released a statement on Thursday saying Thai authorities had contacted them about the death of an ""apparent Swiss citizen"" but gave no more details, citing privacy concerns.

"Chinese technology giant Alibaba will sack a manager accused of rape, according to a memo seen by the BBC. In the letter sent to employees of the firm, chief executive Daniel Zhang said two other bosses who failed to act on the allegation have resigned. Alibaba is working with police after a female worker said her male colleague raped her in a hotel room while she was unconscious after a ""drunken night"". Her allegations have been widely shared on Chinese social media. Mr Zhang said the manager accused of rape had admitted that ""there were intimate acts"" while the woman was ""inebriated"". The letter went on to say: ""He will be fired and never be rehired. Whether he has committed rape or indecency that violates the law will be determined by law enforcement."" The memo also highlighted that Alibaba would take responsibility for the woman's wellbeing, saying: ""We will do everything we can to take care of her."" On Sunday, police in the eastern city of Jinan, where the incident took place, said they are investigating the allegations. The woman's account of the incident, which was published in an eleven-page document, has prompted a social media storm on China's Twitter-like platform, Weibo. The woman alleged that the manager coerced her into travelling to the city of Jinan, which is around 900km (560 miles) from Alibaba's head office in Hangzhou, for a meeting with a client. She has accused her superiors of ordering her to drink alcohol with co-workers during dinner. She said that on the evening of 27 July the client kissed her. She then recalls waking up in her hotel room the next day without her clothes on and with no memory of the night before. The woman said she obtained surveillance camera footage that showed the manager had gone into her room four times during the evening. Alibaba said it is ""staunchly opposed to forced drinking culture"" in its memo to employees. After returning to Hangzhou, the woman said the incident was reported to Alibaba's human resources (HR) department and senior management and that she had requested the manager be fired. She said that human resources initially agreed to the request but took no further action. In reference to this, the memo to employees said: ""In the entire incident handling process, the HR function did not pay enough attention and care to our people."" ""They were rational but lacked empathy and care. At the same time, an emergency response system was absent, and a severe misjudgement was made,"" it added.

The scheme has come in for criticism over the course of the pandemic, with a report from the Commons Public Accounts Committee in March saying there was""no clear evidence""the Â£22bn venture contributed to a reduction in coronavirus infection levels. News of her departure from NHS Improvement was first reported by theHealth Service Journal.,external Read more:Dido Harding's meteoric rise from telecoms to test and trace, and beyond The UK's much-lauded vaccine programme has been hailed as a success and the way out of the pandemic. But how does it compare with others around the world? As you can see below, the UK remains ahead of other major nations and the EU in terms of vaccination doses delivered per 100 people. Obviously the figures here are above 100 for every hundred people as it adds together first and second doses. And it is based on entire populations, rather than just those aged over 19. But when you compare with other countries around the world the UK now has the 10th highest rate of vaccination doses per 100 people - with the UAE some way out in front. While these are impressive figures on the vaccination front, the Uk has faced another accusation that it is ""hoarding"" Covid vaccines. The Global Justice Now campaign group says the UK's unused doses of vaccine could cover the 10 least-vaccinated countries in the world, which includes Syria, Yemen and South Sudan. The group says low and middle income countries are left ""fighting for scraps"". The UK has ordered more than 500 million doses of seven of the most promising vaccines, including the four so far approved for use. There would be millions of doses to spare even if all over-16s were jabbed and third doses were given to high-risk groups, Global Justice Now says, citing data from life science analytics company Airfinity. Nick Dearden, director of the campaign group, says: ""It's an insult to the thousands dying each day from Covid-19."" China and India have administered the highest number of vaccine doses, with almost 1.8 billion and more than 500 million respectively. The US ranks third, with around 350 million. While countries in Europe and the Americas are progressing well with their vaccination campaigns,many states in Africa have experienced supply issues. Read more:How fast is progress around the world? The UK is now on the brink of having three-quarters of its adult population fully vaccinated against Covid. It looked possible that the landmark could have been reached in today's figures - but bear in mind that Sunday is the slowest day for vaccines - because fewer centres are open and fewer appointments are made. Instead, the total has ticked up to 74.8% - or 39,551,538 people if you are counting them individually. So if you have had the jab in your arm today, then you will probably find out this time tomorrow that you are a little part of history. The UK reached the 50% milestone on3 Juneand 25% of adults had received both jabs by27 April. The government has already announced that by the end of September, people in England will require full vaccination statusto go to nightclubs and some other events with large crowds- so ministers will be watching the second dose figure to see how close it edges to 100% in the weeks ahead. The updated figures also show that 37 people more died in the UK with coronavirus. This brings the total number of people to die within 28 days of a positive Covid-19 test to 130,357. Today's death toll is up on 24 on the same day a week ago and 14 two weeks ago, which is the clearest indication of how the figures are changing. But this was always expected as deaths tend to come about three weeks, on average, after infection and there was a surge in cases during July. There have been a further 25,161 new coronavirus infections recorded in the last 24 hours in the UK,according to government data.,external This is  slightly down from  Sunday but up from 21,952 last Monday. Today's figure includes the 852 new cases in Scotland, in the final  24-hour period before lockdown restrictions were lifted. As we heard earlier, analysis from the Office for National Statistics suggests vaccine hesitancy is falling, but is still high in London. The figures also suggest hesitancy among young people has fallen, but among black people is growing. Dr Nikki Kanani, deputy lead for the NHS vaccination programme, says she wants to thank NHS colleagues and volunteers for their work to increase confidence in the Covid jab among people of all age groups and ethnic minority backgrounds. ""The vaccine remains the single best defence against Covid and whether you have been eligible for some time, or are a newly eligible 16 or 17-year-old, I would urge you to come forward and take up the evergreen offer of a vaccine in order to protect yourself and your loved ones,"" she says. Most of Scotland's legal coronavirus restrictions ended today but some rules are staying for time being - like face coverings and the 1m social distancing rule in secondary schools for at least six weeks. Since May, secondary pupils in England have not needed to wear masks in classrooms or communal areas,although some schools have asked students to In Scotland, people will still have to wear face coverings in all the same indoor settings as in level zero, such as shops, hospitality venues and public transport. The rules say that face coverings can beremoved while dancing, drinking and dining, and drinking at the barwill be allowed in pubs. The 2m distancing rule will remainin healthcare settingssuch as hospitals, GP surgeries and dental surgeries.. The Scottish government is also continuing to advise people to work from home where it is an option for them. Again this is a different stance from England where a graduakl return of these people to the workplace over the summer has been advised.Here's our guide to the rule changes. Pupils across England are preparing to collect their A-level results and some of them may be wondering what awaits them if they choose to go to university. Three siblings from Swindon haveshared their experiencesof university life. For Danielle Herbert, 22, the pandemic meant a cancelled graduation, sitting alone while friends partied on the floor above and ""massive gaps"" in learning. Older sister Jess, 24, says the pandemic ""stripped away"" her independence and she found working online ""lonely and isolating"". But for their brother Ryan, 21, learning online during the pandemic gave him the ""ability to openly ask questions"" and ""learn in my own time"". Restaurateurs in Scotland are welcoming the lifting of limits on the number of diners as coronavirus restrictions are eased. There is now no limit on the number of people per table but masks must be worn when walking around a restaurant and customers are encouraged to continue using the Test and Protect app. Tammy Gilpin assistant manager of the Marlborough in Glasgow says: ""The lack of social distancing now inside is a really big thing in hospitality. ""It means, for us, we have now the capacity for 14 tables instead of eight. ""So obviously that's more people through the doors. It's really great news, it's a big step forwards."" It's a landmark moment in Scotland's coronavirus battle as all legal restrictions are ended. The pandemic is by no means over but what does the data tell us about how it has played out in Scotland? . CASES There have been355, 407confirmed cases of Covid-19 since the start of the pandemic. That incluides the852new cases confirmed on Sunday, HOSPITALISATIONS At the peak of the outbreak in spring 2020 there were more than1,500Covid patients in hospital, including over200in intensive care wards. Numbers reduced over the summer, but started to rise steadily again in September. In January 2021, the number of Covid patients in hospital passed the spring 2020 peak of1,520. There were40people in intensive care and360people in hospital with recently confirmed Covid-19 on Friday,according to the latest data.,external DEATHS The first coronavirus deathwas reported by NHS Lothian on 13 March 2020. Since then,7,992people have died following a positive test according to Scottish government data to 6 August. No further deaths were added to the total for Saturday or Sunday - but it should be noted that most register offices remain closed over the weekend. You can read our full analysis of key coronavirus figures in Scotlandhere. Scotland has recorded 852 new Covid cases and no deaths in the past 24 hours, Scottish government figures show. It is the last 24-hour period before the lifting of most coronavirus restrictions asthe country moved beyond level 0 at midnight. The daily test positivity rate is 6.7%, up from 6.0% the previous day, and 356 people were in hospital on Sunday, down by four on the day before. We'll bring you UK-wide Covid figures in about 80 minutes when they are published by the government. A florist in Glasgow's West End says she's delighted that business is getting back to normal as Scotland's coronavirus restrictions are lifted. Brenda Hodgkins says she's happy that she and her customers will still need to wear a mask inside her shop, Petals Flowers. She says: ""I want to stay open. It's great getting back to the way things were, getting a wee bit back to normality again. ""I don't think the masks are going anywhere soon, I think we are going to be having them on for a long, long time and if that's what we have to do, that's what we have to do."" Randox, one of the largest suppliers of Covid test kits, says it will increase the number of drop boxes and frequency of collections after images of overflowing boxes were shared online. The company provides PCR tests which are required for people returning to the UK from green and amber list countries. Travellers must pay for their own tests and the system has been criticised with some in the travel industry saying it is pricing people out of choosing foreign holidays this summer.

In a statement Randox says: ""Randox is providing premium testing services in dynamic and rapidly changing circumstances and is committed to continuously improving its logistics network, to ensure that international travellers receive their results in time."" As we've been telling you during our coverage today, most legal Covid rules in Scotland have been lifted. But what's the situation in the rest of the UK? InWales, the measures were eased further on Saturday. This means:  But a few restrictions remain, including the call to work from home wherever possible. InEngland, measures were eased on 19 July. The changes include:  InNorthern Ireland, some things have changed including:  For more detail on what the rules are in the UK's different nations,you can read our explainer here. The nurse who vaccinated Scotland's First Minister is urging young people not to have vaccination parties. Elaine Anderson, 51, was thrust into the limelight when she gave Nicola Sturgeon her first Covid-19 jab in April. Anderson, who is from Clydebank in West Dunbartonshire, usually works as a vaccinator in schools. She says: ""Now we are vaccinating the young people, which is fabulous. ""Many just say 'Please get it into me' - they just want go get back to normality."" ""Nothing makes me happier than looking out the window and seeing people in their droves, lining up to get their vaccination. ""There's such excitement - I get a real buzz. ""My parting line to them is 'Please don't have a vaccination party!""' Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon she says her message to people is to ""enjoy the return of many freedoms but be careful"". As most legal coronavirus restrictions were lifted in Scotland, Sturgeon urged people to wear face coverings where appropriate, wash their hands regularly and keep rooms ventilated. She says even though it is no longer a legal requirement not to mix indoors with other households it still makes sense to keep a safe distance. She says: ""If we are careful and cautious as we lift these restrictions hopefully we will continue to keep the virus under control."" She says her most overwhelming and important message is to get vaccinated - particularly those in the younger age groups. Â© 2025 BBC.

"The world's largest ever report into climate change is published, setting out the stark reality of the state of the planet The study, by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, says it is ""unequivocal"" that human activity is responsible for global warming Some changes, like sea-level rises, are irreversible, the study finds But there is new hope that deep cuts in emissions of greenhouse gases could stabilise rising temperatures It is the most up-to-date assessment of how global warming will change the world in the coming decades, and looked at more than 14,000 scientific papers Environmental experts have said it is a ""massive wake-up call"" to governments to cut emissions In recent years, the world has seen record-breaking temperatures, raging wildfires and devastating flooding Edited by Hugo Bachega We're ending our live updates following the release of the landmark UN report on climate change. Thank you for joining us. Here are the key points:  You can find out more about the report here. Today's updates were brought to you by Ashitha Nagesh, David Walker and Toby Luckhurst. The editors were Hugo Bachega and Robert Greenall. There's been a lot to digest from the climate report, and you may be asking yourself: What can I do? Our colleague Chris Morris from the BBC Reality Check team explains how changing three aspects of your lifestyle can make a difference. This video can not be played US Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm: The planet is on fire, and our hair should be on fire about this! We need to move faster to deploy, deploy, deploy clean energy and make our communities more resilient.  Mohamed Nasheed, former Maldives president and ambassador for the climate vulnerable forum
of 48 countries: We're paying with our lives for the carbon someone else emitted. We'll take measures soon to begin to address this injustice, which we cannot merely accept.  Diann Black-Layne, ambassador of Antigua and Barbuda, lead
climate negotiator for the Alliance of Small Island States: If we keep warming to 1.5C, we're still facing 0.5m of sea level rise. But if we stop warming from reaching 2C, we can avoid a long-term three metres of sea level rise. That is our very future, right there.  Nick GarnettBBC News Darren Parkinsonis a Green Party councillor in Shipley in West
Yorkshire and is involved in the environmental campaign group, Clean Air
Bradford. ""What we do as individuals can make a real difference,"" he says. He's had a heat pump installed at the front of his house and has had his home fully insulated. He's also had solar panels on his roof for the last eight years, and says his home is now zero-carbon. ""People should make whatever effort they can. We've put in a heat pump, but everything helps and people should hold the government to account and make it fulfil its commitments on climate change."" He adds that while he knows the changes he's made are ""difficult and expensive"" for most people, the government should help with grants. AndDave Stevensthinks politicians are shifting the blame by saying people can tackle climate change by changing their own behaviour. ""They ask us to cycle more as if it's going to have a real impact, but, in the same breath, they're announcing billions of pounds to be spent on new road building schemes,"" he says, adding that there should be more tax incentives to encourage change. ""Of course there should be more bike paths, more low carbon electricity, more Low Traffic Neighbourhoods - and not everyone will like everything, we'll all dislike something, but we've got to move ten times faster than we have been doing."" Extreme heat, rainfall and other severe weather events are already more frequent and intense as a result of climate change, and the IPCC warns that as the planet continues to warm, this will only get worse. Here are pictures of some of the extreme weather we've seen in recent months. Wildfires on Evia island in Greece, August: Firefighters are attempting to put out the flames raging on the Greek island this week The North American heatwave, July: The heatwave left huge areas of California bone-dry and prone to wildfires A cooling centre was set up at the Oregon Convention Center in Portland to help people affected by the heatwave Flooding in western Europe, July: The Rhine river flooded the German city of Cologne The Belgian city of LiÃ¨ge was also hit by heavy flooding Flooding in Henan province in China, July: More than 300 people were killed in the flooding in Henan province The IPCC report might seem overwhelming, but there are still things we can do to tackle climate change. Environment correspondent Matt McGrath and Science correspondent Victoria Gill have been discussing their favourite solutions - from carbon taxes to vintage shopping. You can hear more about tackling climate change with Liz Bonnin, on theWhat Planet Are We On Podcast, available now on BBC Sounds. This video can not be played Matt McGrathEnvironment correspondent A recent study shows thatthe percentage of the global population at risk from flooding has risen by almost a quartersince the year 2000. Satellite images were used to document the rise, which is far greater than had been predicted by computer models.

The analysis shows that migration and a growing number of flood events are behind the rapid increase. By 2030, millions more will experience increased flooding due to climate and demographic change, according to the authors of the study, released before today's IPCC report. Flooding is the environmental disaster that impacts more people than any other, say researchers. That view has echoed around the world in recent weeks, with huge inundations destroying lives and property. In this new study, researchers looked at daily satellite imagery to estimate both the extent of flooding and the number of people exposed to over 900 large flood events between 2000 and 2018. They found that between 255 and 290 million people were directly affected - and between 2000 and 2015, the number of people living in these flooded locations increased by 58-86 million. This represents an increase of 20-24% in the proportion of the world population exposed to floods, some 10 times higher than previous estimates. The report warns that both extreme heat and extreme rainfall will become a lot more frequent and intense as global temperatures continue to rise. Both are already worse than pre-industrial levels, as the graphics below show. Satellite images show wildfires on the Greek island of Evia The IPCC's report was published this morning and is already making a huge impact, with world leaders and climate scientists across the globe calling for urgent action. So what have we learned? BBC environment correspondent Matt McGrath has summed up some of the biggest takeaways from the report - andyou can read them in detail here.  Climate campaignerGreta Thunberg has condemned the fashion industryover its ""huge"" contribution to climate change. The Swedish activist told Vogue Scandinavia that fashion brands needed to take responsibility for the environmental impact of their products. She highlighted ""fast fashion that many treat as disposables"". In a separate interview, Thunberg said she now plans to attend the UN climate conference due to be held in Glasgow this November.She had previously said she would skip COP26because she was concerned that the pandemic would leave some countries unable to attend. ""I've said before that I wasn't going to go if it wasn't fair,"" she told Reuters. ""But now they say that they will vaccinate all the delegates that are going
there. If that's considered fair and safe, then I will hopefully
attend."" You've been getting in touch with us with your thoughts on the IPCC report, and to tell us how you incorporate green habits into your lives. Keval Shah, London: My wife and I went vegan 11 years ago. The easiest, fastest and most convenient way to mitigate global warming is for the population to do the same. We need to get policymakers to make the connection now, as an urgent matter, and shift subsidies away from animal agriculture and towards a plant-based food system. Nothing else will work in time to save the planet.  Anne-Marie Moore, Scotland: I grow a variety of plants to attract insects and small animal life. Don't use plastic where unnecessary. Don't drive anymore. Recycling all waste where possible. Monitoring energy use at home. Becoming more aware of issues and behaviours that cause issues so I can educate my family on how to be eco friendly.  Lionel Tay, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia: I educate my six-year-old son on climate change, and how to cut down waste and recycle as much as possible. I share with him the recent BBC news on the wildfires in US, Turkey and Greece, as well as floods in China, Germany, Belgium and India. This Covid-19 lockdown was perfect timing for us to show him how we can cut down usage of water, electricity and other resources at home.  Brylie Christopher Oxley, Finland: Living with my son in a 50sqm apartment and without owning a private car. We're also primarily vegetarian, although we eat fish and some dairy (also oat milk substitute). Setting these kinds of constraints encourages more sustainable choices by default.  Esther McVey is one Conservative worried about the costs of changes designed to reduce carbon emissions A small group of Conservative MPs in the UK have saidthey fear the costs of tackling climate change will harm poor families. Former cabinet minister Esther McVey is one of the Tory MPs worried about the cost of changing boilers and insulating homes. ""What I would never want to do is bankrupt the country,"" she said. ""We don't go green and go red as a country at the same time."" But many others in the UK's ruling party have backed the government's net zero carbon target. Sam Hall, director of the Conservative Environment Network, which says it has the support of 105 Tory MPs, said the UK has a ""huge opportunity"" to lead the world. Environment Minister Zac Goldsmith has called the IPCC report ""appalling reading"". David BrownBBC News We've heard stark warnings this morning about the need to limit greenhouse gas emissions - and most of those warnings have been directed at governments. ButChina's carbon emissions are vast and growing, dwarfing those of other countries. Experts agree that without big reductions in China's emissions, the world cannot win the fight against climate change. President Xi Jinping has said his country will aim for its emissions to reach their highest point before 2030 and for carbon neutrality to be achieved by 2060 - but he has not said how China will achieve this extremely ambitious goal. While all countries face problems getting their emissions down, China is facing the biggest challenge. China's per-person emissions are about half those of the US, but its huge 1.4 billion population and explosive economic growth have pushed it way ahead of any other country in its overall emissions. China became the world's largest emitter of carbon dioxide in 2006 and is now responsible for more than a quarter of the world's overall greenhouse gas emissions. The country has some big advantages, particularly its capacity to stick to long-term strategies and mobilise large-scale investments. The Chinese authorities are facing a colossal task. What happens next could hardly be more important. The president of COP26 - the global climate summit in Glasgow this November - says we need ""far more in terms of action"" to control rising global temperatures. Alok Sharma said the G20 group of nations was ""absolutely key"" to meeting targets, as they produced 80% of global emissions. This video can not be played We've heard stark warnings about the rise in global temperature today. But what does that actually look like? Reality Check UK Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng
said this morning that cutting emissions does not necessarily need to mean the
economy shrinking. âIf
you look at the figures since 1990, weâve managed to reduce carbon emissions by
45% while growing the economy by 80% in that time,â he claimed. Total emissions did fall 45%,externalbetween 1990 and 2019 in the UK. Coronavirus restrictions also led to a big reduction in
the amount coming from the transport sector (that contributed to a 49% fall
between 1990 and 2020). Between 1990 and 2019,the economy grew by 78%,external. Again there was a subsequent Covid affect, with some of that
growth lost due to lockdowns (if you factor that in then the economy grew by
60% between 1990 and 2020). So the claim is supported by the
2019 figures, but those are now somewhat out of date. This video can not be played Greece wildfires: 'It's like a horror movie but it's real life' Today's report makes it clear that the effects of climate change caused by human activity can already be seen around the world in extreme heatwaves, heavy rainfall, droughts and tropical cyclones. It comes as Greece experiences its most severe heatwave in 30 years, with devastating wildfires on the island of Evia. If you are just joining us, here is a round-up of today's main events: Jonathan AmosScience correspondent We need to talk about that
scary dotted line in the IPCC's sea-level projections - the one that says a
global ocean rise approaching two metres by the end of the century can't be ruled out. This outcome is considered a low probability but it would have major impact if it happened. The line has been included because there are processes that can affect the melting and break-up of ice sheets which scientists still donât yet fully understand. One of these is something called Marine Ice Cliff Instability, or MICI (pron: Mickey). This is a scenario in which ice sheets could crumble away very quickly if the retreating edges of, say, Antarctica exposed extremely tall cliffs of ice. We know from the physics of ice that such structures cannot support their own weight and will slump. The question is: how likely is MICI to take hold in Antarctica and how fast could it progress? Right now, scientists can't answer this. They see some evidence for the process having occurred in the Earth's history; and think if it did happen, it's a possibility only under the most pessimistic warming futures. Dr Rob Larter, a marine geophysicist with the British Antarctic Survey, commented: ""With the present state of knowledge I agree with the description of runaway MICI as a low probability. However, I think it would be negligent to ignore it."" One final word. Don't lose sight of the sea-level rises that this report considers very likely. Remember, every additional centimetre increase in the height of the oceans puts more people at risk of coastal flooding. Valerie Masson-Delmotte, co-chair of the working group behind the IPCC report: Many of the changes set in motion by human-caused climate change are slow processes. These long lasting changes for the most part affect the planet's frozen regions and the oceans. Changes in ice sheets, deep ocean temperature and acidification will continue for centuries to thousands of years, meaning that they are irreversible in our lifetime and will continue for generations to come. The good news is that these irreversible changes can be slowed down with rapid, strong and sustained reductions in emissions.  Hoesung Lee, chairman of the IPCC: It is indisputable that human activities are causing climate change and making extreme weather events more frequent and severe. [The report] shows that climate change is affecting every region on our planet. It explains that strong, rapid, sustained reduction in carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions will be required to limit global warming.  Petteri Taalas, secretary-general of the World Meteorological Organization: Have we lost hope? No and yes. According to this report we still have a chance to stop the negative climate trend by the middle of this century by especially limiting the use of fossil fuels and by stopping deforestation... The report underlines the urgency to enhance the ambition level of climate mitigation.  Â© 2025 BBC.

"A new global agreement - the Glasgow Climate Pact - was reached at the COP26 summit. It aims to reduce the worst impacts of climate change - but some leaders and campaigners say it does not go far enough. The agreement - although not legally binding - will set the global agenda on climate change for the next decade: Emissions It was agreed countries will meet next year to pledge further cuts to emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) - agreenhouse gas which causes climate change. This is to try to keep temperature rises within 1.5C - which scientists say is required to prevent a ""climate catastrophe"". Current pledges, if met, will only limit global warming to about 2.4C. Coal For the first time at a COP conference, there was an explicit plan to reduce use of coal - which is responsible for 40% of annual CO2 emissions. However, countries only agreed a weaker commitment to ""phase down"" rather than ""phase out"" coal after a late intervention by China and India. PM: Climate deal sounds death knell for coal power Evasive words and coal compromise, but deal shows progress Developing countries The agreement pledged to significantly increase money to help poor countries cope with the effects of climate change and make the switch to clean energy. There's also the prospect of a trillion dollar a year fund from 2025 - after a previous pledge for richer countries to provide $100bn (Â£72bn) a year by 2020 was missed. While some observers say the COP26 agreement represented the ""start of a breakthrough"", some African and Latin American countries felt not enough progress was made. Why hasn't climate pledge to poor countries been met? Fossil fuel subsidies World leaders agreed to phase-out subsidies that artificially lower the price of coal, oil, or natural gas. However, no firm dates have been set. How much is still spent supporting oil, coal and gas? A flurry of other announcements were made: The world's biggest CO2 emitters, the US and China,pledged to cooperate more over the next decadein areas including methane emissions and the switch to clean energy. China has previously been reluctant to tackle domestic coal emissions - so this was seen as recognising the need for urgent action. Cautious welcome for US-China climate agreement Why China's climate policy matters to us all Leaders from more than 100 countries - with about 85% of the world's forests -promised to stop deforestationby 2030. This is seen as vital, as trees absorb vast amounts of CO2. Similar initiativeshaven't stopped deforestation, but this one's better funded. However, it's unclear how the pledge will be policed. Ascheme to cut 30% of methane emissions by 2030was agreed by more than 100 countries. Methane is currently responsible for a third of human-generated warming. The big emitters China, Russia and India haven't joined - but it's hoped they will later. Financial organisations controlling $130tnagreed to back ""clean"" technology, such as renewable energy, and direct finance away from fossil fuel-burning industries. The initiative is an attempt to involve private companies in meeting net zero targets. However, some environmental organisations have said without a greater commitment to ending support for fossil-fuels, this could be little more than a PR exercise. Most commitments made at COP will have to be self-policed. Only a few countries are making their pledges legally binding. COP26 was the moment countries revisited climate pledges made made under the 2015Paris Agreement. Six years ago, countries were asked to make changes to keep global warming ""well below"" 2C - and to try to aim for 1.5C. COP stands for ""Conference of the Parties"", and the one in Glasgow was the 26th annual summit. Ahead of it, 200 countries were asked for their plans to cut emissions by 2030. The goal is to keep cutting emissions until they reachnet zeroby mid-century. Next year's COP27 summit is in Egypt. Simple guide to climate change What will climate change look like for you?

"It was all smiles in Paris in 2015 but have countries fulfilled their climate promises? Agreed by 196 parties in the French capital in December 2015, the Paris climate deal aims to keep the rise in global temperatures this century ""well below 2C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5C."" We look at five key countries and how well they have kept their promises. Every one of the signatories to the Paris climate agreement has had to lodge a climate action plan with the UN to spell out what steps they are taking to curb carbon. Overall, according to a new assessment from global consultancy Systemiq, low-carbon solutions have been more successful in this period than many people realise. The growth in coal for energy outside of China has declined significantly. ""We have to translate what we can do into what we will do,"" said Lord Nicholas Stern, from the London School of Economics (LSE). ""But a big part of that is understanding what is happening and that's why I think this report is important. It will change people's perspectives of what is possible and translate that into action."" So the big picture might be improving, but what about individual nations? We looked at how five key countries have lived up to their promises under the pact. As well as being the world's fifth largest economy, the UK is the incoming president of the Conference of the Parties or COP, the main UN climate negotiating forum, which will take place in Glasgow in November 2021. This global gathering of world leaders will try and work out how to improve the collective effort to tackle climate change, and take the next steps.  COP26 in Glasgow will be the most important meeting since the Paris climate agreement was signed five years ago. The president of the meeting is a key influence on the success or failure of the event. Expanding offshore wind energy is a key policy for the UK's future climate targets In Paris in 2015, French foreign minister Laurent Fabius was seen as ahugely effective, impartial leaderwho gained the trust of nations rich and poor. UK Business Secretary Alok Sharma has already been tasked with the job by Boris Johnson, but alreadythere are worries that he has too much on his plate. Has the UK lived up to its promises? The answer to this is mostly yes. Since 2008, the UK government has had to set five-year greenhouse gas targets by law, based on advice from the independent Climate Change Committee (CCC). Targets set under the first three carbon budgets have been met. While it was part of the EU, the UK's target for 2020 was a reduction of 16% on 2005 emissions. The UK easily achieved this. In fact, right now, Britain's total output of warming gases has gone down by around 45% from 1990 levels. As a result of leaving the EU, the UK has to register its own standalone plan to cut carbon with the UN. This is known as a ""nationally determined contribution"" or NDC. It focuses on targets for 2030, which are meant to show the pathway to net zero emissions by 2050. Reaching net zero requires that any carbon emissions are balanced by absorbing an equivalent amount from the atmosphere by, for example, planting trees. Thenew 2030 plan, released on 3 December, won plaudits for its ambition. But critics said there were major hurdles ahead. Under the NDC, around 87% of UK electricity would need to come from low carbon sources by the end of this decade, up from over 50% now. Almost half the cars on the road would need to be electric, up from around 6% at present. As well as making major changes to transport, energy and food emissions, the UK will have to take a tough stand internationally so that it doesn't simply substitute carbon cuts at home with emissions-laden products from abroad. ""It's what you do at home, but it's also what you invest in internationally,"" Dr Alison Doig, from theEnergy and Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU),external, told BBC News. ""The UK needs to ensure with our export finance credits and with our Brexit deals, that we are strongly signalling overseas, what we're doing domestically."" Nevertheless, in April 2021, the government announced that it would speed up its emissions-cutting plan. Boris Johnson said carbon releases would be reduced by 78% by 2035 - taking the country more than three quarters of the way to net zero. Australia matters because not only is it one of the biggest sources of fossil fuels, it is also a country highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. The nation is now the world's largest exporter of coal and gas, according to arecent study,external. Wildfires in Australia were made worse by long running drought Emissions of greenhouse gases from Australian exports are responsible for 3.6% of global emissionsaccording to research,external. On a per capita basis, and including exports, Australians are responsible for four times as much CO2 as people living in the US. Politically, Australia is also very important in climate change terms as well. Over the past five years, it has moved further away from the majority of nations in the UN, which have been urging rapid cuts in carbon. Prime minister Scott Morrison wascriticised by other politiciansfor downplaying the role of climate change after recent, devastating wildfires. Has Australia lived up to its promises? Not really. While it is set to hit a rather low 2020 target set under a previous global agreement, its actions under the Paris climate agreement are not measuring up, according to experts. Australia's Prime Minister Scott Morrison has been criticised for not not taking climate change seriously Australia set a target for 2030 of making a 26-28% reduction in its emissions compared with 2005 levels. Projections published at the end of 2019 suggested Australian emissions will be only 16% lower than 2005 levels in 2030. This year's UN Emissions Gap report says that, right now Australia is projected to fall short on what should be a very easy target. ""That 26% reduction needs to be at least double that to be in the Paris Agreement pathway,"" says Dr Bill Hare, who's part of theClimate Action Tracker,externalgroup of scientists who have rated Australia's plans as ""insufficient"". ""There's very little going on whether you're talking about electric vehicles, motor vehicle standards, it's alone in the OECD in not having fuel efficiency standards, it has virtually nothing on energy efficiency, and virtually nothing on building efficiency."" ""It is really an embarrassment actually."" There's a lot of focus on Australia now because of changing world politics. A dispute with China has threatened its exports of coal, while the result of the recent US election has taken away a climate ally of the Australian government. There's even been some talk in recent weeks that the country might soon set a long-term net-zero emissions goal. Andaccording to newspaper reports,external, Australia's Prime Minister Scott Morrison is set to announce that the country will no longer use carbon credits carried over from a previous international climate agreement. Australia had planned to use these questionable credits as a way of making up the shortfall in its 2030 target. ""I think if Trump had won the election then Australia would see themselves as part of a gang with Brazil and Saudi Arabia and a few others,"" said Dr Alison Doig, from the ECIU. But with the dawn of the Biden era, ""they know are in a position that's becoming more outcast. So that might be why there's some softening on local language and the rhetoric"". While action at the federal level in Australia might be slow, lower down there's a good deal of movement. ""Our energy market operator has said that for the power sector in Australia, we're looking at the fastest transition in the world,"" said Dr Bill Hare. ""Everyone knows that we're famous for our sunshine, our wind and our space. And that means that renewables are cheap, they are rapidly outcompeting coal and gas, and those technologies are going to be replaced very quickly."" The EU represents about a fifth of the world's economy - andwas responsible for around 9% of the global share of CO2 emissions in 2019,,externalthe third largest emitter. Climate change is seen as a key issue for Europe, because it's an international problem where acting together makes sense to many citizens. Europe's political leaders also see tackling climate as important in showing the global relevance of the Union. An onshore wind farm in Germany During the Trump administration, the EU stepped into a leadership role, attempting to build bridges with China on how to tackle the challenge. The EU is well-regarded generally among developing countries and small island states because they are seen as wanting to push for greater ambition in terms of cutting carbon. In terms of building a global alliance of rich and poor countries the EU is key. Has the EU lived up to its targets? Mostly, yes. But back in 2007, EU leaders set a goal of cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 20% of their 1990 levels by 2020. By 2018, the collective efforts had cut warming gases by 23.2%. This over-achievement caused many to think that the initial targets had been set far too low. The EU subsequently announced a target of 40% for 2030, but this too came to be viewed as too easy to meet. The bloc has now adopted the aim of having a carbon-neutral economy by 2050, in line with the Paris Agreement. And in theEuropean Green Deal,external, announced in September 2020, the European Commission proposed a new target for cuts of around 55% by 2030. In April 2021, ahead of President Biden's climate leaders' summit, the EU adopted the goal. The European Parliament and many environmentalists had wanted them to go further and aim for a 60% cut. But the proposal ran into trouble with Eastern European member states who argued this was too much, too soon. China is key to solving the global problem with climate change, because it is the world's biggest contributor to the root cause, CO2 emissions. As China's economy rapidly expanded over the past two decades, using coal as their main energy source, their emissions have overtaken the US and now comprise around 28% of the global CO2 output. But China is also the reason for a recent burst of optimism that has spread through the international community since September, when China's President Xi Jinpingtold the UNthat his country would reach carbon neutrality by 2060. China's President Xi meets US President Trump in 2019 Has China lived up to its promises? The answer is mostly, yes, but with some caveats. Seeing itself as a developing country, China has always been reluctant to take on targets to cut carbon, arguing that the West should go first and farthest to rein in CO2. Instead, China has focussed on carbon intensity rather than cuts. This means limiting the amount of CO2 used per unit of economic activity. This is easier to achieve than outright emissions reductions but the downside is that as GDP increases so does the overall total of carbon used. Before the Copenhagen conference of the parties meeting (COP) in 2009, China pledged to cut its carbon intensity by 40-45%, compared to 2005 levels. At the end of 2017, China had cut carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP by 46% from the 2005 level. In the Paris Agreement, China promised to cut carbon intensity by 60-65%, and to peak its emissions by 2030. The country remains on course to meet these goals. In fact,according to some research,external, it could meet them years ahead of schedule. ""I think China took the conservative approach to the Paris Agreement, they only proposed something that they were very sure that they could meet,"" says Niklas HÃ¶hne from the Climate Action Tracker. ""It was also clear that at, the moment when they proposed their 2030 target, that they would over-achieve it. And that doesn't mean that that it's a bad target, per se, but that's their way of approaching it."" When President Xi Jinping told the UN in September that China would reach net-zero in 2060 and peak its emissions well before 2030, the statement was welcomed all over the world. But observers said targets contained in the country's five-year plan, released in March 2021, could lead to emissions continuing to increase. A giant solar farm in China A new Chinese national commitment is to be submitted to the UN in the run up to the Glasgow COP26 meeting. But there are significant challenges. ""The nature of the peaking in the 2030 target can be only measured in a 100% certain way after the fact,"" said Dr Shuwei Zhang, from the Draworld Environment Research Centre in Beijing. ""The 2060 neutrality goal is theoretically possible, but could become unfeasible in reality, if action is continuously delayed."" ""From now, there is no leeway to accommodate coal any longer."" Scientists examine a melting glacier in China China will have to limit coal for energy, not just inside the country but outside as well. The financing of overseas coal power plants will have to wind down. Right now, the country'semissions have rebounded,externalin the wake of the pandemic, as coal continues to burn brightly. But many remain optimistic that, if China says it can do something, then it will get there. The Philippines is one of the countries suffering the most fromthe impacts of climate change. The Philippines has suffered serious impacts from storms and typhoons Like many other developing economies, the country is very keen to use energy to bring people out of poverty and raise living standards. In the past, the Philippines has looked to significantly increase investment in coal to foster development. But its current approach seeks to move away from coal, and experts say the country could be a role model for many developing nations in similar situations. Has the Philippines lived up to its promises? Up until the Paris Agreement, the Philippines had not had any international requirements to curb its carbon. But in the Paris pact, it committed to cut its emissions by 70% below ""business as usual"" by 2030.  According to the Climate Action Tracker analysis, its actions to date are compatible with keeping warming well below 2C this century. In 2019, around half the country's electricity came from coal - and plans in the pipeline would have more than doubled the country's coal fired capacity. But in October 2020,the government announced a moratorium on new coal plants,external, preferring instead to pursue a more mixed energy strategy. According to the Climate Action Tracker, this could curb emissions from the Philippines by 35% on top of their current policy projections by 2030. ""I think that one of the most critical factors is that the market has been very important in the power sector,"" said Dr Bill Hare. ""In other countries in Southeast Asia, we have what's called political economy, vested interests dominate in places such as Vietnam or Indonesia."" ""But in the Philippines, the market has been really important in determining investments for quite some time. And I think that's what we're seeing unfolding, multiplied by a government predisposition now towards renewables, and a realisation that, as a very vulnerable country, they really need to be getting their act together."" The expectation of observers is that with funding from the UN'sGreen Climate Fund,externaland more focus on sustainability from international banks, the move away from fossil fuels in the Philippines in the longer term will likely speed up. The Philippines has not yet set a long-term goal, but it says it is committed to submitting a new national climate plan with enhanced targets. The country will also likely push for further action on a concept known as ""loss and damage"" within the UN negotiation process. For developing nations, this means financial recompense for the impacts of climate change that cannot be avoided or adapted to. But richer countries are strongly resistant, believing that because they contributed the most to carbon emissions, they will be on the hook for compensation for centuries to come.

"Wildfires have been burning in Greece in recent days The world's largest ever report into climate change will be published later, setting out the stark reality of the state of the planet. The study is by theIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change,external- a UN group that looked at more than 14,000 scientific papers. It will be the most up-to-date assessment of how global warming will change the world in the coming decades. Scientists say it will likely be bad news - but with ""nuggets of optimism"". And environmental experts have said it will be a ""massive wake-up call"" to governments to cut emissions. Have countries kept their climate change promises? A really simple guide to climate change Why China's climate policy matters to us all The last time the IPCC looked at the science of global warming was in 2013 - and scientists believe they have learnt a lot since then. In recent years, the world has seen record-breaking temperatures, raging wildfires and devastating flooding. Some papers studied by the panel show that some of the changes humans are inadvertently making to the climate will not be reversed for hundreds or maybe thousands of years. The IPCC's findings - which will be revealed at a press conference at 09:00 BST - will also be used during a major summit hosted by the UK in November. The summit, COP26, which is run by the UN, is seen as a critical moment if climate change is going to be brought under control. Leaders from 196 countries will meet to try and agree action. Alok Sharma, the UK minister who is leading the summit,said at the weekend that theworld was almost running out of time to avoid catastrophe - and the effects of climate change were already happening. The intergovernmental panel brings together representatives of world governments who appraise research by scientists. That means all governments buy into the findings. The last panel was in 2013 and researchers say much has firmed up since then. Previously, for instance, they were reluctant to ascribe extreme events such as heatwaves and torrential rain to being at least partly down to climate change. Now in the case of theheatdome in the USin June, they're confident to say it would have been almost impossible without climate change. They say the world will continue to get hotter. It will also - especially in northern Europe - get wetter, though droughts will increase too as weather patterns shifts. The panel studied papers showing that sea level would continue to rise for hundreds or possibly thousands of years because of heat already trapped in the ocean deep. Research does confirm though, that if politicians can stick to holding global temperature increase down to 1.5C, on pre-industrial times, the worst catastrophes can still be avoided. Prof Piers Forster, an expert in climate change from the University of Leeds, said the report ""will be able to say a whole lot more about the extremes we are experiencing today and it will be able to be categoric that our emissions of greenhouse gases are causing them and they are also going to get worse"". ""The report will come with quite a lot of bad news about where we are and where we're going, but there are going to be nuggets of optimism in there which I think are really good for the climate change negotiations,"" he told LBC. One of the causes for optimism he mentioned was that there is still a chance of keeping global warming to below 1.5 degrees. Experts say the impacts of climate change are far more severe when the increase is greater than 1.5C. So far,global temperatures have climbedto 1.2C above pre-industrial levels. The Paris climate agreement in 2015 established the goal of keeping the increase in the global average temperature to no more than 2C and to try not to surpass 1.5C. Poor countries struggle to cope with climate impact Greece wildfires continue to threaten villages Richard Black, from non-profit advisory group the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, said: ""Coming just before COP26, this report is a massive wake-up call to all those governments that have not yet put forward realistic plans to cut emissions over the next decade. ""It will show that choices made now have a big effect on our future - leading to a runaway world of wild weather impacts and incalculable risks at one end, and at the other a future where climate change is constrained within manageable bounds."" According to many observers, there have been significant improvements in the science in the last few years. ""Our models have gotten better, we have a better understanding of the physics and the chemistry and the biology, and so they're able to simulate and project future temperature changes and precipitation changes much better than they were,"" said Dr Stephen Cornelius from WWF, an observer at IPCC meetings. ""Another change has been that attribution sciences have increased vastly in the last few years. We can make greater links between climate change and extreme weather events."" As well as updates on temperature projections, there will likely be a strong focus on the question of humanity's role in creating the climate crisis. In the last report in 2013, the IPCC said thathumans were the ""dominant cause"" of global warming since the 1950s. The message in the latest report is expected to be even stronger, with warnings of how soon global temperatures could rise 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. Experts say the impacts of climate change are far more severe when the increase is greater than 1.5C. This video can not be played Climate change: How 1.5C could change the world It is expected that this time the IPCC will also outline just how much of an influence humans are having on the oceans, the atmosphere and other aspects of our planetary systems. One of the most important questions concerns sea-level rise. This has long been a controversial issue for the IPCC, with their previous projections scorned by some scientists as far too conservative. ""In the past they have been so reluctant to give a plausible upper limit on sea-level rise, and we hope that they finally come around this time,"" said Prof Arthur Petersen, from UCL in London. As the world has experienced a series of devastating fires and floods in recent months that have been linked to climate change, the report will also include a new chapter linking extreme weather events to rising temperatures. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is a UN body set up in 1988 to assess the science around climate change. The IPCC provides governments with scientific information they can use to develop policies on global heating. The first of its comprehensive Assessment Reports on climate change was released in 1992. The sixth in this series will be split into four volumes, the first of which - covering the physical science behind climate change - will be published on Monday. Further parts of the review will cover impacts and solutions. A summary has been approved in a process involving scientists and representatives of 195 governments.

He's also had solar panels on his roof for the last eight years, and says his home is now zero-carbon. ""People should make whatever effort they can. We've put in a heat pump, but everything helps and people should hold the government to account and make it fulfil its commitments on climate change."" He adds that while he knows the changes he's made are ""difficult and expensive"" for most people, the government should help with grants. AndDave Stevensthinks politicians are shifting the blame by saying people can tackle climate change by changing their own behaviour. ""They ask us to cycle more as if it's going to have a real impact, but, in the same breath, they're announcing billions of pounds to be spent on new road building schemes,"" he says, adding that there should be more tax incentives to encourage change. ""Of course there should be more bike paths, more low carbon electricity, more Low Traffic Neighbourhoods - and not everyone will like everything, we'll all dislike something, but we've got to move ten times faster than we have been doing."" Extreme heat, rainfall and other severe weather events are already more frequent and intense as a result of climate change, and the IPCC warns that as the planet continues to warm, this will only get worse. Here are pictures of some of the extreme weather we've seen in recent months. Wildfires on Evia island in Greece, August: Firefighters are attempting to put out the flames raging on the Greek island this week The North American heatwave, July: The heatwave left huge areas of California bone-dry and prone to wildfires A cooling centre was set up at the Oregon Convention Center in Portland to help people affected by the heatwave Flooding in western Europe, July: The Rhine river flooded the German city of Cologne The Belgian city of LiÃ¨ge was also hit by heavy flooding Flooding in Henan province in China, July: More than 300 people were killed in the flooding in Henan province The IPCC report might seem overwhelming, but there are still things we can do to tackle climate change. Environment correspondent Matt McGrath and Science correspondent Victoria Gill have been discussing their favourite solutions - from carbon taxes to vintage shopping. You can hear more about tackling climate change with Liz Bonnin, on theWhat Planet Are We On Podcast, available now on BBC Sounds. This video can not be played Matt McGrathEnvironment correspondent A recent study shows thatthe percentage of the global population at risk from flooding has risen by almost a quartersince the year 2000. Satellite images were used to document the rise, which is far greater than had been predicted by computer models.

The analysis shows that migration and a growing number of flood events are behind the rapid increase. By 2030, millions more will experience increased flooding due to climate and demographic change, according to the authors of the study, released before today's IPCC report. Flooding is the environmental disaster that impacts more people than any other, say researchers. That view has echoed around the world in recent weeks, with huge inundations destroying lives and property. In this new study, researchers looked at daily satellite imagery to estimate both the extent of flooding and the number of people exposed to over 900 large flood events between 2000 and 2018. They found that between 255 and 290 million people were directly affected - and between 2000 and 2015, the number of people living in these flooded locations increased by 58-86 million. This represents an increase of 20-24% in the proportion of the world population exposed to floods, some 10 times higher than previous estimates. The report warns that both extreme heat and extreme rainfall will become a lot more frequent and intense as global temperatures continue to rise. Both are already worse than pre-industrial levels, as the graphics below show. Satellite images show wildfires on the Greek island of Evia The IPCC's report was published this morning and is already making a huge impact, with world leaders and climate scientists across the globe calling for urgent action. So what have we learned? BBC environment correspondent Matt McGrath has summed up some of the biggest takeaways from the report - andyou can read them in detail here.  Climate campaignerGreta Thunberg has condemned the fashion industryover its ""huge"" contribution to climate change. The Swedish activist told Vogue Scandinavia that fashion brands needed to take responsibility for the environmental impact of their products. She highlighted ""fast fashion that many treat as disposables"". In a separate interview, Thunberg said she now plans to attend the UN climate conference due to be held in Glasgow this November.She had previously said she would skip COP26because she was concerned that the pandemic would leave some countries unable to attend. ""I've said before that I wasn't going to go if it wasn't fair,"" she told Reuters. ""But now they say that they will vaccinate all the delegates that are going
there. If that's considered fair and safe, then I will hopefully
attend."" You've been getting in touch with us with your thoughts on the IPCC report, and to tell us how you incorporate green habits into your lives. Keval Shah, London: My wife and I went vegan 11 years ago. The easiest, fastest and most convenient way to mitigate global warming is for the population to do the same. We need to get policymakers to make the connection now, as an urgent matter, and shift subsidies away from animal agriculture and towards a plant-based food system. Nothing else will work in time to save the planet.  Anne-Marie Moore, Scotland: I grow a variety of plants to attract insects and small animal life. Don't use plastic where unnecessary. Don't drive anymore. Recycling all waste where possible. Monitoring energy use at home. Becoming more aware of issues and behaviours that cause issues so I can educate my family on how to be eco friendly.  Lionel Tay, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia: I educate my six-year-old son on climate change, and how to cut down waste and recycle as much as possible. I share with him the recent BBC news on the wildfires in US, Turkey and Greece, as well as floods in China, Germany, Belgium and India.

David BrownBBC News We've heard stark warnings this morning about the need to limit greenhouse gas emissions - and most of those warnings have been directed at governments. ButChina's carbon emissions are vast and growing, dwarfing those of other countries. Experts agree that without big reductions in China's emissions, the world cannot win the fight against climate change. President Xi Jinping has said his country will aim for its emissions to reach their highest point before 2030 and for carbon neutrality to be achieved by 2060 - but he has not said how China will achieve this extremely ambitious goal. While all countries face problems getting their emissions down, China is facing the biggest challenge. China's per-person emissions are about half those of the US, but its huge 1.4 billion population and explosive economic growth have pushed it way ahead of any other country in its overall emissions. China became the world's largest emitter of carbon dioxide in 2006 and is now responsible for more than a quarter of the world's overall greenhouse gas emissions. The country has some big advantages, particularly its capacity to stick to long-term strategies and mobilise large-scale investments. The Chinese authorities are facing a colossal task. What happens next could hardly be more important. The president of COP26 - the global climate summit in Glasgow this November - says we need ""far more in terms of action"" to control rising global temperatures.

you look at the figures since 1990, weâve managed to reduce carbon emissions by
45% while growing the economy by 80% in that time,â he claimed. Total emissions did fall 45%,externalbetween 1990 and 2019 in the UK. Coronavirus restrictions also led to a big reduction in
the amount coming from the transport sector (that contributed to a 49% fall
between 1990 and 2020). Between 1990 and 2019,the economy grew by 78%,external. Again there was a subsequent Covid affect, with some of that
growth lost due to lockdowns (if you factor that in then the economy grew by
60% between 1990 and 2020). So the claim is supported by the

scary dotted line in the IPCC's sea-level projections - the one that says a
global ocean rise approaching two metres by the end of the century can't be ruled out. This outcome is considered a low probability but it would have major impact if it happened. The line has been included because there are processes that can affect the melting and break-up of ice sheets which scientists still donât yet fully understand. One of these is something called Marine Ice Cliff Instability, or MICI (pron: Mickey). This is a scenario in which ice sheets could crumble away very quickly if the retreating edges of, say, Antarctica exposed extremely tall cliffs of ice. We know from the physics of ice that such structures cannot support their own weight and will slump. The question is: how likely is MICI to take hold in Antarctica and how fast could it progress? Right now, scientists can't answer this. They see some evidence for the process having occurred in the Earth's history; and think if it did happen, it's a possibility only under the most pessimistic warming futures. Dr Rob Larter, a marine geophysicist with the British Antarctic Survey, commented: ""With the present state of knowledge I agree with the description of runaway MICI as a low probability. However, I think it would be negligent to ignore it."" One final word. Don't lose sight of the sea-level rises that this report considers very likely. Remember, every additional centimetre increase in the height of the oceans puts more people at risk of coastal flooding. Valerie Masson-Delmotte, co-chair of the working group behind the IPCC report: Many of the changes set in motion by human-caused climate change are slow processes. These long lasting changes for the most part affect the planet's frozen regions and the oceans. Changes in ice sheets, deep ocean temperature and acidification will continue for centuries to thousands of years, meaning that they are irreversible in our lifetime and will continue for generations to come. The good news is that these irreversible changes can be slowed down with rapid, strong and sustained reductions in emissions.  Hoesung Lee, chairman of the IPCC: It is indisputable that human activities are causing climate change and making extreme weather events more frequent and severe. [The report] shows that climate change is affecting every region on our planet. It explains that strong, rapid, sustained reduction in carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions will be required to limit global warming.  Petteri Taalas, secretary-general of the World Meteorological Organization: Have we lost hope? No and yes.

"China's carbon emissions are vast and growing, dwarfing those of other countries. Experts agree that without big reductions in China's emissions, the world cannot win the fight against climate change. In 2020, China's President Xi Jinping said his country would aim for its emissions to reach their highest point before 2030 and for carbon neutrality before 2060. His statement has now been confirmed as China's official position ahead of the COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow. But China has not said exactly how these goals will be achieved. While all countries face problems getting their emissions down, China is facing the biggest challenge. Per person, China's emissions are about half those of the US, but its huge 1.4 billion population and explosive economic growth have pushed it way ahead of any other country in its overall emissions. Your device may not support this visualisation China became the world's largest emitter of carbon dioxide in 2006 and is now responsible for more than a quarter of the world's overall greenhouse gas emissions. It is expected to come under intense scrutiny at the COP26 summit over its commitments to reduce these. Along with all the other signatories to the Paris Agreement in 2015, China agreed to make changes to try to keep global warming at 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, and ""well below"" 2C. China strengthened its commitments in 2020, but Climate Action Tracker, an international group of scientists and policy experts say its current actions to meet that goal are ""highly insufficient"". Getting China's emissions down is achievable, according to many experts, but will require a radical shift. Coal has been the country's main source of energy for decades. President Xi says China will ""phase down"" coal use from 2026 - and willnot build new coal-fired projects abroad- but some governments and campaignerssay the plans are not going far enough. Researchers atTsinghua University in Beijing say,externalChina will need to stop using coal entirely for generating electricity by 2050, to be replaced by nuclear and renewable energy production. And far from shutting down coal-fired power stations, China is currently building new ones at more than 60 locations across the country, with many sites having more than one plant. New stations are usually active for 30 to 40 years, so China will need to reduce the capacity of newer plants as well as close old ones if it is to bring emissions down, says researcher Philippe Ciais of the Institute of Environment and Climate Science in Paris. It may be possible to retrofit some to capture emissions, but the technology to do so at scale is still developing, and many plants will have to be written off after minimal use. China argues it has a right to do what Western countries have done in the past, releasing carbon dioxide in the process of developing its economy and reducing poverty. In the short term, Beijing has ordered coal mines toincrease productionto avoid power shortages over the coming winter. Surging demand from heavy industry in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic has led to shortages in several regions of the country in recent weeks. Tsinghua University researchers say 90% of power should come from nuclear and renewables by 2050. In moving towards that goal, China's lead in the manufacture of green technology, such as solar panels and large-scale batteries, may be a big help. China first embraced green technologies as a means to tackle air pollution, a serious problem for many cities. But the government also believes they have enormous economic potential, providing jobs and income for millions of Chinese, as well as reducing China's dependence on foreign oil and gas. ""China is already leading the global energy transition,"" says Yue Cao of the Overseas Development Institute. ""One of the reasons we are able to deploy cheaper and cheaper green technology is China."" China generates more solar power than any other country. That might not be so impressive given China's enormous population, but it is a sign of where the country is heading. China's wind power installations were more than triple those of any other country in 2020. China says the proportion of its energy generated from non-fossil fuel sources should be 25% by 2030, and it is expected by many observers to hit the target early. China ranks seventh in the world for its percentage of car sales that are electric, but given its huge size, China makes and buys more electric cars than any other country by a considerable margin. Currently, about one in 20 cars bought in China is electric-powered. By 2035, Chinese officials and car industry representatives are predicting that almost all new vehicles sold in China will be fully electric-powered or hybrid. Working out by how much the shift to electric vehicles reduces emissions is not straightforward - particularly when taking into account manufacturing and charging sources. But studies suggest that emissions over the lifetimes of electric vehicles are typically below those of petrol and diesel equivalents. This matters because transport is responsible for around a quarter of carbon emissions from fuel combustion, withroad vehicles,externalbeing the largest emitters. China will also by 2025 be producing batteries with double the capacity of those produced by the rest of the world combined. Observers say that will enable the storage and release of energy from renewable sources on a previously impossible scale. Getting to net-zero greenhouse gas emissions doesn't mean that China will stop producing emissions. It means China will cut emissions as much as possible and absorb what's left, through a combination of different approaches. Increasing the area of land covered in vegetation will help, as plants absorb carbon dioxide. Here again, there is encouraging news. China isgetting greener,externalat a faster rate than any other country, largely as a result of its forestry programmes designed to reduce soil erosion and pollution. It is also partly a result of replanting fields to produce more than one harvest per year, which keeps land covered in vegetation for longer. The world needs China to succeed. ""Unless China decarbonises, we're not going to beat climate change,"" says prof David Tyfield of the Lancaster Environment Centre. China has some big advantages, particularly its capacity to stick to long-term strategies and mobilise large-scale investments. The Chinese authorities are facing a colossal task.

"The world's largest ever report into climate change is published, setting out the stark reality of the state of the planet The study, by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, says it is ""unequivocal"" that human activity is responsible for global warming Some changes, like sea-level rises, are irreversible, the study finds But there is new hope that deep cuts in emissions of greenhouse gases could stabilise rising temperatures It is the most up-to-date assessment of how global warming will change the world in the coming decades, and looked at more than 14,000 scientific papers Environmental experts have said it is a ""massive wake-up call"" to governments to cut emissions In recent years, the world has seen record-breaking temperatures, raging wildfires and devastating flooding Edited by Hugo Bachega We're ending our live updates following the release of the landmark UN report on climate change. Thank you for joining us. Here are the key points:  You can find out more about the report here. Today's updates were brought to you by Ashitha Nagesh, David Walker and Toby Luckhurst. The editors were Hugo Bachega and Robert Greenall. There's been a lot to digest from the climate report, and you may be asking yourself: What can I do?

Bradford. ""What we do as individuals can make a real difference,"" he says. He's had a heat pump installed at the front of his house and has had his home fully insulated. He's also had solar panels on his roof for the last eight years, and says his home is now zero-carbon. ""People should make whatever effort they can. We've put in a heat pump, but everything helps and people should hold the government to account and make it fulfil its commitments on climate change."" He adds that while he knows the changes he's made are ""difficult and expensive"" for most people, the government should help with grants. AndDave Stevensthinks politicians are shifting the blame by saying people can tackle climate change by changing their own behaviour. ""They ask us to cycle more as if it's going to have a real impact, but, in the same breath, they're announcing billions of pounds to be spent on new road building schemes,"" he says, adding that there should be more tax incentives to encourage change. ""Of course there should be more bike paths, more low carbon electricity, more Low Traffic Neighbourhoods - and not everyone will like everything, we'll all dislike something, but we've got to move ten times faster than we have been doing."" Extreme heat, rainfall and other severe weather events are already more frequent and intense as a result of climate change, and the IPCC warns that as the planet continues to warm, this will only get worse. Here are pictures of some of the extreme weather we've seen in recent months. Wildfires on Evia island in Greece, August: Firefighters are attempting to put out the flames raging on the Greek island this week The North American heatwave, July: The heatwave left huge areas of California bone-dry and prone to wildfires A cooling centre was set up at the Oregon Convention Center in Portland to help people affected by the heatwave Flooding in western Europe, July: The Rhine river flooded the German city of Cologne The Belgian city of LiÃ¨ge was also hit by heavy flooding Flooding in Henan province in China, July: More than 300 people were killed in the flooding in Henan province The IPCC report might seem overwhelming, but there are still things we can do to tackle climate change. Environment correspondent Matt McGrath and Science correspondent Victoria Gill have been discussing their favourite solutions - from carbon taxes to vintage shopping. You can hear more about tackling climate change with Liz Bonnin, on theWhat Planet Are We On Podcast, available now on BBC Sounds. This video can not be played Matt McGrathEnvironment correspondent A recent study shows thatthe percentage of the global population at risk from flooding has risen by almost a quartersince the year 2000. Satellite images were used to document the rise, which is far greater than had been predicted by computer models.

The analysis shows that migration and a growing number of flood events are behind the rapid increase. By 2030, millions more will experience increased flooding due to climate and demographic change, according to the authors of the study, released before today's IPCC report. Flooding is the environmental disaster that impacts more people than any other, say researchers. That view has echoed around the world in recent weeks, with huge inundations destroying lives and property. In this new study, researchers looked at daily satellite imagery to estimate both the extent of flooding and the number of people exposed to over 900 large flood events between 2000 and 2018. They found that between 255 and 290 million people were directly affected - and between 2000 and 2015, the number of people living in these flooded locations increased by 58-86 million. This represents an increase of 20-24% in the proportion of the world population exposed to floods, some 10 times higher than previous estimates. The report warns that both extreme heat and extreme rainfall will become a lot more frequent and intense as global temperatures continue to rise. Both are already worse than pre-industrial levels, as the graphics below show. Satellite images show wildfires on the Greek island of Evia The IPCC's report was published this morning and is already making a huge impact, with world leaders and climate scientists across the globe calling for urgent action. So what have we learned? BBC environment correspondent Matt McGrath has summed up some of the biggest takeaways from the report - andyou can read them in detail here.  Climate campaignerGreta Thunberg has condemned the fashion industryover its ""huge"" contribution to climate change. The Swedish activist told Vogue Scandinavia that fashion brands needed to take responsibility for the environmental impact of their products. She highlighted ""fast fashion that many treat as disposables"". In a separate interview, Thunberg said she now plans to attend the UN climate conference due to be held in Glasgow this November.She had previously said she would skip COP26because she was concerned that the pandemic would leave some countries unable to attend. ""I've said before that I wasn't going to go if it wasn't fair,"" she told Reuters. ""But now they say that they will vaccinate all the delegates that are going
there. If that's considered fair and safe, then I will hopefully
attend."" You've been getting in touch with us with your thoughts on the IPCC report, and to tell us how you incorporate green habits into your lives. Keval Shah, London: My wife and I went vegan 11 years ago. The easiest, fastest and most convenient way to mitigate global warming is for the population to do the same. We need to get policymakers to make the connection now, as an urgent matter, and shift subsidies away from animal agriculture and towards a plant-based food system. Nothing else will work in time to save the planet.  Anne-Marie Moore, Scotland: I grow a variety of plants to attract insects and small animal life. Don't use plastic where unnecessary. Don't drive anymore. Recycling all waste where possible. Monitoring energy use at home. Becoming more aware of issues and behaviours that cause issues so I can educate my family on how to be eco friendly.  Lionel Tay, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia: I educate my six-year-old son on climate change, and how to cut down waste and recycle as much as possible.

"Wildfires have been burning in Greece in recent days The world's largest ever report into climate change will be published later, setting out the stark reality of the state of the planet. The study is by theIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change,external- a UN group that looked at more than 14,000 scientific papers. It will be the most up-to-date assessment of how global warming will change the world in the coming decades. Scientists say it will likely be bad news - but with ""nuggets of optimism"". And environmental experts have said it will be a ""massive wake-up call"" to governments to cut emissions. Have countries kept their climate change promises? A really simple guide to climate change Why China's climate policy matters to us all The last time the IPCC looked at the science of global warming was in 2013 - and scientists believe they have learnt a lot since then. In recent years, the world has seen record-breaking temperatures, raging wildfires and devastating flooding. Some papers studied by the panel show that some of the changes humans are inadvertently making to the climate will not be reversed for hundreds or maybe thousands of years. The IPCC's findings - which will be revealed at a press conference at 09:00 BST - will also be used during a major summit hosted by the UK in November. The summit, COP26, which is run by the UN, is seen as a critical moment if climate change is going to be brought under control. Leaders from 196 countries will meet to try and agree action. Alok Sharma, the UK minister who is leading the summit,said at the weekend that theworld was almost running out of time to avoid catastrophe - and the effects of climate change were already happening. The intergovernmental panel brings together representatives of world governments who appraise research by scientists. That means all governments buy into the findings. The last panel was in 2013 and researchers say much has firmed up since then. Previously, for instance, they were reluctant to ascribe extreme events such as heatwaves and torrential rain to being at least partly down to climate change. Now in the case of theheatdome in the USin June, they're confident to say it would have been almost impossible without climate change. They say the world will continue to get hotter. It will also - especially in northern Europe - get wetter, though droughts will increase too as weather patterns shifts. The panel studied papers showing that sea level would continue to rise for hundreds or possibly thousands of years because of heat already trapped in the ocean deep. Research does confirm though, that if politicians can stick to holding global temperature increase down to 1.5C, on pre-industrial times, the worst catastrophes can still be avoided. Prof Piers Forster, an expert in climate change from the University of Leeds, said the report ""will be able to say a whole lot more about the extremes we are experiencing today and it will be able to be categoric that our emissions of greenhouse gases are causing them and they are also going to get worse"". ""The report will come with quite a lot of bad news about where we are and where we're going, but there are going to be nuggets of optimism in there which I think are really good for the climate change negotiations,"" he told LBC. One of the causes for optimism he mentioned was that there is still a chance of keeping global warming to below 1.5 degrees. Experts say the impacts of climate change are far more severe when the increase is greater than 1.5C. So far,global temperatures have climbedto 1.2C above pre-industrial levels. The Paris climate agreement in 2015 established the goal of keeping the increase in the global average temperature to no more than 2C and to try not to surpass 1.5C. Poor countries struggle to cope with climate impact Greece wildfires continue to threaten villages Richard Black, from non-profit advisory group the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, said: ""Coming just before COP26, this report is a massive wake-up call to all those governments that have not yet put forward realistic plans to cut emissions over the next decade. ""It will show that choices made now have a big effect on our future - leading to a runaway world of wild weather impacts and incalculable risks at one end, and at the other a future where climate change is constrained within manageable bounds."" According to many observers, there have been significant improvements in the science in the last few years. ""Our models have gotten better, we have a better understanding of the physics and the chemistry and the biology, and so they're able to simulate and project future temperature changes and precipitation changes much better than they were,"" said Dr Stephen Cornelius from WWF, an observer at IPCC meetings.

"Wildfires have been burning in Greece in recent days The world's largest ever report into climate change will be published later, setting out the stark reality of the state of the planet. The study is by theIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change,external- a UN group that looked at more than 14,000 scientific papers. It will be the most up-to-date assessment of how global warming will change the world in the coming decades. Scientists say it will likely be bad news - but with ""nuggets of optimism"". And environmental experts have said it will be a ""massive wake-up call"" to governments to cut emissions. Have countries kept their climate change promises? A really simple guide to climate change Why China's climate policy matters to us all The last time the IPCC looked at the science of global warming was in 2013 - and scientists believe they have learnt a lot since then. In recent years, the world has seen record-breaking temperatures, raging wildfires and devastating flooding. Some papers studied by the panel show that some of the changes humans are inadvertently making to the climate will not be reversed for hundreds or maybe thousands of years. The IPCC's findings - which will be revealed at a press conference at 09:00 BST - will also be used during a major summit hosted by the UK in November. The summit, COP26, which is run by the UN, is seen as a critical moment if climate change is going to be brought under control. Leaders from 196 countries will meet to try and agree action. Alok Sharma, the UK minister who is leading the summit,said at the weekend that theworld was almost running out of time to avoid catastrophe - and the effects of climate change were already happening. The intergovernmental panel brings together representatives of world governments who appraise research by scientists. That means all governments buy into the findings. The last panel was in 2013 and researchers say much has firmed up since then. Previously, for instance, they were reluctant to ascribe extreme events such as heatwaves and torrential rain to being at least partly down to climate change. Now in the case of theheatdome in the USin June, they're confident to say it would have been almost impossible without climate change. They say the world will continue to get hotter. It will also - especially in northern Europe - get wetter, though droughts will increase too as weather patterns shifts. The panel studied papers showing that sea level would continue to rise for hundreds or possibly thousands of years because of heat already trapped in the ocean deep. Research does confirm though, that if politicians can stick to holding global temperature increase down to 1.5C, on pre-industrial times, the worst catastrophes can still be avoided. Prof Piers Forster, an expert in climate change from the University of Leeds, said the report ""will be able to say a whole lot more about the extremes we are experiencing today and it will be able to be categoric that our emissions of greenhouse gases are causing them and they are also going to get worse"". ""The report will come with quite a lot of bad news about where we are and where we're going, but there are going to be nuggets of optimism in there which I think are really good for the climate change negotiations,"" he told LBC. One of the causes for optimism he mentioned was that there is still a chance of keeping global warming to below 1.5 degrees. Experts say the impacts of climate change are far more severe when the increase is greater than 1.5C. So far,global temperatures have climbedto 1.2C above pre-industrial levels. The Paris climate agreement in 2015 established the goal of keeping the increase in the global average temperature to no more than 2C and to try not to surpass 1.5C. Poor countries struggle to cope with climate impact Greece wildfires continue to threaten villages Richard Black, from non-profit advisory group the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, said: ""Coming just before COP26, this report is a massive wake-up call to all those governments that have not yet put forward realistic plans to cut emissions over the next decade. ""It will show that choices made now have a big effect on our future - leading to a runaway world of wild weather impacts and incalculable risks at one end, and at the other a future where climate change is constrained within manageable bounds."" According to many observers, there have been significant improvements in the science in the last few years. ""Our models have gotten better, we have a better understanding of the physics and the chemistry and the biology, and so they're able to simulate and project future temperature changes and precipitation changes much better than they were,"" said Dr Stephen Cornelius from WWF, an observer at IPCC meetings. ""Another change has been that attribution sciences have increased vastly in the last few years. We can make greater links between climate change and extreme weather events."" As well as updates on temperature projections, there will likely be a strong focus on the question of humanity's role in creating the climate crisis.

"There were plenty of incredible moments in Tokyo in what was one of the most controversial Olympics in modern history Tokyo's spectacular early evening skies, as the light fades and the energy-sapping heat and humidity of the day starts to ease, is one of the things that many visitors to the city this summer will miss most. But as the sun sets on a Games like no other, and the Olympic family prepares to pack up and leave town, thoughts will now turn to how one of the most controversial sports events in modern history will be remembered in years to come. Every Games is different of course. But Tokyo 2020 was truly unprecedented. Regardless of the undoubted sporting drama that has unfolded here over the last 17 days, it will always be the Covid Olympics. The first such event to be staged since the start of the pandemic, the first to take place amid a state of emergency, and the only one to be stripped of spectators. Given those challenges, the fact this event was completed at all, and provided so many special moments, will be viewed by some as a minor miracle. By others, as a powerful symbol of sport's defiance and the hosts' resilience. A gamble that has paid off. But at the same time, rarely before has the judgement and motives of the organisers been under such scrutiny. These Gamesraised major questionsfor the International Olympic Committee in particular, and it will be some time before the wisdom of its decision to press on with the Olympics can be properly evaluated. The Sports Desk podcast: Has Biles changed the game on mental health? Reporting on theopening ceremony- traditionally one of the world's great shared experiences - in Tokyo's stunning but empty National Stadium, with the athletes' parade depleted, sponsors missing, a noisy protest by campaigners outside, and local people locked out of their own Â£12bn party, was among the saddest and most surreal experiences I can recall. It will be hard to find a more potent image of the pandemic age. But in what was effectively a made-for-TV event, the contrast between the experiences of those of us on the ground here, and viewers watching on from afar has rarely felt so stark. Having experienced the vibrant, joyous atmospheres at London 2012 and Rio 2016, and more recently the crowds allowed at the Euros earlier this summer, covering an Olympics without spectators made for a very strange experience. Each visit to a venue without fans was inevitably accompanied by questions over what might have been, and where else the billions lavished on these Games could have been spent. The endless rules, restrictions and daily testing, along with the constant fear of being 'pinged' and sent away for two weeks' isolation ensured a highly anxious and stressful Games, for athletes, officials, and the media. But just as Rio emerged as an iconic Games despite the many challenges it faced, the sense is that, once again, the athletes have come to the rescue of Tokyo 2020. In Britain, despite the unhelpful time difference, fears of images of empty venues, and a troubled build-up to the event, many have loved watching it, and will remember these Olympics as a classic. Morning after morning, the country woke up to spellbinding stories of Team GB medals, a new generation of stars, an array of inspiring performances, and innovative new sports and mixed gender formats that captured the imagination. Complete Tokyo 2020 medal table Who won GB's medals? This video can not be played The secrets of BBC Sport's Tokyo Olympics studio As with the Euros earlier this summer, the Games have felt more needed and appreciated than ever by a Covid-weary nation desperately in need of something to distract and inspire. Who could fail to be struck by the historic achievements of British Olympians such asJasonandLaura KennyandDuncan Scott?OfHannah MillsandCharlotte Dujardin?But also the emergence of lesser known, but no less inspirational names, such asEmily Campbell,Galal Yafai,Alex Yee,Charlotte WorthingtonandBethany Shriever? Who was not moved by the tears of joy ofTom DaleyandJames Guy,and those ofDina Asher-Smith,borne out of frustration after her hopes of sprint glory were dashed? Or impressed by the overall excellence of Britain's swimming, boxing and sailing teams? Who could have seen the excitement, joy and passion of swimmerTom Dean's friends and family,watching on from Maidenhead as he took gold in the pool, and not smiled at this outpouring of pride, such a heart-warming symbol of the years of sacrifice and belief, finally fulfilled? Every parent and coach who gives up their time to support a young athlete would have understood what those jubilant scenes represented. World records, shock results and iconic sportsmanship all helped to define a Games that delivered no shortage of compelling storylines. 21 striking photographs from Tokyo 2020 How closely have you been paying attention to Tokyo 2020? Indeed for every athlete here, Tokyo 2020 stands as a triumph of resilience, despite the challenges that a delayed Games and lockdowns presented. The IOC maintains the decision to press on with the postponed Games, despite opposition from most of a largely unvaccinated Japanese public and local medical experts, was done with the blessing of the World Health Organisation, and with the interests of these athletes at heart. And most competitors (as well as the those who enjoyed watching) will undoubtedly be grateful that years of training did not go to waste, especially those for whom this will have been their only chance to be an Olympian. Athletes gave Games great soul, says IOC president Bach The success of Japan in the medal table also seems to have helped mellow some of the anger towards the event. On Friday night the protesters were still outside the athletics stadium, but it was a noticeably smaller, less vocal group. But many critics insist it was the multi-billion dollar broadcast contracts that the Olympic movement relies on that were the real reason for its refusal to countenance another delay or cancellation, and some believe this will mean more scrutiny of the IOC going forward. Perhaps it will also make it harder to attract bidders, even if the next three hosts of the summer Games are now secured up to 2032. With much of Tokyo society carrying on as normal despite the state of emergency, at times it was hard to understand the need for spectators to be banned, especially from the large, outdoor venues. Organisers however can point to the fact that there has only been 438 positive cases from people affiliated with the Games, despite tens of thousands of visitors from overseas. The sports industry will now hope this shows that with strict protocols, the virus can be kept at bay, even at an event as complicated and sprawling as this. Equally, while some highly unfortunate athletes have been prevented from competing, fears of a major outbreak in the athletes village, with competitions ruined, have proved unfounded. And yet, outside of the Olympic bubble, the reality is that since officials and athletes started arriving in Tokyo last month, positive cases in Tokyo have surged from around a thousand a day to a record high of more than five thousand on Thursday. Organisers insist there is no evidence linking this to the Games, but others believe the fact the event was on has led to people relaxing and being less disciplined in their precautions. With the Japan government asking Covid patients with moderate symptoms to isolate at home instead of the increasingly over-stretched hospitals, the decision to continue with the Games could still come back to haunt the country if cases continue to surge over the coming weeks. Tokyo 2020 meant scrutiny of the IOC for other reasons too. The issue of athlete welfare was raised by theextreme heatthat competitors were expected to contend with. The plight of Belarusian sprinter Krystina Timanovskaya, whose coaches allegedly attempted toforce her to leave the Gamesin Tokyo, highlighted the treatment of athletes in Belarus, and whether the IOC should do more to stand up for them. Theparticipation of weightlifter Laurel Hubbard,the first openly transgender athlete to compete in a different gender category to that which they were born at an Olympics, was another milestone in one of sport's most contentious issues, intensifying debate over the IOC's transgender policy. And whether it wasSimone Biles raising awareness of mental healthand the pressure that some athletes struggle to cope with, Holly Bradshaw talking about body-shaming, Hannah Mills about climate change, US shot-putter Raven Saunders, whose cross-wristed gesture on the podium supported racial and social justice, or Ross Greenbank, who raised concerns over Russian doping, the sense was that the importance of these Games went way beyond medals. This video can not be played Relive some of the best bits from the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games This was the first summer Olympics to be held since Russia's ban for its great state-sponsored doping scandal. And yetyou would have hardly noticed.While the team, flag and anthem were officially barred, more than 330 athletes represented the 'ROC', and performed better than Russia did at either the 2012 or 2016 Olympics. For many critics, a top five finish in the medal table makes a mockery of the punishment, and taints the legacy of Tokyo 2020, proving the inherent weakness of authorities charged with protecting clean sport. Given the restrictions on anti-doping officials during the pandemic, it would also be little surprise if, as with other recent Games, a number of results end up being changed, and medals re-awarded in the years to come, thanks to retrospective testing. Given the spate of athlete welfare scandals in recent years, a new emphasis on winning 'in the right way', and expectations that the Team GB medal tally would suffer a 'correction' after the remarkable second-place finish at Rio, the haul achieved in Tokyo will be seen as a major triumph. The failure of traditional powerhouse rowing will see funding agency UK Sport come under pressure to redistribute some of the millions it receives, but any disappointment has been balanced by the success of other disciplines, especially those like BMX and skateboarding, which have the potential to attract new and younger audiences. To have won as many medals as in London, and in more sports than any other nation is a significant achievement, and many will now desperately hope that this translates to a new emphasis by policy-makers on community and school sport, after the damage lockdowns have done to participation rates and grassroots facilities. Many thought a new focus on duty of care would mean less medal success, but perhaps Tokyo proves it need not be 'either or'. Eight years ago I was in Buenos Aires to see Tokyo awarded the 2020 Games. Just as the city's first Olympics in 1964 was about re-emerging from the impact of World War Two, the promise to use its second to symbolise the country's recovery after the 2011 earthquake and tsunami disaster was a compelling one. Instead of course, it was another huge crisis that has come to define this event. But ultimately, even something as monumental as the pandemic could not deny the Games. Many will be relieved. Others dismayed. And whether it was right that the Olympics happened at all will always be a matter for debate. But what seems certain is that, as ever, the athletes proved an uplifting and irrepressible force, even in these times of doubt.

"The world's largest ever report into climate change is published, setting out the stark reality of the state of the planet The study, by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, says it is ""unequivocal"" that human activity is responsible for global warming Some changes, like sea-level rises, are irreversible, the study finds But there is new hope that deep cuts in emissions of greenhouse gases could stabilise rising temperatures It is the most up-to-date assessment of how global warming will change the world in the coming decades, and looked at more than 14,000 scientific papers Environmental experts have said it is a ""massive wake-up call"" to governments to cut emissions In recent years, the world has seen record-breaking temperatures, raging wildfires and devastating flooding Edited by Hugo Bachega We're ending our live updates following the release of the landmark UN report on climate change. Thank you for joining us. Here are the key points:  You can find out more about the report here. Today's updates were brought to you by Ashitha Nagesh, David Walker and Toby Luckhurst. The editors were Hugo Bachega and Robert Greenall. There's been a lot to digest from the climate report, and you may be asking yourself: What can I do?

climate negotiator for the Alliance of Small Island States: If we keep warming to 1.5C, we're still facing 0.5m of sea level rise. But if we stop warming from reaching 2C, we can avoid a long-term three metres of sea level rise. That is our very future, right there.

Bradford. ""What we do as individuals can make a real difference,"" he says. He's had a heat pump installed at the front of his house and has had his home fully insulated. He's also had solar panels on his roof for the last eight years, and says his home is now zero-carbon. ""People should make whatever effort they can. We've put in a heat pump, but everything helps and people should hold the government to account and make it fulfil its commitments on climate change."" He adds that while he knows the changes he's made are ""difficult and expensive"" for most people, the government should help with grants. AndDave Stevensthinks politicians are shifting the blame by saying people can tackle climate change by changing their own behaviour. ""They ask us to cycle more as if it's going to have a real impact, but, in the same breath, they're announcing billions of pounds to be spent on new road building schemes,"" he says, adding that there should be more tax incentives to encourage change. ""Of course there should be more bike paths, more low carbon electricity, more Low Traffic Neighbourhoods - and not everyone will like everything, we'll all dislike something, but we've got to move ten times faster than we have been doing."" Extreme heat, rainfall and other severe weather events are already more frequent and intense as a result of climate change, and the IPCC warns that as the planet continues to warm, this will only get worse. Here are pictures of some of the extreme weather we've seen in recent months. Wildfires on Evia island in Greece, August: Firefighters are attempting to put out the flames raging on the Greek island this week The North American heatwave, July: The heatwave left huge areas of California bone-dry and prone to wildfires A cooling centre was set up at the Oregon Convention Center in Portland to help people affected by the heatwave Flooding in western Europe, July: The Rhine river flooded the German city of Cologne The Belgian city of LiÃ¨ge was also hit by heavy flooding Flooding in Henan province in China, July: More than 300 people were killed in the flooding in Henan province The IPCC report might seem overwhelming, but there are still things we can do to tackle climate change. Environment correspondent Matt McGrath and Science correspondent Victoria Gill have been discussing their favourite solutions - from carbon taxes to vintage shopping. You can hear more about tackling climate change with Liz Bonnin, on theWhat Planet Are We On Podcast, available now on BBC Sounds. This video can not be played Matt McGrathEnvironment correspondent A recent study shows thatthe percentage of the global population at risk from flooding has risen by almost a quartersince the year 2000. Satellite images were used to document the rise, which is far greater than had been predicted by computer models.

The analysis shows that migration and a growing number of flood events are behind the rapid increase. By 2030, millions more will experience increased flooding due to climate and demographic change, according to the authors of the study, released before today's IPCC report. Flooding is the environmental disaster that impacts more people than any other, say researchers. That view has echoed around the world in recent weeks, with huge inundations destroying lives and property. In this new study, researchers looked at daily satellite imagery to estimate both the extent of flooding and the number of people exposed to over 900 large flood events between 2000 and 2018. They found that between 255 and 290 million people were directly affected - and between 2000 and 2015, the number of people living in these flooded locations increased by 58-86 million. This represents an increase of 20-24% in the proportion of the world population exposed to floods, some 10 times higher than previous estimates. The report warns that both extreme heat and extreme rainfall will become a lot more frequent and intense as global temperatures continue to rise. Both are already worse than pre-industrial levels, as the graphics below show. Satellite images show wildfires on the Greek island of Evia The IPCC's report was published this morning and is already making a huge impact, with world leaders and climate scientists across the globe calling for urgent action. So what have we learned? BBC environment correspondent Matt McGrath has summed up some of the biggest takeaways from the report - andyou can read them in detail here.  Climate campaignerGreta Thunberg has condemned the fashion industryover its ""huge"" contribution to climate change. The Swedish activist told Vogue Scandinavia that fashion brands needed to take responsibility for the environmental impact of their products. She highlighted ""fast fashion that many treat as disposables"". In a separate interview, Thunberg said she now plans to attend the UN climate conference due to be held in Glasgow this November.She had previously said she would skip COP26because she was concerned that the pandemic would leave some countries unable to attend. ""I've said before that I wasn't going to go if it wasn't fair,"" she told Reuters. ""But now they say that they will vaccinate all the delegates that are going
there. If that's considered fair and safe, then I will hopefully
attend."" You've been getting in touch with us with your thoughts on the IPCC report, and to tell us how you incorporate green habits into your lives. Keval Shah, London: My wife and I went vegan 11 years ago. The easiest, fastest and most convenient way to mitigate global warming is for the population to do the same. We need to get policymakers to make the connection now, as an urgent matter, and shift subsidies away from animal agriculture and towards a plant-based food system. Nothing else will work in time to save the planet.  Anne-Marie Moore, Scotland: I grow a variety of plants to attract insects and small animal life. Don't use plastic where unnecessary. Don't drive anymore. Recycling all waste where possible. Monitoring energy use at home. Becoming more aware of issues and behaviours that cause issues so I can educate my family on how to be eco friendly.  Lionel Tay, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia: I educate my six-year-old son on climate change, and how to cut down waste and recycle as much as possible. I share with him the recent BBC news on the wildfires in US, Turkey and Greece, as well as floods in China, Germany, Belgium and India. This Covid-19 lockdown was perfect timing for us to show him how we can cut down usage of water, electricity and other resources at home.  Brylie Christopher Oxley, Finland: Living with my son in a 50sqm apartment and without owning a private car. We're also primarily vegetarian, although we eat fish and some dairy (also oat milk substitute). Setting these kinds of constraints encourages more sustainable choices by default.  Esther McVey is one Conservative worried about the costs of changes designed to reduce carbon emissions A small group of Conservative MPs in the UK have saidthey fear the costs of tackling climate change will harm poor families. Former cabinet minister Esther McVey is one of the Tory MPs worried about the cost of changing boilers and insulating homes. ""What I would never want to do is bankrupt the country,"" she said. ""We don't go green and go red as a country at the same time."" But many others in the UK's ruling party have backed the government's net zero carbon target. Sam Hall, director of the Conservative Environment Network, which says it has the support of 105 Tory MPs, said the UK has a ""huge opportunity"" to lead the world. Environment Minister Zac Goldsmith has called the IPCC report ""appalling reading"". David BrownBBC News We've heard stark warnings this morning about the need to limit greenhouse gas emissions - and most of those warnings have been directed at governments. ButChina's carbon emissions are vast and growing, dwarfing those of other countries. Experts agree that without big reductions in China's emissions, the world cannot win the fight against climate change. President Xi Jinping has said his country will aim for its emissions to reach their highest point before 2030 and for carbon neutrality to be achieved by 2060 - but he has not said how China will achieve this extremely ambitious goal. While all countries face problems getting their emissions down, China is facing the biggest challenge. China's per-person emissions are about half those of the US, but its huge 1.4 billion population and explosive economic growth have pushed it way ahead of any other country in its overall emissions. China became the world's largest emitter of carbon dioxide in 2006 and is now responsible for more than a quarter of the world's overall greenhouse gas emissions. The country has some big advantages, particularly its capacity to stick to long-term strategies and mobilise large-scale investments. The Chinese authorities are facing a colossal task. What happens next could hardly be more important. The president of COP26 - the global climate summit in Glasgow this November - says we need ""far more in terms of action"" to control rising global temperatures. Alok Sharma said the G20 group of nations was ""absolutely key"" to meeting targets, as they produced 80% of global emissions. This video can not be played We've heard stark warnings about the rise in global temperature today. But what does that actually look like? Reality Check UK Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng
said this morning that cutting emissions does not necessarily need to mean the
economy shrinking. âIf
you look at the figures since 1990, weâve managed to reduce carbon emissions by
45% while growing the economy by 80% in that time,â he claimed. Total emissions did fall 45%,externalbetween 1990 and 2019 in the UK. Coronavirus restrictions also led to a big reduction in
the amount coming from the transport sector (that contributed to a 49% fall
between 1990 and 2020). Between 1990 and 2019,the economy grew by 78%,external. Again there was a subsequent Covid affect, with some of that
growth lost due to lockdowns (if you factor that in then the economy grew by
60% between 1990 and 2020). So the claim is supported by the
2019 figures, but those are now somewhat out of date. This video can not be played Greece wildfires: 'It's like a horror movie but it's real life' Today's report makes it clear that the effects of climate change caused by human activity can already be seen around the world in extreme heatwaves, heavy rainfall, droughts and tropical cyclones. It comes as Greece experiences its most severe heatwave in 30 years, with devastating wildfires on the island of Evia. If you are just joining us, here is a round-up of today's main events: Jonathan AmosScience correspondent We need to talk about that
scary dotted line in the IPCC's sea-level projections - the one that says a
global ocean rise approaching two metres by the end of the century can't be ruled out. This outcome is considered a low probability but it would have major impact if it happened. The line has been included because there are processes that can affect the melting and break-up of ice sheets which scientists still donât yet fully understand. One of these is something called Marine Ice Cliff Instability, or MICI (pron: Mickey). This is a scenario in which ice sheets could crumble away very quickly if the retreating edges of, say, Antarctica exposed extremely tall cliffs of ice. We know from the physics of ice that such structures cannot support their own weight and will slump. The question is: how likely is MICI to take hold in Antarctica and how fast could it progress? Right now, scientists can't answer this. They see some evidence for the process having occurred in the Earth's history; and think if it did happen, it's a possibility only under the most pessimistic warming futures. Dr Rob Larter, a marine geophysicist with the British Antarctic Survey, commented: ""With the present state of knowledge I agree with the description of runaway MICI as a low probability. However, I think it would be negligent to ignore it."" One final word. Don't lose sight of the sea-level rises that this report considers very likely. Remember, every additional centimetre increase in the height of the oceans puts more people at risk of coastal flooding. Valerie Masson-Delmotte, co-chair of the working group behind the IPCC report: Many of the changes set in motion by human-caused climate change are slow processes. These long lasting changes for the most part affect the planet's frozen regions and the oceans. Changes in ice sheets, deep ocean temperature and acidification will continue for centuries to thousands of years, meaning that they are irreversible in our lifetime and will continue for generations to come. The good news is that these irreversible changes can be slowed down with rapid, strong and sustained reductions in emissions.  Hoesung Lee, chairman of the IPCC: It is indisputable that human activities are causing climate change and making extreme weather events more frequent and severe. [The report] shows that climate change is affecting every region on our planet. It explains that strong, rapid, sustained reduction in carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions will be required to limit global warming.  Petteri Taalas, secretary-general of the World Meteorological Organization: Have we lost hope? No and yes. According to this report we still have a chance to stop the negative climate trend by the middle of this century by especially limiting the use of fossil fuels and by stopping deforestation... The report underlines the urgency to enhance the ambition level of climate mitigation.  Â© 2025 BBC.

"Gemma and Kate Fox welcomed their son Nye in May A same-sex couple who recently had their first child are calling for official forms to be more inclusive. Kate and Gemma Fox, from Exeter, have encountered numerous forms they cannot fill in because they only offer space for the names of a mother and a father. They include on Devon County Council's website, at their GP surgery and in the red book - the personal child health record given to all new parents. Since being contacted by the BBC, all three have said they will make changes. Kate Fox, a lecturer at Plymouth Marjon University, said: ""It's basically everywhere. ""I don't think we've come across a single thing so far that has not been super heteronormative."" Heteronormative is defined by Oxford English Dictionary,externalas designating, or based on a world view which regards gender roles as fixed to biological sex and heterosexuality as the normal and preferred sexual orientation. Devon County Council changed its online form after being contacted by the BBC and a spokesman said he was ""grateful to the couple for alerting us to this matter"" After their son Nye was born, the couple tried to make an appointment to register his birth using Devon County Council's website but could not. The council said the form had since been changed and other documentation checked to ensure this did not happen again. A spokesman said: ""We apologise profusely for this oversight and are grateful to the couple for alerting us to this matter."" The red book, which is given to all new parents, only has space for the name of a mother and a father The couple were also frustrated when they received their red book as it only offers space for the names of a mother and father. The Department for Health and Social Care said: ""The red book would be updated as part of our commitment to ensuring any disparities experienced by those in the wider LGBT community are acknowledged and their needs are considered throughout the health system."" The red book is currently being updated and digitised by the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health and the new version is due to be made available from 2023. Dr Fox said they took a sheet of paper to hospital with them explaining who they were to avoid having to deal with assumptions Dr Fox said: ""The attempt to have a child is often a battle for same-sex couples... and then when you've had a baby and it's super celebratory and then the first pieces of paper you are given say 'mother and father' and it's just, you're almost worn out by the time you have had a baby. ""We certainly were exhausted with the whole thing and then you think I just don't want every little piece of official paper to have to be a battle."" In July, the couple attempted to register Nye at their local GP surgery, St Thomas Health Centre in Exeter. The online form for registration only had boxes for mother and father and when they called to point this out, Dr Fox said they were told it could be sorted when they brought their son in. Kate Fox said the forms at her GP surgery do not represent all families Dr Fox said the paper form had the same wording and they were told to cross out father and write mother. She said more shockingly, they were handed another form to register a child at the surgery and that form asked for ethnicity but only offered white ethnicities as an option and under religion, only Christian religions. ""I think that's what we are saying... [is] if your form does not accept or represent our family then your form doesn't work,"" she said. ""It's not that we're being difficult it's that your form is wrong."" Kayleah Logan, co-founder of the Queer Parenting Partnership, said that every month they see couples expressing their ""upset at being invalidated as a parent"". ""It's not just representation, it's almost erasure of LGBT families,"" Ms Logan added. Nye, whose full name is Aneirin, was born in May Dr Alice Godwin, GP partner at St Thomas Medical Group, said the forms were a ""serious oversight"" and added: ""We wholeheartedly agree that official forms should be fully inclusive, and we are very sorry for the distress this caused to Kate and Gemma."" She said: ""The paper version of the form they were mistakenly given was an old version, which should have been destroyed when it was updated. ""We have made sure that no other copies remain and are reviewing all our documentation to make sure it is inclusive."" Dr Godwin said the online form had also been changed and added: ""We pride ourselves on being an open and inclusive practice and these mistakes are simply not acceptable."" Jo Turl, from NHS Devon Clinical Commissioning Group, said it would be contacting all GP practices in Devon to ask them to review their documentation. She said: ""Addressing inequalities is a priority for us so we take this matter very seriously."" Dr Fox called on anyone who wants to be an LGBT ally to take action by finding out what the forms at their surgery say. She added: ""Don't let it be the next same-sex couple or gender non-conforming person or whoever who comes into contact with these documents who has to be the one who has the fight."" A child can only have two legal parents but there is no limit to the number of people who can share parental responsibility Since 2009, same-sex female couples can include both their names on their child's birth certificate when registering the birth Male couples must get a parental order from the court before they can be registered as parents Source: www.gov.uk Follow BBC News South West onTwitter,external,Facebook,externalandInstagram,external.

"Are phone consultations here to stay? And is that a good thing? As Wales moves into alert level zero, legal limits on the numbers of people who can meet will be dropped. All businesses can reopen with risk assessments, although face masks in many indoor venues will remain. But what about GP surgeries? When the pandemic began, surgeries quickly put measures in place to prevent infections spreading among the most vulnerable - older people and those living with certain medical conditions. This meant initial phone consultations with face-to-face appointments when necessary, and GPs say they have never been busier. But some people told BBC News they were unhappy with this system. A man from Port Talbot said: ""If you are lucky enough to have the receptionist pick up the phone, you have to tell them what's wrong before they decide if it's an emergency or not. ""Then if you get past that stage you then get a call back from a doctor, who then decides if you need to actually be seen. Absolutely ridiculous."" One surgery asked patients not to criticise it on social media, but has since apologised He said the surgery had banned patients from criticising it on social media, threatening to remove them as a patient if they did. Requesting anonymity as a result, he said: ""There's a sign stating that anything negative said about the practice on social media etc, then that patient would be removed from there."" King's Surgery in Port Talbot apologised and said it would amend the notice immediately, but added: ""We are also aware of derogatory comments being left on some social media sites, and ask that wherever possible patients contact us directly if they are unhappy, so we can work with them to resolve the issues."" Swansea Bay health board said: ""We can give assurances that making a complaint or sharing poor experience should not lead to any patient being removed from a list. ""Only in extreme circumstances, where the complaints are targeted against individuals and unfounded, could this be seen as a breakdown in the patient-doctor relationship, and potential removal from the practice list."" It added that patient feedback was always welcome ""and we clearly recognise the role social media plays in this"" but asked people to be respectful and not write anything abusive about individual staff members.

""I think the perception is that GP surgeries are still in full lockdown mode, while the rest of Wales is opening up."" She added: ""I tried for 11 days to get through. One day was 162 calls another was 149 calls. ""It's not about me because I don't need to see a GP very often, but it just haunts me to think of frail, elderly or chronically sick people trying to navigate systems like this."" Meanwhile, a patient at a surgery in Cardiff said: ""They are a disgrace hiding away when so many have had to work alongside the public like supermarket people, yet they are paid less than GPs."" Others said they had no issue receiving medical attention throughout the pandemic, and preferred the flexibility of phone consultations. GPs said far from ""hiding away"" they were holding more consultations than ever, favouring the phone when clinically appropriate in order to protect vulnerable people - not themselves. They said such criticism was affecting morale. Some patients said they had trouble getting through to their GP surgery Gareth Thomas, business manager at West Quay Medical Centre in Barry, Vale of Glamorgan, said: ""We're all beginning to feel exhausted and fatigued when we see comments from a minority of patients which suggest we haven't been open, or comments we've had such as 'you lot should get back to work'. ""It's really disheartening that patients feel this way and perceive that we have all been work-shy throughout the pandemic which is absolutely not the case."" Mr Thomas said he had personally answered the phone to patients when demand was high, and worked during his annual leave to support staff. ""A lot of my staff including myself gave up a number of Saturdays to facilitate Covid vaccinations,"" he said. No, they have been open throughout. ""It is a complete misconception to suggest that surgeries have been closed,"" Phil White, chairman of the British Medical Association's GPs committee in Wales said. ""Appointments have always been honoured whether through video, telephone consultations or face-to-face where clinically necessary."" Mr Thomas added: ""Our doors are open and have always been throughout the pandemic. ""We cannot go back to pre-Covid times with lots of patients in one reception space and I am not sure this will ever return. ""What we've learnt is we really need to protect our elderly and vulnerable patients from illnesses such as influenza and Covid especially as we go into this winter."" ""Face-to-face consultations are gradually increasing,"" Dr White said. ""But with Covid measures in place including PPE and room cleaning, each face-to-face consultation can take twice as long and so offering a range of consultations can help us to try to meet the growing need for our services whilst keeping the most vulnerable safe. ""Some patients told us they prefer telephone consultations and in some cases the flexibility has enabled us to treat more patients and speak to those who felt nervous about entering the practice."" Mr Thomas added: ""GPs as much as patients would like to go back to all face-to-face appointments and have a personal connection again with all patients. ""Just like everyone we all want to get back to as normal as possible, but we are just not there yet."" Gareth Thomas says it is disheartening seeing comments claiming GP surgeries are ""shut"" A GP working in mid Wales, who did not wish to be named, said: ""It is about avoiding spending no longer than necessary physically in the practice. ""So yes in Covid times you cannot physically walk in and get an appointment, but you can phone, you can send an e-consult. ""Until all guidance regarding masks, social distancing and infection control are removed then we can't all just go back to normal, presuming that what you mean by normal is patients all sitting in a doctor's waiting room. ""By the nature of it, the patients who come into a GP practice are ill, vulnerable, frequently elderly... Is it right to expect them to all sit in a small room - as in normal pre-Covid times - especially when we know the Delta variant has much higher transmission rates?"" She said recruiting staff had been ""near impossible"", and with staff members having to self-isolate or shield the logistics of juggling staff rotas had been difficult. ""We do not have enough numbers on the ground to cover the workload. ""We have undertaken more consultations during the last 16 months than we ever have done, with limited staff and constantly changing guidance from the health board and Welsh government.

"The number of people waiting for heart surgery in England could rise by more than 40% by next spring, a charity has warned. The British Heart Foundation said more government money was needed - or it will take up to five years for cardiac services to return to pre-Covid levels. ""Even before the pandemic began, waiting lists for vital heart care were far too long,"" said the BHF. The government said it had invested Â£1bn this year to reduce waiting lists. The charity's warning about heart care comes just a dayafter new analysis suggested nearly 14 million peoplecould be on NHS waiting lists in England by next autumn. A backlog is predicted as patients who did not come forward during the pandemic now seek treatment and join waiting lists for routine operations. NHS waiting lists could hit 14m in England - report Heart disease: 'I fear being a forgotten casualty of pandemic' NHS uses AI scan to detect hidden heart disease The BHF said the number waiting for heart surgery - such as a heart bypass or transplant - in England is predicted to rise from 11,000 to more than 15,000 by February. The number waiting for more general heart care - for example diagnostic scans and treatment such as stents - could reach 500,000 by early 2024, it said. This would be double the levels seen before the pandemic in February 2020. The BHF said it had carried out modelling for its worst case scenario - and estimated that cardiology waiting lists might not return to early 2020 levels until the end of 2026.

""Delay in diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular diseases is not just about improving symptoms, however important that is - it is about saving lives,"" Prof Sir Nilesh Samani, medical director at the BHF, said. ""Tragically, we have already seen thousands of extra deaths from heart and circulatory diseases during the pandemic, and delays to care have likely contributed to this terrible toll."" The charity said it wanted to see an above-inflation rise in health spending and a plan to recruit more heart specialists. ""At this critical moment, the government must act now to avoid more lives lost to treatable heart conditions. Addressing the growing heart care backlog is only the start,"" said Prof Samani. ""We must also see a clear plan, alongside significant and ongoing investment, to build capacity back into the NHS and address the pandemic's impact on health workers. Getting this right would avoid preventable heartbreak for many families."" The government pointed to data from May this year that showed services were already recovering - and the number of new referrals for cardiology and cardiothoracic surgery had returned to similar levels seen prior to the pandemic. ""The NHS has faced huge challenges over the past year due to Covid-19 and we continue to support our incredible health and care staff who have kept services open for thousands of patients,"" a Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said. ""This includes dedicated investment of Â£1bn this year to tackle the backlog and reduce waiting lists.""

"This video can not be played Tokyo Olympics: Relive every Team GB gold medal at 2020 Games Team GB wasunofficially set a targetof between 45 and 70 medals by UK Sport, although the funding body's chief executive Sally Munday said it was taking a more ""holistic"" approach given the lack of competition for athletes during the Covid-19 pandemic. Britainfinished Tokyo 2020 with 65 medals,equalling their total as hosts in London nine years ago and making Tokyo their second-most successful overseas Olympics after Rio 2016. Team GB chef de mission Mark England called the medal haul as ""the greatest achievement in British Olympic history"". He said: ""Not only has the team made history but it has probably made history on the back of the most complex and most challenging and difficult environment that we will face certainly in my lifetime. ""It has been against all the odds and I think it is the greatest achievement in British Olympic history. It has been the miracle of Tokyo and it has been wonderful to be here."" Here we take a look at how each sport fared in Tokyo relative to its funding. The Sports Desk podcast: Has Biles changed the game on mental health? Tokyo 2020 medal table Funding amount:Â£1,122,879 Medals:0 Team GB have not won an Olympic medal in archery since 2004, and that run continued at Tokyo 2020. Archery was one of several sports to lose its funding after the Rio Games five years ago, before UK Sport U-turned in 2018 and decided to reinstate financial support. It has had its funding hugely increased for the Paris 2024 Olympic cycle, however, to more than Â£2.1m. Funding amount:Â£23,007,531 Medals:6 (3 silver, 3 bronze) Athletics funding was cut from Â£26,824,206 after the 2016 Games, at which GB won two golds, one silver and four bronzes. Keely Hodgkinson and Laura Muir both broke British records as they claimed silver in the women's 800m and 1500m respectively, while the quartet of CJ Ujah, Nethaneel Mitchell-Blake, Richard Kilty and Zharnel Hughes missed out on the 4x100m title by just a hundredth of a second. There were bronze medals for Josh Kerr in the men's 1500m, Holly Bradshaw in the women's pole vault, and in the women's 4x100m for Asha Philip, Imani-Lara Lansiquot, Dina Asher-Smith and Daryll Neita. The funding is set to be cut again, with the athletics squad receiving Â£22,175,520 for the next Olympic cycle. Funding amount:Â£946,779 Medals:0 Team GB's badminton squad were unable to bring home any medals from Tokyo, capping a difficult five years for the sport since Chris Langridge and Marcus Ellis' men's doubles bronze at Rio 2016. Badminton lost all its UK Sport funding after Rio despite that medal, before a 2018 reprieve. Its funding for the Paris 2024 cycle has been massively increased to Â£3.2m. A seven-strong squad competed in Tokyo, with Ellis and Lauren Smith reaching the quarter-finals of the mixed doubles and Toby Penty making the last 16 of the men's singles, showing promise for Paris in three years' time. This video can not be played GB's Lauren Price beats China's Li Qian to win gold in the women's middleweight boxing Funding amount:Â£12,084,436 Medals:6 (2 gold, 2 silver, 2 bronze) Tokyo 2020 is Britain's most successful Olympics in the boxing ring since 1920, with six medals. Lauren Price won middleweight gold, a day after Galal Yafai became Olympic flyweight champion. There were silver medals for Ben Whittaker (light-heavyweight) and Pat McCormack (welterweight), while Karriss Artingstall (featherweight) and team captain Frazer Clarke (super-heavyweight) claimed bronzes. The team doubled their medal total from Rio, despite a funding cut of Â£1,680,001. It is set to lose a further Â£688,929 before Paris. Funding amount:Â£16,344,693 Medals:2 (1 silver, 1 bronze) Liam Heath became Britain's most successful Olympic canoeist with K1 200m bronze - his fourth Olympic medal - while Mallory Franklin won women's canoe slalom silver. The total of two medals was half what the sport won at the London and Rio Games, and the fewest medals won since the Sydney 2000 Olympics. Canoeing faces a huge funding cut for the Paris 2024 cycle, however, from Â£16.3m to Â£12.2m - more than 25%. This video can not be played Tokyo Olympics: GB's Jason Kenny wins the men's keirin to claim his seventh Olympic gold Funding amount:Â£24,559,306 Medals:12 (6 gold, 4 silver, 2 bronze) Team GB's cycling team had their funding cut by a huge Â£5,708,510 before Tokyo, but still won an impressive 12 medals across track cycling, mountain biking and BMX. Tom Pidcock kicked things off with mountain bike cross-country gold, before Bethany Shriever won gold in the women's BMX racing final, moments after team-mate Kye Whyte claimed the nation's first Olympic medal in the event with silver in the men's. There was another gold for Charlotte Worthington in the BMX freestyle, where team-mate Declan Brooks took bronze in the men's event. In the velodrome, Great Britain won seven medals - more than any other nation in Tokyo. Jason Kenny won his seventh Olympic gold with a spectacular defence of his men's keirin title. Two days earlier, his wife Laura became the first British woman to win gold at three Olympic Games, winning the madison alongside Katie Archibald. It was an Olympic debut to remember for Matt Walls, who was crowned champion with a dominant performance in the omnium. There were silvers for GB in the men's team sprint, the men's madison and the women's team pursuit, while Jack Carlin won an impressive bronze medal in the men's individual sprint. Cycling will receive Â£3,042,378 more in funding for Paris 2024. This video can not be played Tokyo Olympics: Tom Daley and Matty Lee take diving gold - highlights Funding amount:Â£7,223,280 Medals:3 (1 gold, 2 bronze) Team GB had their diving funding cut from Â£7,467,860 to Â£7,223,280 for Tokyo, but won the same number of medals as five years ago. After winning one gold, one silver and one bronze in Rio, GB won a gold and two bronzes in Japan. Tom Daley ended his long wait for an Olympic title with a sublime display alongside Matty Lee in the men's synchronised 10m then went on to win bronze in the individual event. There was another medal on the men's 3m springboard, where Jack Laugher won bronze. Diving will receive Â£8,463,542 for Paris. Tears on the podium for a dream come true - the story of Tom Daley This video can not be played Tokyo Olympics: Ben Maher wins gold for Great Britain in individual jumping final Funding amount:Â£12,541,195 Medals:5 (2 gold, 1 silver, 2 bronze) Equestrian lost Â£5,451,405 in funding before Tokyo 2020, but the team delivered more medals than they did in Rio five years ago. Ben Maher won individual showjumping gold on Explosion W, after Oliver Townend, Laura Collett and Tom McEwen won team eventing gold. McEwen also won a silver in the individual event, and Charlotte Dujardin won her sixth Olympic medal with dressage bronze. A day earlier, Dujardin claimed bronze in the team dressage event alongside Carl Hester and Charlotte Fry. The equestrian team's funding will be reduced again for Paris, to Â£11,085,964. Funding amount:Â£13,408,688 Medals:3 (1 gold, 2 bronze) Team GB won seven gymnastics medals in Rio five years ago, but with a vastly different squad brought home only three from Tokyo. Max Whitlock and Bryony Page - the only members of the squad to compete in both Rio and Tokyo - were among the medals, Whitlock retaining his pommel horse title and Page winning bronze on the trampoline to add to the bronze the women's artistic gymnasts won in the team all-around competition. That bronze was GB's first medal in the women's team event for 93 years, while Whitlock's gold saw him become the most successful gymnast of all time on the pommel horse. Gymnastics will receive slightly less - Â£12.5m - for the Paris 2024 cycle. This video can not be played GB beat India in seven-goal thriller to win hockey bronze Funding amount:Â£12,905,612 Medals:1 (bronze) Great Britain's women's hockey team entered the Tokyo Games as defending Olympic champions, but the five years since Rio have been difficult with captain Hollie Pearne-Webb saying it had been far from a rollercoaster because ""there haven't been too many highs"". Just seven of the gold medal-winning squad from Rio competed in Tokyo, but they were able to put the difficulties of the last cycle behind them to win bronze - marking it the third Olympics in a row at which they have won a medal. ""For the girls it means a hell of a lot,"" said head coach Mark Hager. ""It's so rewarding for the group. Four months ago, if you asked me if we could get a medal I'd probably have said no. We had belief so it's very pleasing."" The men's team were knocked out in the quarter-finals. Funding amount:Â£6,564,334 Medals:1 (bronze) Chelsie Giles claimed Great Britain's first medal of the Tokyo Olympics with bronze in the women's -52kg event. Judo will lose Â£1,117,530 in funding for Paris. Funding amount:Â£5,498,321 Medals:2 (2 gold) Kate French's Olympic gold was Great Britain's first since Steph Cook's victory at Sydney 2000, with two silvers and a bronze won across the Athens, Beijing and London Games. Joe Choong added a second gold in the men's event after finishing 10th in Rio five years ago. Pentathlon GB faces a 20% cut to its funding for the Paris cycle. This video can not be played British Rowing performance director Brendan Purcell calls GB's performance 'heartbreaking' Funding amount:Â£24,655,408 Medals:2 (1 silver, 1 bronze) Rowing has historically been one of Team GB's most successful sports, and as such received the most funding for the Tokyo cycle, but took home just a silver and bronze from Japan. Their two medals - in the men's quadruple sculls and men's eight respectively - is the team's lowest haul since Atlanta 1996, and the first time GB has failed to win a gold medal since 1980. In December, it was announced rowing's funding had been reduced by about 10% to Â£22.2m for the Paris 2024 cycle. British Rowing performance director Brendan Purcell said GB's performance in Tokyo was ""heartbreaking"" and ""frustrating"" but added: ""We're really confident we're on the track to lift up and deliver in Paris."" Two medals, no gold - what has gone wrong with GB rowing? This video can not be played Team GB sailors Mills and McIntyre win 470 gold Funding amount:Â£22,249,000 Medals:5 (3 gold, 1 silver, 1 bronze) Sailing was one of the success stories for Team GB in Tokyo, as they finished as the top sailing nation for the fifth time in six Olympics. Hannah Mills became the most successful female Olympic sailor of all time with her 470 gold alongside Eilidh McIntyre, adding to Giles Scott's Finn gold, Dylan Fletcher and Stuart Bithell's 49er gold, John Gimson and Anna Burnet's Nacra 17 silver and Emma Wilson's windsurfing bronze. After winning his second successive Finn title, Scott said British sailing was ""in a good place"" but much will change going into Paris, with the Finn class being dropped and the 470 changing to a mixed event. Funding amount:Â£6,008,790 Medals:1 (bronze) Team GB had their shooting funding boosted from Â£3,950,888 to Â£6,008,790 for Tokyo 2020. Matthew Coward-Holley was going for gold, but had to settle for bronze in the men's trap shooting final. British medal hope Amber Hill, the world number one, withdrew from the women's skeet competition on the eve of the Olympics after testing positive for Covid-19. Funding is set to be reduced to Â£5,802,749 for Paris. Funding amount:Â£678,722 Medals:0 Shauna Coxsey was Team GB's sole hope as sport climbing made its Olympic debut but Coxsey, set to retire after the Games, failed to reach the women's final. Climbing is one of seven sports that will receive 'progression' funding during the Paris 2024 cycle, ""marking the start of a programme of support in the long-term medal potential"". It has been awarded Â£1,562,811. This video can not be played Adam Peaty: Team GB star wins 100m breaststroke gold at Tokyo Olympics Funding amount:Â£18,731,645 Medals:8 (4 gold, 3 silver, 1 bronze) British swimming's remarkable Tokyo 2020 campaign will not be forgotten in a hurry, such was the success in the pool. Eight medals, four of them gold, made it GB's greatest ever Olympic performance in the pool and the first time in 113 years that GB had won four swimming golds at one Games. It was kick-started by Adam Peaty winning the 100m breaststroke to become the first British swimmer to retain an Olympic title, before Duncan Scott claimed four medals - the most by a Briton at a single Games. ""I really do think this squad is going to go from strength to strength heading to Paris,"" said four-time Olympic medallist Rebecca Adlington. ""None of our top swimmers will be stopping and there are loads of talented female and male swimmers who aren't even in Tokyo who will be bursting through soon, so it's looking very bright for the future."" The lion king and the new generation - how GB swimmers roared their way to record success The wonder of Adam Peaty Funding amount:Â£8,223,805 Medals:3 (2 silver, 1 bronze) Britain's taekwondo hopes were dealt a blow early on when two-time defending champion Jade Jones suffered a shock defeat in the first round. But up stepped Bradly Sinden and Lauren Williams, who won silvers in their respective events, before Bianca Walkden added a second bronze medal to her collection. It meant GB Taekwondo equalled its record haul from Rio 2016, despite missing out on gold for the first time since 2008. This video can not be played Tokyo Olympics: Team GB win a gold medal in the triathlon mixed relay Funding amount:Â£7,049,372 Medals:3 (1 gold, 2 silver) British athletes are a common sight on the Olympic triathlon podium and Tokyo 2020 was no different, with three medals. Alex Yee kicked off the success, winning men's silver on his Olympic debut, before Georgia Taylor-Brown added another silver in the women's event. But better was to come as Yee and Taylor-Brown teamed up with Jonny Brownlee and Jess Learmonth to win gold in the mixed relay event, ensuring Brownlee would bid farewell to the Olympics with a complete set of medals. British Triathlon will receive a slight reduction in funding for Paris but with young athletes like Yee taking over the mantle from the Brownlees, the future looks bright.

Like sport climbing, skateboarding, basketball, fencing, surfing, table tennis and weightlifting will all receive 'progression' funding from UK Sport for the Paris cycle. In weightlifting, Emily Campbell became the first British woman to win an Olympic medal with her +87kg silver - Great Britain's first Olympic weightlifting medal since 1984.

"Athletes filled the stadium floor before the Olympic flame was extinguished The Tokyo Olympics, postponed and played out behind closed doors because of the Covid pandemic, concluded with an upbeat ceremony in Japan's capital. The Games took place without spectators and athletes were barred from venturing outside the Olympic village. Their staging has faced local opposition and around 30 protestors jostled with police at the National Stadium before the closing ceremony. However, other locals have braved heat and warnings to watch events from afar. The Sports Desk podcast: Has Biles changed the game on mental health? Fans took in outdoor events, such as triathlon and BMX, from overpasses and other vantage points despite temperatures that reached 35C, the hottest ever recorded at an Olympics. Barred from spectating in venues, some local fans found vantage points to take in events like the freestyle BMX The Games' official sign-off, featuring ska bands, football freestylers, breakdancers and BMX riders, created more made-for-TV memories, culminating in athletes thanking the people of Japan by making a heart gesture with their hands. A scaled-down parade of flagbearers, missing 62 of the competing nations, started proceedings in Tokyo before an air display team painted the French tricolore across the sky in Paris, the host city for 2024. Tokyo 2020 president Seiko Hashimoto, who appeared at seven Games as a speed skater and then a track cyclist, told the athletes: ""There are no words to describe what you have achieved. This video can not be played Relive some of the best bits from the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games ""You have accepted what seemed unimaginable, understood what had to be done, and through hard work and perseverance overcome unbelievable challenges."" She added: ""This has made you true Olympians."" Athletes had daily swabs to test for coronavirus and wore face masks when not eating, training or competing. After they had finished competing, they had 48 hours to leave the athletes' village. Simone Biles, who won three individual golds at Rio 2016, won bronze on the beam in Tokyo The Games were postponed a year from their original 2020 date and, as the global pandemic raged, Japanese support wavered, with unfavourable opinion polls in the months before and even the country's Emperor Naruhito expressing concerns about their staging. The banning of spectators from most venues denied the Japanese public a chance to watch a summer Games close up for the first time since Tokyo 1964 and the climax of an eight-year wait after winning the hosting rights in Buenos Aires in 2013.

Team GB athletes' results As ever, the Games produced a shower of stars. American swimmer Caeleb Dressel won five golds in the pool. Jamaican Elaine Thompson-Herah won another three on the track. Gymnast Daiki Hashimoto won two for the home nation in gymnastics. But, equally inevitably, there were moments that no-one could have expected.

Track cyclist Jason Kenny became the first Briton to win seven gold medals as he retained his keirin title, while Laura Kenny became the most successful female cyclist in history as she took her tally of golds to five with madison success alongside Katie Archibald. There were new stars as well. Twenty-one-year-old Tom Dean won a pair of golds in the pool, Bethany Shriever and Charlotte Worthington took BMX titles, and Keely Hodgkinson, 19, won a superb 800m silver on the track. Emily Campbell won Britain's first female weightlifting medal. Sky Brown became Britain's youngest ever summer Games medallist in one of the Games' newest sports with a skateboarding bronze.

"The UN has condemned the practice of child marriage Police in Zimbabwe are investigating the death of a 14-year-old girl during childbirth, a case that sparked outrage among citizens and rights activists. Memory Machaya is reported to have died last month at a church shrine in the eastern region of Marange. The case has exposed the exploitation of minors, as she was reportedly forced to abandon school to get married. The United Nations urged the government to recognise child marriage as a crime and bring an end to the practice. The organisation said it ""notes with deep concern"" and ""condemns strongly"" reports into the circumstances surrounding the death. ""The current trend of unresolved cases of violence against women and girls in Zimbabwe, including marriages of minors, cannot continue with impunity,"" the UN said in a statement on Saturday. The girl's death on 15 July has put the spotlight on the practice of child marriage within Zimbabwe's Apostolic Church, which often rejects medicine and hospital treatment. Her family has said that the baby survived the birth and was doing well, local media report. The circumstances that led to the death and subsequent burial are under investigation by the police and the country's state gender commission. An online petition calling for ""justice for Memory Machaya"" has so far received more than 57,000 signatures. Zimbabwean feminist activist Everjoice Win said it wastime for people to pressure those ""with the power to uphold the law, or make new laws"",external.

"The number of people waiting for heart surgery in England could rise by more than 40% by next spring, a charity has warned. The British Heart Foundation said more government money was needed - or it will take up to five years for cardiac services to return to pre-Covid levels. ""Even before the pandemic began, waiting lists for vital heart care were far too long,"" said the BHF. The government said it had invested Â£1bn this year to reduce waiting lists. The charity's warning about heart care comes just a dayafter new analysis suggested nearly 14 million peoplecould be on NHS waiting lists in England by next autumn. A backlog is predicted as patients who did not come forward during the pandemic now seek treatment and join waiting lists for routine operations. NHS waiting lists could hit 14m in England - report Heart disease: 'I fear being a forgotten casualty of pandemic' NHS uses AI scan to detect hidden heart disease The BHF said the number waiting for heart surgery - such as a heart bypass or transplant - in England is predicted to rise from 11,000 to more than 15,000 by February. The number waiting for more general heart care - for example diagnostic scans and treatment such as stents - could reach 500,000 by early 2024, it said. This would be double the levels seen before the pandemic in February 2020. The BHF said it had carried out modelling for its worst case scenario - and estimated that cardiology waiting lists might not return to early 2020 levels until the end of 2026. This video can not be played Linda Murray's surgery has been rescheduled multiple times Around 7.6 million people live with heart and circulatory diseases in the UK, the BHF said. ""Delay in diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular diseases is not just about improving symptoms, however important that is - it is about saving lives,"" Prof Sir Nilesh Samani, medical director at the BHF, said. ""Tragically, we have already seen thousands of extra deaths from heart and circulatory diseases during the pandemic, and delays to care have likely contributed to this terrible toll."" The charity said it wanted to see an above-inflation rise in health spending and a plan to recruit more heart specialists. ""At this critical moment, the government must act now to avoid more lives lost to treatable heart conditions. Addressing the growing heart care backlog is only the start,"" said Prof Samani. ""We must also see a clear plan, alongside significant and ongoing investment, to build capacity back into the NHS and address the pandemic's impact on health workers. Getting this right would avoid preventable heartbreak for many families."" The government pointed to data from May this year that showed services were already recovering - and the number of new referrals for cardiology and cardiothoracic surgery had returned to similar levels seen prior to the pandemic. ""The NHS has faced huge challenges over the past year due to Covid-19 and we continue to support our incredible health and care staff who have kept services open for thousands of patients,"" a Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said.

"It was all smiles in Paris in 2015 but have countries fulfilled their climate promises? Agreed by 196 parties in the French capital in December 2015, the Paris climate deal aims to keep the rise in global temperatures this century ""well below 2C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5C."" We look at five key countries and how well they have kept their promises. Every one of the signatories to the Paris climate agreement has had to lodge a climate action plan with the UN to spell out what steps they are taking to curb carbon. Overall, according to a new assessment from global consultancy Systemiq, low-carbon solutions have been more successful in this period than many people realise. The growth in coal for energy outside of China has declined significantly. ""We have to translate what we can do into what we will do,"" said Lord Nicholas Stern, from the London School of Economics (LSE). ""But a big part of that is understanding what is happening and that's why I think this report is important. It will change people's perspectives of what is possible and translate that into action."" So the big picture might be improving, but what about individual nations? We looked at how five key countries have lived up to their promises under the pact. As well as being the world's fifth largest economy, the UK is the incoming president of the Conference of the Parties or COP, the main UN climate negotiating forum, which will take place in Glasgow in November 2021. This global gathering of world leaders will try and work out how to improve the collective effort to tackle climate change, and take the next steps.  COP26 in Glasgow will be the most important meeting since the Paris climate agreement was signed five years ago. The president of the meeting is a key influence on the success or failure of the event. Expanding offshore wind energy is a key policy for the UK's future climate targets In Paris in 2015, French foreign minister Laurent Fabius was seen as ahugely effective, impartial leaderwho gained the trust of nations rich and poor. UK Business Secretary Alok Sharma has already been tasked with the job by Boris Johnson, but alreadythere are worries that he has too much on his plate. Has the UK lived up to its promises? The answer to this is mostly yes. Since 2008, the UK government has had to set five-year greenhouse gas targets by law, based on advice from the independent Climate Change Committee (CCC). Targets set under the first three carbon budgets have been met. While it was part of the EU, the UK's target for 2020 was a reduction of 16% on 2005 emissions. The UK easily achieved this. In fact, right now, Britain's total output of warming gases has gone down by around 45% from 1990 levels. As a result of leaving the EU, the UK has to register its own standalone plan to cut carbon with the UN. This is known as a ""nationally determined contribution"" or NDC. It focuses on targets for 2030, which are meant to show the pathway to net zero emissions by 2050. Reaching net zero requires that any carbon emissions are balanced by absorbing an equivalent amount from the atmosphere by, for example, planting trees. Thenew 2030 plan, released on 3 December, won plaudits for its ambition. But critics said there were major hurdles ahead. Under the NDC, around 87% of UK electricity would need to come from low carbon sources by the end of this decade, up from over 50% now. Almost half the cars on the road would need to be electric, up from around 6% at present. As well as making major changes to transport, energy and food emissions, the UK will have to take a tough stand internationally so that it doesn't simply substitute carbon cuts at home with emissions-laden products from abroad. ""It's what you do at home, but it's also what you invest in internationally,"" Dr Alison Doig, from theEnergy and Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU),external, told BBC News. ""The UK needs to ensure with our export finance credits and with our Brexit deals, that we are strongly signalling overseas, what we're doing domestically."" Nevertheless, in April 2021, the government announced that it would speed up its emissions-cutting plan. Boris Johnson said carbon releases would be reduced by 78% by 2035 - taking the country more than three quarters of the way to net zero. Australia matters because not only is it one of the biggest sources of fossil fuels, it is also a country highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. The nation is now the world's largest exporter of coal and gas, according to arecent study,external. Wildfires in Australia were made worse by long running drought Emissions of greenhouse gases from Australian exports are responsible for 3.6% of global emissionsaccording to research,external. On a per capita basis, and including exports, Australians are responsible for four times as much CO2 as people living in the US. Politically, Australia is also very important in climate change terms as well. Over the past five years, it has moved further away from the majority of nations in the UN, which have been urging rapid cuts in carbon. Prime minister Scott Morrison wascriticised by other politiciansfor downplaying the role of climate change after recent, devastating wildfires. Has Australia lived up to its promises? Not really. While it is set to hit a rather low 2020 target set under a previous global agreement, its actions under the Paris climate agreement are not measuring up, according to experts. Australia's Prime Minister Scott Morrison has been criticised for not not taking climate change seriously Australia set a target for 2030 of making a 26-28% reduction in its emissions compared with 2005 levels. Projections published at the end of 2019 suggested Australian emissions will be only 16% lower than 2005 levels in 2030. This year's UN Emissions Gap report says that, right now Australia is projected to fall short on what should be a very easy target. ""That 26% reduction needs to be at least double that to be in the Paris Agreement pathway,"" says Dr Bill Hare, who's part of theClimate Action Tracker,externalgroup of scientists who have rated Australia's plans as ""insufficient"". ""There's very little going on whether you're talking about electric vehicles, motor vehicle standards, it's alone in the OECD in not having fuel efficiency standards, it has virtually nothing on energy efficiency, and virtually nothing on building efficiency."" ""It is really an embarrassment actually."" There's a lot of focus on Australia now because of changing world politics. A dispute with China has threatened its exports of coal, while the result of the recent US election has taken away a climate ally of the Australian government. There's even been some talk in recent weeks that the country might soon set a long-term net-zero emissions goal. Andaccording to newspaper reports,external, Australia's Prime Minister Scott Morrison is set to announce that the country will no longer use carbon credits carried over from a previous international climate agreement. Australia had planned to use these questionable credits as a way of making up the shortfall in its 2030 target. ""I think if Trump had won the election then Australia would see themselves as part of a gang with Brazil and Saudi Arabia and a few others,"" said Dr Alison Doig, from the ECIU. But with the dawn of the Biden era, ""they know are in a position that's becoming more outcast. So that might be why there's some softening on local language and the rhetoric"". While action at the federal level in Australia might be slow, lower down there's a good deal of movement. ""Our energy market operator has said that for the power sector in Australia, we're looking at the fastest transition in the world,"" said Dr Bill Hare. ""Everyone knows that we're famous for our sunshine, our wind and our space. And that means that renewables are cheap, they are rapidly outcompeting coal and gas, and those technologies are going to be replaced very quickly."" The EU represents about a fifth of the world's economy - andwas responsible for around 9% of the global share of CO2 emissions in 2019,,externalthe third largest emitter. Climate change is seen as a key issue for Europe, because it's an international problem where acting together makes sense to many citizens. Europe's political leaders also see tackling climate as important in showing the global relevance of the Union. An onshore wind farm in Germany During the Trump administration, the EU stepped into a leadership role, attempting to build bridges with China on how to tackle the challenge. The EU is well-regarded generally among developing countries and small island states because they are seen as wanting to push for greater ambition in terms of cutting carbon. In terms of building a global alliance of rich and poor countries the EU is key. Has the EU lived up to its targets? Mostly, yes. But back in 2007, EU leaders set a goal of cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 20% of their 1990 levels by 2020. By 2018, the collective efforts had cut warming gases by 23.2%. This over-achievement caused many to think that the initial targets had been set far too low. The EU subsequently announced a target of 40% for 2030, but this too came to be viewed as too easy to meet. The bloc has now adopted the aim of having a carbon-neutral economy by 2050, in line with the Paris Agreement. And in theEuropean Green Deal,external, announced in September 2020, the European Commission proposed a new target for cuts of around 55% by 2030. In April 2021, ahead of President Biden's climate leaders' summit, the EU adopted the goal. The European Parliament and many environmentalists had wanted them to go further and aim for a 60% cut. But the proposal ran into trouble with Eastern European member states who argued this was too much, too soon. China is key to solving the global problem with climate change, because it is the world's biggest contributor to the root cause, CO2 emissions. As China's economy rapidly expanded over the past two decades, using coal as their main energy source, their emissions have overtaken the US and now comprise around 28% of the global CO2 output. But China is also the reason for a recent burst of optimism that has spread through the international community since September, when China's President Xi Jinpingtold the UNthat his country would reach carbon neutrality by 2060. China's President Xi meets US President Trump in 2019 Has China lived up to its promises? The answer is mostly, yes, but with some caveats. Seeing itself as a developing country, China has always been reluctant to take on targets to cut carbon, arguing that the West should go first and farthest to rein in CO2. Instead, China has focussed on carbon intensity rather than cuts. This means limiting the amount of CO2 used per unit of economic activity. This is easier to achieve than outright emissions reductions but the downside is that as GDP increases so does the overall total of carbon used. Before the Copenhagen conference of the parties meeting (COP) in 2009, China pledged to cut its carbon intensity by 40-45%, compared to 2005 levels. At the end of 2017, China had cut carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP by 46% from the 2005 level. In the Paris Agreement, China promised to cut carbon intensity by 60-65%, and to peak its emissions by 2030. The country remains on course to meet these goals. In fact,according to some research,external, it could meet them years ahead of schedule. ""I think China took the conservative approach to the Paris Agreement, they only proposed something that they were very sure that they could meet,"" says Niklas HÃ¶hne from the Climate Action Tracker. ""It was also clear that at, the moment when they proposed their 2030 target, that they would over-achieve it. And that doesn't mean that that it's a bad target, per se, but that's their way of approaching it."" When President Xi Jinping told the UN in September that China would reach net-zero in 2060 and peak its emissions well before 2030, the statement was welcomed all over the world. But observers said targets contained in the country's five-year plan, released in March 2021, could lead to emissions continuing to increase. A giant solar farm in China A new Chinese national commitment is to be submitted to the UN in the run up to the Glasgow COP26 meeting. But there are significant challenges. ""The nature of the peaking in the 2030 target can be only measured in a 100% certain way after the fact,"" said Dr Shuwei Zhang, from the Draworld Environment Research Centre in Beijing. ""The 2060 neutrality goal is theoretically possible, but could become unfeasible in reality, if action is continuously delayed."" ""From now, there is no leeway to accommodate coal any longer."" Scientists examine a melting glacier in China China will have to limit coal for energy, not just inside the country but outside as well. The financing of overseas coal power plants will have to wind down. Right now, the country'semissions have rebounded,externalin the wake of the pandemic, as coal continues to burn brightly. But many remain optimistic that, if China says it can do something, then it will get there. The Philippines is one of the countries suffering the most fromthe impacts of climate change. The Philippines has suffered serious impacts from storms and typhoons Like many other developing economies, the country is very keen to use energy to bring people out of poverty and raise living standards. In the past, the Philippines has looked to significantly increase investment in coal to foster development. But its current approach seeks to move away from coal, and experts say the country could be a role model for many developing nations in similar situations. Has the Philippines lived up to its promises? Up until the Paris Agreement, the Philippines had not had any international requirements to curb its carbon. But in the Paris pact, it committed to cut its emissions by 70% below ""business as usual"" by 2030.  According to the Climate Action Tracker analysis, its actions to date are compatible with keeping warming well below 2C this century. In 2019, around half the country's electricity came from coal - and plans in the pipeline would have more than doubled the country's coal fired capacity. But in October 2020,the government announced a moratorium on new coal plants,external, preferring instead to pursue a more mixed energy strategy. According to the Climate Action Tracker, this could curb emissions from the Philippines by 35% on top of their current policy projections by 2030. ""I think that one of the most critical factors is that the market has been very important in the power sector,"" said Dr Bill Hare. ""In other countries in Southeast Asia, we have what's called political economy, vested interests dominate in places such as Vietnam or Indonesia."" ""But in the Philippines, the market has been really important in determining investments for quite some time. And I think that's what we're seeing unfolding, multiplied by a government predisposition now towards renewables, and a realisation that, as a very vulnerable country, they really need to be getting their act together."" The expectation of observers is that with funding from the UN'sGreen Climate Fund,externaland more focus on sustainability from international banks, the move away from fossil fuels in the Philippines in the longer term will likely speed up. The Philippines has not yet set a long-term goal, but it says it is committed to submitting a new national climate plan with enhanced targets. The country will also likely push for further action on a concept known as ""loss and damage"" within the UN negotiation process. For developing nations, this means financial recompense for the impacts of climate change that cannot be avoided or adapted to. But richer countries are strongly resistant, believing that because they contributed the most to carbon emissions, they will be on the hook for compensation for centuries to come.

"Wildfires have been burning in Greece in recent days The world's largest ever report into climate change will be published later, setting out the stark reality of the state of the planet. The study is by theIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change,external- a UN group that looked at more than 14,000 scientific papers. It will be the most up-to-date assessment of how global warming will change the world in the coming decades. Scientists say it will likely be bad news - but with ""nuggets of optimism"". And environmental experts have said it will be a ""massive wake-up call"" to governments to cut emissions. Have countries kept their climate change promises? A really simple guide to climate change Why China's climate policy matters to us all The last time the IPCC looked at the science of global warming was in 2013 - and scientists believe they have learnt a lot since then. In recent years, the world has seen record-breaking temperatures, raging wildfires and devastating flooding. Some papers studied by the panel show that some of the changes humans are inadvertently making to the climate will not be reversed for hundreds or maybe thousands of years. The IPCC's findings - which will be revealed at a press conference at 09:00 BST - will also be used during a major summit hosted by the UK in November. The summit, COP26, which is run by the UN, is seen as a critical moment if climate change is going to be brought under control. Leaders from 196 countries will meet to try and agree action. Alok Sharma, the UK minister who is leading the summit,said at the weekend that theworld was almost running out of time to avoid catastrophe - and the effects of climate change were already happening. The intergovernmental panel brings together representatives of world governments who appraise research by scientists. That means all governments buy into the findings. The last panel was in 2013 and researchers say much has firmed up since then. Previously, for instance, they were reluctant to ascribe extreme events such as heatwaves and torrential rain to being at least partly down to climate change. Now in the case of theheatdome in the USin June, they're confident to say it would have been almost impossible without climate change. They say the world will continue to get hotter. It will also - especially in northern Europe - get wetter, though droughts will increase too as weather patterns shifts. The panel studied papers showing that sea level would continue to rise for hundreds or possibly thousands of years because of heat already trapped in the ocean deep. Research does confirm though, that if politicians can stick to holding global temperature increase down to 1.5C, on pre-industrial times, the worst catastrophes can still be avoided. Prof Piers Forster, an expert in climate change from the University of Leeds, said the report ""will be able to say a whole lot more about the extremes we are experiencing today and it will be able to be categoric that our emissions of greenhouse gases are causing them and they are also going to get worse"". ""The report will come with quite a lot of bad news about where we are and where we're going, but there are going to be nuggets of optimism in there which I think are really good for the climate change negotiations,"" he told LBC. One of the causes for optimism he mentioned was that there is still a chance of keeping global warming to below 1.5 degrees. Experts say the impacts of climate change are far more severe when the increase is greater than 1.5C. So far,global temperatures have climbedto 1.2C above pre-industrial levels. The Paris climate agreement in 2015 established the goal of keeping the increase in the global average temperature to no more than 2C and to try not to surpass 1.5C. Poor countries struggle to cope with climate impact Greece wildfires continue to threaten villages Richard Black, from non-profit advisory group the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, said: ""Coming just before COP26, this report is a massive wake-up call to all those governments that have not yet put forward realistic plans to cut emissions over the next decade. ""It will show that choices made now have a big effect on our future - leading to a runaway world of wild weather impacts and incalculable risks at one end, and at the other a future where climate change is constrained within manageable bounds."" According to many observers, there have been significant improvements in the science in the last few years. ""Our models have gotten better, we have a better understanding of the physics and the chemistry and the biology, and so they're able to simulate and project future temperature changes and precipitation changes much better than they were,"" said Dr Stephen Cornelius from WWF, an observer at IPCC meetings. ""Another change has been that attribution sciences have increased vastly in the last few years. We can make greater links between climate change and extreme weather events."" As well as updates on temperature projections, there will likely be a strong focus on the question of humanity's role in creating the climate crisis. In the last report in 2013, the IPCC said thathumans were the ""dominant cause"" of global warming since the 1950s. The message in the latest report is expected to be even stronger, with warnings of how soon global temperatures could rise 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. Experts say the impacts of climate change are far more severe when the increase is greater than 1.5C. This video can not be played Climate change: How 1.5C could change the world It is expected that this time the IPCC will also outline just how much of an influence humans are having on the oceans, the atmosphere and other aspects of our planetary systems. One of the most important questions concerns sea-level rise. This has long been a controversial issue for the IPCC, with their previous projections scorned by some scientists as far too conservative. ""In the past they have been so reluctant to give a plausible upper limit on sea-level rise, and we hope that they finally come around this time,"" said Prof Arthur Petersen, from UCL in London. As the world has experienced a series of devastating fires and floods in recent months that have been linked to climate change, the report will also include a new chapter linking extreme weather events to rising temperatures. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is a UN body set up in 1988 to assess the science around climate change. The IPCC provides governments with scientific information they can use to develop policies on global heating. The first of its comprehensive Assessment Reports on climate change was released in 1992. The sixth in this series will be split into four volumes, the first of which - covering the physical science behind climate change - will be published on Monday. Further parts of the review will cover impacts and solutions. A summary has been approved in a process involving scientists and representatives of 195 governments.

"A new global agreement - the Glasgow Climate Pact - was reached at the COP26 summit. It aims to reduce the worst impacts of climate change - but some leaders and campaigners say it does not go far enough. The agreement - although not legally binding - will set the global agenda on climate change for the next decade: Emissions It was agreed countries will meet next year to pledge further cuts to emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) - agreenhouse gas which causes climate change. This is to try to keep temperature rises within 1.5C - which scientists say is required to prevent a ""climate catastrophe"". Current pledges, if met, will only limit global warming to about 2.4C. Coal For the first time at a COP conference, there was an explicit plan to reduce use of coal - which is responsible for 40% of annual CO2 emissions. However, countries only agreed a weaker commitment to ""phase down"" rather than ""phase out"" coal after a late intervention by China and India. PM: Climate deal sounds death knell for coal power Evasive words and coal compromise, but deal shows progress Developing countries The agreement pledged to significantly increase money to help poor countries cope with the effects of climate change and make the switch to clean energy. There's also the prospect of a trillion dollar a year fund from 2025 - after a previous pledge for richer countries to provide $100bn (Â£72bn) a year by 2020 was missed. While some observers say the COP26 agreement represented the ""start of a breakthrough"", some African and Latin American countries felt not enough progress was made. Why hasn't climate pledge to poor countries been met? Fossil fuel subsidies World leaders agreed to phase-out subsidies that artificially lower the price of coal, oil, or natural gas. However, no firm dates have been set. How much is still spent supporting oil, coal and gas? A flurry of other announcements were made: The world's biggest CO2 emitters, the US and China,pledged to cooperate more over the next decadein areas including methane emissions and the switch to clean energy. China has previously been reluctant to tackle domestic coal emissions - so this was seen as recognising the need for urgent action. Cautious welcome for US-China climate agreement Why China's climate policy matters to us all Leaders from more than 100 countries - with about 85% of the world's forests -promised to stop deforestationby 2030. This is seen as vital, as trees absorb vast amounts of CO2. Similar initiativeshaven't stopped deforestation, but this one's better funded. However, it's unclear how the pledge will be policed. Ascheme to cut 30% of methane emissions by 2030was agreed by more than 100 countries. Methane is currently responsible for a third of human-generated warming. The big emitters China, Russia and India haven't joined - but it's hoped they will later. Financial organisations controlling $130tnagreed to back ""clean"" technology, such as renewable energy, and direct finance away from fossil fuel-burning industries. The initiative is an attempt to involve private companies in meeting net zero targets. However, some environmental organisations have said without a greater commitment to ending support for fossil-fuels, this could be little more than a PR exercise. Most commitments made at COP will have to be self-policed. Only a few countries are making their pledges legally binding. COP26 was the moment countries revisited climate pledges made made under the 2015Paris Agreement. Six years ago, countries were asked to make changes to keep global warming ""well below"" 2C - and to try to aim for 1.5C. COP stands for ""Conference of the Parties"", and the one in Glasgow was the 26th annual summit. Ahead of it, 200 countries were asked for their plans to cut emissions by 2030. The goal is to keep cutting emissions until they reachnet zeroby mid-century. Next year's COP27 summit is in Egypt. Simple guide to climate change What will climate change look like for you?

"Afghan security forces have faced a major blow with the loss of Kunduz The Taliban have captured three regional capitals in Afghanistan as they continue to make sweeping territorial gains in the country. They seized control of the key northern city of Kunduz on Sunday, as well as Sar-e-Pul and Taloqan. It means five regional capitals have fallen to the militants since Friday, with Kunduz being their most important gain this year. The Taliban said there is no agreement on a ceasefire with the government. A spokesman for the group warned against further US intervention in Afghanistan while speaking to Al Jazeera TV on Sunday. Violence has escalated across Afghanistan after US and other international forces began to withdraw their troops from the country, following 20 years of military operations. Taliban militants have made rapid advances in recent weeks. Having captured large swathes of the countryside, they are now targeting key towns and cities. The three northern cities fell to Taliban control within hours of each other on Sunday, with one resident in Kunduz describing the situation as ""total chaos"". The Afghan government, meanwhile, said its forces were fighting to retake key installations. Heavy fighting has also been reported in Herat in the west, and in the southern cities of Kandahar and Lashkar Gah. Thousands of civilians have been displaced this year. Families, including babies and young children, have been sheltering in a school in the north-eastern city of Asadabad. ""Many bombs were dropped on our village. The Taliban came and destroyed everything. We were helpless and had to leave our houses. Our children and ourselves are sleeping on the ground in dire conditions"", Gul Naaz told AFP. ""There was firing, one of my seven-year-old daughters went out during that fighting and disappeared. I don't know if she is alive or dead,"" another displaced resident said. Displaced children take refuge at a school in Asadabad, Kunar province near the Pakistan border The US has intensified its air strikes on Taliban positions, with Afghan military officials saying militants have been killed. But the Taliban say the air strikes hit two hospitals and a school in the city of Lashkar Gah. Neither claim has been independently verified. The US embassy in Afghanistan condemned the Taliban's ""violent new offensive against Afghan cities"", saying the group's actions to ""forcibly impose its rule are unacceptable"". ""They demonstrate wanton disregard for the welfare and rights of civilians and will worsen this country's humanitarian crisis,"" it said in a statement. By Khalil Noori, BBC News, Kabul This attack on a number of strategic cities and their fall to the Taliban was unprecedented. But as the deadline for the full withdrawal of foreign forces approached, a big change on the battlefield was expected. Now it is time for the Afghan government to prove that its well-equipped forces, 350,000 strong, are able to retake the lost areas. It would be difficult for the Taliban to hold Kunduz, but for several weeks the group has kept control of commercial centres important for trade with Iran and Pakistan. The populations in cities taken by the Taliban are paying the price of war, having lost loved ones or property. They are having to leave their homes, fearing the launch of a government operation to retake the cities. Peace talks with the Taliban in Doha are deadlocked. If the process resumes, from now on both sides will be trying to control the larger area to justify a greater share of power, if they agree on a transitional government. The seizure of Kunduz is the most significant gain for the Taliban since they launched their offensive in May. The city, home to 270,000 people, is considered a gateway to the country's mineral-rich northern provinces. And its location makes it strategically important as there are highways connecting Kunduz to other major cities, including Kabul, and the province shares a border with Tajikistan. PROFILE:Who are the Taliban? ANALYSIS:How the Taliban retook half of Afghanistan FROM THE ARCHIVE:Kunduz, the city the Taliban seized That border is used for the smuggling of Afghan opium and heroin to Central Asia, which then finds its way to Europe. Controlling Kunduz means controlling one of the most important drug smuggling routes in the region. It also holds symbolic significance for the Taliban because it was a key northern stronghold before 2001. The militants captured the city in 2015 and again in 2016 but have never been able to hold it for long. This video can not be played The BBC's Yogita Limaye travelled to Afghanistan's Kunduz province, most of which has fallen to the Taliban By Paul Adams, BBC Diplomatic Correspondent Former British Gen Sir Richard Barrons says there is a danger of Afghanistan feeling ""friendless"", in the wake of recent battlefield defeats and the possible withdrawal of diplomats and contractors from Kabul if things get worse. It is much too early to speculate about a Saigon-style withdrawal from the capital, echoing the way the Americans hastily left Vietnam in the final act of the war there, in 1975. But in recent days, British and American calls for their nationals to leave the country threaten to create a dangerous narrative. It is something that western military planners have been worried about for some time, following US President Joe Biden's decision, in April, to withdraw American forces by 11 September. In June, classified UK Ministry of Defence documents were found at a Canterbury bus stop by a member of the public. One of them voiced just this concern, speaking about the need to counter an ""abandonment narrative"" in Afghanistan. ""Precise language may be needed,"" it said, ""to avoid misunderstandings about 'retrograde to zero' vs normal diplomatic (including military) representation."" ""Retrograde to zero"" is the peculiar euphemism used to describe the withdrawal process now in its final weeks. In other words, planners were only too aware of creating the dangerous impression that Afghanistan might indeed be left ""friendless"". That is not yet the case. American air strikes are still being used in an attempt to halt the Taliban's advances. Britain and the US will doubtless have hidden assets on the ground, working feverishly to stem the tide of the war. Who are the Taliban?
