"Travel insurance policies that offer ""complete"" cover for Covid-related disruption are barely available, according to consumer group Which?. It analysed 263 different policies and found only two gave travellers all-round financial protection. As a result, it called into question various providers' claims that their policies provided Covid cover. An industry body said holidaymakers needed to be clear about what their insurance products provided. Insurance brokers have stressed that they can search the market for specific needs if people still wish to travel despite the current restrictions. The analysis by Which? found two policies - from HSBC and Barclays - offered widespread protection, but were only available to those banks' customers and could only be bought alongside other insurance products. They protected policyholders against cancellation due to changes in advice from the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) or government lockdowns prohibiting travel. They also covered testing positive for Covid-19 or being told to self-isolate, and medical costs and repatriation. While some travel insurers boasted of offering ""Covid cover"", many policies excluded plausible and potentially costly scenarios, such as new lockdowns in the UK or destination country, the consumer group said. Can we get our money back if we can't go on holiday? Scramble to return as Portugal joins amber list Every policy analysed offered cover for medical and repatriation costs for travellers catching Covid while travelling. However, no more than a third offered cover if travellers cancelled after being notified to isolate by the test and trace app, and only 3% protected against failing to travel owing to a need to quarantine on return - a scenario possible if their destination was re-graded on the traffic light system. Gareth Shaw, head of Which?Â Money, said: ""As the removal of Portugal from the green list shows, last-minute disruption to holiday plans can happen - and our research shows that many travel insurers don't offer much protection if it does. ""The government should work with regulators to ensure that travellers, should they choose to go abroad, are given clear information about what they will and won't be covered for."" A spokesman for the Association of British Insurers said: ""We urge people to read their policy to understand the scope of cover, as policies bought after the pandemic was declared are unlikely to cover cancellation due to Covid as it is a known risk, and travel insurance is designed and priced to cover unforeseen events. ""Travellers should always be aware of and follow government advice, and the border requirements of the country they are visiting. And always follow FCDO advice, to avoid invalidating your travel insurance.""

"JD Sports executive chairman Peter Cowgill The chairman of JD Sports has rejected criticism of a large bonus he received after the retailer benefited from millions of pounds in Covid support. Peter Cowgill told the BBC that the ""lion's share"" of the Â£4.3m bonus related to work done pre-January 2019. He also rejected suggestions the firm should repay furlough money. Shareholder advisory group Glass Lewis has urged investors in the sportswear chain to vote against what it calls an ""inappropriate"" pay policy. Shareholders will get a chance to vote at JD Sports' annual general meeting on 1 July, although this would not be binding. Mr Cowgill told the BBC's World at One programme that the pay boost in 2020 resulted from a long-term incentive share plan (Ltip), and that he had received only one payout from the scheme in the past eight years. ""Over that period the [firm's] profits went from Â£82m to Â£420m,"" he added. Mr Cowgill said the firm had correctly used the furlough scheme to support jobs, and should not volunteer to pay it back as rivals Primark and Asos have done. He said Primark was part of a larger firm, AB Foods, whose profits benefited from strong sales of food last year, while Asos was a pure online player which did not have the same overheads. JD Sports faces backlash over boss's Â£4.3m bonus Mr Cowgill said it was possible investors might vote against his pay package, but added: ""Why would you when the company has progressed, it's provided increasing levels of employment throughout? ""It's expanded internationally, it's created continued growth."" As a non-essential retailer, JD Sports' shops were closed for long periods during the pandemic and the firm received Â£61m through the UK furlough scheme and an estimated Â£38m in business rates relief. It has also benefitted from an additional Â£25m in wage support from other countries where it operates. JD Sports was also provisionally granted an emergency Â£300m loan from the Bank of England, although the company points out that it was, in the end, not needed and never accessed. At the same time, the chain saw its revenues rise in 0.9% last year to Â£6.1bn as its sales shifted online, although its pre-tax profits fell 7%. Mr Cowgill's bonus was agreed in January 2019 and several instalments were deferred due to the pandemic, then subsequently paid. Taking this into account, he said his bonus last year was actually Â£1.3m - down 75% on the previous year.

"US model and author Chrissy Teigen has 35 million followers on Instagram Chrissy Teigen has broken a month-long social media silence to apologise for bullying several people on Twitter. In a blog post, the US model reflected on ""the crushing weight of regret for the things I've said in the past"". Teigen published a series of tweets in May apologising to TV personality Courtney Stodden, who accused her of online bullying. Stodden accepted the apology but said it could just be an attempt to limit damage to Teigen's reputation. In her latest blog post,external, Teigen said she was privately reaching out to people she'd insulted in the past, though she did not say who. ""There is simply no excuse for my past horrible tweets,"" wrote Teigen, who is married to singer John Legend. ""I was a troll, full stop. And I am so sorry."" ""I took to Twitter to try to gain attention and show off what I at the time believed was a crude, clever, harmless quip. I thought it made me cool and relatable if I poked fun at celebrities,"" she continued. ""In reality, I was insecure, immature and in a world where I thought I needed to impress strangers to be accepted,"" Teigen added. Teigen currently has 13.5 million Twitter followers and 35 million on Instagram - where she also shared a link to her blog post. Chrissy Teigen is married to award-winning musician John Legend She said she was not seeking sympathy, and that she was ""no longer the person who wrote those horrible things"" after getting married, having kids and attending therapy. ""We are all more than our worst moments,"" Teigen wrote. ""I won't ask for your forgiveness, only your patience and tolerance."" In 2011 Teigen, who was aged 25 at the time, sent Twitter messages to then-16-year-old Stodden, urging them to take their own life. During that period Stodden rose to fame as the teenage bride of actor Doug Hutchison, who was aged 50 when they married. US TV personality Courtney Stodden has said Chrissy Teigen was not the only celebrity to comment on their marriage Hutchison, who featured alongside Tom Hanks in the 1999 film The Green Mile, was divorced from Stodden last year. Stodden, whohas come out as non-binary,external, recently told The Daily Beast that other celebrities had commented on the relationship.

"Jackson Moyles and Tyrone Williams beat four other contestants to be named joint winners Two of the contestants on Great British Photography Challenge have been named joint winners of the BBC Four show. Jackson Moyles from Dunfermline and Tyrone Williams from Northampton beat four other snappers to share the honours on the show's inaugural series. ""There was no way we could split them,"" said celebrity photographer Rankin, one of the show's judges. All six hopefuls were given the whole four weeks of the show to develop a signature style and build a portfolio. Assignments ranged from smartphone camera briefs to themed challenges led by celebrity guests and creative experts. Jackson Moyles photographed Scottish landscapes as part of the wildcard assignment Moyles also photographed a model in Rankin's Studio, as part of the fashion assignment The music assignment saw Moyles capture the Glasgow band Ninth Wave, reflected in a cracked mirror Jackson Moyles' photos for the show included a landscape shot captured in his native Scotland, a fashion shot of a model carrying a red coat taken at Rankin's own studio and an arty image of Glaswegian band The Ninth Wave reflected in a cracked mirror. Rankin said the self-taught 21-year-old's work had developed ""as he found himself over the competition"". Moyles, who is currently a student and also works part-time in a care home, admitted it came ""as a bit of a surprise"" to be named joint winner considering the ""ups and downs"" he had faced over the course of the series. ""The biggest thing I took away was the importance of communicating,"" he reflected. ""When I communicated poorly, my final work suffered. Once I understood this element was vital, I produced some of my best work."" Tyrone Williams captured this black and white image of Glencoe as part of the landscape assignment A man in white trainers walking through a puddle in Soho was also photographed by Williams for the brands assignment Williams' own image of The Ninth Wave captured the band in an eerie green light, while he pictured a young woman wearing a hoodie for the fashion assignment Tyrone Williams' photos for the show included a large-format black-and-white landscape image taken in Glencoe and a shot of a man in white trainers walking through a puddle in Soho. His own image of The Ninth Wave captured the band in an eerie green light, while he snapped a young woman in a hoodie for his fashion assignment. ""Tyrone is an art photographer, with a really clear voice,"" said Rankin of the 28-year-old graphic designer. ""His work grabbed my attention from the very beginning."" Williams said it was ""such a great feeling and an amazing validation"" to be named winner but insisted that all of the contestants deserved that title equally. Rankin is a world-famous portrait and fashion photographer When the show was announced in March, Rankin said it was ""an incredible opportunity to nurture the next generation of photographers"".

"A new trade deal between the UK and Australia will not harm British farmers' livelihoods, the trade secretary has told the BBC. Liz Truss denied that imports of Australian beef would flood the UK and said British export markets would grow. The pact - the first to be built from scratch since the UK left the EU - will cover British goods such as cars, Scotch whisky, biscuits and ceramics. But some UK farmers fear they may be undercut on price and standards. Speaking to the BBC's World at One programme, Ms Truss said: ""At the moment there are extremely small quantities of Australian beef coming into the UK. ""So what we'd be looking at here is over time some of the EU imports [lost due to Brexit] being replaced by Australian imports."" How will the UK-Australia trade deal work? She added that the deal - which is seen as an important step towards the UK joining a wider Asia Pacific free-trade agreement - would also create opportunities. ""We can see the evidence, that sales of British beef international are growing to places like Asia-Pacific and the United States because people want to buy high quality British products produced in a high animal welfare way,"" Ms Truss said. Scott Morrison and Boris Johnson agreed the broad terms of the deal over dinner She said by 2030, 66% of the world's middle classes will be in Asia and they want to buy products such as whisky, cars, beef, and lamb from the UK. ""We need to be positive about what we've got to sell rather than being defensive,"" she said. However, Dominic Goudie, head of international trade at the Food and Drink Federation, expressed concern about the lack of detail in the deal. 'Safeguards' promise over UK-Australia trade deal Farmers' opposition to UK-Australia trade deal grows ""It is now vital that we know the detail of what has been agreed to help businesses understand and begin to prepare for the new terms of trade,"" he said. ""The terms must also ensure that consumers have continued confidence that any agreement maintains the highest food safety and animal welfare standards."" NFU president Minette Batters has warned farmers would struggle if the wrong deal is struck National Farmers' Union president President Minette Batters said: ""While the government has previously been keen to highlight how our free trade agreements will uphold our high standards of food production, there has always been a question mark over how this can be achieved while opening up our markets to food produced to different standards. ""We will need to know more about any provisions on animal welfare and the environment to ensure our high standards of production are not undermined by the terms of this deal."" This video can not be played 'We don't have enough beef to flood the UK market' Under the deal with Australia, the government says farmers will be protected by a cap on tariff-free imports for 15 years, using tariff rate quotas and other safeguards. But some UK farmers have concerns there will be no meaningful safeguards in place to stop them being undercut by cheap imports. Farmers in Australia are allowed to use some hormone growth promoters, pesticides, and feed additives that are banned in the UK. The UK Trade and Business Commission is worried that Australian farming operates on a scale that UK counterparts cannot compete with, saying Australia contains eight of the 10 largest farms in the world, including one which is larger than Israel. According to the UK's National Farmers Union, Australian farmers are able to produce beef at a lower cost of production, and could undercut farmers in the UK. But Ms Truss said the deal would be fully scrutinised by the Trade and Agriculture Commission and MPs could block it if they were not happy. She added that it would create better access for UK digital and financial services and better arrangements for UK citizens who want to work in Australia. Welsh lamb and Australian wine are said to have been on the menu as Boris Johnson and Scott Morrison settled the deal over dinner - but ultimately this deal is more significant in symbolic than economic terms. For the government's own estimates say the new arrangements may add just 0.02% to our GDP, and the impact on prices is negligible. But this, the first bespoke deal of the post-Brexit era, signifies global Britain's ambitions. The hope is that this paves the way for more alliances beyond the EU - starting with a group of trans-Pacific nations, the CPTPP. They only buy 8% of our exports - and we have deals already with the majority of members. But the ultimate hope is that key partners - such as the US - might also join. It also symbolises though, the sacrifices that may be needed to get deals. British farmers fear they will face more competition from Australian counterparts on their home soil. Australian farmers say they won't be flooding the market. The UK is so far away that even the 80% increase in Australian imports the government predicts equates to 0.1% of total UK imports. It'll be a while before the detail of this deal can be publicly scrutinised - even by those who'll be affected. But the concern is that this sets a marker, that  agriculture may be up for grabs when it comes to compromise in future and far bigger trade deals. The UK government has signeda long list of trade dealsover the past year, but they have been rollovers of those the UK already had as part of the EU. In 2019-20, trade in goods and services between Australia and the UK wasvalued at Â£20.1bn.,externalThe government says the deal will boost UK industries that employ 3.5 million people across the country. How many trade deals has the UK done? Why is an Australia trade deal controversial? Food and drink sector criticise Australia trade deal Metals, wine and machines,externalhave formed the biggest goods exports from Australia to the UK, while Australia'smain UK imports,externalare cars, medicines and alcoholic drinks. Trade in meat between the two countries is small at present, with 14% of sheep meat imports to the UK coming from Australia and just 0.15% of all Australian beef exports going to the UK. ""A deal would be good for my exports if there's a drop in the tariffs but if we start importing more I might be faced with more competition here,"" says Mary Quicke, owner of Devon-based artisan cheesemaker Quicke's. She exports about 10% of her produce to Australia, but is more concerned about Europe. ""I would rather they had another look at the Brexit deal and ironed out a lot of the problems there. ""There's a dreadful amount of paperwork for exporting to the EU right now, it's a complete nightmare. ""I want to preserve our beautiful patchwork of British farms, so I'm cautious. Our milk is produced with half the carbon footprint of milk worldwide so it's really important that we don't just create a worse environmental footprint."" The deal marks the end of what has essentially been a 50-year lock-out for Australian farmers, who have struggled to navigate Brussels' restrictions, tariffs and quotas. The president of the Australian National Farmers' Federation said it had been very difficult to break into the UK because it was ""way too expensive and way too far"". Australian farmers have also been looking to diversify due to the increased tensions between Australia and China. In the past year, China has imposed tariffs and restrictions on everything from Australian beef, barley and wine, to rock lobster and coal.

"This video can not be played Londonâs Cuckoo Club 'facing extinction' after lockdown easing delay Live music, theatre and other events have been dealt a ""hammer blow"" by a four-week delay to the final stage of easing lockdown restrictions in England, industry figures have said. The move means the capacity of venues will remain limited by the requirements around social distancing. The entertainment sector has appealed for urgent financial support. The Society of London Theatre said the decision would ""have serious implications for many theatres"". And the Night Time Industries Association said the PM had ""switched the lights off for an entire sector"". Boris Johnsontold a press conference on Mondaythe delay to lifting most remaining curbs on social contact was necessary to avoid ""a real possibility that the virus will outrun the vaccines and that thousands more deaths would ensue which could otherwise have been avoided"". Lockdown easing in England to be delayed One week notice 'not enough' for nightlife delay What are the lockdown rules we still have to live with? What will delaying the full unlock achieve? The government's planned date for lifting restrictions - 21 June - has now been pushed back until 19 July, amid rising Covid cases driven by the more transmissible Delta variant. But the prime minister said there would be a review after two weeks and he was ""confident"" the delay would not need to be longer than four weeks. Fans recently attended a West End performance titled The Show Must Go On Many in the entertainment industry said they understood the need for the delay, but called for further government support. Mark Davyd, chief executive of the Music Venues Trust, said the government should take ""swift and robust"" action to prevent hundreds of potential grassroots music venue closures. He said this should include ""getting financial support to people who desperately need it, extending repayment options for loans, cancelling business rates and extending support schemes such as furlough and SEISS [the self-employment income support scheme]"". The Society of London Theatre and UK Theatre said there were ""thousands of jobs hanging in the balance"" as producers make the ""difficult decision"" of whether to start rehearsals for shows that are due to open later this summer. ""Particularly at risk are large-scale commercial productions, which have received little or no Cultural Recovery Fund support and cannot survive under social distancing,"" a statement said. Trafalgar Entertainment's Sir Howard Panter and Dame Rosemary Squire, who have two major musicals due to open in London in late July, said the delay was ""yet another bungle"" from the government. ""The confusion and muddled messages are reminiscent of a West End farce,"" they said in a statement. Meanwhile, UK Cinema Association said it was ""mindful of the rationale behind today's decision"" and acknowledged many cinemas ""can still operate viably at below full occupancy"", but that they would ""continue to face significant challenges as they look to recover from the enormous financial impacts of Covid"". Lucy Noble, chair of the National Arenas Association, said the delay was ""devastating"", while trade association Live said the industry had been left ""in limbo"". Sir Ian McKellen, who is due to star in Hamlet from 21 June, said the fact theatres cannot play to full houses was ""very, very frustrating"". ""Thank goodness I'm not the producer, who must be wondering what to do, because you sold an awful lot of tickets and people may have to shift to other dates,"" he told the BBC's The One Show. ""I think they were warned in advance that might happen. ""It's a lot of trouble, but there's no doubt, a week today, we open up Hamlet at the Theatre Royal Windsor as planned, but it will be social distancing for a little bit longer than we'd hoped."" Andrew Lloyd Webber has pledged to open Cinderella at the Gillian Lynne Theatre in London However, there could be hope for some in the sector as fifteen coronavirus pilot events are to continue as planned before 19 July, including some arts and music performances. On Monday, the PM suggested Andrew Lloyd Webber's new musical Cinderella may be able to join the scheme, after the composer saidhe was prepared to be arrestedif he couldn't open as planned on 25 June. ""I think we're in talks to with him to try to make it work and we'll do whatever we can to be helpful,"" the prime minister said. But that came as a surprise to Lord Lloyd-Webber. ""My goal is, and will always be, to fight for the full and safe reopening of theatre and live music venues up and down the country,"" he said. ""I was pleased and surprised to hear the prime minister mention Cinderella as part of his announcement today, but I can't comment further on the proposed pilot until I know more about the scheme."" A string of music festivals planned for June and July were cancelled or postponed after Mr Johnson's announcement. They included the Black Deer festival in Kent, which was due to be headlined by Van Morrison at the end of June. Organisers of the Noisily Festival in Leicestershirewrote in a statement,external: ""After pouring our heart and soul into the event on a wing and a prayer - hoping against hope - to have all of that dashed again is beyond devastating."" Alex Hutchinson, who runs the Kubix festival in Sunderland, said his event would no longer take place in early July. ""I think people forget there are millions of people behind these closed industries, either directly or in the supply chains, who at the minute can't even give a definite date to be able to resume making a living,"" he told BBC Radio 5 Live. A government spokesperson said: ""We understand a delay to full reopening is challenging for live events, and we will be helping our creative industries through it. We have made Â£2bn available through the biggest arts funding package in history and the final funding round of Â£300m will be announced shortly. ""Clubs and venues have also benefited from restart grants worth Â£18,000 each, and there's nearly Â£1bn available in further discretionary grants local authorities still have to pay out. ""The furlough scheme and VAT cut is in place until September and eligible businesses will also continue to benefit from business rates relief of 75% over the year.""

"Nightclub owner David Whittall says if the night-time industry cannot open, it will require urgent financial support from the government Hospitality, wedding and night-time entertainment businesses have reacted with horror to the delay in England's full reopening until 19 July. One nightclub owner told the BBC he had been closed since March last year and had a full diary of events planned over the next few weeks, which he'll now have to cancel, losing thousands of pounds in revenue. David Whittall, who runs the nightclub and live music venue Suki10c in Digbeth, Birmingham, now has no way to pay the bills in June, he said. And wedding planners said the continuation of some restrictions meant couples were likely to defer their weddings again. Lockdown easing in England delayed to 19 July Easing delay to have 'critical impact' on business ""The sold-out events that we had booked in - that's what was going to get us through because we would have made revenue, we would have had profit, we would have been able to pay our bills. Now we don't have anything,"" Mr Whittall says. He stresses that the government needs to announce financial support, but it cannot be along the same lines as the Culture Recovery Fund, ""because it takes too long to get the money"". ""If we don't get financial support, I don't want to think about what the alternative is,"" he says. Admiral Taverns boss Chris Jowsey says the pub industry is frustrated and the carefully laid plans made by his licensee pubs ""have been wasted"" Chris Jowsey is the chief executive of community pub firm Admiral Taverns, which has more than 1,000 pubs across the UK. ""For many licensees, the situation is desperate because Covid restrictions are massively hindering pubs from trading profitably - if the regulations have to continue then we need the government to step in and offer extra support to the hospitality industry,"" he says. ""Licensees are losing money because they are having to hire extra staff members to cope with restrictions like table service and social distancing."" The British Beer and Pub Association has warned that four additional weeks of restrictions will cost pubs Â£400m. It says pubs must be allowed to ""open properly"" on 19 July. Mr Whittall says he is surprised the prime minister didn't announce any additional financial support: ""We've got bills that need paying now... I'm not sure what we're supposed to do now."" A spokesman for the Treasury said: ""We are committed to helping businesses and individuals through the pandemic and deliberately went long with our support to provide certainty over the coming months. ""The furlough scheme and support for the self-employed is in place until September and eligible businesses will continue to benefit from business rates relief of 75% over the year, VAT cuts and the Recovery Loan Scheme."" Event and wedding planning studio founder Matthew Shaw is concerned about how his industry and suppliers will cope with continued restrictions Wedding venues and planners have told the BBC that the government's announcement about unlimited guest numbers being permitted has provided some relief, but they are still deeply worried about the future of their industry. Matthew Shaw, founder and creative director at Sauveur, a creative events and luxury wedding planning studio in London, has already been on the phone to his clients, who are confused about what they are allowed to do at their weddings. Many are upset about the fact they cannot have a dance floor indoors and they want to cancel the bands they have booked, Matthew says, which puts pressure on the suppliers Sauveur works with. ""Dance floors and drinks receptions are the things people want,"" he tells the BBC. ""It's great to have a meal, to be with people, but when you take away the key elements of what make a wedding special...people don't want to spend the money on it anymore."" Earlier this year, his marquee supplier went under. That means he will have to try to forge relationships with new suppliers, while hoping the existing ones are still coping and are resilient when clients pull the plug or decide to postpone their events. Sarah Callander Beckett, owner of wedding venue Combermere Abbey in Cheshire, says it could be difficult if couples all want to defer their weddings again Mr Shaw says that the last year has taken a toll on his mental health and that of his staff, clients and suppliers: ""I've spent sleepless nights wondering whether events will still be able to run, and whether we will still be able to get new clients, after watching new and existing clients drop away."" Sarah Callander Beckett, owner of wedding venue Combermere Abbey in Cheshire, agrees with Mr Shaw. They say some clients might prefer to defer their weddings again. But this creates an additional headache as the calendar for the rest of this year and into next year is already pretty packed for many businesses in the industry. ""These are some difficult decisions we'll have to facilitate as a business in the next few days managing expectations and emotions,"" Ms Beckett says. ""Ideally what we want to see is also the return of dancing and mingling amongst guests."" Keith Marsden is the landlord of the Prince of Wales pub in Moseley, Birmingham. Prince of Wales pub landlord Keith Marsden says the pub industry cannot continue to survive at only a third of its capacity He says that social distancing has proved a significant challenge and a continuation of restrictions will deeply impact his bottom line. Mr Marsden recently had his worst day of trading since he started the business, with takings of just Â£96. ""With social distancing whether you're inside or outside, you just cannot get the capacity,"" he says. ""We're operating at about one-third of our capacity, so we just cannot do the numbers to make a profit."" He says that people have fallen out of the habit of going to the pub: ""We're hanging in there but we're in serious trouble. ""It really will be the final nail in the coffin for many."" He's also worried about the financial challenges ahead, and the debt that he and others in the industry have built up. ""If you come in here on a busy weekend you think, oh yeah they're doing quite nicely, but beneath the surface there's lots of problems lurking,"" says Mr Marsden. ""People haven't aggressively chased debt, landlords have let people off with rent, business rates holidays, things like that. They're now coming to the surface."" Caterers for the festival and events industry say the delays in relaxing Covid restrictions is ""devastating"" for the sector The Nationwide Caterers Association (NCASS), which represents caterers in the festival and events sectors, including mobile and street food businesses, is also calling on the government to provide immediate financial support. ""Festival caterers will still not be able to work after already losing the 2020 season - it is devastating for the sector as a whole,"" the industry body's director Mark Laurie says. ""There are ten of thousands of businesses involved in the festival industry who are going to suffer huge losses."" Latest research from Live, the trade body for the UK live events sector, suggests the industry faces losses of more than Â£500m as at least 5,000 shows will be cancelled. ""Any delay to the 21 June reopening date will have significant and immediate repercussions, including 248 grassroots music venues that would face an immediate threat of eviction without a comprehensive response from the government that fully addresses their financial losses from delayed reopening,"" the trade body has warned. Mr Laurie says that caterers have had ""little to no help"" from the government or local authorities: ""The Additional Restrictions Grants (ARG) for those without fixed premises won't work to support theses businesses and so that must be addressed. ""NCASS is calling on the government to publish the results of the Events Research Programme, to provide immediate financial support to affected businesses and provide a clear way forward."" It is a terrible three-way balancing act - a race not just between the vaccine and the variant, but also viability of thousands of businesses. A cost-benefit analysis without many benefits. The signalling of 21 June as ""freedom day"" was meant to give businesses long-term confidence to plan staffing, stocking and reversing the mothballing of their hospitality venues. Indoor venues will incur substantial losses over the next month. The message from the government is that the support package they put in place at the Budget already accounted for this eventuality. The furlough scheme has begun a slow phase-out, whereas in many other similar countries, employer contributions are already required, or the schemes have ended. Ministers also point at the strength of the economic bounce-back and record hiring and vacancy statistics. But that will come as little comfort to industries now shut for 15 months, such as nightclubs. Local authorities have yet to allocate Â£1bn, about half of the discretionary fund. The ideal picture, as the prime minister put it, is that they will not be rolling back any of the currently implemented roadmap. As we know, the impact on the economy comes not just from mandatory lockdowns, but from voluntary social distancing as consumers stay away from crowded places if they feel the virus is out of control. On two crucial occasions last March and last Autumn, the government chose to prioritise economic reopening, with consequences for the scale of the outbreak that followed, which in turn definitively failed to be of any benefit to the economy. This time it appears they are learning a lesson from recent history, and proceeding cautiously. The calculation is that the immediate extra economic pain will be outweighed by fewer deaths and a confident irreversible reopening in a month's time.

"Nightclub owner David Whittall says if the night-time industry cannot open, it will require urgent financial support from the government Hospitality, wedding and night-time entertainment businesses have reacted with horror to the delay in England's full reopening until 19 July. One nightclub owner told the BBC he had been closed since March last year and had a full diary of events planned over the next few weeks, which he'll now have to cancel, losing thousands of pounds in revenue. David Whittall, who runs the nightclub and live music venue Suki10c in Digbeth, Birmingham, now has no way to pay the bills in June, he said. And wedding planners said the continuation of some restrictions meant couples were likely to defer their weddings again. Lockdown easing in England delayed to 19 July Easing delay to have 'critical impact' on business ""The sold-out events that we had booked in - that's what was going to get us through because we would have made revenue, we would have had profit, we would have been able to pay our bills. Now we don't have anything,"" Mr Whittall says. He stresses that the government needs to announce financial support, but it cannot be along the same lines as the Culture Recovery Fund, ""because it takes too long to get the money"". ""If we don't get financial support, I don't want to think about what the alternative is,"" he says.

"This video can not be played Londonâs Cuckoo Club 'facing extinction' after lockdown easing delay Live music, theatre and other events have been dealt a ""hammer blow"" by a four-week delay to the final stage of easing lockdown restrictions in England, industry figures have said. The move means the capacity of venues will remain limited by the requirements around social distancing. The entertainment sector has appealed for urgent financial support. The Society of London Theatre said the decision would ""have serious implications for many theatres"". And the Night Time Industries Association said the PM had ""switched the lights off for an entire sector"". Boris Johnsontold a press conference on Mondaythe delay to lifting most remaining curbs on social contact was necessary to avoid ""a real possibility that the virus will outrun the vaccines and that thousands more deaths would ensue which could otherwise have been avoided"". Lockdown easing in England to be delayed One week notice 'not enough' for nightlife delay What are the lockdown rules we still have to live with? What will delaying the full unlock achieve? The government's planned date for lifting restrictions - 21 June - has now been pushed back until 19 July, amid rising Covid cases driven by the more transmissible Delta variant. But the prime minister said there would be a review after two weeks and he was ""confident"" the delay would not need to be longer than four weeks. Fans recently attended a West End performance titled The Show Must Go On Many in the entertainment industry said they understood the need for the delay, but called for further government support. Mark Davyd, chief executive of the Music Venues Trust, said the government should take ""swift and robust"" action to prevent hundreds of potential grassroots music venue closures. He said this should include ""getting financial support to people who desperately need it, extending repayment options for loans, cancelling business rates and extending support schemes such as furlough and SEISS [the self-employment income support scheme]"". The Society of London Theatre and UK Theatre said there were ""thousands of jobs hanging in the balance"" as producers make the ""difficult decision"" of whether to start rehearsals for shows that are due to open later this summer. ""Particularly at risk are large-scale commercial productions, which have received little or no Cultural Recovery Fund support and cannot survive under social distancing,"" a statement said. Trafalgar Entertainment's Sir Howard Panter and Dame Rosemary Squire, who have two major musicals due to open in London in late July, said the delay was ""yet another bungle"" from the government. ""The confusion and muddled messages are reminiscent of a West End farce,"" they said in a statement. Meanwhile, UK Cinema Association said it was ""mindful of the rationale behind today's decision"" and acknowledged many cinemas ""can still operate viably at below full occupancy"", but that they would ""continue to face significant challenges as they look to recover from the enormous financial impacts of Covid"". Lucy Noble, chair of the National Arenas Association, said the delay was ""devastating"", while trade association Live said the industry had been left ""in limbo"". Sir Ian McKellen, who is due to star in Hamlet from 21 June, said the fact theatres cannot play to full houses was ""very, very frustrating"". ""Thank goodness I'm not the producer, who must be wondering what to do, because you sold an awful lot of tickets and people may have to shift to other dates,"" he told the BBC's The One Show. ""I think they were warned in advance that might happen. ""It's a lot of trouble, but there's no doubt, a week today, we open up Hamlet at the Theatre Royal Windsor as planned, but it will be social distancing for a little bit longer than we'd hoped."" Andrew Lloyd Webber has pledged to open Cinderella at the Gillian Lynne Theatre in London However, there could be hope for some in the sector as fifteen coronavirus pilot events are to continue as planned before 19 July, including some arts and music performances. On Monday, the PM suggested Andrew Lloyd Webber's new musical Cinderella may be able to join the scheme, after the composer saidhe was prepared to be arrestedif he couldn't open as planned on 25 June. ""I think we're in talks to with him to try to make it work and we'll do whatever we can to be helpful,"" the prime minister said. But that came as a surprise to Lord Lloyd-Webber. ""My goal is, and will always be, to fight for the full and safe reopening of theatre and live music venues up and down the country,"" he said. ""I was pleased and surprised to hear the prime minister mention Cinderella as part of his announcement today, but I can't comment further on the proposed pilot until I know more about the scheme."" A string of music festivals planned for June and July were cancelled or postponed after Mr Johnson's announcement. They included the Black Deer festival in Kent, which was due to be headlined by Van Morrison at the end of June. Organisers of the Noisily Festival in Leicestershirewrote in a statement,external: ""After pouring our heart and soul into the event on a wing and a prayer - hoping against hope - to have all of that dashed again is beyond devastating."" Alex Hutchinson, who runs the Kubix festival in Sunderland, said his event would no longer take place in early July. ""I think people forget there are millions of people behind these closed industries, either directly or in the supply chains, who at the minute can't even give a definite date to be able to resume making a living,"" he told BBC Radio 5 Live. A government spokesperson said: ""We understand a delay to full reopening is challenging for live events, and we will be helping our creative industries through it. We have made Â£2bn available through the biggest arts funding package in history and the final funding round of Â£300m will be announced shortly. ""Clubs and venues have also benefited from restart grants worth Â£18,000 each, and there's nearly Â£1bn available in further discretionary grants local authorities still have to pay out. ""The furlough scheme and VAT cut is in place until September and eligible businesses will also continue to benefit from business rates relief of 75% over the year.""

"This video can not be played Disappointment for fans as Scotland lose opening Euro match Scotland fans have seen their team's first appearance in a major tournament in 23 years end in a disappointing 2-0 defeat. About 12,000 people were in Hampden Park in Glasgow to watch the Euro 2020 match against the Czech Republic. A further 3,000 people watched from a fan zone in the city, while many tuned in to the TV from home or in pubs. But goals in either half from the Czech Republic's Patrik Schick left the Tartan Army crushed. Steve Clarke's men now sit bottom of Group D and will play England in London on Friday. First Minister Nicola Sturgeontweeted a tearful emoji,externalbut added: ""Onwards and upwards though...next stop Wembley."" They are due to play England on Friday, before returning to Hampden for the final group game against Croatia on 22 June. Schick wonder goal helps Czech Republic beat Scotland In pictures: Fans watch Scotland's Euros return How Scotland has changed since France '98 Richard Templeton, 33, a lawyer from Edinburgh, said he felt ""dejected"" by the defeat. He said: ""They tried their best. They are going to beat England so I'm not so worried about this match."" He said he took the day off work to watch the game in a pub in the capital but was still optimistic Scotland would qualify. Richard Templeton (left) and Ally Atha watched the match in Edinburgh Ally Atha, 34, a marketing manager from Edinburgh, also watched the match in a pub. He said: ""I feel crestfallen. I thought they were going to win. ""I have no hope now for the tournamentâ¦ all my optimism is deflated, but it's good to be here."" Fellow Tartan Army fan John Allardice felt Scotland manager Steve Clarke should take much of the blame for the result. He said: ""Poor team selection and a negative mentality gets you exactly what you deserve. Really hoping the manager will make bolder choices for the England game, even if we get a pasting. Scotland fans react to the opening goal in the Glasgow fan zone Malcolm MacKenzie said the result reminded him of the disappointment of watching Scotland at the World Cup in Argentina 43 years ago. He said: ""It will be the same as Ally McLeod not playing an in-form Souness in Argentina in 1978 - lose the first two games and be out before he plays Billy Gilmour in the Croatia game, and he plays out of his skin and Scotland win at a canter."" Scotland supporters in the Glasgow Green fan zone said the atmosphere was ""unbelievable"" and a far better option than watching the game in a pub. Concerns had beenraised about the safety of the eventamid the pandemic and rising case numbers in Glasgow. But Eddie Smith, 25, from Dunfermline, said: ""It needed to go ahead here and it's unbelievable it has. The security is great, everyone is sitting down, spaced apart. ""If you didn't have this, everyone would be firing into a pub or a flat, with a lot more than six people."" Supporters outside the fan zone before the match Supporters delivered a rousing rendition of Flower of Scotland on Glasgow Green James Hill, 26, was joined by his friends Steven Thistleton, 25, and Ross McArthur, 19, at the outdoor event. He said: ""It's basically a massive beer garden, although I was a bit shocked that it's Â£13 for a pizza. Pints are Â£6 which is all right. ""We've not come into close contact with anyone outside our group, everything's getting brought to us.

"This video can not be played PM Boris Johnson: ""Now is the time to ease off the accelerator"" The final stage of easing lockdown restrictions in England is to be delayed until 19 July. It means most remaining curbs on social contact will continue beyond 21 June, when they had been due to be lifted. The limit on wedding guest numbers will be removed but venues will still have to adhere to other rules. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said there would be a review after two weeks and he was ""confident"" the delay would not need to be longer than four weeks. However, he told a Downing Street press conference he could not rule out the possibility the date could be pushed back further. Scientists advising the government had warned of a ""significant resurgence"" in people needing hospital treatment for Covid-19 if stage four of easing the lockdown went ahead on 21 June. It comes amid rising cases, driven by the more transmissible Delta variant, which was first identified in India. What are the rules after 21 June? 'We're in serious trouble,' says hospitality sector What will delaying the full unlock achieve? How many people can go to a wedding and reception? Mr Johnson said going ahead with stage four on 21 June would mean ""a real possibility"" of the virus outrunning the vaccines, leading to thousands more deaths which could otherwise have been avoided. The delay would give the NHS ""a few more crucial weeks"" to get people vaccinated, he said, adding that while the link between infections and hospital admissions had been ""weakened"" it had not been ""severed"". ""We will monitor the position every day and if, after two weeks, we have concluded that the risk has diminished, then we reserve the possibility of proceeding to step four and a full opening sooner,"" he said. ""At a certain stage, we are going to have to learn to live with the virus and to manage it as best we can,"" he added. Addressing MPs in the Commons later, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the decision not to ease restrictions next week was being made with a ""heavy heart"" but the government's four tests for easing restrictions - one of which is that the risks are not fundamentally changed by new variants - had not been met. He said extra testing facilities and access to vaccines would be rolled out in more areas of the country, while vaccinations would be opened up on Tuesday in England to people aged 23 and 24. The number of guests at weddings and wakes will no longer be limited to 30 But venues will have to adhere to social distancing and hosts will have to do a risk assessment Table service will be required and no indoor dance floors allowed Care home residents will no-longer have to isolate for 14 days after returning from visits outside. Exceptions will include high-risk trips such as overnight hospital stays The delay means limits remain on how many people can meet, with groups of up to 30 allowed to meet outdoors and up to six people or two households allowed indoors. However, 15 coronavirus pilot events will continue as planned, including some upcoming Euro 2020 games,Wimbledonand arts and music performances. Attendees will have to show proof of vaccination or a recent negative test. Capacity limits will continue at other venues and nightclubs will stay closed. Advice to work from home where possible will remain in place. The extension of restrictions will be put to a Commons vote, which could trigger a sizeable Conservative backbench rebellion, with a debate expected on Wednesday. LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? SOCIAL DISTANCING:How can I meet my friend safely? FACE MASKS:When do I need to wear one? Mr Johnson said two-thirds of adults would have been offered two coronavirus jabs by 19 July, including all vulnerable groups. The gap between doses for over-40s in England will be reduced from 12 to eight weeks. And the target to offer all adults a first dose will be brought forward to 19 July. It comes as new analysis by Public Health England shows two doses of either the Pfizer or AstraZeneca vaccine are highly effective at preventing hospital admissions from the Delta variant. PHE said the effectiveness was comparable to against the Alpha variant which was previously dominant in the UK. The size of a future surge in infections is uncertain because questions remain about the Delta variant, vaccines and people's behaviour once rules are relaxed. The Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling (SPI-M) said a third wave could range from ""considerably smaller than January 2021 to considerably higher"". It said even a short delay to easing the restrictions would lead to a significant drop in the number of Covid patients in hospital as more people were vaccinated and the school holidays got closer, reducing transmission. Scientists have advised the government delaying by four weeks would reduce the peak in hospital admissions by between a third and a half. The government's chief scientific advisor Sir Patrick Vallance said there would still be an increase in numbers and an increase in hospitalisations ""because that's what happens when there's more mixing"". Labour's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said the public had been ""let down by ministerial incompetence and indecision"". ""The only reason this delay is being introduced is because the Conservatives failed to secure the country's borders and a new variant from overseas was allowed to take hold; and failed to put in measures like proper sick pay support and surge vaccinations when needed,"" he said. There are plenty of benefits to delaying the full unlock. More vaccinations will be done and the impact of this wave in terms of hospitalisations will be reduced. We could also see the rise in infections slow as the initial surge meets the wall of immunity already built up by the vaccination campaign. But make no mistake the coming weeks will see a real resurgence of Covid. Infection levels are already climbing steeply and modelling suggests there could be 1,000 hospital admissions a day by the middle of summer. That is the same number that the NHS would normally see for all types of respiratory illness in the depths of a bad winter. The proportion of people dying should be much much lower than it was in previous waves though thanks to the protective effect of vaccines. But the alternative would be a reintroduction of restrictions. It is a price worth paying, the government believes. The Night Time Industries Association said the delay to the roadmap was a ""devastating blow"" that would ""drive down confidence in the sector to a new low"", forcing more workers to leave the industry. Julian Bird, chief executive of the Society of London Theatre and UK Theatre, said thousands of jobs were ""hanging in the balance"", with venues no longer able to increase their capacity as planned. Reopening delay a 'hammer blow for live events' Businesses react to easing delay Many pubs and restaurants are also trading at a loss because of social distancing measures. Industry trade body UKHospitality called for additional financial support for affected businesses, saying the delay would cost the sector around Â£3bn in sales. The government has said it will not extend the furlough scheme or other financial support further, despite the delay to the unlocking roadmap. Under thefurlough scheme, the government covers up to 80% of an employee's salary for the hours they cannot work because of the pandemic. The scheme is due to run until the end of September but employers will have to help cover the cost from July. Some Tory MPs were also critical of the delay, with senior backbencher Sir Robert Neill saying a few weeks made ""the difference between survival or closure for some businesses"". The rise in cases in the UK is being driven by the Delta variant, first identified in India, which is believed to be around 60% more infectious than the previous dominant variant and twice as likely to result in hospital admissions. On Monday, the UK has recorded 7,742 new cases of Covid-19 and three deaths within 28 days of a positive test. The seven-day average for cases in the UK is up 46% compared with the seven days before. Plans for easing coronavirus restrictions differ between the four UK nations. All areas ofScotlandare due to move to Level Zero Covid restrictions on 28 June - meaning bigger groups can gather in cafes, pubs and restaurants, although they will still have to observe social distancing. Limits on indoor gatherings inNorthern Irelandare scheduled to be relaxed on 21 June and the rules inWaleswill be reviewed on 25 June. Are you affected by the delay to restrictions easing in England?

"The government in England is delaying the full lifting of restrictions in England by four weeks. It comes amid rising infection rates. But what difference does waiting another month make? The most obvious consequence will be that a greater number of people will have been vaccinated. The government has now brought forward its target to offer all adults a first dose of a vaccine to 19 July. This is nearly two weeks earlier than the original deadline and means all adults will have had the opportunity to have at least one dose by the time all restrictions are due to lift. Not everyone will come forward, but if the number of vaccinations being done at the moment remains consistent it would mean more than three-quarters of adults will have had two jabs and nearly nine in 10 one jab. Chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance says this will act as a ""double protection"". That is because the over-40s, who are most at risk of serious illness, will have had the chance to be fully vaccinated. Meanwhile, younger age groups, who have the highest rates of infection, will have the benefit of one jab if they take up the offer. As well as providing some protection to them, this will help slow the spread of the virus. All this though is dependent on supply. The UK has plenty of AstraZeneca doses - there is thought to be a stockpile of about five million - but the under-30s, who are now being given their first dose, are being offered Pfizer or Moderna because of concern about blood clots. That has to be imported, and is essentially being used as soon as it arrives. Infection rates are already rising rapidly - doubling every 10 days or so. On current trends, we could hit January levels of infections by the end of July. The fear was that opening up further would have allowed the virus to spread even more quickly than it is now. By delaying opening up by four weeks, government modellers say it could reduce the number of those cases ending up in hospital by between a third and a half to around 1,000 a day in the summer. The rises we are seeing at the moment could also start to slow during this period. That's because of the high levels of immunity in the population from the vaccination programme, which will make it harder for the virus to spread after an initial surge. Prof Jonathan Ball, an expert in viruses at University of Nottingham, says his hope is the increases that are being seen now will start to flatten. ""I think in a few weeks we could see it slow. I certainly don't think the speed of the rises we are seeing now will continue for long, given how well the vaccines work."" And if that has not happened by late July, the break-up of schools for the summer holidays could help tip the scales, as it will reduce contacts among young people where Covid is spreading more quickly. But even if infections continue to rise, the delay will still be of benefit as it will give government scientists a better grasp of what the consequences are in terms of hospitalisations. One of the crucial elements, that is not fully understood at the moment, is to what extent the vaccination programme has broken the link between infections and serious illness. Hospitalisations have started to rise - albeit from a low base. Early data suggests about 4% of confirmed cases are currently ending up in hospital although there is a lot of uncertainty around this, as the impact of the rise in infections in recent weeks is only just translating into admissions. That is less than half the proportion ending up in hospital during the winter wave. But the data only tells you part of the story. It also seems that the patients ending up in hospital are less sick, and are being discharged more quickly. So it is pretty clear - as we would expect given the vaccine rollout - that the link between infections and hospital cases is significantly weakened, but to what extent exactly remains to be seen. Fully understanding this will enable scientists to give ministers a clearer idea of what the consequences of a full unlock will be if cases are still rising come 19 July, and therefore whether any measures at all may need to be retained.

"Nightclub owner David Whittall says if the night-time industry cannot open, it will require urgent financial support from the government Hospitality, wedding and night-time entertainment businesses have reacted with horror to the delay in England's full reopening until 19 July. One nightclub owner told the BBC he had been closed since March last year and had a full diary of events planned over the next few weeks, which he'll now have to cancel, losing thousands of pounds in revenue. David Whittall, who runs the nightclub and live music venue Suki10c in Digbeth, Birmingham, now has no way to pay the bills in June, he said. And wedding planners said the continuation of some restrictions meant couples were likely to defer their weddings again. Lockdown easing in England delayed to 19 July Easing delay to have 'critical impact' on business ""The sold-out events that we had booked in - that's what was going to get us through because we would have made revenue, we would have had profit, we would have been able to pay our bills. Now we don't have anything,"" Mr Whittall says. He stresses that the government needs to announce financial support, but it cannot be along the same lines as the Culture Recovery Fund, ""because it takes too long to get the money"". ""If we don't get financial support, I don't want to think about what the alternative is,"" he says. Admiral Taverns boss Chris Jowsey says the pub industry is frustrated and the carefully laid plans made by his licensee pubs ""have been wasted"" Chris Jowsey is the chief executive of community pub firm Admiral Taverns, which has more than 1,000 pubs across the UK. ""For many licensees, the situation is desperate because Covid restrictions are massively hindering pubs from trading profitably - if the regulations have to continue then we need the government to step in and offer extra support to the hospitality industry,"" he says. ""Licensees are losing money because they are having to hire extra staff members to cope with restrictions like table service and social distancing."" The British Beer and Pub Association has warned that four additional weeks of restrictions will cost pubs Â£400m. It says pubs must be allowed to ""open properly"" on 19 July. Mr Whittall says he is surprised the prime minister didn't announce any additional financial support: ""We've got bills that need paying now... I'm not sure what we're supposed to do now."" A spokesman for the Treasury said: ""We are committed to helping businesses and individuals through the pandemic and deliberately went long with our support to provide certainty over the coming months. ""The furlough scheme and support for the self-employed is in place until September and eligible businesses will continue to benefit from business rates relief of 75% over the year, VAT cuts and the Recovery Loan Scheme."" Event and wedding planning studio founder Matthew Shaw is concerned about how his industry and suppliers will cope with continued restrictions Wedding venues and planners have told the BBC that the government's announcement about unlimited guest numbers being permitted has provided some relief, but they are still deeply worried about the future of their industry. Matthew Shaw, founder and creative director at Sauveur, a creative events and luxury wedding planning studio in London, has already been on the phone to his clients, who are confused about what they are allowed to do at their weddings. Many are upset about the fact they cannot have a dance floor indoors and they want to cancel the bands they have booked, Matthew says, which puts pressure on the suppliers Sauveur works with. ""Dance floors and drinks receptions are the things people want,"" he tells the BBC. ""It's great to have a meal, to be with people, but when you take away the key elements of what make a wedding special...people don't want to spend the money on it anymore."" Earlier this year, his marquee supplier went under. That means he will have to try to forge relationships with new suppliers, while hoping the existing ones are still coping and are resilient when clients pull the plug or decide to postpone their events. Sarah Callander Beckett, owner of wedding venue Combermere Abbey in Cheshire, says it could be difficult if couples all want to defer their weddings again Mr Shaw says that the last year has taken a toll on his mental health and that of his staff, clients and suppliers: ""I've spent sleepless nights wondering whether events will still be able to run, and whether we will still be able to get new clients, after watching new and existing clients drop away."" Sarah Callander Beckett, owner of wedding venue Combermere Abbey in Cheshire, agrees with Mr Shaw. They say some clients might prefer to defer their weddings again. But this creates an additional headache as the calendar for the rest of this year and into next year is already pretty packed for many businesses in the industry. ""These are some difficult decisions we'll have to facilitate as a business in the next few days managing expectations and emotions,"" Ms Beckett says. ""Ideally what we want to see is also the return of dancing and mingling amongst guests."" Keith Marsden is the landlord of the Prince of Wales pub in Moseley, Birmingham. Prince of Wales pub landlord Keith Marsden says the pub industry cannot continue to survive at only a third of its capacity He says that social distancing has proved a significant challenge and a continuation of restrictions will deeply impact his bottom line. Mr Marsden recently had his worst day of trading since he started the business, with takings of just Â£96. ""With social distancing whether you're inside or outside, you just cannot get the capacity,"" he says. ""We're operating at about one-third of our capacity, so we just cannot do the numbers to make a profit."" He says that people have fallen out of the habit of going to the pub: ""We're hanging in there but we're in serious trouble. ""It really will be the final nail in the coffin for many."" He's also worried about the financial challenges ahead, and the debt that he and others in the industry have built up. ""If you come in here on a busy weekend you think, oh yeah they're doing quite nicely, but beneath the surface there's lots of problems lurking,"" says Mr Marsden. ""People haven't aggressively chased debt, landlords have let people off with rent, business rates holidays, things like that. They're now coming to the surface."" Caterers for the festival and events industry say the delays in relaxing Covid restrictions is ""devastating"" for the sector The Nationwide Caterers Association (NCASS), which represents caterers in the festival and events sectors, including mobile and street food businesses, is also calling on the government to provide immediate financial support. ""Festival caterers will still not be able to work after already losing the 2020 season - it is devastating for the sector as a whole,"" the industry body's director Mark Laurie says. ""There are ten of thousands of businesses involved in the festival industry who are going to suffer huge losses."" Latest research from Live, the trade body for the UK live events sector, suggests the industry faces losses of more than Â£500m as at least 5,000 shows will be cancelled. ""Any delay to the 21 June reopening date will have significant and immediate repercussions, including 248 grassroots music venues that would face an immediate threat of eviction without a comprehensive response from the government that fully addresses their financial losses from delayed reopening,"" the trade body has warned. Mr Laurie says that caterers have had ""little to no help"" from the government or local authorities: ""The Additional Restrictions Grants (ARG) for those without fixed premises won't work to support theses businesses and so that must be addressed. ""NCASS is calling on the government to publish the results of the Events Research Programme, to provide immediate financial support to affected businesses and provide a clear way forward."" It is a terrible three-way balancing act - a race not just between the vaccine and the variant, but also viability of thousands of businesses. A cost-benefit analysis without many benefits. The signalling of 21 June as ""freedom day"" was meant to give businesses long-term confidence to plan staffing, stocking and reversing the mothballing of their hospitality venues. Indoor venues will incur substantial losses over the next month. The message from the government is that the support package they put in place at the Budget already accounted for this eventuality. The furlough scheme has begun a slow phase-out, whereas in many other similar countries, employer contributions are already required, or the schemes have ended. Ministers also point at the strength of the economic bounce-back and record hiring and vacancy statistics. But that will come as little comfort to industries now shut for 15 months, such as nightclubs. Local authorities have yet to allocate Â£1bn, about half of the discretionary fund. The ideal picture, as the prime minister put it, is that they will not be rolling back any of the currently implemented roadmap. As we know, the impact on the economy comes not just from mandatory lockdowns, but from voluntary social distancing as consumers stay away from crowded places if they feel the virus is out of control. On two crucial occasions last March and last Autumn, the government chose to prioritise economic reopening, with consequences for the scale of the outbreak that followed, which in turn definitively failed to be of any benefit to the economy. This time it appears they are learning a lesson from recent history, and proceeding cautiously. The calculation is that the immediate extra economic pain will be outweighed by fewer deaths and a confident irreversible reopening in a month's time.

"This video can not be played Londonâs Cuckoo Club 'facing extinction' after lockdown easing delay Live music, theatre and other events have been dealt a ""hammer blow"" by a four-week delay to the final stage of easing lockdown restrictions in England, industry figures have said. The move means the capacity of venues will remain limited by the requirements around social distancing. The entertainment sector has appealed for urgent financial support. The Society of London Theatre said the decision would ""have serious implications for many theatres"". And the Night Time Industries Association said the PM had ""switched the lights off for an entire sector"". Boris Johnsontold a press conference on Mondaythe delay to lifting most remaining curbs on social contact was necessary to avoid ""a real possibility that the virus will outrun the vaccines and that thousands more deaths would ensue which could otherwise have been avoided"". Lockdown easing in England to be delayed One week notice 'not enough' for nightlife delay What are the lockdown rules we still have to live with? What will delaying the full unlock achieve? The government's planned date for lifting restrictions - 21 June - has now been pushed back until 19 July, amid rising Covid cases driven by the more transmissible Delta variant. But the prime minister said there would be a review after two weeks and he was ""confident"" the delay would not need to be longer than four weeks. Fans recently attended a West End performance titled The Show Must Go On Many in the entertainment industry said they understood the need for the delay, but called for further government support. Mark Davyd, chief executive of the Music Venues Trust, said the government should take ""swift and robust"" action to prevent hundreds of potential grassroots music venue closures. He said this should include ""getting financial support to people who desperately need it, extending repayment options for loans, cancelling business rates and extending support schemes such as furlough and SEISS [the self-employment income support scheme]"". The Society of London Theatre and UK Theatre said there were ""thousands of jobs hanging in the balance"" as producers make the ""difficult decision"" of whether to start rehearsals for shows that are due to open later this summer. ""Particularly at risk are large-scale commercial productions, which have received little or no Cultural Recovery Fund support and cannot survive under social distancing,"" a statement said. Trafalgar Entertainment's Sir Howard Panter and Dame Rosemary Squire, who have two major musicals due to open in London in late July, said the delay was ""yet another bungle"" from the government. ""The confusion and muddled messages are reminiscent of a West End farce,"" they said in a statement. Meanwhile, UK Cinema Association said it was ""mindful of the rationale behind today's decision"" and acknowledged many cinemas ""can still operate viably at below full occupancy"", but that they would ""continue to face significant challenges as they look to recover from the enormous financial impacts of Covid"". Lucy Noble, chair of the National Arenas Association, said the delay was ""devastating"", while trade association Live said the industry had been left ""in limbo"". Sir Ian McKellen, who is due to star in Hamlet from 21 June, said the fact theatres cannot play to full houses was ""very, very frustrating"". ""Thank goodness I'm not the producer, who must be wondering what to do, because you sold an awful lot of tickets and people may have to shift to other dates,"" he told the BBC's The One Show. ""I think they were warned in advance that might happen. ""It's a lot of trouble, but there's no doubt, a week today, we open up Hamlet at the Theatre Royal Windsor as planned, but it will be social distancing for a little bit longer than we'd hoped."" Andrew Lloyd Webber has pledged to open Cinderella at the Gillian Lynne Theatre in London However, there could be hope for some in the sector as fifteen coronavirus pilot events are to continue as planned before 19 July, including some arts and music performances. On Monday, the PM suggested Andrew Lloyd Webber's new musical Cinderella may be able to join the scheme, after the composer saidhe was prepared to be arrestedif he couldn't open as planned on 25 June. ""I think we're in talks to with him to try to make it work and we'll do whatever we can to be helpful,"" the prime minister said. But that came as a surprise to Lord Lloyd-Webber. ""My goal is, and will always be, to fight for the full and safe reopening of theatre and live music venues up and down the country,"" he said. ""I was pleased and surprised to hear the prime minister mention Cinderella as part of his announcement today, but I can't comment further on the proposed pilot until I know more about the scheme."" A string of music festivals planned for June and July were cancelled or postponed after Mr Johnson's announcement. They included the Black Deer festival in Kent, which was due to be headlined by Van Morrison at the end of June. Organisers of the Noisily Festival in Leicestershirewrote in a statement,external: ""After pouring our heart and soul into the event on a wing and a prayer - hoping against hope - to have all of that dashed again is beyond devastating.""

""I think people forget there are millions of people behind these closed industries, either directly or in the supply chains, who at the minute can't even give a definite date to be able to resume making a living,"" he told BBC Radio 5 Live. A government spokesperson said: ""We understand a delay to full reopening is challenging for live events, and we will be helping our creative industries through it. We have made Â£2bn available through the biggest arts funding package in history and the final funding round of Â£300m will be announced shortly. ""Clubs and venues have also benefited from restart grants worth Â£18,000 each, and there's nearly Â£1bn available in further discretionary grants local authorities still have to pay out.

Lockdown easing in England delayed to 19 July Easing delay to have 'critical impact' on business ""The sold-out events that we had booked in - that's what was going to get us through because we would have made revenue, we would have had profit, we would have been able to pay our bills. Now we don't have anything,"" Mr Whittall says. He stresses that the government needs to announce financial support, but it cannot be along the same lines as the Culture Recovery Fund, ""because it takes too long to get the money"". ""If we don't get financial support, I don't want to think about what the alternative is,"" he says. Admiral Taverns boss Chris Jowsey says the pub industry is frustrated and the carefully laid plans made by his licensee pubs ""have been wasted"" Chris Jowsey is the chief executive of community pub firm Admiral Taverns, which has more than 1,000 pubs across the UK. ""For many licensees, the situation is desperate because Covid restrictions are massively hindering pubs from trading profitably - if the regulations have to continue then we need the government to step in and offer extra support to the hospitality industry,"" he says. ""Licensees are losing money because they are having to hire extra staff members to cope with restrictions like table service and social distancing."" The British Beer and Pub Association has warned that four additional weeks of restrictions will cost pubs Â£400m. It says pubs must be allowed to ""open properly"" on 19 July. Mr Whittall says he is surprised the prime minister didn't announce any additional financial support: ""We've got bills that need paying now... I'm not sure what we're supposed to do now."" A spokesman for the Treasury said: ""We are committed to helping businesses and individuals through the pandemic and deliberately went long with our support to provide certainty over the coming months. ""The furlough scheme and support for the self-employed is in place until September and eligible businesses will continue to benefit from business rates relief of 75% over the year, VAT cuts and the Recovery Loan Scheme."" Event and wedding planning studio founder Matthew Shaw is concerned about how his industry and suppliers will cope with continued restrictions Wedding venues and planners have told the BBC that the government's announcement about unlimited guest numbers being permitted has provided some relief, but they are still deeply worried about the future of their industry. Matthew Shaw, founder and creative director at Sauveur, a creative events and luxury wedding planning studio in London, has already been on the phone to his clients, who are confused about what they are allowed to do at their weddings. Many are upset about the fact they cannot have a dance floor indoors and they want to cancel the bands they have booked, Matthew says, which puts pressure on the suppliers Sauveur works with. ""Dance floors and drinks receptions are the things people want,"" he tells the BBC. ""It's great to have a meal, to be with people, but when you take away the key elements of what make a wedding special...people don't want to spend the money on it anymore."" Earlier this year, his marquee supplier went under. That means he will have to try to forge relationships with new suppliers, while hoping the existing ones are still coping and are resilient when clients pull the plug or decide to postpone their events. Sarah Callander Beckett, owner of wedding venue Combermere Abbey in Cheshire, says it could be difficult if couples all want to defer their weddings again Mr Shaw says that the last year has taken a toll on his mental health and that of his staff, clients and suppliers: ""I've spent sleepless nights wondering whether events will still be able to run, and whether we will still be able to get new clients, after watching new and existing clients drop away."" Sarah Callander Beckett, owner of wedding venue Combermere Abbey in Cheshire, agrees with Mr Shaw. They say some clients might prefer to defer their weddings again. But this creates an additional headache as the calendar for the rest of this year and into next year is already pretty packed for many businesses in the industry. ""These are some difficult decisions we'll have to facilitate as a business in the next few days managing expectations and emotions,"" Ms Beckett says. ""Ideally what we want to see is also the return of dancing and mingling amongst guests."" Keith Marsden is the landlord of the Prince of Wales pub in Moseley, Birmingham. Prince of Wales pub landlord Keith Marsden says the pub industry cannot continue to survive at only a third of its capacity He says that social distancing has proved a significant challenge and a continuation of restrictions will deeply impact his bottom line. Mr Marsden recently had his worst day of trading since he started the business, with takings of just Â£96. ""With social distancing whether you're inside or outside, you just cannot get the capacity,"" he says. ""We're operating at about one-third of our capacity, so we just cannot do the numbers to make a profit."" He says that people have fallen out of the habit of going to the pub: ""We're hanging in there but we're in serious trouble. ""It really will be the final nail in the coffin for many."" He's also worried about the financial challenges ahead, and the debt that he and others in the industry have built up. ""If you come in here on a busy weekend you think, oh yeah they're doing quite nicely, but beneath the surface there's lots of problems lurking,"" says Mr Marsden. ""People haven't aggressively chased debt, landlords have let people off with rent, business rates holidays, things like that. They're now coming to the surface."" Caterers for the festival and events industry say the delays in relaxing Covid restrictions is ""devastating"" for the sector The Nationwide Caterers Association (NCASS), which represents caterers in the festival and events sectors, including mobile and street food businesses, is also calling on the government to provide immediate financial support. ""Festival caterers will still not be able to work after already losing the 2020 season - it is devastating for the sector as a whole,"" the industry body's director Mark Laurie says. ""There are ten of thousands of businesses involved in the festival industry who are going to suffer huge losses."" Latest research from Live, the trade body for the UK live events sector, suggests the industry faces losses of more than Â£500m as at least 5,000 shows will be cancelled. ""Any delay to the 21 June reopening date will have significant and immediate repercussions, including 248 grassroots music venues that would face an immediate threat of eviction without a comprehensive response from the government that fully addresses their financial losses from delayed reopening,"" the trade body has warned. Mr Laurie says that caterers have had ""little to no help"" from the government or local authorities: ""The Additional Restrictions Grants (ARG) for those without fixed premises won't work to support theses businesses and so that must be addressed. ""NCASS is calling on the government to publish the results of the Events Research Programme, to provide immediate financial support to affected businesses and provide a clear way forward."" It is a terrible three-way balancing act - a race not just between the vaccine and the variant, but also viability of thousands of businesses. A cost-benefit analysis without many benefits. The signalling of 21 June as ""freedom day"" was meant to give businesses long-term confidence to plan staffing, stocking and reversing the mothballing of their hospitality venues. Indoor venues will incur substantial losses over the next month. The message from the government is that the support package they put in place at the Budget already accounted for this eventuality. The furlough scheme has begun a slow phase-out, whereas in many other similar countries, employer contributions are already required, or the schemes have ended. Ministers also point at the strength of the economic bounce-back and record hiring and vacancy statistics. But that will come as little comfort to industries now shut for 15 months, such as nightclubs. Local authorities have yet to allocate Â£1bn, about half of the discretionary fund. The ideal picture, as the prime minister put it, is that they will not be rolling back any of the currently implemented roadmap. As we know, the impact on the economy comes not just from mandatory lockdowns, but from voluntary social distancing as consumers stay away from crowded places if they feel the virus is out of control. On two crucial occasions last March and last Autumn, the government chose to prioritise economic reopening, with consequences for the scale of the outbreak that followed, which in turn definitively failed to be of any benefit to the economy. This time it appears they are learning a lesson from recent history, and proceeding cautiously. The calculation is that the immediate extra economic pain will be outweighed by fewer deaths and a confident irreversible reopening in a month's time.

"Clubbers will have to wait that bit longer for their post-pandemic blow out With news the 21 June ""freedom day"" will bedelayed for at least four weeks, club owners and festival organisers share their thoughts. Nightclubs are one of the last businesses to open One minute past midnight on 21 June was when Kasbah nightclub in Coventry was planning to make a triumphant return after the pandemic. The sold-out event promised to be the ultimate party after 16 months of upheaval - and manager Sam El Naqib is still hopeful it will go ahead a few weeks later. ""[With the] new Delta variant that has come around what we do have to do is ensure people's safety, because we're talking about full restrictions lifting in venues,"" he said. ""In nightclubs people like to get very up close and personal and enjoy themselves - singing, dancing, shouting. You can't really be doing that with restrictions in place or with any risk of this new variant we've got. ""We just have to bide our time until it's safe for everybody to come out and enjoy themselves again. ""We'll have to move a lot of events. We had a whole bunch of things planned for the end of June, the start of July, and it's a case of rescheduling everything until it's safe to be open again. ""[Young people have] been having to stay away from these kinds of places for 15 or 16 months now, so they were literally clamouring to come out and enjoy themselves again."" Extra testing is taking place in Leek after cases of the Delta variant were detected Many festivals have been cancelled for two years running - with Leek Arts Festival among them. But with increased testing being carried out in the Staffordshire town from Monday after an increase in numbers testing positive for the Delta variant, organisers have said they are unsurprised by the announcement. Phil Edmeades, spokesperson for Leek Arts Festival, said he never saw ""any chance of having, what's being described as 'freedom day' on June 21st, it was always going to be a fluid date"". ""If the science says it's not yet safe to have that freedom day then delay it,"" he added. ""That will disappoint a lot of people, myself included, but on the other hand there's no point getting upset about it there's no point getting angry about it - it is what it is. ""I do feel very sorry for those with businesses who are going to be affected by this situation but there's very little anyone can do about it."" Amy Seton was hoping to hold events at her whisky bar again Amy Seton, owner of whisky club Grain & Glass, in Birmingham city centre, said it was the lack of communication and the moving of the goalposts which had been frustrating. ""We take the [Covid] regulations very seriously,"" she said. ""But this [the delay] feels like one more thing on top of everything else."" She said she and her team, based in the Jewellery Quarter, had been sceptical about the 21 June to begin with, but then, as various restrictions were lifted, they threw themselves into organising a full opening for the 21st. They are fully booked from that date throughout the summer. ""We do events and large bookings and particularly stag parties. We have had loads of bookings as everyone thought the restrictions would be lifted."" Ms Seton said she and her team would now contact everyone who had booked to see if they wanted to cancel or rebook. ""All the work we have put in so far, and now we have to sit down and work it out again,"" she said. Lisa Baldwin said she had seen what Covid could do Lisa Baldwin has been suffering from long Covid symptoms - and welcomes not easing coronavirus rules. The mother-of-three, 46, from Birmingham, tested positive in October and said her liver had been affected. She added she had joint and muscle issues and her memory was ""really poor"". The education worker said: ""If I walk to the end of the street and back, it's a four/five minute walk, but on the way back I'll often stop four or five times."" Ms Baldwin said it was ""the right decision"" to delay. She added: ""I think a month is good because there was talk of two weeks. I think by saying at least a month, I think that sends a signal out to people. ""I've known people that have died through Covid and it's affected my life a lot. I haven't been able to go to work. I miss that lots. I think people just need to realise the implications that long Covid has."" Follow BBC West Midlands onFacebook,external,Twitter,externalandInstagram,external.

"Nightclubs have been closed for more than 15 months Delaying lockdown easing could have a ""critical impact"" on already struggling businesses and cost UK hospitality Â£3bn in lost sales, industry groups say. The government is expected to say that current coronavirus rules willremain in place for another four weeksafter the planned 21 June unlocking. Capacity limits will remain in pubs and cinemas and nightclubs will stay shut. Junior Health Minister Ed Argar said he expected there to be more aid to help businesses cope. Kate Harl said her restaurant, the Bean Inn in St Ives, Cornwall, would be operating at a ""greatly reduced capacity"" due to the delay and her ability to earn would be ""severely restricted"". ""For us the number of covers that we will be doing each night will be down by about 40%,"" she told the BBC's Today programme. ""It feels like we're treading water at the moment. We're not able to progress and make a decent profit. We're not at risk of going under, but it's very very difficult and challenging to go forward."" 'We're in serious trouble,' says hospitality sector 'We'll lose thousands if wedding rules don't change' Lockdown easing in England to be delayed Ministers are concerned about the spread of the Delta variant of coronavirus, now the most prevalent in the UK, which is around 60% more transmissible than the Alpha variant first identified in Kent. UK Hospitality, which represents pubs, bars and restaurants, said it recognised the government had a balance to strike, but it said many businesses were already deeply in debt and called for greater levels of government support. Many restaurants are currently operating at a reduced capacity ""Even now, with partial reopening, sector sales remain down 42% and 300,000 jobs remain protected by furlough,"" said boss Kate Nicholls. ""A one-month delay to restrictions lifting would cost the sector around Â£3bn in sales - but would also have a knock-on impact on bookings throughout the summer and into the autumn."" The Night Time Industries Association, which represents nightclubs among other venues, said businesses had been waiting to open for more than 15 months and many had made financial commitments ahead of 21 June. It said 54% of businesses it surveyed had ordered stock, 73% had called in staff and 60% had sold tickets. The trade group says it will legally challenge any delay, arguing that levels of mortality, hospitalisation and infection are still relatively low. ""To delay would have a huge impact on the sector, losing many businesses [and] livelihoods culminating in further loss of confidence in the sector,"" said chief executive Michael Kill. ""We will see many more illegal unregulated events take the place of businesses that are licensed and regulated across the country as people express their frustration,"" he added. Anton Stevens said he ""new something wasn't right"" after news about the lockdown being prolonged was leaked to the media Anton Stevens, director of the Hidden Nightclub in Manchester, said further delays to lifting the lockdown restrictions was ""the last thing we need really"". Mr Stevens said he and colleagues were hopeful that the 21 June opening day was ""on track"". ""Any question of the variants being a deciding factor in delaying the 21 June plans were quashed by the PM only last month and the rise of new cases seemed a formality as the vaccination plan seemed to be working as expected,"" he said. Mr Stevens said his team added more air conditioning units, toilets and washrooms to ""reopen safely"". ""We've hired and trained new staff, a new security company and agreed plans for stock,"" he added. ""There's obviously a cost for all of this work which was needed to reopen safely and we're not going to see any return on the thousands of pounds invested for an extended period, with no mention of a another support package."" The Treasury has said eligible businesses will continue to benefit from business rates relief, VAT reduction and the Recovery Loan Scheme. The furlough scheme and support for the self-employed is in place until September. But business groups want the chancellor to go further. The British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) said business support measures should reflect the level of restrictions announced and remain in place until the economy is able to reopen fully. ""We would be calling for the government to provide further cash grants, at least equivalent to levels provided during the first lockdown, and to delay the tapering of government payments into the furlough scheme, planned for the start of July,"" said BCC co-executive director Claire Walker. ""The government should also look at extending the trade credit reinsurance scheme beyond the end of June to minimise possible disruptions in insurance coverage."" Junior Health Minister Ed Argar told Sky News: ""I know that when [the prime minister] addresses his decision, sets out what he intends to do around the easing on the 21st, he will address those points as well. ""He is very mindful of the need for businesses and others to get the support they need if they continue to be locked down or unable to open."" A Treasury spokesperson said it was ""committed to helping businesses and individuals through the pandemic and deliberately went long with our support to provide certainty over the summer"". ""The furlough scheme and support for the self employed is in place until September and eligible businesses will continue to benefit from business rates relief, VAT reduction and the Recovery Loan Scheme,"" they added.

"This video can not be played Londonâs Cuckoo Club 'facing extinction' after lockdown easing delay Live music, theatre and other events have been dealt a ""hammer blow"" by a four-week delay to the final stage of easing lockdown restrictions in England, industry figures have said. The move means the capacity of venues will remain limited by the requirements around social distancing. The entertainment sector has appealed for urgent financial support. The Society of London Theatre said the decision would ""have serious implications for many theatres"". And the Night Time Industries Association said the PM had ""switched the lights off for an entire sector"". Boris Johnsontold a press conference on Mondaythe delay to lifting most remaining curbs on social contact was necessary to avoid ""a real possibility that the virus will outrun the vaccines and that thousands more deaths would ensue which could otherwise have been avoided"". Lockdown easing in England to be delayed One week notice 'not enough' for nightlife delay What are the lockdown rules we still have to live with? What will delaying the full unlock achieve? The government's planned date for lifting restrictions - 21 June - has now been pushed back until 19 July, amid rising Covid cases driven by the more transmissible Delta variant. But the prime minister said there would be a review after two weeks and he was ""confident"" the delay would not need to be longer than four weeks. Fans recently attended a West End performance titled The Show Must Go On Many in the entertainment industry said they understood the need for the delay, but called for further government support. Mark Davyd, chief executive of the Music Venues Trust, said the government should take ""swift and robust"" action to prevent hundreds of potential grassroots music venue closures. He said this should include ""getting financial support to people who desperately need it, extending repayment options for loans, cancelling business rates and extending support schemes such as furlough and SEISS [the self-employment income support scheme]"". The Society of London Theatre and UK Theatre said there were ""thousands of jobs hanging in the balance"" as producers make the ""difficult decision"" of whether to start rehearsals for shows that are due to open later this summer. ""Particularly at risk are large-scale commercial productions, which have received little or no Cultural Recovery Fund support and cannot survive under social distancing,"" a statement said. Trafalgar Entertainment's Sir Howard Panter and Dame Rosemary Squire, who have two major musicals due to open in London in late July, said the delay was ""yet another bungle"" from the government. ""The confusion and muddled messages are reminiscent of a West End farce,"" they said in a statement. Meanwhile, UK Cinema Association said it was ""mindful of the rationale behind today's decision"" and acknowledged many cinemas ""can still operate viably at below full occupancy"", but that they would ""continue to face significant challenges as they look to recover from the enormous financial impacts of Covid"". Lucy Noble, chair of the National Arenas Association, said the delay was ""devastating"", while trade association Live said the industry had been left ""in limbo"". Sir Ian McKellen, who is due to star in Hamlet from 21 June, said the fact theatres cannot play to full houses was ""very, very frustrating"". ""Thank goodness I'm not the producer, who must be wondering what to do, because you sold an awful lot of tickets and people may have to shift to other dates,"" he told the BBC's The One Show. ""I think they were warned in advance that might happen. ""It's a lot of trouble, but there's no doubt, a week today, we open up Hamlet at the Theatre Royal Windsor as planned, but it will be social distancing for a little bit longer than we'd hoped."" Andrew Lloyd Webber has pledged to open Cinderella at the Gillian Lynne Theatre in London However, there could be hope for some in the sector as fifteen coronavirus pilot events are to continue as planned before 19 July, including some arts and music performances. On Monday, the PM suggested Andrew Lloyd Webber's new musical Cinderella may be able to join the scheme, after the composer saidhe was prepared to be arrestedif he couldn't open as planned on 25 June. ""I think we're in talks to with him to try to make it work and we'll do whatever we can to be helpful,"" the prime minister said. But that came as a surprise to Lord Lloyd-Webber. ""My goal is, and will always be, to fight for the full and safe reopening of theatre and live music venues up and down the country,"" he said. ""I was pleased and surprised to hear the prime minister mention Cinderella as part of his announcement today, but I can't comment further on the proposed pilot until I know more about the scheme."" A string of music festivals planned for June and July were cancelled or postponed after Mr Johnson's announcement. They included the Black Deer festival in Kent, which was due to be headlined by Van Morrison at the end of June. Organisers of the Noisily Festival in Leicestershirewrote in a statement,external: ""After pouring our heart and soul into the event on a wing and a prayer - hoping against hope - to have all of that dashed again is beyond devastating."" Alex Hutchinson, who runs the Kubix festival in Sunderland, said his event would no longer take place in early July. ""I think people forget there are millions of people behind these closed industries, either directly or in the supply chains, who at the minute can't even give a definite date to be able to resume making a living,"" he told BBC Radio 5 Live. A government spokesperson said: ""We understand a delay to full reopening is challenging for live events, and we will be helping our creative industries through it. We have made Â£2bn available through the biggest arts funding package in history and the final funding round of Â£300m will be announced shortly. ""Clubs and venues have also benefited from restart grants worth Â£18,000 each, and there's nearly Â£1bn available in further discretionary grants local authorities still have to pay out.

"There will be no limit on the number of people allowed to attend weddings, civil partnerships and receptions in England from 19 July. Rules will also ease in Scotland on that date. From 19 July,there will be no limits on the number of people who can attend services or receptions,external, whatever the venue. Current rules about social distancing and face coverings will no longer apply, there will be no requirement for table service, and restrictions around singing and dancing will also end. At the moment, any number of guests can attend a wedding ceremony or reception held outside, or in a Covid-secure public venue. Venues must comply with social distancing rules, which limit guest numbers Venues must provide table service Dancing and singing are restricted Face coverings must be worn indoors by everyone over the age of 11 when not eating or drinking, unless they are exempt. This includes staff, but not the couple or the person officiating Weddings held in outdoors private settings - such as gardens - require a risk assessment to determine how many guests can be hosted safely. A marquee or other structure in a private garden must have at least half of its walled area open to be classed as ""outdoors"". Weddings in private homes can only take place with six people or two households present, unless one of those getting married is seriously ill, in which case 30 people can attend. How could life change on 19 July? Official guidance for wedding and civil partnerships,external Official guidance for places of worship,external The maximum limit of who can attend wedding and civil partnership ceremonies and receptions depends on the Covid level. Level two restriction area,external- up to 50 Level one,external- up to 100 Level zero,external- up to 200 First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has saidthe whole country will move to level 0 on 19 July, meaningup to 200 guests can attend a wedding,external. The actual permitted number of guests for a particular event will still depend on the size of the venue. The marrying couple and witnesses are included in this number, but people working at the wedding are not. There will be no need to socially distance outdoors: dancing, standing drinks/canapÃ© receptions and receiving lines can resume at weddings outdoors only You should avoid dancing or mingling indoors at wedding receptions Physical distancing will be fixed at 1m (3ft) indoors for ceremonies and receptions in all venues Alcohol can be served until 24:00 Guests will still have to wear masks when not seated The government hopes that more restrictions will be scrapped on 9 August, subject to a decision next month. The number of people who can attendwedding or civil partnership ceremonies or receptions,externalis determined by the size of the venue and a Covid risks assessment. The celebration must be organised by a business in a regulated venue, such as an hotel. Face coverings must be worn indoors by everyone aged 11 and over when not eating or drinking, unless they have a reasonable excuse. This does not apply to the married couple or the person officiating. Food and drink are permitted in line withhospitality guidance,external. There isno limit on the number of people at a wedding,external, but venues must assess how many they can safely accommodate. During the ceremony, face coverings must be worn by everyone (unless exempt), apart from the wedding couple and the person officiating. Receptions can take place, subject to the following rules: No restriction on the number of people at the top table, but no more than 10 people (not including children) at other tables You need to wear a mask when not seated The wedding couple can have one dance together, but guests cannot dance Live music is allowed at ""ambient levels"" Some rules aredue to change on 26 July, subject to approval on 22 July. Volume restrictions on live music will be removed and social distancing rules will be relaxed. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA)published guidance in September 2020,external: If your wedding couldn't go ahead without breaching lockdown rules, you're likely to be entitled to a refund and won't be liable for future payments Your refund may also cover a ''non-refundable'' deposit, although a venue or supplier can subtract ''limited'' costs for services already provided A venue may withhold money spent on your wedding that it could not recover, such as planning, but not for things like general staff costs Suppliers/venues must give you a cost breakdown if they wish to withhold part of your deposit Wedding insurance shouldn't affect your right to a refund, but you can't get your money back twice.

"This video can not be played PM Boris Johnson: ""Now is the time to ease off the accelerator"" The final stage of easing lockdown restrictions in England is to be delayed until 19 July. It means most remaining curbs on social contact will continue beyond 21 June, when they had been due to be lifted. The limit on wedding guest numbers will be removed but venues will still have to adhere to other rules. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said there would be a review after two weeks and he was ""confident"" the delay would not need to be longer than four weeks. However, he told a Downing Street press conference he could not rule out the possibility the date could be pushed back further. Scientists advising the government had warned of a ""significant resurgence"" in people needing hospital treatment for Covid-19 if stage four of easing the lockdown went ahead on 21 June. It comes amid rising cases, driven by the more transmissible Delta variant, which was first identified in India. What are the rules after 21 June? 'We're in serious trouble,' says hospitality sector What will delaying the full unlock achieve? How many people can go to a wedding and reception? Mr Johnson said going ahead with stage four on 21 June would mean ""a real possibility"" of the virus outrunning the vaccines, leading to thousands more deaths which could otherwise have been avoided. The delay would give the NHS ""a few more crucial weeks"" to get people vaccinated, he said, adding that while the link between infections and hospital admissions had been ""weakened"" it had not been ""severed"". ""We will monitor the position every day and if, after two weeks, we have concluded that the risk has diminished, then we reserve the possibility of proceeding to step four and a full opening sooner,"" he said. ""At a certain stage, we are going to have to learn to live with the virus and to manage it as best we can,"" he added. Addressing MPs in the Commons later, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the decision not to ease restrictions next week was being made with a ""heavy heart"" but the government's four tests for easing restrictions - one of which is that the risks are not fundamentally changed by new variants - had not been met. He said extra testing facilities and access to vaccines would be rolled out in more areas of the country, while vaccinations would be opened up on Tuesday in England to people aged 23 and 24. The number of guests at weddings and wakes will no longer be limited to 30 But venues will have to adhere to social distancing and hosts will have to do a risk assessment Table service will be required and no indoor dance floors allowed Care home residents will no-longer have to isolate for 14 days after returning from visits outside. Exceptions will include high-risk trips such as overnight hospital stays The delay means limits remain on how many people can meet, with groups of up to 30 allowed to meet outdoors and up to six people or two households allowed indoors. However, 15 coronavirus pilot events will continue as planned, including some upcoming Euro 2020 games,Wimbledonand arts and music performances. Attendees will have to show proof of vaccination or a recent negative test. Capacity limits will continue at other venues and nightclubs will stay closed. Advice to work from home where possible will remain in place. The extension of restrictions will be put to a Commons vote, which could trigger a sizeable Conservative backbench rebellion, with a debate expected on Wednesday. LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? SOCIAL DISTANCING:How can I meet my friend safely? FACE MASKS:When do I need to wear one? Mr Johnson said two-thirds of adults would have been offered two coronavirus jabs by 19 July, including all vulnerable groups. The gap between doses for over-40s in England will be reduced from 12 to eight weeks. And the target to offer all adults a first dose will be brought forward to 19 July. It comes as new analysis by Public Health England shows two doses of either the Pfizer or AstraZeneca vaccine are highly effective at preventing hospital admissions from the Delta variant. PHE said the effectiveness was comparable to against the Alpha variant which was previously dominant in the UK. The size of a future surge in infections is uncertain because questions remain about the Delta variant, vaccines and people's behaviour once rules are relaxed. The Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling (SPI-M) said a third wave could range from ""considerably smaller than January 2021 to considerably higher"". It said even a short delay to easing the restrictions would lead to a significant drop in the number of Covid patients in hospital as more people were vaccinated and the school holidays got closer, reducing transmission. Scientists have advised the government delaying by four weeks would reduce the peak in hospital admissions by between a third and a half. The government's chief scientific advisor Sir Patrick Vallance said there would still be an increase in numbers and an increase in hospitalisations ""because that's what happens when there's more mixing"". Labour's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said the public had been ""let down by ministerial incompetence and indecision"". ""The only reason this delay is being introduced is because the Conservatives failed to secure the country's borders and a new variant from overseas was allowed to take hold; and failed to put in measures like proper sick pay support and surge vaccinations when needed,"" he said. There are plenty of benefits to delaying the full unlock. More vaccinations will be done and the impact of this wave in terms of hospitalisations will be reduced. We could also see the rise in infections slow as the initial surge meets the wall of immunity already built up by the vaccination campaign. But make no mistake the coming weeks will see a real resurgence of Covid. Infection levels are already climbing steeply and modelling suggests there could be 1,000 hospital admissions a day by the middle of summer. That is the same number that the NHS would normally see for all types of respiratory illness in the depths of a bad winter. The proportion of people dying should be much much lower than it was in previous waves though thanks to the protective effect of vaccines. But the alternative would be a reintroduction of restrictions. It is a price worth paying, the government believes. The Night Time Industries Association said the delay to the roadmap was a ""devastating blow"" that would ""drive down confidence in the sector to a new low"", forcing more workers to leave the industry. Julian Bird, chief executive of the Society of London Theatre and UK Theatre, said thousands of jobs were ""hanging in the balance"", with venues no longer able to increase their capacity as planned. Reopening delay a 'hammer blow for live events' Businesses react to easing delay Many pubs and restaurants are also trading at a loss because of social distancing measures. Industry trade body UKHospitality called for additional financial support for affected businesses, saying the delay would cost the sector around Â£3bn in sales. The government has said it will not extend the furlough scheme or other financial support further, despite the delay to the unlocking roadmap. Under thefurlough scheme, the government covers up to 80% of an employee's salary for the hours they cannot work because of the pandemic. The scheme is due to run until the end of September but employers will have to help cover the cost from July. Some Tory MPs were also critical of the delay, with senior backbencher Sir Robert Neill saying a few weeks made ""the difference between survival or closure for some businesses"". The rise in cases in the UK is being driven by the Delta variant, first identified in India, which is believed to be around 60% more infectious than the previous dominant variant and twice as likely to result in hospital admissions. On Monday, the UK has recorded 7,742 new cases of Covid-19 and three deaths within 28 days of a positive test. The seven-day average for cases in the UK is up 46% compared with the seven days before. Plans for easing coronavirus restrictions differ between the four UK nations. All areas ofScotlandare due to move to Level Zero Covid restrictions on 28 June - meaning bigger groups can gather in cafes, pubs and restaurants, although they will still have to observe social distancing. Limits on indoor gatherings inNorthern Irelandare scheduled to be relaxed on 21 June and the rules inWaleswill be reviewed on 25 June. Are you affected by the delay to restrictions easing in England?

"JD Sports executive chairman Peter Cowgill The chairman of JD Sports has rejected criticism of a large bonus he received after the retailer benefited from millions of pounds in Covid support. Peter Cowgill told the BBC that the ""lion's share"" of the Â£4.3m bonus related to work done pre-January 2019. He also rejected suggestions the firm should repay furlough money. Shareholder advisory group Glass Lewis has urged investors in the sportswear chain to vote against what it calls an ""inappropriate"" pay policy. Shareholders will get a chance to vote at JD Sports' annual general meeting on 1 July, although this would not be binding. Mr Cowgill told the BBC's World at One programme that the pay boost in 2020 resulted from a long-term incentive share plan (Ltip), and that he had received only one payout from the scheme in the past eight years. ""Over that period the [firm's] profits went from Â£82m to Â£420m,"" he added. Mr Cowgill said the firm had correctly used the furlough scheme to support jobs, and should not volunteer to pay it back as rivals Primark and Asos have done. He said Primark was part of a larger firm, AB Foods, whose profits benefited from strong sales of food last year, while Asos was a pure online player which did not have the same overheads. JD Sports faces backlash over boss's Â£4.3m bonus Mr Cowgill said it was possible investors might vote against his pay package, but added: ""Why would you when the company has progressed, it's provided increasing levels of employment throughout? ""It's expanded internationally, it's created continued growth."" As a non-essential retailer, JD Sports' shops were closed for long periods during the pandemic and the firm received Â£61m through the UK furlough scheme and an estimated Â£38m in business rates relief. It has also benefitted from an additional Â£25m in wage support from other countries where it operates. JD Sports was also provisionally granted an emergency Â£300m loan from the Bank of England, although the company points out that it was, in the end, not needed and never accessed. At the same time, the chain saw its revenues rise in 0.9% last year to Â£6.1bn as its sales shifted online, although its pre-tax profits fell 7%. Mr Cowgill's bonus was agreed in January 2019 and several instalments were deferred due to the pandemic, then subsequently paid. Taking this into account, he said his bonus last year was actually Â£1.3m - down 75% on the previous year.

"Boris Johnson confirms a four-week delay to the lifting of all restrictions in England beyond 21 June The new date for lifting the restrictions has now been set at 19 July The PM says he is 'confident' the delay will not need to be longer than four weeks Capacity limits for sports, pubs and cinemas will remain, and nightclubs will remain closed The number of guests at weddings and wakes will no longer be limited to 30, but restrictions on these events will remain The delay is designed to allow more people to be vaccinated and have second doses amid rising cases of the Delta variant Cases are growing by about 64% per week and in the worst affected areas are doubling each week By 19 July 'we will aim to have double jabbed two-thirds of the adult population', says the PM Businesses are fearful of further heavy losses and the clubbing trade body is threatening legal action Headache, sore throat, runny nose are now the most commonly reported symptoms linked to Covid infection in the UK, researchers say India has reported 70,421 new infections - its lowest number since 31 March and down from a peak of about 400,000 daily cases in May We're going to bring our live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic to an end now. We'll be back on Tuesday morning. The page was written by Alexandra FouchÃ©, Emma Harrison, Alex Kleiderman, Jen Meierhans, Lauren Turner, Sinead Wilson and George Wright, and edited by Claire Heald. And the key developments in the UK:  We're bringing our live coverage to a close shortly but before we go here is what has been happening around the world: Theatres and cinemas have reacted with disappointment to the confirmation that they will not be able to welcome full capacity audiences back to venues in England on 21 June. Julian Bird, who heads the Society of London
Theatre-UK Theatre industry group, urged the government to provide more financial support to the sector, saying its decision will
have ""serious implications"". ""This delay not only impacts productions and theatres
preparing to open in the next few weeks, but also shows currently running
socially distanced, which had planned to increase their capacity - and
producers making the difficult decision whether to start rehearsals for shows
due to open in late July or August,"" he said. His call was echoed by the UK Cinema Association, which said in a statement: ""While mindful of the rationale behind todayâs decision... many of its members will continue to face significant challenges as they look to recover from the enormous financial impacts of Covid"". Planning on going to a
fesival or this summer? Or to see your favourite band? Covid rules for gigs will
now remain in place - and nightclubs will stay shut - until 19 July. You can go to an event at
the moment - but only if organisers limit attendance and ensure social
distancing. One-thousand people inside
(4,000 outside) or 50% of a venueâs capacity - whichever is lower - can
currently attend a gig in England. Rules vary across the UK -
take a lookat our comprehensive guide.  The rules on weddings and
civil partnerships in England are being relaxed from 21 June. The current limit of 30
people at a ceremony or reception will be lifted. However, social distancing
and face coverings will be needed. Before you buy your new
hat -read our updated explainer. Reality Check Boris Johnson says that the link
between Covid infection and hospitalisation has been âweakenedâ but not
âseveredâ. The hospitalisation rate is a key
measure of how effective the vaccination programme is. Analysis from Public Health England
suggests that - when it comes to the Delta variant first identified in
India - two doses of Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is
96% effective against hospitalisation, while two doses of Oxford-AstraZeneca is
92% effective. The hospitalisation rate measures the
proportion of people testing positive for coronavirus who end up being admitted
to hospital. There is a delay in the figures - the
data for infections is backdated seven days from the start of each month to
allow for the infections to take their course. The rate has fallen from about 10%
in February to about 5% in May. If you look at the most recent week for
which we have figures, which is the week to 8 June, the hospitalisation rate
has dropped below 4%. However, Englandâs Chief Medical
Officer, Prof Chris Whitty, has cautioned that: âThe hospitalisations are
following, but with a delay, the number of cases."" Shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth tells Radio 5 Live the delay will ""come as a massive blow"" to business but ""we are in this state because Boris Johnson failed to protect our borders"". The borders were  ""as weak as a sieve"" he says and that let the delta variant in to the country. Labour will support the restrictions ""with a heavy heart"" he says but we must be clear that the virus is surging because the PM ""left the back door open and allowed the variant to wash up on our shores"". Chris MasonPolitical Correspondent Earlier this afternoon, I joined a government briefing call to help understand the detail about what we have just heard in the news conference. Here are a handful of things that caught my eye - and the reaction they are provoking: Joe Murphy of the Evening Standard asks Sir Patrick if he would be relaxed if infections went back to January levels? ""How high would they have to go before you called the PM and say 'look maybe it is time to slow things down again?'"" he asks. Sir Patrick says: ""Realistically if we ever got a very very large wave there would be a very large number of people in hospital but the plan and the vaccination programme is designed precisely to stop that from occurring."" Murphy points out only 36% of Londoners have had second doses of coronavirus vaccine. He asks Prof Whitty how worried he is about this and what he will do to improve the situation? Prof Whitty says: ""On London, let's start with the glass half full, Londoners as in the rest of the UK have shown great enthusiasm for the vaccine. Overall the rates are higher than many countries would really dream of having at this point in time."" But he says they are behind other areas by about 10%. He says: ""You are completely right we do need to concentrate... and find the areas with the lowest rates and really push to get them up whatever the reasons are."" He asks the PM if he envisages nightclubs reopening and dispensing with masks and social distancing on what will be hailed the new Freedom Day on 19 July. The PM replies there are many businesses that need to move beyond social distancing and people are yearning to get back to that so I'm determined to be able to do that by 19 July. But to achieve an irreversible roadmap you have to be cautious, he says. And that brings the press conference to a close. Jessica ParkerBBC political correspondent Some good news for couples who are about to get married, but
with significant caveats. From 21 June, the limit of 30 at
weddings will be lifted. Technically thereâll be no cap on numbers. However, in
practice there will be. Venues will have to obey social distancing rules, with
table service. Downing Street has also said that there should not be dance floors. The prime minister acknowledged it will mean that weddings wonât be quite as
many hoped, apologising for the disappointment. Jim Pickard from the FT asks about summer holidays and the confusion he thinks many people feel about the advice from the government. The PM says the most important thing is to follow the red, amber, green guidance and there is not much more he can add at this stage. He then turns to furlough and says the plan was always to make sure it could continue until September. He says he doesn't think the rules on that will need to be changed based on vaccine efficacy and what he can see now in the data. James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News Scientists have advised ministers that a four-week delay to
Step 4 would reduce the peak in hospital admissions by between a third and a
half. Teams at Warwick University, the London School of Hygiene
and Tropical Medicine and Imperial College London have crunched the numbers. All anticipate a âsignificant resurgenceâ in people needing
hospital treatment if Step 4 goes ahead on 21 June. However, the size of that surge is wracked with uncertainty
as there are still questions about the delta variant, vaccines and our
behaviour once the rules are relaxed. As a result, SPI-M, the group of disease modellers that
feeds advice into government, says the size of the third wave âranges from
considerably smaller than January 2021 to considerably higherâ. But it anticipates even a short delay would lead to a
âsignificant dropâ in the number of Covid patients in hospital as âmore people
are vaccinated and as the school summer holidays get closerâ. Jason Groves at the Daily Mail asks Prof Whitty if he is as confident as the PM that 19 July will be the end of all restrictions in England. He asks the PM if he can give a ""cast iron guarantee that this will be the last delay"" provided no new variants of concern turn up. He asks if Andrew Lloyd Webber and other in the theatre industry factor into the PM's calculations on the delay. The PM says everyone is ""heartbroken"" at the impact on theatres and says he is in talks with Lloyd Webber over his latest production of Cinderella ""to try and make it work"". ""On the basis of what we can currently see I'm confident 19 July will be a terminal date not a 'not before' date,"" Johnson says. Prof Whitty says: ""I completely agree with the prime minister's answer and I'm sure Prof Valance would as well."" Tom Harwood  from GB News asks about the plan for booster jabs in the autumn. Can the media see the plan and when will the jabs actually go in to arms? The PM says we are seeing a surge in infections now and we must be realistic that people will very sadly continue to lose their lives so a booster plan will be set out very soon. The health secretary will come forward with a plan, he says. Sir Patrick says the plan at the moment is to get 18-year-olds and over vaccinated with the Pfizer and Moderna jab soon. The vaccines really are spectacularly effective, he adds. Carl Dinnen at ITV News asks the PM: ""Some of the support in place for business starts to reduce during this four-week delay, why aren't you keeping support and protections in place it at the level they are now?"" He asks Prof Whitty if we did not have this delay what does the modelling say is the worst that could happen to the NHS? Johnson says ""we are not going backwards"" and all the support measures are intended to last through to September. In terms of business rates local authorities have an extra Â£1bn to cover those who need it. He says the 21 June was always a not before date and realistically it'll be more like an extra four weeks rather than two. Prof Whitty says: ""Whatever rate we are seeing now would be significantly increased because it would see more mixing of households indoors."" Sir Patrick says: ""The four-week delay should reduce the peak, whatever it would be, by something between 30 and 50%... and actually it's not very obvious that you get much more gain from going on any longer than that."" Englandâs lockdown rules
wonât change as hoped on 21 June, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has confirmed. It means remaining
restrictions - affecting things like clubbing, festivals and capacity in pubs
and restaurants - will stay in place until at least 19 July. It also means that the
limits on how many people you can have in your home wonât be lifted. Thatâs six
people or two households indoors. Up to 30 can meet outside. Read our explainerto see
what you can and canât do. The BBC's Laura Kuenssberg asks if the PM will rule out any further delay to lifting the restrictions after this one. The PM says at a certain stage we are going to have to learn to live with the virus and manage it as best we can. The current delay is to try to reduce this current stage he says and bring down the overall levels of deaths. By 19 July, he says we will have built up a very substantial ""wall of immunity"" in the population but he has to be honest with people, there could be a new variant that we cannot foresee at this stage. We will be in a much better position in July to go forward as a country, he says. Twice-postponed bride Tessa in Bedfordhire asks why testing and vaccination status cannot be used to open up weddings as they are for football matches. She says she feels like weddings are the bottom of the priority list despite them being significant life events without which some people cannot progress with their lives. The PM says he is very sorry to hear that her wedding plans have been postponed twice. Johnson says he hopes it is of practical consolation to her that from 21 June weddings will be able go ahead with more than 30 people providing social distancing is observed. Andrew in Worthing asks the first question from the public. Is there a plan to prioritise vaccinating university students he wants to know? The PM says 23 to 24-year-olds can start coming forward for jabs. He says the government is going as fast as it can and will look at what it can do to accelerate things.  Â© 2025 BBC.

"This video can not be played Arlene Foster makes her final speech to the Northern Ireland Assembly as first minister Arlene Foster has urged Northern Ireland's political parties to stick to a language and cultural deal they agreed to in January 2020. Speaking in the Stormont assembly ahead of her resignation as first minister on Monday, Mrs Foster said the deal was ""the only model for success"". Sinn FÃ©in leader Mary Lou McDonald said the UK government had to move a law on Irish language through Westminster. The issue has long been a sticking point for Stormont's political parties. Mrs Foster's departure as first minister came six weeksafter she was ousted as Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader. In her statement to the assembly, she also said she would continue to speak up for women in public life. When Mrs Foster resigned, Sinn FÃ©in's Michelle O'Neill also lost her position as deputy first minister because the roles are a joint office. Arlene Foster spoke to Michelle O'Neill shortly before she delivered her resignation speech at Stormont There is now a seven-day period for the approval of a new first minister and deputy first minister by the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in. Sinn FÃ©in has suggested it may not support a new DUP first minister unless legislation on the Irish language is approved by ministers before 10 July. Arlene Foster: From trailblazing leader to party civil war Politicians pay tribute to Arlene Foster's service Mrs Foster said parties should support the deal on culture - which included language legislation - inthe New Decade, New Approach deal, which restored devolution to Northern Ireland in January 2020. She said: ""My team and I sought and secured a cultural package that would see a range of measures to advance identities and protect them for future generations. ""This is the only model for success - not one step forward for some and one step back for others."" The deal included an Office of Identity and Cultural Expression, an Irish language commissioner and a commissioner to enhance and develop the language and culture of the Ulster-Scots/Ulster-British tradition. Mary Lou McDonald says the UK and Irish governments should intervene in the row over Irish language legislation On Monday morning Edwin Poots, who replaced Mrs Foster as DUP leader last month, said he intended to support Irish language legislationbut not necessarily before the next assembly electionin May 2022. Speaking after a Sinn FÃ©in meeting with the UK government on Monday evening, Ms McDonald said her party would have preferred the legislation to be delivered through the Stormont as agreed. She said Sinn FÃ©in had ""engaged intensively"" with Mr Poots and his party. ""He has told us that they will not be delivering [the legislation] during the existing assembly mandate,"" she said. ""It is now incumbent on the British and Irish governments to act."" Speaking in the assembly, Mrs Foster said she would now spend more time with her family ""whether they like it or not"". ""It's just as well, Mr Speaker, I am such a good daughter, wife and mother,"" she added,in an apparent reference to Mr Poots' statement in 2016 when Mrs Foster became first ministerthat her ""most important job"" remained ""that of a wife, mother and daughter"". Mrs Foster said she had unfinished business to ensure Northern Ireland succeeded in its new century. This video can not be played Arlene Foster: ""It is only by respecting each other's identity that we will move forward."" ""I will contribute in whatever way I can to see Northern Ireland advance politically, socially, economically and culturally as part of the UK,"" she said. ""Strong, functioning devolution is vital to this."" She also called for changes tothe Northern Ireland Protocol- the part of the Brexit deal which keeps Northern Ireland within the EU single market for goods - which she said had thrown relations between the UK and Ireland and the UK and EU ""out of balance"". She said: ""If Brussels continues to think the protocol is enough, they are in denial. ""Imbalance and instability in the context of Northern Ireland is a truly dangerous cocktail. ""Northern Ireland is part of the United Kingdom and needs to be treated as such."" She didn't sing this time but she used a joke comparing her final speech to Father Ted Crilly's at the Golden Clerics. It wasn't that - for a start there were very few barbs, although Edwin Poots was probably the target when she talked about being a better wife and mother. On the issue which now threatens the existence of devolution - language - she praised the cultural package in the New Decade, New Approach Agreement, saying a step forward for one was a step backwards for others. And she took a final swipe at the Northern Ireland Protocol saying ""Northern Ireland is part of the UK and needs to be treated as such"", accusing Brussels of being in denial. But that is now a problem for others. Mrs Foster, however, says she has ""unfinished business"", whatever that will be. Mrs Foster served as first minister from January 2016 to January 2017 - when the Northern Ireland Assembly collapsed - and again from January 2020. She stood down as DUP leader after an internal party revolt, with at least 22 assembly members (MLAs) and four MPs signing a letter of no confidence.

"This video can not be played Arlene Foster makes her final speech to the Northern Ireland Assembly as first minister Arlene Foster has urged Northern Ireland's political parties to stick to a language and cultural deal they agreed to in January 2020. Speaking in the Stormont assembly ahead of her resignation as first minister on Monday, Mrs Foster said the deal was ""the only model for success"". Sinn FÃ©in leader Mary Lou McDonald said the UK government had to move a law on Irish language through Westminster. The issue has long been a sticking point for Stormont's political parties. Mrs Foster's departure as first minister came six weeksafter she was ousted as Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader. In her statement to the assembly, she also said she would continue to speak up for women in public life. When Mrs Foster resigned, Sinn FÃ©in's Michelle O'Neill also lost her position as deputy first minister because the roles are a joint office. Arlene Foster spoke to Michelle O'Neill shortly before she delivered her resignation speech at Stormont There is now a seven-day period for the approval of a new first minister and deputy first minister by the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in. Sinn FÃ©in has suggested it may not support a new DUP first minister unless legislation on the Irish language is approved by ministers before 10 July. Arlene Foster: From trailblazing leader to party civil war Politicians pay tribute to Arlene Foster's service Mrs Foster said parties should support the deal on culture - which included language legislation - inthe New Decade, New Approach deal, which restored devolution to Northern Ireland in January 2020. She said: ""My team and I sought and secured a cultural package that would see a range of measures to advance identities and protect them for future generations. ""This is the only model for success - not one step forward for some and one step back for others."" The deal included an Office of Identity and Cultural Expression, an Irish language commissioner and a commissioner to enhance and develop the language and culture of the Ulster-Scots/Ulster-British tradition. Mary Lou McDonald says the UK and Irish governments should intervene in the row over Irish language legislation On Monday morning Edwin Poots, who replaced Mrs Foster as DUP leader last month, said he intended to support Irish language legislationbut not necessarily before the next assembly electionin May 2022. Speaking after a Sinn FÃ©in meeting with the UK government on Monday evening, Ms McDonald said her party would have preferred the legislation to be delivered through the Stormont as agreed. She said Sinn FÃ©in had ""engaged intensively"" with Mr Poots and his party. ""He has told us that they will not be delivering [the legislation] during the existing assembly mandate,"" she said. ""It is now incumbent on the British and Irish governments to act."" Speaking in the assembly, Mrs Foster said she would now spend more time with her family ""whether they like it or not"". ""It's just as well, Mr Speaker, I am such a good daughter, wife and mother,"" she added,in an apparent reference to Mr Poots' statement in 2016 when Mrs Foster became first ministerthat her ""most important job"" remained ""that of a wife, mother and daughter"". Mrs Foster said she had unfinished business to ensure Northern Ireland succeeded in its new century. This video can not be played Arlene Foster: ""It is only by respecting each other's identity that we will move forward."" ""I will contribute in whatever way I can to see Northern Ireland advance politically, socially, economically and culturally as part of the UK,"" she said. ""Strong, functioning devolution is vital to this."" She also called for changes tothe Northern Ireland Protocol- the part of the Brexit deal which keeps Northern Ireland within the EU single market for goods - which she said had thrown relations between the UK and Ireland and the UK and EU ""out of balance"". She said: ""If Brussels continues to think the protocol is enough, they are in denial. ""Imbalance and instability in the context of Northern Ireland is a truly dangerous cocktail. ""Northern Ireland is part of the United Kingdom and needs to be treated as such."" She didn't sing this time but she used a joke comparing her final speech to Father Ted Crilly's at the Golden Clerics. It wasn't that - for a start there were very few barbs, although Edwin Poots was probably the target when she talked about being a better wife and mother. On the issue which now threatens the existence of devolution - language - she praised the cultural package in the New Decade, New Approach Agreement, saying a step forward for one was a step backwards for others. And she took a final swipe at the Northern Ireland Protocol saying ""Northern Ireland is part of the UK and needs to be treated as such"", accusing Brussels of being in denial. But that is now a problem for others. Mrs Foster, however, says she has ""unfinished business"", whatever that will be. Mrs Foster served as first minister from January 2016 to January 2017 - when the Northern Ireland Assembly collapsed - and again from January 2020. She stood down as DUP leader after an internal party revolt, with at least 22 assembly members (MLAs) and four MPs signing a letter of no confidence. Her departure prompted a series of resignations within the DUP,with several councillors and party members expressing their anger about how she was ousted.

"Nato has warned of China's military strength, but said it did not want a new Cold War with China Nato leaders meeting for a summit in Brussels have warned of the military threat posed by China, saying its behaviour is a ""systemic challenge"". China, they said, was rapidly expanding its nuclear arsenal, was ""opaque"" about its military modernisation and was co-operating militarily with Russia. Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg warned China was ""coming closer"" to Nato in military and technological terms. But he stressed the alliance did not want a new Cold War with China. Nato is a powerful political and military alliance between 30 European and North American countries. It was established after World War Two in response to the threat of communist expansion. Biden says America is back at the table Nato: US and Europe are safer standing together US imposes sanctions on Turkey over Russia weapons In a statement on Twitter,external, China's Mission to the EU accused Nato of ""slandering China's peaceful development"", and insisted that China was committed to a defence policy that is defensive in nature"". ""China will not present 'systematic challenges' to anyone, but we will not sit by and do nothing if 'systematic challenges' come closer to us,"" it added. In recent years, the Nato alliance came under strain as leaders debated its purpose and funding. Tensions grew during the presidency of Donald Trump, who complained about his country's financial contributions to the alliance and questioned the US commitment to defend European partners. President Joe Biden (R) spoke to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan at the summit It is his successor Joe Biden's first Nato meeting since taking office, and the new president has sought to reassert American backing for the 72-year-old alliance. Mr Biden said Nato was critically important for ""US interests"" and the alliance had a ""sacred obligation"" to observe Article 5 of its founding treaty, which commits members to defend each other from attack. Asked about his forthcoming summit with Vladimir Putin in Geneva on Wednesday, he described the Russian president as a ""worthy adversary"". This video can not be played Three things to watch as Joe Biden faces Vladimir Putin In another development, the Nato leaders also agreed to pay to keep Kabul airport running in Afghanistan, as the US and its allies withdraw troops from the country. Alliance member Turkey has offered to guard and operate the airport after troops leave. Joe Biden has been in his element during his first presidential trip abroad. The back-slapping veteran of the Senate foreign affairs committee set out to reassure US allies that American was ""back"", after a decidedly different set of priorities and personalities during the previous administration. US allies appeared to welcome the effort. French President Emmanuel Macron virtually glowed as he described Biden as ""part of the club"" that could deal with pressing issues like Covid and climate change. Macron's ""club"" reference prompted swipes from Donald Trump, who tried to paint Biden's G7 meetings as a return to the kind of business-as-usual mode that enriches the elite at the expense of working Americans. If Biden is to avoid such characterisation, he will have to mind how his foreign policy affects - and is perceived to affect - American pocketbooks. A renewed emphasis on multilateralism could put allies at ease, but it requires a sales job at home. Biden may rail against ""phony populism"", as he did at his Nato press conference, but if he wants to prevent a return of Trump and Trumpism, he will have to acknowledge the conditions that set the stage for its ascendance. His warm welcome from US allies might be gratifying, but it comes with domestic risk. According tothe summit's communiquÃ©,external(concluding statement), China's ""stated ambitions and assertive behaviour present systemic challenges to the rules-based international order and to areas relevant to Alliance security"". ""We remain concerned with China's frequent lack of transparency and use of disinformation,"" it says. Nato Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said the military alliance didn't want a Cold War with China Mr Stoltenberg told reporters: ""We're not entering a new Cold War and China is not our adversary, not our enemy."" But, he added, ""we need to address together, as the alliance, the challenges that the rise of China poses to our security"". China is one of the world's leading military and economic powers, whose ruling Communist Party has a tight grip on politics, daily life and much of society. The Chinese military currently has the largest armed forces in the world, with over two million personnel on active duty. Nato has become increasingly concerned about the growing military capabilities of China, which it sees as a threat to the security and democratic values of its members. In recent years, the alliance has also grown wary of China's activities in Africa, where it has established a military base in Djibouti. The North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, known as Nato, is the world's most powerful regional defence alliance It was set up in 1949, after World War Two, to counter the threat of communist expansion It was founded on the principle of collective defence between allies It originally had 12 members, but now has 30 Read more about Nato This video can not be played Nato explained in 80 seconds UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: ""When it comes to China, I don't think anybody around the table wants to descend into a new Cold War with China."" Nato's tough message on China followed criticism of the country by the G7, a group of major economies that met for a summit in England last week. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson arriving at the summit In a communiquÃ©G7 leaders criticised China for alleged human rights abusesand demanded a transparent investigation of the origins of Covid-19 in the country. In response, China accused the G7 of ""lies, rumours and baseless accusations"" in a statement through its embassy in the UK. The US leader famously said in an interview in March that he considered the Russian president to be a ""killer"", but on Monday he appeared to take a more conciliatory tone with regard to Mr Putin. This video can not be played Joe Biden said he hoped to cooperate with Vladimir Putin - and described him as ""a worthy adversary"" What Putin really wants from Biden Putin: Biden will be less impulsive than Trump ""He's bright,"" he said. ""He's tough. And I have found, as they say when I used to play ball, he's a worthy adversary."" A mural in support of jailed Russian dissident Alexei Navalny can be seen on a wall in Geneva But Mr Biden stressed that he would take a tough line on what the US regards as Russia's ""harmful activities"" such as alleged cyber-attacks. ""If he chooses not to co-operate and acts in the way he has in the past related to cyber-security and some other activities, we will respond,"" he said. ""We'll make it clear where the red lines are."" Correction 20th July 2021: An earlier version of this article reported that China has set up army bases in Africa and this has been amended to make clear that it has established one military base in Africa, at Djibouti.

"Nightclubs have been closed for more than 15 months Delaying lockdown easing could have a ""critical impact"" on already struggling businesses and cost UK hospitality Â£3bn in lost sales, industry groups say. The government is expected to say that current coronavirus rules willremain in place for another four weeksafter the planned 21 June unlocking. Capacity limits will remain in pubs and cinemas and nightclubs will stay shut. Junior Health Minister Ed Argar said he expected there to be more aid to help businesses cope. Kate Harl said her restaurant, the Bean Inn in St Ives, Cornwall, would be operating at a ""greatly reduced capacity"" due to the delay and her ability to earn would be ""severely restricted"". ""For us the number of covers that we will be doing each night will be down by about 40%,"" she told the BBC's Today programme. ""It feels like we're treading water at the moment. We're not able to progress and make a decent profit. We're not at risk of going under, but it's very very difficult and challenging to go forward."" 'We're in serious trouble,' says hospitality sector 'We'll lose thousands if wedding rules don't change' Lockdown easing in England to be delayed Ministers are concerned about the spread of the Delta variant of coronavirus, now the most prevalent in the UK, which is around 60% more transmissible than the Alpha variant first identified in Kent. UK Hospitality, which represents pubs, bars and restaurants, said it recognised the government had a balance to strike, but it said many businesses were already deeply in debt and called for greater levels of government support. Many restaurants are currently operating at a reduced capacity ""Even now, with partial reopening, sector sales remain down 42% and 300,000 jobs remain protected by furlough,"" said boss Kate Nicholls. ""A one-month delay to restrictions lifting would cost the sector around Â£3bn in sales - but would also have a knock-on impact on bookings throughout the summer and into the autumn."" The Night Time Industries Association, which represents nightclubs among other venues, said businesses had been waiting to open for more than 15 months and many had made financial commitments ahead of 21 June. It said 54% of businesses it surveyed had ordered stock, 73% had called in staff and 60% had sold tickets. The trade group says it will legally challenge any delay, arguing that levels of mortality, hospitalisation and infection are still relatively low. ""To delay would have a huge impact on the sector, losing many businesses [and] livelihoods culminating in further loss of confidence in the sector,"" said chief executive Michael Kill. ""We will see many more illegal unregulated events take the place of businesses that are licensed and regulated across the country as people express their frustration,"" he added. Anton Stevens said he ""new something wasn't right"" after news about the lockdown being prolonged was leaked to the media Anton Stevens, director of the Hidden Nightclub in Manchester, said further delays to lifting the lockdown restrictions was ""the last thing we need really"". Mr Stevens said he and colleagues were hopeful that the 21 June opening day was ""on track"". ""Any question of the variants being a deciding factor in delaying the 21 June plans were quashed by the PM only last month and the rise of new cases seemed a formality as the vaccination plan seemed to be working as expected,"" he said. Mr Stevens said his team added more air conditioning units, toilets and washrooms to ""reopen safely"". ""We've hired and trained new staff, a new security company and agreed plans for stock,"" he added. ""There's obviously a cost for all of this work which was needed to reopen safely and we're not going to see any return on the thousands of pounds invested for an extended period, with no mention of a another support package."" The Treasury has said eligible businesses will continue to benefit from business rates relief, VAT reduction and the Recovery Loan Scheme. The furlough scheme and support for the self-employed is in place until September. But business groups want the chancellor to go further. The British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) said business support measures should reflect the level of restrictions announced and remain in place until the economy is able to reopen fully. ""We would be calling for the government to provide further cash grants, at least equivalent to levels provided during the first lockdown, and to delay the tapering of government payments into the furlough scheme, planned for the start of July,"" said BCC co-executive director Claire Walker. ""The government should also look at extending the trade credit reinsurance scheme beyond the end of June to minimise possible disruptions in insurance coverage."" Junior Health Minister Ed Argar told Sky News: ""I know that when [the prime minister] addresses his decision, sets out what he intends to do around the easing on the 21st, he will address those points as well. ""He is very mindful of the need for businesses and others to get the support they need if they continue to be locked down or unable to open."" A Treasury spokesperson said it was ""committed to helping businesses and individuals through the pandemic and deliberately went long with our support to provide certainty over the summer"". ""The furlough scheme and support for the self employed is in place until September and eligible businesses will continue to benefit from business rates relief, VAT reduction and the Recovery Loan Scheme,"" they added.

suggests that - when it comes to the Delta variant first identified in
India - two doses of Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is
96% effective against hospitalisation, while two doses of Oxford-AstraZeneca is
92% effective. The hospitalisation rate measures the
proportion of people testing positive for coronavirus who end up being admitted
to hospital. There is a delay in the figures - the
data for infections is backdated seven days from the start of each month to
allow for the infections to take their course. The rate has fallen from about 10%
in February to about 5% in May. If you look at the most recent week for
which we have figures, which is the week to 8 June, the hospitalisation rate

Chris MasonPolitical Correspondent Earlier this afternoon, I joined a government briefing call to help understand the detail about what we have just heard in the news conference.

""How high would they have to go before you called the PM and say 'look maybe it is time to slow things down again?'"" he asks. Sir Patrick says: ""Realistically if we ever got a very very large wave there would be a very large number of people in hospital but the plan and the vaccination programme is designed precisely to stop that from occurring."" Murphy points out only 36% of Londoners have had second doses of coronavirus vaccine. He asks Prof Whitty how worried he is about this and what he will do to improve the situation? Prof Whitty says: ""On London, let's start with the glass half full, Londoners as in the rest of the UK have shown great enthusiasm for the vaccine. Overall the rates are higher than many countries would really dream of having at this point in time."" But he says they are behind other areas by about 10%. He says: ""You are completely right we do need to concentrate... and find the areas with the lowest rates and really push to get them up whatever the reasons are."" He asks the PM if he envisages nightclubs reopening and dispensing with masks and social distancing on what will be hailed the new Freedom Day on 19 July. The PM replies there are many businesses that need to move beyond social distancing and people are yearning to get back to that so I'm determined to be able to do that by 19 July. But to achieve an irreversible roadmap you have to be cautious, he says. And that brings the press conference to a close. Jessica ParkerBBC political correspondent Some good news for couples who are about to get married, but
with significant caveats. From 21 June, the limit of 30 at
weddings will be lifted. Technically thereâll be no cap on numbers. However, in
practice there will be. Venues will have to obey social distancing rules, with
table service. Downing Street has also said that there should not be dance floors. The prime minister acknowledged it will mean that weddings wonât be quite as
many hoped, apologising for the disappointment. Jim Pickard from the FT asks about summer holidays and the confusion he thinks many people feel about the advice from the government. The PM says the most important thing is to follow the red, amber, green guidance and there is not much more he can add at this stage. He then turns to furlough and says the plan was always to make sure it could continue until September. He says he doesn't think the rules on that will need to be changed based on vaccine efficacy and what he can see now in the data. James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News Scientists have advised ministers that a four-week delay to
Step 4 would reduce the peak in hospital admissions by between a third and a
half. Teams at Warwick University, the London School of Hygiene
and Tropical Medicine and Imperial College London have crunched the numbers. All anticipate a âsignificant resurgenceâ in people needing
hospital treatment if Step 4 goes ahead on 21 June. However, the size of that surge is wracked with uncertainty
as there are still questions about the delta variant, vaccines and our
behaviour once the rules are relaxed. As a result, SPI-M, the group of disease modellers that
feeds advice into government, says the size of the third wave âranges from
considerably smaller than January 2021 to considerably higherâ. But it anticipates even a short delay would lead to a
âsignificant dropâ in the number of Covid patients in hospital as âmore people
are vaccinated and as the school summer holidays get closerâ. Jason Groves at the Daily Mail asks Prof Whitty if he is as confident as the PM that 19 July will be the end of all restrictions in England. He asks the PM if he can give a ""cast iron guarantee that this will be the last delay"" provided no new variants of concern turn up. He asks if Andrew Lloyd Webber and other in the theatre industry factor into the PM's calculations on the delay. The PM says everyone is ""heartbroken"" at the impact on theatres and says he is in talks with Lloyd Webber over his latest production of Cinderella ""to try and make it work"". ""On the basis of what we can currently see I'm confident 19 July will be a terminal date not a 'not before' date,"" Johnson says. Prof Whitty says: ""I completely agree with the prime minister's answer and I'm sure Prof Valance would as well."" Tom Harwood  from GB News asks about the plan for booster jabs in the autumn. Can the media see the plan and when will the jabs actually go in to arms? The PM says we are seeing a surge in infections now and we must be realistic that people will very sadly continue to lose their lives so a booster plan will be set out very soon. The health secretary will come forward with a plan, he says. Sir Patrick says the plan at the moment is to get 18-year-olds and over vaccinated with the Pfizer and Moderna jab soon. The vaccines really are spectacularly effective, he adds. Carl Dinnen at ITV News asks the PM: ""Some of the support in place for business starts to reduce during this four-week delay, why aren't you keeping support and protections in place it at the level they are now?"" He asks Prof Whitty if we did not have this delay what does the modelling say is the worst that could happen to the NHS? Johnson says ""we are not going backwards"" and all the support measures are intended to last through to September. In terms of business rates local authorities have an extra Â£1bn to cover those who need it. He says the 21 June was always a not before date and realistically it'll be more like an extra four weeks rather than two. Prof Whitty says: ""Whatever rate we are seeing now would be significantly increased because it would see more mixing of households indoors."" Sir Patrick says: ""The four-week delay should reduce the peak, whatever it would be, by something between 30 and 50%... and actually it's not very obvious that you get much more gain from going on any longer than that."" Englandâs lockdown rules
wonât change as hoped on 21 June, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has confirmed. It means remaining
restrictions - affecting things like clubbing, festivals and capacity in pubs
and restaurants - will stay in place until at least 19 July. It also means that the
limits on how many people you can have in your home wonât be lifted. Thatâs six
people or two households indoors. Up to 30 can meet outside. Read our explainerto see
what you can and canât do. The BBC's Laura Kuenssberg asks if the PM will rule out any further delay to lifting the restrictions after this one. The PM says at a certain stage we are going to have to learn to live with the virus and manage it as best we can. The current delay is to try to reduce this current stage he says and bring down the overall levels of deaths. By 19 July, he says we will have built up a very substantial ""wall of immunity"" in the population but he has to be honest with people, there could be a new variant that we cannot foresee at this stage. We will be in a much better position in July to go forward as a country, he says. Twice-postponed bride Tessa in Bedfordhire asks why testing and vaccination status cannot be used to open up weddings as they are for football matches. She says she feels like weddings are the bottom of the priority list despite them being significant life events without which some people cannot progress with their lives. The PM says he is very sorry to hear that her wedding plans have been postponed twice. Johnson says he hopes it is of practical consolation to her that from 21 June weddings will be able go ahead with more than 30 people providing social distancing is observed. Andrew in Worthing asks the first question from the public. Is there a plan to prioritise vaccinating university students he wants to know? The PM says 23 to 24-year-olds can start coming forward for jabs. He says the government is going as fast as it can and will look at what it can do to accelerate things.  Â© 2025 BBC.

The health secretary will come forward with a plan, he says. Sir Patrick says the plan at the moment is to get 18-year-olds and over vaccinated with the Pfizer and Moderna jab soon. The vaccines really are spectacularly effective, he adds. Carl Dinnen at ITV News asks the PM: ""Some of the support in place for business starts to reduce during this four-week delay, why aren't you keeping support and protections in place it at the level they are now?"" He asks Prof Whitty if we did not have this delay what does the modelling say is the worst that could happen to the NHS? Johnson says ""we are not going backwards"" and all the support measures are intended to last through to September. In terms of business rates local authorities have an extra Â£1bn to cover those who need it. He says the 21 June was always a not before date and realistically it'll be more like an extra four weeks rather than two. Prof Whitty says: ""Whatever rate we are seeing now would be significantly increased because it would see more mixing of households indoors."" Sir Patrick says: ""The four-week delay should reduce the peak, whatever it would be, by something between 30 and 50%... and actually it's not very obvious that you get much more gain from going on any longer than that."" Englandâs lockdown rules
wonât change as hoped on 21 June, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has confirmed. It means remaining
restrictions - affecting things like clubbing, festivals and capacity in pubs
and restaurants - will stay in place until at least 19 July. It also means that the
limits on how many people you can have in your home wonât be lifted. Thatâs six
people or two households indoors. Up to 30 can meet outside. Read our explainerto see
what you can and canât do. The BBC's Laura Kuenssberg asks if the PM will rule out any further delay to lifting the restrictions after this one. The PM says at a certain stage we are going to have to learn to live with the virus and manage it as best we can. The current delay is to try to reduce this current stage he says and bring down the overall levels of deaths. By 19 July, he says we will have built up a very substantial ""wall of immunity"" in the population but he has to be honest with people, there could be a new variant that we cannot foresee at this stage. We will be in a much better position in July to go forward as a country, he says. Twice-postponed bride Tessa in Bedfordhire asks why testing and vaccination status cannot be used to open up weddings as they are for football matches. She says she feels like weddings are the bottom of the priority list despite them being significant life events without which some people cannot progress with their lives. The PM says he is very sorry to hear that her wedding plans have been postponed twice. Johnson says he hopes it is of practical consolation to her that from 21 June weddings will be able go ahead with more than 30 people providing social distancing is observed. Andrew in Worthing asks the first question from the public. Is there a plan to prioritise vaccinating university students he wants to know? The PM says 23 to 24-year-olds can start coming forward for jabs. He says the government is going as fast as it can and will look at what it can do to accelerate things.  Â© 2025 BBC.

"Eight-year-old CJ with Moroccan fans during the 1998 World Cup in France When Scotland's men last played in a major football tournament, C'est La Vie by B*witched was at number one in the charts, there was no Scottish Parliament and Google didn't exist. It was the summer of 1998 and eight-year-old CJ Cook was among the fans in France for the World Cup. Now 31 and a civil servant, she remembers ""an amazing party"" with a samba band soundtrack - ""an overwhelming experience"" for a child. ""The carnival atmosphere of France was very different to lower league Scottish football on a Saturday afternoon in the rain,"" CJ toldBBC Scotland's The Nine. The national team were full of pride, passion and promise but failed to make it out of the initial group stages after a typical combination of blunders and bad luck - including an agonising own goal against Brazil in the competition's opening game in Paris. CJ says supporting Scotland has been ""tiring"" over the past two decades It was the start of a 23-year-long drought which CJ describes as ""tiring"", even though she was - and remains - a loyal member of the Tartan Army, as Scotland's travelling support is known. ""We have snatched defeat from the jaws of victory on many an occasion,"" says CJ, wearily. If 1998 was the beginning of one gap in Scotland's national story, it was the end of another: the last full year without a parliament in Edinburgh for nearly three centuries. ""Today there is a new voice in the land,"" proclaimed Scotland's first First Minister, Donald Dewar as the new parliament opened in temporary accommodation on The Mound 10 months after that World Cup in France. It was, said Dewar, ""the voice of a democratic parliament. A  voice to shape Scotland. A voice, above all, for the future."" Donald Dewar opening the first Scottish Parliament in 300 years in 1999 Writer and broadcaster Stuart Cosgrove suggests the advent of devolution may have had an effect on Scottish football, taking some of the heat out of the game. While football was once ""the big volcano of patriotic fervour,"" Cosgrove argues that there are now many more options to display ""Scottishness"" - through the parliament itself; in what he calls the civic nationalist movement; and, increasingly, by following other national team sports. ""I wonder if it is the case now that Scotland has so many different places that it can celebrate its cultural and national identity that actually maybe it doesn't need football as much as it once did?"" Cosgrove says. This video can not be played Ahead of Euro 2020, Scotland fans share their memories of the World Cup in 1998 Certainly the environment in which the game is played has changed dramatically. Scottish football was forged in fire and dust, the fixation of a nation powered by heavy industry. Glasgow's Hampden Park has been the scene of many great football battles To the cities and towns of toil the sport offered not just tribal pride but glimpses of grace and glory. When 149,415 souls sardined into Glasgow's Hampden Park to see Scotland beat England 3-1 in 1937, the roar of the crowd had its echoes in the thunder of the furnace, the clanking of the shipyard and the rattle of the pit. Football then was a game for men - men of coal and steel and iron. But those days are long gone, that Scotland is no more, and football has changed too. ""With the decline of industry comes a kind of haemorrhaging,"" says Cosgrove. ""Social housing had been the heartbeat of football,"" he says, and its decline largely killed off ""the kickabout"" in back courts and cobbled streets. Football is no longer such a common sight on Glasgow's streets As Scotland become wealthier, healthier and more aspirational, car and home ownership rose and the space for street football - literally and imaginatively - was squeezed. Plus we now had other things to do: competition for young minds and young feet. Kevin's 11-year-old daughter plays up front for the under-13s team which he coaches in Perth. ""Emmy loves her football,"" he says. ""But I still have to drag her off her Xbox to come along to training."" Emmy chases the ball during a game in Perth We meet Kevin and Emmy on a busy playing field in Perth on a sunny Saturday morning. This is the home of Jeanfield Swifts, and half a dozen games and training sessions are already under way. ""I've always played football in school but nobody would ever pass to me because I was the only girl playing,"" says Emmy. ""I had to gain their respect and now they pass to me."" Was that annoying? ""Yeah,"" says Emmy, ""I had to tackle my own team mates."" Her dad says the arrival of more families at league football games has created a space for girls' and women's football to flourish and has forced men to improve their behaviour. Kevin says men have had to improve their behaviour ""Some of the songs they sang back in the days, you wouldn't do it when your mum's there or your daughter's there or your wife's there,"" he admits. ""There's not a chance."" Kevin says there is still a class divide at games between what he jokingly refers to as the ""prawn sandwich brigade"" and the ""ruffians"" - but overall those distinctions are melting away, he reckons. ""Football was designed for the working class,"" he says. ""Saturday morning you do your shift, you finish, you get a quick drink with your friends and then you're off to your local team,"" Kevin says. ""That's not a thing anymore. Football's had to change its outlook and try to encourage families."" Thousands of Rangers fans marched to George Square after the team won the Scottish league Of course there are still plenty of working men for whom a couple of pints and a game of football is woven into the weekend as an enjoyable ritual, and some of the darker aspects of the game haven't vanished either. In some quarters the shameful shadow of violence and sectarianism remains, as demonstrated by last month's violent, anti-Irish, anti-Catholic disorder by a minority of Rangers fans celebrating their team's league title in Glasgow's George Square. But for Mary Docherty, who grew up in Hamilton, South Lanarkshire, but now lives in Kinross, the game and the country have changed ""unrecognisably"". Scotland, she argues, is now more confident, with a stronger sense of national identity, than it was at the time of France '98. Mary Docherty with her daughter Olivia She also sees an opportunity shift for her sports-mad daughters, including Olivia, 16, who plays for Jeanfield Swifts under-17s and hopes to win a sports scholarship to study soccer in the United States. Mary says she's ""really excited"" about where sport could take her daughters, and girls in general. ""There are opportunities now that just didn't exist before,"" she says. As for Emmy, who 90 minutes later will be scoring a brace in her team's 8-2 victory - what does she get out of football? Without hesitation, the 11-year-old replies with a big smile and a single word: ""Joy.""

"Ned Beatty as he appeared in 2001 miniseries I Was a Rat US actor Ned Beatty, known for his roles in Deliverance, Superman and many other films, has died at the age of 83. According to his manager, he died on Sunday from natural causes ""surrounded by his family and loved ones"". Born in Kentucky in 1937, Beatty was Oscar-nominated in 1977 for playing a corporate CEO in Network, a role he filmed in a single day. He also appeared in All the President's Men and was heard as menacing teddy bear Lotso on Toy Story 3. Lee Unkrich, director of that 2010 animated film, said it had been ""a joy and an incredible honour"" to work with him. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Beatty made his screen debut in 1972's Deliverance, in which his character is brutally assaulted during a canoeing expedition. He went on to appear in a number of films with that movie's star, Burt Reynolds, and was also seen in Robert Altman's Nashville. In 1978's Superman he was seen as Lex Luthor's bumbling assistant Otis, a character that returned in 1980's Superman II. His other roles included playing Irish singer Josef Locke in Hear My Song, for which he was nominated for a Golden Globe in 1992.

"In one of the campaign ads, a couple is seen exchanging WhatsApp messages while at dinner with talkative friends WhatsApp has launched its first major privacy-focused advertising campaign in the UK. It follows a customer backlash against changes to its terms and conditions, announced earlier this year. The platform also said it is standing firm against pressure from governments, including the UK, to compromise on the way that it encrypts messages. Authorities should ""demand more security"" rather than less, WhatsApp boss Will Cathcart told the BBC. ""The first step of keeping people safe is, you have to have strong security, and we think governments shouldn't be out there trying to encourage tech companies to offer weak security,"" he said. ""They should be out there trying to encourage or even mandate that companies offer the strongest security possible."" The marketing campaign is set to run internationally, beginning in the UK and Germany on Monday. WhatsApp uses end-to-end encryption, which means messages can only be read on the device which sends one and the device which receives it. WhatsApp itself - and by default its parent company Facebook - cannot view or intercept them, and neither can law enforcement. Home Secretary Priti Patelhas described the use of end-to-end encryption as ""not acceptable""in the fight against the sharing of illegal content. In a speech in April said she wanted to see it used ""in a way in which is also consistent with public protection and child safety"" but did not elaborate on how this might work. Home Secretary Priti Patel has expressed concerns about end-to-end encryption enabling child abuse Facebook says it intends to roll out encryption more broadly across its other services. WhatsApp is already blocked in mainland China, andit is suing the Indian government over new digital rules that will force it to violate its privacy protections. Around 400 million of its two billion global users are in India. Mr Cathcart said he ""lives with the reality"" that more countries could also choose to block the platform as tech sector regulations tighten around the world. While the firm cannot see the content of messages, it has developed other tools which help it block illegal material and widely-shared misinformation. WhatsApp bans two million accounts every month, and in 2020 the platform reported 300,000 images to the National Centre for Missing Exploited Children, Mr Cathcart said. It does this using a combination of reports from message recipients, and machine-learning using the unencrypted data that WhatsApp can see - such as the volume of messages an account sends and how many groups it joins. Messages that have been forwarded lots of times before are also now flagged, and there are limits on how many people one user can share the same message with. In January, thousands of users threatened to leave WhatsApp, wrongly thinking it was going to start sharing messaging data with Facebook following an announcement about changes to its terms and conditions. Those who did not accept the update would begin to lose functionality, it said. There were false claims that the privacy of personal messages was about to change, andthousands of  alarmed people flocked to rival services such as Signal and Telegram. In fact the changes are mainly related to enabling companies to accept payments via WhatsApp. Will Cathcart said the firm took responsibility for the ""confusion"" the announcement had created. ""To reiterate, nothing about the privacy of people's personal conversations changed in our update,"" he said.

The North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, known as Nato, is the world's most powerful regional defence alliance It was set up in 1949, after World War Two, to counter the threat of communist expansion It was founded on the principle of collective defence between allies It originally had 12 members, but now has 30 Read more about Nato This video can not be played Nato explained in 80 seconds UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: ""When it comes to China, I don't think anybody around the table wants to descend into a new Cold War with China."" Nato's tough message on China followed criticism of the country by the G7, a group of major economies that met for a summit in England last week. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson arriving at the summit In a communiquÃ©G7 leaders criticised China for alleged human rights abusesand demanded a transparent investigation of the origins of Covid-19 in the country. In response, China accused the G7 of ""lies, rumours and baseless accusations"" in a statement through its embassy in the UK. The US leader famously said in an interview in March that he considered the Russian president to be a ""killer"", but on Monday he appeared to take a more conciliatory tone with regard to Mr Putin.

A mural in support of jailed Russian dissident Alexei Navalny can be seen on a wall in Geneva But Mr Biden stressed that he would take a tough line on what the US regards as Russia's ""harmful activities"" such as alleged cyber-attacks.

"This video can not be played Arlene Foster makes her final speech to the Northern Ireland Assembly as first minister Arlene Foster has urged Northern Ireland's political parties to stick to a language and cultural deal they agreed to in January 2020. Speaking in the Stormont assembly ahead of her resignation as first minister on Monday, Mrs Foster said the deal was ""the only model for success"". Sinn FÃ©in leader Mary Lou McDonald said the UK government had to move a law on Irish language through Westminster. The issue has long been a sticking point for Stormont's political parties. Mrs Foster's departure as first minister came six weeksafter she was ousted as Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader. In her statement to the assembly, she also said she would continue to speak up for women in public life. When Mrs Foster resigned, Sinn FÃ©in's Michelle O'Neill also lost her position as deputy first minister because the roles are a joint office. Arlene Foster spoke to Michelle O'Neill shortly before she delivered her resignation speech at Stormont There is now a seven-day period for the approval of a new first minister and deputy first minister by the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in. Sinn FÃ©in has suggested it may not support a new DUP first minister unless legislation on the Irish language is approved by ministers before 10 July. Arlene Foster: From trailblazing leader to party civil war Politicians pay tribute to Arlene Foster's service Mrs Foster said parties should support the deal on culture - which included language legislation - inthe New Decade, New Approach deal, which restored devolution to Northern Ireland in January 2020. She said: ""My team and I sought and secured a cultural package that would see a range of measures to advance identities and protect them for future generations. ""This is the only model for success - not one step forward for some and one step back for others."" The deal included an Office of Identity and Cultural Expression, an Irish language commissioner and a commissioner to enhance and develop the language and culture of the Ulster-Scots/Ulster-British tradition. Mary Lou McDonald says the UK and Irish governments should intervene in the row over Irish language legislation On Monday morning Edwin Poots, who replaced Mrs Foster as DUP leader last month, said he intended to support Irish language legislationbut not necessarily before the next assembly electionin May 2022. Speaking after a Sinn FÃ©in meeting with the UK government on Monday evening, Ms McDonald said her party would have preferred the legislation to be delivered through the Stormont as agreed. She said Sinn FÃ©in had ""engaged intensively"" with Mr Poots and his party. ""He has told us that they will not be delivering [the legislation] during the existing assembly mandate,"" she said. ""It is now incumbent on the British and Irish governments to act."" Speaking in the assembly, Mrs Foster said she would now spend more time with her family ""whether they like it or not"". ""It's just as well, Mr Speaker, I am such a good daughter, wife and mother,"" she added,in an apparent reference to Mr Poots' statement in 2016 when Mrs Foster became first ministerthat her ""most important job"" remained ""that of a wife, mother and daughter"". Mrs Foster said she had unfinished business to ensure Northern Ireland succeeded in its new century. This video can not be played Arlene Foster: ""It is only by respecting each other's identity that we will move forward."" ""I will contribute in whatever way I can to see Northern Ireland advance politically, socially, economically and culturally as part of the UK,"" she said. ""Strong, functioning devolution is vital to this."" She also called for changes tothe Northern Ireland Protocol- the part of the Brexit deal which keeps Northern Ireland within the EU single market for goods - which she said had thrown relations between the UK and Ireland and the UK and EU ""out of balance"". She said: ""If Brussels continues to think the protocol is enough, they are in denial. ""Imbalance and instability in the context of Northern Ireland is a truly dangerous cocktail. ""Northern Ireland is part of the United Kingdom and needs to be treated as such."" She didn't sing this time but she used a joke comparing her final speech to Father Ted Crilly's at the Golden Clerics. It wasn't that - for a start there were very few barbs, although Edwin Poots was probably the target when she talked about being a better wife and mother. On the issue which now threatens the existence of devolution - language - she praised the cultural package in the New Decade, New Approach Agreement, saying a step forward for one was a step backwards for others. And she took a final swipe at the Northern Ireland Protocol saying ""Northern Ireland is part of the UK and needs to be treated as such"", accusing Brussels of being in denial. But that is now a problem for others. Mrs Foster, however, says she has ""unfinished business"", whatever that will be. Mrs Foster served as first minister from January 2016 to January 2017 - when the Northern Ireland Assembly collapsed - and again from January 2020. She stood down as DUP leader after an internal party revolt, with at least 22 assembly members (MLAs) and four MPs signing a letter of no confidence. Her departure prompted a series of resignations within the DUP,with several councillors and party members expressing their anger about how she was ousted. Paul Givan (left) - pictured with DUP leader Edwin Poots - is the party's nomination for first minister Speaking last week, Mrs Foster said she wassad about the manner of her departure, but was ""looking forward"" to new possibilities. A sitting of the assembly to nominate a new first minister and deputy first minister could take place next Monday. Mr Poots has said he will nominate his party colleague Paul Givan to become the new first minister. How does the election of a new first minister work? How will Paul Givan handle the top job? Sinn FÃ©in must nominate a candidate for deputy first minister or a first minister is unable to take office. If the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in fail to nominate first and deputy first ministers, the Northern Ireland secretaryis obliged to call an electionwithin a reasonable time. SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said he feared that if the Stormont institutions collapsed they would not come back. He said ""grown up"" politicians ""make a commitment and get it done"". ""They don't threaten the whole edifice of government just because they don't get their own way,"" he said. Colum Eastwood wants the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in to sort out their differences on language legislation Ulster Unionist leader Doug Beattie said the deadlock over language laws was a ""serious situation where our institutions could fall and our people could suffer"". He called on Sinn FÃ©in and the DUP to  ""put the people first and come up with an agreement"". The DUP's other new ministers affirmed the pledge of office and took up their posts on Monday afternoon.

"It is cheaper to rent a property than it is to buy a home for the first time in more than six years, says Hamptons. Research by the estate agency suggests that before the pandemic began in March 2020, people buying with a 10% deposit would have been better off than renters by Â£102 a month. But last month, it found the average private sector tenant was better off, spending Â£71 a month less in rent. There are now only four areas in the UK where it is cheaper to buy than rent. They are the North East, North West, Yorkshire and Humber, and Scotland. This is in contrast to May last year, when rental demand dropped as younger adults returned to live with their families during the pandemic and work and leisure restrictions made city living less attractive. In early 2020, it was cheaper to buy instead of renting in every nation or region in the UK. Hamptons says the switch comes despite a 7.1% rise in average rents over the past 12 months, as strong house price growth coupled with increases in higher loan-to-value (LTV) mortgage rates have added to the cost of buying and owning a home. As a result, a typical first-time buyer will now find it cheaper to rent than buy on a monthly basis, with a monthly average of Â£1,054 spent on rent compared with Â£1,125 on mortgage repayments - the first time since December 2014 that renting has been cheaper than buying. London has seen the largest shift since the start of the coronavirus pandemic. Falling rents there mean a buyer putting down a 10% deposit on a property in the capital will have gone from being Â£123 a month better off buying in March 2020, to spending Â£251 a month less on rent in May 2021, the report said. There are, of course, a host of other financial and practical factors which potential first-time buyers will consider when deciding to rent rather than buy, or vice versa, which are not captured in this research. Greater London - Â£251 cheaper South East - Â£54 cheaper South West - Â£108 cheaper East - Â£117 cheaper East Midlands - Â£98 cheaper West Midlands, Â£35 cheaper Yorkshire and the Humber - Â£5 more expensive North West - Â£4 more expensive North East - Â£72 more expensive Wales - Â£11 cheaper Scotland - Â£130 more expensive Aneisha Beveridge, Hamptons' head of research, said the pandemic was responsible for reversing this six-year-long trend. ""A year ago, lenders were either increasing their rates or withdrawing higher loan-to-value mortgages altogether,"" she said. ""For first-time buyers in particular this pushed up the cost of paying a mortgage, if they could get one at all, to well above the cost of renting."" Ms Beveridge added that it was likely that the balance would swing back somewhat towards buying, particularly as mortgage rates come down, but this would likely be partly offset by rising house prices. ""And while interest rates are falling, they're still considerably above where they were pre-pandemic on higher LTV (loan-to-value) loans,"" she said. ""Despite this, we expect the gap between renting and buying to close over the remainder of this year, moving back towards longer-term levels in 2022.""

"In one of the campaign ads, a couple is seen exchanging WhatsApp messages while at dinner with talkative friends WhatsApp has launched its first major privacy-focused advertising campaign in the UK. It follows a customer backlash against changes to its terms and conditions, announced earlier this year. The platform also said it is standing firm against pressure from governments, including the UK, to compromise on the way that it encrypts messages. Authorities should ""demand more security"" rather than less, WhatsApp boss Will Cathcart told the BBC. ""The first step of keeping people safe is, you have to have strong security, and we think governments shouldn't be out there trying to encourage tech companies to offer weak security,"" he said. ""They should be out there trying to encourage or even mandate that companies offer the strongest security possible."" The marketing campaign is set to run internationally, beginning in the UK and Germany on Monday. WhatsApp uses end-to-end encryption, which means messages can only be read on the device which sends one and the device which receives it. WhatsApp itself - and by default its parent company Facebook - cannot view or intercept them, and neither can law enforcement. Home Secretary Priti Patelhas described the use of end-to-end encryption as ""not acceptable""in the fight against the sharing of illegal content. In a speech in April said she wanted to see it used ""in a way in which is also consistent with public protection and child safety"" but did not elaborate on how this might work. Home Secretary Priti Patel has expressed concerns about end-to-end encryption enabling child abuse Facebook says it intends to roll out encryption more broadly across its other services. WhatsApp is already blocked in mainland China, andit is suing the Indian government over new digital rules that will force it to violate its privacy protections. Around 400 million of its two billion global users are in India. Mr Cathcart said he ""lives with the reality"" that more countries could also choose to block the platform as tech sector regulations tighten around the world. While the firm cannot see the content of messages, it has developed other tools which help it block illegal material and widely-shared misinformation. WhatsApp bans two million accounts every month, and in 2020 the platform reported 300,000 images to the National Centre for Missing Exploited Children, Mr Cathcart said. It does this using a combination of reports from message recipients, and machine-learning using the unencrypted data that WhatsApp can see - such as the volume of messages an account sends and how many groups it joins. Messages that have been forwarded lots of times before are also now flagged, and there are limits on how many people one user can share the same message with. In January, thousands of users threatened to leave WhatsApp, wrongly thinking it was going to start sharing messaging data with Facebook following an announcement about changes to its terms and conditions. Those who did not accept the update would begin to lose functionality, it said. There were false claims that the privacy of personal messages was about to change, andthousands of  alarmed people flocked to rival services such as Signal and Telegram. In fact the changes are mainly related to enabling companies to accept payments via WhatsApp. Will Cathcart said the firm took responsibility for the ""confusion"" the announcement had created. ""To reiterate, nothing about the privacy of people's personal conversations changed in our update,"" he said.

"This video can not be played Disappointment for fans as Scotland lose opening Euro match Scotland fans have seen their team's first appearance in a major tournament in 23 years end in a disappointing 2-0 defeat. About 12,000 people were in Hampden Park in Glasgow to watch the Euro 2020 match against the Czech Republic. A further 3,000 people watched from a fan zone in the city, while many tuned in to the TV from home or in pubs. But goals in either half from the Czech Republic's Patrik Schick left the Tartan Army crushed. Steve Clarke's men now sit bottom of Group D and will play England in London on Friday. First Minister Nicola Sturgeontweeted a tearful emoji,externalbut added: ""Onwards and upwards though...next stop Wembley."" They are due to play England on Friday, before returning to Hampden for the final group game against Croatia on 22 June. Schick wonder goal helps Czech Republic beat Scotland In pictures: Fans watch Scotland's Euros return How Scotland has changed since France '98 Richard Templeton, 33, a lawyer from Edinburgh, said he felt ""dejected"" by the defeat. He said: ""They tried their best. They are going to beat England so I'm not so worried about this match."" He said he took the day off work to watch the game in a pub in the capital but was still optimistic Scotland would qualify. Richard Templeton (left) and Ally Atha watched the match in Edinburgh Ally Atha, 34, a marketing manager from Edinburgh, also watched the match in a pub. He said: ""I feel crestfallen. I thought they were going to win. ""I have no hope now for the tournamentâ¦ all my optimism is deflated, but it's good to be here."" Fellow Tartan Army fan John Allardice felt Scotland manager Steve Clarke should take much of the blame for the result. He said: ""Poor team selection and a negative mentality gets you exactly what you deserve. Really hoping the manager will make bolder choices for the England game, even if we get a pasting. Scotland fans react to the opening goal in the Glasgow fan zone Malcolm MacKenzie said the result reminded him of the disappointment of watching Scotland at the World Cup in Argentina 43 years ago. He said: ""It will be the same as Ally McLeod not playing an in-form Souness in Argentina in 1978 - lose the first two games and be out before he plays Billy Gilmour in the Croatia game, and he plays out of his skin and Scotland win at a canter."" Scotland supporters in the Glasgow Green fan zone said the atmosphere was ""unbelievable"" and a far better option than watching the game in a pub. Concerns had beenraised about the safety of the eventamid the pandemic and rising case numbers in Glasgow. But Eddie Smith, 25, from Dunfermline, said: ""It needed to go ahead here and it's unbelievable it has. The security is great, everyone is sitting down, spaced apart. ""If you didn't have this, everyone would be firing into a pub or a flat, with a lot more than six people."" Supporters outside the fan zone before the match Supporters delivered a rousing rendition of Flower of Scotland on Glasgow Green James Hill, 26, was joined by his friends Steven Thistleton, 25, and Ross McArthur, 19, at the outdoor event. He said: ""It's basically a massive beer garden, although I was a bit shocked that it's Â£13 for a pizza. Pints are Â£6 which is all right. ""We've not come into close contact with anyone outside our group, everything's getting brought to us. ""If you weren't here you would be in a pub or a flat, and they've got track and trace and security so it's brilliant."" Where did you watch the match? At school, work or home?

"Boris Johnson confirms a four-week delay to the lifting of all restrictions in England beyond 21 June The new date for lifting the restrictions has now been set at 19 July The PM says he is 'confident' the delay will not need to be longer than four weeks Capacity limits for sports, pubs and cinemas will remain, and nightclubs will remain closed The number of guests at weddings and wakes will no longer be limited to 30, but restrictions on these events will remain The delay is designed to allow more people to be vaccinated and have second doses amid rising cases of the Delta variant Cases are growing by about 64% per week and in the worst affected areas are doubling each week By 19 July 'we will aim to have double jabbed two-thirds of the adult population', says the PM Businesses are fearful of further heavy losses and the clubbing trade body is threatening legal action Headache, sore throat, runny nose are now the most commonly reported symptoms linked to Covid infection in the UK, researchers say India has reported 70,421 new infections - its lowest number since 31 March and down from a peak of about 400,000 daily cases in May We're going to bring our live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic to an end now. We'll be back on Tuesday morning. The page was written by Alexandra FouchÃ©, Emma Harrison, Alex Kleiderman, Jen Meierhans, Lauren Turner, Sinead Wilson and George Wright, and edited by Claire Heald. And the key developments in the UK:  We're bringing our live coverage to a close shortly but before we go here is what has been happening around the world: Theatres and cinemas have reacted with disappointment to the confirmation that they will not be able to welcome full capacity audiences back to venues in England on 21 June. Julian Bird, who heads the Society of London
Theatre-UK Theatre industry group, urged the government to provide more financial support to the sector, saying its decision will
have ""serious implications"". ""This delay not only impacts productions and theatres
preparing to open in the next few weeks, but also shows currently running
socially distanced, which had planned to increase their capacity - and
producers making the difficult decision whether to start rehearsals for shows
due to open in late July or August,"" he said. His call was echoed by the UK Cinema Association, which said in a statement: ""While mindful of the rationale behind todayâs decision... many of its members will continue to face significant challenges as they look to recover from the enormous financial impacts of Covid"". Planning on going to a
fesival or this summer? Or to see your favourite band? Covid rules for gigs will
now remain in place - and nightclubs will stay shut - until 19 July. You can go to an event at
the moment - but only if organisers limit attendance and ensure social
distancing. One-thousand people inside
(4,000 outside) or 50% of a venueâs capacity - whichever is lower - can
currently attend a gig in England. Rules vary across the UK -
take a lookat our comprehensive guide.  The rules on weddings and
civil partnerships in England are being relaxed from 21 June. The current limit of 30
people at a ceremony or reception will be lifted. However, social distancing
and face coverings will be needed. Before you buy your new
hat -read our updated explainer. Reality Check Boris Johnson says that the link
between Covid infection and hospitalisation has been âweakenedâ but not
âseveredâ. The hospitalisation rate is a key
measure of how effective the vaccination programme is. Analysis from Public Health England
suggests that - when it comes to the Delta variant first identified in
India - two doses of Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is
96% effective against hospitalisation, while two doses of Oxford-AstraZeneca is
92% effective. The hospitalisation rate measures the
proportion of people testing positive for coronavirus who end up being admitted
to hospital. There is a delay in the figures - the
data for infections is backdated seven days from the start of each month to
allow for the infections to take their course. The rate has fallen from about 10%
in February to about 5% in May. If you look at the most recent week for
which we have figures, which is the week to 8 June, the hospitalisation rate
has dropped below 4%. However, Englandâs Chief Medical
Officer, Prof Chris Whitty, has cautioned that: âThe hospitalisations are
following, but with a delay, the number of cases."" Shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth tells Radio 5 Live the delay will ""come as a massive blow"" to business but ""we are in this state because Boris Johnson failed to protect our borders"". The borders were  ""as weak as a sieve"" he says and that let the delta variant in to the country. Labour will support the restrictions ""with a heavy heart"" he says but we must be clear that the virus is surging because the PM ""left the back door open and allowed the variant to wash up on our shores"". Chris MasonPolitical Correspondent Earlier this afternoon, I joined a government briefing call to help understand the detail about what we have just heard in the news conference. Here are a handful of things that caught my eye - and the reaction they are provoking: Joe Murphy of the Evening Standard asks Sir Patrick if he would be relaxed if infections went back to January levels? ""How high would they have to go before you called the PM and say 'look maybe it is time to slow things down again?'"" he asks. Sir Patrick says: ""Realistically if we ever got a very very large wave there would be a very large number of people in hospital but the plan and the vaccination programme is designed precisely to stop that from occurring."" Murphy points out only 36% of Londoners have had second doses of coronavirus vaccine. He asks Prof Whitty how worried he is about this and what he will do to improve the situation? Prof Whitty says: ""On London, let's start with the glass half full, Londoners as in the rest of the UK have shown great enthusiasm for the vaccine. Overall the rates are higher than many countries would really dream of having at this point in time."" But he says they are behind other areas by about 10%. He says: ""You are completely right we do need to concentrate... and find the areas with the lowest rates and really push to get them up whatever the reasons are."" He asks the PM if he envisages nightclubs reopening and dispensing with masks and social distancing on what will be hailed the new Freedom Day on 19 July. The PM replies there are many businesses that need to move beyond social distancing and people are yearning to get back to that so I'm determined to be able to do that by 19 July. But to achieve an irreversible roadmap you have to be cautious, he says. And that brings the press conference to a close. Jessica ParkerBBC political correspondent Some good news for couples who are about to get married, but
with significant caveats. From 21 June, the limit of 30 at
weddings will be lifted. Technically thereâll be no cap on numbers. However, in
practice there will be. Venues will have to obey social distancing rules, with
table service. Downing Street has also said that there should not be dance floors. The prime minister acknowledged it will mean that weddings wonât be quite as
many hoped, apologising for the disappointment. Jim Pickard from the FT asks about summer holidays and the confusion he thinks many people feel about the advice from the government. The PM says the most important thing is to follow the red, amber, green guidance and there is not much more he can add at this stage. He then turns to furlough and says the plan was always to make sure it could continue until September. He says he doesn't think the rules on that will need to be changed based on vaccine efficacy and what he can see now in the data. James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News Scientists have advised ministers that a four-week delay to
Step 4 would reduce the peak in hospital admissions by between a third and a
half. Teams at Warwick University, the London School of Hygiene
and Tropical Medicine and Imperial College London have crunched the numbers. All anticipate a âsignificant resurgenceâ in people needing
hospital treatment if Step 4 goes ahead on 21 June. However, the size of that surge is wracked with uncertainty
as there are still questions about the delta variant, vaccines and our
behaviour once the rules are relaxed. As a result, SPI-M, the group of disease modellers that
feeds advice into government, says the size of the third wave âranges from
considerably smaller than January 2021 to considerably higherâ. But it anticipates even a short delay would lead to a
âsignificant dropâ in the number of Covid patients in hospital as âmore people
are vaccinated and as the school summer holidays get closerâ. Jason Groves at the Daily Mail asks Prof Whitty if he is as confident as the PM that 19 July will be the end of all restrictions in England. He asks the PM if he can give a ""cast iron guarantee that this will be the last delay"" provided no new variants of concern turn up. He asks if Andrew Lloyd Webber and other in the theatre industry factor into the PM's calculations on the delay. The PM says everyone is ""heartbroken"" at the impact on theatres and says he is in talks with Lloyd Webber over his latest production of Cinderella ""to try and make it work"". ""On the basis of what we can currently see I'm confident 19 July will be a terminal date not a 'not before' date,"" Johnson says. Prof Whitty says: ""I completely agree with the prime minister's answer and I'm sure Prof Valance would as well."" Tom Harwood  from GB News asks about the plan for booster jabs in the autumn. Can the media see the plan and when will the jabs actually go in to arms? The PM says we are seeing a surge in infections now and we must be realistic that people will very sadly continue to lose their lives so a booster plan will be set out very soon. The health secretary will come forward with a plan, he says. Sir Patrick says the plan at the moment is to get 18-year-olds and over vaccinated with the Pfizer and Moderna jab soon. The vaccines really are spectacularly effective, he adds. Carl Dinnen at ITV News asks the PM: ""Some of the support in place for business starts to reduce during this four-week delay, why aren't you keeping support and protections in place it at the level they are now?"" He asks Prof Whitty if we did not have this delay what does the modelling say is the worst that could happen to the NHS? Johnson says ""we are not going backwards"" and all the support measures are intended to last through to September. In terms of business rates local authorities have an extra Â£1bn to cover those who need it. He says the 21 June was always a not before date and realistically it'll be more like an extra four weeks rather than two. Prof Whitty says: ""Whatever rate we are seeing now would be significantly increased because it would see more mixing of households indoors."" Sir Patrick says: ""The four-week delay should reduce the peak, whatever it would be, by something between 30 and 50%... and actually it's not very obvious that you get much more gain from going on any longer than that."" Englandâs lockdown rules
wonât change as hoped on 21 June, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has confirmed. It means remaining
restrictions - affecting things like clubbing, festivals and capacity in pubs
and restaurants - will stay in place until at least 19 July. It also means that the
limits on how many people you can have in your home wonât be lifted. Thatâs six
people or two households indoors. Up to 30 can meet outside. Read our explainerto see
what you can and canât do. The BBC's Laura Kuenssberg asks if the PM will rule out any further delay to lifting the restrictions after this one. The PM says at a certain stage we are going to have to learn to live with the virus and manage it as best we can. The current delay is to try to reduce this current stage he says and bring down the overall levels of deaths. By 19 July, he says we will have built up a very substantial ""wall of immunity"" in the population but he has to be honest with people, there could be a new variant that we cannot foresee at this stage. We will be in a much better position in July to go forward as a country, he says. Twice-postponed bride Tessa in Bedfordhire asks why testing and vaccination status cannot be used to open up weddings as they are for football matches. She says she feels like weddings are the bottom of the priority list despite them being significant life events without which some people cannot progress with their lives. The PM says he is very sorry to hear that her wedding plans have been postponed twice. Johnson says he hopes it is of practical consolation to her that from 21 June weddings will be able go ahead with more than 30 people providing social distancing is observed. Andrew in Worthing asks the first question from the public. Is there a plan to prioritise vaccinating university students he wants to know? The PM says 23 to 24-year-olds can start coming forward for jabs. He says the government is going as fast as it can and will look at what it can do to accelerate things.  Â© 2025 BBC.

"Among those detained on Sunday is former Sandinista Health Minister Dora TÃ©llez Police in Nicaragua have detained five more prominent opposition figures, in what critics say is a crackdown on opponents of the country's president. Several former allies of long-time President Daniel Ortega, 75, were among those arrested on Sunday. Police accused them of inciting foreign interference in Nicaragua's affairs, among other crimes. Twelve senior opposition figures, including four presidential hopefuls, have been arrested in recent days. Opposition to Mr Ortega, who is currently serving his fourth term in office, three of them consecutive, has been growing in the past years. In 2018, mass anti-government protests swept through the country but were met with a violent police response. Hundreds were killed and thousands were injured in the clashes between the protesters on the one hand, and the security forces and pro-government militia on the other. Why speaking out in Nicaragua is getting tough Nicaragua opposition figure put under house arrest Nicaragua country profile After many of those who had lead the demonstrations were arrested, the protests eventually fizzled out later that year. Mr Ortega rejected calls made at the time for elections to be brought forward and continued to serve his term. But critics say that with the scheduled date of the presidential poll approaching - they are due to be held in November 2021 - he is now targeting anyone who may stand against him. Julie Chung, the top US diplomat for Latin America, said the arrests were part of a ""campaign of terror"" by Mr Ortega. Daniel Ortega in the 1980s and in 2018 Played a key role in the armed struggle against dictator Anastasio Somoza, whose family had ruled the country since 1936 Formed part of the Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN), which seized power after ousting Somoza in 1979 Elected president in 1984, after having been part of the junta which had ruled since 1979 Defeated in the 1990 election after his presidency was marred by economic collapse and a war against US-backed right-wing rebel groups Accused of sexual abuse by own stepdaughter in 1998 Makes a come-back in 2006 after rebranding himself as a Christian socialist Wins elections in 2011 and 2016 following constitutional changes that allowed him to run again From revolutionary leader to opposition hate figure The police said those detained over the weekend were all members of Unamos, an opposition party that is largely made up of dissidents who split from President Ortega's governing party, the Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN). The FSLN was a socialist revolutionary movement that overthrew dictator Anastasio Somoza and swept to power in the Central American nation in 1979. Those detained in the past two days are: Suyen Barahona, president of Unamos Hugo Torres, vice-president of Unamos Dora TÃ©llez, former comrade-in-arms of President Ortega turned critic Ana Margarita Vijil, lawyer and Unamos activist Tamara DÃ¡vila, Unamos activist They join seven other opposition leaders in detention, including four potential presidential candidates, who have been arrested since the start of the month: FÃ©lix Maradiaga, presidential hopeful Juan SebastiÃ¡n Chamorro,presidential hopeful Cristiana Chamorro, presidential hopeful and daughter of ex-President Violeta Chamorro Arturo Cruz, former ambassador and presidential hopeful JosÃ© AdÃ¡n Aguerri, economist and head of the Committee on Economic Integration Violeta Granera, sociologist and opposition activist JosÃ© Pallais, lawyer and opposition activist While those detained in the first wave of arrests last week were long-standing political rivals of Mr Ortega, some of those detained this past weekend were once allies and even comrades-in-arms of the president. Gen Torres, who is 73, fought with Mr Ortega in the Nicaraguan revolution and secured his release from jail in 1974, something he alluded to in a video he had recorded before his arrest. ""Forty-six years ago I risked my life to free Daniel Ortega and other comrades who were political prisoners from prison,"" Gen Torres said in the defiant recording. ""These are desperate moves by a regime that feels it is moribund, that has no legal standing, that has no justification... to remain in power beyond November of this year when free and supervised elections should be held,"" he added. Dora TÃ©llez, 65, is another former revolutionary commander who turned against Mr Ortega. Ms TÃ©llez served as health minister during Mr Ortega first government in the 1980s but years later became a vocal critic of his leadership. Nearly all of those detained have been accused of plotting against Nicaragua's sovereignty and independence and of organising terrorist acts with financial help from foreign powers. They have been held under a controversial treason law passed in December by Nicaragua's National Assembly, which is dominated by government allies. Under the law, the government has the power to ban candidates from running for office if they are deemed to be traitors to Nicaragua. Anyone designated a traitor can be sent to prison for up to 15 years. The government says the law aims to protect ""the independence, the sovereignty and self-determination"" of Nicaragua. It says the country is under threat from imperialist powers in the US and ""coup-mongers"" within Nicaragua who are determined to overthrow President Ortega.

restrictions - affecting things like clubbing, festivals and capacity in pubs
and restaurants - will stay in place until at least 19 July. It also means that the
limits on how many people you can have in your home wonât be lifted. Thatâs six
people or two households indoors. Up to 30 can meet outside. Read our explainerto see
what you can and canât do. The BBC's Laura Kuenssberg asks if the PM will rule out any further delay to lifting the restrictions after this one. The PM says at a certain stage we are going to have to learn to live with the virus and manage it as best we can. The current delay is to try to reduce this current stage he says and bring down the overall levels of deaths. By 19 July, he says we will have built up a very substantial ""wall of immunity"" in the population but he has to be honest with people, there could be a new variant that we cannot foresee at this stage. We will be in a much better position in July to go forward as a country, he says. Twice-postponed bride Tessa in Bedfordhire asks why testing and vaccination status cannot be used to open up weddings as they are for football matches. She says she feels like weddings are the bottom of the priority list despite them being significant life events without which some people cannot progress with their lives. The PM says he is very sorry to hear that her wedding plans have been postponed twice. Johnson says he hopes it is of practical consolation to her that from 21 June weddings will be able go ahead with more than 30 people providing social distancing is observed. Andrew in Worthing asks the first question from the public. Is there a plan to prioritise vaccinating university students he wants to know? The PM says 23 to 24-year-olds can start coming forward for jabs. He says the government is going as fast as it can and will look at what it can do to accelerate things.  Â© 2025 BBC.

"Teachers say literacy skills have been hit by the pandemic Education should not be ""the punchbag"" that takes the financial hit as Wales recovers from the pandemic, a leading economist has said. Prof Gerald Holtham said the Welsh government should focus resources on ""supporting education"" and young families. He suggested a ""one-off levy"" could be introduced to raise capital for restoring the education system. The Welsh government said it was providing over Â£150m of extra funding. Prof Holtham, a former Welsh government adviser and a visiting professor at Cardiff Metropolitan University, said the ""political pressures to spend on health are always very heavy"" but spending on education was ""particularly important"" at the moment. ""Education is already a very big part of the budget, inevitably, but I think we can't let it get squeezed now, in order to keep increasing expenditure on health,"" he said. ""If we can increase expenditure on both, that's wonderful, but I don't think we can let education be the punchbag or the sponge that absorbs the pressure. We've got to give it priority... ""I think we ought to really be focusing on swinging our resources more into supporting education, supporting training, supporting early years, supporting young families,"" he said. ""If that means that we have to, over time, grow expenditure on social care and health a bit slower, I think we've got to bite the bullet - that's what we've got to do."" Prof Gerald Holtham suggested a ""one-off levy"" to raise capital for restoring the education system Spending on health and social services combined accounted for more than half of the Welsh government's budget in 2019-20, whereas education made up about 21% of the total expenditure. While Prof Holtham believes a longer term education strategy is required, he suggested a ""one-off levy"" next year was an option he would ""certainly consider"" to help teachers and pupils to catch up following the disruption to schooling. The Education Policy Institute has estimated Â£600m to Â£900m would be needed over three years to help children in Wales catch up on lost learning. In England, the education recovery commissioner resigned, saying the UK government's funding for its plan fell short of what was needed. Teacher Vicki Creedon says it will be a long time before some children catch up Vicki Creedon a reception class teacher at Ton-yr-Ywen Primary School in Cardiff, has seen the impact of the pandemic disruption on many of her pupils. ""We've noticed that the literacy skills have really been affected because in reception, learning is all through play, so you set things up, you've got the adults that facilitate the learning, but with the best will in the world that can't be done at home,"" she said. She added that while ""some children will catch up quicker than others"", it will be ""a long time"" before some get up to speed. ""It's about - as a teacher - gauging which children are moving on, which ones you need to pull. ""But to be able to do that you need the facilities, you need the adults, you need the resources to be able to do it."" Teacher Hannah Ambler says the pandemic will have affected different schools in different ways Teachers in secondary schools are facing similar issues. ""When they returned, we saw that pupils had lost a lot of confidence, particularly being around and in a school environment,"" said Hannah Ambler, head of year 11 at Ysgol Gymraeg Ystalyfera, in Neath Port Talbot. The school has tried to increase opportunities to engage in speaking and listening activities with pupils, as many had lost confidence in communicating, particularly through the medium of Welsh. ""We have found that our catch-up needs are bespoke to our school - the impact of the pandemic will have affected different schools in different ways,"" she added. ""But most certainly, we would use the money in order to close any gaps that we feel need to be filled for our pupils."" Year 12 pupils at Ysgol Gymraeg Ystalyfera say the last year has presented challenges Sophie, a year 12 pupil at Ysgol Gymraeg Ystalyfera, said it had been a ""complicated"" 18 months. ""It's been just a lot to deal with, inside school and outside, and having to have to adapt to new learning ways online,"" she said. She added that although some teaching during the summer might work, extending the school day would be detrimental. ""At the end of the day, you have to consider young people's mental health during this whole thing, which hasn't been the best,"" she said. Sophie's classmate Rhodri said he struggled with learning from home. ""I haven't been able to communicate with my teacher as well, because when I'm in class I'm able to ask questions and get the answers and even ask other pupils as well, but online I haven't been able to do that,"" he said. ""It made me feel quite lonely and made me less motivated to do work."" Harry, also in year 12, found it hard to adapt to online learning initially. He said catching up with any lost education would mean teachers having to give more time to pupils. ""I think it's just teachers investing time to us, treating us less like robots,"" he said. ""I think they need to take into account our feelings and how hard these last 18 months have been. ""Maybe a couple of hours a week to finish work we haven't finished would be a good idea. ""In sixth form we have a lot of free lessons to finish the work, I feel sorry for the years below because they have a full day and don't have free lessons."" The Welsh government said: ""Supporting our learners throughout and after the pandemic is a top priority."" It added it was providing over Â£150m of extra funding for learning, which included recruiting more than 1,800 teachers and school staff as part of the programme to ""recruit, recover and raise standards"" in education.

"This video can not be played G7 pledge of a billion doses for poorer countries is ""another big step towards vaccinating the world"", says UK PM Leaders of the major industrial nations have pledged one billion Covid vaccine doses to poor countries as a ""big step towards vaccinating the world"", Boris Johnson has said. At the end of the G7 summit in Cornwall, the PM said countries were rejecting ""nationalistic approaches"". He said vaccinating the world would show the benefits of the G7's democratic values. There was also a pledge to wipe out their contribution to climate change. After the first meeting of world leaders in two years, Mr Johnson said ""the world was looking to us to reject some of the selfish, nationalistic approaches that marred the initial global response to the pandemic and to channel all our diplomatic, economic and scientific might to defeating Covid for good"". He said the G7 leaders had pledged to supply the vaccines to poor countries - including 100 million from the UK - either directly or through the Covax scheme, which is being co-led by the World Health Organization, Gavi and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations. Thecommunique issued by the summit,externalpledges to ""end the pandemic and prepare for the future by driving an intensified international effort, starting immediately, to vaccinate the world by getting as many safe vaccines to as many people as possible as fast as possible"". It also includes steps to tackle climate change, with leaders re-committing to the target of reaching net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 at the latest andpledging to eliminate most coal power. What difference could G7 vaccine donations make? In Pictures: World leaders bask in Cornwall sun at G7 summit How significant are G7's climate pledges? Has this been a G7 summit that mattered? Mr Johnson rejected suggestions the vaccines pledge was a moral failure by the G7 as it was not enough to cover the needs of poorer countries. He referred to the the UK's involvement in the development of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. ""Already of the 1.5 billion vaccines that have been distributed around the world, I think that people in this country should be very proud that half a billion of them are as a result of the actions taken by the UK government in doing that deal with the Oxford scientists and AstraZeneca to distribute it at cost,"" he said. He added that ""we are going flat out and we are producing vaccines as fast as we can, and distributing them as fast as we can"". The target to vaccinate the world by the end of next year would be met ""very largely thanks to the efforts of the countries who have come here today"", Mr Johnson said. The leaders slightly exceeded their target of donating a billion Covid vaccines to poorer countries within the next year, if funding for future doses is included alongside individual jabs. There was also a commitment to build the frameworks to prevent and fight future pandemics. Elsewhere in the 25-page communique, there were several references to China, which President Biden said was a change from previous meetings of the world's advanced economies. Pledges made this time included working together to respond to China's impact on world trade. On the recovery from Covid there was even a reference to Prime Minister Boris Johnson's trademark domestic policy - the need to reduce inequalities by ""levelling up"". Charities and campaigners issued statements calling out vague promises and missed opportunities, but Mr Johnson will feel that post-Brexit Britain has staged a diplomatic show that was both competent and confident. Mr Johnson also dismissed the suggestion that patents for vaccines should be waived in order to boost global supply, something whichthe US backed last month. He said he wanted to protect ""incentives for innovation"" while building up manufacturing capacity, especially in Africa. Elsewhere in their communique, G7 leaders also pledged to: improve early warning systems to prepare for future health crises phase out coal-fired power stations without carbon capture technology and raise $100bn (Â£70bn) to help poorer countries cut emissions support a green revolution that creates jobs, cuts emissions and seeks to limit the rise in global temperatures to 1.5 degrees reinvigorate their economies ""with plans that create jobs, invest in infrastructure, drive innovation, support people, and level up so that no place or person, irrespective of age, ethnicity or gender is left behind"" ""build back better"" by establishing a clean, green growth fund for infrastructure developments in developing countries respond to China's impact on world trade and challenge practices which ""undermine the fair and transparent operation of the global economy"" call on China to respect human rights, especially in relation to Xinjiang, where it has been accused of abuses against Uyghur Muslims get 40 million more girls into education by 2026 The communique calls for a ""timely, transparent, expert-led, and science-based WHO-convened"" investigation into the origins of Covid-19. US President Joe Biden has previously saidthe US intelligence community is spliton whether coronavirus came from human contact with an infected animal or from a lab accident - a theory rejected by China. G7 calls for access to famine-hit Ethiopian region Mr Johnson said ""the advice that we've had is it doesn't look as though this particular disease of zoonotic origin came from a lab"", but he added: ""Clearly anybody sensible would want to keep an open mind about that"". French President Emmanuel Macron said the international community needed clarity about the origins of the virus but said it was up to the WHO to investigate. With G7 countries accounting for 20% of carbon emissions, Mr Johnson said: ""We were clear this weekend that action needs to start with us."" But pressed on the lack of binding agreements and timetables, the prime minister says he will not ""pretend our work is done"" and he will be ""on everybody's case"" to make further progress ahead of the COP26 summit in Scotland later this year. Kirsty McNeill from Crack the Crises, a coalition of charities and NGOs including Save the Children and Oxfam, said the G7 summit was a ""historic missed opportunity"" on Covid-19 and climate change. Leaders arrived ""with good intentions but without their cheque books"", she said. Joanna Rea, from Unicef UK, said the G7 pledge on vaccines was ""the beginning of the action required to end this pandemic"" but called for a ""rapid acceleration of dose sharing in the next three months to ensure millions of vaccines get to the people in countries who need them the most"".
