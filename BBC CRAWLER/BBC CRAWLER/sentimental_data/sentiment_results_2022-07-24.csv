"Mr Lavrov spoke with the head of the Arab League Russia's Foreign Minister, Sergei Lavrov, on a diplomatic offensive in Egypt, has dismissed claims that Moscow caused the global food crisis. In a speech to Arab League ambassadors in Cairo, he said Western nations were distorting the truth about the impact of sanctions on global food security. He accused Western nations of trying to impose their dominance over others. Much of the Arab world and Africa is badly affected by grain shortages caused by Russia's war in Ukraine. A landmark deal signed on Friday to resume Ukraine's grain exports hangs in the balanceafter Russia attacked targets in the port of Odesa on Saturday. Mr Lavrov will go on to visit three African nations to rally support amid anger over the war. Life on the front-line of severe food shortages Mr Lavrov said that Western nations' ""aggressiveness"" in imposing sanctions on Russia indicated one simple conclusion: ""It is not about Ukraine, it is about the future of the world order. ""They say everybody must support a rules-based world order, and the rules are written depending on what specific situation the West wants to resolve in its own favour."" Earlier, Mr Lavrov held talks with his Egyptian counterpart, Sameh Shoukry. Egypt has significant ties with Russia, which supplies wheat, weapons and - until the invasion of Ukraine began - large numbers of tourists. After his talks with Mr Shoukry, Mr Lavrov told a joint news conference that the West was prolonging the conflict even though it understood ""what and whose end it will be"". It is the first stage for Mr Lavrov of a brief tour of Africa taking in Ethiopia, Uganda and Congo-Brazzaville. In an article published by local newspapers in the run-up to his tour, Mr Lavrov said his country had always ""sincerely supported Africans in their struggle for freedom from the colonial yoke"". He added that Russia appreciated Africans' ""balanced position"" on the issue of Ukraine. How much grain is stuck in Ukraine? Ukraine and Russia usually supply more than 40% of Africa's wheat, the African Development Bank says. Egypt is normally a big consumer of Ukrainian wheat. In 2019, it imported 3.62 million tonnes of it, more than any country. But in his article, Mr Lavrov rejected the accusation that Russia was ""exporting famine"" and blamed it on Western propaganda. He added that Western sanctions imposed on Russia had exacerbated ""negative tendencies"" in the international food market that stemmed from the coronavirus pandemic. By Will Ross, Africa regional editor, BBC World Service Sergei Lavrov is trying to convince African countries that they are better off siding with Russia than the West - using phrases like ""we'll help you complete the process of decolonisation"". But it is clear across much of the continent that there is a reluctance to take sides over the war in Ukraine.  The Cold War had a devastating impact, fuelling conflicts in Africa and halting development. Right now, of greatest concern is the spiralling cost of food and fuel.  More than 40% of Africa's wheat comes from Russia and Ukraine. Some African leaders will be aware that when people cannot afford to eat, their own positions in power are less secure.

"Children, some holding empty sacks, wait outside a food aid centre Droughts, Covid-19 and the war in Ukraine have led to severe food shortages in the Horn of Africa, with millions of people going hungry. The BBC's Anne Soy reports from northern Kenya where food is scarce and many are struggling to feed themselves and their families. At a food distribution centre in the village of Kachoda, a mother grins as she receives some grains and cooking oil - but she is too weak to carry it. The package falls to the ground as she tries to lift it to her head. But she is among the lucky few who have been chosen to receive the aid - there are hundreds of people gathered outside the food distribution centre, many of them carrying empty sacks. Hardly any grass can be seen in this dusty and dry area, which is close to the border with Ethiopia and South Sudan. I'm travelling with Samantha Power, administrator for the US Development Agency (USAid). She has called for more international support ""to avoid a hunger catastrophe"" in this region. The US alone cannot meet the demand of people in need of emergency aid in Africa, she says. Back inside the distribution centre, a committee made up of locals in the community has the tough task of deciding who benefits from the scarce supplies. Community leader Enos Lochul has lost his livestock Enos Lochul, the chairman, says they prioritise the most vulnerable. But even he has been personally affected. ""I feel really bad, it burns my heart,"" he says, explaining that he had been reduced to a beggar after prolonged drought wiped out his only source of livelihood - his livestock. ""My children come to me asking for food, but I have no means of providing. I can't help but cry. Tears just flow. They ask for school fees, but I have nothing."" His children have had to drop out of school and his wife has been forced to produce charcoal and fetch firewood to sell. Ms Power, a former US ambassador to the United Nations, says USAID has made a $200m (Â£167m) investment in therapeutic supplements for Kenya, where a million children are malnourished, ""but more is needed"". ""We're talking about the massive loss of livelihood and the risk of the massive loss of life,"" she says. ""And that is why the US has come forward, but the needs here are so much greater than any one country can bear"". Samantha Power, centre, says the stakes are 'existential' Aid agencies including the World Food Programme say that about 50 million people in the Horn of Africa region - that is Somalia, Djibouti, Ethiopia, Kenya, Uganda, South Sudan and Sudan - could face acute food insecurity this year if they don't receive urgent food aid. ""The stakes are existential,"" Ms Power warns. I stand by the gate and watch as the few people who have been chosen to receive the food supplies carry them on their heads or backs. Some use wheelbarrows. Only 15% of the members of the Kachoda community will get food there, an aid worker told me. They include people living with a disability, families that have lost all their livestock and mothers with young children. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""There are severe cases of malnutrition at the community level among the under five years,"" says Emily Emoru, the community health strategy focal person. Several mothers with severely malnourished children meet with Ambassador Power at the Kachoda health centre. One of them was Achwaa Katabo, a mother of eight. Holding her emaciated three-year-old, she explains how whenever she receives food meant to last a month or two, she will still share it with relatives and neighbours, so it runs out within days. All her goats died from starvation. Her child was enrolled for nutritional supplements at the health facility, but Emily says the impact is usually short-lived. ""After being discharged into the community, back in that household where they have nothing to feed on, these children normally relapse,"" she explains.

"This video can not be played A family waiting to board a Eurotunnel train had to wait almost 24 hours in queues There are signs of an easing in the gridlock that has frustrated holidaymakers and hauliers trying to cross the Channel in recent days. The AA motoring group says the time to reach the check-in desk at the Eurotunnel terminal in Folkestone, Kent, is now under two hours. It suggests that if congestion continues to ease, traffic could be back to normal by mid to late evening. It follows three days of tailbacks at the Port of Dover and Folkestone. Overnight, people reported sleeping in cars on the road as the approach to the Eurotunnel remained gridlocked, leading the AA to brand it the ""hotspot of holiday hell"". One tired family said the last three miles of their journey took 21 hours. Traffic built up on the roads leading to the Eurotunnel terminal after the M20 motorway through Kent to the south coast was closed to cars from Maidstone to Folkestone because of Operation Brock, where lorries are diverted to park on the motorway. With the motorway shut, car drivers were diverted to smaller roads which got jammed and caused miles of tailbacks. Shortly before 18:00 BST on Sunday, the National Highways agency tweeted that the coastbound stretch of the M20 between junctions 11 and 12 had reopened to non-freight traffic but it remains closed between junctions 8 and 11. The Kent Resilience Forum, which co-ordinates the county's emergency planning, sent food and drink to people stuck in long traffic queues around Folkestone. Thousands travelling to France face third day of delays Andrew Dyer-Smith and his family, who have travelled to France for their summer holiday, spent 21 hours in bumper-to-bumper traffic on roads around Folkestone. ""We arrived at Folkestone at 9am yesterday morning for a train at 10.30 and then have been slowly crawling along for the last 21-plus hours,"" he told the BBC. He said his children were dishevelled but had managed some sleep, while he and his wife had taken the wheel in shifts to snatch some rest. While speaking live to the BBC, the family erupted in cheers as they were finally able to board the train. John Keefe, Eurotunnel's director of public affairs, said he was confident the ""bit we manage"" - from check-in to departure - was working. ""The roads outside are beyond our remit. We're responsible for managing the service - it's the only place we have any responsibility, any authority,"" he said. He said passengers were always told to turn up 30 minutes to two hours before departure to ensure they got on. But one frustrated listener said it took four hours to get on a train, on top of 15 hours trying to move five miles outside Folkestone. ""They left us on those roads - elderly, those with disabilities, families, children,"" she said. ""The children were getting into their pyjamas at the side of the road and brushing their teeth where every man, woman and child had been using the bathroom."" She added that the queues on the A20 coming into the terminal were all Eurotunnel's passengers with no water, no facilities, nothing. ""We were treated worse than cattle,"" she said. This video can not be played Watch: Aerial footage of thousands of lorries stacked on M20 outside Dover Problems began on Friday, and a major incident was declared as routes to the port and Eurotunnel became gridlocked. The Dover delays led to a war of words between French and UK officials, with both sides blaming the other. The UK government said French authorities failed to provide enough border staff to check passports at Dover over the weekend. But French Transport Minister Clement Beaune rejected this and highlighted additional border checks brought on by Brexit. By mid-morning on Sunday, the port said it had cleared the backlog of tourist passengers and was running as normal. On the M20, many of the lorries have been released but 600 still remain, according to the Kent Resilience Forum. Operation Brock involves EU-bound lorries parking on an M20 carriageway until space becomes available for a Channel crossing on the ferry from Dover or on the Eurotunnel. Steve Gooding, of the RAC Foundation, blamed the operation for ""massive disruption"" and called for government investment for extra lorry parking. Natalie Chapman, from haulier group Logistics UK, said some lorry drivers had waited for ""well over 18 hours"" in queues over the weekend with no toilet facilities. Kent County Council and the Road Haulage Association also want the government to build more lorry parks. The Department for Transport said it was investing more than Â£30m to improve facilities in England. Father-of-three Manesh Luthra left Essex with his family for their summer holiday at 4am on Saturday. Within two hours, they were just outside the Eurotunnel terminal in Folkestone, and were hopeful they would make their 7.50am shuttle. But, as he tells the BBC: ""We joined the back of the queue for what was the worst 21 hours experienced. ""We moved metres in hours."" His family wanted to give up at times because there was no information, support or supplies, he said. Other drivers were cutting into the queue, he adds. ""It was savage, I was worried there would be an accident."" The family eventually got to France at 10pm and travelled two more hours, but were so exhausted they stopped overnight at a hotel in Rouen, northern France. On Sunday morning, they set off again. ""I'm calm now but at various points we all broke down,"" says Manesh. Has your journey been affected by the delays crossing the Channel?

At least eight hectares of land were affected by the blaze that started around midday at Hankley Common near Farnham on Sunday. A major incident was declared and although that has now ended, people are still being warned to avoid the area. There were separate blazes in Rammey Marsh, Enfield, at Cranford Park, Hayes, and at Burgate in Suffolk. In Surrey, people reported seeing smoke over Guildford, Woking and Addlestone and on the M25 near Chertsey. Firefighters were called just after midday and the fire service has said it expects crews to remain at the scene until at least Monday. The cause of the blaze is unknown.

The 24-year-old, from Alton in Hampshire, said at about lunchtime he saw ""huge smoke clouds building to the east of Lasham Airfield"" where he works. ""After take-off I could see that the fire was covering a wide area with the smoke extending downwind over Guildford and Woking towards London,"" he added. ""Obviously [I was] concerned for all involved in the local area given the already stretched resources of local fire services."" The extent of the blaze on Hankley Common can be seen from this angle Crews tackled a blaze on the same stretch of land on Wednesday whenfour hectares of Hankley Common near Elstead caught fire. After that incident, the service warned that despite overnight rain, more warm weather was expected and vegetation remained extremely dry, urging the public not to use barbeques and to take care. Hankley Common - known for its appearance in the Bond film Skyfall - is a heathland habitat and home to ground-nesting birds including nightjars and skylarks. It is owned by the Ministry of Defence and is used for training exercises. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"This video can not be played Watch: Girls Aloud gather in Hyde Park to remember Sarah Harding Hundreds of people, including three members of Girls Aloud, have gathered in Hyde Park to take part in a memorial run for Sarah Harding. The singer, 39, died in September, a year after revealing she had breast cancer. Bandmates Nicola Roberts, Cheryl and Nadine Coyle were at the Race For Life For Sarah, a 5k Cancer Research run. A huge pink-clad crowd took part in London, and others, including Kimberley Walsh, joined in remotely. Girls Aloud star Sarah Harding dies aged 39 How Sarah Harding helped change pop music Cheryl and Girls Aloud bandmates lead Harding tributes Cheryl said she still cannot quite believe the death of her bandmate. Pictured here in 2018, Sarah Harding died in September 2021 ""It doesn't feel like she's gone at all. To be honest, I've never experienced or anticipated this grief. ""You know, I've lost grandparents when I was younger and I lost a friend when I was younger but nothing like this, the feeling of shock and disbelief and it still lingers now to be honest. I still can't quite believe it's real."" Hundreds of people took part in the Race For Life earlier Nicola Roberts spoke of Harding's ""electric"" personality: ""Sarah's energy was like a firework so I feel like that huge difference in energy when she's not there. ""I think that for us right now, we don't feel like Girls Aloud. We don't feel like a band without Sarah. She, like I said just now, she was such a huge part of our energy that it doesn't feel like that."" Nadine Coyle said she was ""in denial"" about bandmate Sarah Harding's illness: ""This time last year we were actually hanging out. ""We all met up last year. She was there and we were talking and she didn't even seem that sick. ""I was in denial the entire time and was the friend that was 'Oh, it's gonna be all right', you know, I was completely in denial right up until the day she passed."" Nicola Roberts said Harding's energy was ""like a firework"" Daniel Rosney, BBC Entertainment reporter at Hyde Park This was the first time fans were able to meet with members of Girls Aloud to mark and celebrate Sarah's life since her death last year. Some had travelled from across the UK, others had flown from Israel and Spain. Ahead of the race Sound of the Underground and Love Machine - two of the girlband's biggest hits - were played to get the participants warmed up as Cheryl, Nicola and Nadine thanked those for raising money and awareness. Kimberley was unable to take part but did the run on her family holiday - starting at the same time as those in Hyde Park - sharing her route on an Instagram live. Speaking to the BBC, Cheryl said ""it doesn't feel like Girls Aloud without Sarah"" while Nadine added: ""I often think of her at a health retreat in Thailand somewhere but then you think that's not the way it is."" More than 1,000 people completed the 5km route with many wearing Girls Aloud T-shirts or banners with Sarah's face on it. And there were others who were proudly wearing the lyrics Sarah sings on the hit The Promise. ""Here I am, walking primrose, wondering when I'm gunna see you again."" Girls Aloud last performed together in 2013 - marking 10 years since they were formed on Popstars: The Rivals The most common sign of breast cancer is a lump or thickening in the breast - but there are other symptoms too. Change in size or feel of the breast Changes in the skin of the breast, such as dimpling or redness Fluid leaking from the nipple, outside of pregnancy or breast feedin Change in position of the nipple These symptoms can be caused by other conditions, so it is important to get any lumps or changes checked by a doctor. Breast cancer is the most common cancer in the UK, with women over 50 more at risk than the under-40s. But there are many other factors that can increase a person's risk, including a family history of cancer and being overweight.

"In an interview last week the British model spoke for the first time about the raid on her west London mansion Tamara Ecclestone has offered a reward of up to Â£6m for the return of her Â£25m stolen jewellery. Three Italian men have been jailed for their part in the biggest domestic burglary in English legal history. In December 2019 Ms Ecclestone's west London mansion was one of three celebrity homes targeted and raided by the international thieves. Ms Ecclestone said she was offering the reward ""Mel Gibson-style from the movie Ransom"" to get her jewellery back. The socialite and former model said she would ""happily put up 25% of the value of anything that police are able to recover"". The bizarre clue which solved Tamara Ecclestone's stolen diamonds case,external Posting on Instagram Ms Ecclestone, the daughter of ex-Formula 1 Group chief executive, Bernie Ecclestone, wrote: ""If you are the source, you get the reward. It is that simple. ""With the total value of the burglary being Â£26m - that's a reward of up to Â£6m for anyone that can help me get back what is rightfully mine."" Who Stole Tamara Ecclestone's Diamonds? Who is really behind Britain's biggest ever burglary? The police, the victims and even the suspects talk for the first time about the Â£26m series of raids on celebrity homes.

"Muslim Hikers on their way up Cader Idris in Snowdonia When was the last time you went for a walk in the countryside? Perhaps you stuck your hiking boots on, grabbed a waterproof (this is Britain...) and jumped in the car at the weekend for a few hours of fresh air and glorious landscapes. But what if you don't have a car? Or hiking boots? Or even a suitable coat? What if you don't have the money to buy a bus ticket or there aren't any buses where you live? Maybe you're disabled. Maybe you don't see any people who look like you in the countryside and don't feel you fit in. Hiking 'completely changed my life' Woman inspired to create Muslim hiking group For sections of the population, the countryside is not a place they can access or feel comfortable in. Haroon Mota is doing his best to change that for people in the Muslim community. A lover of the outdoors, the former charity events organiser noticed he rarely saw other people ""looking like me"", as he puts it, when he was out walking and wanted to do something to change that. Haroon Mota founded Muslim Hikers to encourage more people ""who looked like me"" to go country walking When the pandemic began, he started the Instagram groupMuslim Hikers,external""just for the sake of sharing positive vibes and encouraging people to get outside more"". ""There was plenty of documented cases of loneliness and isolation and I wanted to address that and share stories of positive role modelsâ¦ just to try and normalise being outdoors for our communities which evidently isn't quite the norm and why such under-representation exists."" The page ""blew up"" and people were ""flocking to our page"", not just from the UK but globally. ""My favourite place to hike is Snowdon, so our first hike was up Snowdon in July just last year,"" he said. ""We had 80 people from across the UK who'd travelled to join us for our first hike and it was just beautiful, especially having just emerged from the pandemic and seeing all of these online people by their Instagram names. seeing them for real, like 'oh yeah, you're that Hijabi Hiker on Instagram and you're Brother Mountain Beard' and all these funny Instagram names."" The group's monthly hikes attract up to 150 people and they visit national parks across the UK, including one at Cadair Idris and a second Snowdon hike last month. A group of women on the first ever Muslim Hikers trek up Snowdon in 2021 ""In terms of reception [in Wales], when we're outdoors the people we meet are always pleasant. People are keen to know who are this big group of people and why are we here, and people love what we're doing."" But it's not just the organised hikes that are the point of Muslim Hikers andActive Inclusion Network,external, the community interest company he now runs to promote getting outdoors to diverse audiences. Nature deficit 'harming children' 'Why I'm a wild camper' ""The idea is to empower them so that they have the awareness and confidence to be able to do this independently, whether that's solo travel or coming back with their friends or their family. ""We see [from social media] that people who have met on our hikes are then going on to do their own hikes in smaller friend circles which is always nice to see."" Many more followed in their footsteps this June for the second Snowdon hike Haroon has faced questions about why the group is called Muslim Hikers and whether faith matters in this context. ""I think it's got everything to do with it,"" he said. ""Under-representation exists, barriers exist, these are real problems and issues and I think we are tackling it head-on."" He said many people attending the hikes were visiting a national park for the first time and it was easier being in a supportive environment with other newcomers. ""We want to facilitate and nurture relationships with these national parks so that people can see these as places where they feel comfortable and happy, where they feel safe and where they feel that they can belong."" A2018 report,externalfrom the Welsh government establishing priorities for Wales' national parks and areas of outstanding natural beauty (AONBs) highlighted another section of society which needed help with countryside access. It said: ""While it is important for all sectors of society to experience these designated landscapes, particular focus should be given to children and young families from deprived areas. Action must be taken to help to tackle the inequalities that exist in health, education and economic outcomes amongst the poorest in society."" A keen walker, Darren Bartley tries to give the same experience to the young people he works with Down in south Wales, Darren Bartley devotes large parts of his working life to trying to realise this ambition and foster a similar relationship with the countryside for young people who, through social background, have fewer chances of experiencing it. As an engagement and participant officer for children's services at Neath Port Talbot council, he has set up a number of groups for young people who have been in care or receive other kinds of support. Two of them, Hope, a girls' rights group, and a young person's panel called Youth Voice Matters, are taking part in an outdoor festival calledGreen Spaces, Dark Skies,external, which is designed to encourage diverse groups of people to experience the natural environment, particularly those who might not be frequent visitors. It is running a series of outdoor events across the UK, with three in Wales in Gower, the Brecon Beacons and Anglesey. The events take place as darkness is falling and all participants carry specially designed low-emission torches which are used to create a filmed light and sound experience. Darren, a keen walker, said spending time in the natural environment for the young people he worked with did wonders for their mental health. Nature ""is like a magic pill"" for helping young people with their mental health, Darren says ""A lot of the children I work with are incredibly vulnerable or have had difficult backgrounds, hence a lot are in care. They don't always get to access the outdoors and the benefits that I know, and pass on to my own children. ""If you were to look at their personal lives, unless these things were put on, and buses put on and everything spoon-fed to some of the families, they would never go to a country park,"" he said. ""There's lots of outdoor spaces of natural beauty in Neath Port Talbot and they're on the doorstep for many of these communities but [the young people] never get to go to them. ""It definitely empowers them. It's a huge effort for them to try something new, to go to the Beacons or the coast, it's really out of their comfort zone... but for this group they're starting to value the fun things that are on and can be done in the parks and nature. ""There must be millions and millions poured into throwing medication at people's mental health problems but that could just be [put into] proper transport links to these places, which would have a far more profound effect on families and their relationships, and having fun and their mental health and well-being. ""Transport is a huge issue, especially in somewhere like Neath Port Talbot because you have all these valleys and everything's a drama to get to. It's not as straightforward as if you live in a city for example."" Giving young people from deprived areas access to the national parks is a Welsh government priority His group has just secured some funding which they hope to use to bulk-buy walking gear for the children so they cannot ""make it an excuse for not coming"". ""I must have a fortune's worth of kit in my wardrobe because I can go out in all weathers - some of these children don't even have the proper coat to go to school in, let alone go to the Brecon Beacons in."" Getting out on walks ""in the middle of nowhere"" also gave the young people the opportunity to talk. ""They get things off their chest,"" Darren said. ""You just walk alongside someone for five minutes and they do offload a little bit or you get to know them a little bit better. It just builds more of a relationship up, from a professional point of view."" Having access to transport is a key issue for the people who come along to the Healthy Lives project in Brecon, Powys, part of BCA advocacy services for people with learning disabilities, where project coordinator Catherine Povey works. Like the children from south Wales, members of the group have been participating in the Green Spaces, Dark Skies events, and took part in preparatory workshops involving creating recordings, poetry and willow weaving. The group generally did a ""lot of going outdoors"", Catherine said, adding: ""We went and did a bit of forest bathing the other day. We had a very slow walk so people who were less physically able came along and we took our time. ""People started stopping and closing their eyes and just saying, 'listen to the birds, I live in the town now, this is just so peaceful'. People started stroking trees, somebody started sniffing things and saying, 'smell this' - it was total immersion. ""People walk and talk - that's a big thing, I think. It's a big social for everybody."" Catherine Povey wants to improve disabled access in the outdoors but preserve wildness as well Some of the group can catch buses independently while others have private vehicles available to them, but a lack of transport adds another layer to the barriers some face. ""The biggest problem we've got is public transport actually, which is the same as for everybody,"" she explained. ""Today, for example, we're going on a canal walk and we're going to go by bus because we don't have a minibus and a lot of people won't have their own transport. ""But the last bus is coming back at half past three, so we've got to finish at half past three, and that's the end of it."" Members of the Health Lives group are ""really, really keen to be outside"" Although the group is for people with learning disabilities, some of those attending will also have reduced mobility, which adds another challenge. ""We have some people in wheelchairs and some with rollators, some people who need a stick. We did a walk where we split the group into lower mobility and higher mobility, but even for those with more mobility [who went away from accessible paths], there were still stiles to get over, and some people, like the rest of us, are not as fit as they could be,"" she explained. As a freelance mountain leader and outdoor pursuits leader in her a different role however, Catherine is mindful of the fact that not everywhere can be accessible. ""It is a bit of a balance. You can't make all the wild places accessible to everybody or then they are no longer wild. You can't have signposts and paths and trains going to the top of every mountain."" But she would like to see more provision, with some areas made accessible so ""everyone gets the chance to experience the wild"". ""Once you get up into the mountains, looking around you don't have to go up every single one, do you? You're looking around, you're in them."" Healthy Lives member Andrea Davies took part in the Green Spaces Dark Skies project Group member Andrea Davies, 53, has fond memories of walking and swimming in the countryside as a child with her family and getting into nature now can help bring those back. Although she can catch the bus herself to go for walks, she said the services were not frequent enough and also thinks better wheelchair provision could help with countryside access. Asked what she liked about being in nature, she said walking and looking at trees. ""I usually guess what trees [are which] by looking at them,"" she added. ""I like birds. I like whistling to them, because I don't talk tremendously.""

"This video can not be played Gauging the summer cost of living With holiday season in full swing, BBC Scotland's consumer affairs correspondent Connor Gillies has taken a trip of his own. He wanted to find out how people across the country are coping with the rising price of energy, food and fuel. In four locations over four days, the phrase ""cost of living"" was greeted with a dreadfully familiar sigh from everyone we met. From Millport on the Isle of Cumbrae, to the Kelpies in Falkirk, Pitlochry and Fort William, our journey showed that every community in Scotland has a unique experience of this crisis. Gordon and Seonaide Barclay from Saltcoats, were on holiday in Pitlochry I met Ayrshire couple Gordon and Seonaid Barclay at a caravan park in Pitlochry. They described the current price rises and the impact it is having on their lives as ""horrible"". Seonaid said: ""I shop around now and look for cheaper prices in different shops. Before I would do all my shopping in Asda, now I go around all different shops looking for cheaper prices. ""You go in and it used to be a dozen eggs for Â£1, now it's Â£1.25/ Â£1.30. I used to get my wee boy a tub of fruit that used to be a pound, now it's Â£1.50. That's a big jump."" Dad Gordon told me he uses price comparison websites for almost everything in life these days. It is all about saving every penny and pound possible. The NHS worker said: ""We are actually in a worse state now than we were after World War Two. ""Today's standards of living are going through the floor. You have today's society going to food banks which is disgusting."" There is no petrol station on the Clyde coast island of Cumbrae. It has a population of just over 1,000 people, but it is extremely popular with day trippers. We heard the tale of the local electrician who has ditched his van because he can't afford to top up the fuel anymore. A story echoed by the island's delivery driver who cut back his trips on the ferry to the mainland because the cost was mounting up. Locals don't get a discount on the eight minute Calmac crossing - meaning it's at least Â£15 to take the car on and off. Scott Ferris owns a bike shop in Millport Scott Ferris runs one of the local bike shops in Millport. He is doing a roaring trade as visitors come to the island especially to do the 10 mile circular loop. A once affordable day trip is creeping up in cost. The price of hiring a bike is up as much as 15% as firms try to grapple with price rises. Scott told us: ""On a very sunny day we can do up to 300 bikes a day, up to 5,000 people will travel to the island on a good day. ""Prices have had to go up again from parts, staff, fuel, all those costs have raised in the last couple of years and any away-days for families becoming more and more expensive will make it a difficult choice for them to have to make - stay at home or go away spend money they potentially don't  have."" Gordon Allan of Falkirk butcher firm Malcolm Allan Tucked away in an industrial estate in Larbert near Falkirk is the factory for Malcolm Allan butchers. They are well known for their blue-boxed steak pies and Scottish cooked breakfast packs, which are found on the shelves of all major supermarkets. I met boss Gordon Allan who gives a stark reminder that businesses aren't protected with an energy price cap like consumers. He told me: ""We were Â£6,500 a week for electricity, now we've gone to Â£13,500 and this week with the hot weather we are Â£15,000 for the week. It's bonkers. Everybody seems to be just burying their heads in the sand and thinking it will go away. It's not going away. ""We've changed all our working patterns, we work one factory two days a week, we work our bakery four days a week. We used to be seven days a week production."" Gordon's story of survival chimes with the reality facing many firms just now. A precarious financial situation means sacrifices along the way. He continued: ""We've looked at every aspect of our business from packaging - we'll stop putting all our steak pies in cardboard boxes from 1 August that will save some money. ""But why should we have to? I like my products in cardboard boxes, the customers like our products in cardboard boxes"" Frazer Scott from Energy Action Scotland speaks to Connor at The Kelpies Along the road in the shadow of the Forth Valley's mighty Grangemouth oil refinery are the Kelpies and the Helix park. A place where families can enjoy a free day out at a time when budgets are restricted. We set up our BBC Scotland News red deck chairs and encouraged people to pose their questions to expert Frazer Scott from the charity Energy Action Scotland. The overriding thought was one of why are gas and electricity bills increasing so much? Others wanted Frazer to provide the best tips on cutting their energy usage to save where they could. Alan Chilton donated a fajita kit and took some eggs from a community larder in Pitlochry Outside the entrance to the Atholl Centre in Pitlochry is a shed with no door. It is known as the ""community larder"" where people can drop in 24 hours a day, seven days a week for free food. There are shelves stacked with rolls, cakes, fruit and veg all coming towards their use-by dates. The local supermarket supplies the goods in the hope of cutting down on waste. A quirky concept saving people, like Allan Chilton, money. The 30-year-old, who relied heavily on this larder during lockdown when he lost his job, turned up with a fajita kit in his hands ready to donate for someone else to feel the benefit of. He then picked up some eggs before heading up to the village to do his shopping. It saves him buying them. The cost of living means people are trying to see how they can stretch out their money. Tourism is the lifeblood of the local economy in Fort William and across Lochaber. Jobs and livelihoods rely on it. Locals told me they really struggled during the height of the pandemic when overseas visitors were banned from coming here. It's a very different story now. The high street was an eclectic mix of foreign accents and the roads full of European number plates. Business is back. Sophie and Alicia Zieman, from Kentucky, were on holiday in Fort William We went to the platform where the Jacobite Steam train was waiting to depart. A magnet for tourists who recognise the burgundy carriages and black-polished engine from the famous Harry Potter films. I met Alicia Zieman and her daughter Sophie who had arrived this week from the US state of Kentucky. She said ""We will go out to eat in the restaurants here but not as much as we used to before. ""We are staying in a hotel here and the price has gone up. We were just talking about that with our cab driver on the way here"" Mathieu, Etienne and Alban are making packed lunches rather than eating out at cafes We also stumbled across French dad Mathieu Percot and his young sons Etienne and Alban, who were kitted out in their Hogwarts robes. They told me how they now make packed lunches to save money rather than stopping in the local cafes. They visit budget supermarkets in Fort William in the morning for supplies whereas before they would have stopped for food in local places. The Scottish Tourism Alliance recently reported half of its members suggesting consumer spending is down 50% on pre-pandemic levels. An indication of changing habits on this financial journey which is no where near the end. How are you dealing with the rising cost of living?

The singer, 39, died in September, a year after revealing she had breast cancer. Bandmates Nicola Roberts, Cheryl and Nadine Coyle were at the Race For Life For Sarah, a 5k Cancer Research run. A huge pink-clad crowd took part in London, and others, including Kimberley Walsh, joined in remotely. Girls Aloud star Sarah Harding dies aged 39 How Sarah Harding helped change pop music Cheryl and Girls Aloud bandmates lead Harding tributes Cheryl said she still cannot quite believe the death of her bandmate. Pictured here in 2018, Sarah Harding died in September 2021 ""It doesn't feel like she's gone at all. To be honest, I've never experienced or anticipated this grief. ""You know, I've lost grandparents when I was younger and I lost a friend when I was younger but nothing like this, the feeling of shock and disbelief and it still lingers now to be honest. I still can't quite believe it's real."" Hundreds of people took part in the Race For Life earlier Nicola Roberts spoke of Harding's ""electric"" personality: ""Sarah's energy was like a firework so I feel like that huge difference in energy when she's not there. ""I think that for us right now, we don't feel like Girls Aloud. We don't feel like a band without Sarah. She, like I said just now, she was such a huge part of our energy that it doesn't feel like that."" Nadine Coyle said she was ""in denial"" about bandmate Sarah Harding's illness: ""This time last year we were actually hanging out. ""We all met up last year. She was there and we were talking and she didn't even seem that sick. ""I was in denial the entire time and was the friend that was 'Oh, it's gonna be all right', you know, I was completely in denial right up until the day she passed."" Nicola Roberts said Harding's energy was ""like a firework"" Daniel Rosney, BBC Entertainment reporter at Hyde Park This was the first time fans were able to meet with members of Girls Aloud to mark and celebrate Sarah's life since her death last year. Some had travelled from across the UK, others had flown from Israel and Spain. Ahead of the race Sound of the Underground and Love Machine - two of the girlband's biggest hits - were played to get the participants warmed up as Cheryl, Nicola and Nadine thanked those for raising money and awareness. Kimberley was unable to take part but did the run on her family holiday - starting at the same time as those in Hyde Park - sharing her route on an Instagram live. Speaking to the BBC, Cheryl said ""it doesn't feel like Girls Aloud without Sarah"" while Nadine added: ""I often think of her at a health retreat in Thailand somewhere but then you think that's not the way it is."" More than 1,000 people completed the 5km route with many wearing Girls Aloud T-shirts or banners with Sarah's face on it. And there were others who were proudly wearing the lyrics Sarah sings on the hit The Promise. ""Here I am, walking primrose, wondering when I'm gunna see you again."" Girls Aloud last performed together in 2013 - marking 10 years since they were formed on Popstars: The Rivals The most common sign of breast cancer is a lump or thickening in the breast - but there are other symptoms too. Change in size or feel of the breast Changes in the skin of the breast, such as dimpling or redness Fluid leaking from the nipple, outside of pregnancy or breast feedin Change in position of the nipple These symptoms can be caused by other conditions, so it is important to get any lumps or changes checked by a doctor. Breast cancer is the most common cancer in the UK, with women over 50 more at risk than the under-40s. But there are many other factors that can increase a person's risk, including a family history of cancer and being overweight. Many treatments are available for breast cancer and survival is generally good if the disease is detected early. Follow BBC London onFacebook,external,Twitter,externalandInstagram,external.

"This video can not be played Watch: Grass fires break out in Surrey and London Firefighters are to stay overnight to monitor the aftermath of a large grass fire at a Surrey beauty spot. At least eight hectares of land were affected by the blaze that started around midday at Hankley Common near Farnham on Sunday. A major incident was declared and although that has now ended, people are still being warned to avoid the area. There were separate blazes in Rammey Marsh, Enfield, at Cranford Park, Hayes, and at Burgate in Suffolk. In Surrey, people reported seeing smoke over Guildford, Woking and Addlestone and on the M25 near Chertsey. Firefighters were called just after midday and the fire service has said it expects crews to remain at the scene until at least Monday. The cause of the blaze is unknown. People are being asked to call 999 only if they see fire but not to report smoke. Surrey Policetweeted,externalthat it was assisting fire crews and had closed Thursley Road. The force asked people to stay away while emergency teams have dealt with the incident. Smoke from Hankley Common could be seen for miles around People were warned about the dangers of a ""great deal of smoke"" Flying instructor Jordan Bridge said the blaze was one of the largest he has seen in the area. The 24-year-old, from Alton in Hampshire, said at about lunchtime he saw ""huge smoke clouds building to the east of Lasham Airfield"" where he works. ""After take-off I could see that the fire was covering a wide area with the smoke extending downwind over Guildford and Woking towards London,"" he added. ""Obviously [I was] concerned for all involved in the local area given the already stretched resources of local fire services."" The extent of the blaze on Hankley Common can be seen from this angle Crews tackled a blaze on the same stretch of land on Wednesday whenfour hectares of Hankley Common near Elstead caught fire. After that incident, the service warned that despite overnight rain, more warm weather was expected and vegetation remained extremely dry, urging the public not to use barbeques and to take care. Hankley Common - known for its appearance in the Bond film Skyfall - is a heathland habitat and home to ground-nesting birds including nightjars and skylarks.

"This video can not be played A family waiting to board a Eurotunnel train had to wait almost 24 hours in queues There are signs of an easing in the gridlock that has frustrated holidaymakers and hauliers trying to cross the Channel in recent days. The AA motoring group says the time to reach the check-in desk at the Eurotunnel terminal in Folkestone, Kent, is now under two hours. It suggests that if congestion continues to ease, traffic could be back to normal by mid to late evening. It follows three days of tailbacks at the Port of Dover and Folkestone. Overnight, people reported sleeping in cars on the road as the approach to the Eurotunnel remained gridlocked, leading the AA to brand it the ""hotspot of holiday hell"". One tired family said the last three miles of their journey took 21 hours. Traffic built up on the roads leading to the Eurotunnel terminal after the M20 motorway through Kent to the south coast was closed to cars from Maidstone to Folkestone because of Operation Brock, where lorries are diverted to park on the motorway. With the motorway shut, car drivers were diverted to smaller roads which got jammed and caused miles of tailbacks. Shortly before 18:00 BST on Sunday, the National Highways agency tweeted that the coastbound stretch of the M20 between junctions 11 and 12 had reopened to non-freight traffic but it remains closed between junctions 8 and 11. The Kent Resilience Forum, which co-ordinates the county's emergency planning, sent food and drink to people stuck in long traffic queues around Folkestone. Thousands travelling to France face third day of delays Andrew Dyer-Smith and his family, who have travelled to France for their summer holiday, spent 21 hours in bumper-to-bumper traffic on roads around Folkestone. ""We arrived at Folkestone at 9am yesterday morning for a train at 10.30 and then have been slowly crawling along for the last 21-plus hours,"" he told the BBC. He said his children were dishevelled but had managed some sleep, while he and his wife had taken the wheel in shifts to snatch some rest. While speaking live to the BBC, the family erupted in cheers as they were finally able to board the train. John Keefe, Eurotunnel's director of public affairs, said he was confident the ""bit we manage"" - from check-in to departure - was working. ""The roads outside are beyond our remit. We're responsible for managing the service - it's the only place we have any responsibility, any authority,"" he said. He said passengers were always told to turn up 30 minutes to two hours before departure to ensure they got on. But one frustrated listener said it took four hours to get on a train, on top of 15 hours trying to move five miles outside Folkestone. ""They left us on those roads - elderly, those with disabilities, families, children,"" she said. ""The children were getting into their pyjamas at the side of the road and brushing their teeth where every man, woman and child had been using the bathroom."" She added that the queues on the A20 coming into the terminal were all Eurotunnel's passengers with no water, no facilities, nothing. ""We were treated worse than cattle,"" she said. This video can not be played Watch: Aerial footage of thousands of lorries stacked on M20 outside Dover Problems began on Friday, and a major incident was declared as routes to the port and Eurotunnel became gridlocked. The Dover delays led to a war of words between French and UK officials, with both sides blaming the other. The UK government said French authorities failed to provide enough border staff to check passports at Dover over the weekend. But French Transport Minister Clement Beaune rejected this and highlighted additional border checks brought on by Brexit. By mid-morning on Sunday, the port said it had cleared the backlog of tourist passengers and was running as normal. On the M20, many of the lorries have been released but 600 still remain, according to the Kent Resilience Forum. Operation Brock involves EU-bound lorries parking on an M20 carriageway until space becomes available for a Channel crossing on the ferry from Dover or on the Eurotunnel. Steve Gooding, of the RAC Foundation, blamed the operation for ""massive disruption"" and called for government investment for extra lorry parking. Natalie Chapman, from haulier group Logistics UK, said some lorry drivers had waited for ""well over 18 hours"" in queues over the weekend with no toilet facilities. Kent County Council and the Road Haulage Association also want the government to build more lorry parks. The Department for Transport said it was investing more than Â£30m to improve facilities in England. Father-of-three Manesh Luthra left Essex with his family for their summer holiday at 4am on Saturday. Within two hours, they were just outside the Eurotunnel terminal in Folkestone, and were hopeful they would make their 7.50am shuttle. But, as he tells the BBC: ""We joined the back of the queue for what was the worst 21 hours experienced. ""We moved metres in hours."" His family wanted to give up at times because there was no information, support or supplies, he said. Other drivers were cutting into the queue, he adds. ""It was savage, I was worried there would be an accident."" The family eventually got to France at 10pm and travelled two more hours, but were so exhausted they stopped overnight at a hotel in Rouen, northern France. On Sunday morning, they set off again. ""I'm calm now but at various points we all broke down,"" says Manesh. Has your journey been affected by the delays crossing the Channel?

"Aran Chada was on holiday with his partner and two children A British man is feared to have drowned after jumping from a boat in Italy to save his son. Aran Chada, from Leicestershire, was at Lake Garda on holiday with his partner and two children, the local coastguard told the BBC. The family had rented a boat on Friday when Mr Chada's son got into trouble off the coast of the resort of Limone. It is thought the holiday was organised to celebrate Mr Chada's birthday on Tuesday, when he is due to turn 52. The coastguard told the BBC that Mr Chada's partner raised the alarm by phoning 112, the European emergency number. The family rented a boat while on holiday next to Lake Garda They said Mr Chada ""saved his son"" but then ""disappeared"" near the boat. A witnesstold local media,external: ""The mother screamed and the father jumped into the water."" The coastguard said it immediately sent one of its boats, which had been on patrol in the area. ""As soon as they arrived in the waters in front of Limone, the coastguard rescuers reached the pleasure craft and tried to acquire from the missing person's wife the precise point from where the victim had never emerged,"" the coastguard told BBC News. Searches for Mr Chada are continuing at Lake Garda A helicopter and divers from the fire service also joined efforts to find Mr Chada. Searches were still under way on Sunday, with the coastguard, fire brigade and police all involved. The coastguard said operations would continue over the next few days.

"Sir William was described as ""a giant character"" by DUP MP Ian Paisley Wrightbus founder and former unionist councillor Sir William Wright has died. Sir William founded the Ballymena, County Antrim, bus manufacturing firm with his father, Robert, in a tin shed in 1946. He was knighted in the Queen's 2018 New Years Honours for services to the economy and the bus industry. DUP MP Ian Paisley said he was ""one of the last true captains of industry and commerce and a man who has left his mark, not just locally but globally"". ""Sir William was a giant character,"" added Mr Paisley. ""I have had the honour of knowing him and his family for decades. He was both a political and business leader. ""He cared passionately about the employment and skills training of local people. He loved Northern Ireland and he was dedicated in everything that he did."" Sir William met the Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall when the couple visited a Wrightbus factory in 2013 Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) North Antrim assembly member Robin Swann said Sir William's death was a ""tremendous loss, not just to his family circle but also to unionism, the business community, the Loyal Orders and the Christian Church"". ""Sir William Wright will rank as one of north Antrim's most legendary figures,"" he said. ""He built Wrightbus into a global brand and his dedication to unionism was also known throughout the globe, especially in his past role as a Ballymena councillor."" Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV) leader and North Antrim assembly member, Jim Allister, said Sir William was ""an iconic giant in Ballymena and Northern Ireland"". ""No-one has left a more endeavoured mark on the economy than Sir William,"" Mr Allister said. ""Many people had very good jobs in Ballymena and got many years of employment thanks to his contribution. ""He was also very much involved in the local community, he served as a councillor at a time and was very prominent in his faith."" Wrightbus founder supports UK exit from EU In 2019, Wrightbus was at the centre ofa storm over Green Pastures Church in Ballymena. Sir William's son, Jeff, was majority shareholder of Wrightbus and pastor at the church at the time. WhenWrightbus went into administration, the family cited a fall in demand for buses as the reason for the collapse of the business, but many workers expressed concern that money donated to the church had weakened the business. Sir William Wright was applauded by many Wrightbus employees who protested over job losses in 2019 Patricia O'Lynn, Alliance Party MLA for North Antrim, said ""many constituents/friends have been employed by Wrightbus throughout the years"". ""A major aspect of his legacy will be the industrial advancement of electric/hydrogen-powered buses."" She sent her condolences to Sir William's loved ones. Translink chief executive Chris Conway said that Sir William ""made a huge contribution to the bus industry globally and the NI economy"" and described his passing as ""very sad news"".

At least eight hectares of land were affected by the blaze that started around midday at Hankley Common near Farnham on Sunday. A major incident was declared and although that has now ended, people are still being warned to avoid the area. There were separate blazes in Rammey Marsh, Enfield, at Cranford Park, Hayes, and at Burgate in Suffolk. In Surrey, people reported seeing smoke over Guildford, Woking and Addlestone and on the M25 near Chertsey.

The 24-year-old, from Alton in Hampshire, said at about lunchtime he saw ""huge smoke clouds building to the east of Lasham Airfield"" where he works. ""After take-off I could see that the fire was covering a wide area with the smoke extending downwind over Guildford and Woking towards London,"" he added. ""Obviously [I was] concerned for all involved in the local area given the already stretched resources of local fire services."" The extent of the blaze on Hankley Common can be seen from this angle Crews tackled a blaze on the same stretch of land on Wednesday whenfour hectares of Hankley Common near Elstead caught fire. After that incident, the service warned that despite overnight rain, more warm weather was expected and vegetation remained extremely dry, urging the public not to use barbeques and to take care.

"Mr Lavrov spoke with the head of the Arab League Russia's Foreign Minister, Sergei Lavrov, on a diplomatic offensive in Egypt, has dismissed claims that Moscow caused the global food crisis. In a speech to Arab League ambassadors in Cairo, he said Western nations were distorting the truth about the impact of sanctions on global food security. He accused Western nations of trying to impose their dominance over others. Much of the Arab world and Africa is badly affected by grain shortages caused by Russia's war in Ukraine. A landmark deal signed on Friday to resume Ukraine's grain exports hangs in the balanceafter Russia attacked targets in the port of Odesa on Saturday. Mr Lavrov will go on to visit three African nations to rally support amid anger over the war. Life on the front-line of severe food shortages Mr Lavrov said that Western nations' ""aggressiveness"" in imposing sanctions on Russia indicated one simple conclusion: ""It is not about Ukraine, it is about the future of the world order. ""They say everybody must support a rules-based world order, and the rules are written depending on what specific situation the West wants to resolve in its own favour."" Earlier, Mr Lavrov held talks with his Egyptian counterpart, Sameh Shoukry. Egypt has significant ties with Russia, which supplies wheat, weapons and - until the invasion of Ukraine began - large numbers of tourists. After his talks with Mr Shoukry, Mr Lavrov told a joint news conference that the West was prolonging the conflict even though it understood ""what and whose end it will be"". It is the first stage for Mr Lavrov of a brief tour of Africa taking in Ethiopia, Uganda and Congo-Brazzaville. In an article published by local newspapers in the run-up to his tour, Mr Lavrov said his country had always ""sincerely supported Africans in their struggle for freedom from the colonial yoke"". He added that Russia appreciated Africans' ""balanced position"" on the issue of Ukraine. How much grain is stuck in Ukraine? Ukraine and Russia usually supply more than 40% of Africa's wheat, the African Development Bank says. Egypt is normally a big consumer of Ukrainian wheat. In 2019, it imported 3.62 million tonnes of it, more than any country. But in his article, Mr Lavrov rejected the accusation that Russia was ""exporting famine"" and blamed it on Western propaganda. He added that Western sanctions imposed on Russia had exacerbated ""negative tendencies"" in the international food market that stemmed from the coronavirus pandemic. By Will Ross, Africa regional editor, BBC World Service Sergei Lavrov is trying to convince African countries that they are better off siding with Russia than the West - using phrases like ""we'll help you complete the process of decolonisation"". But it is clear across much of the continent that there is a reluctance to take sides over the war in Ukraine.  The Cold War had a devastating impact, fuelling conflicts in Africa and halting development. Right now, of greatest concern is the spiralling cost of food and fuel.  More than 40% of Africa's wheat comes from Russia and Ukraine. Some African leaders will be aware that when people cannot afford to eat, their own positions in power are less secure.

"MPs have said there is ""no clear evidence"" the Rwanda scheme will stop risky Channel crossings Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak have vowed to toughen controls on migration into the UK as part of their bids to become next Tory leader and prime minister. Mr Sunak said he would tighten the definition of who qualifies for asylum and introduce a cap on refugee numbers. Ms Truss said she would extend the UK's Rwanda asylum plan and increase the number of Border Force staff. More than 14,000 migrants have crossed the Channel to the UK on small boats so far this year. In an attempt to deter the crossings, in April the government announced it would send some asylum seekers deemed to have entered the UK illegally to Rwanda to claim refuge there. However, no asylum seekers have been sent to the east-African country yet following a series of legal challenges. The UK stands to lose the Â£120m it has paid to Rwanda if the plan is ruled unlawful by the courts at an upcoming hearing. Both leadership hopefuls said they would explore similar deals with other countries. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss told the Mail on Sunday the Rwanda policy was the right approach and that she was determined to""see it through to full implementation"",external. Ms Truss also said that if she became Tory Party leader and prime minister, she would increase Border Force staffing from 9,000 to 10,800. She has also promised a strengthened UK bill of rights, adding: ""I'm determined to end the appalling people trafficking we're seeing."" Why do migrants leave France for the UK? Why are asylum seekers being sent to Rwanda? How many people cross the Channel? Former chancellor Mr Sunak has also pledged to do ""whatever it takes"" to make the Rwanda scheme work and described the UK's migration policy as ""broken"" and ""chaotic"". His plans would see the UK re-assessing aid, trade terms and visa options on the basis of a country's willingness to co-operate with the return of failed asylum seekers and offenders. He has also promised to give Parliament control over how many come to the UK by creating an annual cap on the number of refugees accepted each year, though this could be changed in the case of emergencies. And he said he would introduce ""enhanced powers"" to detain, tag and monitor those entering the UK illegally. He said: ""Right now the system is chaotic, with law-abiding citizens seeing boats full of illegal immigrants coming from the safe country of France with our sailors and coastguards seemingly powerless to stop them."" Migration and tax plans are the latest issues to emerge in the Tory Party leadership contest But shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper criticised the pair's proposals, saying they were wasting taxpayers' money on the Rwanda scheme. She said: ""The Conservatives have been in power for 12 years. It beggars belief that they claim to be the ones to sort things out when they have both failed for so long."" Last month, 47 people were told they would be flown to Rwanda, with a flight booked for 14 June. But after a series of legal challenges the flight was cancelled. Another flight has not yet been scheduled. Earlier this week, a Commons select committee cast doubt on the effectiveness of the scheme, saying there was""no clear evidence""it would stop risky Channel crossings. On Saturday, the two candidates clashed over their tax plans. Ms Truss rejected Mr Sunak's criticism that it would be wrong to raise government borrowing to fund tax cuts - a major policy difference between the candidates. She is pledging around Â£30bn in immediate tax cuts, arguing they will boost growth, while Mr Sunak has said immediate cuts could fuel already-soaring inflation. Conservative Party members are due to start receiving ballot papers this week and the winner will be announced on 5 September. Mr Sunak, who quit as part of the government mutiny against Boris Johnson, topped the MPs' ballots to qualify for the final run-off with Ms Truss. But polls currently suggest the foreign secretary is the favoured candidate of party members, who decide the leader. It is thought a significant chunk of the 160,000 or so Tory members will vote in the coming weeks. Hustings will take place throughout July and August, and the two candidates will square off in a live BBC TV debate on Monday, followed by another hosted by The Sun and TalkTV on Tuesday.

Many treatments are available for breast cancer and survival is generally good if the disease is detected early. Follow BBC London onFacebook,external,Twitter,externalandInstagram,external.

"This video can not be played Gauging the summer cost of living With holiday season in full swing, BBC Scotland's consumer affairs correspondent Connor Gillies has taken a trip of his own. He wanted to find out how people across the country are coping with the rising price of energy, food and fuel. In four locations over four days, the phrase ""cost of living"" was greeted with a dreadfully familiar sigh from everyone we met. From Millport on the Isle of Cumbrae, to the Kelpies in Falkirk, Pitlochry and Fort William, our journey showed that every community in Scotland has a unique experience of this crisis. Gordon and Seonaide Barclay from Saltcoats, were on holiday in Pitlochry I met Ayrshire couple Gordon and Seonaid Barclay at a caravan park in Pitlochry. They described the current price rises and the impact it is having on their lives as ""horrible"". Seonaid said: ""I shop around now and look for cheaper prices in different shops. Before I would do all my shopping in Asda, now I go around all different shops looking for cheaper prices. ""You go in and it used to be a dozen eggs for Â£1, now it's Â£1.25/ Â£1.30. I used to get my wee boy a tub of fruit that used to be a pound, now it's Â£1.50. That's a big jump."" Dad Gordon told me he uses price comparison websites for almost everything in life these days. It is all about saving every penny and pound possible. The NHS worker said: ""We are actually in a worse state now than we were after World War Two. ""Today's standards of living are going through the floor. You have today's society going to food banks which is disgusting."" There is no petrol station on the Clyde coast island of Cumbrae. It has a population of just over 1,000 people, but it is extremely popular with day trippers. We heard the tale of the local electrician who has ditched his van because he can't afford to top up the fuel anymore. A story echoed by the island's delivery driver who cut back his trips on the ferry to the mainland because the cost was mounting up. Locals don't get a discount on the eight minute Calmac crossing - meaning it's at least Â£15 to take the car on and off. Scott Ferris owns a bike shop in Millport Scott Ferris runs one of the local bike shops in Millport. He is doing a roaring trade as visitors come to the island especially to do the 10 mile circular loop. A once affordable day trip is creeping up in cost. The price of hiring a bike is up as much as 15% as firms try to grapple with price rises. Scott told us: ""On a very sunny day we can do up to 300 bikes a day, up to 5,000 people will travel to the island on a good day. ""Prices have had to go up again from parts, staff, fuel, all those costs have raised in the last couple of years and any away-days for families becoming more and more expensive will make it a difficult choice for them to have to make - stay at home or go away spend money they potentially don't  have."" Gordon Allan of Falkirk butcher firm Malcolm Allan Tucked away in an industrial estate in Larbert near Falkirk is the factory for Malcolm Allan butchers. They are well known for their blue-boxed steak pies and Scottish cooked breakfast packs, which are found on the shelves of all major supermarkets. I met boss Gordon Allan who gives a stark reminder that businesses aren't protected with an energy price cap like consumers. He told me: ""We were Â£6,500 a week for electricity, now we've gone to Â£13,500 and this week with the hot weather we are Â£15,000 for the week. It's bonkers. Everybody seems to be just burying their heads in the sand and thinking it will go away. It's not going away. ""We've changed all our working patterns, we work one factory two days a week, we work our bakery four days a week. We used to be seven days a week production."" Gordon's story of survival chimes with the reality facing many firms just now. A precarious financial situation means sacrifices along the way. He continued: ""We've looked at every aspect of our business from packaging - we'll stop putting all our steak pies in cardboard boxes from 1 August that will save some money. ""But why should we have to? I like my products in cardboard boxes, the customers like our products in cardboard boxes"" Frazer Scott from Energy Action Scotland speaks to Connor at The Kelpies Along the road in the shadow of the Forth Valley's mighty Grangemouth oil refinery are the Kelpies and the Helix park. A place where families can enjoy a free day out at a time when budgets are restricted. We set up our BBC Scotland News red deck chairs and encouraged people to pose their questions to expert Frazer Scott from the charity Energy Action Scotland. The overriding thought was one of why are gas and electricity bills increasing so much? Others wanted Frazer to provide the best tips on cutting their energy usage to save where they could. Alan Chilton donated a fajita kit and took some eggs from a community larder in Pitlochry Outside the entrance to the Atholl Centre in Pitlochry is a shed with no door. It is known as the ""community larder"" where people can drop in 24 hours a day, seven days a week for free food. There are shelves stacked with rolls, cakes, fruit and veg all coming towards their use-by dates. The local supermarket supplies the goods in the hope of cutting down on waste. A quirky concept saving people, like Allan Chilton, money. The 30-year-old, who relied heavily on this larder during lockdown when he lost his job, turned up with a fajita kit in his hands ready to donate for someone else to feel the benefit of. He then picked up some eggs before heading up to the village to do his shopping. It saves him buying them. The cost of living means people are trying to see how they can stretch out their money. Tourism is the lifeblood of the local economy in Fort William and across Lochaber. Jobs and livelihoods rely on it. Locals told me they really struggled during the height of the pandemic when overseas visitors were banned from coming here. It's a very different story now. The high street was an eclectic mix of foreign accents and the roads full of European number plates. Business is back. Sophie and Alicia Zieman, from Kentucky, were on holiday in Fort William We went to the platform where the Jacobite Steam train was waiting to depart. A magnet for tourists who recognise the burgundy carriages and black-polished engine from the famous Harry Potter films. I met Alicia Zieman and her daughter Sophie who had arrived this week from the US state of Kentucky. She said ""We will go out to eat in the restaurants here but not as much as we used to before. ""We are staying in a hotel here and the price has gone up. We were just talking about that with our cab driver on the way here"" Mathieu, Etienne and Alban are making packed lunches rather than eating out at cafes We also stumbled across French dad Mathieu Percot and his young sons Etienne and Alban, who were kitted out in their Hogwarts robes. They told me how they now make packed lunches to save money rather than stopping in the local cafes. They visit budget supermarkets in Fort William in the morning for supplies whereas before they would have stopped for food in local places. The Scottish Tourism Alliance recently reported half of its members suggesting consumer spending is down 50% on pre-pandemic levels. An indication of changing habits on this financial journey which is no where near the end. How are you dealing with the rising cost of living?

"Lupita Nyong'o, Letitia Wright, Danai Gurira, Florence Kasumba and Winston Duke were all present at the event Marvel Studios has unveiled the trailer for November's Black Panther: Wakanda Forever to eager fans, who roared their approval in a boisterous session at Comic-Con in San Diego. The film is the sequel to 2018's Black Panther, which starred the late Chadwick Boseman as T'Challa, the heroic crime-fighting king of Wakanda, a fictional African country with incredibly advanced technology. The trailer opens with a female vocalist singing No Woman, No Cry, but there were some tears on stage as Boseman's castmates spoke of how much it meant to them to honour his memory through this new project. Ryan Coogler, returning as director, spoke about how excited the T'Challa actor had been to see the first Black Panther footage five years ago at Comic-Con. ""I can feel his hand on me now,"" he said. Ryan Coogler is returning to direct Wakanda Forever, which appears to involve a conflict with Atlantis Also reprising their roles are British star Letitia Wright, who plays Shuri - the Black Panther's sister - and Oscar-winner Lupita Nyong'o as Nakia, an undercover spy in service to Wakanda. Before the cast took the stage, a group of musicians and dancers playing African drums and vocalising gave a spine-tingling performance that had the crowd on their feet. Wakanda Forever will introduce Tenoch Huerta (Narcos: Mexico), as anti-hero Namor McKenzie, known as the Sub-Mariner - confirming a long-standing casting rumour. Namor, who rules the watery kingdom of Atlantis, is the film's antagonist - with the trailer hinting at a conflict between Wakanda and his people. Allow YouTube content?

Addressing the fans, Huerta shared an emotional perspective on the power of inclusion, saying: ""I come from the hood, seriously. And thanks to inclusion, I'm here. A lot of kids are there in their hood, looking at us, dreaming of being here. And they are going to make it!"" He went on to add his thanks in Spanish. Other new additions to the cast include Michaela Coel (I May Destroy You), and Dominique Thorne as Riri Williams / Ironheart - a teenaged inventor who becomes a superhero (and will get her own show on Disney+ in 2023.) The first Black Panther film took over a billion dollars at the box office, becoming the first superhero film nominated for the best picture Oscar - and a cultural milestone for diversity in filmmaking. Marvel previously confirmed it would not be re-casting the role of T'Challa, a decision that has divided fans - some feeling it should forever belong to Boseman, who died of colon cancer in 2020, and some voices - including Boseman's brother - saying it should pass to a new actor. Michaela Coel, Dominique Thorne and Tenoch Huerta are new joiners for the Black Panther sequel There has been speculation that the panther suit could now go to Shuri, and while that wasn't confirmed - the very final frame of the trailer features a telltale flash of the Black Panther claws. For readers unfamiliar with the Marvel Universe - it's a sprawling place filled with dozens of overlapping characters, which its creators try to make more manageable by grouping projects into ""phases"". The current tranche of films and TV shows is known as Phase 4 - and Marvel Studios head Kevin Feige confirmed it will end with Wakanda Forever on 11 November. But teasing fans with a peek at the future, he also lifted the curtain on Phase 5, confirming that Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania - which stars Paul Rudd as Scott Lang / Ant-Man - will launch the new film cycle on 17 February. Paul Rudd, who plays Ant-Man, looked happy to take the stage - though he was tight-lipped on his film's contents Joining Feige on stage with the rest of the cast, Rudd was asked what his character has been up to lately. ""Scott is pretty pleased with himself for his role in saving the universe,"" he confirmed, a reference to previous Avengers films that got a big laugh. Next in line will be Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3, the final instalment of the space saga, set for release on 5 May. Director James Gunn got teary as he recalled pitching the franchise a decade ago this week in North Carolina, where Iron Man 3 was being filmed. ""They've saved the universe a few times, but really what they do is save each other,"" he said. ""This is the end of that story. I'm saying some stories have an end. It doesn't mean everybody dies!"" Guardians of the Galaxy director James Gunn with actor Chris Pratt, who plays Star-Lord Gunn was joined on the famous Hall H stage by the film's cast, and Chris Pratt (who plays Star-Lord) confirmed it was the first time the cast had seen the trailer - ""it's beautiful!"" The gallop through Phase 5 continues with The Marvels - in which Captain Marvel joins forces with Ms Marvel and Spectrum, aka Monica Rambeau. And it will conclude in July 2024 with Thunderbolts - but there was no team reveal today, so fans will have to wait a little longer to learn who's in it. Feige then skipped further forward to Phase 6 - confirming that the cycle will feature The Fantastic Four, release date 8 November, 2024 - but again, no casting just yet. Phase 6 will end towards the close of 2025 with two films: Avengers: The Kang Dynasty, and Avengers: Secret Wars. The Marvel Studios boss shared his timeline of upcoming releases with fans all the way to 2025 While Marvel doesn't reveal in advance what it will discuss at San Diego Comic-Con - a major pop culture event where some of the most successful films on record have debuted - its announcements are Saturday's hottest ticket. So far, 2022 has already seen the release of Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, starring Benedict Cumberbatch as the doctor-cum-master of the mystical arts, and Thor: Love and Thunder, as well as TV series like Moon Knight and Miss Marvel. TV series She-Hulk: Attorney at Law, is smashing its way to Disney+ in August, and got its moment in the spotlight with a cast appearance. The final trailer sees the character adjusting to life as a superhero - helped by her cousin, The Hulk / Bruce Banner, whose assistance appears to include rock throwing and occasional yoga.

TV series She-Hulk: Attorney at Law, is smashing its way to Disney+ in August, and got its moment in the spotlight with a cast appearance.

"Mr Lavrov spoke with the head of the Arab League Russia's Foreign Minister, Sergei Lavrov, on a diplomatic offensive in Egypt, has dismissed claims that Moscow caused the global food crisis. In a speech to Arab League ambassadors in Cairo, he said Western nations were distorting the truth about the impact of sanctions on global food security. He accused Western nations of trying to impose their dominance over others. Much of the Arab world and Africa is badly affected by grain shortages caused by Russia's war in Ukraine. A landmark deal signed on Friday to resume Ukraine's grain exports hangs in the balanceafter Russia attacked targets in the port of Odesa on Saturday. Mr Lavrov will go on to visit three African nations to rally support amid anger over the war. Life on the front-line of severe food shortages Mr Lavrov said that Western nations' ""aggressiveness"" in imposing sanctions on Russia indicated one simple conclusion: ""It is not about Ukraine, it is about the future of the world order. ""They say everybody must support a rules-based world order, and the rules are written depending on what specific situation the West wants to resolve in its own favour."" Earlier, Mr Lavrov held talks with his Egyptian counterpart, Sameh Shoukry. Egypt has significant ties with Russia, which supplies wheat, weapons and - until the invasion of Ukraine began - large numbers of tourists. After his talks with Mr Shoukry, Mr Lavrov told a joint news conference that the West was prolonging the conflict even though it understood ""what and whose end it will be"". It is the first stage for Mr Lavrov of a brief tour of Africa taking in Ethiopia, Uganda and Congo-Brazzaville. In an article published by local newspapers in the run-up to his tour, Mr Lavrov said his country had always ""sincerely supported Africans in their struggle for freedom from the colonial yoke"". He added that Russia appreciated Africans' ""balanced position"" on the issue of Ukraine. How much grain is stuck in Ukraine? Ukraine and Russia usually supply more than 40% of Africa's wheat, the African Development Bank says. Egypt is normally a big consumer of Ukrainian wheat. In 2019, it imported 3.62 million tonnes of it, more than any country. But in his article, Mr Lavrov rejected the accusation that Russia was ""exporting famine"" and blamed it on Western propaganda. He added that Western sanctions imposed on Russia had exacerbated ""negative tendencies"" in the international food market that stemmed from the coronavirus pandemic. By Will Ross, Africa regional editor, BBC World Service Sergei Lavrov is trying to convince African countries that they are better off siding with Russia than the West - using phrases like ""we'll help you complete the process of decolonisation"". But it is clear across much of the continent that there is a reluctance to take sides over the war in Ukraine.  The Cold War had a devastating impact, fuelling conflicts in Africa and halting development. Right now, of greatest concern is the spiralling cost of food and fuel.  More than 40% of Africa's wheat comes from Russia and Ukraine. Some African leaders will be aware that when people cannot afford to eat, their own positions in power are less secure.

"MPs have said there is ""no clear evidence"" the Rwanda scheme will stop risky Channel crossings Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak have vowed to toughen controls on migration into the UK as part of their bids to become next Tory leader and prime minister. Mr Sunak said he would tighten the definition of who qualifies for asylum and introduce a cap on refugee numbers. Ms Truss said she would extend the UK's Rwanda asylum plan and increase the number of Border Force staff. More than 14,000 migrants have crossed the Channel to the UK on small boats so far this year. In an attempt to deter the crossings, in April the government announced it would send some asylum seekers deemed to have entered the UK illegally to Rwanda to claim refuge there. However, no asylum seekers have been sent to the east-African country yet following a series of legal challenges. The UK stands to lose the Â£120m it has paid to Rwanda if the plan is ruled unlawful by the courts at an upcoming hearing. Both leadership hopefuls said they would explore similar deals with other countries. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss told the Mail on Sunday the Rwanda policy was the right approach and that she was determined to""see it through to full implementation"",external. Ms Truss also said that if she became Tory Party leader and prime minister, she would increase Border Force staffing from 9,000 to 10,800. She has also promised a strengthened UK bill of rights, adding: ""I'm determined to end the appalling people trafficking we're seeing."" Why do migrants leave France for the UK? Why are asylum seekers being sent to Rwanda? How many people cross the Channel? Former chancellor Mr Sunak has also pledged to do ""whatever it takes"" to make the Rwanda scheme work and described the UK's migration policy as ""broken"" and ""chaotic"". His plans would see the UK re-assessing aid, trade terms and visa options on the basis of a country's willingness to co-operate with the return of failed asylum seekers and offenders. He has also promised to give Parliament control over how many come to the UK by creating an annual cap on the number of refugees accepted each year, though this could be changed in the case of emergencies. And he said he would introduce ""enhanced powers"" to detain, tag and monitor those entering the UK illegally. He said: ""Right now the system is chaotic, with law-abiding citizens seeing boats full of illegal immigrants coming from the safe country of France with our sailors and coastguards seemingly powerless to stop them."" Migration and tax plans are the latest issues to emerge in the Tory Party leadership contest But shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper criticised the pair's proposals, saying they were wasting taxpayers' money on the Rwanda scheme. She said: ""The Conservatives have been in power for 12 years. It beggars belief that they claim to be the ones to sort things out when they have both failed for so long."" Last month, 47 people were told they would be flown to Rwanda, with a flight booked for 14 June. But after a series of legal challenges the flight was cancelled. Another flight has not yet been scheduled. Earlier this week, a Commons select committee cast doubt on the effectiveness of the scheme, saying there was""no clear evidence""it would stop risky Channel crossings. On Saturday, the two candidates clashed over their tax plans. Ms Truss rejected Mr Sunak's criticism that it would be wrong to raise government borrowing to fund tax cuts - a major policy difference between the candidates. She is pledging around Â£30bn in immediate tax cuts, arguing they will boost growth, while Mr Sunak has said immediate cuts could fuel already-soaring inflation. Conservative Party members are due to start receiving ballot papers this week and the winner will be announced on 5 September. Mr Sunak, who quit as part of the government mutiny against Boris Johnson, topped the MPs' ballots to qualify for the final run-off with Ms Truss. But polls currently suggest the foreign secretary is the favoured candidate of party members, who decide the leader. It is thought a significant chunk of the 160,000 or so Tory members will vote in the coming weeks. Hustings will take place throughout July and August, and the two candidates will square off in a live BBC TV debate on Monday, followed by another hosted by The Sun and TalkTV on Tuesday.

"This video can not be played Aerial video shows scale of queues leading up to Dover The Port of Dover has declared a ""critical incident"" due to six-hour queues leading to the ferry terminal. Chief executive Doug Bannister said the port had been ""badly let down"" by French border controls. French authorities said an ""unforeseeable technical incident"" in the Channel Tunnel meant French border police were delayed into Dover. However Eurotunnel rejected this, saying it was ""categorically not the reason for the difficulties"". A spokesman added: ""The critical incident in Dover started overnight.  The minor technical incident at the Channel Tunnel occurred at 07:00 BST, well after the critical incident."" French border resources have now increased, the port said, and ""traffic is slowly beginning to move"". Dover's MP Natalie Elphicke claimed French border officers ""didn't turn up for work"", causing traffic to queue for miles. Holidaymakers are being delayed at French border checks in Dover However in a statement this afternoon, the prefect for the Haut-de-France region,Â Georges-Francois Leclerc, said it was not correct to say that the French had failed to mobilise sufficient border police for the predicted rush. ""The increase in traffic for this weekend was fully anticipated and a suitable deployment was prepared,"" the statement said. ""The plan was to have all the police booths manned at Dover by 08:30 BST. ""An unforeseeable technical incident in the tunnel meant that police had to push back their full deployment by an hour."" The port has warned that it would ""take some time to clear the backlog."" Live updates: Travellers warned of six-hour delays at Dover A UK government spokesperson said they were ""working closely with French authorities, the Port of Dover, Kent Resilience Forum and police to ease disruptionÂ and provide on the ground support"". People are being advised to bring provisions as they face a six-hour delay The leader of Dover District Council, Trevor Bartlett, said: ""Alongside the delays for tens of thousands of tourists, the local community is the biggest loser."" He added: ""Serious questions need to be asked about how the emergency services would be able to respond to a major incident in Dover when it is completely gridlocked, and how this situation has been allowed to develop yet again?"" This video can not be played Watch: 'We arrived in Dover at 7.30 and been in traffic since' Eurotunnel is not affected, but it will not have capacity to take any passengers from Dover. With most schools in England and Wales breaking up for summer this week, the RAC said an estimated 18.8 million leisure trips were planned in the UK between Friday and Monday. That is the most since the company began tracking summer getaway numbers in 2014. Francesco Caputo and his three children, aged 12, 11 and 7, were travelling from Southampton to Italy, via Dover, to see family. Speaking this morning he said: ""Everything has gone pear shaped."" The family left Southampton with the advice to arrive two hours before the ferry. ""The ferry we were meant to catch was 07:50 BST. We arrived two hours before, 1.7 miles from the ferry terminal, but we're not even there now. ""I've tried to keep the children busy, so far so good. They've been rather patient."" One traveller posted on Twitter: ""I'm booked onto 8am ferry from Dover and it's total gridlock. Moved 50 metres per hour. At this rate it'll be 34 hours before I get to the port."" Another person attempting to make the Channel crossing said they had been ""waiting five hours and still not in the port"". Ferry operator P&O Ferries has advised passengers to arrive prepared with snacks and water, adding: ""Please be aware that there is heavy traffic at border control in the port of Dover. ""If you are booked to travel today please allow at least six hours to clear all security checks."" The Port of Dover says it is working with the government over the ""logjam"" The UK government blamed French authorities for the delays at Dover, with Europe minister Graham Stewart saying some disruption was inevitable, but the issue laid with French authorities. Ms Elphicke added there had been ""weeks of preparation"" for an anticipated busy week, by the port, the Department for Transport and Kent Resilience Forum, and ""much work with French counterparts too"". She said: ""Despite all this, French border officers didn't turn up for work at the passport controls as needed."" In a statement the Port of Dover said: ""The port is working to do all it can with ferry operators and local partners to assist with clearing the queues caused by inadequate French border capacity. ""We urge French colleagues to adequately resource the border, not just to relieve the current situation, but for the rest of the weekend and indeed the rest of the summer to keep our community clear, to get families on their holidays and to keep essential trade moving."" The port also called on the UK government to continue working with France to make sure this happened. Has your journey been affected by the delays in Dover?

"Travellers heading to France are facing delays of several hours amid continuing gridlock on roads near Dover and the Eurotunnel terminal in Folkestone. More than 17,000 passengers had left Dover on ferries by lunchtime on one of the busiest weekends of the year. P&O Ferries warned customers to allow three to four hours to clear local roads and security checks on Saturday. Passengers using Eurotunnel also faced lengthy delays on the journey to the Folkestone terminal. Are UK travellers heading for a summer of misery? This weekend is one of the busiest for UK overseas travel as most schools in England and Wales have broken up for the summer. Families travelling to the Eurotunnel terminal told the BBC they faced delays of more than six hours amid heavy congestion around Folkestone. Passengers using Eurotunnel were asked to arrive two hours early by the operator. John Keefe, director of public affairs for Eurotunnel, said traffic disruption had been caused by an accident on the M20 on Friday, and stretches of the road being used solely for freight traffic, with holidaymakers diverted on to A-roads. Saturday's delays follow long waits on Friday when a major incident was declared after routes around the Kent terminals were in gridlock and traffic queues four miles long also formed on the eastbound M2. This video can not be played Thousands of lorries stacked on M20 outside Dover A war of words broke out between UK and French officials over the cause of the disruption. In a visit to Kent on Saturday afternoon, Tory leadership candidate and Foreign Secretary Liz Truss claimed delays at Dover ferry port were down to a lack of French border staff. She said: ""I'm very clear that we need to see action from them to resolve the terrible situation that people are facing."" But Calais MP Pierre-Henri Dumont rejected this and said additional checks post-Brexit and a lack of capacity at the port were behind the problem. He also told BBC News the Port of Dover was ""too small"" and there were too few kiosks due to lack of space. Some 3,000 lorries are also waiting to cross the Channel. They are currently parked on the M20 outside Dover, while holiday traffic is prioritised. Natalie Chapman, from haulier group Logistics UK, said some lorry drivers had waited to cross the Channel for ""well over 18 hours"" in queues with no toilet facilities. Jane Dennis and her family managed to escape the gridlock after six hours by taking a detour Jane Dennis, her husband and their five children, aged between three and 11, barely moved for six hours while trying to reach the Eurotunnel terminal. Between around 7am and 1pm they advanced approximately 70 metres before deciding to take a detour that friends had used. ""We hit the queue at about 07:05 BST, and we left the queue six hours later at about 13:10 BST, when we'd travelled 70 metres or so,"" she told the BBC. ""Literally inching a couple of cars' worth forward every hour."" She said the traffic queues weren't being managed by anyone, adding: ""It was just the way the gridlock happened, the one we were in initially there was nowhere for people to budge."" Once they made the detour, traffic was flowing freely on other roads. They eventually arrived in France 12 hours after setting off from home in Hampshire, and had to try to find a hotel to stay in overnight, before continuing their journey to a campsite in Vendee on Sunday. Anna Parkinson faced long delays while travelling with her three children. Holidaymaker Anna Parkinson took seven hours to travel two miles to the Eurotunnel terminal - with three ""fractious"" children sat in the back. She said she felt for local residents who ""currently can't leave their local villages because they're hemmed in by all of us desperately trying to get on the train that we should have caught five hours ago"". Tim Povall, travelling to Budapest with his wife, two sons and their dog, had been queuing for nearly seven hours when he spoke to the BBC, meaning their planned stopover in Bruges was disrupted. He says there should have been better organisation at Folkestone to avoid a ""free-for-all"". ""It's ruined this evening. My two sons are angry and my dog isn't happy. It just doesn't make sense. ""There are lots of pregnant people and people with kids walking around. It's hot, I feel sorry for them."" By Dan Johnson, BBC News We're told that things are flowing a bit more freely and that they are starting to eat into that backlog that built up yesterday. There are a lot of cars queuing here at the port at the moment. But in a sense this is the good queue. This is the queue you want to be part of. The problem is that thousands of people are stuck on the roads miles out from Dover trying to get across Kent to the port. They've been held back by the police operations that have been in place to try to manage the traffic, to try to stop Dover itself getting completely snarled up. And that does seem to have been a bit more successful today, but drivers are still being warned that they do face big delays. Has your journey been affected by the delays in Dover?

"For travellers, the past fortnight has brought a tidal wave of bad news. Cancelled flights, proposed rail strikes and record-breaking petrol prices have thrown people's plans into disarray - and now the peak summer holiday season and the long school break are hovering on the horizon. After more than two years of Covid restrictions, this should be a summer of fun. But are we now heading into a summer of misery? We take a look at where things stand for planes and trains over the weeks ahead. The UK air travel industry has just faced what is arguably its biggest test since coronavirus rules were lifted and it is fair to say, it has been a bumpy ride. Over the Jubilee bank holiday, which coincided with many schools' half-term breaks, 750 flights out of the UK were cancelled, according to aviation data firm Cirium. Around 466 return flights were axed. Although cancellations made up a small percentage of total flights, many passengers were only informed at short notice and faced long queues to check-in bags and get through security. Staff shortages from job cuts made at the height of the pandemic have been driving cancellations and delays, heightening holidaymakers' anxiety that problems will continue into the key summer season. Why are so many flights being cancelled? What are my rights if my flight is cancelled? Add to that the threat of strike action. British Airways workers have voted in favour of supporting industrial action, in a ballot conducted by the Unite union, while Ryanair is facing walkouts by staff in parts of Europe. Jess Baker has been put off travelling abroad this summer after a recent ""nightmare"" 18-hour journey home from Iceland. She, her husband Shaun and their two children had their EasyJet flight into Luton cancelled on Monday. They were given the option to travel home on Thursday but needed to get back sooner so paid Â£1,000 to fly into Glasgow with Icelandair. They shelled out an additional Â£340 to hire a car to drive down to Luton to collect their own vehicle. Jess Baker and her family had their EasyJet flight cancelled from Iceland to Luton ""It's been an absolute nightmare,"" says Ms Baker. ""We quickly decided that we'll go camping here instead. It's not worth the hassle all over again."" Others may have the same idea. Sykes Holiday Cottages says it has seen a 22% rise in bookings in the past two weeks compared to the same period last year. Chief executive Graham Donoghue says it is ""at least in part due to widespread reports of overseas travel disruption"". ""Travellers simply don't want to have to tackle airports and take the risk that their family holidays could be cancelled,"" he says. Since cutting staff, airlines, airports and the companies that provide baggage handling have been recruiting but because new workers have to pass security checks, it takes time. Heathrow airport's boss John Holland-Kayerecently told the Financial Times,externalit could take up to 18 months for the aviation sector to ""fully recover capacity"". Aviation consultant Chris Tarry tells the BBC the situation should improve as more staff are security cleared, but he warns there are ""unlikely to be enough workers in certain areas given wages and working conditions"". And airports ""only work if all of the elements are in place"", he says. Glastonbury Festival returns this year on 22 June, but it might not be that easy to get there now rail strikes have been announced. More than 40,000 RMT Union members from Network Rail and 13 train operators are set to walk out after talks over pay and redundancies broke down. The strikes are due to take place on 21, 23 and 25 June but it is likely services across the whole week will be disrupted. Train drivers are also going to hold their own strikes over pay. Passengers have been advised not to travel on trainsunless necessary during the strikes. Zahid Fayyaz, a solicitor from Brixton who is planning to travel to Glastonbury by train, is worried about the impact the potential strikes might have. Zahid Fayyaz is having to change his travel plans to get to Glastonbury Festival He originally had a ticket for 23 June but because of the planned strike on that day he and his two friends have bought new tickets to travel the day before. It cost them Â£240 and an extra day off work. ""It's going to take an extra two hours, but aside from this I'll be fine. But other people won't be able to take time off work or afford the extra money,"" the 40-year-old says. Railway workers to strike over three days in June When is the rail strike and which lines will be affected? Unions branded selfish by No 10 over rail strikes Mr Fayyaz says he is broadly sympathetic to the rail workers striking, but believes the ""timing is wrong"". Glastonbury Festival is one of several events impacted by potential travel disruption, along with a cricket test match between England and New Zealand in Leeds.  Glastonbury22-26 Third TestHeadingley 23-27 Ed SheeranWembley 25 Some people are switching their mode of transport to buses and coaches. Chris Hardy, managing director of National Express, said the firm had seen an increase in enquiries and bookings during the days of the rail strikes. The walkout could yet be called off if all parties can reach an agreement. That's what John Kuehne, from Fort Lauderdale in Florida, is hoping for. John Kuehne, a Yes fan from Florida, faces rail disruption during his trip to the UK He's traveling to England along with many of his friends from around the world to see prog-rock legends Yes, who are performing at London's Royal Albert Hall on 21 June. But ""everything is up in the air"" now, he says. ""Car rentals, parking, fuel, tolls, and congestion zone fees make it very expensive and inconvenient."" Mr Kuehne also happens to be arriving in the UK just as the cost of filling an average family car hit Â£100 for the first time. He says labour disputes happen but that ""all sides need to come together quickly to find a reasonable solution"".

"Xi Jinping has been vaccinated against Covid, officials said President Xi Jinping and other top politicians have been given domestically produced Covid vaccines, China has said. The news was released as part of a campaign to increase vaccination rates, especially of boosters. The deputy head of China's National Health Commission, Zeng Yixin, said it showed the leadership's confidence in the Chinese vaccines. Health information about these figures is not usually shared with the public. Mr Zeng said the country's leaders had ""all taken the home-grown Covid-19 vaccination jabs"". He added: ""This has fully displayed that they attach great importance to the epidemic prevention and control work and highly trust the home-grown Covid-19 vaccines."" Officials are trying to increase vaccination rates, which are considered too low for the country to reopen safely. China continues to follow a""zero Covid""strategy, including mass testing, strict isolation rules and local lockdowns. While there have been far fewer deaths than in many other countries, this approach is facing growing opposition as people and businesses continue to face thestrain of restrictions. President Xi has repeatedly said that there is no alternative to zero Covid. China has seen 2,167,619 cases and 14,647 deaths since the pandemic began, according toJohns Hopkins University,external. This compares with 23,088,074 cases and 181,398 deaths in the UK. An outbreak of Covid inShanghaiin April saw the city placed into lockdown for more than two months. During the outbreak, concerns were raised over low vaccination rates. Officials said just 38% of those over 60 had received a booster, while only 15% of over-80s had been given two doses. Recent figures show that across the country, 90% of people have now had two jabs.

"Hazel with her son Theo Parents could take up to an extra 12 weeks of paid leave if their child is born prematurely, as part of a new law. Both parents would qualify for one week's extra help - in addition to existing maternity and paternity leave and pay entitlements - for every seven days their baby was in neonatal care. One in seven UK newborns,externalneeds to be placed in a specialist hospital unit. The Neonatal Care (Leave and Pay) Bill completed its second reading in Parliament last week. Proposed by SNP MP Stuart McDonald, it still needs to go through a number of stages of parliamentary scrutiny before becoming law but has received cross-party support in the House of Commons. Itwould also provide support,externalfor babies born at full term who need neonatal care, so long as they are no older than 28 days when admitted to a unit. When Hazel Naghi gave birth to her son Theo at 32 weeks, last year, she had to split her time at hospital with her partner, Oliver, a night-shift worker. ""Because of his prematurity, we had to be transferred to another hospital an hour away [when he was born] and he spent five days in that hospital in an incubator,"" she tells BBC News. ""He was then transferred back to the local hospital and spent a further four weeks in there until we could bring him home Even then, Theo needed a feeding tube for an additional month. Hazel ""wouldn't have been mentally prepared"" to return to work nine months after Theo's due date and says the extra time off proposed in this bill would have really helped, making her feel ""she wasn't alone"". ""It means a lot that the government understands this happens on a regular basis,"" Hazel says, ""and this law would take weight off the minds of parents and give them a sense of relief. ""Having a baby prematurely is a very different experience to having a child full term. ""I don't think many people realise how common it is to have a premature baby, so knowing that there could be support from the government and that your employer would mean you wouldn't have to panic."" Theo was born at 32 weeks More than 100,000 babies were admitted to neonatal care in the UK in 2016,research from Imperial College London,externalshows. And Mr McDonald told MPs his proposal would ""give parents the emotional and financial support needed at a time of great stress and trauma"". Others shared their experiences, including fellow SNP MP David Linden, who said he would remember until his ""dying day"" watching his daughter turn blue in an incubator as neonatal nurses rushed to resuscitate her. A baby is considered to be premature if it is born before the 37th week of pregnancy. It is possible for a baby to survive when born at about 24 weeks of pregnancy - but the earlier it is, the more complications there could be. With incubators to keep babies warm, neonatal units are also used for newborns with complications such as low weight, infections and jaundice and recovery from surgery or a difficult birth. Source: NHS,external All mothers are entitled to 52 weeks'maternity leave,external, while paid paternity leave is up to two weeks. Parents can also split their leave between them - up to 50 weeks' leave and 37 weeks' pay. Some employers offer more time off, at their discretion.

"For travellers, the past fortnight has brought a tidal wave of bad news. Cancelled flights, proposed rail strikes and record-breaking petrol prices have thrown people's plans into disarray - and now the peak summer holiday season and the long school break are hovering on the horizon. After more than two years of Covid restrictions, this should be a summer of fun. But are we now heading into a summer of misery? We take a look at where things stand for planes and trains over the weeks ahead. The UK air travel industry has just faced what is arguably its biggest test since coronavirus rules were lifted and it is fair to say, it has been a bumpy ride. Over the Jubilee bank holiday, which coincided with many schools' half-term breaks, 750 flights out of the UK were cancelled, according to aviation data firm Cirium. Around 466 return flights were axed. Although cancellations made up a small percentage of total flights, many passengers were only informed at short notice and faced long queues to check-in bags and get through security. Staff shortages from job cuts made at the height of the pandemic have been driving cancellations and delays, heightening holidaymakers' anxiety that problems will continue into the key summer season. Why are so many flights being cancelled? What are my rights if my flight is cancelled? Add to that the threat of strike action. British Airways workers have voted in favour of supporting industrial action, in a ballot conducted by the Unite union, while Ryanair is facing walkouts by staff in parts of Europe. Jess Baker has been put off travelling abroad this summer after a recent ""nightmare"" 18-hour journey home from Iceland. She, her husband Shaun and their two children had their EasyJet flight into Luton cancelled on Monday. They were given the option to travel home on Thursday but needed to get back sooner so paid Â£1,000 to fly into Glasgow with Icelandair. They shelled out an additional Â£340 to hire a car to drive down to Luton to collect their own vehicle. Jess Baker and her family had their EasyJet flight cancelled from Iceland to Luton ""It's been an absolute nightmare,"" says Ms Baker. ""We quickly decided that we'll go camping here instead. It's not worth the hassle all over again."" Others may have the same idea. Sykes Holiday Cottages says it has seen a 22% rise in bookings in the past two weeks compared to the same period last year. Chief executive Graham Donoghue says it is ""at least in part due to widespread reports of overseas travel disruption"". ""Travellers simply don't want to have to tackle airports and take the risk that their family holidays could be cancelled,"" he says. Since cutting staff, airlines, airports and the companies that provide baggage handling have been recruiting but because new workers have to pass security checks, it takes time. Heathrow airport's boss John Holland-Kayerecently told the Financial Times,externalit could take up to 18 months for the aviation sector to ""fully recover capacity"". Aviation consultant Chris Tarry tells the BBC the situation should improve as more staff are security cleared, but he warns there are ""unlikely to be enough workers in certain areas given wages and working conditions"". And airports ""only work if all of the elements are in place"", he says. Glastonbury Festival returns this year on 22 June, but it might not be that easy to get there now rail strikes have been announced. More than 40,000 RMT Union members from Network Rail and 13 train operators are set to walk out after talks over pay and redundancies broke down. The strikes are due to take place on 21, 23 and 25 June but it is likely services across the whole week will be disrupted. Train drivers are also going to hold their own strikes over pay. Passengers have been advised not to travel on trainsunless necessary during the strikes. Zahid Fayyaz, a solicitor from Brixton who is planning to travel to Glastonbury by train, is worried about the impact the potential strikes might have. Zahid Fayyaz is having to change his travel plans to get to Glastonbury Festival He originally had a ticket for 23 June but because of the planned strike on that day he and his two friends have bought new tickets to travel the day before. It cost them Â£240 and an extra day off work. ""It's going to take an extra two hours, but aside from this I'll be fine. But other people won't be able to take time off work or afford the extra money,"" the 40-year-old says. Railway workers to strike over three days in June When is the rail strike and which lines will be affected? Unions branded selfish by No 10 over rail strikes Mr Fayyaz says he is broadly sympathetic to the rail workers striking, but believes the ""timing is wrong"". Glastonbury Festival is one of several events impacted by potential travel disruption, along with a cricket test match between England and New Zealand in Leeds.  Glastonbury22-26 Third TestHeadingley 23-27 Ed SheeranWembley 25 Some people are switching their mode of transport to buses and coaches. Chris Hardy, managing director of National Express, said the firm had seen an increase in enquiries and bookings during the days of the rail strikes. The walkout could yet be called off if all parties can reach an agreement. That's what John Kuehne, from Fort Lauderdale in Florida, is hoping for. John Kuehne, a Yes fan from Florida, faces rail disruption during his trip to the UK He's traveling to England along with many of his friends from around the world to see prog-rock legends Yes, who are performing at London's Royal Albert Hall on 21 June. But ""everything is up in the air"" now, he says. ""Car rentals, parking, fuel, tolls, and congestion zone fees make it very expensive and inconvenient."" Mr Kuehne also happens to be arriving in the UK just as the cost of filling an average family car hit Â£100 for the first time. He says labour disputes happen but that ""all sides need to come together quickly to find a reasonable solution"". ""What they do in the next two weeks will affect the lives of thousands of people who just want the wonderful experience of modern British mass transit.""

"MPs have said there is ""no clear evidence"" the Rwanda scheme will stop risky Channel crossings Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak have vowed to toughen controls on migration into the UK as part of their bids to become next Tory leader and prime minister. Mr Sunak said he would tighten the definition of who qualifies for asylum and introduce a cap on refugee numbers. Ms Truss said she would extend the UK's Rwanda asylum plan and increase the number of Border Force staff. More than 14,000 migrants have crossed the Channel to the UK on small boats so far this year. In an attempt to deter the crossings, in April the government announced it would send some asylum seekers deemed to have entered the UK illegally to Rwanda to claim refuge there. However, no asylum seekers have been sent to the east-African country yet following a series of legal challenges. The UK stands to lose the Â£120m it has paid to Rwanda if the plan is ruled unlawful by the courts at an upcoming hearing. Both leadership hopefuls said they would explore similar deals with other countries. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss told the Mail on Sunday the Rwanda policy was the right approach and that she was determined to""see it through to full implementation"",external. Ms Truss also said that if she became Tory Party leader and prime minister, she would increase Border Force staffing from 9,000 to 10,800. She has also promised a strengthened UK bill of rights, adding: ""I'm determined to end the appalling people trafficking we're seeing."" Why do migrants leave France for the UK? Why are asylum seekers being sent to Rwanda? How many people cross the Channel? Former chancellor Mr Sunak has also pledged to do ""whatever it takes"" to make the Rwanda scheme work and described the UK's migration policy as ""broken"" and ""chaotic"". His plans would see the UK re-assessing aid, trade terms and visa options on the basis of a country's willingness to co-operate with the return of failed asylum seekers and offenders. He has also promised to give Parliament control over how many come to the UK by creating an annual cap on the number of refugees accepted each year, though this could be changed in the case of emergencies. And he said he would introduce ""enhanced powers"" to detain, tag and monitor those entering the UK illegally. He said: ""Right now the system is chaotic, with law-abiding citizens seeing boats full of illegal immigrants coming from the safe country of France with our sailors and coastguards seemingly powerless to stop them."" Migration and tax plans are the latest issues to emerge in the Tory Party leadership contest But shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper criticised the pair's proposals, saying they were wasting taxpayers' money on the Rwanda scheme. She said: ""The Conservatives have been in power for 12 years. It beggars belief that they claim to be the ones to sort things out when they have both failed for so long."" Last month, 47 people were told they would be flown to Rwanda, with a flight booked for 14 June. But after a series of legal challenges the flight was cancelled. Another flight has not yet been scheduled. Earlier this week, a Commons select committee cast doubt on the effectiveness of the scheme, saying there was""no clear evidence""it would stop risky Channel crossings. On Saturday, the two candidates clashed over their tax plans. Ms Truss rejected Mr Sunak's criticism that it would be wrong to raise government borrowing to fund tax cuts - a major policy difference between the candidates. She is pledging around Â£30bn in immediate tax cuts, arguing they will boost growth, while Mr Sunak has said immediate cuts could fuel already-soaring inflation. Conservative Party members are due to start receiving ballot papers this week and the winner will be announced on 5 September. Mr Sunak, who quit as part of the government mutiny against Boris Johnson, topped the MPs' ballots to qualify for the final run-off with Ms Truss. But polls currently suggest the foreign secretary is the favoured candidate of party members, who decide the leader. It is thought a significant chunk of the 160,000 or so Tory members will vote in the coming weeks. Hustings will take place throughout July and August, and the two candidates will square off in a live BBC TV debate on Monday, followed by another hosted by The Sun and TalkTV on Tuesday.

"This video can not be played A family waiting to board a Eurotunnel train had to wait almost 24 hours in queues There are signs of an easing in the gridlock that has frustrated holidaymakers and hauliers trying to cross the Channel in recent days. The AA motoring group says the time to reach the check-in desk at the Eurotunnel terminal in Folkestone, Kent, is now under two hours. It suggests that if congestion continues to ease, traffic could be back to normal by mid to late evening. It follows three days of tailbacks at the Port of Dover and Folkestone. Overnight, people reported sleeping in cars on the road as the approach to the Eurotunnel remained gridlocked, leading the AA to brand it the ""hotspot of holiday hell"". One tired family said the last three miles of their journey took 21 hours. Traffic built up on the roads leading to the Eurotunnel terminal after the M20 motorway through Kent to the south coast was closed to cars from Maidstone to Folkestone because of Operation Brock, where lorries are diverted to park on the motorway. With the motorway shut, car drivers were diverted to smaller roads which got jammed and caused miles of tailbacks. Shortly before 18:00 BST on Sunday, the National Highways agency tweeted that the coastbound stretch of the M20 between junctions 11 and 12 had reopened to non-freight traffic but it remains closed between junctions 8 and 11. The Kent Resilience Forum, which co-ordinates the county's emergency planning, sent food and drink to people stuck in long traffic queues around Folkestone. Thousands travelling to France face third day of delays Andrew Dyer-Smith and his family, who have travelled to France for their summer holiday, spent 21 hours in bumper-to-bumper traffic on roads around Folkestone. ""We arrived at Folkestone at 9am yesterday morning for a train at 10.30 and then have been slowly crawling along for the last 21-plus hours,"" he told the BBC. He said his children were dishevelled but had managed some sleep, while he and his wife had taken the wheel in shifts to snatch some rest. While speaking live to the BBC, the family erupted in cheers as they were finally able to board the train. John Keefe, Eurotunnel's director of public affairs, said he was confident the ""bit we manage"" - from check-in to departure - was working. ""The roads outside are beyond our remit. We're responsible for managing the service - it's the only place we have any responsibility, any authority,"" he said. He said passengers were always told to turn up 30 minutes to two hours before departure to ensure they got on. But one frustrated listener said it took four hours to get on a train, on top of 15 hours trying to move five miles outside Folkestone. ""They left us on those roads - elderly, those with disabilities, families, children,"" she said. ""The children were getting into their pyjamas at the side of the road and brushing their teeth where every man, woman and child had been using the bathroom."" She added that the queues on the A20 coming into the terminal were all Eurotunnel's passengers with no water, no facilities, nothing. ""We were treated worse than cattle,"" she said. This video can not be played Watch: Aerial footage of thousands of lorries stacked on M20 outside Dover Problems began on Friday, and a major incident was declared as routes to the port and Eurotunnel became gridlocked. The Dover delays led to a war of words between French and UK officials, with both sides blaming the other. The UK government said French authorities failed to provide enough border staff to check passports at Dover over the weekend. But French Transport Minister Clement Beaune rejected this and highlighted additional border checks brought on by Brexit. By mid-morning on Sunday, the port said it had cleared the backlog of tourist passengers and was running as normal. On the M20, many of the lorries have been released but 600 still remain, according to the Kent Resilience Forum. Operation Brock involves EU-bound lorries parking on an M20 carriageway until space becomes available for a Channel crossing on the ferry from Dover or on the Eurotunnel. Steve Gooding, of the RAC Foundation, blamed the operation for ""massive disruption"" and called for government investment for extra lorry parking. Natalie Chapman, from haulier group Logistics UK, said some lorry drivers had waited for ""well over 18 hours"" in queues over the weekend with no toilet facilities. Kent County Council and the Road Haulage Association also want the government to build more lorry parks. The Department for Transport said it was investing more than Â£30m to improve facilities in England. Father-of-three Manesh Luthra left Essex with his family for their summer holiday at 4am on Saturday. Within two hours, they were just outside the Eurotunnel terminal in Folkestone, and were hopeful they would make their 7.50am shuttle. But, as he tells the BBC: ""We joined the back of the queue for what was the worst 21 hours experienced. ""We moved metres in hours."" His family wanted to give up at times because there was no information, support or supplies, he said. Other drivers were cutting into the queue, he adds. ""It was savage, I was worried there would be an accident."" The family eventually got to France at 10pm and travelled two more hours, but were so exhausted they stopped overnight at a hotel in Rouen, northern France. On Sunday morning, they set off again. ""I'm calm now but at various points we all broke down,"" says Manesh. Has your journey been affected by the delays crossing the Channel?

"Symptoms of monkeypox include a rash which starts on the face and spreads to the body Cases of monkeypox - a rare, little-known disease - are being investigated in European countries including the UK, as well as in the US, Canada and Australia. In the UK there have been around 3,400 confirmed cases since May. Infections are usually mild and the risk to the general population is low, but stocks of a vaccine to guard against the virus are set to run out in the UK - although 100,000 more jabs are due to arrive in September. Monkeypox is caused by the monkeypox virus, a member of the same family of viruses as smallpox, although it is much less severe and experts say chances of infection are low. It occurs mostly in remote parts of central and west African countries, near tropical rainforests. In those regions, there have been more than 1,200 cases of monkeypox since the start of the year. Two main strains of the virus - west African and central African - are known to exist, and it's the milder one from west Africa which is now circulating in other regions of the world. The unusually high numbers of people infected with monkeypox outside of Africa with no travel links to the region, means the virus is now spreading in the community. TheUK Health Security Agency,externalsays anyone concerned they could be infected should phone NHS 111 or contact their local sexual health clinic, but call or email ahead of a visit. It is also advising those infected not to have sex while they have symptoms and use condoms for eight weeks after an infection, as a precaution. Monkeypox cases rise as new UK sex advice issued What is Monkeypox? James Gallagher explains what it is and if we should be worried. Available now on BBC iPlayer Initial symptoms include fever, headaches, swellings, back pain, aching muscles. Once the fever breaks a rash can develop, often beginning on the face, then spreading to other parts of the body, most commonly the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. The rash, which can be extremely itchy or painful, changes and goes through different stages before finally forming a scab, which later falls off. The lesions can cause scarring. The infection usually clears up on its own and lasts between 14 and 21 days. Monkeypox can be spread when someone is in close contact with an infected person. The virus can enter the body through broken skin, the respiratory tract or through the eyes, nose or mouth. It has not previously been described as a sexually transmitted infection, but it can be passed on by close contact. Guidance,externalis advising anyone with the virus to abstain from sex while they have symptoms. While there is currently no available evidence that monkeypox can be spread in sexual fluids, people confirmed to have the virus are advised to use condoms for eight weeks after infection as a precaution. It can also be spread by contact with infected animals such as monkeys, rats and squirrels, or by virus-contaminated objects, such as bedding and clothing. Monkeypox virus particle Most cases of the virus are mild, sometimes resembling chickenpox, and clear up on their own within a few weeks. Monkeypox can sometimes be more severe. Twelve people have died worldwide with it in the most recent outbreak, but none in the UK. Although some of the cases have been seen in gay and bisexual men, anyone who comes into close contact with someone who has monkeypox could potentially get the virus. The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has said ""a notable proportion"" of the recent cases in the UK and Europe have been found in gay and bisexual men ""so we are particularly encouraging them to be alert to the symptoms and seek help if concerned"". Monkeypox: Handing out health advice without stigma The virus was first identified in a captive monkey and since 1970 there have been sporadic outbreaks reported across 10 African countries. In 2003 there was an outbreak in the US, the first time it had been seen outside Africa. Patients caught the disease from close contact with prairie dogs that had been infected by small mammals imported into the country. A total of 81 cases were reported, but none resulted in deaths. In 2017, Nigeria experienced the largest known outbreak. There were 172 suspected cases and 75% of victims were men between 21 and 40 years old. Outbreaks can be controlled by infection prevention. Vaccination against smallpox has been proven to be 85% effective in preventing monkeypox. TheUK has bought tens of thousands of doses of the smallpox vaccineand those at high risk of being infected, plus some high-risk close contacts - including some healthworkers - are being offered one. Antiviral drugs may also help and the UK has approved one, called tecovirimat, for this. Health protection teams are contacting people who've come into close contact with confirmed cases and are at high risk. They are offering advice and monitoring them.

"Travellers heading to France are facing delays of several hours amid continuing gridlock on roads near Dover and the Eurotunnel terminal in Folkestone. More than 17,000 passengers had left Dover on ferries by lunchtime on one of the busiest weekends of the year. P&O Ferries warned customers to allow three to four hours to clear local roads and security checks on Saturday. Passengers using Eurotunnel also faced lengthy delays on the journey to the Folkestone terminal. Are UK travellers heading for a summer of misery? This weekend is one of the busiest for UK overseas travel as most schools in England and Wales have broken up for the summer. Families travelling to the Eurotunnel terminal told the BBC they faced delays of more than six hours amid heavy congestion around Folkestone. Passengers using Eurotunnel were asked to arrive two hours early by the operator. John Keefe, director of public affairs for Eurotunnel, said traffic disruption had been caused by an accident on the M20 on Friday, and stretches of the road being used solely for freight traffic, with holidaymakers diverted on to A-roads. Saturday's delays follow long waits on Friday when a major incident was declared after routes around the Kent terminals were in gridlock and traffic queues four miles long also formed on the eastbound M2. This video can not be played Thousands of lorries stacked on M20 outside Dover A war of words broke out between UK and French officials over the cause of the disruption. In a visit to Kent on Saturday afternoon, Tory leadership candidate and Foreign Secretary Liz Truss claimed delays at Dover ferry port were down to a lack of French border staff. She said: ""I'm very clear that we need to see action from them to resolve the terrible situation that people are facing."" But Calais MP Pierre-Henri Dumont rejected this and said additional checks post-Brexit and a lack of capacity at the port were behind the problem. He also told BBC News the Port of Dover was ""too small"" and there were too few kiosks due to lack of space. Some 3,000 lorries are also waiting to cross the Channel. They are currently parked on the M20 outside Dover, while holiday traffic is prioritised. Natalie Chapman, from haulier group Logistics UK, said some lorry drivers had waited to cross the Channel for ""well over 18 hours"" in queues with no toilet facilities. Jane Dennis and her family managed to escape the gridlock after six hours by taking a detour Jane Dennis, her husband and their five children, aged between three and 11, barely moved for six hours while trying to reach the Eurotunnel terminal. Between around 7am and 1pm they advanced approximately 70 metres before deciding to take a detour that friends had used. ""We hit the queue at about 07:05 BST, and we left the queue six hours later at about 13:10 BST, when we'd travelled 70 metres or so,"" she told the BBC. ""Literally inching a couple of cars' worth forward every hour."" She said the traffic queues weren't being managed by anyone, adding: ""It was just the way the gridlock happened, the one we were in initially there was nowhere for people to budge."" Once they made the detour, traffic was flowing freely on other roads. They eventually arrived in France 12 hours after setting off from home in Hampshire, and had to try to find a hotel to stay in overnight, before continuing their journey to a campsite in Vendee on Sunday. Anna Parkinson faced long delays while travelling with her three children. Holidaymaker Anna Parkinson took seven hours to travel two miles to the Eurotunnel terminal - with three ""fractious"" children sat in the back. She said she felt for local residents who ""currently can't leave their local villages because they're hemmed in by all of us desperately trying to get on the train that we should have caught five hours ago"". Tim Povall, travelling to Budapest with his wife, two sons and their dog, had been queuing for nearly seven hours when he spoke to the BBC, meaning their planned stopover in Bruges was disrupted. He says there should have been better organisation at Folkestone to avoid a ""free-for-all"". ""It's ruined this evening. My two sons are angry and my dog isn't happy. It just doesn't make sense. ""There are lots of pregnant people and people with kids walking around. It's hot, I feel sorry for them."" By Dan Johnson, BBC News We're told that things are flowing a bit more freely and that they are starting to eat into that backlog that built up yesterday. There are a lot of cars queuing here at the port at the moment. But in a sense this is the good queue. This is the queue you want to be part of. The problem is that thousands of people are stuck on the roads miles out from Dover trying to get across Kent to the port. They've been held back by the police operations that have been in place to try to manage the traffic, to try to stop Dover itself getting completely snarled up. And that does seem to have been a bit more successful today, but drivers are still being warned that they do face big delays. Has your journey been affected by the delays in Dover?
