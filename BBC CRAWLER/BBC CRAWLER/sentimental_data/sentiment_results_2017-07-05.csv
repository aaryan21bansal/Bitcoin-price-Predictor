"This video can not be played America's UN ambassador Nikki Haley says the US is prepared to defend itself and its allies The US has said it will use its ""considerable military forces"" on North Korea ""if we must"", following Tuesday's long-range missile test. US ambassador Nikki Haley said a new resolution would also be tabled against Pyongyang at the United Nations. She described the test as a sharp military escalation and also threatened to use trade restrictions. Hours after she spoke, the US and South Korea fired more missiles into the Sea of Japan as part of military drills. But Pyongyang said it would not negotiate unless the US ended its ""hostile policy"" against North Korea. China and Russia also opposed the use of military force. Tuesday's missile launch, the latest in a series of tests, was in defiance of a ban by the UN Security Council. Is the new missile test a game-changer? Can the US defend itself against N Korea? Possible solutions to crisis Meanwhile, US Defence Secretary Jim Mattis and his Japanese counterpart Tomomi Inada said the test was an ""unacceptable provocation"". Gen Mattis said the US was committed to defending Japan and providing deterrence,according to a statement released by the US defence department,externalafter their phone call. This video can not be played North Korea missile launch: What we do know and don't know On Wednesday Ms Haley warned North Korea's test launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) was ""quickly closing off the possibility of a diplomatic solution"". ""The United States is prepared to use the full range of our capabilities to defend ourselves, and our allies,"" she told an emergency session of the UN Security Council. ""One of our capabilities lies with our considerable military forces. We will use them, if we must, but we prefer not to have to go in that direction."" On Thursday in South Korea, the US held a joint military drill with the South's troops for a second day in response to the missile test. It involved various destroyers, warships and fighter jets launching guided missiles against a simulated maritime attack, Yonhap news agency reports. 'Worst tension since Korean War', says former US envoy The South Korean destroyer Yang Manchun was seeing firing an anti-ship missile Ms Haley also said the US could cut off trade with countries which continued to trade with North Korea in violation of UN resolutions. ""We will look at any country that chooses to do business with this outlaw regime,"" she said. Earlier, US President Donald Trumpcriticised China for its trade with North Korea. Mr Trump is due to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping when they attend a G20 summit in Hamburg, Germany, where world leaders are expected to discuss the missile test. Why is Donald Trump going to Poland? South Korea's President Moon Jae-in has voiced concern that the North's nuclear and missile development is ""proceeding much faster than expected"". Speaking in Berlin on Wednesday, where he met German leader Angela Merkel, he said they would ""examine possibilities of ramping up sanctions"". At the UN Security Council meeting in New York, France's ambassador said it also favoured a new resolution on North Korea to tighten sanctions. This video can not be played Why Trump only has bad North Korea options, as the BBC's Korea correspondent Steve Evans explains Russia, which condemned the test, said the possibility of using military measures ""should be excluded"". China's ambassador Liu Jieyi echoed similar sentiments and said ""military means must not be an option"". He repeated China and Russia's proposal that North Korea should halt its missile and nuclear programmes in exchange for US and South Korean military exercises in the region being frozen. They also propose reversing plans to deploy a controversial anti-missile system in the South. Both Russia and China are permanent members of the UN Security Council and could veto any new resolution. The ""US strategy of strength"" combined with pressure and engagement ""will never work"", state news agency KCNA said. Unless the US stopped its ""hostile policy"", North Korea would ""never put the nuke and ballistic rocket on the negotiating table"". North Korean state TV said the launch was overseen by leader Kim Jong-un North Korean leader Kim Jong-un was earlier quoted as saying Tuesday's launch was a ""gift"" to the Americans on their independence day, and that he had ordered officials to ""frequently send big and small 'gift packages' to the Yankees"". Pyongyang said the Hwasong-14 ICBM had reached an altitude of 2,802km (1,731 miles) and flown 933km for 39 minutes before hitting a target in the sea. North Korea, it said, was now ""a full-fledged nuclear power that has been possessed of the most powerful inter-continental ballistic rocket capable of hitting any part of the world"". But while experts agree that the test shows Pyongyang has a long-range projectile, many are sceptical that its missiles can successfully deliver warheads. Have North Korea's missile tests paid off? A long-range missile usually designed to carry a nuclear warhead The minimum range is 5,500km (3,400 miles), although most fly about 10,000km or more Pyongyang has previously displayed two types of ICBMs: the KN-08, with a range of 11,500km, and the KN-14, with a range of 10,000km, but before 4 July had not claimed to have flight tested an ICBM. It is not clear what differentiates the Hwasong-14 North Korea's missile programme in detail Have missile tests paid off? What can the outside world do about N Korea?

"Jeremy Corbyn is to speak to the organisers of the Glastonbury festival about their use of zero-hours contracts, his spokesman has said. The Labour leader appeared on stage at last month's event to speak about employment rights among other issues. Most of the workers hired, from around Europe, to clean up after the festival were reportedly laid off early. But organisers said the litter pickers had ""temporary"" agreements which guaranteed at least eight hours work. In a statement, Glastonbury festival said the ""unusually dry"" weather was partly responsible for reducing the amount of work after this year's festival. According to the Independent,external, about 700 workers had travelled to Somerset from the Czech Republic, Spain, Poland and Latvia to help with the post-festival clean-up operation, on zero-hours contracts. They were reportedly promised two weeks' paid work but were laid-off after two days because there was less litter than expected, leaving them stranded and out of pocket. In a video filmed by the Independent, a supervisor is heard telling sacked workers obstructing vehicles in protest that they should be grateful for two days' work. Mr Corbyn used his appearance on the festival's Pyramid stage to say young people should not have to ""accept low wages and insecurity as just part of life"". Asked whether he would boycott Glastonbury in future, Mr Corbyn's spokesman said: ""Jeremy and the Labour Party have taken a very strong stand against the use of zero-hours contracts and the exploitation of migrant and other workers, and we would take that view wherever it happened. ""How Glastonbury runs its event and runs its finances is entirely a matter for them. ""But these contracts should not be in place and shouldn't be used. ""We oppose them, and next time we are in government we will ban them."" Asked whether Mr Corbyn would raise the issue with organisers next time he visits the festival, the spokesman said: ""He is happy to raise it right now. ""This kind of contract and these kinds of employment conditions are unacceptable."" In a statement, Glastonbury festival denied they had used zero-hours contracts, saying: ""We would like to state that Glastonbury festival's post-event litter picking team are all given temporary worker agreements for the duration of the clean-up. ""The length of the clean-up varies considerably from year to year, based largely upon the weather conditions before, during and after the festival. ""This is something the litter pickers - many of whom return year after year - are made aware of in their worker agreements (which assure them of a minimum of eight hours' work). ""This year was an unusually dry one for Glastonbury. That, coupled with a fantastic effort from festival goers in taking their belongings home, meant that the bulk of the litter picking work was completed after 2.5 days (in 2016, a very wet year, the equivalent period was around 10 days).""

"This video can not be played Kensington and Chelsea Council's new leader, Elizabeth Campbell, spoke after attending a residents' meeting Foreign nationals directly affected by the Grenfell Tower fire are to be allowed to stay in the UK for 12 months regardless of their immigration status. The Home Office said it would not conduct immigration checks on survivors and those coming forward with information. Labour called for a wider ""amnesty"". Meanwhile, ministers haveordered a taskforce to help run Kensington and Chelsea Council, which has faced heavy criticism for its handling of disaster. The specialist team will take over the running of key services, including housing and the longer term recovery of the area in North Kensington. At least 80 people died in the fire on 14 June. Reality Check: The Grenfell rehousing promise Grenfell Tower inquiry 'will be broad' Will a public inquiry deliver answers? The Home Office said its priority was to see residents ""deal with the extremely difficult circumstances"" so they could start to rebuild their lives. In a written statement to Parliament, Home Office minister Brandon Lewis said: ""Everyone affected by this tragedy needs reassurance that the government is there for them at this terrible time and we will continue to provide the support they need to help them through the difficult days, weeks and months to come."" He said extending the period of leave to remain for foreign residents affected by the fire would also allow them to assist the police and other authorities with their inquiries. Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said the government should give permanent residency to the residents. ""Some survivors have literally lost everything in this horrific tragedy, all their possessions, homes and loved ones,"" she said. ""The idea that on top of this they could be deported later is grotesque."" A statement from the Met Police said 250 specialist investigators were working on the inquiry into the fire and the last visible human remains were removed from Grenfell Tower on Monday. Met Police Commander Stuart Cundy said there had been a total of 87 ""recoveries"" but, due to the ""catastrophic damage"" inside, that did not mean 87 people. So far, 21 people have been formally identified and their families informed. Grenfell Tower fire: Who were the victims? More inquests into the deaths of victims have been opened, with the Westminster coroner hearing the body of one of the oldest people to have been killed was identified by dental records. Dr Fiona Wilcox was told the body of 84-year-old Sheila, formerly known as Sheila Smith, was found on the 16th floor, while Vincent Chiejina, 60, was recovered from the 17th floor and identified by DNA. This video can not be played Alok Sharma was close to tears when making a statement Earlier, housing minister Alok Sharma fought back tears as he told the Commons of hearing ""harrowing accounts"" from survivors, saying it had been the most ""humbling and moving experience of my life"". Only 14 out of the 158 affected families have accepted offers of temporary accommodation but ministers say no-one will be forced to move. Mr Sharma said 19 families ""have not yet been ready to engage"" in the process of being rehoused, while others were waiting for offers of permanent tenancy and many were still in hotels. But he acknowledged some residents still had a ""lack of trust"" in the authorities. Elizabeth Campbell, who is taking over as the new Kensington and Chelsea Council leader, denied the council was ""being taken over by outside commissioners"" after the government sent in a taskforce to run some of its services. ""We have asked people to come because we need more help because this is something on a national scale,"" she said. ""We will do absolutely everything we can as a council to help our community and to help our community heal."" The mood is tense in the area surrounding Grenfell Tower. Many residents have been living in small hotel rooms, with four people crammed into each room. They are desperately trying to carry on with their lives by taking their children to school and going to work. But the stark reality is that they are not in a place they can call home. Both adults and children are having trouble sleeping, waking up to nightmares of the tower burning. One parent explained that his daughter kept drawing pictures of the building on fire. Despite counselling sessions on offer at local community centres, residents say they want people to visit them at their hotel. They feel the help should be coming to them. They say they should not be going in search of help. Many are traumatised and feel they are not being treated like victims. This is causing hostility and anger towards the services. Many have also turned down offers of temporary accommodation. Residents say they want to move into somewhere permanent and nearby. Many explain they have been offered numerous places that simply are not suitable due to the size, location and disabled access. The newly-elected Labour MP for Kensington, MP Emma Dent Coad, told Mr Sharma that some residents were being offered ""totally unsuitable accommodation"". The retired judge chairing the public inquiry into the fire has promised to hear from people directly affected. The judge leading the inquiry has vowed to listen to the concerns of residents Sir Martin Moore-Bick, who has faced calls to stand down,initially suggested the inquiry may not be broad enough to satisfy survivors. Launching aconsultation document,,externalthe retired judge said: ""I am determined to establish the causes of the tragedy, and ensure that the appropriate lessons are learnt. ""To produce a report as quickly as possible, with clear recommendations for action, I will listen to people and consider a broad range of evidence, including on the role of the relevant public authorities and contractors, in order to help me answer the important questions."" Earlier, the government said 190 buildings in England that underwent fire tests on their cladding - a renovation that is thought to have contributed to the spread of the Grenfell Tower fire - have failed.  It also announced that cladding from one building had passed the test - the only sample to do so to date. In the afternoon, emergency teams working on the shell of Grenfell Tower were temporarily withdrawn after sensors in the building showed it had shifted more than 5mm. The public were said to be at ""no risk"" and the work later restarted. But the use of air horns to alert crews was reported to have ""upset"" some neighbours of nearby blocks, prompting officials to say the practice would not be repeated in future.

"Jurors were told there were similarities between the cases of Caroline Devlin (left) and Susan Nicholson A man has been found guilty of killing two girlfriends five years apart. Robert Trigg, 52, was convicted of the murder of 52-year-old Susan Nicholson in 2011, and the manslaughter of Caroline Devlin, 35, in March 2006. Trigg, of Park Crescent, Worthing, West Sussex, had denied the charges, claiming they had died in their sleep. He will be sentenced at Lewes Crown Court on Thursday after a jury took six-and-a-half hours to reach its verdicts following a 10-day trial. Live: More on this story and other news from Sussex The women's deaths at their homes in Worthing were initially treated as not being suspicious. The death of Ms Devlin, whose body was found by one of her four children on Mother's Day, was originally recorded as an aneurysm. An inquest into Ms Nicholson's death ruled she died accidentally after Trigg claimed he inadvertently rolled onto her in his sleep while they were on a sofa. Robert Trigg failed to call the emergency services after the deaths of both women Trigg, who declined to give evidence in his defence, blew out his cheeks as the verdicts were announced. Jurors were told both causes of death were re-examined years later by pathologist Dr Nathaniel Cary who concluded Ms Nicholson was suffocated by having her head forced into the bed. Dr Cary found Ms Devlin's death was caused by a blow to the back of her head. The trial heard both women suffered violence at the hands of Trigg during their relationships with him. After one such incident, Ms Devlin said: ""I won't be here for my 40th."" He was described as a ""possessive, controlling and jealous"" man and by one former girlfriend as a ""Jekyll and Hyde"" character who drank heavily. This video can not be played The parents of Susan Nicholson suspected Robert Trigg was guilty The trial heard of ""striking similarities"" between the deaths, with both victims found in an unusual position and Triggfailing to call the emergency services, and getting other people to do it for him. The family of Ms Nicholson refused to accept foul play did not play a part in their daughter's death, and launched a six-year campaign to get to the truth. Elizabeth and Peter Skelton said getting justice had been ""mental torture"". ""We knew right from the start... there's no way two people could sleep on that sofa,"" Mrs Skelton said. Mr Skelton added: ""At the inquest they said Susan was lying on her back all night. ""There would be no room for anybody to sleep on their back or even lie on the rest of the sofa."" He criticised Sussex Police, saying: ""Their first investigation wasn't very good. ""That's why we had to get a barrister and a pathologist to back up our case because they wouldn't listen to us. ""We told them all the facts, even the facts that came out in court but the police still wouldn't listen, but in the end they had to listen,"" Mr Skelton said. Brandyn McKenna, the youngest son of Ms Devlin, said outside court: ""We have always said that it was all down to the Skelton family that we finally got justice."" Following the verdicts, Nigel Pilkington, from the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), said Trigg had ""a history of violence and controlling behaviour towards his partners"". ""In the face of this, it was extremely unlikely that two of Trigg's partners had died of natural causes while sharing a bed with him,"" he said. Det Supt Tanya Jones from Sussex Police said both deaths had been investigated at the time and post mortem examinations carried out. ""The forensic information available on each case at the times of the deaths did not provide any avenues for further investigation."" The parents of Susan Nicholson commissioned a review by a third pathologist and new evidence was presented to police, she said. ""On this fresh information we carried out a new thorough investigation including both deaths. ""Sussex Police are sorry that we had not presented all the facts before the CPS previously but we have now thoroughly investigated both cases.""

"Charlie Gard has been in intensive care since October It is impossible for terminally ill Charlie Gard to be transferred to the Vatican's children's hospital for treatment, Boris Johnson has said. The foreign secretary told Italian Foreign Minister Angelino Alfano legal reasons prevented him from being moved. The president of the Bambino Gesu hospital in Rome had asked British doctors if 10-month-old Charlie could be transferred to his care. It comes after the Popetweeted his support for Charlie on Monday. Charlie has been receiving specialist treatment at Great Ormond Street Hospital since October. Mr Johnson has told his Italian counterpart it is ""right that decisions continued to be led by expert medical opinion, supported  by the courts"", in line with Charlie's ""best interests."" Charlie has mitochondrial depletion syndrome, a rare genetic condition which causes progressive muscle weakness. Doctors say he cannot see, hear, move, cry or swallow. During questions to the prime minister, on Wednesday,external, Theresa May said she was ""confident"" Great Ormond Street Hospital ""have, and always will, consider any offers or new information that has come forward with consideration of the well-being of a desperately ill child"". Connie Yates and Chris Gard raised more than Â£1.3m for experimental treatment for Charlie Charlie's parents raised Â£1.3m on a crowdfunding site to pay for experimental treatment in the US. But they lost a legal battle with the hospital last month after judges at the European Court of Human Rights concluding further treatment would ""continue to cause Charlie significant harm"". The Vatican's paediatric hospital stepped in after Pope Francis called for Charlie's parents, Chris Gard and Connie Yates, to be allowed to ""accompany and treat their child until the end"". The hospital's president Mariella Enoc said: ""I was contacted by the mother, who is a very determined and decisive person and doesn't want to be stopped by anything."" Renowned scientist and genetics expert Robert Winston told ITV's Good Morning Britain that courts and doctors should not be interfering with the parents' wishes, saying the loss of a child was ""about the worst injury that any person can have"". However, he said ""interferences from the Vatican and from Donald Trump"" were ""extremely unhelpful and very cruel"". Lord Winston added: ""This child has been dealt with at a hospital which has huge expertise in mitochondrial disease and is being offered a break in a hospital that has never published anything on this disease, as far as I'm aware."" Lord Winston said ""interferences from the Vatican"" were ""unhelpful"" The Vatican said the Pope was following the case ""with affection and sadness"". A statement added: ""For [Charlie's parents] he prays, hoping that their desire to accompany and care for their own child to the end is not ignored."" US President Donald Trump also tweeted about Charlie on Monday, writing: ""If we can help little #CharlieGard, as per our friends in the UK and the Pope, we would be delighted to do so.""

"Today's productivity figures are bad to the point of shocking. A fall of 0.5% in the first three months of the year takes the UK economy's ability to create wealth back below the level of 2007. If an economy cannot create wealth efficiently, then the debates about government spending, public sector pay and austerity become all the harder. If an economy cannot create wealth, then tax receipts - the mainstay of government income - weaken. There is plenty of data which suggest that the government's inability to ""balance the books"" is not because targets to reduce spending have been missed. Rather, it is down to disappointing tax income because economic growth is weak. Poor business performance and falling real incomes appear to be leading to a stagnating economy. How motivating is work when at the end of the year you are earning, given the impact of higher inflation, less than you were at the beginning of the year? Demotivated workforces tend not to work more efficiently. And if productivity is falling and labour costs are rising, as they are, then that leads to a profits squeeze. And means that the prospect of pay rises recedes - creating something of a vicious circle and going someway to explaining why wage growth is falling. This is Philip Hammond's headache. I interviewed Lord Adair Turner, the former head of the Low Pay Commission, yesterday and he made a rather startling - but correct - admission. ""The UK over the last 10 years has created a lot of jobs, but today real wages are below where they were in 2007,"" he said. ""That is not the capitalist system delivering its promise that over a decade or so it will raise all boats, and it is a very fundamental issue. ""There is something about the economy which - left to itself - will proliferate very, very low paid jobs."" Until that is solved, our productivity problem, our wealth problem, will continue.

"A video which falsely claims to ""prove"" the existence of fake plastic rice in the food supply Despite little evidence that it's a widespread problem, rumours of ""plastic"" rice being sold in Africa and elsewhere persist on social media - driven in particular by viral videos which show bouncing rice balls. The rumours spread over the last few weeks in Senegal, The Gambia and Ghana - and reached such a pitch that the Ghana Food and Drugs Authority decided to carry out an investigation. They invited consumers and traders to submit samples of any rice brands they suspected of being made of plastic - and eventually concluded that there was no plastic rice being sold on the Ghanaian market. Visit BBC Trending onFacebook,external Originating in China, rumours on social media have circulated since about 2010 of plastic rice being manufactured and mixed in with the real rice supply in order to trick consumers. The rumours were originally prompted by ""fake rice"" scandals, although they didn't involve food made entirely out of plastic. In one case, companies were passing off ordinary but edible rice as premium ""Wuchang"" grains. Then in 2011, reports emerged that rice was being produced with potatoes and an industrial sticky resin. The rumours were further compounded when a Chinese restaurant association official warned that eating three bowls of ""plastic rice"" was the equivalent of eatingone plastic bag,external. Social media users are making videos fuelling the 'plastic rice' rumours At no point, however, were there confirmed cases of large amounts of plastic chips being passed off as rice. ""Plastic rice"" is manufactured for use in shipping boxes, but it's likely that in most cases the cost of the chips would actually be more expensive than real rice. The story had reached social media in Africa by 2016 when Nigerian customs authorities confiscated 2.5 tonnes of rice. Customs officials initially claimed that the rice was plastic - and were later forced to backtrack when the country's health ministersaid there was no evidence for the claims. Tests showed that the rice did however contain a high level of bacteria, Nigeria's National Agency For Food and Drugs said. But rumours have persisted that plastic is being sold as rice, fuelled by videos which show people bouncing rice balls. Some also purport to show how the rice is made in factories. Alexander Waugh, director of the Rice Association, a UK-based industry group, says the videos may be authentic - but not because the grains are plastic. Rice - when prepared in the right way - can actually bounce, Waugh told BBC Trending radio. ""The natural characteristics of rice are carbohydrates and proteins and you can do something like that with rice,"" Waugh says. It could be that protectionism and a distrust of foreign imports is behind the persistence of the rumours, according to journalist Alexandre Capron of France 24's, The Observers. Plastic rice rumourson BBC Trending radio Grenfell 'miracle baby': Why people invent fake victims The rise and rise of fake news Capron has worked extensively todebunk the myths,externalaround plastic rice and says some people are deliberately sharing fake videos to encourage consumers to buy more locally grown rice. ""The rumour is more popular in countries which are dependent on imported rice like Ivory Coast or Senegal,"" he says. ""The rumour is so huge that governments are compelled to make statements... as to why there is no plastic rice."" Hassan Arouni, editor of the BBC'sFocus on Africa, has looked into the ""fake rice"" rumours and says he's not sure whether people in West African countries are deliberately targeting food exporting countries such as China. But he does think food safety authorities in West Africa are doing the right thing by addressing the rumours head-on. ""I think that's the way to go and demonstrate to the public this [rumour] is not true,"" he says. ""I think it will reassure people that this is fake news and probably somebody being naughty on the internet.""

"This video can not be played Minister heckled over '64-year-old apprentices' A minister has been heckled by MPs for suggesting women over 60 facing poverty could start an apprenticeship. The government has been accused of failing to do more to help 2.6 million women born in the 1950s who have lost out because of changes to pension law. The SNP's Mhairi Black said it was ""laughable"" the problem could not be fixed when the government had found Â£1bn to fund its deal with the DUP. Minister Guy Opperman said he would look at cases of financial hardship. Waspi women protest in London over pension changes Reality Check: The fight over women's state pensions But he faced shouts of ""shame on you"" when he said the government was ""actually doing a significant amount"" to address the individual difficulties of older workers trying to enter the labour market - including by offering them apprenticeships. Mr Opperman, setting out the government's work on ""lifelong learning"" said: ""The reality is over 200,000 people over 60 have entered further education since 2014/15. ""We have also extended apprenticeship opportunities as one of the best routes to skilled employment for people of all ages and gender. ""Such apprenticeships in England, for example, in 2014/15... 12% of the starting apprenticeships were for those aged 45."" Mr Opperman was heckled by MPs as he outlined the details. SNP MP Mhairi Black said it would cost Â£8bn over five years to fix the anomaly Labour's Graham Jones, raising a point of order, said: ""I'm struggling to hear the debate, did the minister just say that women aged 64 could go on an apprenticeship course?"" The debate centred on the plight of the so-called Waspi women - Women Against State Pension Inequality - whose aim is to achieve fair transitional arrangements for women born in the 1950s, for whom the state pension age is being raised from 60 to 66 by 2020. Ms Black said she had been contacted by a woman who said her friend had committed suicide after the general election result ""because she could not face what was going to happen to her"". ""Citizens committing suicide over an issue that could be solved like that - an issue the government could do a U-turn on at any given moment,"" she said. Ms Black said it was ""an absolute disgrace"" that a debate on the issue was having to be held again. Turning to Mr Opperman, a pensions minister, she said it was ""laughable"" that the government ""can find a billion pounds for a deal to cling on to power, but we cannot find the money to give women the pensions that they are due"". ""The only other two things they are guilty of is being born in the 50s and the fact they are women.""

"The Hepworth Wakefield is named after sculptor Barbara Hepworth and has some of her works The Hepworth Wakefield gallery in West Yorkshire has beaten the Tate Modern to be crowned the UK's Museum of the Year. The venue, which opened six years ago, will receive a Â£100,000 prize from The Art Fund as well as the kudos that comes with winning the annual award. The Art Fund director Stephen Deuchar said it had been ""a powerful force of energy from the moment it opened"". Tate Modern had been nominated after a year in which it attracted a record 5.8 million visitors and opened a new wing. But that was not enough to earn it the award at a ceremony at the British Museum in London on Wednesday. The other nominees were the Lapworth Museum of Geology in Birmingham, Sir John Soane's Museum in London and the National Heritage Centre for Horseracing and Sporting Art in Suffolk. The Museum of the Year judges (with Hepworth director Simon Wallis) got tangled up in the JW Anderson exhibition The gallery sits on the banks of the River Calder The Hepworth, which is named after sculptor Barbara Hepworth, impressed the judges by increasing its visitor numbers by 21% and launchinga major new award for British sculpturelast year, among other things. Mr Deuchar praised the way the gallery had ""kept growing in reach and impact"" sinceit opened in a Â£35m buildingdesigned by David Chipperfield in 2011.

"Ukrainian cyber-security researchers have been trying to uncover the secrets of the malware's code The perpetrators of a recent cyber-attack that disrupted businesses across the world appear to have accessed the ransom payments they raised. Just over Â£7,900-worth of virtual currency has been moved from the Bitcoin address listed in the blackmail demand that appeared on hacked PCs. One expert said there was little doubt the funds had been tapped by those responsible for the crime. And it seems they have now made a fresh ransom demand. However, analysts suggest the move is intended to confuse investigations into the matter. In other related developments,Ukraine's interior minister has said,externalthe police managed to prevent a second wave of attacks by shutting down and confiscating computer servers used by a local software company, which is thought to have unwittingly helped the Petya-variant virus to spread. Ukrainian police issued this image of the confiscated computer servers And after having repeatedly denied any involvement in the transmission of the malware, the developer Intellect Service has acknowledged an upgrade to its MeDoc tax software was indeed ""contaminated"",allowing the attack to be carried out,external. ""As of today, every computer which is on the same local network as our product is a threat,"" the company's chief executive Olesya Bilousova told reporters. She added that one million computers in Ukraine had MeDoc installed on them. The police have recommended that everyone stops using the programand turns off computers,externalthat have it. Hacked computers were forced to reboot, after which they displayed this ransom demand Although the majority of the detected attacks occurred within Ukraine, according to analysis by security firm Eset the malware also affected businesses across the world. Their computers became inaccessible after the code spread over their internal networks, scrambling a part of the PCs' operating systems used to locate where files are stored. High-profile casualties included Nurofen-maker Reckitt Benckiser, Oreo cookie manufacturer Mondelez International, the shipping group Maersk and the advertising agency WPP. Most of those struck did not, however, pay the ransom demand. This was in part because the email address given by the attackers to contact them was shut down by its German operator. And until Tuesday, the funds that were raised lay dormant. The Bitcoin address used in the ransom demand has been emptied of most of its contents But at 22:32 BST on Tuesday, three transfers were triggered. Two of these were sent to Bitcoin wallets used to collect donations to the PasteBin and DeepPaste text-sharing services - platforms often used by hackers to announce their activities. The third and largest of the transfers went to an address that had previously been empty. A little later, a post appeared on DeepPaste demanding 100 bitcoins ($256,300; Â£198,500) for a ""private key to decrypt any hard disk"" affected by the attack. This message appeared on DeepPaste shortly after funds were transferred to the site's Bitcoin account ""Unless the hackers gave away the Bitcoin account linked to the original ransom demand, only they could have moved the funds,"" Prof Alan Woodward from the University of Surrey told the BBC. ""People are gobsmacked they have gone anywhere near it - they can't be daft enough to try and cash it out. ""As far as we can tell, there's no way to actually decrypt affected PCs even if you paid the new demand. ""So, it may be that they are trying to lead a false trail away from themselves."" Ukraine has accused Russia of being involved in the attack, but the Kremlin has denied any responsibility. The news site Motherboard said it spoke to someone claiming to be one of the hackers on a dark web chatroom. The supposed criminaloffered to demonstrate,externalthat they could decrypt any file scrambled by the Petya-variant. And Motherboard reports that they did indeed manage todecrypt a test file,externalafter a two hour wait. But Prof Woodward said this did not necessarily mean the key could be used to recover all the lost data. ""Once the PC's MFT [Master File Table] is corrupted the files on that disc are lost,"" he explained, referring to the fact that the virus had scrambled a critical part of the PCs' operating systems and not just individual documents. ""And as far as we can tell, there is an error in the encryption they used, so larger files can't be decrypted.""

Forced to make cuts, Mr Maduro has seen his support fall among core backers Also, as a result of the crisis, parts of Venezuela face severe shortages of basic supplies such as medicine and food The opposition accuses Mr Maduro of not only mismanaging the economy but also eroding the country's democratic institutions In March, the Supreme Court decided it would take over the National Assembly. The decision was reversed, but Mr Maduro was accused by opponents of trying to stage a coup. That sparked almost daily protests calling for his resignation Meanwhile, Mr Maduro says the opposition is trying to overthrow his government illegally, and blames the country's problems on an ""economic war"" being waged against him Just hours before, the attorney general wasfacing suspension for refusing to appear in court. Luisa Ortega DÃ­az has been accused of committing errors in her job, but critics believe she is being targeted after speaking out against the president's reform plans.

"This video can not be played The putative iceberg has been modelled using observations from the Cryosat spacecraft Everybody is fascinated by icebergs. The idea that you can have blocks of frozen water the size of cities, and bigger, sparks our sense of wonder. British astronaut Tim Peake photographed one from orbit that would just about fit inside Central London's ring road. But at 26km by 13km (16 miles by 8 miles), it was a tiddler compared with the berg that is about to break away from the eastern side of the Antarctic Peninsula. A rift has grown across the edge of the Larsen C Ice Shelf. A thin, 5km-long section of the floating shelf is now all that prevents a 6,000-sq-km berg from drifting away into the Weddell Sea. Think about the size for a moment. That's more than a quarter the area of Wales. Keen to gather some more statistics, scientists have used the Cryosat spacecraft to run the rule over the putative iceberg. As we all know, blocks of ice sit mostly under the water, and the European Space Agency (Esa) satellite has a special radar altimeter that is able to figure out by how much. From orbit, Cryosat senses the height of the ice sticking above the surface - the so-called freeboard. It's then a relatively simple calculation to work out the draft - the hidden part below water. ""Cryosat has these two radar antennas that allow us to get an extensive swath across the berg and enable us to build an elevation model,"" Dr Noel Gourmelen from the University of Edinburgh told BBC News. From this, the average thickness of the would-be berg is calculated to be about 190m, but there are places where the draft is around 210m. It means the ice above the water surface stands roughly 30m high. Dr Gourmelen says there is an estimated 1,155 cubic km of ice in the block. Iceberg 'doodles' trace climate history Antarctica's troublesome 'hairdryer winds' The graveyard of giant icebergs This is all very useful information because it tells scientists a lot about where and how fast the Larsen object might move once it becomes free. And those are critical details if the berg were to reach shipping lanes to become a navigation hazard. The drift paths (red lines) of countless bergs have been tracked around the Antarctic continent (black). This collective history strongly suggests the Larsen block will head for the South Atlantic Bergs get pushed by winds and currents, of course, but a couple of other factors also come in to play simply because of the Larsen object's sheer bulk. Remarkably, one is a gravitational effect. Winds drive sea-level higher near Antarctica's coasts compared with the centre of the ocean - by something like half a metre. The Larsen berg will actually slide down this slope under its own weight, but it will not move in a straight line. Instead, it will veer left as a result of the Coriolis force that stems from the Earth's rotation. This movement could be interrupted, though, if the berg's keel then gets snagged on the ocean bottom. Ploughmarks: The keels of icebergs will cut deep channels in sea-floor sediments The waters close to Antarctica are shallow and there's a good chance the berg will dig in, gouging a huge trough in the seafloor as it then turns round. It's called ""kedging"" - a term used by sailors, coined from the use of the kedge anchor to manipulate the course of a vessel, explains Dr Mark Drinkwater, one of Esa's senior Earth observation scientists. âThe icebergs often shoal and pivot or spin around their grounding point, resulting in stop and go motion or a change in direction. So, the iceberg from Larsen C could take some time before it escapes the shallow [waters] of the western Weddell Sea."" Dr Anna Hogg from Leeds University added: ""That said, it's not impossible it could simply become stuck on some high-rise topography on the ocean floor. We've seen that before where an iceberg becomes a semi-permanent ice island in the Weddell Sea."" The expectation, however, is that the berg will bump and grind its way northward in near-coast currents, along the Peninsula. Past history suggests it will eventually be exported on one of four major iceberg ""highways"" that lead beyond Antarctica. In this instance, the route is one that sends the berg into the circumpolar current and on to an eastward arc towards the South Atlantic. The penguins and seals on the British Overseas Territory of South Georgia may well get to see it, or its fragments, as it passes by in a few years' time. And I mean years. Prof Helen Fricker, from California's Scripps Institution of Oceanography, says she was tracking two large objects in 1993, a full seven years after their 95km-by-95km parent berg calved from the Larsen C Ice Shelf. Tim Peake's iceberg, known as A-56, was roughly 26km by 13km (16 miles by 8 miles) What's nice about Tim's berg is that he managed to capture it on a normal SLR optical camera. That's unusual because Antarctica is very often covered in cloud, and it doesn't matter how big a lens you have - the ocean surface will be obscured. It's why radar satellites are so important. The wavelengths they work at pierce cloud and winter darkness. Indeed, the only reason we know this new Larsen berg is about to calve is because Europe's Sentinel-1 radar satellites take a detailed look at the shelf's behaviour every six days. ""What the current Larsen situation has highlighted is that we're now able to monitor the situation with a frequency we've never had before,"" says Dr Hogg. ""We can get pictures from the two Sentinel-1 satellites in about half an hour of them being acquired. The satellites we have now are revolutionising our study of the polar regions,"" she told BBC News. Iceberg names follow a convention that uses a letter followed by a number Icebergs are blocks of ice that cover at least 500 sq m Any smaller and they are called ""growlers"" or ""bergy bits"" The US National Ice Center runs the naming system for bergs It divides Antarctica into quadrants - A, B, C and D Larsen icebergs get an ""A"" designation when they calve They also get the next number in the sequence of sightings Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk,externaland follow me on Twitter:@BBCAmos,external At least two killed and 1,000 structures destroyed as wildfires rage in Los Angeles Watch: Ferocious and explosive fire burns behind CBS reporter Liam Payne cause of death confirmed as UK inquest opens Where is Greenland and why does Trump want it?

"This video can not be played North Korea missile launch: What we do know and don't know Donald Trump has criticised China following North Korea's test of a long-range missile, condemning it for increasing trade with Pyongyang. ""So much for China working with us,"" the US presidenttweeted,external. The US and South Korea conducted a ballistic missile fire exercise in the Sea of Japan in response to the North. China and Russia have urged both sides to stop flexing their military muscle and said they oppose any attempts at regime change in North Korea. ""It is perfectly clear to Russia and China that any attempts to justify the use of force by referring to [United Nations] Security Council resolutions are unacceptable, and will lead to unpredictable consequences in this region which borders both the Russian Federation and the People's Republic of China,"" Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said. ""Attempts to strangle the DPRK [North Korea] economically are equally unacceptable,"" he added. The missile launch, the latest in a series of tests, was in defiance of a ban by the UN Security Council. The US has asked for an urgent meeting of the Security Council to discuss the issue. A closed-door session of the 15-member body will take place later on Wednesday. Donald and Melania Trump have left Washington for a trip to Warsaw and Hamburg The US president held talks with China's leader Xi Jinping at his Mar-a-Lago retreat in Florida in April. Mr Trumphailed ""tremendous progress"" with Chinaafter those meetings. The trade figures showing an increase in trade between China and North Korea, which he was apparently referring to in Wednesday's critical tweet,appear to relate to the period before that April meeting,external. The US president is now en route to Poland and Germany, where he will meet Mr Xi for the second time. Is the new missile test a game-changer? Can the US defend itself against N Korea? China, which is Pyongyang's main economic ally, and Russia have called on North Korea to suspend its ballistic missile programme in exchange for a halt on the large-scale military exercises by the US and South Korea. Mr Xi and Russian President Vladimir Putin, who met in Moscow on Tuesday, said ""the opposing sides should start negotiations"". Japan on Tuesday said ""repeated provocations like this are absolutely unacceptable"" and lodged a protest. Possible solutions to crisis Barbara Plett Usher, BBC State Department correspondent There's little doubt the honeymoon between Donald Trump and Xi Jinping is over. The administration is frustrated that China isn't doing more to put the squeeze on North Korea. Beijing is angry about recent moves taken by the White House, including sanctions on a Chinese bank for doing ""illicit"" business with Pyongyang, and a $1.4 billion arms sale to Taiwan. In one way this tension is neither new nor surprising - previous American presidents encountered similar resistance from Beijing, which is determined to prevent chaotic upheaval in North Korea. But the stakes are higher because Pyongyang's nuclear weapons programme is becoming more of a threat. Mr Trump might respond by imposing more sanctions on Chinese banks and front companies that deal with North Korea. But some Asia experts say China would be readier to increase economic pressure on the regime if the US took up Beijing's push for negotiations to deal with the crisis. This video can not be played Why Trump only has bad North Korea options Tuesday's launch was North Korea's first-ever test launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM). State news agency KCNA quoted leader Kim Jong-un as saying the test was a ""gift"" to the Americans on their independence day. The report warned of the possibility of more tests, saying he ordered officials to ""frequently send big and small 'gift packages' to the Yankees"". Pyongyang said earlier the Hwasong-14 ICBM had reached an altitude of 2,802km (1,731 miles) and flew 933km for 39 minutes before hitting a target in the sea. Have North Korea's missile tests paid off? North Korea, it said, was now ""a full-fledged nuclear power that has been possessed of the most powerful inter-continental ballistic rocket capable of hitting any part of the world"". A long-range missile usually designed to carry a nuclear warhead The minimum range is 5,500km (3,400 miles), although most fly about 10,000km or more Pyongyang has previously displayed two types of ICBMs: the KN-08, with a range of 11,500km, and the KN-14, with a range of 10,000km, but before 4 July had not claimed to have flight tested an ICBM. It is not clear what differentiates the Hwasong-14 North Korea's missile programme in detail Some experts believe that Tuesday's test proves that North Korea has a missile that could travel across the globe and reach Alaska. Physicist David Wright said it couldreach a maximum range of about 6,700km,externalon a standard trajectory, while South Korea's defence ministry on Wednesday put the range between 7,000 and 8,000km. But whether that missile could deliver a warhead is still a question. Pyongyang claimed the rocket carried a ""heavy warhead"" and that it ""accurately hit the targeted waters without any structural breakdown"". South Korea said there was no evidence proving the missile could withstand high temperatures and successfully re-enter the atmosphere,reported Yonhap news agency.,external Experts believe Pyongyang does not yet have the capability to miniaturise a nuclear warhead, fit it onto a long-range missile, and ensure it is protected until delivery to the target. They say many of North Korea's missiles cannot accurately hit targets. Butothers believe that,externalat the rate it is going, Pyongyang may overcome these challenges and develop a nuclear weapon that could strike the US within five to 10 years. How advanced is North Korea's nuclear programme? North Korean media released this image of Tuesday's missile launch By bringing Alaska within range, the new missile test is an unambiguous game-changer in both symbolical and practical terms. US territory (albeit separate from the contiguous continental US) is now finally within Pyongyang's cross-hairs. For the first time a US president has to accept that the North poses a ""real and present"" danger not merely to north-east Asia and America's key allies - but to the US proper. President Trump's weakness lies in having overplayed his hand too publicly and too loudly. Read more from Dr Nilsson-Wright Have missile tests paid off? What can the outside world do about N Korea?

"Professional women are freezing their eggs due to a ""dearth of educated men to marry"", a US study has claimed. Yale University researchers suggested an ""oversupply"" of graduate women left them struggling to find a partner and ""desperate"" to preserve fertility. They said the ""man deficit"" was worse in countries where more women were going to university, as in the UK. The researchers interviewed 150 women who had frozen eggs, of whom 90% said they could not find a suitable partner. Author Prof Marcia Inhorn said the research challenged perceptions that women put off having a baby so they could prioritise their job. ""Extensive media coverage suggests that educational and career ambitions are the main determinants of professional women's fertility postponement, especially as they 'lean in' to their careers,"" she said. ""Rather, they were desperately preserving their fertility beyond the natural end of their reproductive lives, because they were single without partners to marry."" Speaking at the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology conference in Geneva, Switzerland, Prof Inhorn thought there were ""not enough graduates for them"". In the majority of cases the women, who were treated at eight IVF clinics in the US and Israel and interviewed between June 2014 to August 2016, said they could not find an educated man who was willing to commit to family life. ""Women lamented the 'missing men' in their lives, viewing egg freezing as a way to buy time while on the continuing - online - search for a committed partner,"" Prof Inhorn said. Prof Adam Balen, president of the British Fertility Society, said that he had noticed a ""big shift"" in UK society, with many university-educated women delaying starting a family. ""In my clinic I certainly see more older women seeking fertility treatment than in the past,"" he said. The research comes amid a sex imbalance at British universities. In the academic year 2015-2016, 56% of UK students were women and 44% men, according to the Higher Education Statistics Agency. Prof Balen warned that freezing eggs can be a painful and costly process. ""Freezing eggs for a future pregnancy is not a decision to be taken lightly,"" he said. ""The technology in egg freezing has improved a great deal but it is still no guarantee of a baby later in life. ""Women choosing to 'bank' eggs until they are ready to start a family have to go through painful procedures and what can be a difficult regime of medications - this is not without potential risks to the woman undertaking the procedure."" In the UK, the number of women storing their eggs has increased substantially despite success rates remaining low. In 2014, 816 women froze some eggs for in vitro fertilisation (IVF) later, up 25% on 2013, according to the latestfigures,externalfrom the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA), which regulates the industry. Eggs are more fragile than embryos, and less likely to survive the freeze-thaw process. The pregnancy rate for transferring frozen embryos was 21.9% in 2013, and 22.2% in 2014. The law allows for eggs to be frozen for up to 10 years, and in some circumstances up to 55 years. Egg-freezing can cost several thousand pounds, with added costs for storing the eggs, while one cycle of IVF treatment may cost up to Â£5,000 or more.

"Newcastle United owner Mike Ashley (left) arrives at the High Court to give evidence Billionaire Mike Ashley said a claim that he agreed to pay a finance expert Â£15m during a drinking session in a pub is ""nonsense"". Investment banker Jeffrey Blue said the Newcastle United owner promised to pay him Â£15m if he increased Sports Direct's share price to Â£8 each. He was paid Â£1m but is suing Mr Ashley for the rest at London's High Court. Mr Ashley said it ""would be obvious"" to anyone at the pub where they were drinking that he ""was not serious"". Mr Ashley told Mr Justice Leggatt, in a witness statement, he met Mr Blue and three other finance specialists at the Horse And Groom pub in central London in January 2013. ""When we got to the pub we started drinking heavily at the bar and consumed a lot of alcohol during the evening,"" Mr Ashley told the judge. ""We must have had four or five rounds of drinks in the first hour. ""I can't remember the detail of conversations but I do remember that we had a lot of drinks and a lot of banter. Finance expert Jeffrey Blue claims he was promised Â£15m for pushing up the price of shares ""We were pulling each other's legs about what hypothetical value my shares would be worth 'on paper' at different share prices. ""It was a fun night, as it was intended to be, and everyone was on good form."" Mr Ashley said the group went to another bar afterwards but could not remember which one. He said: ""I find it incredible that Mr Blue is actually suggesting that I made a binding agreement for Â£15m. ""It's nonsense. ""If I did say to Mr Blue that I would pay him Â£15m, it would be obvious to everyone, including Mr Blue, that I wasn't being serious."" Mr Ashley said the inference that Sports Direct had senior management meetings in a pub was ""100% incorrect"". He said he occasionally made decisions in a pub. ""Definitely not as a norm,"" he said. ""Otherwise I would have to live in a pub."" He added: ""I take business decisions all day every day, from home, from the bath."" Mr Ashley told the judge: ""Serious, serious decisions are not done on drunken nights out."" What Mr Blue called ""senior management meetings"" at pubs was actually just a ""drink after work"", Mr Ashley said. He also said ""going for a drink"" was ""what we do after work"" and Shirebrook, Derbyshire, where Sports Direct is based, was a ""very boring, lonely place"". The case continues.

"This video can not be played Alok Sharma was close to tears when making a statement The government has ordered a taskforce to take over parts of Kensington and Chelsea Council in the aftermath of the Grenfell Tower fire. The council has been heavily criticised for its handling of the disaster on 14 June that killed at least 80 people. Both the council leader and chief executive have resigned as a result. Only 14 out of the 158 affected families have accepted offers of temporary accommodation but ministers say no-one will be forced to move. Housing minister Alok Sharma fought back tears as he told the Commons of hearing ""harrowing accounts"" from survivors, saying it had been the most ""humbling and moving experience of my life"". He said 19 families ""have not yet been ready to engage"" in the process of being rehoused, while others were waiting for offers of permanent tenancy and many were still in hotels. Reality Check: The Grenfell rehousing promise Grenfell Tower inquiry 'will be broad' Will a public inquiry deliver answers? A statement from the Met Police said 250 specialist investigators were working on the operation and the last visible human remains were removed from Grenfell Tower on Monday. Met Police Commander Stuart Cundy said there had been a total of 87 recoveries but, due to the ""catastrophic damage"" inside, that did not mean 87 people. So far, 21 people have been formally identified and their families informed. The taskforce is to take over the housing department, as well as other council operations. Communities Secretary Sajid Javid said: ""The challenge of providing that support is, and will continue to be, significant. I want to help the council meet that challenge. "" Councillor Elizabeth Campbell, who was chosen as Kensington and Chelsea Council's new leader on Monday said: ""The unprecedented scale of this incident makes it impossible for one organisation to cope on its own. That's why my first action as leader was to ask the Department for Communities and Local Government for help. ""I look forward to working with their staff as we all concentrate our efforts on healing the wounds in the north of our borough and to regain the trust of a community traumatised by disaster."" BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith said it was not yet clear who would be on the taskforce - but a statement from DCLG said the detail would be confirmed in the ""following few weeks"". Eleanor Kelly, chief executive of Southwark Council and spokeswoman for the Grenfell Response Team, said the team would be ""very welcome"". She told BBC Radio London: ""We can't stay in a crisis mode for an extended period of time because everybody needs to actually feel that things have gone back to a level of stability [and] a level of control."" London Mayor Sadiq Khan said putting the taskforce in place was the ""absolute minimum"" the government should do, but called for external commissioners to take charge of the council until elections next year. Meanwhile, the government has said 190 buildings in England that underwent fire tests on their cladding have failed, the government.  It also announced that cladding from one building had passed the test - the only sample to do so to date. The news about the taskforce comes after a tense three-hour meeting on Tuesday between survivors, Cdr Cundy and Westminster coroner Dr Fiona Wilcox. This video can not be played Sid-Ali Atmani and daughter Hayam lived on the 15th floor in Grenfell Tower Survivors were reportedly angry as they asked for information about people who were still missing. However, they were told the ""recovery phase"" could last until the end of the year, as Dr Wilcox described the inside of the tower as ""apocalyptic"". Grenfell scenes 'apocalyptic' - coroner Police also faced questions at the meeting as to why there had not been any arrests. Cdr Cundy warned it may never be possible to identify all the victims. ""Such is the devastation caused by the fire it may be that tragically we cannot find or identify all those who lost their lives,"" he said. Police again appealed for the public to come forward to ensure there are no ""hidden victims"" from the fire. It could be months until the final death toll is known, police have warned The taskforce announcement came on the same day as the government-set deadline to find temporary accommodation for all those made homeless by the fire. The Grenfell Response Team says 139 formal offers of housing have been made to survivors, after the prime minister promised housing would be offered to those in need by Wednesday. Housing Minister Alok Sharma told the Commons the temporary homes were in Kensington & Chelsea or neighbouring boroughs and being offered on a rent-free basis - but no-one will be ""forced into a home they do not want to move to"". A spokesman for North Kensington Law Centre - which represents more than 100 Grenfell victims - said many of the offers had been unsuitable. Father-of-two Mahad Egal escaped the fire with his family from their fourth floor flat and is now staying with friends, as the hotel room he was given was ""too small"" for four people. He has been offered a property but it is in a different borough and is bigger than his flat in Grenfell, which he worries will lead to higher rent costs. This video can not be played Grenfell Tower survivor Antonio is living in a hotel and has turned down two flats. Robert Atkinson, leader of the Labour Party at Kensington and Chelsea Council, said decisions about accommodation should be taken by survivors when they are ready - and not just to meet government deadlines. ""I want these arrangements to be made in the timescale and at the pace at which the victims and survivors wish to make these decisions."" Shadow housing secretary John Healey said the government has been ""off the pace at each stage following this terrible tragedy"" and the latest statement on the numbers rehoused show ""that in some ways it still is"".

"The four foreign ministers held talks in Cairo Restrictions on Qatar will continue after it rejected the ultimatum made by its Middle East neighbours, Saudi Arabia has said. The foreign ministers of four Arab countries, meeting in Cairo, said they regretted Qatar's ""negative"" response to their list of demands. Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Bahrain and the UAE severed ties with Qatar last month. They accuse it of supporting jihadi groups, and called for major changes in its policies. The diplomats said Qatar lacked ""understanding of the seriousness and gravity of the situation"". This video can not be played ""We're doing this to help Qatar,"" said Saudi FM Adel bin Ahmed al-Jubeir The Saudi foreign minister said further steps would be taken against Qatar at the appropriate time, and would be in line with international law. ""We're not doing this because we want to hurt Qatar, we're doing this to help Qatar,"" Adel bin Ahmed al-Jubeir said. Why the West should be worried What's behind crisis with Qatar? The meeting came as the deadline for Qatar to accept the list of demands or face further sanctions expired. The bloc's demands to Qatar include shutting down the Al Jazeera channel and scaling down ties with Iran, as well as handing over individuals wanted for terrorism and aligning itself politically and economically Gulf Co-operation Council (GCC). This video can not be played Al Jazeera journalists ""demand press freedom"" Speaking in London before the four ministers' statement, the Qatari Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani described the cutting of ties with his country as ""a siege that is a clear aggression and an insult"". ""The answer to our disagreement is not blockades and ultimatums, it is dialogue and reason,"" he added. The small oil- and gas-rich nation is dependent on imports to meet the basic needs of its population of 2.7 million. As its only land border is now closed, food is having to be shipped or flown in. Mr Thani said this could be sustained ""indefinitely"". The window for dialogue to resolve this dispute is not yet completely shut but it is fast heading that way. Qatar has refused to comply with the 13 demands made by the Saudi-led quartet, so now the ball is in their court. They have three possible courses of action: Drop the sanctions against Qatar. This would be a massive climbdown and Arab ministers have already said the sanctions stay, for now. Increase the sanctions. This is quite likely, if only to save face. They could include financial restrictions on flows of Qatari money. Military action would be a disastrous last resort but another worrying possibility hinted at by UAE spokesmen is secondary sanctions: forcing countries to choose between doing business with the Saudi-led quartet or with Qatar. Do nothing, but keep sanctions in place. Although painful for Qatar, and harmful to the wider GCC, this would at least allow a cooling-off period after which some kind of compromise may be possible. 5 June:A number of Arab countries including Saudi Arabia and Egypt cut diplomatic ties with Qatar, accusing it of destabilising the region. Measures include closing airspace to Qatar Airways 8 June:Qatarvows it will ""not surrender""the independence of its foreign policy amid US calls for Gulf unity 23 June:Qatar isgiven 10 days to comply with a 13-point list of demands, including shutting down the Al Jazeera news network, closing a Turkish military base, cutting ties with the Muslim Brotherhood, and curbing diplomatic relations with Iran 1 July:Qatar's foreign minister says the state has rejected the demands, but is ready to engage in dialogue under the right conditions 3 July:Saudi Arabia and its allies extend by 48 hours the deadline for Qatar to accept their list of demands Al Jazeera's press freedom call.

"This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: I hope the prime minister is proud of her record Jeremy Corbyn has accused the government of ""flip flopping and floundering"" over public sector pay. During PMQs, the Labour leader said that through the 1% pay cap the government was ""recklessly exploiting the goodwill of public servants"" and called for it to be scrapped. Theresa May said the government would study pay review recommendations ""very carefully"" when they are made. And she said Labour would ""bankrupt our country"" if Mr Corbyn became PM. BBC Political Live: Rolling updates Kuenssberg: Will cap be lifted? Several ministers have suggested they want the public sector pay cap, introduced in 2013 following a two-year pay freeze, to be lifted, and some Conservative MPs have called for a change of direction after the Tories lost their majority in the general election. Mr Corbyn focused on the subject during Prime Minister's Questions in the Commons, saying there was a ""low pay epidemic"" in the UK, and that pay levels were causing a ""real shortage"" of NHS staff. In a reference to the Conservatives' deal with the Democratic Unionists, he said: ""The prime minister found Â£1bn to keep her own job - why can't she find the same amount of money to keep nurses and teachers in their own job - who after all serve all of us."" Mrs May said she valued public sector workers' ""incredibly important work"", adding: ""I understand why people feel strongly about the issue of their pay.""

""Waiting to put up taxes, waiting to destroy jobs, waiting to bankrupt our country. We will never let it happen."" Labour continued the pressure on the pay cap after PMQs, tabling an urgent question in the Commons. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell compared cabinet ministers to children ""scrapping in the school playground"" over what should happen to the policy. Chief Secretary to the Treasury Liz Truss said the cap remained in place ""because it is the responsible thing to do"". Earlier one union described the 1% cap as ""dead in the water"" after receiving an offer of a 2% increase for its workers. Nonetheless, the Fire Brigades Union (FBU) said the offer was ""simply not good enough"". ""It does not recognise the extra work firefighters have been doing, it fails to address their falling living standards and, despite hints at improvements, does not make clear what they will be earning in future years,"" said FBU general secretary Matt Wrack. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Transport Secretary Chris Grayling rejected the suggestion the offer to firefighters had ""busted"" the 1% cap, saying they were the responsibility of local authorities rather than central government. The wages of public servants the government is responsible for ""will be a matter that's addressed in future Budgets"", he said. The Fire Brigades' Union has criticised the 2% offer but says it shows the cap is ""dead in the water"" Most public sector workers' wages are set by ministers after receiving recommendations by independent pay review bodies, which are delivered at different points in the year. Teachers and police are expecting a government response to their pay bodies' recommendations later this month. Downing Street has insisted the policy has not changed, with Chancellor Philip Hammond urging ministers to ""hold their nerve"". Asked about the debate within government, Mr Grayling said: ""There is always going to be a debate around the cabinet table about what to do - and we are not all clones - but the bottom line is that we are a team."" Some ministers have called for the 1% pay cap to be scrapped Speaking on BBC Radio 5 live, former Conservative Party chairman Lord Patten called on Theresa May to tell ""others who've got their own opinion to shut up"". ""There is a sense you have at the moment of everybody doing their own thing,"" he said. ""Nobody actually asserting very clearly what they want to do in the national interest. ""We can't go on living from hand-to-mouth in this sort of shambolic way."" Meanwhile the FDA union, which represents senior civil servants, has written to Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson along with other cabinet ministers who have indicated they support easing pay restraint, calling on them to follow up their ""warm words"" with action. ""Each of these ministers will have sign off on the pay settlement for their staff this year. They cannot hide behind pay review bodies with restricted remits. Failure to act will demonstrate these warm words were little more than meaningless platitudes,"" said general secretary Dave Penman. The Institute for Fiscal Studies has said increasing pay in line with inflation next year - rather than 1% - could cost about Â£5bn. Speaking at a conference in South Korea on Tuesday, former prime minister David Cameron said people calling for an end to austerity were ""selfish"". ""The opponents of so-called austerity couch their arguments in a way that make them sound generous and compassionate,"" he said. ""They seek to paint the supporters of sound finances as selfish, or uncaring. The exact reverse is true. ""Giving up on sound finances isn't being generous, it's being selfish: spending money today that you may need tomorrow."" Decisions on public sector pay are taken by the government after receiving recommendations from independent 'pay review bodies' There are eight of these, which each make their own recommendations for different sectors of the 5.4m public sector workforce In reaching a recommendation they have to consider the need to ""recruit, retain and motivate"" staff They also need to consider the ""financial circumstances"" of the government Since the 2010 Budget, it has been government policy for public sector pay to be frozen or, more recently, capped at 1% Pay review bodies are able to recommend higher increases despite this policy, although the former chairman of several bodies, Alasdair Smith, told the BBC to do so would be a ""big step"" Civil servants have also been subject to the 1% cap, although they are not covered by pay review bodies Individual government departments have responsibility for implementing pay policy following guidelines set by the Treasury Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser At least two killed and 1,000 structures destroyed as wildfires rage in Los Angeles Watch: Ferocious and explosive fire burns behind CBS reporter Liam Payne cause of death confirmed as UK inquest opens Where is Greenland and why does Trump want it?

"Carmaker Volvo has said all new models will have an electric motor from 2019. The Chinese-owned firm, best known for its emphasis on driver safety, has become the first traditional carmaker to signal the end of the internal combustion engine. It plans to launch five fully electric models between 2019 and 2021 and a range of hybrid models. But it will still be manufacturing earlier models that have pure combustion engines. Geely, Volvo's Chinese owner, has been quietly pushing ahead with electric car development for more than a decade. It now aims to sell one million electric cars by 2025. How electric is Volvo's future? Tesla shares boost Can China's electric cars kill off petrol? ""This announcement marks the end of the solely combustion engine-powered car,"" said Hakan Samuelsson, chief executive of Volvo's carmaking division. ""People increasingly demand electrified cars, and we want to respond to our customers' current and future needs,"" he said. Volvo's announcement sounds dramatic, but the reality is it simply reflects the direction much of the auto industry is travelling in. The internal combustion engine is not dead - and won't be for a while at least. It still offers a relatively cheap and well-proven means of getting around. The problem is that emissions regulations are getting much tighter. From 2021, for example, carmakers in the EU will have to ensure that across their fleets, average CO2 output is no higher than 95g of CO2 per kilometre. That's a lot lower than current levels. Carmakers are reacting by developing fully-electric models. Some are already pretty impressive. But developing mass market cars that are affordable and have the right levels of performance is a research-intensive and expensive process, while persuading consumers to buy them in large numbers may also be time consuming. In the meantime, hybridisation - fitting electric motors to cars which also have conventional engines - offers a convenient way to bring down emissions without harming performance. And there are plenty of different kinds of hybrid systems to choose from. Volvo is making headlines, but other manufacturers are doing much the same kind of thing. Tim Urquhart, principal analyst at IHS Automotive, said the move was a ""clever sort of PR coup - it is a headline grabber"". ""It is not something that moves the goalposts hugely,"" he said. ""Cars launched before that date [of 2019] will still have traditional combustion engines. ""The announcement is significant, and quite impressive, but only in a small way."" It comes after US-based electric car firm Tesla announced on Sunday that it will start deliveries of its first mass-market car, the Model 3, at the end of the month. Elon Musk, Tesla's founder, said the company was on track to make 20,000 Model 3 cars a month by December. His company's rise has upset the traditional power balance of the US car industry. Tesla, which makes no profits, now has a stock market value of $58bn, nearly one-quarter higher than that of Ford, one of the Detroit giants that has dominated the automotive scene for more than a century.

"This video can not be played Lord Hodge dismisses the appeal against HMRC The Supreme Court has ruled in favour of HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) in its fight with Rangers over the club's use of Employee Benefit Trusts (EBTs). More than Â£47m was paid to players, managers and directors between 2001 and 2010 in tax-free loans. However, HMRC argued the payments were earnings and should be taxable. The court's decision is not expected to have any material or financial impact on Rangers now as the club is owned by a different company. Rangers' use of EBTs and the subsequent appeals by HMRC became known as the ""big tax case"". Who were the EBT beneficiaries? Two tribunals in 2012 and 2014 had previously found in Rangers' favour, but the Court of Session found in favour of HMRC after an appeal in 2015. Liquidators BDO were then allowed to appeal to the Supreme Court in London as the ruling has implications for future cases. On Wednesday, the Supreme Court unanimously dismissed RFC's appeal and ruled in favour of HMRC. There will undoubtedly be calls for the football authorities to act following this judgement. A Scottish Premier League investigation headed by Lord Nimmo Smith found Rangers guilty of not registering players properly and the company was fined in 2013. Nimmo Smith's judgement was made at a time when the EBT scheme was deemed acceptable by a tax tribunal and he resisted calls for the club to be stripped of honours won during the years the scheme was in operation, saying ""Rangers FC did not gain any unfair competitive advantage from the contraventions of the SPL Rules."" It's unlikely the football authorities will have much appetite to sanction another investigation but that won't stop some calling for just that. A spokesman said the Scottish Premier Football League will ""take time to examine the âjudgement in detail and to consider any implications."" What does the ruling mean? The result is a major victory for HMRC in its attempts to recoup tax from thousands of other companies which ran EBTs and similar schemes, which were the subject of a crackdown in legislation enacted in December 2010. HMRC could now issue ""follower notices"", which would demand payment from companies who ran similar schemes. A number of football clubs in England fall into this category. A settlement opportunity in light of the 2010 legislation ran out in July 2015 and other firms could now be liable for major sums. In a written judgment, the judges said: ""The sums paid to the trustee of the Principal Trust for a footballer constituted the footballer's earnings. The risk that the trustee might not set up a sub-trust or give a loan of the sub-trust funds to the footballer does not alter the nature of the payments made to the trustee of the Principal Trust. ""The discretionary bonuses made available to RFC's employees through the same trust mechanisms also fall within the tax charge as these were given in respect of the employee's work. ""Payment to the Principal Trust should have been subject to deduction of income tax under the PAYE regulations."" Sir David Murray took control of Rangers in 1988 and sold the club in 2011 The EBT scheme was administered by the Murray Group, then majority shareholder of the Glasgow club, from 2001 to 2009. In February 2012, Rangers, which was then run by Craig Whyte, went into administration over a separate tax debt and the tax authority rejected a creditors agreement in June of that year. The supreme court decision is in relation to Murray Group companies, including the liquidated company RFC 2012, and not the current owners at Ibrox. The result will mean the creditors of RFC 2012 will receive less money from the pot collected by liquidators BDO, as HMRC will now be owed more money. Former Rangers chairman Sir David Murray said he was ""hugely disappointed"" with the verdict, which he said ran counter to the legal advice which was consistently provided to Rangers Football Club. He said: ""It should be emphasised that there have been no allegations made by HMRC or any of the courts that the club was involved in tax evasion, which is a criminal offence. ""The decision will be greeted with dismay by the ordinary creditors of the club, many of which are small businesses, who will now receive a much lower distribution in the liquidation of the club, which occurred during the ownership of Craig Whyte, than may otherwise have been the case."" In a statement, HMRC said: ""This decision has wide-ranging implications for other avoidance cases and we encourage anyone who has tried to avoid tax on their earnings to now agree with us the tax owed. ""HMRC will always challenge contrived arrangements that try to deliver tax advantages never intended by parliament."" Rangers liquidators BDO said it believed taking the case to the Supreme Court had been the correct course of action ""given the significance of the matter"". It said: ""We will now engage with HMRC on adjudicating its claim. ""Further advice and guidance will be provided to creditors in due course."" The Scottish FA said that, after examining the judgement, it would take no further disciplinary action. It said it had been advised it was unlikely the Scottish FA would be successful pursuing a complaint about whether disciplinary rules could have been breached. It added that, even if successful, any sanctions available to a judicial panel would be limited in their scope. Meanwhile, Celtic said they were sure that the football authorities would review their findings that Rangers gained no sporting advantage from the tax-avoidance scheme. A  league commission fined Rangers in 2013 but did not strip the club of any titles they had won during the years the scheme was in operation. Celtic disagreed with that ruling at the time, and said the Supreme Court judgement ""re-affirms that view.""

"This video can not be played Bijan Ebrahimi was considered an ""attention seeker"" - he was told to ""shut up"" by a police officer A disabled Iranian refugee repeatedly reported death threats and racial abuse to police for seven years before being brutally murdered,a report has found,external. Bijan Ebrahimi was beaten to death and set alight on a Bristol estate amid false claims he was a paedophile. The IPCC said he had been treated ""consistently differently from his neighbours"" in what could be ""racial bias, conscious or unconscious"". Avon and Somerset's police chief said ""we failed him in his hour of need"". Mr Ebrahimi's sisters, Mojgan Kahayatian and Manisha Moores, said the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) report showed ""how terrible a life he had during those last few years"". Mr Ebrahimi waskilled by his neighbour Lee Jamesin Brislington in July 2013. Bijan Ebrahimi was brutally murdered outside his flat in Brislington in July 2013 Three days before his death, police arrested Mr Ebrahimi following complaints he had taken pictures of children near his home. However nothing suspicious was found and he was released without charge. These false allegations led to what Mr Justice Simon called during James's sentencing ""a vigilante crime"" and ""an act of murderous injustice"". During the fatal attack, James repeatedly stamped on the victim's head shouting ""have some of that"". Evidence gathered by the IPCC uncovered ""poor responses"" by police for at least seven years before the murder and repeated failures to protect him or record crimes against him. Lee James, right, set Bijan Ebrahimi on fire. Stephen Norley, left, admitted helping In 73 of the calls Mr Ebrahimi made between 2007 and 2013, he reported incidents of racial abuse, criminal damage and threats to kill. But police failed to record crimes on at least 40 occasions, the watchdog said. The report also found there was ""consistent systematic failure"" by call handlers, who breached standards on recording crimes, identifying hate offences and repeat victims. IPCC commissioner Jan Williams said: ""Bijan Ebrahimi self-identified as a victim of race hate crime, but was never recognised as a repeat victim of abuse who needed help. ""Instead, his complaints about abusive neighbours were disbelieved and he was considered to be a liar, a nuisance and an attention seeker."" His sister Mojgan said the family had been ""devastated"" by his death and the police had ""failed"" him. ""It was so hard to see Bijan all these years suffering and his voice never listened to,"" she said. ""He was always waiting on police, he was thinking it's their duty to care for him and protect him so he didn't think it was up to us. ""He never gave up and he always thought he was in a country that police was there to protect people and he couldn't see anything beyond that."" Reports Mr Ebrahimi made to police Bijan Ebrahimi was murdered near his home in Brislington, Bristol 2007 - 9 reports made, the number recorded as a crime is unknown 2008 - 21 reports, 7 recorded as a crime 2009 - 18 reports, 8 recorded as a crime 2010 - 11 reports, 3 recorded as a crime 2011 - 5 reports, 4 recorded as a crime 2012 - 7 reports, 3 recorded as a crime 2013 - 2 reports, 0 recorded as a crime Ms Williams said police accepted the neighbours' versions of events at face value and viewed Mr Ebrahimi as the culprit rather than the victim. She described Mr Ebrahimi's faith in the force despite their repeated rejection of his version of events, as a ""sad, poignant fact"". The commissioner added: ""We found evidence that Bijan Ebrahimi had been treated consistently differently from his neighbours, to his detriment and without reasonable explanation. ""Some of the evidence has the hallmarks of what could be construed as racial bias, conscious or unconscious."" PC Kevin Duffy and PCSO Andrew Passmore were convicted of misconduct and jailed PC Kevin Duffy and PCSO Andrew Passmore were jailed last year for misconduct over their dealings with Mr Ebrahimi. They and two other police officers were also dismissed from the force. Chief Constable Andy Marsh said: ""We failed [Mr Ebrahimi] in his hour of need and I am unreservedly sorry for the pain his family have suffered in the last four years. ""Some of these failings were systematic but it's important to acknowledge that the actions of a very small number of individuals had a catastrophic effect."" Bristol's elected mayor, Marvin Rees said this was ""a horrific case which highlighted the need for many things to change"". He said the city council is ""very sorry for any shortcomings that are identified"". Mr Rees added he had been assured the council's current practice ""meets the needs of vulnerable people"" and that the authority would be looking ""very closely"" at the IPCC report. Timeline of Ebrahimi case 16 July 2013 - Bijan Ebrahimi is found ""in flames"" at a property in Brislington. The case is referred to the IPCC 19 September 2013 - The IPCC serves notices of gross misconduct against six police officers 28 November 2013 - Lee James is jailed for life for Mr Ebrahimi's murder. Stephen Norley is sentenced to four years for assisting him 21 December 2015 - Kevin Duffy and Andrew Passmore are convicted of misconduct in public office 22 January 2015 - The pair are dismissed from the force 9 February 2016 - Duffy is jailed for 10 months and Passmore for four 3 May 2016 - PCs Helen Harris and Leanne Winter are dismissed from the force This video can not be played Force working to deal with 'unconscious bias' Avon and Somerset Police has since implemented changes across its systems relating to culture, anti-social behaviour and vulnerability. Police and Crime Commissioner Sue Mountstevens said: ""There is nothing that can do justice to the collective failure to protect Mr Ebrahimi and to treat him as a victim of hate crime.

"This video can not be played Missiles fired during US-South Korea drills serve as warning to North Korea The US and South Korea have held a ballistic missile drill, after North Korea tested a long-range missile experts believe may reach Alaska. Self-restraint was ""all that separated armistice and war"" and could be changed at any time, the two allies said. It would be a ""grave mistake"" for the North to think otherwise, they said. China and Russia have urged both sides to stop flexing their military muscle and said they opposed any attempts at regime change in North Korea. Meanwhile US President Donald Trump questioned Beijing's commitment to countering North Korea's nuclear threat,apparently citing,externalChina's first-quarter trade figures. ""Trade between China and North Korea grew almost 40 pct in the first quarter. So much for China working with us - but we had to give it a try!"" hetweeted,external. The missile launch, the latest in a series of tests, was in defiance of a ban by the United Nations Security Council (UNSC). The US has asked for an urgent meeting of the UNSC to discuss the issue. A closed-door session of the 15-member body will take place later on Wednesday. Pyongyang claimed on Tuesday to have successfully tested an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM). However, most experts believe that the North does not yet have long-range nuclear weapon capabilities. The two Koreas are technically still at war as the 1950-1953 Korean War ended in an armistice. The allies conducted a ballistic missile fire exercise in the Sea of Japan. South Korean President Moon Jae-in said the allies needed to demonstrate their missile defence posture ""with action, not just a statement"", his office said. Is the new missile test a game-changer? Can the US defend itself against North Korea? Have North Korea's missile tests paid off? What can the outside world do? Meanwhile, a joint statement by Gen Vincent Brooks, commander of US forces Korea, and South Korean Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen Lee Sun-jin said the allies were maintaining patience and self-restraint, but this could change. ""We are able to change our choice when so ordered by our alliance's national leaders. It would be a grave mistake for anyone to believe anything to the contrary,"" it said. Earlier, US Secretary of StateRex Tillerson called North Korea's move,externala ""new escalation of the threat"" and warned that Washington ""will never accept a nuclear-armed North Korea"". Mr Tillerson said ""global action is required to stop a global threat"" and warned that any nation that provided economic or military benefits to the North, or failed to fully implement UN Security Council resolutions, was ""aiding and abetting a dangerous regime"". A long-range missile usually designed to carry a nuclear warhead The minimum range is 5,500km (3,400 miles), although most fly about 10,000km or more Pyongyang has previously displayed two types of ICBMs: the KN-08, with a range of 11,500km, and the KN-14, with a range of 10,000km, but before 4 July had not claimed to have flight tested an ICBM. It is not clear what differentiates the Hwasong-14 North Korea's missile programme State news agency KCNA quoted leader Kim Jong-un as saying the test was a ""gift"" to the Americans on their independence day. The report warned of the possibility of more tests, saying he ordered officials to ""frequently send big and small 'gift packages' to the Yankees"". This video can not be played ""One expert says the missile could reach Alaska"" Pyongyang said earlier the Hwasong-14 intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) had reached an altitude of 2,802km (1,731 miles) and flew 933km for 39 minutes before hitting a target in the sea. North Korea, it said, was now ""a full-fledged nuclear power that has been possessed of the most powerful inter-continental ballistic rocket capable of hitting any part of the world"". Some experts believe that Tuesday's test proves that it has a missile that could travel across the globe and reach Alaska. Physicist David Wright said it couldreach a maximum range of about 6,700km,externalon a standard trajectory, while South Korea's defence ministry on Wednesday put the range between 7,000 and 8,000km. This video can not be played North Korean state TV announces ""successful"" missile test But whether that missile could deliver a warhead is still a question. Pyongyang claimed the rocket carried a ""heavy warhead"" and that it ""accurately hit the targeted waters without any structural breakdown"". South Korea said there was no evidence proving the missile could withstand high temperatures and successfully re-enter the atmosphere,reported Yonhap news agency.,external Experts believe Pyongyang does not yet have the capability to miniaturise a nuclear warhead, fit it onto a long-range missile, and ensure it is protected until delivery to the target. They say many of North Korea's missiles cannot accurately hit targets. Butothers believe that,externalat the rate it is going, Pyongyang may overcome these challenges and develop a nuclear weapon that could strike the US within five to 10 years. How advanced is North Korea's nuclear programme? North Korean media released this image of Tuesday's missile launch By bringing Alaska within range, the new missile test is an unambiguous game-changer in both symbolical and practical terms. US territory (albeit separate from the contiguous continental US) is now finally within Pyongyang's cross-hairs. For the first time a US president has to accept that the North poses a ""real and present"" danger not merely to north-east Asia and America's key allies - but to the US proper. President Trump's weakness lies in having overplayed his hand too publicly and too loudly. Read more from Dr Nilsson-Wright. Japan on Tuesday said ""repeated provocations like this are absolutely unacceptable"" and lodged a protest. Meanwhile China - who is Pyongyang's main economic ally - and Russia have called on North Korea to suspend its ballistic missile programme in exchange for a halt on the large-scale military exercises by the US and South Korea. Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin, who met in Moscow on Tuesday, said ""the opposing sides should start negotiations"". On Wednesday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov added that the two countries opposed any attempts to resolve the crisis by force. ""The task of the denuclearisation of the entire Korean peninsula cannot and should not be used as a disguise for attempts to change North Korea's regime. This is our common position,"" he said.

"Charlie Gard has been in intensive care since October It is impossible for terminally ill Charlie Gard to be transferred to the Vatican's children's hospital for treatment, Boris Johnson has said. The foreign secretary told Italian Foreign Minister Angelino Alfano legal reasons prevented him from being moved. The president of the Bambino Gesu hospital in Rome had asked British doctors if 10-month-old Charlie could be transferred to his care. It comes after the Popetweeted his support for Charlie on Monday. Charlie has been receiving specialist treatment at Great Ormond Street Hospital since October. Mr Johnson has told his Italian counterpart it is ""right that decisions continued to be led by expert medical opinion, supported  by the courts"", in line with Charlie's ""best interests."" Charlie has mitochondrial depletion syndrome, a rare genetic condition which causes progressive muscle weakness. Doctors say he cannot see, hear, move, cry or swallow. During questions to the prime minister, on Wednesday,external, Theresa May said she was ""confident"" Great Ormond Street Hospital ""have, and always will, consider any offers or new information that has come forward with consideration of the well-being of a desperately ill child"". Connie Yates and Chris Gard raised more than Â£1.3m for experimental treatment for Charlie Charlie's parents raised Â£1.3m on a crowdfunding site to pay for experimental treatment in the US. But they lost a legal battle with the hospital last month after judges at the European Court of Human Rights concluding further treatment would ""continue to cause Charlie significant harm"". The Vatican's paediatric hospital stepped in after Pope Francis called for Charlie's parents, Chris Gard and Connie Yates, to be allowed to ""accompany and treat their child until the end"". The hospital's president Mariella Enoc said: ""I was contacted by the mother, who is a very determined and decisive person and doesn't want to be stopped by anything."" Renowned scientist and genetics expert Robert Winston told ITV's Good Morning Britain that courts and doctors should not be interfering with the parents' wishes, saying the loss of a child was ""about the worst injury that any person can have"". However, he said ""interferences from the Vatican and from Donald Trump"" were ""extremely unhelpful and very cruel"". Lord Winston added: ""This child has been dealt with at a hospital which has huge expertise in mitochondrial disease and is being offered a break in a hospital that has never published anything on this disease, as far as I'm aware."" Lord Winston said ""interferences from the Vatican"" were ""unhelpful"" The Vatican said the Pope was following the case ""with affection and sadness"". A statement added: ""For [Charlie's parents] he prays, hoping that their desire to accompany and care for their own child to the end is not ignored."" US President Donald Trump also tweeted about Charlie on Monday, writing: ""If we can help little #CharlieGard, as per our friends in the UK and the Pope, we would be delighted to do so.""

"The Saudi Arabian embassy in London says Saudi itself has been subject to attacks by al-Qaeda and so-called Islamic State Saudi Arabia is the chief foreign promoter of Islamist extremism in the UK, a new report has claimed. The Henry Jackson Society said there was a ""clear and growing link"" between Islamist organisations in receipt of overseas funds, hate preachers and Jihadist groups promoting violence. The foreign affairs think tank called for a public inquiry into the role of Saudi Arabia and other Gulf nations. The Saudi embassy in London says the claims are ""categorically false"". Meanwhile, ministers are under pressure to publish their own report on UK-based Islamist groups. The Home Office report into the existence and influence of Jihadist organisations, commissioned by former Prime Minister David Cameron in 2015, has reportedly yet to be completed amid questions as to whether it will ever be published. Qatar crisis: After the deadline, what next? May defends UK ties with Saudi Arabia Reality Check: Why does the Prevent strategy divide opinion? Critics have suggested it could make uncomfortable reading for the government, which has close and longstanding diplomatic, security and economic links with the Gulf, particularly Saudi Arabia. BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner said he understood the report was ""largely finished and sitting on Theresa May's desk"", but there was probably a reluctance to publish it because of ""embarrassing"" content. The Henry Jackson Society is a foreign policy think tank that advocates the robust spreading of liberal democracy, the rule of law and the market economy. Their report says a number of Gulf nations, as well as Iran, are providing financial support to mosques and Islamic educational institutions which have played host to extremist preachers and been linked to the spread of extremist material. At the top of the list, the report claims, is Saudi Arabia, the UK's closest ally in the Middle East and biggest trading partner. It alleges individuals and foundations have been heavily involved in exporting what it calls ""an illiberal, bigoted Wahhabi ideology"", quoting a number of examples. In a minority of cases, the report alleges institutions in the UK that receive Saudi funding are run directly from Saudi Arabia, although in most instances the money appears to ""simply buy foreign donors' influence"". Why the UK is so close to Saudi Arabia By BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner Britain has a close, long-standing and sometimes controversial relationship with Saudi Arabia, birthplace of Islam and today the world's biggest oil producer and exporter. Annual bilateral trade is worth billions of pounds, UK exports to Saudi Arabia, notably in defence, employ thousands of people in both countries, and there is close co-operation on counter-terrorism. But UK and US-supplied warplanes and munitions are being used by the Royal Saudi Air Force to bomb targets in Yemen, sometimes resulting in civilian casualties. Saudi Arabia also has a much-criticised human rights record. This has prompted calls from some, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, for an arms embargo on Saudi Arabia. But Theresa May has spoken of the economic and security benefits of this alliance and has pushed for closer ties with Britain's Gulf Arab partners. In a statement, the Saudi embassy in London said any accusations that the kingdom had radicalised ""a small number of individuals are baseless and lack credible evidence"". And it pointed out that the country has itself been subject to numerous attacks by al-Qaeda and so-called Islamic State. It added: ""We do not and will not condone the actions or ideology of violent extremism and we will not rest until these deviants and their organisations are destroyed."" The Home Office said it was determined to cut off the funding of extremism but it declined to comment on the think tank's report. The BBC's Frank Gardner said the report's release comes at a sensitive time with Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and Egypt all accusing Qatar of supporting extremism - a charge the report says is hypocritical. The think tank also accuses Qatar of links to terrorism, which it denies. Arab foreign ministers are meeting in Cairo on Wednesday to discuss possible further sanctions on Qatar, while the Qatari foreign minister will be making his own country's case at a press conference in London. Endorsing the report, Labour MP Dan Jarvis said it shed light on ""very worrying"" links between Saudi Arabia and the funding of extremism and he called for the government to release its report on foreign funding. ""In the wake of the terrible and tragic terrorist attacks we have seen this year, it is vital that we use every tool at our disposal to protect our communities,"" he said. ""This includes identifying the networks that promote and support extremism and shutting down the financial networks that fund it."" Is Saudi Arabia to blame for IS? Saudi Arabia profile He said the proposed Commission for Countering Extremism, a new body intended to expose examples of extremism in civil society, should make the foreign funding of UK institutions a priority. Prime Minister Theresa May, who visited Saudi Arabia in April, has insisted the UK's historic relationship with the desert kingdom is important for British security and trade. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has called for the immediate suspension of UK arms exports to Saudi Arabia because of its human rights record and involvement in military action in Yemen.

"Carmaker Volvo has said all new models will have an electric motor from 2019. The Chinese-owned firm, best known for its emphasis on driver safety, has become the first traditional carmaker to signal the end of the internal combustion engine. It plans to launch five fully electric models between 2019 and 2021 and a range of hybrid models. But it will still be manufacturing earlier models that have pure combustion engines. Geely, Volvo's Chinese owner, has been quietly pushing ahead with electric car development for more than a decade. It now aims to sell one million electric cars by 2025. How electric is Volvo's future? Tesla shares boost Can China's electric cars kill off petrol? ""This announcement marks the end of the solely combustion engine-powered car,"" said Hakan Samuelsson, chief executive of Volvo's carmaking division. ""People increasingly demand electrified cars, and we want to respond to our customers' current and future needs,"" he said. Volvo's announcement sounds dramatic, but the reality is it simply reflects the direction much of the auto industry is travelling in. The internal combustion engine is not dead - and won't be for a while at least. It still offers a relatively cheap and well-proven means of getting around. The problem is that emissions regulations are getting much tighter. From 2021, for example, carmakers in the EU will have to ensure that across their fleets, average CO2 output is no higher than 95g of CO2 per kilometre. That's a lot lower than current levels. Carmakers are reacting by developing fully-electric models. Some are already pretty impressive. But developing mass market cars that are affordable and have the right levels of performance is a research-intensive and expensive process, while persuading consumers to buy them in large numbers may also be time consuming. In the meantime, hybridisation - fitting electric motors to cars which also have conventional engines - offers a convenient way to bring down emissions without harming performance. And there are plenty of different kinds of hybrid systems to choose from. Volvo is making headlines, but other manufacturers are doing much the same kind of thing. Tim Urquhart, principal analyst at IHS Automotive, said the move was a ""clever sort of PR coup - it is a headline grabber"". ""It is not something that moves the goalposts hugely,"" he said. ""Cars launched before that date [of 2019] will still have traditional combustion engines. ""The announcement is significant, and quite impressive, but only in a small way."" It comes after US-based electric car firm Tesla announced on Sunday that it will start deliveries of its first mass-market car, the Model 3, at the end of the month. Elon Musk, Tesla's founder, said the company was on track to make 20,000 Model 3 cars a month by December. His company's rise has upset the traditional power balance of the US car industry. Tesla, which makes no profits, now has a stock market value of $58bn, nearly one-quarter higher than that of Ford, one of the Detroit giants that has dominated the automotive scene for more than a century.

"Mr Higgins made points about US national security during his video Officials at Auschwitz have criticised a US congressman for making and voicing a video inside a gas chamber at the former Nazi death camp.

Republican Clay Higgins said in thevideo,externalthat the horrors of the WW2 death camps were the reason why the US military should be ""invincible"". Some 1.1 million people, mainly Jews, died at the Nazi-occupied Poland camp. Mr Higgins made a five-minute video showing him in different parts of the museum talking about the atrocities in the death camp. At one point, he goes inside a gas chamber and explains how the victims were gassed. The museum posted a picture of the plaque outside the gas chamber building on Twitter ""This is why Homeland Security must be squared away, why our military must be invincible,"" he says. But the museum responded that it was inappropriate to speak inside the gas chambers. ""Everyone has the right to personal reflections. However, inside a former gas chamber, there should be mournful silence. It's not a stage,"" it tweeted on Tuesday.

"Abyss makes dolls for clients around the world, but does not release figures on how many it sells There should be a ban on the import of sex robots designed to look like children, the author of a new report into the phenomenon has said. Prof Noel Sharkey said that society as a whole needed to consider the impact of all types of sex robots. His Foundation for Responsible Robotics has conducted a consultation on the issue. Only a handful of companies were currently making sex robots, said Prof Sharkey. But, he added, the upcoming robot revolution could change that. The report, Our Sexual Future With Robots, was written to focus attention on an issue barely discussed at the moment, he said. The report acknowledged that finding out how many people actually owned such robots was difficult because the companies that made them did not release the numbers. But, said Prof Sharkey, it was time society woke up to a possible future where humans and robots had sex. ""We do need policymakers to look at it and the general public to decide what is acceptable and permissible,"" he said. ""We need to think as a society what we want to do about it. I don't know the answers - I am just asking the questions."" Companies making sex robots include Android Love Doll, Sex Bot and True Companion. Most have previously made realistic, silicone-skinned sex dolls and are now considering or starting to ship dolls that can move and speak. The most advanced of these is San Diego-based Abyss Creations, which ships a product known as Real Doll and is due to release a sex doll with artificial intelligence later this year.Called Harmony, the robot moves its head and eyes and speaks via a tablet-enabled app. The company has already released the app, which allows users to program moods and voices for an existing doll. The report considers a few options for how such robots could be employed as: robot ""prostitutes"", working in brothels sexual companions for the lonely or the elderly a new means of ""sexual healing"" a sexual therapy tool for rapists or paedophiles The last of these was the most problematic, said Prof Sharkey. This video can not be played Aimee Van Wynsberghe, co-director of the Foundation for Responsible Robotics on the pros and cons of sex robots Sex dolls that resemble children do exist, and a court in Canada is currently determining whether owning one is illegal. Newfoundland resident Kenneth Harrison ordered a doll from a Japanese business called Harumi Designs. The company is on a Canadian watch-list, and the doll was intercepted at the airport. Mr Harrison was charged with possessing child pornography but has pleaded not guilty. In Asia, there are already brothels that use adult sex dolls. And there are reports that a doll-maker operated one in Barcelona, although this has not been verified. The report examines the nature of a human-robot relationship, but would women want a male sex robot? Dr Kathleen Richardson, a robot ethicist at De Montfort University, agreed with the report authors that child sex robots should be banned but stopped short of calling for a ban on all such sex dolls. ""The real problem here is not the dolls but the commercial sex trade. Sex robots are just another type of pornography,"" she said. She believes such robots would inevitably ""increase social isolation"". She also criticises the report for what she said is a failure to address the issue of gender. ""Why does the report have a picture of a male robot on the cover when we know that the doll market - which is driving this - is mainly female dolls? ""It is perpetrating the idea that this is gender-neutral, but the truth is that there are not many women buying such dolls, it is largely driven by men and male ideas of sexuality."" Prof Sharkey said that there was currently a mismatch between what those selling such dolls wanted their customers to believe about the dolls and the reality of what they offered. ""The manufacturers of sex robots want to create an experience as close to a human sexual encounter as possible,"" he said. ""But robots cannot feel love, tenderness or form emotional bonds. The best that robots can do is to fake it."" A sex doll that can talk Experts debate the rise of love droids Call for a ban on sex robots What is like in a sex robot factory? Sex robots are a relatively new phenomenon and an obvious next stage for sex dolls, which have become increasingly sophisticated in recent years. Most have silicone skin, articulated metal skeletons and realistic features such as hair and eyes. In the main, these dolls are designed in female form, although Sinthetics has had some commercial success with its male sex dolls. But Prof Sharkey has doubts about how human-like such dolls will become. ""I can't see them as being like humans in the next 50 years. They will always be slightly spooky, and their conversation skills now are awful,"" he said. Dr Richardson also questioned whether such robots would become mainstream or even be possible technologically. ""The report assumes that you can create a functioning robot that can respond to humans, but in fact it is incredibly complex,"" she said One of this year's big TV series - Westworld - explored the idea of people paying to have sex with human-like robots Robots gear up for sex and love The sex doll that engages in small talk At least two killed and 1,000 structures destroyed as wildfires rage in Los Angeles Watch: Ferocious and explosive fire burns behind CBS reporter Liam Payne cause of death confirmed as UK inquest opens Where is Greenland and why does Trump want it?

"Georgia took part in a campaign as a child to show life is not restricted by diabetes Imagine having to inject yourself thousands of times over the course of your lifetime, but never talking about it to anyone. Many people live with hidden disabilities - conditions which don't have physical signs but are painful, exhausting and isolating. Sympathy and understanding from others can often be in short supply. Simon Magnus, Georgia Macqueen Black, Erika North and Natasha Lipman explain what it's like to have a hidden disability, which some of your friends and family may silently be dealing with. Simon Magnus is dyslexic. He is the artistic director of arts charity Root Experience. It's taken me some time to properly ""own"" my dyslexia. It has been a source of shame and embarrassment for most of my life. In trying to conceal my condition, I have let people think I am lazy and disorganised. The truth is, I really can't get my ideas onto paper, and my fear and anxiety around ""being unable to write"" has stopped me from achieving things I wanted. I had a meeting recently and it was going well, then they asked me to do a written evaluation. It made my heart sink. I had to tell them that I couldn't do it. Eyebrows were raised, but I told them about my dyslexia and owned it. The outcome might not have been what I wanted, but it was a huge step for me. Provision for dyslexic people in everyday life is not available across the board yet, and nor is provision for those of us with anxiety or other hidden disabilities, but I hope they thought about it afterwards and perhaps, in the future, they might consider how they could work with someone like me. Invisible conditions are just different to how we think the world operates, but the more of us that 'come out' the more we realise how many people live with these experiences and that a simple change in a process can mean all the difference. Georgia Macqueen Black has Type 1 Diabetes and was diagnosed at the age of 11. She works for Shape Arts on the National Disability Arts Collection and Archive. Type 1 Diabetes cannot be seen until I take out my insulin pen and inject myself, but the mechanical parts - blood tests and injections - are only the surface layers of what I have to manage. Someone may see me inject, but there's an isolating exhaustion I take with me afterwards. There will always be another injection and it can generate a disconnection between myself and other people. Every day I gather the willpower to be a ""good"" diabetic, but when I follow the rules and still have high blood sugar I feel alone. It makes me feel foggy with a limited ability to concentrate. And the side-effects of too much or too little sugar in your blood can lead to you turning in on yourself. The biggest challenge is accepting the monotony of managing diabetes. There are days when I'm tired of having a weaker immune system - a lesser know side-effect of diabetes - or when I find lumps under my skin from injections, but then I have to put those feelings to one side and carry on. Some people might not think diabetes deserves the label ""disability"", but if unmanaged it affects my ability to carry out tasks and I have to think how exercise, stress or dehydration will impact my blood sugar levels. I often worry about how life will be when I'm older. This feeling of uncertainty hangs over me from time to time, and can make me feel lonely and a bit lost. But I know there's a silent solidarity out there. Someone with an impairment could be having a day where everything has become derailed and they feel ill, but I bet you they won't show it. It's that resilience that I really connect to. There's so much mental labour involved so if I seem distracted it's probably because of that Believe me when I ask for help. Just because I don't look like I need assistance, doesn't mean I'm OK Respect priority seats and wheelchair spaces on public transport Listen to access requirements with an open mind - often small changes make a huge difference Ask for what you need - in asking for help you don't have to pretend to be someone else Erika North has multiple sclerosis (MS). She is a broadcaster. This video can not be played Erika North presents a show on Radio Kent and has multiple sclerosis Natasha Lipman has Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome. It's a connective tissue disorder that causes dislocations, chronic pain and fatigue. She is a blogger and podcaster. If you've got an invisible disability, you've got to look convincingly stricken because people often don't believe it's there. If you were to meet me on the street, you'd probably think I was a pretty average 20-something. You'd certainly take for granted that I can stand, walk up the stairs, work and move without pain. But I can't. I suffer from severe chronic pain, my joints pop out at will and I'm often too fatigued to get out of bed. If someone knocks into me in the wrong way I could end up in hospital or wiped out from high pain levels for weeks. Standing makes me dizzy and worsens my fatigue, and being squished against other people sends me into a panic. I'm legally entitled to the same support that other disabled people get, yet I often find myself ignored or told those resources ""aren't for you"". One week, five people refused to let me sit down on the Tube - three of whom told me a healthy young girl like me should give up her seat. The only time people ever gave up their seat was when I passed out on the floor - a pretty visible sign something was wrong. I often feel humiliated when I have to beg for help and I've been lectured more times than I can count for using disabled toilets. I'm told over and over that I'm ""not disabled enough"". Over the years I've become too scared to ask for help. Things change when I show ""evidence"" of my disabilities. I use an Access Card, which states any difficulties I might face and the adjustments that could be made, and I purchased a Radar Key, which unlocks accessible toilets across the country without me having to ask permission. Despite proof, some people only take me seriously when they see me struggling. I realise most people don't understand what they can't see, but my disabilities shouldn't need to be displayed to be believed.

"This video can not be played ""One expert says the missile could reach Alaska"" North Korea's confident announcement that it has successfully launched an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) capable of striking the US is another iteration in the high stakes game of international poker that Pyongyang appears to excel at. Carefully timed to coincide with the 4 July holidays in the US, Kim Jong-un's triumphal blast has simultaneously allowed the North Korean authoritarian leader to make good on his promises of military modernisation to his own people while exposing the hollow overconfident tweets of President Donald Trump that an ICBM launch ""won't happen"". The launch of the North's Hwasong-14 rocket is in practical terms merely an incremental step forward from an earlier launch in May, when a similar rocket flew for 30 minutes, to a height of some 1,312 miles (2,111km) over a distance of some 489 miles. The most recent missile added seven to nine minutes of flight time, an extra 400 miles or so in height and a further 88 miles in overall distance. North Korea's media released a photo purportedly showing Kim Jong-un (right) celebrating the test Superficially this is simply more of the same pattern of provocation and tactical sabre-rattling that the North has been pursuing for decades, whether through its longstanding quest to acquire nuclear weapons (dating from the 1960s) or its missile testing programme, sharply accelerated in the course of last year. Yet, by bringing Alaska within range, the new test is an unambiguous game-changer in both symbolical and practical terms. US territory (albeit separate from the contiguous continental US) is now finally within Pyongyang's cross-hairs and for the first time a US president has to accept that the North poses a ""real and present"" danger not merely to north-east Asia and America's key allies - but to the US proper. How would Donald Trump respond to the North's latest test? President Trump's weakness lies in having overplayed his hand too publicly and too loudly. His initial gambit of deploying a US ""armada"" to the region in the form of the USS Carl Vinson battle group, not only involved a poor use of historical analogies (the ill-fated 16th Century Spanish fleet was probably the least auspicious of reference points), but also signally failed to intimidate the North Koreans. Similarly, openly pressuring the Chinese to impose punitive sanctions on North Korea in return for economic restraint from the US through a Trumpian concession not to list Beijing as a currency manipulator also appears to have failed. President Xi, notwithstanding the positive mood music of the April Mar-a-Lago summit, appears to have avoided being boxed in by Trump, and China's reaction to the North's latest provocation is likely to be limited to a familiar pattern of rhetorical condemnation and a call for calm from all parties. Washington's immediate options are limited. Military action - notwithstanding the hawkish recommendations of Republican senators such as John McCain and Lindsay Graham - is next to impossible given the risks involved to Seoul and the poor prospects of success, either in terms of removing the North's strategic assets or its political leadership. Sanctions are likely to be revisited, through a reconvening of the UN Security Council, but the political process is slow and enforcement is at best a partial and therefore ineffectual approach. North Korean state TV released photos of Tuesday's missile launch Talks are one way forward and the convergence of views between Washington and Seoul on the back of President Moon's recent visit to the US suggest that some sort of partial re-engagement with the North might be on the cards, albeit within a framework of reinforced deterrence. Yet, for now the momentum is all with Pyongyang, which has little incentive to sit down with the US and can afford to play for time in accelerating its military modernisation efforts while capitalising on divisions within the international community. While the US, South Korean and Japanese leaders will be united in pushing for tough measures at this week's G20 summit in Germany, they will be hard pressed to secure the support of either China or Russia for anything beyond a bland, condemnatory declaration. The dangers of the present crisis are two-fold. A more confident Kim Jong-un, emboldened by his latest success may become less risk-averse, engaging in conventional military brinkmanship which, while not going as far as pre-emptive attacks on his neighbours, might spill over into conflict through miscalculation rather than through design. Alternatively, the US confronted by the unpalatable reality of seeing the North cross yet another supposedly non-negotiable ""red line"" may simply choose to avert its eyes. For a president wedded to his own version of ""fake news"", the easiest way to cope with an inconvenient truth may be to redefine or simply ignore the original ""red line"". This would be a major mistake since it will do nothing to deter the North while encouraging other states in the region to pursue their own military modernisation plans, storing up even greater problems for the future. Ultimately, Mr Trump, if he wishes to demonstrate that he is indeed master of the ""art of the deal"", will need to give up the bully pulpit of megaphone diplomacy via twitter and pivot towards a more enlightened approach. This could involve the imaginative despatch of a high-profile US senior statesman to negotiate with and appeal to the ego and amour propre of the young North Korean leader. It could also involve closer co-ordination with America's allies, most notably South Korea, in offering some high-profile political concessions to the North - whether the establishment of a US liaison mission in Pyongyang or a sequenced pattern of asymmetric conventional force reductions on the peninsula. Right now, Washington (for the sake of the region and the wider world) urgently needs a long-term, sustained and calibrated strategy for dealing with the North that is more than a reactive game of eye-ball to eye-ball posturing. An impulsive, attention deficient and hyper-active President Trump would be better advised to switch from playing poker to chess.

"The White House expects a friendly reception in Warsaw Donald Trump is travelling to the German city of Hamburg to attend a gathering of world leaders. But before he arrives, the US president is stopping in Poland, to the delight of its conservative, nationalist government. Jaroslaw Kaczynski, who leads the ruling Law and Justice party (PiS), has said others in Europe are envious of the visit, mentioning Britain in particular. Later this month, Mr Trump will also make a presidential visit to France. So, why Poland first? US presidents are almost guaranteed a friendly reception in Poland, and this aspect of the trip will appeal to President Trump and make for good pictures at home. Authorities in Hamburg are expecting up to 100,000 protesters at the G20, and mass demonstrations are also expected in London when he finally makes a long-awaited state visit to the UK. But in Poland, the White House will be able to breathe easy. The ruling party will bus in 50 people per parliamentarian, according to the Gazeta Wyborcza newspaper, guaranteeing a friendly crowd of thousands for President Trump's speech in Warsaw's symbolic Krasinski Square on Thursday. The square is home to a monument commemorating the 1944 Warsaw Uprising against the Nazis. Some argue the bussed-in crowds are unnecessary. ""Unless they do something wrong, pretty much every American president is very popular and will get a warm welcome,"" says Professor Aleks Szczerbiak, an expert on Polish politics at the University of Sussex. George W Bush delivered a major foreign policy speech in Warsaw in 2001 Both Poland's political leaders and Mr Trump see themselves as being at the vanguard of a populist movement against liberal elites who have dominated politics in the West in recent years. They unashamedly put what they see as the national interest first, be it on climate change or migration, and receive the wrath of many for it. ""Both Kaczynski and Trump perceive themselves as those who can stop this liberal-left political correctness offensive in the world,"" says Michal Szuldrzynski, a columnist for Rzeczpospolita, an influential centre-right newspaper. ""Paradoxically, the more you criticise Mr Trump and the more you criticise Mr Kaczynski, the more they feel they are right."" Polish PM Beata Szydlo criticised for Auschwitz speech EU targets Poland, Hungary and Czechs for not taking refugees Since the PiS came into power in 2015, Poland has taken a confrontational stance within the EU and refused to abide by mandatory refugee resettlement quotas. Mr Kaczynski once said that migrants travelling to Europe were carrying dangerous diseases. Reforms made by the government at home have also attracted criticism from human rights groups and led to further conflict with the European Commission,which says the rule of law is at risk,external. Polish leaders, including Jaroslaw Kaczynski (centre), have been accused of putting rule of law in jeopardy However,while there have been calls,externalfor Mr Trump to raise issues related to human rights and democracy on his visit, few expect him to do so. His address at Krasinski Square will ""celebrate Poland's emergence as a European power"", US National Security Adviser HR McMaster says. Essentially, analysts say, it's a win-win for both sides - Mr Trump will give Poland the prestige of a visit that will bolster the government against critics that say it has isolated itself, and he will get a warm reception in a major European country run by a government that shares some of his ideology. The visit also allows Mr Trump to demonstrate that those who meet the Nato military spending target of 2% of gross domestic product will be rewarded. He is expected to praise Poland for being one of a handful of Nato members that do so. About 900 US troops are currently in Poland as part of wider efforts to soothe the anxieties of Nato members in Eastern Europe fearful of Russia. Mr Trump told Nato allies to spend more on defence at talks in Brussels in May Indeed Mr Trump's election caused some worry in Poland given expectations at the time that he could strike a grand bargain with Russian President Vladimir Putin - anathema to the Polish right. Those fears have been somewhat allayed since then but many in the region are hoping he will re-commit while he is in Warsaw to Nato's Article 5 - the principle that an attack on any ally is an attack on them all. This video can not be played US troops are welcomed in Zagan by the Polish PM and locals During his Poland trip, Donald Trump will address the Three Seas Summit, a Polish and Croatian initiative bringing together 12 nations between the Baltic, the Adriatic and the Black Sea. The summit is part of efforts to portray Poland ""as a kind of regional leader"" outside the Franco-German-dominated EU power structure with which it has clashed, says Prof Szczerbiak. And by dropping in, Mr Trump will be seen giving his blessing to a project that some EU diplomats eye with suspicion. ""The message is that the US continues to show it's not wedded simply to working with the existing European elites and that it's quite happy"" to build ties with governments challenging Brussels on certain issues, Prof Szczerbiak says. Tusk row leaves Poland isolated in EU Nato and Trump: What future for Atlantic alliance? The Polish government is trying to become less energy-dependent on Russia and last month the first ever US liquefied natural gas shipment arrived. For dealmaker Donald Trump, this is another win-win. Poland and other eastern European countries have a strategic imperative to diversify their energy sources, and the White House wants to sell more US gas overseas. He will be bringing that message to leaders at the Three Seas Summit. Nato and Trump: What future for Atlantic alliance?

"This video can not be played Eche explains how he was Tasered when sectioned under the Mental Health Act Black people are being failed by the UK's mental health services because of ""institutional racism"", it has been warned. How does this affect those who experience it? When Eche Egbuonu, who has bipolar disorder, was sectioned under the Mental Health Act, he should have been taken to a safe environment - usually a hospital - for a medical assessment. Instead, he was taken straight to a police station. ""Being in the police cell was probably the worst thing they could have done to me in the state of mind that I was in,"" he tells theBBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme. Under the Mental Health Act, a person can be detained if they are considered to be suffering from a mental disorder and in immediate need of care or control. Eche was released two days later. But shortly after, following an altercation at his home, his parents called the police. This time, after he refused to go willingly, one of the officers used a Taser. Eche says: ""I'm in my room, and I'm like, 'I'm not going [with police].' The first time, I was compliant. ""Physically they tried to get me down, that didn't work. So they brought the Taser out, 50,000 volts. ""Before I know it, I'm back in handcuffs. ""It's made me more resistant and distrusting of the system in general because it felt like a prison experience. I feel like a criminal."" The matter of black overrepresentation within the mental health system is a complex one. Statistics suggest a black man in the UK is 17 times more likely than a white man to be diagnosed with a serious mental health condition such as schizophrenia or bipolar. Black people are also four times more likely to be sectioned under the Mental Health Act. Issues such as unemployment and poverty play a part in the inequality, but there are fears that institutional racism also has a role. Councillor Jacqui Dyer says mental health services must change for black communities to trust them Jacqui Dyer - a councillor in Lambeth, London, the borough with the biggest black population in the country - believes this is the case. She is vice-chair of the government-appointed Mental Health Taskforce for England. ""What we find is that there's a differential experience so these I might describe as structural inequalities, unconscious bias, institutional racism, whatever you're more comfortable with in terms of terminology which means decisions that are made in these structures, sort of biases those communities,"" she says. Ms Dyer says there is a belief within some black communities that if you go into mental health services, ""it's not that you get recovery, it's that you die [there]"". This, she says, leads to people ""presenting later"" for treatment, when their case is more severe. ""We have to change the narrative, by actually changing the services,"" she says. The Reverend Freddie Brown says the church is ""indispensible to the solution"" According to the Reverend Freddie Brown, from Tooting New Testament Assembly, the Church could play a vital role in creating this change. He is part of the Pastor's Network, set up because of concern about the number of parishioners presenting with mental health problems. Church leaders in the network have taken accredited family therapy courses to try to improve the situation. He believes - by working with other mental health services - they can be ""indispensable to the solution"". Lorraine Khan, from the Centre for Mental Health, also believes ""institutional racism"" is embedded in the system. A new report from the think tank found when black people tried to access help, they were less likely to receive the support they wanted. They are now calling on the government to overhaul its approach to mental health to tackle the issue, which she says has been overlooked: ""I think there is a problem with institutional racism in the way we take action and try to improve things. This problem doesn't affect the majority of the country so it becomes a minority issue as far as commissioners are concerned. ""We find there's not the investment in research to improve the programmes that young men and women say they want. It's not considered the priority. The priority is, all the services are geared towards white people."" A Department of Health spokeswoman said: ""We want to make sure that everyone, regardless of ethnicity, age or background, gets the mental health treatment they need. ""Work to consider reform of mental health legislation will begin to ensure mental health is prioritised in the NHS in England - and in part reflecting concern about the disproportionate rate of detention of black people under the existing system."" Maitreya, a singer-songwriter, was sectioned for a second time a few weeks ago, following an argument with a family member. She says she found it difficult to access mental health care from the NHS in the year before she was detained. ""I was actually trying to tell them, 'I feel very much suicidal at the moment.' Maitreya says she was not taken seriously when she reported suicidal thoughts to doctors ""I took myself into a hospital. I took myself into A&E. I've called ambulances."" But Maitreya says she was not taken seriously. ""It's made me lose trust in the mental health service. ""Now I've gone through a whole process of being sectioned - and I need more help to deal with the trauma - I'm scared because I'm like, 'How will the help come now?'"" After being sectioned, Maitreya has now been diagnosed with psychosis, something she disputes. When she was detained she rejected medication, saying she had developed her own coping mechanisms. According to some experts, black people are more likely to be medicated while admitted to mental health services. Donald Masi, a psychiatric doctor, believes this is the result of a wider cultural perception that black people are more dangerous. ""Say there's a petite 50-year-old white lady with a mental illness and a 6ft [1.8m] black guy with the same illness,"" he says. Donald Masi says there is a societal perception of ""black people being the aggressor"" ""Both may be calm but may have episodes of irritability, frustration or aggression because they're distressed from their mental illness. ""People are more likely to think that the black guy is going to do something and hurt them, because essentially there is a cultural idea of black people being the aggressor."" Dr Masi says, however, that the problem is more of a wider societal issue, rather than one specific to the health service - adding that the NHS was ""a lot better than it used to be"". Eche believes in his case ""there could have been a subconscious [racial] bias"". He says: ""When I think about some of the other people that I saw in the ward, I'm like, 'What that person was doing was definitely more aggressive than me - but they stayed in that open ward, they didn't come into intensive care.'"" Eche says ""it was basically all BME [black and minority ethnic]"" in the intensive care unit. And the ""whole system needs an overhaul"" to deal with the ingrained bias. ""How race impacts your experience in the mental health system, how painful it is, I think something needs to be done,"" he says.

"Mark Maclaine, dubbed ""a super tutor"" due to his students' success rate, charges from Â£150 to Â£1,000, an hour Education services bring in Â£17.5bn a year to the UK economy, but what is driving the demand for a British education and why are some parents willing to spend thousands of pounds to secure a ""super tutor"" for their child? ""It was on the plane over I realised I'd made a mistake,"" a 25-year-old private tutor tells me. He was flying to New York to spend the summer helping to prepare a 12-year-old boy for the Common Entrance exam - a test taken by children applying to private secondary schools. The boy's mother had insisted he sat next to the boy so he could spend the flight time teaching him. He did an hour and then given they were spending the next three weeks together, decided to take a nap. The next thing he knew, he was being woken up by the mother standing over him, shouting ""You think this is some kind of holiday?"". Given the high fees charged by such tutors and the intense competition for places at top British schools it's perhaps not surprising that tensions can sometimes run high. ""In an already privileged world, tutoring is an extra level of pushing,"" he says. Foreign students often use British tutors to prepare them for private school entrance exams The Londoner uses the job's flexibility to fund his real passion of film production and acting. He is unwilling to be named in this article in case it jeopardises future jobs. Yet he says the money easily makes up for the occasional difficulties. He charges anywhere from Â£40 to Â£90 an hour in the UK, although the agencies he is hired through take a 25% to 50% cut of this. When he takes an overseas job, the fees are much higher to compensate for the fact that he can't do any other work. Typically he earns between Â£800 and Â£1,500 a week. In three years as a tutor he's worked in India, Indonesia and Costa Rica, as well as the US. Hiring an English tutor is increasingly common in many countries, particularly for those who want their children to go to an overseas private secondary school, he says. The fact that he ""sounds a bit posh"" and went to a top London school are ""valuable trading cards"" in an international industry which is ""a lot about image as well as actual background,"" he says. This kind of tutoring is one of the British education services that makes a valuable contribution to the UK economy.  Collectively, education exports were worth a whopping Â£17.5bn in 2011,the most recent figure available,external. This includes education products and services, income from international students in higher education as well as schools and English language lessons. The tradition of a British education is appealing to many wealthy overseas families Those working in the industry suggest the value is likely to have grown since then. Mark Maclaine, who co-founded the agency, Tutorfair, in 2012 after over a decade of tutoring, says overseas demand is enormous and growing. His overseas customers are mostly from Asia, the Middle East, eastern Europe and Russia. Dubbed ""a super tutor"" due to his students' success rate, he charges fees on a sliding scale, anywhere from Â£150 an hour up to a staggering Â£1,000. At the upper end of the scale, he says it's typically consultancy. A short time to teach someone how to study and prepare for an exam independently as opposed to a continuing arrangement. Word of mouth recommendations have seen him hired by US actors and actresses and he's taught in a variety of exotic locations from a yacht sailing around the Caribbean to private islands in luxury holiday resorts. He admits that the high pressure can create a toxic environment, and says experience has taught him to interview a family before he commits to a job. We're speaking over the phone while he's in Bali, where he has tagged a holiday onto the end of a tutoring job. ""The British private education system is seen as one of the best in the world. Royal families, rulers of countries are very very keen that their kids get some form of education in Britain,"" he says. Education is a valuable British export The demand is high enough that two to three times a year Mr Maclaine will get an ""emergency call"" from a family desperate for his immediate services. Normally these calls come when a child has failed a practice exam for a UK school and ""everyone panics"". Often he'll offer to tutor by Skype, but occasionally when he's offered a ""stupid amount of money"" he'll agree to fly out. ""I'm a human being. I've got a mortgage to pay"". To help address the balance, Tutorfair says that for every child whose parents pay for its service it gives tutoring to another boy or girl whose mother and father, or other guardian, cannot afford to pay. It's not just tutoring agencies cashing in on the foreign demand for a British education. The teaching at Dulwich College, Beijing, is based on the English national curriculum Many private schools have opened branches overseas: Harrow has schools in Hong Kong, Beijing, Shanghai and Bangkok; while Dulwich College and Wellington College both have overseas franchises in China. Such extensions create a handy extra revenue stream for private schools as the domestic market slows. But Charles Bonas, founder of Bonas MacFarlane, which offers tuition and also advises on choices of schools from nursery to university, says many families still prefer to send their children to school in the UK. He says partly it's because it's a way for wealthy families with drivers and nannies to help their offspring become more independent. But he says the main reasons that parents choose the UK is because English is spoken as a first language, and the education is deemed well-rounded - teaching children how to think critically and take risks.

Often parents only want the top name schools, he says recalling the time two years ago when the parents of a five-year-old girl said they wanted her to go to Eton next term. ""They didn't take no as an immediate answer,"" he says. But this is where the firm uses its consultation skills, a process costing from Â£3,000 to Â£12,000 with a relationship that can last years. ""I took on a parent last year whose children weren't even born yet. They're going to need a nursery, pre-prep, prep and a senior school,"" he explains. Whether or not these arrangements are simply perpetuating inequality, Mr Bonas argues that they are of long-term benefit to the UK, and not just because of the economic boost. ""These children have often got a family business to take over and will be the movers and shakers in their world. ""If they have an affinity for Britain then that can only be a good thing,"" he says.

"Georgia took part in a campaign as a child to show life is not restricted by diabetes Imagine having to inject yourself thousands of times over the course of your lifetime, but never talking about it to anyone. Many people live with hidden disabilities - conditions which don't have physical signs but are painful, exhausting and isolating. Sympathy and understanding from others can often be in short supply. Simon Magnus, Georgia Macqueen Black, Erika North and Natasha Lipman explain what it's like to have a hidden disability, which some of your friends and family may silently be dealing with. Simon Magnus is dyslexic. He is the artistic director of arts charity Root Experience. It's taken me some time to properly ""own"" my dyslexia. It has been a source of shame and embarrassment for most of my life. In trying to conceal my condition, I have let people think I am lazy and disorganised. The truth is, I really can't get my ideas onto paper, and my fear and anxiety around ""being unable to write"" has stopped me from achieving things I wanted. I had a meeting recently and it was going well, then they asked me to do a written evaluation. It made my heart sink. I had to tell them that I couldn't do it. Eyebrows were raised, but I told them about my dyslexia and owned it. The outcome might not have been what I wanted, but it was a huge step for me. Provision for dyslexic people in everyday life is not available across the board yet, and nor is provision for those of us with anxiety or other hidden disabilities, but I hope they thought about it afterwards and perhaps, in the future, they might consider how they could work with someone like me. Invisible conditions are just different to how we think the world operates, but the more of us that 'come out' the more we realise how many people live with these experiences and that a simple change in a process can mean all the difference. Georgia Macqueen Black has Type 1 Diabetes and was diagnosed at the age of 11. She works for Shape Arts on the National Disability Arts Collection and Archive. Type 1 Diabetes cannot be seen until I take out my insulin pen and inject myself, but the mechanical parts - blood tests and injections - are only the surface layers of what I have to manage. Someone may see me inject, but there's an isolating exhaustion I take with me afterwards. There will always be another injection and it can generate a disconnection between myself and other people. Every day I gather the willpower to be a ""good"" diabetic, but when I follow the rules and still have high blood sugar I feel alone. It makes me feel foggy with a limited ability to concentrate. And the side-effects of too much or too little sugar in your blood can lead to you turning in on yourself. The biggest challenge is accepting the monotony of managing diabetes. There are days when I'm tired of having a weaker immune system - a lesser know side-effect of diabetes - or when I find lumps under my skin from injections, but then I have to put those feelings to one side and carry on. Some people might not think diabetes deserves the label ""disability"", but if unmanaged it affects my ability to carry out tasks and I have to think how exercise, stress or dehydration will impact my blood sugar levels. I often worry about how life will be when I'm older. This feeling of uncertainty hangs over me from time to time, and can make me feel lonely and a bit lost. But I know there's a silent solidarity out there. Someone with an impairment could be having a day where everything has become derailed and they feel ill, but I bet you they won't show it. It's that resilience that I really connect to. There's so much mental labour involved so if I seem distracted it's probably because of that Believe me when I ask for help. Just because I don't look like I need assistance, doesn't mean I'm OK Respect priority seats and wheelchair spaces on public transport Listen to access requirements with an open mind - often small changes make a huge difference Ask for what you need - in asking for help you don't have to pretend to be someone else Erika North has multiple sclerosis (MS). She is a broadcaster. This video can not be played Erika North presents a show on Radio Kent and has multiple sclerosis Natasha Lipman has Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome. It's a connective tissue disorder that causes dislocations, chronic pain and fatigue. She is a blogger and podcaster. If you've got an invisible disability, you've got to look convincingly stricken because people often don't believe it's there. If you were to meet me on the street, you'd probably think I was a pretty average 20-something. You'd certainly take for granted that I can stand, walk up the stairs, work and move without pain. But I can't. I suffer from severe chronic pain, my joints pop out at will and I'm often too fatigued to get out of bed. If someone knocks into me in the wrong way I could end up in hospital or wiped out from high pain levels for weeks. Standing makes me dizzy and worsens my fatigue, and being squished against other people sends me into a panic. I'm legally entitled to the same support that other disabled people get, yet I often find myself ignored or told those resources ""aren't for you"". One week, five people refused to let me sit down on the Tube - three of whom told me a healthy young girl like me should give up her seat. The only time people ever gave up their seat was when I passed out on the floor - a pretty visible sign something was wrong. I often feel humiliated when I have to beg for help and I've been lectured more times than I can count for using disabled toilets. I'm told over and over that I'm ""not disabled enough"". Over the years I've become too scared to ask for help. Things change when I show ""evidence"" of my disabilities. I use an Access Card, which states any difficulties I might face and the adjustments that could be made, and I purchased a Radar Key, which unlocks accessible toilets across the country without me having to ask permission. Despite proof, some people only take me seriously when they see me struggling. I realise most people don't understand what they can't see, but my disabilities shouldn't need to be displayed to be believed.

We're back on Thursday morning at 6.00am with all the breaking business and economics news. Enjoy the rest of your evening. There was little change on Wall Street on Wednesday following the release of the Federal Reserve's most recent minutes. They revealed that the Fed's policymakers were split on the outlook for
inflation and how it might affect the future pace of interest
rate rises Investors had been hoping for insight on the central bank's plans
for interest rate hikes or possible balance sheet reduction.
    ""I see a murky, opaque message,"" Stephen Massocca, senior
vice president at Wedbush Securities in San Francisco, said of
the Fed minutes. The Dow Jones edged down to 21,478.17, a fall of 1 point or 0.01%. The S&P 500 was at 2,432.54, up 4 points or 0.15%. And the tech-heavy Nasdaq closed up 41 points or 0.67% at 6,150.86.  BBC World Service The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has urged leaders of the world's major economies to avoid what it called short-sighted nationalist policies and work together to resolve their trade and economic differences, reports BBC World Service. In a pointed message ahead of the G20 summit in Hamburg, the IMF said that a rule based and open trading system was vital for a stable world economy. The BBC Economics correspondent says that the strongly worded remarks appear to be implicitly directed at the US. The Trump administration is considering to impose new barriers to imports in an effort to reduce the country's trade deficit. (Such a move is seen by many other G20 member countries and the IMF as potentially damaging to the global economy). China's President Xi Jinping and German Chancellor Angela Merkel have promised to work more closely together. Speaking ahead of the G20 summit on 7-8 July, which Germany is hosting in Hamburg, President Xi said ""Chinese-German relations are now about to have a new start where we need new breakthroughs."" Mrs Merkel said: ""We will have difficult discussions, since bringing 20 states together with all their developments and ideas is not easy"" Merkel said. President Donald Trump has criticised both China and Germany over trade with the US. Snapchat have released a new location feature and many have expressed privacy concerns about it.

"Grenfell Tower survivors gathered at the Olympia conference centre in London for the meeting The scene inside Grenfell Tower is ""apocalyptic"", a coroner told angry survivors calling for more details. During a three-hour meeting with Dr Fiona Wilcox, survivors asked for information about the missing, but were told the ""recovery phase"" could last until the end of the year. Police also faced questions as to why there had not as yet been any arrests. It comes after officials said all survivors who want to be rehoused had been offered temporary accommodation. The fire on 14 June killed at least 80 people, although police say the final toll will not be known for many months. The meeting was held at the Olympia conference centre in West Kensington on Tuesday evening.

Grenfell Tower fire: Who were the victims? Lotifa Begum, from the Grenfell Muslim Response Unit (GMRU), told the Press Association some of those in attendance were ""very upset and angry"", while several became overwhelmed and had to leave. Ms Begum said many families ""would have appreciated a lot more time and notice"" before the meeting was held. Nabil Choucair fears he has lost six members of his family who lived on the 22nd floor of Grenfell Tower. Three adults - Nadia, Sirria and Bassam - are believed to have been in the flat, as well as children Zainab, Fatima and Mierna, aged three, 10 and 13. He told the BBC: ""We personally asked where is our family? We want to know are our family's bodies still there and is there anything from them? ""Whatever it is we want to know exactly what it is, do not hide anything. But the answers that were coming back were 'we don't know, we don't know, we don't know'."" This video can not be played Grenfell Tower survivor Antonio is living in a hotel and has turned down two flats. It has been reported that people were told before the meeting they would not be allowed to directly question Dr Wilcox or Met Police Commander Stuart Cundy. They were also told to email their questions in by 11:00 BST on Monday. Meanwhile, the Grenfell Response Team says 139 formal offers of housing have now been made to survivors, after Prime Minister Theresa May promised housing would be offered to those in need by Wednesday. However, only 14 offers have been accepted and many are still in hotels. A spokesman for North Kensington Law Centre - which represents more than 100 Grenfell victims - said many of the offers had been unsuitable. Sid-Ali Atmani said the accommodation his family had been offered was too far away from his daughter's school and not big enough. ""They need to deal with us as victims in an appropriate way and with dignity,"" he told BBC Breakfast. ""We become numbers and we don't have names. This is so frustratingâ¦ in three weeks they haven't found any solution.""

""I had a very comfortable and nice flat on the 10th floor,"" he told the BBC. ""I had a very comfortable life, I had a very comfortable home. ""Now the feeling is that they are trying to put us into places just to say 'we have complied with what we said we were going to do'."" Eleanor Kelly, chief executive of Southwark Council and spokeswoman for the Grenfell Response Team, told BBC Breakfast there was an ""enormous emotional impact"" on the families, so it would take time for permanent moves to take place. ""It is going to take people a long time to really work through where they want to go,"" she said. ""That's why many of the families are choosing to stay in the emergency hotel accommodation for the moment and then make a permanent move. ""We have to understand that and we have to deal with each individual family and their circumstances as appropriately and as sensitively as we can."" Robert Atkinson, leader of the Labour Party at Kensington and Chelsea Council, said decisions about accommodation should be taken by survivors when they are ready - and not just to meet government deadlines. ""It's very important that the survivors are allowed to make their decisions in their own good time and I'm somewhat annoyed at the focus on getting this target met so that the prime minister can say that she has fulfilled her promise,"" he said. ""I want these arrangements to be made in the timescale and at the pace at which the victims and survivors wish to make these decisions.""

"Students will have accrued Â£5,800 in interest charges before they graduate, says the IFS Students in England are going to graduate with average debts of Â£50,800, after interest rates are raised on student loans to 6.1%, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies. Those from the poorest backgrounds, with more loans available to support them, will graduate with debts of over Â£57,000 says the think tank. Interest charges are levied as soon as courses begin and the IFS says students on average will have accrued Â£5,800 in interest charges by the time they have graduated from university. Report author Chris Belfield describes the interest as ""very high"", but the Department for Education declined to comment on the increase in charges. Universities Minister Jo Johnson says that more disadvantaged students than ever are going to university. The study from the IFS compares England's current student finance system introduced in 2012, where fees were raised to Â£9,000, with the previous system introduced in 2006, when fees were about Â£3,000. Because the level at which graduates have to repay also increased, to Â£21,000, it meant that those with low incomes were initially better off, says the IFS. But the repayment threshold has been frozen since 2012 - and the IFS report says that graduates on all income levels are now worse off than under the previous fee regime. Students from disadvantaged backgrounds can borrow more in maintenance support - but because these are now loans rather than grants, it means that the poorest students will leave with the highest debts. Students say university value for money is falling Students face sharp rise in interest rates Student loan debt up for private sale Labour offers to scrap fees in election campaign The increase in interest rates and tuition fees going up to Â£9,250 per year will push up the cost of loans for all graduates - and higher earners will pay interest of Â£40,000 on top of the amount borrowed. Mr Belfield says the 6.1% being charged on loans is ""very high compared with current market rates"". But if loans are not repaid after 30 years, they are written off - and the IFS forecasts that about three-quarters of students will not pay off all their debt, despite making payments from their earnings into their 50s. The government also wants to sell off student loans to private investors - with somepre-2012 loans having already been put up for sale. This video can not be played Universities minister refuses to say on Today whether student loan interest rates will go down The report says there have been two main beneficiaries from the current fee system - universities and the government's finances. Universities have increased per-student funding by 25% since fees rose to Â£9,000, says the IFS, after taking into account the money they no longer receive directly from the government. Last week, Mr Johnson warned against university leaders being paid excessive salaries - with some vice-chancellors earning over Â£400,000. Replacing grants with loans and freezing the earnings threshold for repayment has made the system less expensive for the government. The IFS says that the lowest-earning third of graduates are paying 30% more than in 2012, when the Â£21,000 threshold was introduced. The switch in costs to students will mean cutting government borrowing by Â£3bn in the long term. Tuition fees became a high-profile issue during the general election - with Labour promising to scrap tuition fees. The big swing to Labour in university seats was seen as suggesting that young people were concerned about tuition fees - and plans for them to begin rising each year. Senior Conservative minister Damian Green, speaking last week, recognised that fees had become a big issue, particular for young voters, and that universities needed to show they were providing value for money. The IFS analysis says scrapping tuition fees would cost Â£11bn per year. But it also warns that continuing on the current trajectory of ""high debts, high interest rates and low repayment rates"" would mean problems both for ""graduates and the public finances"". The report says that the overall trend has been to increase university funding, reduce government spending on higher education, ""while substantially increasing payments by graduates, especially high-earning graduates"". Labour's shadow education minister, Gordon Marsden, said: ""This report shows that any argument that the current fee system is progressive is absolute nonsense. ""From scrapping the maintenance grant to freezing the repayment threshold, this government has increased the debt burden of students from disadvantaged backgrounds, who will graduate with debts in excess of Â£57,000."" ""Under the Tories, student debt continues to rise with no end in sight, and students in the UK will now graduate with a shocking average of over Â£50,000 in debt."" Mr Johnson said: ""The government consciously subsidises the studies of those who for a variety of reasons, including family responsibilities, may not repay their loans in full. ""This is a vital and deliberate investment in the skills base of this country, not a symptom of a broken student finance system. ""And the evidence bears this out: young people from poorer backgrounds are now going to university at a record rate - up 43% since 2009.""

"Grenfell Tower survivors gathered at the Olympia conference centre in London for the meeting The scene inside Grenfell Tower is ""apocalyptic"", a coroner told angry survivors calling for more details. During a three-hour meeting with Dr Fiona Wilcox, survivors asked for information about the missing, but were told the ""recovery phase"" could last until the end of the year. Police also faced questions as to why there had not as yet been any arrests. It comes after officials said all survivors who want to be rehoused had been offered temporary accommodation. The fire on 14 June killed at least 80 people, although police say the final toll will not be known for many months. The meeting was held at the Olympia conference centre in West Kensington on Tuesday evening. Three hospitals fail fire safety checks Reality Check: The Grenfell rehousing promise Grenfell Tower inquiry 'will be broad' Will a public inquiry deliver answers? What happened at Grenfell Tower? Grenfell Tower fire: Who were the victims? Lotifa Begum, from the Grenfell Muslim Response Unit (GMRU), told the Press Association some of those in attendance were ""very upset and angry"", while several became overwhelmed and had to leave. Ms Begum said many families ""would have appreciated a lot more time and notice"" before the meeting was held. Nabil Choucair fears he has lost six members of his family who lived on the 22nd floor of Grenfell Tower. Three adults - Nadia, Sirria and Bassam - are believed to have been in the flat, as well as children Zainab, Fatima and Mierna, aged three, 10 and 13. He told the BBC: ""We personally asked where is our family? We want to know are our family's bodies still there and is there anything from them? ""Whatever it is we want to know exactly what it is, do not hide anything. But the answers that were coming back were 'we don't know, we don't know, we don't know'."" This video can not be played Grenfell Tower survivor Antonio is living in a hotel and has turned down two flats. It has been reported that people were told before the meeting they would not be allowed to directly question Dr Wilcox or Met Police Commander Stuart Cundy. They were also told to email their questions in by 11:00 BST on Monday. Meanwhile, the Grenfell Response Team says 139 formal offers of housing have now been made to survivors, after Prime Minister Theresa May promised housing would be offered to those in need by Wednesday. However, only 14 offers have been accepted and many are still in hotels. A spokesman for North Kensington Law Centre - which represents more than 100 Grenfell victims - said many of the offers had been unsuitable. Sid-Ali Atmani said the accommodation his family had been offered was too far away from his daughter's school and not big enough. ""They need to deal with us as victims in an appropriate way and with dignity,"" he told BBC Breakfast. ""We become numbers and we don't have names. This is so frustratingâ¦ in three weeks they haven't found any solution."" This video can not be played Sid-Ali Atmani and daughter Hayam lived on the 15th floor in Grenfell Tower Antonio, who lived on the 10th floor of Grenfell Tower, has turned down two offers of accommodation, saying they do not meet his needs. ""I had a very comfortable and nice flat on the 10th floor,"" he told the BBC. ""I had a very comfortable life, I had a very comfortable home. ""Now the feeling is that they are trying to put us into places just to say 'we have complied with what we said we were going to do'."" Eleanor Kelly, chief executive of Southwark Council and spokeswoman for the Grenfell Response Team, told BBC Breakfast there was an ""enormous emotional impact"" on the families, so it would take time for permanent moves to take place. ""It is going to take people a long time to really work through where they want to go,"" she said. ""That's why many of the families are choosing to stay in the emergency hotel accommodation for the moment and then make a permanent move. ""We have to understand that and we have to deal with each individual family and their circumstances as appropriately and as sensitively as we can."" Robert Atkinson, leader of the Labour Party at Kensington and Chelsea Council, said decisions about accommodation should be taken by survivors when they are ready - and not just to meet government deadlines. ""It's very important that the survivors are allowed to make their decisions in their own good time and I'm somewhat annoyed at the focus on getting this target met so that the prime minister can say that she has fulfilled her promise,"" he said. ""I want these arrangements to be made in the timescale and at the pace at which the victims and survivors wish to make these decisions.""

"Helen Pearson says she felt like she wasn't being believed or taken seriously Victims of harassment and stalking are being left at risk because of failings by police and prosecutors in England and Wales, say two watchdogs. Crimes were not being recorded,said a report by,externalthe Inspectorate of Constabulary and the Crown Prosecution Service Inspectorate. It also said too many investigations were poorly run and failed to give victims legal protection. Police and prosecution chiefs have pledged to improve performance. The joint inspection looked at 112 recent cases of stalking and harassment in depth, but not a single one was dealt with properly, the report said. One victim said police made her feel she was to blame for receiving abusive messages on social media. ""It was my fault for being on Facebook,"" she said. 'My stalking hell' Stalked woman rejects police apology Clinic opens to support stalking victims The report also said police officers were failing to recognise repeated signs of a stalker, by treating each complaint in isolation rather than being part of a pattern. That, in turn, meant police and prosecutors did not see the bigger picture and appreciate the full scale of the harm suffered by the victim. Helen Pearson, from Devon, reported her stalker to the police 125 times over five years. ""They literally didn't want to know,"" she said. ""I was a nuisance."" She reported every case of gunged-up door locks, threatening letters and phone calls, bricks through windows, slashed car tyres, even a dead cat left on her doorstep but police never linked them all together, she told BBC's Victoria Derbyshire. ""You could see it escalating - you felt like you were screaming with your mouth shut,"" she said. In 2013, she was stabbed and left for dead by her stalker. Such cases are known as ""murder in slow motion"", said Laura Richards, from the National Stalking Advocacy Service, Paladin, who is calling for better training and leadership from the police. ""I will stay in your life forever... I will make sure nothing in your life or your family's ever runs smoothly"" is one female stalker's threat to her victim, also a woman. One person told researchers: ""It got to the point where I actually said to my mum one night that 'Do you know what? I'm going to be a story in the newspaper. I'm going to be another one of these girls that gets murdered by her ex'."" The report said many victims felt ""constantly on edge"". One victim, stalked by her ex-partner, said: ""Every time my phone went, it made me nervous... Every time the doorbell went, or there was a bang on the door, me and the children would be really scared."" They interviewed a female bank employee, who told police a male stranger kept visiting her at work - leaving gifts and following her after she finished work to a bus stop. The employee was transferred to another bank branch, but the man tracked her down. She then confronted him, and he became angry. But police did not arrest or interview the man, instead issuing him with a Police Information Notice (PIN). This takes the form of a written warning which is signed by the recipient. It is not a formal police caution, nor is it covered by legislation. However, they can be used in future legal proceedings to show the suspect knew their behaviour was considered to be harassment. The report said such notices were being misused and did not cover all types of offences. Wendy Williams, who led the inspection for Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary, said: ""Police forces must act quickly to protect victims, including survivors of domestic abuse leaving coercive or controlling relationships. ""It is not acceptable that victims and their families are left to live in fear. ""While we found some evidence that the police and CPS understand the risks of the repeat behaviours... we found worrying failings at every stage, including reporting, investigation and prosecution. Changes need to be made immediately."" The report calls for: A review of the key law on harassment More clearly defined offences Better risk assessments for victims Expanding court orders to cover more circumstances Instead of thoroughly investigating stalking cases and protecting the victim, police officers were issuing Police Information Notices (PINs), said the inspectorate. By signing one, a person is not admitting any wrongdoing, but that means there is no right of appeal. In 2015, a government report acknowledged that the lack of any appeal procedure against a PIN ""can feel very unfair to recipients"". The inspectorate wants to see them scrapped immediately. It also warned that a proposed court order to protect victims of stalking would not help victims of harassment, such as people fleeing domestic violence. The report says stalking is ""a pattern of unwanted, persistent pursuit and intrusive behaviour... that engenders fear and distress in the victim and is characterised by an obsessive fixation with the victim"". It can include following the victim, repeatedly contacting them or trying to do so and monitoring their activity online. Someone commits a crime of harassment if their behaviour is oppressive or unreasonable to such an extent that it causes alarm or distress, or puts someone in fear of violence. The Suzy Lamplugh Trust, which runs the National Stalking Helpline, said the failures identified in the report were unacceptable. And Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders said she would introduce mandatory stalking and harassment training for all prosecutors. Assistant Chief Constable Garry Sherwan, the National Police Chief Council's lead for stalking, said: ""I will be writing to all chief constables to make sure officers are aware of the powers they have to tackle cases of stalking or harassment and that cases must be recorded and monitored. ""We want to see numbers of people prosecuted for stalking and harassment increase.""
