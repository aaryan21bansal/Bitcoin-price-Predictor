"The first votes of the 2020 primary presidential election have been cast in the Midwestern state of Minnesota. Voters are deciding which Democratic presidential hopeful they want to become the party's eventual nominee in the November presidential election. Though Iowa's contest next month will be the first to announce a candidate as winning the state, early voting began in Minnesota on Friday. Thousands of early ballots have already been cast. The nation is fixated on Iowa's caucus - party-held elections across the state's precincts - on 3 February as the start of the 2020 election season, but voters from several states will have already had their say by then. Who will take on Trump in 2020? US election 2020 : All you need to know What US farmers make of Trump's trade deal After this primary election process, each party will name their presidential nominee in the summer. Voters will then cast their ballots for the next president of the United States on 3 November. Facing frigid temperatures of -2Â°F (-19Â°C), voters in Minneapolis - the seat of Minnesota's largest county - were already arriving to vote at 08:00 local time, when polling stations opened. ""We even had a little bit of a line,"" Ginny Gelms, the Hennepin county elections manager, told the BBC. Representative Ilhan Omar speaks in support of candidate Bernie Sanders on the first day of early voting in Minneapolis Over 280 people had cast ballots in person in the county before noon and over 6,000 more had been received by post, Ms Gelms said. Thirty-eight US states and the District of Columbia allow voters to cast ballots before election day, either in person or by mail. These 'absentee' ballots are often used by soldiers, US personnel overseas, or those not able to get to a poll station on election day. Though some jurisdictions have already begun accepting ballots by post, Minnesota is the first to open polling stations where voters can turn up. Minnesota voters braved freezing temperatures to get to the ballot box They have 46 days to vote before the state's primary election day on 3 March, when over a dozen other states and territories will also hold their primary contests on the so-called 'Super Tuesday'. Vermont, Virginia and North Dakota will also open polls for early voters on Saturday. Early voting has become increasingly popular, though most voters still wait until election day. In 2000, 16% of voters cast early ballots in the general election, compared to nearly 40% in 2016. Amy Klobuchar, a Minnesota senator who is running for president, campaigned in her home state as polls were open, but others were on the ground in Iowa and New Hampshire, which hold primary contests next month. Democratic candidate Amy Klobuchar campaigned in her home state of Minnesota on the first day of voting A strong result in the two February races can give a lift to campaigns. Joe Biden, the former vice president, and Bernie Sanders, the Vermont senator, are the frontrunners, according to polls. Though Mr Sanders was not there for the first ballots, Ilhan Omar, a Minnesota congresswoman and supporter, campaigned in the state Friday on his behalf. Candidates still have a long road ahead.

"The minister said his speech was a ""rhetorical coincidence"" Brazil's culture minister has been sacked after using parts of a speech by Nazi Germany's propaganda chief Joseph Goebbels in a video, sparking outrage. In the clip posted on the ministry's Twitter page, Roberto Alvim detailed an award for ""heroic"" and ""national"" art. Lohengrin by Wagner, Hitler's favourite composer, played in the background. Earlier, Mr Alvim said the now-deleted video was a ""rhetorical coincidence"". Far-right President Jair Bolsonaro said the speech had been ""unfortunate"". ""I reiterate our rejection of totalitarian and genocidal ideologies, such as Nazism and communism, as well as any inference to them. We also express our full and unrestricted support for the Jewish community, of which we're friends and share many common values,"" the president said on Twitter. How Brazil's culture wars are being waged in classrooms Jair Bolsonaro: Brazil's unlikely president In the six-minute video detailing the National Arts Awards, Mr Alvim said: ""The Brazilian art of the next decade will be heroic and will be national, will be endowed with great capacity for emotional involvement... deeply linked to the urgent aspirations of our people, or else it will be nothing."" Parts of it were identical to a speech quoted in the book Joseph Goebbels: A Biography, by German historian Peter Longerich, who has written several works on the Holocaust. ""The German art of the next decade will be heroic, it will be steely-romantic, it will be factual and completely free of sentimentality, it will be national with great pathos and binding, or it will be nothing."" Goebbels led the Ministry of Enlightenment and Propaganda,designed to brainwash people into obeying the Nazis and idolising leader Adolf Hitler. Its methods included censorship of the press and control of radio broadcasts, as well as control of culture and arts. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

In a post on his Facebook page, Mr Alvim, a theatre director who was appointed to the ministerial post last year, said ""the left was doing a fallacious remote association"" between the two speeches, and that ""there was nothing wrong with his sentence"". ""The whole speech was based on a nationalistic ideal for the Brazilian art and there was a coincidence with ONE sentence of a speech by Goebbels. I didn't quote him and I'd NEVER do it... But the sentence itself is perfect."" Later, in a second post, he said ""the speech had been written from various ideas linked to nationalist art that had been brought by his advisers"". He did not comment on the music that played in the video in any of his posts. Among those who called for him to be fired was the Speaker of the lower house of Brazil's Congress, Rodrigo Maia, who said Mr Alvim had ""gone beyond all limits"" with an ""inacceptable"" video. The Brazilian Israelite Confederation said: ""To emulate [Goebbels'] view... is a frightening sign of his vision of culture, which must be combated and contained."" It called for Mr Alvim's  immediate removal, adding: ""Brazil, which sent brave soldiers to combat Nazism on European soil, doesn't deserve it."" Mr Bolsonaro, a former army captain with a conservative social agenda, has frequently accused Brazil's artists and cultural productions including schoolbooks and movies of ""left-wing bias"".

"Police stood guard at a climate change protest by Extinction Rebellion in Edinburgh last summer Policing the UN climate change conference in Glasgow will cost more than Â£200m, Scotland's chief constable has said. Iain Livingstone told the Scottish Police Authority (SPA) the COP26 event in November would be one of the largest ever staged in the UK. The chief constable also said Police Scotland had taken Â£200m a year out of the core cost of policing. This was despite demands on officers increasing in 2019, he said. Mr Livingstone pointed out that there had been an almost 20% rise - from about 1,500 to 1,800 - in the number of loyalist and republican marches in Scotland, as well as a higher number of spontaneous protests such as those by Extinction Rebellion. Chief Constable Iain Livingstone said a considerable number of officers would be coming to Scotland from south of the border Acting chairman of the authority, David Crichton, told the board meeting that the current number of officers in Scotland was ""not sustainable"". He said the vast majority of the police budget had already been allocated to cover officer and staff costs. He added that the Scottish Police Authority had been raising concerns about financial sustainability over the past four or five months, along with the chief constable and Audit Scotland. ""There is a structural deficit in the policing budget,"" he said. ""It's simple arithmetic, it's not complicated mathematics, it's simple arithmetic. ""With almost 90% of the budget allocated to officer and staff costs, it does mean that difficult choices are going to have to be made over the next weeks and months - difficult choices by government, by the authority and by Police Scotland."" Climate summit to cost 'hundreds of millions' The 'intolerable' cost of staging the G8 summit Five things we've learned from Madrid climate talks Treasury to cover Trump visit police bill Mr Livingstone told the meeting: ""At the moment there's an operational imperative, I sense an element of political imperative, to maintain officer numbers and the challenge for us is showing the value that having a strong police service provides and at this stage, making a case for further investment. ""We've had real-time protection but that's only kicked in since 2015-2016, but the core cost of policing is Â£200m less every year than it was prior to Police Scotland coming into being (in April 2013). ""So our deficit is because actually our budget has been cut even greater than the savings that we've managed to achieve. ""So my pitch is, can we get some of those savings back?"" The meeting was told that the current number of police officers in Scotland was ""not sustainable"" Mr Livingstone also told the SPA that a considerable number of officers would be coming to Scotland from south of the border to help police COP26. He said their accommodation costs alone would be ""tens of millions of pounds"" and deposits on accommodation were estimated at Â£2m, which needed to be paid by next month. Members were also told Police Scotland's plans to reduce officer numbers by 400 this year had been put on hold. Scottish officers to be sent to London protests Police Scotland spend Â£7m on Brexit planning More than 250 police cars a decade old Police to put 400 officers on 'Brexit duty' Mr Livingstone said major events such as the European Football championships and continuing uncertainty about the Brexit settlement were adding to pressure on the force even before policing of COP26 was taken into account. Up to 90,000 people - delegates, observers, heads of state and media - are expected to attend COP26, over 12 days from 9-20 November. AScottish Police Authority report,externaldescribed it as the largest mobilisation of police officers in the UK. Scottish ministers say they expect the UK government to cover the ""core costs"", including emergency services funding. The UK government has said discussions with the Scottish government on the conference costs are ""currently ongoing"". Up to 200 world leaders are expected to attend COP26. It will be held at the Scottish Event Campus (SEC) but other venues across the city will also host functions and meetings for heads of state and other dignitaries. The SEC will be handed over to the UN for the duration of the conference. Known as the ""blue zone"", it will become international territory, subject to international law.

"This video can not be played Victoria Atkins: I have suffered sexual harassment Women and Equalities Minister Victoria Atkins has spoken of her experiences of workplace sexual harassment, as she urged others to share their stories. In one example, the minister revealed, someone had sent her an email ""that showed a great interest in my footwear"", after a public appearance. ""That was something that made me feel uncomfortable,"" she told LBC radio. The government is surveying 12,000 people to find out the extent of workplace harassment. The Government Equalities Office survey is part of an initiative to tackle the problem, including a new statutory code of practice for employers. Ms Atkins said ""common sense"" was needed to determine what qualified as sexual harassment in the workplace. New advice issued to prevent workplace harassment Workplace 'power imbalance' to be challenged Labour peer suspended after 'stalkerish behaviour' Comments crossed the line when they made others feel ""intimidated, distressed or humiliated"", she told LBC. Giving an example, she said: ""Yesterday, I was wearing a very colourful skirt and everybody was saying how wonderful it looks. I did not take that as sexual harassment. ""But I was telling officials that, after a public appearance, I had an individual email about my footwear. It was in a way that showed a great interest in my footwear. ""And that was something that made me feel uncomfortable. ""I think common sense here will prevail and we just want to gather the evidence to see how people react to different types of behaviour."" Speaking earlier to BBC Breakfast, Ms Atkins said: ""This is not a debate about wolf-whistling or whatever. We have 15 categories of behaviour that are serious."" She said the government wanted to find out how people had been affected by harassment, and how they dealt with it, ""so that we can ensure that our workplaces are pleasant places to work"". Ms Atkins added that she did not want to go into the details of the harassment she has been subjected to, adding: ""I'm not going to be defined by the grubby behaviour of the men that behaved like that towards me."" The minister was asked about Crystal Palace's woman goalkeeper Lucy Gillett, who said she had received sexist abuse during Sunday's Championship game at Coventry United. The 25-year-old alleged that men in the crowd had called on the referee to ""check the gender"" of several Palace players. Palace keeper 'subjected to sexist abuse' Ms Atkins said: ""That is her workplace. The FA or referees should have acted on it. ""She and others are entitled to not have to put up with that sort of abuse. It's just not on."" The Football Association has been made aware of the incident, and is looking into it. A spokesperson said the organisation was ""committed to tackling homophobia, biphobia and transphobia in football at every level of the game"".

"There were six coronaviruses known to infect people before the latest discovery The number of people already infected by the mystery virus emerging in China is far greater than official figures suggest, scientists have told the BBC. There have been more than 60 confirmed cases of the new coronavirus, but UK experts estimate a figure nearer 1,700. Two people are known to have died from the respiratory illness, which appeared in Wuhan city in December. ""I am substantially more concerned than I was a week ago,"" disease outbreak scientist Prof Neil Ferguson, said. The work was conducted by the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis at Imperial College London, which advises bodies including the UK government and the World Health Organization (WHO). 'Sars-family' virus claims second victim in China Mystery virus: How worried should we be? Singapore and Hong Kong have been screening air passengers from Wuhan, and US authorities announced similar measures starting on Friday at three major airports in San Francisco, Los Angeles and New York. The crucial clue to the scale of the problem lies in the cases being detected in other countries. While the outbreak is centred on the central Chinese city of Wuhan, there have been two cases in Thailand and one in Japan. ""That caused me to worry,"" said Prof Ferguson. He added: ""For Wuhan to have exported three cases to other countries would imply there would have to be many more cases than have been reported."" It is impossible to get the precise number, but outbreak modelling, which is based on the virus, the local population and flight data, can give an idea. Wuhan International Airport serves a population of 19 million people, but only 3,400 a day travel internationally. The detailed calculations, which have beenposted online,externalahead of publication in a scientific journal, came up with a figure of 1,700 cases. Allow Twitter content?

Prof Ferguson said it was ""too early to be alarmist"" but he was ""substantially more concerned"" than a week ago. Chinese officials say there have been no cases of the virus spreading from one person to another. Instead they say the virus has crossed the species barrier and come from infected animals at a seafood and wildlife market in Wuhan. Prof Ferguson argues: ""People should be considering the possibility of substantial human-to-human transmission more seriously than they have so far. ""It would be unlikely in my mind, given what we know about coronaviruses, to have animal exposure, be the principal cause of such a number of human infections."" Understanding how a novel virus is spreading is a crucial part of assessing its threat. The WHO's China office said the analysis was helpful and would help officials plan the response to the outbreak. ""Much remains to be understood about the new coronavirus,"" it said. ""Not enough is known to draw definitive conclusions about how it is transmitted, the clinical features of the disease, the extent to which it has spread, or its source, which remains unknown."" The outbreak occurred in the city of Wuhan, south of Beijing Viral samples have been taken from patients and analysed in the laboratory. And officials in China andthe World Health Organization,externalhave concluded the infection is a coronavirus. Coronaviruses are a broad family of viruses, butonly six (the new one would make it seven) are known to infect people,external. At the mild end they cause the common cold, but severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) is a coronavirus that killed 774 of the 8,098 people infected in an outbreak that started in China in 2002. Analysis of the genetic code of the new virus shows it is more closely related to Sars than any other human coronavirus. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The virus has caused pneumonia in some patients and been fatal in two of them. Dr Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome medical research charity, said: ""There is more to come from this epidemic. ""Uncertainty and gaps remain, but it's clear that there is some level of person-to-person transmission. This video can not be played Coronavirus feared to have infected more than initially thought, according to scientists ""We are starting to hear of more cases in China and other countries and it is likely, as this modelling shows, that there will be many more cases in a number of countries."" Prof Jonathan Ball, from the University of Nottingham, said: ""What's really important is until there has been widespread laboratory testing it is very difficult to put a real number on the cases out there. ""But this is a figure we should take seriously until we know otherwise, 41 animal-to-human 'spillovers' is stretching it a bit and there probably is more underlying infection than has been detected so far.""

"This video can not be played Conner Marshall mother: His face was a mass of bruising A coroner has criticised the probation service's ""woefully inadequate"" management of a case worker supervising a man who beat a teenager to death. David Braddon, 26, mistook Conner Marshall, 18, for his estranged partner's former boyfriend. Braddon was jailed for life for Mr Marshall's murder in 2015. In a narrative conclusion at the Pontypridd inquest on Friday, assistant coroner Nadim Bashir said Braddon's case worker was ""overwhelmed"". He described how Kathryn Oakley accepted a number of times she could have done more with the supervision of Braddon. Family 'denied access' to killer's probation report Offender deemed 'low risk' When the attack happened Braddon was under supervision for drug offences and assaulting a police officer. Probation reforms took place in 2014, with privately-run community rehabilitation companies (CRCs) taking on the work. Following this,some staff were behind with their work, the inquest in Pontypridd had heard. Mr Bashir described Braddon's probation officer Ms Oakley as being ""brand new to her role"" after starting in January 2014. ""She should have been supervised by a team manager once every six to eight weeks,"" he said. ""She had weak team managers with no team manager oversight of her case work load. ""The management and supervision of her was woefully inadequate."" David Braddon is serving a life sentence for murder ""The failures, however, must have a direct and clear causal connection with Conner Marshall's death and must contribute in a more than minimal way,"" he added. ""But I am satisfied there was no possible or even probable evidential link that led to Conner Marshall's death. ""Put simply, his death could not have been foreseen or predicted, let alone prevented."" Nadine Marshall spoke at the end of the inquest Following the inquest, Mr Marshall's mother Nadine said his death had followed the ""chaos"" after the privatisation of probation services. ""Today is the culmination of almost five years of struggle to obtain truth and justice for Conner and find out why our much loved son was the victim of a callous and unprovoked attack,"" she said. She added the supervision of Braddon was ""not robust"" and the management system in Wales ""wholly inadequate"". Mrs Marshall said ""we will never know if our son would still be here today"" if things had operated differently. Following the inquest, the trade union for probation and family court staff Napo said it had raised ""serious concerns"" about the firm responsible for probation services in Wales. It said staff had complained about excessive workloads, exacerbated by Working Links' decision to make 40% of staff redundant when it took over operations in 2014. General secretary Ian Lawrence said: ""Time and time again we are seeing our members being scapegoated by management across both the public and private arms of probation when a serious further offence occurs. ""This is especially relevant in this tragic case when there is so much empirical evidence to suggest that Working Links were incapable of running a safe and effective operational model."" He said before Working Links went into administration last year, Napo warned ministers that its contract was ""failing on every level"". National Probation Service Wales director, Ian Barrow, said: ""This was an awful crime and our thoughts remain with Conner Marshall's family and friends. ""While the coroner found Conner's death could not have been avoided, there is no doubt David Braddon's probation supervision was not good enough. ""We have now taken responsibility for managing all offenders on licence in Wales from the Community Rehabilitation Company and 800 more probation officers are in training across England and Wales which will help to improve public protection."" If nothing else, this inquest has highlighted how difficult probation's role is. On a daily basis, officers juggle supervision of a number of people living chaotic lives. Processes are put in place to try and manage that, but in this case the needs of a junior probation service officer weren't adequately supported. Managers were aware she was feeling overwhelmed but an online tool suggested her workload was fine - others were coping, after all. And so somewhere in the midst of a changing structure, the needs of Kathryn Oakley were overlooked. It has taken a coroner looking at the inner workings of a service to see this was ""woefully inadequate"". It is now down to the Ministry of Justice and National Probation Service to give reassurance that the new way of working is different.

"Robert Pugh, 75, assaulted boys in the 1980s and 1990s A former climbing instructor has been jailed for two-and-a-half years after indecently assaulting three boys. Robert Pugh, 75, of Cardiff, assaulted the boys at Storey Arms outdoor activity centre in the Brecon Beacons during the 1980s and 1990s. He was found guilty of 10 charges at Cardiff Crown Court in December and remanded in custody before being sentenced on Friday. All three victims were under 16 when Pugh started abusing them. Speaking to the BBC, one victim said he ""suffered some very dark times"" during the process of getting the case through court. ""I'm getting myself better and can look forward to moving on with my life,"" he said. ""There are no winners here, just people who wanted to right Bob's wrongs. So I thank the jury for believing us and reaching the rightful verdict."" He said the victims were ""groomed with preferential treatment"". ""After he attacked me, I got out of the situation, moved away, and didn't trust anyone anymore. And self-destructing tendencies have been in my life ever since."" He said he took action when he discovered in later life he was not the only victim and contacted the police. Boy 'repeatedly assaulted by climbing instructor' Boy 'shared tent with abuser for free holiday' ""It's hard to accept it's taken me 20 years to get here as my accusations were not taken seriously or followed up for a long time. However, it was worth it, despite the negative effects it's had on my life,"" he said. ""I'm glad Bob has been found unanimously guilty and I am vindicated."" He and another victim both described having self-destructive and risk-taking tendencies and problems with alcohol. Robert Pugh was found guilty of 10 charges at Cardiff Crown Court in December The prosecution said beneath Pugh's respectable exterior ""there was something that drove him to touch these boys"". The court heard the boys seen as Pugh's favourites were offered additional courses, received gifts and were taken to a pub. Judge Michael Fitton told Pugh he had ""a sexual interest and desire for boys and young men"". ""You have harmed three young men in the ways they have described to the jury,"" he added. ""Two of them have been harmed significantly."" The judge was told by Pugh's barrister he still maintained his innocence. The jury was previouslydirected to find Pugh not guiltyof three charges of historical child abuse due to a lack of evidence. Storey Arms Outdoor Activity Centre has been part of Cardiff council's education service since 1971 Following the sentencing, a Cardiff council spokesman expressed his deepest sympathy to everyone affected and said ""significant changes"" have taken place across Wales regarding the safeguarding of children.

"Ken Starr, Pam Bondi and Alan Dershowitz have joined the president's defence team US President Donald Trump's defence team in his Senate trial will include special prosecutors from President Bill Clinton's impeachment. He will be represented by Ken Starr and Robert Ray, who investigated Mr Clinton, and Alan Dershowitz, whose past clients include OJ Simpson. White House counsel Pat Cipollone and Mr Trump's personal lawyer Jay Sekulow will lead the team. Opening statements in the Trump impeachment trial will begin next week. Mr Starr was the US Department of Justice independent counsel who investigated the Whitewater affair, a scandal-plagued mid-1980s land venture in Arkansas involving Bill and Hillary Clinton. The inquiry ultimately uncovered unrelated evidence that Mr Clinton had been having an affair with a White House intern, Monica Lewinsky. The investigation culminated in the Democratic president's impeachment by the US House of Representatives in 1998. Mr Clinton was acquitted by the Senate. This video can not be played Trump and Clinton's impeachment - what's different? Mr Ray succeeded Mr Starr as the independent counsel. Ms Lewinsky tweeted on Friday shortly after Mr Trump's team was announced: ""This is definitely an 'are you kidding me?' kinda day"", though she inserted an expletive. In 2016, Mr Starr was forced out of his position as president of Baylor University after an inquiry found the school had mishandled rape accusations against its football players. He later also resigned from his roles as chancellor and law professor at the university. Trump impeachment trial: All you need to know Mr Dershowitz is a retired Harvard University law professor and constitutional law expert whose past celebrity clients have also included boxer Mike Tyson. He told CBS News, the BBC's US partner, that he had spoken to the president on Wednesday about the impeachment case. ""I agreed to do it as an independent constitutional scholar,"" Mr Dershowitz said. ""I take no position on the politics - just on the constitution."" He added he was ""very, very concerned"" about the precedent this impeachment could establish. ""It could weaken the presidency and weaponise impeachment as a partisan tactic,"" he said. This video can not be played How did we get here? Mr Dershowitz said in a statement that he had also opposed Mr Clinton's impeachment, and voted for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election. The president sought Mr Dershowitz's advice, too, during the 2017-19 special counsel investigation into alleged Russian meddling in the US presidential election. Mr Dershowitz and Mr Starr both represented disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein during his 2008 abuse trial. Axios reported,externalthat some White House officials were against Mr Dershowitz joining the team, given his ties to Mr Epstein. Trump impeachment: A very simple guide The case for and against impeaching Trump Trump impeachment trial: All you need to know On Friday, the president shared Mr Dershowitz's comments criticising a Government Accountability Office ruling that the White House had broken the law by withholding aid to Ukraine.

Former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi has also been asked to join the team. Mrs Bondi, a longtime Trump ally, joined the White House communications team last November to focus on ""proactive impeachment messaging"". The president's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani, a central figure in the Ukraine investigation, had also hoped to join the defence, but he did not make the cut. Mr Giuliani told CBS he might be called as a witness in the impeachment trial and ""understood this may happen if I uncovered the 2016 Ukrainian corruption"". This video can not be played Trump and Clinton's impeachment - what's different? He was apparently referring to a discredited theory that Ukraine intervened in the last White House election. One of Mr Giuliani's associates, Ukrainian-American businessman Lev Parnas, has said he went to Ukraine to pressure local officials on behalf of Mr Trump and Mr Giuliani. Mr Trump's allies have rubbished Mr Parnas' claims, pointing out that he is facing unrelated campaign finance charges. Mr Trump was impeached by the US House of Representatives last month on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. Democrats have accused him of withholding military aid to Ukraine to pressure the country into investigating his political rival, former US Vice-President Joe Biden. Mr Trump denies the claims, and calls the impeachment proceedings a partisan ""hoax"". The Republican president now faces a trial in the Senate, which must decide whether to remove him from office. As his Republican party holds a majority in the upper chamber, he is expected to be acquitted.

"Police stood guard at a climate change protest by Extinction Rebellion in Edinburgh last summer Policing the UN climate change conference in Glasgow will cost more than Â£200m, Scotland's chief constable has said. Iain Livingstone told the Scottish Police Authority (SPA) the COP26 event in November would be one of the largest ever staged in the UK. The chief constable also said Police Scotland had taken Â£200m a year out of the core cost of policing. This was despite demands on officers increasing in 2019, he said. Mr Livingstone pointed out that there had been an almost 20% rise - from about 1,500 to 1,800 - in the number of loyalist and republican marches in Scotland, as well as a higher number of spontaneous protests such as those by Extinction Rebellion. Chief Constable Iain Livingstone said a considerable number of officers would be coming to Scotland from south of the border Acting chairman of the authority, David Crichton, told the board meeting that the current number of officers in Scotland was ""not sustainable"". He said the vast majority of the police budget had already been allocated to cover officer and staff costs. He added that the Scottish Police Authority had been raising concerns about financial sustainability over the past four or five months, along with the chief constable and Audit Scotland. ""There is a structural deficit in the policing budget,"" he said. ""It's simple arithmetic, it's not complicated mathematics, it's simple arithmetic. ""With almost 90% of the budget allocated to officer and staff costs, it does mean that difficult choices are going to have to be made over the next weeks and months - difficult choices by government, by the authority and by Police Scotland."" Climate summit to cost 'hundreds of millions' The 'intolerable' cost of staging the G8 summit Five things we've learned from Madrid climate talks Treasury to cover Trump visit police bill Mr Livingstone told the meeting: ""At the moment there's an operational imperative, I sense an element of political imperative, to maintain officer numbers and the challenge for us is showing the value that having a strong police service provides and at this stage, making a case for further investment. ""We've had real-time protection but that's only kicked in since 2015-2016, but the core cost of policing is Â£200m less every year than it was prior to Police Scotland coming into being (in April 2013). ""So our deficit is because actually our budget has been cut even greater than the savings that we've managed to achieve. ""So my pitch is, can we get some of those savings back?"" The meeting was told that the current number of police officers in Scotland was ""not sustainable"" Mr Livingstone also told the SPA that a considerable number of officers would be coming to Scotland from south of the border to help police COP26. He said their accommodation costs alone would be ""tens of millions of pounds"" and deposits on accommodation were estimated at Â£2m, which needed to be paid by next month. Members were also told Police Scotland's plans to reduce officer numbers by 400 this year had been put on hold. Scottish officers to be sent to London protests Police Scotland spend Â£7m on Brexit planning More than 250 police cars a decade old Police to put 400 officers on 'Brexit duty' Mr Livingstone said major events such as the European Football championships and continuing uncertainty about the Brexit settlement were adding to pressure on the force even before policing of COP26 was taken into account. Up to 90,000 people - delegates, observers, heads of state and media - are expected to attend COP26, over 12 days from 9-20 November. AScottish Police Authority report,externaldescribed it as the largest mobilisation of police officers in the UK. Scottish ministers say they expect the UK government to cover the ""core costs"", including emergency services funding. The UK government has said discussions with the Scottish government on the conference costs are ""currently ongoing"". Up to 200 world leaders are expected to attend COP26. It will be held at the Scottish Event Campus (SEC) but other venues across the city will also host functions and meetings for heads of state and other dignitaries. The SEC will be handed over to the UN for the duration of the conference. Known as the ""blue zone"", it will become international territory, subject to international law.

"Retail sales fell again in December as a Christmas shopping spree failed to materialise. Sales volumes fell by 0.6% from November, the fifth month in a row without growth,the Office for National Statistics said,external. It comes amid worries about economic growth and forecasts that the Bank of England could cut interest rates soon. Food stores were hard hit, with the quantity bought falling by the biggest amount since December 2016. ""Anecdotal evidence from a number of stores stated that goods did not sell as well as expected,"" the ONS said. The latest figures are published as UK High Streets continue to face tough trading conditions, with big chains such as Mothercare and Thomas Cook going bust in recent months. The December 2019 figures, unlike those for the same month in 2018, include Black Friday sales, but the ONS said it had seasonally adjusted its data to account for this shift. How to save the UK's crisis-hit High Streets Department store Beales warns of collapse risk Trading statements for the Christmas season from the country's biggest supermarkets had already indicated that households spent less on festive fare in 2019 than they had the previous year. Sales at food stores fell 1.3% in December from the previous month, the ONS said. Department stores were also under pressure, with sales down 1.8% month-on-month, as were clothing stores, which saw a 2% fall in sales. This is yet more proof, if it were needed, that December was tough for retailers. The so-called golden quarter was far from sparkling and it's clear that it failed to deliver what many businesses wanted. Black Friday, which came late this year, really has shifted the pattern of spending, with sales simply being pulled forward instead of boosting overall spending. Despite wages now rising faster than inflation, and healthier household finances overall, retail isn't getting its share of spending from disposable income that it once did. But amid the gloom, some retailers have done well by giving customers what they want as well along with selling the right products at the right price. Household goods and fuel were the only sectors that saw an increase. Online sales accounted for 19% of December's retail spending, up from 18.6% the previous month. Last week, the British Retail Consortium said 2019 had beenthe worst year for retailers since 1995. ""The picture we're seeing from trading figures is that shoppers reined in spending in the months ahead of Christmas, with the December monthly figure showing there was no festive bounce to make up for lost ground,"" said Ed Monk, associate director for personal investing at Fidelity International. At the same time, Andrew Carlisle, managing director and UK retail consulting lead at Accenture, struck a more optimistic note. ""While these figures won't dispel concerns around the challenging UK retail climate, the picture is not all doom and gloom,"" he said. ""Consumer confidence rose to its highest since July last month, showing there could be better times ahead in 2020. Retailers will be hoping that an economic bounce and regulatory relief will see an upturn in fortunes."" But Capital Economics' UK economist Thomas Pugh said the figures added to worries about growth following this week's weak gross domestic product figures for November. ""December's outright fall in retail sales, despite a boost from the lateness of Black Friday, does not bode well for GDP growth in December and could nudge the MPC yet closer still to cutting rates at the end of the month,"" he said.

"This video can not be played Conner Marshall mother: His face was a mass of bruising A coroner has criticised the probation service's ""woefully inadequate"" management of a case worker supervising a man who beat a teenager to death. David Braddon, 26, mistook Conner Marshall, 18, for his estranged partner's former boyfriend. Braddon was jailed for life for Mr Marshall's murder in 2015. In a narrative conclusion at the Pontypridd inquest on Friday, assistant coroner Nadim Bashir said Braddon's case worker was ""overwhelmed"". He described how Kathryn Oakley accepted a number of times she could have done more with the supervision of Braddon. Family 'denied access' to killer's probation report Offender deemed 'low risk' When the attack happened Braddon was under supervision for drug offences and assaulting a police officer. Probation reforms took place in 2014, with privately-run community rehabilitation companies (CRCs) taking on the work. Following this,some staff were behind with their work, the inquest in Pontypridd had heard. Mr Bashir described Braddon's probation officer Ms Oakley as being ""brand new to her role"" after starting in January 2014. ""She should have been supervised by a team manager once every six to eight weeks,"" he said. ""She had weak team managers with no team manager oversight of her case work load. ""The management and supervision of her was woefully inadequate."" David Braddon is serving a life sentence for murder ""The failures, however, must have a direct and clear causal connection with Conner Marshall's death and must contribute in a more than minimal way,"" he added. ""But I am satisfied there was no possible or even probable evidential link that led to Conner Marshall's death. ""Put simply, his death could not have been foreseen or predicted, let alone prevented."" Nadine Marshall spoke at the end of the inquest Following the inquest, Mr Marshall's mother Nadine said his death had followed the ""chaos"" after the privatisation of probation services. ""Today is the culmination of almost five years of struggle to obtain truth and justice for Conner and find out why our much loved son was the victim of a callous and unprovoked attack,"" she said. She added the supervision of Braddon was ""not robust"" and the management system in Wales ""wholly inadequate"". Mrs Marshall said ""we will never know if our son would still be here today"" if things had operated differently. Following the inquest, the trade union for probation and family court staff Napo said it had raised ""serious concerns"" about the firm responsible for probation services in Wales. It said staff had complained about excessive workloads, exacerbated by Working Links' decision to make 40% of staff redundant when it took over operations in 2014. General secretary Ian Lawrence said: ""Time and time again we are seeing our members being scapegoated by management across both the public and private arms of probation when a serious further offence occurs. ""This is especially relevant in this tragic case when there is so much empirical evidence to suggest that Working Links were incapable of running a safe and effective operational model."" He said before Working Links went into administration last year, Napo warned ministers that its contract was ""failing on every level"". National Probation Service Wales director, Ian Barrow, said: ""This was an awful crime and our thoughts remain with Conner Marshall's family and friends. ""While the coroner found Conner's death could not have been avoided, there is no doubt David Braddon's probation supervision was not good enough. ""We have now taken responsibility for managing all offenders on licence in Wales from the Community Rehabilitation Company and 800 more probation officers are in training across England and Wales which will help to improve public protection."" If nothing else, this inquest has highlighted how difficult probation's role is. On a daily basis, officers juggle supervision of a number of people living chaotic lives. Processes are put in place to try and manage that, but in this case the needs of a junior probation service officer weren't adequately supported. Managers were aware she was feeling overwhelmed but an online tool suggested her workload was fine - others were coping, after all. And so somewhere in the midst of a changing structure, the needs of Kathryn Oakley were overlooked. It has taken a coroner looking at the inner workings of a service to see this was ""woefully inadequate"". It is now down to the Ministry of Justice and National Probation Service to give reassurance that the new way of working is different.

"Retail sales fell again in December as a Christmas shopping spree failed to materialise. Sales volumes fell by 0.6% from November, the fifth month in a row without growth,the Office for National Statistics said,external. It comes amid worries about economic growth and forecasts that the Bank of England could cut interest rates soon. Food stores were hard hit, with the quantity bought falling by the biggest amount since December 2016. ""Anecdotal evidence from a number of stores stated that goods did not sell as well as expected,"" the ONS said. The latest figures are published as UK High Streets continue to face tough trading conditions, with big chains such as Mothercare and Thomas Cook going bust in recent months. The December 2019 figures, unlike those for the same month in 2018, include Black Friday sales, but the ONS said it had seasonally adjusted its data to account for this shift. How to save the UK's crisis-hit High Streets Department store Beales warns of collapse risk Trading statements for the Christmas season from the country's biggest supermarkets had already indicated that households spent less on festive fare in 2019 than they had the previous year. Sales at food stores fell 1.3% in December from the previous month, the ONS said. Department stores were also under pressure, with sales down 1.8% month-on-month, as were clothing stores, which saw a 2% fall in sales. This is yet more proof, if it were needed, that December was tough for retailers. The so-called golden quarter was far from sparkling and it's clear that it failed to deliver what many businesses wanted. Black Friday, which came late this year, really has shifted the pattern of spending, with sales simply being pulled forward instead of boosting overall spending. Despite wages now rising faster than inflation, and healthier household finances overall, retail isn't getting its share of spending from disposable income that it once did. But amid the gloom, some retailers have done well by giving customers what they want as well along with selling the right products at the right price. Household goods and fuel were the only sectors that saw an increase. Online sales accounted for 19% of December's retail spending, up from 18.6% the previous month. Last week, the British Retail Consortium said 2019 had beenthe worst year for retailers since 1995. ""The picture we're seeing from trading figures is that shoppers reined in spending in the months ahead of Christmas, with the December monthly figure showing there was no festive bounce to make up for lost ground,"" said Ed Monk, associate director for personal investing at Fidelity International. At the same time, Andrew Carlisle, managing director and UK retail consulting lead at Accenture, struck a more optimistic note. ""While these figures won't dispel concerns around the challenging UK retail climate, the picture is not all doom and gloom,"" he said. ""Consumer confidence rose to its highest since July last month, showing there could be better times ahead in 2020. Retailers will be hoping that an economic bounce and regulatory relief will see an upturn in fortunes."" But Capital Economics' UK economist Thomas Pugh said the figures added to worries about growth following this week's weak gross domestic product figures for November. ""December's outright fall in retail sales, despite a boost from the lateness of Black Friday, does not bode well for GDP growth in December and could nudge the MPC yet closer still to cutting rates at the end of the month,"" he said. A fall in inflation has also raised expectations a rate cut in on the cards. After the retail sales data was released, the pound reversed earlier gains and edged lower, another signal that the financial markets are expecting a rate cut.

"Apple could be forced to abandon its Lightning connector cable if European lawmakers get their way. The cable is used to charge and sync many Apple devices, such as the iPhone. But members of the European Parliament urged the European Commission on Monday to force tech giants to adopt a single universal charging method. Two other charging cables - USB-C and micro-USB - are used on Android devices, and Apple has already stopped using Lightning on the 2018 iPad Pro. European regulators will vote on the matter on a yet to be determined date, but Apple says the proposed regulation would stifle innovation and be disruptive to consumers. If the regulator enforces its proposed regulation, Apple devices sold in Europe would be required to have a new charging method. It is likely Apple would then adopt USB-C, considering the company's 2018 iPad Pro ditched Lightning in favour of the technology. Another possible option would be to remove charging ports and cables entirely and use wireless charging instead. A new cable would mark the tech giant's third in 13 years. The majority of newly-manufactured Android phones already feature USB-C ports. Trump launches fresh attack on Apple over privacy Apple accused of crackdown on jailbreaking The European Commission has been campaigning for a single charging method for the past decade. There were more than 30 types of charger on the market in 2009, but that number has since been reduced to just three. The regulator is determined to cut down on electronic waste being created by obsolete cables, which it estimates generate more than 51,000 tonnes of waste per year. ""This is hugely detrimental for the environment,"" said European Parliament member Alex Agius Saliba. ""A common charger should fit all mobile phones, tablets, e-book readers and other portable devices."" Apple, along with 10 other leading tech giants such as Nokia and Samsung, signed a memorandum of understanding in 2009. They pledged to provide micro-USB compatible chargers for consumers. However, Apple took advantage of a loophole that allowed manufacturers to continue using their own chargers if they offered an adaptor. Then, in 2014, the EU passed the Radio Equipment Directive, which called for a ""renewed effort to develop a common charger"". Apple insisted that its slimmer devices would be unable to fit the then-new USB-C technology, and it claimed it would cost up to $2bn (Â£1.53bn) to meet the desired standard. Apple and many of its rivals, such as Huawei and Samsung, have already released products that charge their devices wirelessly. Although the technology is in its infancy, new developments have meant that it is now able to compete with traditional charging methods. Some analysts are even predicting thatApple could scrap its charging ports altogether,externalby releasing future iPhone and iPad models that rely solely on wireless charging.

"Wu Huayan ate only rice and chillies in order to save money to help her sick brother Anger is increasing in China after it was revealed only a fraction of the million yuan ($144,000; Â£111,000) donated to a severely malnourished student reached her before her death. People across the country had given money to help Wu Huayan, whose plight emerged after she was taken to hospital with breathing difficulties last autumn. The student, who weighed little more than 20kg (43lb), had been surviving on pennies a day for five years. She later explained how she had watched both her father and grandmother die because they did not have enough money for medical care. She was determined not to let the same happen to her, with the media appeal her last chance. And it appeared to work: the donations flooded in. But it wasn't enough to save Wu, who died on Monday aged 24. Those who had been rooting for her were devastated, but there was worse to come. It transpired the money they had given - or at least the vast majority of it - never reached Wy Huayan. Official records seem to suggest just 20,000 yuan ($2,900; Â£2,225) was paid towards her hospital bills. It has left many asking: how on earth did the system let this young woman down - and who exactly is to blame? The first pictures of Wu Huayan - her 135cm (4ft 5ins) visibly emaciated - were released in October. She and her brother, who is understood to have mental health issues, had been relying on an uncle and aunt for support, but they could only provide 300 yuan ($43.60; Â£33.45) each month. After her brother's medical bills, there was only two yuan a day left for Miss Wu's food. Immediately, people began to donate. The money was collected by Charity 9958, a project under the China Charities Aid Foundation for Children (CCAFC), using two different funding platforms. It was meant to help pay for heart surgery. The fundraising page drew in tens of thousands of yuan But it never happened. According to reports, Miss Wu never gained enough weight to undergo the operation. According to official media, she weighed less than 30kg when she died. Within days of her death, a scandal began to emerge. A state-media outlet called The Cover accused 9958 of running ""a deadly scam"". Zheng Hehong, a prominent activist and former member of staff at 9958, came out alleging the charity sought out particularly ill or vulnerable people, and then withheld funds as part of a ploy to keep the proceeds as long as possible. ""They waited until the patient died so they could take the interest income,"" she told Phoenix New Media's Ifeng.com. ""This income, by law, can be given as a staff bonus instead of charitable aid."" Chinese boy with frozen hair reignites poverty debate Where film stars and police chiefs can simply vanish Former top Chinese official jailed for life But the charity has hit back, saying it was holding onto the money on her family's request. They said it had not been paid because she had not met the criteria needed to undergo the surgery - and that it had planned to release the funds afterwards. However, one acquaintance told The Cover that Ms Wu didn't even know about 400,000 yuan of the money. Miss Wu arrived in hospital with breathing difficulties Then, further complications: 9958 said it had stopped raising donations for Miss Wu after local government officials said that they would ""take care"" of the third year university student and her family. The town has denied this, saying they had not been in contact with 9958. But is it all as simple as that? There have been a series of high profile scandals involving Chinese charities in recent years, journalist David Paulk points out in a Twitter thread. They include charities set up to help girls but which gave money to boys, and one which used duplicate photos as it encouraged people to donate to impoverished children,the news editor of Sixth Tone explained in a Twitter thread,external. But conversely, the CCAFC - the parent body of 9958 - was named China's most transparent charity in 2019 ""achieving a perfect score of 100"". Pictures of eight-year-old Little Wang were shared tens of thousands of times Regardless, BBC Monitoring's Kerry Allen says that China's official media have acknowledged that there has been ""chaos and confusion"" in China's charity industry. The official China Daily says that there are ""too many overlapping authorities and liabilities"", and called for better regulation, saying thatonline charity fraud has become rife.,external The publicity surrounding stories like Ms Wu's has also left charities wary of taking on similar cases, for fear the repercussions of being blamed for not doing enough. The South China Morning Post noted that Wang Fuman, an impoverished schoolboy who touched the nation's hearts after a picture of him with frost in his hair went viral, had been granted a happy ending by being offered a place at a private school. However,it was later retracted,externalbecause the school could not cope with ""the intense extra scrutiny from the authorities and pressure from the media"". How the country became the world's 'economic miracle' The deep cuts of 70 years of Communist rule China's government media has also been wary about the potential of families exploiting their children for online fame and donations. Wang Fuman's father told Inkstone News that funds donated to his son were withheld amid allegations the family were being ""greedy"" and distributed to other ""ice boys"".""Our family only received a small amount of money,"" he told the site,external. But reports contradicting a ""happy ending"" in such cases have never reached mainland China, where media is heavily regulated. Consequently, Ms Wu's death has angered social media users in the country, and led to suspicions that local governments are taking a cut of charity funds for themselves. Many have noted scandals whereformer officials in the impoverished region have been able to live a life of excess,external. This video can not be played China's uphill struggle fighting extreme poverty The government are likely to be keen to shift any blame away from their officials, as they have been working hard to paint them in more positive light and point towards successes in poverty alleviation. China's Communist Party has said it wants to eradicate extreme poverty by the end of 2020, trumpeting success in places like Jiangsu province - which claimsit has just 17 people living in poverty. Stories like that of Ms Wu and her little brother, then, are not what it wants to see making headlines.

"This video can not be played The BBC's Martin Patience says Ayatollah Ali Khamenei delivered a ""defiant message"" Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has defended the country's armed forces after it admitted shooting down a passenger plane by mistake. He said the Revolutionary Guard - the elite unit responsible for the disaster - ""maintained the security"" of Iran. Widespread protests and criticism from abroad have put growing pressure on Iran over its handling of the incident. But the ayatollah tried to rally support as he led Friday prayers in Tehran for the first time since 2012. The Ukraine International Airlines Boeing 737-800 was travelling to Kyiv from Tehran on 8 January when it crashed shortly after take-off. All 176 passengers on board, including nationals from Iran, Canada, Sweden and the UK, were killed. The ayatollah called for ""national unity"" and said Iran's ""enemies"" - a reference to Washington and its allies - had used the shooting down of the plane to overshadow the killing of senior Iranian general Qasem Soleimani in a US drone strike. ""Our enemies were as happy about the plane crash as we were sad,"" he said. ""[They were] happy that they had found something to question the Guard and the armed forces."" Canada offers funds to families of victims Iran faces watershed moment Plane crash victims 'were the best of us' What we know about flight PS752 The Iranian authorities initially denied responsibility but, after international pressure mounted, the Revolutionary Guard admitted that the plane had been mistaken for a ""cruise missile"" during heightened tensions with the US. Hours before it was shot down, and in response to the killing of Soleimani, Iranian missiles targeted two airbases in Iraq that housed US forces. Washington initially said no US troops had been injured, but it later reported that 11 people had been treated for concussion after they showed symptoms days after the missile strikes. Ayatollah Khamenei, 80, addressed the nation from the Mosalla mosque in the capital. The last time he did so was in 2012 on the 33rd anniversary of the country's Islamic Revolution. Leading Friday prayers in the capital is a symbolically significant act usually reserved for times when Iran's highest authority wishes to deliver an important message, says Mehdi Khalaji of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. Historically, Iranian leaders have left this task to loyal clerics with strong oratorical skills, he adds. Thousands of Iranians chanted slogans beneath portraits of Qasem Soleimani As well as defending the military, the ayatollah: Criticised the ""evil"" administration of US President Donald Trump, whom he called a ""clown"" Accused Washington of ""lying"" when it expressed support for the Iranian people, and said the US would ""stab them with their poison dagger"" Said the Iranian missile strikes in Iraq were a ""slap on the face"" to the US Described Iran's elite Quds Force - which the US has designated a terrorist organisation - as a ""humanitarian organisation with human values"" Called Soleimani's funeral and the Iranian military response a ""turning point in history"" Lambasted the ""evil"" British government, along with Germany and France, for triggering the formal dispute mechanism over the 2015 nuclear deal In response, the US government's Special Representative for Iran, Brian Hook, said Iran would remain isolated ""as long as the regime threatens the world"". Analysis by Kasra Naji, BBC Persian This sermon was an effort from Iran's supreme leader - who has come under heavy criticism in recent days - to defend his rule. He delivered part of his address in Arabic, calling on the Arab and Islamic world to drive the US out of the region. ""The biggest punishment for the United States is its expulsion,"" he said. But his more immediate aim was to shore up his government after the Ukrainian passenger plane was shot down. The episode has weakened Ayatollah Khamenei's position at home. There have been protests up and down the country, with demonstrators shouting slogans and calling on him to step down. Today, the ayatollah accused the protesters of being influenced by foreign-based media. He also praised the Revolutionary Guard for bringing security to the country. But, ultimately, he seemed to have little new to say. As a result, he is unlikely to have won much support for the policies he has been pursuing. Many in Iran had hoped the ayatollah would change course and admit past mistakes. That was far from the case. Canadian Foreign Minister FranÃ§ois-Philippe Champagne is due to meet his Iranian counterpart, Javad Zarif, in Muscat, Oman, to discuss the investigation. Speaking on Friday,Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced interim compensationof C$25,000 (Â£14,700) per victim for the families of Canadian citizens or permanent residents killed in the crash. He said Canada expected Iran to financially compensate all the families of the victims. ""I have met them and they can't wait weeks. They need support now,"" he told reporters in Ottawa. It comes a day after Mr Champagne held talks in London with ministers of four other nations that lost citizens in the crash. This video can not be played Footage shows missile strike on Ukrainian plane in Iran Speaking on behalf of the group, he said on Thursday: ""We are here to pursue closure, accountability, transparency and justice for the victims - Ukrainian, Swedish, Afghan, British, Canadian as well as Iranian, through a full, complete and transparent international investigation.""

"Retail sales fell again in December as a Christmas shopping spree failed to materialise. Sales volumes fell by 0.6% from November, the fifth month in a row without growth,the Office for National Statistics said,external. It comes amid worries about economic growth and forecasts that the Bank of England could cut interest rates soon. Food stores were hard hit, with the quantity bought falling by the biggest amount since December 2016. ""Anecdotal evidence from a number of stores stated that goods did not sell as well as expected,"" the ONS said. The latest figures are published as UK High Streets continue to face tough trading conditions, with big chains such as Mothercare and Thomas Cook going bust in recent months. The December 2019 figures, unlike those for the same month in 2018, include Black Friday sales, but the ONS said it had seasonally adjusted its data to account for this shift. How to save the UK's crisis-hit High Streets Department store Beales warns of collapse risk Trading statements for the Christmas season from the country's biggest supermarkets had already indicated that households spent less on festive fare in 2019 than they had the previous year. Sales at food stores fell 1.3% in December from the previous month, the ONS said. Department stores were also under pressure, with sales down 1.8% month-on-month, as were clothing stores, which saw a 2% fall in sales. This is yet more proof, if it were needed, that December was tough for retailers. The so-called golden quarter was far from sparkling and it's clear that it failed to deliver what many businesses wanted. Black Friday, which came late this year, really has shifted the pattern of spending, with sales simply being pulled forward instead of boosting overall spending. Despite wages now rising faster than inflation, and healthier household finances overall, retail isn't getting its share of spending from disposable income that it once did. But amid the gloom, some retailers have done well by giving customers what they want as well along with selling the right products at the right price. Household goods and fuel were the only sectors that saw an increase. Online sales accounted for 19% of December's retail spending, up from 18.6% the previous month. Last week, the British Retail Consortium said 2019 had beenthe worst year for retailers since 1995. ""The picture we're seeing from trading figures is that shoppers reined in spending in the months ahead of Christmas, with the December monthly figure showing there was no festive bounce to make up for lost ground,"" said Ed Monk, associate director for personal investing at Fidelity International. At the same time, Andrew Carlisle, managing director and UK retail consulting lead at Accenture, struck a more optimistic note. ""While these figures won't dispel concerns around the challenging UK retail climate, the picture is not all doom and gloom,"" he said. ""Consumer confidence rose to its highest since July last month, showing there could be better times ahead in 2020. Retailers will be hoping that an economic bounce and regulatory relief will see an upturn in fortunes."" But Capital Economics' UK economist Thomas Pugh said the figures added to worries about growth following this week's weak gross domestic product figures for November. ""December's outright fall in retail sales, despite a boost from the lateness of Black Friday, does not bode well for GDP growth in December and could nudge the MPC yet closer still to cutting rates at the end of the month,"" he said. A fall in inflation has also raised expectations a rate cut in on the cards. After the retail sales data was released, the pound reversed earlier gains and edged lower, another signal that the financial markets are expecting a rate cut.

"At least 5,000 children seeking special educational needs support (Send) are to have their cases reviewed after a London council landed a stinging rebuke from the local government ombudsman. Concerns about ""systemic failures"" in Richmond's Send department prompted the watchdog to take the highly unusual step of ordering the full-scale audit. The ombudsman found missing documents, mislabelled files and protocols ignored while looking into three complaints. Richmond accepted the findings in full. The council which is usually found in the higher end of the education league tables, has agreed to undertake the review of its provision, which is run by an external company, Achieving for Children (AfC). The watchdog's decision to act reflects the seriousness of the situation which its investigation uncovered. Michael King, local government and social care ombudsman, said the cases gave rise to serious concerns that there may be systemic failures within the processes operated by Richmond Council and AfC. ""I have published this report, in part, because other families may very well be affected by issues similar to those I have raised. I have now asked the council to undertake a full audit of its education provision and report back to me about what it finds,"" he said. ""If the council finds other children have been affected, it should take steps to ensure they do not miss out on the services they are entitled to receive by law."" The review will initially focus on the 1,500 children who are currently on education, health and care (EHC) plans. However, a further 3,500 are on the plans outside the council area, or are on some kind of special needs support. Their provision will need to be checked to see if others were being denied services to which they were entitled. There could be hundreds more families who are in the process of seeking special needs support, covering emotional and mental health needs, learning needs as well as disabilities, whose cases will need to be checked. Richmond has three months to complete the audit and six months to submit it to the ombudsman. Special needs 'breaking county council budgets' Special needs shortfalls 'causing misery' Special needs system in crisis - ombudsman When the ombudsman's investigators visited the council to inspect case files, they found documents missing, filed or named incorrectly, and protocols not being followed. The safe keeping of documents is important because families can take months to obtain reports and assessments from professionals to justify the special needs support they are seeking. The investigation found the council had three separate IT systems for managing information, one of which could only be accessed by a single member of staff. And in one of the cases, the ombudsman's investigation was only able to discover what had happened because the family had kept thorough records. Not only was support delayed and not provided for the children and young people involved in the ombudsman cases, statutory deadlines were missed. In addition, the education and wellbeing of young people suffered, and in some cases children were out of school for long periods. Communication and case management was poor, with records being incomplete and vague, and a great deal of stress was caused to the families involved. One family was awarded more than Â£9,000 for the loss of a year's education, inadequate provision and in recompense for time, trouble and distress caused. And in the third case a family had to pay for its own education psychologist report at a cost of Â£4,400. Many local authorities have struggled with changes ushered in by new legislation in 2014 which changed the way special needs are assessed and met. The Commons Education Select Committee said in its report in October that children were being let down ""day after day"" as their parents faced a ""titanic struggle"" to get the support they need. Ian Dodds, director of children's services for Richmond Council, said the report shows that there were significant failings for some children and young people. ""This does not reflect what I want to see in place for every child and young person,"" he said. ""Our sincerest apologies have been extended to the families of the children and young people the ombudsman has reported on."" He added that much had been achieved and significant investment was being made locally and that there was new leadership at the council. Richmond said it had improved its record-keeping system, was investing in a single administrative system and had increased investment in Send over the past few years. It added that it has speeded up its processing of EHC plans and had appointed internal cross-council auditors to carry out the review of cases. The council is also seeking feedback from new parent forums on the process of obtaining special needs support.

"China's economy grew last year at the slowest pace in almost three decades. Official figures show that the world's second largest economy expanded by 6.1% in 2019 from the year before - the worst figure in 29 years. The country has faced weak domestic demand and the impact of the bitter trade war with the US. The government has been rolling out measures over the past two years in an attempt to boost growth. It comes after almost two years of trade tensions with the US - although hopes of a better relationship with America have seen improvements in manufacturing and business confidence data. This week Washington and Beijing signed a ""phase one"" trade deal. However, analysts remain unsure whether those recent gains will continue. In response to the lower growth rate, Beijing is now widely expected to roll out yet more stimulus measures. US-China trade war in 300 words US-China trade deal: Winners and losers US-China trade war in 300 words The government has used a combination of measures aimed at easing the slowdown, including tax cuts and allowing local governments to sell large amounts of bonds to fund their infrastructure programmes. The country's banks have also been encouraged to lend more, especially to small firms. New loans in the local currency hit a record high of $2.44 trillion (Â£1.86tn) last year. This video can not be played How the US-China trade war has changed the world So far the economy has been slow to pick up, with investment growth falling to record low levels. Historically, China has seen much stronger economic expansion, with the first decade of the 21st Century seeing double-digit percentage growth. But - although that 6.1% growth rate is China's weakest expansion in almost three decades - it is much higher than other leading economies. The US central bank, for example, has forecast that the American economy will grow by around 2.2% this year. Analysis by Stephen McDonell, BBC China correspondent For many countries, having the slowest GDP growth in three decades might cause panic - but not in China. Softening domestic demand and US tariffs have eaten into growth - but some analysts argue that the trade war may have actually helped the Chinese economy. This 6.1% GDP figure for 2019 is not only within the government's target range, but Chinese policy makers have for years been trying to gradually step down expectations. They're trying to break away from the years of unsustainable breakneck growth which has trashed the natural environment and led to an explosion in unserviceable debt. The government has instigated some stimulus measures to make sure the steam doesn't come out of the economy too quickly. But on bank loans, the crucial question will be - who gets access to the loans? Will it be those building the ""bridge to nowhere"" vanity projects which have popped up in many regional cities? Or will it be the promising new start-up enterprises which are seen as the future of modern Chinese development? As part of the phase one deal, China pledged to boost US imports by $200bn above 2017 levels and strengthen intellectual property rules. In exchange, the US agreed to halve some of the new tariffs it has imposed on Chinese products. Speaking in Washington, US President Donald Trump said the pact would be ""transformative"" for the American economy.

"The boss of Flybe has confirmed the airline is in talks with the government over a loan, but says the financial support would not constitute a bailout. Mark Anderson told Flybe staff the firm had had a few ""difficult days"" this week but it still had ""a great future"". He said the company's turnaround plan had started to work and that with more time it would be making a big profit. Rival airlines have called for more details of the government's role in helping Flybe to be made public. They argue that support for the troubled regional carrier may contravene competition rules. Ryanair boss threatens legal action over Flybe 'Valuable connectivity': Why Flybe matters Flybe to move Newquay-Heathrow flights to Gatwick Mr Anderson, whose address to staff was also carried over videolink and has been seen by the BBC, said the government recognised the airline's vital role in connecting far flung parts of the UK and wanted to help the firm thrive. ""We are in conversation with the government around a financial loan - a loan, not a bailout - a commercial loan, but that is the same as any loan we'd take from any bank,"" he said. According to state aid rules the loan would need to either be short term and aimed at rescuing and restructuring the business or it would have to be provided on the same terms a private lender such as a bank would offer. ""The government will not lend if they do not believe there is a credible plan. No-one is going to throw good money after bad,"" Mr Anderson said. Mr Anderson said he wanted to address speculation over the firm's future. He said the company had had ""legacy issues"" to deal with that had not been apparent to the group of investors led by Virgin Atlantic who bought the airline early last year. Mark Anderson addressed Flybe staff to explain events of the last few days ""Our shareholders invested an awful lot of money, believing they fully understood the state of the business they'd bought,"" he said. ""The realityâ¦ is that we were in worse shape than even the shareholders thought we were. ""We went into the summer very unresilient in terms of our operation, with a weak fleet, with a lot of gaps in terms of people flying our aircraft, with huge payments being made to people to get them to work extra hours."" A combination of higher costs, late flights, and compensation for delayed passengers meant the firm was losing money ""hand over fist"" for a time, he said. ""Three-quarters of the money the shareholders invested was gone before we even really started. That has hurt this business and more money is needed."" However, he said by the beginning of January Flybe's turnaround plan was working, with sales ahead of expectations. ""We are in a vastly different place than where we were six months ago,"" he said. ""We are not making millions of profit at the moment but if we stick to the plan, and what we have to do, we will,"" he said. He admitted this week's news coverage had dented sales but said he believed customers would return quickly. But he said that there was a risk of a ""self-fulfilling prophesy"" if people kept talking the company down. On Thursday, the boss of rival carrier Ryanair described the government's intervention to support Flybe as a ""badly thought-out bailout of a chronically loss-making airline"". Michael O'Leary, sent a strongly worded letter to Chancellor Sajid Javid in which he argued any measures that were being put in place to help Flybe should be extended to other airlines. ""We must be treated the same as Flybe if fair competition is to exist,"" he wrote. He said if that were not the case Ryanair would consider taking legal action. British Airways' owner IAG has already filed a complaint with the EU, arguing the rescue may breach state aid rules and has filed a Freedom of Information request for more details about the plan. The government has not published the details of what it has discussed with Flybe, although it has said it is fully compliant with state aid rules. The government's support is thought to centre on giving the airline extra time to pay about Â£100m of outstanding Air Passenger Duty (APD). Flybe's owners Richard Branson's Virgin Atlantic, Stobart Group and Cyrus Capital have agreed to invest Â£30m into the airline. Stobart Group said it would provide Â£9m of capital ""with the funds drawn down only if required"".

"Specially fitted electric taxis will be able to charge while they wait for a fare Wireless charging for electric taxis waiting in their rank is to be trialled in Nottingham. The government is putting Â£3.4m towards fitting five charging plates outside the city's railway station. The six-month pilot project will see 10 electric taxis fitted with the necessary hardware and the scheme could be rolled out if successful. Officials said electric vehicles were ""vital"" to improving city air quality and making charging convenient was key. The Department for Transport said wireless charging was more convenient and avoided the clutter of cable charging points. Standard charging points involve cables and large power points There was also the potential for the technology to be made available for public use, it added. Andrea Leadsom, Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, said: ""Charging technology, including wireless, is vital in giving consumers confidence to make the switch from petrol to electric cars. ""This pioneering trial in Nottingham, and others like it, will help us take crucial steps towards lower emissions and cleaner air. ""We are determined to end our contribution to global warming entirely by 2050 - and delivering cleaner and greener transport systems is a key part of this"". Sally Longford, deputy leader at Nottingham City Council, said: ""Nottingham is excited to host the trial of this new type of innovative charging technology, keeping us ahead of the pack, and helping to promote cleaner taxis in our city and potentially take us a further step forward towards our goal of being carbon neutral by 2028."" The vehicles will be owned by the council and provided rent-free to drivers. No date has been fixed for the project to start, though the city council said it hoped it would be ""later this year"". The council already runs a ""try before you buy"" scheme for electric taxis, alongside financial support for purchases.

Local authorities are responsible for public CCTV as it not only records and monitors crime, but also issues like parking, litter, traffic and town centre management. But in recent yearssome councils have cutsurveillance spending in an attempt to save millions, and more proposals are being considered as they prepare to set their budgets for the next financial year. Drug and crime fears for vulnerable teens Rising knife crime linked to council cuts, study suggests Plastic pint glasses to real-time CCTV In Caerphilly,the authority is considering switching off 26 of its public CCTV cameras,external, while in Neath Port Talbot the authority is proposing reducing how much it pays for cameras by getting the commercial sector to make up any shortfall to ensure there will be no reduction in CCTV service across the authority area. Meanwhile in Bridgend, proposals to turn off 92 cameras that monitor traffic and help prevent crime, have been put onhold after the Welsh Government increased funding for councils. But the cuts could resurface in 2021-22 when a potential Â£370,000 cut is proposed. This video can not be played CCTV footage shows a police van chasing Ford's car, and later the vehicle crashing into the shelter Chief Prosecutor for the Welsh Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), Barry Hughes has said public and private CCTV was ""valuable"" when making difficult charging decisions. Back in 2017, a man who raped a woman while she was sleeping at Bridgend bus station,was only caught after CCTV operators spotted the incident and raised the alarm with police. The victim had no recollection of the attack but camera operators raised the alarm and he was arrested nearby. And in 2015, CCTV showed the moment a driver crashed into a smoking shelter at a nightclub inPorthcawl, Bridgend, during a police chase, seriously injuring six people. Criminal barrister Andrew Taylor said CCTV had been used to track down and convict paedophiles. He said it had been used in cases to pinpoint defendants at the scene of a crime, where chances of a conviction would have been ""tiny"" without the footage. ""This is a very important weapon in the armoury that police and investigators have in bringing people to justice,"" he said. ""Nobody tonight and this week is going to sleep safer in their beds if we start taking down CCTV."" Prof Shepherd pioneered the Cardiff Model, a scheme for reducing alcohol related violence which has been adopted across the world Prof Shepherd, research director at Cardiff University's Violence Research Group, said having real-time monitored CCTV cameras in town centres allowed police to get to rows before they escalated. The former facial surgeon, who has treated people with broken cheek bones and missing teeth after fights, said he feared more people would be seriously injured if cameras were switched off. Prof Shepherd said while CCTV did act as a deterrent to some crime, most people were drunk or on drugs and were not aware that they were being watched by cameras at the time of an attack. ""As night follows day, the hospitals are going to see an increase in serious injuries,"" he said. ""It is completely irresponsible for a local authority to turn off CCTV, public safety and safety of the people they care for and provide services for should be a top priority."" This video can not be played CCTV shows a tow rope being used to loosen the free-standing machine inside the store and pulling it out Victim Support said without CCTV vulnerable people would be put at risk in town centres, and less people would be caught for crimes. Alex Mayes, policy and public affairs lead, said: ""It is vital that victims of crime are able to utilise evidence that can support their cases, otherwise their access to justice may be hindered."" But South Wales Police and Crime Commissioner (PCC) Alun Michael said rather than cuts, the force was in talks with councils about how to get better quality CCTV and to make better use of the services. ""In some local authorities the kit is extremely out of date, it does not have sufficient high resolution for evidence,"" he said. ""I am confident we are not going to see the wholesale abolition of CCTV."" This video can not be played Ramson was given a 12 month ban after admitting dangerous driving He said while councils were facing pressures it was important that the coverage and quality of CCTV did not deteriorate as it acted as a deterrent and could be key for securing convictions. Gwent PCC Jeff Cuthbert said it was a ""great shame that councils are being obliged to consider making such cuts"". A Caerphilly council spokesman said the authority currently monitors 153 cameras around the clock, but was considering turning some off due to ""significant financial pressures"". ""These savings proposals are currently our for public consultation and we will carefully consider the feedback we get from residents before making any final decision,"" he said. A Neath Port Talbot council spokesman said: ""Work is at an advanced stage to develop the current CCTV operating model in a way in which new income can be secured to sustain and if possible enhance the CCTV service into future years. ""There are no proposals to cut the service further."" Extra funding to tackle violent crime rise Counties set to share CCTV monitoring Should we be worried by ever more CCTV cameras?

"China's economy grew last year at the slowest pace in almost three decades. Official figures show that the world's second largest economy expanded by 6.1% in 2019 from the year before - the worst figure in 29 years. The country has faced weak domestic demand and the impact of the bitter trade war with the US. The government has been rolling out measures over the past two years in an attempt to boost growth. It comes after almost two years of trade tensions with the US - although hopes of a better relationship with America have seen improvements in manufacturing and business confidence data. This week Washington and Beijing signed a ""phase one"" trade deal. However, analysts remain unsure whether those recent gains will continue. In response to the lower growth rate, Beijing is now widely expected to roll out yet more stimulus measures. US-China trade war in 300 words US-China trade deal: Winners and losers US-China trade war in 300 words The government has used a combination of measures aimed at easing the slowdown, including tax cuts and allowing local governments to sell large amounts of bonds to fund their infrastructure programmes. The country's banks have also been encouraged to lend more, especially to small firms. New loans in the local currency hit a record high of $2.44 trillion (Â£1.86tn) last year. This video can not be played How the US-China trade war has changed the world So far the economy has been slow to pick up, with investment growth falling to record low levels. Historically, China has seen much stronger economic expansion, with the first decade of the 21st Century seeing double-digit percentage growth. But - although that 6.1% growth rate is China's weakest expansion in almost three decades - it is much higher than other leading economies. The US central bank, for example, has forecast that the American economy will grow by around 2.2% this year. Analysis by Stephen McDonell, BBC China correspondent For many countries, having the slowest GDP growth in three decades might cause panic - but not in China. Softening domestic demand and US tariffs have eaten into growth - but some analysts argue that the trade war may have actually helped the Chinese economy. This 6.1% GDP figure for 2019 is not only within the government's target range, but Chinese policy makers have for years been trying to gradually step down expectations. They're trying to break away from the years of unsustainable breakneck growth which has trashed the natural environment and led to an explosion in unserviceable debt. The government has instigated some stimulus measures to make sure the steam doesn't come out of the economy too quickly. But on bank loans, the crucial question will be - who gets access to the loans? Will it be those building the ""bridge to nowhere"" vanity projects which have popped up in many regional cities? Or will it be the promising new start-up enterprises which are seen as the future of modern Chinese development? As part of the phase one deal, China pledged to boost US imports by $200bn above 2017 levels and strengthen intellectual property rules. In exchange, the US agreed to halve some of the new tariffs it has imposed on Chinese products. Speaking in Washington, US President Donald Trump said the pact would be ""transformative"" for the American economy.

"This video can not be played The BBC's Martin Patience says Ayatollah Ali Khamenei delivered a ""defiant message"" Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has defended the country's armed forces after it admitted shooting down a passenger plane by mistake. He said the Revolutionary Guard - the elite unit responsible for the disaster - ""maintained the security"" of Iran. Widespread protests and criticism from abroad have put growing pressure on Iran over its handling of the incident. But the ayatollah tried to rally support as he led Friday prayers in Tehran for the first time since 2012. The Ukraine International Airlines Boeing 737-800 was travelling to Kyiv from Tehran on 8 January when it crashed shortly after take-off. All 176 passengers on board, including nationals from Iran, Canada, Sweden and the UK, were killed. The ayatollah called for ""national unity"" and said Iran's ""enemies"" - a reference to Washington and its allies - had used the shooting down of the plane to overshadow the killing of senior Iranian general Qasem Soleimani in a US drone strike. ""Our enemies were as happy about the plane crash as we were sad,"" he said. ""[They were] happy that they had found something to question the Guard and the armed forces."" Canada offers funds to families of victims Iran faces watershed moment Plane crash victims 'were the best of us' What we know about flight PS752 The Iranian authorities initially denied responsibility but, after international pressure mounted, the Revolutionary Guard admitted that the plane had been mistaken for a ""cruise missile"" during heightened tensions with the US. Hours before it was shot down, and in response to the killing of Soleimani, Iranian missiles targeted two airbases in Iraq that housed US forces. Washington initially said no US troops had been injured, but it later reported that 11 people had been treated for concussion after they showed symptoms days after the missile strikes. Ayatollah Khamenei, 80, addressed the nation from the Mosalla mosque in the capital. The last time he did so was in 2012 on the 33rd anniversary of the country's Islamic Revolution. Leading Friday prayers in the capital is a symbolically significant act usually reserved for times when Iran's highest authority wishes to deliver an important message, says Mehdi Khalaji of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. Historically, Iranian leaders have left this task to loyal clerics with strong oratorical skills, he adds. Thousands of Iranians chanted slogans beneath portraits of Qasem Soleimani As well as defending the military, the ayatollah: Criticised the ""evil"" administration of US President Donald Trump, whom he called a ""clown"" Accused Washington of ""lying"" when it expressed support for the Iranian people, and said the US would ""stab them with their poison dagger"" Said the Iranian missile strikes in Iraq were a ""slap on the face"" to the US Described Iran's elite Quds Force - which the US has designated a terrorist organisation - as a ""humanitarian organisation with human values"" Called Soleimani's funeral and the Iranian military response a ""turning point in history"" Lambasted the ""evil"" British government, along with Germany and France, for triggering the formal dispute mechanism over the 2015 nuclear deal In response, the US government's Special Representative for Iran, Brian Hook, said Iran would remain isolated ""as long as the regime threatens the world"". Analysis by Kasra Naji, BBC Persian This sermon was an effort from Iran's supreme leader - who has come under heavy criticism in recent days - to defend his rule. He delivered part of his address in Arabic, calling on the Arab and Islamic world to drive the US out of the region. ""The biggest punishment for the United States is its expulsion,"" he said. But his more immediate aim was to shore up his government after the Ukrainian passenger plane was shot down. The episode has weakened Ayatollah Khamenei's position at home. There have been protests up and down the country, with demonstrators shouting slogans and calling on him to step down. Today, the ayatollah accused the protesters of being influenced by foreign-based media. He also praised the Revolutionary Guard for bringing security to the country. But, ultimately, he seemed to have little new to say. As a result, he is unlikely to have won much support for the policies he has been pursuing. Many in Iran had hoped the ayatollah would change course and admit past mistakes. That was far from the case. Canadian Foreign Minister FranÃ§ois-Philippe Champagne is due to meet his Iranian counterpart, Javad Zarif, in Muscat, Oman, to discuss the investigation. Speaking on Friday,Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced interim compensationof C$25,000 (Â£14,700) per victim for the families of Canadian citizens or permanent residents killed in the crash. He said Canada expected Iran to financially compensate all the families of the victims. ""I have met them and they can't wait weeks. They need support now,"" he told reporters in Ottawa. It comes a day after Mr Champagne held talks in London with ministers of four other nations that lost citizens in the crash. This video can not be played Footage shows missile strike on Ukrainian plane in Iran Speaking on behalf of the group, he said on Thursday: ""We are here to pursue closure, accountability, transparency and justice for the victims - Ukrainian, Swedish, Afghan, British, Canadian as well as Iranian, through a full, complete and transparent international investigation.""

"Satya Nadella said that technology built without principles does more harm than good Microsoft has pledged to remove ""all of the carbon"" from the environment that it has emitted since the company was founded in 1975. Chief executive Satya Nadella said he wanted to achieve the goal by 2050 . To do so, the company aims to become ""carbon negative"" by 2030, removing more carbon from the environment than it emits. That goes beyond a pledge by its cloud-computing rival Amazon, which intends to go ""carbon neutral"" by 2040. ""When it comes to carbon, neutrality is not enough,"" said Microsoft president Brad Smith. ""The carbon in our atmosphere has created a blanket of gas that traps heat and is changing the world's climate,""he added in a blog,external. ""If we don't curb emissions, and temperatures continue to climb, science tells us that the results will be catastrophic."" The company also announced it was setting up a $1bn (Â£765m) climate innovation fund to develop carbon-tackling technologies. When a business says it iscarbon neutral, it aims to effectively add no carbon to the atmosphere. It can do this by: balancing its emissions, for example by removing a tonne of carbon from the atmosphere for every tonne it has produced offsetting its emissions, for example by investing in projects that reduce emissions elsewhere in the world not releasing greenhouse gases in the first place, for example by switching to renewable energy sources Until now, most companies have focused on offsetting emissions to achieve neutrality. This often involves funding projects in developing economies to reduce carbon emissions there, for example building hydroelectric power plants, encouraging families to stop using wood-based stoves, and helping businesses make use of solar power. These reductions are then deducted from the main company's own output. The result of this slows carbon emissions rather than reversing them. To becarbon negativea company must actually remove more carbon from the atmosphere than it emits. Microsoft says it will do this using a range of carbon capture and storage technologies. The announcement was largely welcomed by environmentalists, who said it showed Microsoft was thinking about the bigger climate change picture and not just its own role. ""It's a hat trick of sustainability leadership,"" said Elizabeth Sturcken from the Environmental Defence Fund. ""But to really shift the needle on climate change, we need 1,000 other [companies] to follow-suit and turn rhetoric into action."" However, Greenpeace warned that Microsoft still needed to address its ongoing relationship with oil and gas companies. ""While there is a lot to celebrate in Microsoft's announcement, a gaping hole remains unaddressed: Microsoft's expanding efforts to help fossil fuel companies drill more oil and gas with machine-learning and other AI technologies,"" said senior campaigner Elizabeth Jardim. British power plant promises to go carbon negative by 2030 Old oil rigs could become CO2 storage sites Turning carbon dioxide into cash Microsoft's plan is still more aggressive than those taken by other tech firms, including Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon, which have not made ""carbon negative"" commitments. Microsoft has suggested a range of ways it could remove carbon from the atmosphere, including: seeding new forestsand expanding existing ones soil carbon sequestration- a process of putting carbon back into the ground. This could be achieved by adding microbes and nutrients to parched earth, which should have the added benefits of making the soil more fertile and less susceptible to erosion direct air capture- sucking carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere, possibly by using large fans to move air through a filter that can remove the gas bio-energy with carbon capture- growing crops and then capturing the CO2 they emit when, for example, they are burned to produce heat or fermented to make fuels such as bioethanol. Negative emissions become possible if the amount of CO2 stored as a result is greater than that emitted during production, transport and use Tech companies' manufacturing and data-processing centres create large amounts of carbon dioxide. By one estimate,external, the sector will account for up to 3.6% of the world's greenhouse gas emissions this year, more than double the level in 2007. And it has been forecast that in a worst-case scenario, this could grow to 14% by 2040. Microsoft has said it plans to halve emissions created directly by itself and those involved in its supply chain by 2030. One way the company intends to do this is by increasing the carbon fees it charges its internal business groups. Since 2012, Microsoft has forced its divisions to set budgets that take account of the cost of emissions created through electricity use, business travel and other activities. Now that charge will incorporate indirect emissions such as those created by customers using electricity to power the divisions' products. And since Microsoft cannot avoid producing CO2 altogether, it will invest in technologies to capture and store the gas to reduce the amount in the atmosphere. Mr Smith said this would involve tech ""that doesn't fully exist today"". The firm added that its data centres and other facilities would use 100% renewable energy by 2025. Software-maker Intuit has also pledged to be carbon negative by 2030. The Californian company has said it will reduce emissions by 50 times more than its 2018 carbon footprint. Amazon's Jeff Bezos announced in September 2019 that his company would be carbon neutral by 2040. His pledge included plans to buy 100,000 electric vehicles for the online retailer's delivery fleet. Google has launched a set of digital tools to allow cities to track and reduce emissions. The search giant also offsets its own emissions by investing in green projects.

"""The moment of crisis has come"" in efforts to tackle climate change, Sir David Attenborough has warned. He spoke asBBC News launched a year of special coverage on global warming. Here are our answers to a range of readers' questions. Climate change will need to be tackled by governments worldwide,through measures like the 2005 Kyoto Protocol.,externalThis brought nations together for the first time in a single agreement on tackling climate change. But everyone has a carbon footprint. This is the amount of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide - which contributes to global warming - released into the atmosphere by people's actions. This can be reduced in a number of ways.According to a recent report by a group of international scientists,,externaltransport is responsible for 34% of a household's carbon footprint in high-income countries like the UK. The report calls for a major programme of investment in the rail and bus network, with lower ticket prices and investment in safer cycling. A really simple guide to climate change How to reduce your carbon footprint when you fly Climate change: Should you fly, drive or take the train? Home heating presents another challenge and opportunity. It is responsible for 21% of a household's carbon footprint. This could be cut by turning down the thermostat, having better-insulated houses and changing to low-carbon heating systems. According to the United Nations,,externalthe current world population is about 7.7 billion and could reach 9.7 billion in 2050. This population growth drives higher demand for food, greater energy consumption and more competition for resources. And it increases the production of the gases that cause global warming. Anda recent major study,,externalby a global group of 11,000 scientists, concluded that the world needs to stabilise its population. The study has attracted quite a deal of controversy, but its authors say such action is needed if the world is to avoid what they call ""a catastrophic threat"" from climate change. However, not everyone agrees about the impact population growth has on climate change. Some argue, for example, that a focus on reducing individual carbon footprints would be a much effective strategy than seeking to stabilise population growth. It is estimated that 26% of global emissions come from food and more than half of this from animal products. This is because producing food from animals uses more resources than food from plants. Cows and sheep also produce methane - a greenhouse gas. According to a 2019 report by UN experts,external, switching to a plant-based diet can help fight climate change. They said that more people could be fed using less land if individuals cut down on eating meat. But they stopped short of advising people to become vegan or vegetarian. Anda University of Oxford study,externalfound that if everybody on Earth cut meat and dairy from their diet, there could be a 49% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from food production. Try our climate emissions food calculator China and the US are the world's largest emitters of CO2, responsible for 16,000 megatonnes between them a year. In terms of emissions per head of population, the picture is different. The US is still near the top, with 15.53 tonnes. But the UK (5.99 tonnes) is only slightly behind China (6.59 tonnes). So what can a smaller country, like the UK, do to exert pressure for change? On an individual level, consumers could decide to seek out ""green"" products and boycott ones from more polluting parts of the world, says Alyssa Gilbert, climate policy director at Imperial College London. There is also an opportunity for the UK to come up with innovative ideas that larger countries might adopt, Ms Gilbert suggests. ""As a country we are small and nimble, so we can pilot ideas around technology and policy in the hope that we can export them to other countries"", she says. At government level, the UK can also use diplomacy, as well as international aid, to bring about change. Carbon capture, to remove and store greenhouse gases, already happens naturally. All plants and trees take carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and groundwater. So, planting trees is seen as an important weapon in the fight against global warming. The UK's Committee on Climate Change (CCC) says significant rises in tree planting ""need to happen quickly"" if other targets to cut carbon are not met. It says 30,000 hectares of woodland should be planted annually, more than double the new trees planted in 2018. The UK government says it iscommitted to planting 11 million trees,externalby 2022. In February 2019, the Drax power station in North Yorkshire, became the first in Europe to capture carbon dioxide (CO2) from wood-burning. Another approach, currently being offered by a company in Switzerland, is topull carbon dioxide directly from the air. This gas can then be sold for other purposes, like being used to grow vegetables in hi-tech greenhouses. But schemes like these are, as yet, relatively few and small-scale.
