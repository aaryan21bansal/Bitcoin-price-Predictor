Lowry started the celebrations early, his arms aloft as he squeezed through the crowds who swarmed the 18th fairway at Northern Ireland's Royal Portrush. ""This feels like an out-of-body experience,"" said the 32-year-old. Lowry held his nerve in the wind and rain to shoot a one-over 72, with Tommy Fleetwood second on nine under. England's Fleetwood briefly threatened but a double bogey on the 14th effectively ended his challenge as he finished with a three-over 74. ""I can't wait to wake up on Monday morning and find out what it's going to feel like then. It's just going to be incredible,"" added Lowry who was mobbed before he reached the green on the last hole. 'How Lowry became Pied Piper of Portrush' The Cut podcast: Lowry Open win is 'for the island of Ireland' This video can not be played 'To do it at Portrush - you couldn't write it' says Open champion Lowry Thousands of partisan fans lined the 18th to cheer Lowry's victory procession and as he turned to embrace his caddie Brian 'Bo' Martin after hitting his second shot to the green, hundreds flooded the fairway ahead of him. Lowry and Martin were shepherded through the crowds and under a rope by marshals to allow them safe passage. There will also have been a sense of redemption for Lowry following his final-round capitulation at the US Open three years ago when, like on Sunday, he started with a four shot lead but a 76 saw him fall away as Dustin Johnson won. American Tony Finau carded a one-over-par 71 to end third on seven under, his best finish at a major. An up-and-down round for England's Lee Westwood saw him card a two-over 73 for a share of fourth that guarantees him a place at next year's Masters. He finished six under overall alongside world number one Brooks Koepka who struggled to a 74. This video can not be played Drama on the first as Fleetwood makes up a shot on Lowry There was little doubt about who the vast majority of the fans were behind from the first moment until the last, with huge cheers greeting Lowry's name when it was read out over the speakers as he arrived at the first tee. He had looked calm while out on the practice green but nerves appeared to take their hold when he tugged his opening tee shot into the rough before hitting his second into a greenside bunker. Lowry escaped with a bogey but the nerves were there for Fleetwood too as he missed a birdie putt that would have cut the lead to two. The 28-year-old, bidding to become the first Englishman to win the Open since Sir Nick Faldo in 1992, then overhit his par putt on the third and the bogey meant Lowry's advantage was four once again. That seemed to give Lowry the confidence boost he needed and he holed two successive birdie putts from the fourth. Heavy rain and wind arrived soon after and Lowry, battling both the elements and nerves, struggled after the turn, bogeying four of the five holes from the ninth. From then on it was about digging in and not giving Fleetwood the glimmer of hope of taking it down to the wire. Lowry holed a couple of crucial par putts before celebrating a birdie on the 15th with a big fist pump. It was a putt that appeared to signal the moment Fleetwood's fleeting hopes of staging a comeback were ended. Lowry's name was already being engraved on the Claret Jug as he approached the 18th green as he soaked up the adulation from the thousands gathered to witness the biggest win of his career. Shane Lowry coped with the difficult conditions better than his umbrella did Westwood, runner up at 2010 The Open, will have arrived at Portrush on Sunday quietly confident of mounting a challenge as he looked to break his major duck. The 46-year-old Englishman made a poor start with a bogey on the first but recovered with three birdies over his next four holes. However, every time he looked like threatening the leading pair, the chance to close the gap passed him by. He left a birdie putt hanging on the edge of the seventh hole before missing another opportunity on the eighth. His challenge effectively ended around the turn with bogeys on the ninth, 11th and 12th and he finished six under overall after carding a two-over 73. Westwood's fourth-place finish does mean he has earned a first Masters appearance since 2017 next April Westwood's compatriot Justin Rose had an even tougher day. He shanked a shot almost sideways in the midst of the heavy rain while on the ninth and did not pick up a birdie until the 12th hole. But three bogeys in his last six holes saw him return to the clubhouse with an eight-over 79 to end one under. In contrast, Scotland's Bob MacIntyre and England's Tyrrell Hatton were the only two golfers who finished in the top six to fire under-par rounds on Sunday. Much of that will be down to their earlier start time and missing the stormy weather. MacIntyre, making his major debut, hit a three-under-par 68 while Hatton finished on two under. They shared sixth place alongside England's Danny Willett (73) and American Rickie Fowler (74).

Asked if he had enjoyed his week as defending champion, Molinari, who had opened with a three-over 74 in round one, said: ""I can't lie - some bits of it yes, some bits of it no. ""But I was not managing my expectations well enough unfortunately. On Sunday I was playing more freely, just enjoying the support from the crowd."" The parties in Portrush will go long into the night, but one person who will not be in the mood for any celebrations any time soon is JB Holmes.

However, he endured a horror round of 87 that included six bogeys, four double bogeys and one triple bogey, finishing 16 over for the day and six over for the tournament.

"This video can not be played A large group of masked men in white T-shirts stormed Yuen Long station Hong Kong has been left in shock after a night of violence on Sunday, which saw dozens of masked men storm a train station. The men - dressed in white shirts and suspected to be triad gangsters - assaulted pro-democracy protesters and passers-by in the Yuen Long area. This is the first time this kind of violence has been seen in the ongoing anti-extradition demonstrations. Several lawmakers questioned why police were slow to arrive at the scene. Footage posted on social media showed dozens of men attacking people with wooden rods and metal sticks inside the station. Forty-five people were injured, with one person in critical condition.

Hong Kong's Chief Executive Carrie Lam told reporters the gang attacks were ""shocking"". She also condemned protesters for defacing China's main representative office in the city earlier on Sunday. Pro-democracy protesters were set upon as they travelled back from a rally in the centre of Hong Kong, where riot police had fired tear gas and rubber bullets at protesters. The masked men stormed Yuen Long MTR station at about 22:30 local time (14:30 GMT). Local media said they were targeting people dressed in black - the colour most protesters were wearing. Were triads involved in Hong Kong violence? What are the protests about? Profile: Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam In a statement, the government said: ""This is absolutely unacceptable to Hong Kong as a society that observes the rule of law. The SAR [Special Administrative Region] Government strongly condemns any violence and will seriously take enforcement actions."" One journalist, Gwyneth Ho, was attacked while she was in the middle of live streaming for news website Stand News. She is currently in hospital. Allow Twitter content?

The Hong Kong Journalist Association said some reporters on the scene had equipment seized. One witness - Galileo Cheng, 34 - told the BBC he had suffered several blows to his back and arms when he stepped in to try to help Ms Ho. He said he saw another woman with a baby being assaulted too. It is not known who organised the attack. Opposition lawmaker Lam Cheuk-ting suggested the mob had ties to organised crime syndicates. ""Is Hong Kong now allowing triads to do what they want, beating up people on the street with weapons?"" he asked reporters. Another pro-democracy lawmaker, Ray Chan, tweeted a complaint about the police response. ""Hong Kong has one of the world's highest cop to population ratio ... Where were [they?]"" Video footage also surfaced of pro-Beijing lawmaker Junius Ho, shaking hands with men in white and giving them the thumbs-up signal. On Facebook, he denied a connection with the men and said he was just responding to their greetings when they recognised him on the street after he left a restaurant. His office was later ransacked. Police on Monday said they had not made any arrests but were still carrying out investigations. Some of the assailants did not seem too concerned about masking their identity, posting selfies online, before during and after the attack, reported the BBC's China correspondent Stephen McDonell. By Martin Yip, BBC News Chinese, Hong Kong Yuen Long is a centuries-old farming and trading town, which has hugely expanded in recent decades. Most of its village leaders and their clans are pro-China. On Sunday evening, people began to share photos online that showed coach loads of men in white shirts congregating in the area. Later - after the train station attacks - many of these men were seen running back to the surrounding villages, intensifying speculation that they were backed by the locals, if not hired by them. Pro-democracy demonstrators have now announced that they want to move a pre-planned rally to Yuen Long next Sunday as a reaction to the outburst of violence. Until now all rallies have been held more centrally. One villager told me that local clans are concerned by the shift, as it feels like people are ""messing around on their doorstep"". He said they consider the protesters to be thugs who need to be taught a lesson. Mass protests have been held for weeks, initially over an extradition deal with mainland China, which the Hong Kong government has since suspended. The unrest has now spread to cover broader demands for democratic reform and reflect concerns that freedoms are being eroded. This video can not be played Tear gas was fired at the Hong Kong pro-democracy protest on Sunday In a rare act, protesters defaced the liaison office, China's central government building, on Sunday. One of the graffiti slogans read: ""You taught us peaceful marches are useless."" Ms Lam strongly condemned the vandalism by ""radical demonstrators"", saying they had acted ""maliciously"" and ""challenged the nation's sovereignty"". A national emblem was splashed with paint outside the Chinese Liaison Office on Sunday Some protesters also covered CCTV cameras outside a police station with spray paint. Organisers of the protest say more than 430,000 people took part in the rally, but police put the figure at 138,000. On Saturday a counter-rally, in support of the police and against protest violence, drew 300,000 people according to organisers and 103,000 people according to police. This video can not be played ""You are fake news"" - BBC correspondent heckled live on air during Saturday's rally They were sparked by the proposed extradition bill that would have allowed people to be sent to China for trial. Critics said it would undermine Hong Kong's judicial independence and could be used to target those who spoke out against the Chinese government.

"This video can not be played A Royal Navy frigate can be heard warning Iranian armed forces, before the oil tanker is seized The UK government did not take its ""eye off the ball"" over the seizure of a UK-flagged oil tanker in the Gulf on Friday, the chancellor told the BBC. Philip Hammond said the UK has been working closely with US and European partners in response to Iran's actions. But ex-Tory party leader Iain Duncan Smith said the Stena Impero's capture was a ""major failure"" for the UK. Theresa May is to chair a meeting of the emergency response committee Cobra on Monday to discuss the issue. Iran's foreign minister has said that only""prudence and foresight"",externalwould reduce tensions between Iran and Britain. The 23 crew members, who are Indian, Russian, Latvian and Filipino, have now been taken off the ship for ""questioning"", Iran's Press TV has reported. Charts showing the ship was in Omani waters when it was captured prove its seizure was in ""clear violation of international law"", the UK Chamber of Shipping said. The UK has accused Iran of ""unacceptable and highly escalatory"" action, in aletter to the president of the United Nations Security Council,external. Speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr programme, Mr Hammond said the UK would pursue ""every possible diplomatic route"" to resolve the situation. He said sanctions, including financial, against Iran are already in place, and it was unclear what more could be done. Mr Hammond,who announced his intention to resign if Boris Johnson becomes prime minister, added: ""We are of course looking at all the options."" But Mr Duncan Smith told the BBC there are questions to be raised about the British government's behaviour. He said the detention of a tanker carrying Iranian oil two weeks earlier ought to have served as a warning British vessels in the Gulf needed protection. The MP said he understood the US had offered the UK ""assets"" to support its shipping and they were not taken up. ""This is a major failure and the government has to answer that charge very quickly indeed."" Defence minister Tobias Ellwood told Sky the Royal Navy was too small to manage the UK's interests around the globe but had not been negligent in protecting its ships. Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt earlier said Iran viewed this as a ""tit-for-tat situation"" but ""nothing could be further from the truth"". Labour shadow justice minister Richard Burgon said the UK should avoid becoming Donald Trump's ""sidekicks"" and warned a US-backed conflict with Iran could be worse than the Iraq War. On Friday, the Stena Impero was seized by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard in the Strait of Hormuz after Tehran said it was ""violating international maritime rules"". A second tanker, the British-owned MV Mesdar, was also boarded by armed guards but released. Video released by Iran's Revolutionary Guard-affiliated Fars news agency appeared to show the moment the tanker was raided. This video can not be played Footage released by Iran's Revolutionary Guard-affiliated Fars news agency appears to show Stena Impero being seized HMS Montrose was alerted but it was too far away to stop the seizure. A recording of radio exchangesbetween a Royal Navy frigate and Iranian armed forces vessels moments before the tanker was seized was also released. In the recording, an Iranian vessel tells HMS Montrose it wants to inspect the Stena Impero for security reasons. Iran's state-run IRNA news agency said the tanker was captured after it collided with a fishing boat and failed to respond to calls from the smaller craft. But Mr Hunt said it was seized in Omani waters in ""clear contravention of international law"" and forced to sail into Bandar Abbas port in Iran. The tanker's owner, Stena Bulk, said it has made a formal request to visit the crew members. A relative of an Indian crew member aboard the Stena Impero told the BBC on Sunday the family was concerned and had not received any messages from him since the vessel was detained. The seizure of the Stena Impero comes two weeks after Royal Marineshelped seize Iranian tanker Grace 1off Gibraltar, because of evidence it was carrying oil to Syria in breach of EU sanctions. Mr Hunt said the Grace 1 was detained legally, but Iran said this was ""piracy"" andthreatened to seize a British oil tankerin retaliation This video can not be played Jeremy Hunt says Iran views the tanker seizure as a ""tit-for-tat situation"" Iran's foreign minister Javad Zarif tweeted,externalthat the UK ""must cease being an accessory to #EconomicTerrorism of the US"". He said Iran guarantees the security of the Gulf and the Strait of Hormuz, and insisted its action were to ""uphold international maritime rules"". Iran's ambassador to London has warned the UK against escalating tensions. Hamid Baeidinejad said in atweet,external: ""This is quite dangerous and unwise at a sensitive time in the region. Iran however is firm and ready for different scenarios."" This video can not be played Why does the Strait of Hormuz matter? Relations have been deteriorating between Iran and the UK and US. In April, the US tightened sanctions it had re-imposed on Iran after withdrawing from a 2015 nuclear deal. The US blamed Iran for attacks on tankers since May, which Tehran denies. On Friday,the US claimed to have destroyed an Iranian drone in the Gulf. The UK government has remained committed to the deal, which curbs Iran's nuclear activities in return for the lifting of sanctions. However, the UK'shelp in seizing the Iranian tankerGrace 1 infuriated Iran. Last week, the UK said Iranian boats also attempted to impede a British oil tanker in the region before being warned off by HMS Montrose but Iran denied this. The White House said Friday's incident was the second time in more than a week the UK had been ""the target of escalatory violence"" by Iran. US Central Command said it was developing a multinational maritime effort in response to the situation. The Pentagon saidUS troops are being deployed to Saudi Arabiato defend American interests in the region from ""emergent credible threats"". France and Germany called on Iran to release the Stena Impero. A diplomatic solution to this crisis is going to be complicated, not least because Britain's relationships with its traditional partners - the US and the Europeans - are under strain. Diplomatic pressure - action at the UN or tough economic sanctions - requires the building of a coalition. Think back to the collective action taken against Moscow in the wake of the murder of a British woman by Russian agents in Salisbury. The US and Britain's Nato and European allies all expelled Russian diplomats in an impressive show of solidarity. But will the same solidarity be shown towards Tehran? France and Germany have given London rhetorical support. President Trump is standing beside his British ally. But the US and the EU are fundamentally at loggerheads over the fate of the nuclear deal with Iran and what many European capitals see as a thinly disguised US policy that seeks regime change in Tehran. Read more analysis here.,external Ships must fly the flag of a nation state but it does not need to be the same nation as its owners. The Stena Impero is Swedish-owned and those on board are Indian, Russian, Latvian and Filipino. A relative of a crew member from India, who did not want to be identified, told the BBC the family was being kept well informed by the Swedish company. They felt reassured about diplomatic efforts to free the ship after a meeting with company officials attended by crew members' families on Sunday afternoon, he said. But it is the UK flag that is important symbolically and politically, explained Richard Meade from maritime publication Lloyds List.

"This video can not be played Simon Coveney: Ireland would have to protect its place in the EU single market If the new UK prime minister wants to ""tear up"" the existing withdrawal agreement with the EU ""we're in trouble"", Ireland's deputy PM has said. Simon Coveney said the decision for a no-deal Brexit would be the UK's but added checks ""of some sorts"" would be needed in the Irish Republic. Ireland would have to protect its place in the single market, he told the BBC. Both men vying to become UK PM say they want to change the withdrawal deal and, in particular, the so-called backstop. Mr Coveney warned: ""That's a little bit like saying, 'Give me what I want or I'm going to burn the house down for everybody.'"" He told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show he hoped the UK and EU would negotiate a future relationship that would mean the backstop - designed as an insurance policy to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland - could be avoided. However, he warned it could not be removed from the withdrawal agreement. Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop 10 things that stopped Brexit happening PM candidates' backstop remarks 'significant' ""The EU has made it very clear that we want to engage with the new British prime minister, we want to avoid a no-deal Brexit but the solutions that have been put in place to do that haven't changed,"" Mr Coveney said. ""If the British government forces a no-deal Brexit on everybody else, the Republic of Ireland will have no choice but to protect its own place in the EU single market. That would fundamentally disrupt the all-Ireland economy."" He said the all-Ireland economy had helped maintain peace on the island of Ireland but that protecting it would ""not be possible"" in the event of a no-deal Brexit. However, he added that contingency plans were being drawn up with the European Commission to try to minimise the disruption. Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt have said they would keep no deal on the table to strengthen negotiations But former Tory leader and Brexiteer Iain Duncan Smith said both the EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier and the Irish prime minister had told him there would be no hard border with Northern Ireland in the event of a no-deal Brexit. ""I asked, well, lay out what your proposals are - and we'd already proposed alternative arrangements - and basically what was described to me was alternative arrangements - the same thing we'd been talking to them about which would alleviate the idea of necessary checks on the island of Ireland based on what exists at the moment,"" Mr Duncan Smith said. AndDUP leader Arlene Foster said she was ""disappointed, but not surprised"" by what Mr Coveneyhad said, and accused him of trying to ""look tough"" in the eyes of the incoming prime minister. The DUP, whose 10 MPs are crucial for the Conservative Party's majority, has said it does not want the UK to leave the EU without a deal, but believes ruling out no-deal would damage the UK's negotiating hand. By Jayne McCormack, BBC Northern Ireland's political reporter Much of what Simon Coveney had to say today mirrored his warnings in the past. No time limit on the backstop, there is wiggle room on the political declaration and no deal would be a disaster for the economy. But there was one key difference this time - his intended recipient of the message. The Irish government is acutely aware that the incoming prime minister is likely to want to make good on his Brexit strategy. No deal is still on the table. The Republic of Ireland has managed to keep the EU on board and its backstop argument has not changed - but can it hold the line? This was also the clearest interview from Mr Coveney yet - stressing if a no-deal Brexit does happen, the blame rests with Westminster, not Dublin. DUP leader Arlene Foster hit back that the Irish deputy prime minister was trying to ""look tough"" to the new PM. In the coming days, we will likely see much more ""tough talk"" emerging from both sides. The withdrawal agreement has been rejected three times by MPs in the Commons, with the backstop a key sticking point among Brexiteers. The two men vying to become the next prime minister, Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt, have said the backstop is ""dead"" - a position seen as increasing the likelihood of a no-deal Brexit. If MPs fail to support a Brexit deal agreed between UK and EU by 31 October, the legal default is to leave with no deal on that date. Both contenders to be the next prime minister have said they want to leave on that date and renegotiate with the EU, leaving with a deal. But Mr Hunt and Mr Johnson have also said they would keep the possibility of no deal on the table to strengthen negotiations, despite Parliament voting to rule the option out. Mr Johnson has also refused to rule out suspending Parliament to force a no-deal Brexit through. This week, MPs backed abid to make it harder for a new prime minister to do this. A majority of 41 approved the amendment, with four cabinet ministers, including Chancellor Philip Hammond, abstaining.

Lowry started the celebrations early, his arms aloft as he squeezed through the crowds who swarmed the 18th fairway at Northern Ireland's Royal Portrush. ""This feels like an out-of-body experience,"" said the 32-year-old. Lowry held his nerve in the wind and rain to shoot a one-over 72, with Tommy Fleetwood second on nine under. England's Fleetwood briefly threatened but a double bogey on the 14th effectively ended his challenge as he finished with a three-over 74. ""I can't wait to wake up on Monday morning and find out what it's going to feel like then. It's just going to be incredible,"" added Lowry who was mobbed before he reached the green on the last hole. 'How Lowry became Pied Piper of Portrush' The Cut podcast: Lowry Open win is 'for the island of Ireland' This video can not be played 'To do it at Portrush - you couldn't write it' says Open champion Lowry Thousands of partisan fans lined the 18th to cheer Lowry's victory procession and as he turned to embrace his caddie Brian 'Bo' Martin after hitting his second shot to the green, hundreds flooded the fairway ahead of him. Lowry and Martin were shepherded through the crowds and under a rope by marshals to allow them safe passage. There will also have been a sense of redemption for Lowry following his final-round capitulation at the US Open three years ago when, like on Sunday, he started with a four shot lead but a 76 saw him fall away as Dustin Johnson won. American Tony Finau carded a one-over-par 71 to end third on seven under, his best finish at a major. An up-and-down round for England's Lee Westwood saw him card a two-over 73 for a share of fourth that guarantees him a place at next year's Masters. He finished six under overall alongside world number one Brooks Koepka who struggled to a 74. This video can not be played Drama on the first as Fleetwood makes up a shot on Lowry There was little doubt about who the vast majority of the fans were behind from the first moment until the last, with huge cheers greeting Lowry's name when it was read out over the speakers as he arrived at the first tee. He had looked calm while out on the practice green but nerves appeared to take their hold when he tugged his opening tee shot into the rough before hitting his second into a greenside bunker. Lowry escaped with a bogey but the nerves were there for Fleetwood too as he missed a birdie putt that would have cut the lead to two. The 28-year-old, bidding to become the first Englishman to win the Open since Sir Nick Faldo in 1992, then overhit his par putt on the third and the bogey meant Lowry's advantage was four once again. That seemed to give Lowry the confidence boost he needed and he holed two successive birdie putts from the fourth. Heavy rain and wind arrived soon after and Lowry, battling both the elements and nerves, struggled after the turn, bogeying four of the five holes from the ninth. From then on it was about digging in and not giving Fleetwood the glimmer of hope of taking it down to the wire. Lowry holed a couple of crucial par putts before celebrating a birdie on the 15th with a big fist pump. It was a putt that appeared to signal the moment Fleetwood's fleeting hopes of staging a comeback were ended. Lowry's name was already being engraved on the Claret Jug as he approached the 18th green as he soaked up the adulation from the thousands gathered to witness the biggest win of his career. Shane Lowry coped with the difficult conditions better than his umbrella did Westwood, runner up at 2010 The Open, will have arrived at Portrush on Sunday quietly confident of mounting a challenge as he looked to break his major duck. The 46-year-old Englishman made a poor start with a bogey on the first but recovered with three birdies over his next four holes. However, every time he looked like threatening the leading pair, the chance to close the gap passed him by. He left a birdie putt hanging on the edge of the seventh hole before missing another opportunity on the eighth. His challenge effectively ended around the turn with bogeys on the ninth, 11th and 12th and he finished six under overall after carding a two-over 73. Westwood's fourth-place finish does mean he has earned a first Masters appearance since 2017 next April Westwood's compatriot Justin Rose had an even tougher day. He shanked a shot almost sideways in the midst of the heavy rain while on the ninth and did not pick up a birdie until the 12th hole. But three bogeys in his last six holes saw him return to the clubhouse with an eight-over 79 to end one under. In contrast, Scotland's Bob MacIntyre and England's Tyrrell Hatton were the only two golfers who finished in the top six to fire under-par rounds on Sunday. Much of that will be down to their earlier start time and missing the stormy weather. MacIntyre, making his major debut, hit a three-under-par 68 while Hatton finished on two under. They shared sixth place alongside England's Danny Willett (73) and American Rickie Fowler (74). This video can not be played The Open 2019: Fleetwood, Fowler & Reed in best shots from day four Francesco Molinari, the 2018 winner, never really got his defence going, although he did finish on a high by shooting the best round of the day. The Italian, who won by two shots at Carnoustie last year, shot a five-under 66, which included an eagle on the 12th. Asked if he had enjoyed his week as defending champion, Molinari, who had opened with a three-over 74 in round one, said: ""I can't lie - some bits of it yes, some bits of it no. ""But I was not managing my expectations well enough unfortunately. On Sunday I was playing more freely, just enjoying the support from the crowd."" The parties in Portrush will go long into the night, but one person who will not be in the mood for any celebrations any time soon is JB Holmes. The American led at the halfway stage of the tournament and was third on 10 under at the start of the final day, primed to challenge for the victory. However, he endured a horror round of 87 that included six bogeys, four double bogeys and one triple bogey, finishing 16 over for the day and six over for the tournament.

"The proposal would allow renters in England to check up on their prospective landlord A database of rogue landlords would be opened up to prospective tenants under government plans. The Rogue Landlords Database was launched in 2018 and only has ten names on it so far. It includes those who have been banned for failing to make a property habitable, or have been convicted of serious offences. At the moment the list is only open to local authorities but under a package of rent reforms it will be opened up. The proposals apply to England as housing policy has been devolved. ""This database has the potential to ensure that poor quality homes across the country are improved and the worst landlords are banned, and it is right that we unlock this crucial information for new and prospective tenants,"" said Communities Secretary James Brokenshire. ""Landlords should be in no doubt that they must provide decent homes or face the consequences."" No-fault evictions 'will hurt tenants' Ministers pledge to end 'poor doors' Young face renting 'all their lives' Where's the best place to rent a home? More than four and half million households rent from private landlords in England, a number which has risen dramatically in recent years as buying a house has become more expensive. ""Renters have to provide references from employers and previous landlords before a landlord hands over the keys to a new flat. So it is only fair that renters get the opportunity to check that a prospective landlord doesn't have a criminal record,"" said Dan Wilson Craw, director of Generation Rent, which campaigns on behalf of tenants. ""This plan is another victory for renters, though we need much more effective enforcement to identify all landlords who have been breaking the law,"" he added. The move will be open to a 12-week consultation which will also consider whether to widen the scope of the rogue list to more housing-related offences, such as breaching the Tenant Fees Act. Access to the Rogue Landlords Database is part of a wider package of reform to the rental sector, which includes an end to no-fault evictions, which allow landlords to get rid of tenants without a reason after their fixed-term tenancy period has ended.

"Arlene Foster was speaking on BBC's Sunday Politics from Portrush, where The Open golf tournament is being staged ""Serious negotiations"" are taking place to try to restore devolution at Stormont, the DUP leader Arlene Foster has said. Northern Ireland has been without a government since 2017, when the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in split in a bitter row. A new talks process began on 7 May to try to end two and a half years of deadlock. Mrs Foster said her party will be involved in discussions at Stormont this coming week. Ireland hopes backstop will be 'unnecessary' Stormont stalemate - how things stand Northern Ireland bill - what happens next? Speaking on the BBC's Sunday Politics programme, Mrs Foster said the DUP had also spent all of last week in party political negotiations. However, it is understood a round-table talks session was cancelled on Thursday. Mrs Foster denied suggestions that the negotiations were no longer a five-party process, but added that the smaller parties recognise that the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in have the most significant ""gaps to resolve"". She said she wanted a future executive to be made up of the five main parties. The DUP leader also commented ona move by MPslast week that will see same-sex marriage extended to Northern Ireland and abortion laws liberalised if devolution is not restored by 21 October. Her party is socially conservative and opposes a change in the law on both issues. Mrs Foster was among politicians who signed a letter to the prime minister calling for the decision on abortion to be reversed. She described it as the most ""insidious"" clause in the Northern Ireland Bill, arguing that the matter should remain devolved and that she did not believe a majority of people in Northern Ireland would support the change. ""I don't believe there is any support at all to go to a situation where you would have abortion up to 28 weeks,"" she added. Mrs Foster said she had spoken to Sinn FÃ©in vice-president Michelle O'Neill about the issue. MPs have backed amendments which require the government to extend same-sex marriage to Northern Ireland if devolution is not restored The DUP is due to renew the confidence-and-supply pact it shares with the Conservative Party, when the new prime minister takes office this week. The arrangementwas signed in June 2017 after the general election, to give the government a working majority in the Commons. Mrs Foster reiterated that her party will continue to do business with the government. The DUP is opposed to the current withdrawal agreement, and wants the new prime minister to negotiate a different Brexit deal. It believes the backstop - the insurance policy to avoid a hard border between NI and the Republic of Ireland - would create a trade border down the Irish Sea and threaten the integrity of the union. On Sunday, the TÃ¡naiste (deputy prime minister)Simon Coveney dismissed suggestionsthat could work and said if a no-deal outcome occurs on 31 October, it will have been a ""British choice"" that damages stability in Northern Ireland. Mrs Foster said she was ""disappointed, but not surprised"" by what Mr Coveney had said, and accused him of trying to ""look tough"" in the eyes of the incoming prime minister. The DUP has said it does not want the UK to leave the EU without a deal, but believes ruling out no-deal would damage the UK's negotiating hand. ""It's a long way to the 31st of October.. the withdrawal agreement is bad for Northern Ireland and the union and we're looking to change that,"" said Mrs Foster.

"This video can not be played A Royal Navy frigate can be heard warning Iranian armed forces, before the oil tanker is seized A recording has emerged of radio exchanges between a Royal Navy frigate and Iranian armed forces vessels, moments before a UK-flagged oil tanker was seized in the Gulf on Friday. In the recording, an Iranian vessel tells HMS Montrose it wants to inspect the Stena Impero for security reasons. Chancellor Philip Hammond said the government would pursue ""every possible diplomatic route"" in response. But Iran's ambassador to London warned the UK against escalating tensions. Hamid Baeidinejad saidin a tweet,external: ""This is quite dangerous and unwise at a sensitive time in the region. Iran however is firm and ready for different scenarios."" The UK's foreign secretary has urged Iran to reverse the tanker's ""illegal"" seizure. Jeremy Hunt said MPs would be updated on Monday about what ""further measures"" the government would take. On Friday, the Stena Impero was seized by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard in the Strait of Hormuz, a key shipping route in the Gulf. A second British-linked tanker, the MV Mesdar, was also boarded by armed guards but was released. Tehran said the Stena Impero was ""violating international maritime rules"". Video released by Iran's Revolutionary Guard-affiliated Fars news agency on Saturday appeared to show the moment the tanker was raided. It shows masked forces dropping down ropes on to the ship from a helicopter after it was surrounded by high-speed vessels. This video can not be played Footage released by Iran's Revolutionary Guard-affiliated Fars news agency appears to show Stena Impero being seized HMS Montrose was alerted but it was too far away to stop the seizure. Iran's state-run IRNA news agency said the tanker was captured after it collided with a fishing boat and failed to respond to calls from the smaller craft. But Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said it was seized in Omani waters in ""clear contravention of international law"" and then forced to sail into Iran. The tanker's owners, Stena Bulk, said it had been complying with regulations and had been in international waters. It said it had requested access to the port of Bandar Abbas to visit crew members, who are Indian, Russian, Latvian and Filipino, and said to be in good health. The seizure of the Stena Impero comes two weeks after Royal Marineshelped seize Iranian tanker Grace 1off Gibraltar, because of evidence it was carrying oil to Syria in breach of EU sanctions. Mr Hunt said the Grace 1 was detained legally, but Iran said this was ""piracy"" andthreatened to seize a British oil tankerin retaliation. In the radio recording the Iranian vessel can be heard telling a ship - thought to be the Stena Impero - to change its course, saying: ""If you obey you will be safe."" HMS Montrose identifies itself in the recording, obtained by British maritime security firm Dryad Global. It tells the Stena Impero: ""As you are conducting transit passage in a recognised international strait, under international law your passage must not be impaired, impeded, obstructed or hampered."" The frigate then asks the Iranian vessel to confirm it is not ""intending to violate international law"" by attempting to board the tanker. Speaking after a call with his Iranian counterpart on Saturday, Mr Hunt said Iran viewed this as a ""tit-for-tat situation"" but he added that ""nothing could be further from the truth"". Ministers have held emergency Cobra meetings and a senior Iranian diplomat was summoned to the Foreign Office. This video can not be played Jeremy Hunt says Iran views the tanker seizure as a ""tit-for-tat situation"" ""Our priority continues to be to find a way to de-escalate the situation,"" Mr Hunt said. The government is advising UK shipping to stay out of the area. Defence minister Tobias Ellwood told Sky News sanctions against Iran were among the options being considered in response. Speaking to Sky News on Sunday, Mr Ellwood denied that the UK had taken its ""eye off the ball"" and said ""it is impossible simply to escort each individual vessel"". Labour shadow justice minister Richard Burgon told the same programme the UK should avoid becoming Donald Trump's ""sidekicks"" and warned that a US-backed conflict with Iran could be worse than the Iraq War. Former Cabinet minister Iain Duncan Smith described the seizure of the Stena Impero as a ""major failure"" by the UK. Speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, he called on the government to explain why it did not increase protection for ships in the region after he said the US had offered its support. Iran's foreign minister Javad Zarif tweeted,externalthat the UK ""must cease being an accessory to #EconomicTerrorism of the US"". He said Iran guarantees the security of the Gulf and the Strait of Hormuz, and insisted its action were to ""uphold international maritime rules"". This video can not be played Why does the Strait of Hormuz matter? The latest developments come against a backdrop of deteriorating relations between Iran and the UK and US. Tensions between the US and Iran have risen since April, when the US tightened sanctions it had reimposed on Iran after unilaterally withdrawing from a 2015 nuclear deal. The US blamed Iran for attacks on tankers since May, which Tehran denies. On Friday,the US claimed to have destroyed an Iranian drone in the Gulf. The UK government has remained committed to the deal, which curbs Iran's nuclear activities in return for the lifting of sanctions tensions. However, the UK's decision tohelp seize the Iranian tankerGrace 1 earlier this month infuriated Iran. Last week, Iranian boats attempted to impede a British oil tanker in the region before being warned off by HMS Montrose.  Iran denied it was attempting to seize the ship. A White House National Security Council spokesman said Friday's incident was the second time in over a week the UK had been ""the target of escalatory violence"" by Iran. And US Central Command said it was developing a multinational maritime effort in response to the situation. The Pentagon has saidUS troops are being deployed to Saudi Arabiato defend American interests in the region from ""emergent credible threats"". France and Germany called on the Iranian authorities to quickly release the Stena Impero. The European Union's foreign affairs office, which represents 28 member states, expressed ""deep concern"". A diplomatic solution to this crisis is going to be complicated, not least because Britain's relationships with its traditional partners - the US and the Europeans - are under strain. Diplomatic pressure - action at the UN or tough economic sanctions - requires the building of a coalition. Think back to the collective action taken against Moscow in the wake of the murder of a British woman by Russian agents in Salisbury. The US and Britain's Nato and European allies all expelled Russian diplomats in an impressive show of solidarity. But will the same solidarity be shown towards Tehran? France and Germany have given London rhetorical support. President Trump is standing beside his British ally. But the US and the EU are fundamentally at loggerheads over the fate of the nuclear deal with Iran and what many European capitals see as a thinly disguised US policy that seeks regime change in Tehran. Read more analysis here. The seizing of a British-flagged tanker in Omani waters, empty and inbound to a Saudi port, marks a serious escalation in a whole catalogue of recent incidents in the Gulf. It comes on the back of the mysterious mining of tankers, the downing of both US and Iranian drones and the near capture of another British-flagged tanker only a few days ago. Britain wants its response be two things: Measured and multinational. The government is trying to send a robust message to Iran that this action is unacceptable, not just to the UK but to the rest of the world, but not so robust that it ends up being part of an avoidable US military strike. This has become a highly volatile situation where not everyone believes in diplomacy. There are figures in Washington who have been pushing for an ever-tougher line with Iran. And there are figures in Iran, notably in the Revolutionary Guards Corps and the security apparatus, who are quite prepared to push this right up to the brink of a conflict, yet probably stopping just short of one. Ships must fly the flag of a nation state, explains Richard Meade, managing editor of maritime intelligence publication Lloyd's List. But that doesn't need to be the same nation as its owners, its crew, or its cargo, he says. The Stena Impero is Swedish-owned and those on board are Indian, Russian, Latvian and Filipino. But it's the UK flag that is important symbolically, he says. ""Historically speaking it means that the UK owes protection to the vessel."" ""The UK has political responsibilities to anything that is flagged. And that's why it's much more serious than if there just happened to be a British captain on board."" He says the impact on trade in the region had so far been minimal, but warns that if the international community began viewing the Strait of Hormuz as a dangerous place, it could create a ""very different"" scenario.

"In 2017, most drug-related deaths involved heroin but a large percentage had also taken pills The Home Office has been urged to take part in an emergency summit about Scotland's record drugs deaths. The number of drug-related deaths in Scotland soared to 1,187 last year, the highest rate since records began in 1996.

Scotland has highest drug death rate in EU What can be done about Scotland's drugs crisis? Scotland's drug death crisis in six charts In his letter to the Home Secretary Sajid Javid, Mr FitzPatrick described the ""tragic"" increase in drugs deaths as ""unacceptable"" and added: ""I take seriously the impact this has on individuals, families and communities."" Mr FitzPatrick wrote: ""In response to these shocking statistics, I am inviting the UK government to work with the Scottish government to tackle this problem which claims so many lives."" Asking for a government minister to attend a proposed emergency summit - expected to be held in Glasgow - about the problem, he added: ""The Scottish government has already agreed that we will host such a summit, where government representatives, local authorities and the chair of Scotland's new drug deaths taskforce would be invited, ensuring the voices of those with experience of using drugs, and their families, are also heard. ""I understand that there is cross-party support for this conversation, including from [Scottish Conservative] Miles Briggs MSP, who has written to me to offer his support."" Public Health Minister Joe FitzPatrick said the deaths were an ""emergency"" Mr Briggs, the Scottish Conservative health spokesman, described the situation as a ""national emergency"" and called for ""serious and detailed conversation"". He said: ""This is a crisis that spans political divides, so we would hope that both Scottish and UK governments are involved."" The Home Office said it would be responding to Mr FitzPatrick's letter in due course and a spokesman added: ""Any death related to drug misuse is a tragedy. ""The causes of drug misuse are complex and need a range of policy responses and many of the powers to deal with drug dependency such as healthcare, housing and criminal justice are devolved in Scotland.

"The proposal would allow renters in England to check up on their prospective landlord A database of rogue landlords would be opened up to prospective tenants under government plans. The Rogue Landlords Database was launched in 2018 and only has ten names on it so far. It includes those who have been banned for failing to make a property habitable, or have been convicted of serious offences. At the moment the list is only open to local authorities but under a package of rent reforms it will be opened up. The proposals apply to England as housing policy has been devolved. ""This database has the potential to ensure that poor quality homes across the country are improved and the worst landlords are banned, and it is right that we unlock this crucial information for new and prospective tenants,"" said Communities Secretary James Brokenshire. ""Landlords should be in no doubt that they must provide decent homes or face the consequences."" No-fault evictions 'will hurt tenants' Ministers pledge to end 'poor doors' Young face renting 'all their lives' Where's the best place to rent a home? More than four and half million households rent from private landlords in England, a number which has risen dramatically in recent years as buying a house has become more expensive. ""Renters have to provide references from employers and previous landlords before a landlord hands over the keys to a new flat. So it is only fair that renters get the opportunity to check that a prospective landlord doesn't have a criminal record,"" said Dan Wilson Craw, director of Generation Rent, which campaigns on behalf of tenants. ""This plan is another victory for renters, though we need much more effective enforcement to identify all landlords who have been breaking the law,"" he added. The move will be open to a 12-week consultation which will also consider whether to widen the scope of the rogue list to more housing-related offences, such as breaching the Tenant Fees Act. Access to the Rogue Landlords Database is part of a wider package of reform to the rental sector, which includes an end to no-fault evictions, which allow landlords to get rid of tenants without a reason after their fixed-term tenancy period has ended.

"Bianca Devins, surrounded by hearts, in an image she posted on Instagram in May Like many other teenagers her age, Bianca Devins lived her life online. The 17 year old had recently graduated from high school and was looking forward to starting a psychology course at a community college later this year. As last Saturday approached, she wrote on a gaming platform about how excited she was to be travelling the 250 miles from upstate New York to a concert in Queens. But before she could return home on Sunday morning, Bianca was dead. The exact relationship she'd had with the man accused of killing her remains unclear. But in the hours after his arrest, it emerged he had shared graphic photographs of the murder online. In the days since, her story has spread across the world - as have the violent images of her death. Her murder, which played out so publicly, is the latest case to place scrutiny on how social media companies police extreme content. Here, we detail how Bianca's murder was shared and exploited online in the hours and days after her death. ""Here comes Hell. It's redemption, right?"" Brandon Andrew Clark posed that question, taken from a rock song, to his Instagram followers in a temporary 24-hour story posted before dawn last Sunday. The next image he shared was far more disturbing. A blurry photograph captioned ""I'm sorry Bianca"" appeared to show a woman's bloodied torso. Before then his Instagram account, which we have chosen not to name, was mostly used to catalogue selfies and posts about music and art. Police believe the 21 year old had met Bianca through the platform two months earlier and their relationship had progressed in person since. A quote from the 1999 film Fight Club (left) was also shared to the account On Saturday, he drove Bianca to New York City from Utica, where she lived, to see Canadian singer Nicole Dollanganger perform. Police said they believed the pair had got into an argument on the way back, possibly about her kissing someone else, and he had fatally attacked her with a knife. Police said the suspect shared an even more graphic photograph of Bianca's body on Discord - a popular messaging platform for gamers. This image showed the extent of injuries to Bianca's throat and made clear her wounds had been fatal. Screenshots from the now-deleted private chat on Discord, apparently used by friends of Bianca, show he shared the image at about 06:00. As concerned friends scrambled to work out if the photo was real, the suspect continued to post offensive content in the group. Members then took screengrabs of the messages and of his Snapchat account, and raised the alarm. By 07:20, Utica Police had received ""numerous"" calls, including some from other US states, about the disturbing posts. Police said the suspect had also called 911 himself and made ""incriminating statements"" about his actions. When an officer tracked him down to a wooded area at the end of a residential road, he stabbed himself in the neck. He then lay down on top of a tarpaulin, which police said he had placed over Bianca's body, all the while taking and posting more photographs online. After a brief struggle, the suspect was arrested and taken to hospital. A day later, after emergency surgery, he was charged with Bianca's murder. Instagram has not confirmed when it received the first reports about the violent image on the suspect's public story. But as Sunday rolled on, word was beginning to spread beyond Bianca's social group, much of it clouded by misinformation. By Sunday evening, users on Twitter had started to talk about and re-share the Instagram posts. Other users implored people to avoid watching his story and report the account. From the outset, users said their reporting attempts were being rejected for not violating Instagram's terms. When approached by the BBC, Instagram did not say how long the original posts on the suspect's story had been allowed to stay up, but screenshots suggest they had been publicly available for more than 20 hours. Dr James Densley, a professor of criminal justice in Minnesota, said this kind of public violence carried the risk of secondary trauma for viewers, and also re-victimised Bianca herself. ""We have this term for people to rest in peace,"" he told the BBC. ""Well, really, she can't, because she's living in this sort of perpetual infamy online every time her image is shared."" Some of the first people to discuss the murder were users on website 4chan - a barely moderated internet messageboard where users can post anonymously. Both it, and the even more extreme website 8chan, have become notorious in recent years for the increasingly radical rhetoric posted by some users and their links to a number of deadly attacks. Bianca Devins murder images flood Instagram Social media's role in Christchurch attacks Social media sites struggle to contain attack video Before 51 people were shot dead in two Christchurch mosques in March, a manifesto in the suspected gunman's name was posted to 8chan. He also live-streamed the shooting on Facebook, telling viewers at the start of the attack to ""Subscribe to PewDiePie"". This ironic meme, about a popular YouTuber, also appears to have been used by the Utica suspect after he posted images of Bianca's murder to Discord. This and other comments attributed to the Utica suspect during the attack echoed the language being used in these extreme online communities, Robert Evans, an investigative journalist who specialises in radicalisation online, told the BBC. Both the suspect and Bianca are said to have used 4chan themselves in the past. Users on the forum on Sunday celebrated ""another 4chan murder"" and discussed her death in offensive and misogynistic terms, victim-blaming and even photoshopping the graphic images of her into sadistic memes. People have used #RIPBianca to share positivity online after her death - including artwork Evans said violent images and language like this were ""extremely common"" on these platforms. He compared the way that some young men were being radicalised on these websites to how terror groups recruit. ""All you have to do is shotgun out propaganda in the hopes that a couple of times a year, one individual will have enough commitment and hate in their heart to do something,"" he told the BBC. He believes law-enforcement need to take radicalisation on these websites more seriously. ""I don't think IS would get away with proliferating in a place like 8chan,"" he said. ""But at the same time - the internet is what is. And I don't know how you could police every dark little corner of it. This is a very 21st Century problem - and it's not one with a roadmap to solve it."" Dr Densley said these websites have become a place where otherwise ""lost souls"" are able to congregate. ""These are views that in polite society would be massively offensive,"" he told the BBC. ""I think because it's an echo chamber, these individuals talk up and amp up one another."" By Monday, when the police confirmed the images of Bianca were real, the case had already spilled from the fringes of the internet into mainstream social media. For hours #RIPBianca even trended on Twitter in the US. As the story proliferated, some people inevitably tried to search for the accounts and images being mentioned on their newsfeeds. With this attention, the number of Bianca's Instagram followers started to snowball. The teenager had been a heavy internet user, but some news outlets drastically overstated the scale of her following. Sensationalist headlines described the murder of an ""Instagram influencer"" or used the often derogatory and misogynist term ""e-girl"" to describe her. In reality, Bianca had only about 2,000 followers on her main Instagram account before the news of her killing went viral, according to tracking website SocialBlade. But in the week since, that number has increased to more than 160,000. The numbers of followers on Bianca's now-memorialised accounts continue to grow The suspect's account also attracted attraction. Despite his profile being edited to reflect his suicidal intentions at some point during the attack, Instagram did not deactivate it until the police confirmed his identity on Monday, more than a day after the murder. By that time, his following had grown by thousands and his profile was inundated with comments. Some people capitalised on Bianca's murder, which had already played out so publicly, as an opportunity to gain followers. Comments like: ""FOLLOW ME!!!& DM !! me for full video and picture"" were spammed on the suspect's posts. Dozens of users promised the images of her body were hidden within their private pages. Others tried to trick people into seeing cruel memes or even products they were trying to sell. Some even went as far as to change their username, or create brand-new accounts, to mimic the suspect's handle and lure people searching for the photographs. Instagram hides likes 'to remove pressure' Suicide note sparks plan to regulate influencers Instagram now asks bullies 'Are you sure?' One person behind one of these accounts, when challenged in a message about their motivations, said they had changed their name out of curiosity but did ""feel a little guilty"" for the victim and her family. They initially vowed to stop, but about an hour after abandoning the handle, reverted to it. Another person emulating the suspect's username told the BBC they did so ""for social media clout"", adding: ""People will do anything that gains them followers and some popularity."" On Tuesday, that user claimed to have amassed more than 1,000 follower requests and about 100 messages. They even considered trying to solicit online payments for the images, they said. Instagram told the BBC it was reviewing hashtags and accounts where people were claiming to share the graphic content. At the time of publication, most of these appeared to have been removed. Bianca's mother (right) said their family were ""devastated by the loss of our beautiful angel"" Dr Densley said cases like Bianca's exposed the ""weird incentive structures"" that exist across the social media we use every day. ""The entire enterprise is built on the number of likes and retweets and friends and followers that you can accumulate,"" he said, explaining that people who perpetrate violence online see the value in the online infamy it can bring. He said those who viewed the violent images then faced a choice: ""Do I report it? Do I ignore it and pretend I didn't see it? Or do I capture it in my own way, and then share it myself?"" The proliferation of images from Bianca's murder has renewed scrutiny of the way social media is policed day-to-day, just four months after platforms publicly struggled to contain the spread of graphic video from the Christchurch attacks. Sites like Instagram, Twitter and Facebook do have human moderators - but also rely on artificial intelligence technology and user reports to support their systems. The scale of their membership, which in Instagram's case is one billion users a month, makes for an overwhelming challenge. ""They use a technique called hashing - which very basically creates a digital fingerprint of an image or video,"" BBC technology reporter Zoe Kleinman explains. ""This means anything bearing that fingerprint can be automatically flagged and removed, or even blocked at the point of upload."" ""But, it only works if the original material is copied in its entirety. If an image or video is edited or clipped, the ""fingerprint"" is no longer complete and it can be more difficult to identify."" The teenager had recently graduated from high school Bianca's case, after that of Christchurch, will do little to alleviate mounting pressure on social platforms from international governments. The UK and Australia have announced new measures where social media companies may face fines, or even criminal charges, if they fail to moderate adequately. So far this year, Facebook executives have already introduced new restrictions on their live-streaming tool. Instagram also launched new anti-bullying initiatives and a crackdown against self-harm content after the suicide of a British teenager. Social media companies have reiterated their commitment to their community guidelines since Bianca's death. Despite this, some graphic content is still slipping through the net. At the time of publication, the BBC found even the most graphic photographs of Bianca's body - posted up to a week ago - still on Twitter. The day after her murder, Bianca's stepmother condemned those sharing the graphic images as ""disgusting"". ""I will FOREVER have those images in my mind when I think of her. When I close my eyes, those images haunt me,"" she posted on Facebook, urging people to consider the feelings of the family and report offensive content. Many have done so. And many have gone even further, demonstrating how online communities can act as a force for good. An online spamming war has been launched against those trying to exploit Bianca's death. Accounts have sprung up to flood tags being used to share graphic photographs and cruel memes of the teenager. The grassroots campaign vowed to turn Instagram #PinkForBianca Instead, tens of thousands of pastel-coloured cloudscapes, flowers, hearts and photographs of cute animals - in the style of Bianca's own selfies - now fill her tagged posts. Most accounts appear to be run by girls of a similar age to Bianca, who appear to be spending hours on the effort. Often the accounts come with offers of emotional support to others and guidance on how to report upsetting content. One teenage girl called Taylor has shared almost 1,000 ""filler"" images on the account she set up. ""Seeing the images plastered online broke my heart,"" she said in a private message from her account. ""I wanted to do whatever I could to protect her and her family."" A 19 year old named Brianna is among those who created artwork of Bianca as part of the fight to flush out the graphic posts. ""I'm glad that her family know that amongst the horror, people still care,"" she told the BBC. Naomi, 21, who is running another ""cute clean-up"" page, agreed: ""I just couldn't let these monsters win."" Bianca's mother Kimberly Devins is among those from her family who have embraced #PinkForBianca on their own social media accounts. In a statement released on Wednesday, she said: ""My heart is completely shattered, having lost my best friend. We will always remember her beautiful smile that lit up our lives. Her spirit will strengthen us and live on forever."" A vigil for Bianca Devins was held in Utica on Monday night As they prepared for Bianca's funeral, her family also launched a scholarship fund in her name, in the hope that others can fulfil her dream of helping young people with mental illness. Kimberly Devins has thanked those who shared support for the family, and implored people to continue spreading the message of ""love, not violence"" in her daughter's name.

"Young people may enjoy visiting the seaside but do they want to live there? Four in 10 coastal communities in England could see a decline in the number of residents aged under 30 by the year 2039. Analysis by BBC News of population projections has found seaside towns in northern England could see the biggest decline in under-30s. The Parliamentary Group for Coastal Communities said funding cuts meant seaside towns were ""being left behind"". The government said it had invested more than Â£200m in coastal communities. The coastline in England is home to some of the most beautiful but also poorest places in England. Some young adults living in the North Yorkshire town of Scarborough said they struggled to envisage a future for themselves living by the sea. Kayleigh Wilkinson said lots of friends had moved away from Scarborough because of a lack of jobs ""There aren't many career options in Scarborough,"" said 24-year-old Kayleigh Wilkinson. ""You either work in a care home like I do, or you work in a shop. ""That's one of the many reasons why people my age are already leaving to work in bigger cities like York and Leeds."" The Office for National Statistics (ONS) producespopulation projections based on previous and current demographic trends,external, including how many people have moved away from areas in previous years as well as birth and death rates. According to these figures, Scarborough could see a 7% fall in the number of people under 30 living in the area by 2039, meaning a potential fall of some 2,000 children and young adults over the next two decades.

Ryan Broadbent, 21, moved from Scarborough to Leeds to study at university and said he could not see himself returning to the town. ""If you spend Â£30,000 on going to university the last thing you want to do is move back to a place where you can only find a low skilled job,"" he said. ""It's not just jobs, there's very little to do at the weekend for young people. We were promised a multi-screen cinema in Scarborough but that hasn't happened."" Coastal towns like Scarborough once attracted hundreds of thousands of visitors every summer Twenty-year-old Reece Wilde was more optimistic about the future of the town, having just opened a cafe in the centre of Scarborough. ""I love this place and I think there are positive things happening,"" he said. ""There are people like me setting up independent bars and coffee shops. ""But what Scarborough and other seaside places need to do is think of what they can offer people all year round, instead of just in the summer."" Eight million people currently live in local authority areas in England with a coastline BBC News has analysed the population projections made by the ONS for 75 local authorities in England with a coastline. Thirty of them could see a fall in the number of residents under the age of 30 by the year 2039. The biggest decline in the number of under-30s could be in the north of England, with Copeland and Barrow-in-Furness in Cumbria and Northumberland all seeing a fall of more than 10% in the number of young people and children. In contrast, coastal authorities in the south, such as Bristol (+15%), Southampton (+7%) and Canterbury (+6%) could see substantial rises in the number of children and young people.

"This video can not be played President Zelensky: Snap poll ""more important"" than presidential vote President Volodymyr Zelensky is set to become the first Ukrainian leader since the fall of communism to command an overall majority in parliament. Servant of the People, the party named after the TV sitcom that made him famous, has won 43.1% of the vote with almost 94% of results counted. The party is on course to win 253 of parliament's 450 seats. A decisive win for Mr Zelensky's party will make it easier for him to push through reforms and tackle corruption. It will also be the best result by any party in Ukraine's post-1991 history. Since he triumphed in April's presidential poll, Mr Zelensky, 41, has been unable to appoint the ministers he wants. On Sunday, 424 seats in the parliament, the Verkhovna Rada, were contested. Those seats not included represent the war-torn Donbas region and Crimea, which was annexed from Ukraine by Russia in 2014. Rock stars and wrestlers: Ukraine election produces colourful cast Why Zelensky needs second election win What does a comic president mean for Ukraine? Speaking outside a polling station after casting his ballot in Kiev on Sunday, Mr Zelensky told the BBC's Steve Rosenberg the snap election was ""maybe more important than the presidential election"". His party was on course to win 124 seats in the party list vote, which is decided by proportional representation. It was also set to win a further 129 seats in single-seat races that make up half the vote. Five parties look on course to clear the 5% threshold to enter parliament, with the pro-Russian Opposition Platform-For Life party in second place with 13%. The Holos (Voice) party, seen as a possible coalition partner for Mr Zelensky should he need one, has so far won 5.8% of the vote. Svyatoslav Vakarchuk, lead singer of the popular band Okean Elzy, heads the Holos party The other two parties projected to enter parliament are former President Petro Poroshenko's European Solidarity (8.1%) and Batkivshchyna (Fatherland) led by former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko (8.2%). The victorious party or coalition will form a government and nominate a prime minister. The president is in charge of foreign policy, defence and security but parliament handles nearly all other policy areas, notably the economy and social welfare A majority of MPs propose a prime minister-designate to the president The PM, if confirmed by president and parliament, names members of the government Parliament confirms or rejects the government team, or indeed individual ministers, and can impeach the president MPs have a veto on key state posts such as national security service chief, central bank chief and chief prosecutor The president told our correspondent the ""president, prime minister and parliament have to work together, just to make life happy for Ukraine"". He said the key issues were investment, democracy and safety. Mr Zelensky was known for his comic role on TV as a teacher who wins the heart of the nation and becomes president after his expletive-laden rant about politics goes viral. In reality, his route to the leadership was a bit more conventional than in his show - but only a bit. After shunning rallies and speeches and openly admitting he did not have any strong political views, he scored a landslide victory in April and unseated Mr Poroshenko, a political heavyweight. Petro Poroshenko's party was rebranded European Solidarity to remove his name The election was widely expected to give Mr Zelensky a greater mandate for reform, sweeping aside the old guard and bringing new faces to parliament. One of the candidates for Servant of the People, for example, is Zhan Beleniuk, a 28-year-old Olympic wrestler who has now become Ukraine's first mixed race MP.

"This video can not be played Simon Coveney: Ireland would have to protect its place in the EU single market If the new UK prime minister wants to ""tear up"" the existing withdrawal agreement with the EU ""we're in trouble"", Ireland's deputy PM has said. Simon Coveney said the decision for a no-deal Brexit would be the UK's but added checks ""of some sorts"" would be needed in the Irish Republic. Ireland would have to protect its place in the single market, he told the BBC. Both men vying to become UK PM say they want to change the withdrawal deal and, in particular, the so-called backstop. Mr Coveney warned: ""That's a little bit like saying, 'Give me what I want or I'm going to burn the house down for everybody.'""

However, he warned it could not be removed from the withdrawal agreement. Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop 10 things that stopped Brexit happening PM candidates' backstop remarks 'significant' ""The EU has made it very clear that we want to engage with the new British prime minister, we want to avoid a no-deal Brexit but the solutions that have been put in place to do that haven't changed,"" Mr Coveney said. ""If the British government forces a no-deal Brexit on everybody else, the Republic of Ireland will have no choice but to protect its own place in the EU single market. That would fundamentally disrupt the all-Ireland economy."" He said the all-Ireland economy had helped maintain peace on the island of Ireland but that protecting it would ""not be possible"" in the event of a no-deal Brexit. However, he added that contingency plans were being drawn up with the European Commission to try to minimise the disruption. Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt have said they would keep no deal on the table to strengthen negotiations But former Tory leader and Brexiteer Iain Duncan Smith said both the EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier and the Irish prime minister had told him there would be no hard border with Northern Ireland in the event of a no-deal Brexit. ""I asked, well, lay out what your proposals are - and we'd already proposed alternative arrangements - and basically what was described to me was alternative arrangements - the same thing we'd been talking to them about which would alleviate the idea of necessary checks on the island of Ireland based on what exists at the moment,"" Mr Duncan Smith said. AndDUP leader Arlene Foster said she was ""disappointed, but not surprised"" by what Mr Coveneyhad said, and accused him of trying to ""look tough"" in the eyes of the incoming prime minister. The DUP, whose 10 MPs are crucial for the Conservative Party's majority, has said it does not want the UK to leave the EU without a deal, but believes ruling out no-deal would damage the UK's negotiating hand. By Jayne McCormack, BBC Northern Ireland's political reporter Much of what Simon Coveney had to say today mirrored his warnings in the past. No time limit on the backstop, there is wiggle room on the political declaration and no deal would be a disaster for the economy. But there was one key difference this time - his intended recipient of the message. The Irish government is acutely aware that the incoming prime minister is likely to want to make good on his Brexit strategy. No deal is still on the table. The Republic of Ireland has managed to keep the EU on board and its backstop argument has not changed - but can it hold the line? This was also the clearest interview from Mr Coveney yet - stressing if a no-deal Brexit does happen, the blame rests with Westminster, not Dublin. DUP leader Arlene Foster hit back that the Irish deputy prime minister was trying to ""look tough"" to the new PM. In the coming days, we will likely see much more ""tough talk"" emerging from both sides. The withdrawal agreement has been rejected three times by MPs in the Commons, with the backstop a key sticking point among Brexiteers. The two men vying to become the next prime minister, Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt, have said the backstop is ""dead"" - a position seen as increasing the likelihood of a no-deal Brexit. If MPs fail to support a Brexit deal agreed between UK and EU by 31 October, the legal default is to leave with no deal on that date. Both contenders to be the next prime minister have said they want to leave on that date and renegotiate with the EU, leaving with a deal. But Mr Hunt and Mr Johnson have also said they would keep the possibility of no deal on the table to strengthen negotiations, despite Parliament voting to rule the option out.

He said a no-deal Brexit, something Mr Johnson has left open as an option, was ""not something I could ever sign up to"". Asked if he thought he would be sacked next week, Mr Hammond said he would resign on Wednesday to Theresa May. He said he intends to quit after Prime Minister's Questions but before Mrs May steps down. Speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, Mr Hammond said it was important the next PM and his chancellor were ""closely aligned"" on Brexit policy. Mr Johnson has said the UK must leave the EU by the new Brexit deadline of 31 October ""do or die, come what may"". His leadership rival Jeremy Hunt has said a no-deal exit cannot be ruled out, but he is prepared to further delay Brexit if required to get a new withdrawal deal. Mr Hammond said the situation ""might be more complicated"" if Mr Hunt wins the Tory leadership contest, but ""all the polling"" suggested Mr Johnson would succeed. Johnson's 'deal or no deal' challenge to Hunt Hammond says UK 'can't control no-deal Brexit' Tory leadership candidates compared: Johnson v Hunt ""That is what is likely to happen, and I'm making my plans accordingly"", he said, adding he would wait until the result is announced on Tuesday to ""see for sure"". Mr Hammond said he understood committing to leave by this date, even with no deal, would be a condition for serving in Mr Johnson's cabinet. He said: ""That is not something I could ever sign up to. It's very important that a prime minister is able to have a chancellor that is closely aligned with him in terms of policy"". He added that Jeremy Hunt's position regarding a no-deal Brexit was ""more nuanced"", and he had not demanded a ""loyalty pledge"" on the exit date from prospective ministers. Mr Hammond said he would support either man in their pursuit of a new Brexit deal, but it would not be possible to agree this before the end of October. ""A genuine pursuit of a deal will require a little longer"", he added. Either Jeremy Hunt (l) or Boris Johnson (r) will become PM next week Mr Hammond has been a prominent critic of the idea of a no-deal Brexit,recently indicatinghe may vote to bring down the next PM to stop such a scenario. He had said he could ""not exclude anything"" when asked whether he would back a motion of no-confidence in the government. Asked whether he would go against the next PM in a vote of no confidence, he said: ""I don't think it will get to that"". ""I am confident that Parliament does have a way of preventing a no-deal exit on October 31 without parliamentary consent"". ""I intend to work with others to ensure Parliament uses its power to make sure that the new government can't do that"", he added.

The votes haven't been counted - but already Westminster is preparing for Prime Minister Johnson. It's not a surprise that Philip Hammond has decided not to serve in a Johnson government. But the manner of the announcement - live on television, hammering Mr Johnson's key policy on Brexit so publicly - shows just how deep divisions in the Tory Party run. Justice Secretary David Gauke has confirmed he'll quit too if Mr Johnson wins - and others are likely to follow. There is an element of jumping before they are pushed.

"This video can not be played President Zelensky: Snap poll ""more important"" than presidential vote President Volodymyr Zelensky is set to become the first Ukrainian leader since the fall of communism to command an overall majority in parliament. Servant of the People, the party named after the TV sitcom that made him famous, has won 43.1% of the vote with almost 94% of results counted. The party is on course to win 253 of parliament's 450 seats. A decisive win for Mr Zelensky's party will make it easier for him to push through reforms and tackle corruption. It will also be the best result by any party in Ukraine's post-1991 history. Since he triumphed in April's presidential poll, Mr Zelensky, 41, has been unable to appoint the ministers he wants. On Sunday, 424 seats in the parliament, the Verkhovna Rada, were contested. Those seats not included represent the war-torn Donbas region and Crimea, which was annexed from Ukraine by Russia in 2014. Rock stars and wrestlers: Ukraine election produces colourful cast Why Zelensky needs second election win What does a comic president mean for Ukraine? Speaking outside a polling station after casting his ballot in Kiev on Sunday, Mr Zelensky told the BBC's Steve Rosenberg the snap election was ""maybe more important than the presidential election"". His party was on course to win 124 seats in the party list vote, which is decided by proportional representation. It was also set to win a further 129 seats in single-seat races that make up half the vote. Five parties look on course to clear the 5% threshold to enter parliament, with the pro-Russian Opposition Platform-For Life party in second place with 13%. The Holos (Voice) party, seen as a possible coalition partner for Mr Zelensky should he need one, has so far won 5.8% of the vote. Svyatoslav Vakarchuk, lead singer of the popular band Okean Elzy, heads the Holos party The other two parties projected to enter parliament are former President Petro Poroshenko's European Solidarity (8.1%) and Batkivshchyna (Fatherland) led by former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko (8.2%). The victorious party or coalition will form a government and nominate a prime minister. The president is in charge of foreign policy, defence and security but parliament handles nearly all other policy areas, notably the economy and social welfare A majority of MPs propose a prime minister-designate to the president The PM, if confirmed by president and parliament, names members of the government Parliament confirms or rejects the government team, or indeed individual ministers, and can impeach the president MPs have a veto on key state posts such as national security service chief, central bank chief and chief prosecutor The president told our correspondent the ""president, prime minister and parliament have to work together, just to make life happy for Ukraine"". He said the key issues were investment, democracy and safety. Mr Zelensky was known for his comic role on TV as a teacher who wins the heart of the nation and becomes president after his expletive-laden rant about politics goes viral. In reality, his route to the leadership was a bit more conventional than in his show - but only a bit. After shunning rallies and speeches and openly admitting he did not have any strong political views, he scored a landslide victory in April and unseated Mr Poroshenko, a political heavyweight. Petro Poroshenko's party was rebranded European Solidarity to remove his name The election was widely expected to give Mr Zelensky a greater mandate for reform, sweeping aside the old guard and bringing new faces to parliament. One of the candidates for Servant of the People, for example, is Zhan Beleniuk, a 28-year-old Olympic wrestler who has now become Ukraine's first mixed race MP.

"In 2017, most drug-related deaths involved heroin but a large percentage had also taken pills The Home Office has been urged to take part in an emergency summit about Scotland's record drugs deaths. The number of drug-related deaths in Scotland soared to 1,187 last year, the highest rate since records began in 1996. Scotland's Public Health Minister Joe FitzPatrick has said he will host a summit in Glasgow to discuss the crisis. Mr FitzPatrick has invited the UK government to take part. Scotland has highest drug death rate in EU What can be done about Scotland's drugs crisis? Scotland's drug death crisis in six charts In his letter to the Home Secretary Sajid Javid, Mr FitzPatrick described the ""tragic"" increase in drugs deaths as ""unacceptable"" and added: ""I take seriously the impact this has on individuals, families and communities."" Mr FitzPatrick wrote: ""In response to these shocking statistics, I am inviting the UK government to work with the Scottish government to tackle this problem which claims so many lives."" Asking for a government minister to attend a proposed emergency summit - expected to be held in Glasgow - about the problem, he added: ""The Scottish government has already agreed that we will host such a summit, where government representatives, local authorities and the chair of Scotland's new drug deaths taskforce would be invited, ensuring the voices of those with experience of using drugs, and their families, are also heard. ""I understand that there is cross-party support for this conversation, including from [Scottish Conservative] Miles Briggs MSP, who has written to me to offer his support."" Public Health Minister Joe FitzPatrick said the deaths were an ""emergency"" Mr Briggs, the Scottish Conservative health spokesman, described the situation as a ""national emergency"" and called for ""serious and detailed conversation"". He said: ""This is a crisis that spans political divides, so we would hope that both Scottish and UK governments are involved."" The Home Office said it would be responding to Mr FitzPatrick's letter in due course and a spokesman added: ""Any death related to drug misuse is a tragedy. ""The causes of drug misuse are complex and need a range of policy responses and many of the powers to deal with drug dependency such as healthcare, housing and criminal justice are devolved in Scotland. ""We are combating the illicit drug trade with the National Crime Agency and Border Force working to prevent serious organised crime and importation across Scotland.

"This video can not be played Footage released by Iran's Revolutionary Guard-affiliated Fars news agency appears to show Stena Impero being seized The foreign secretary has urged Iran to reverse its ""illegal"" seizure of a British-flagged tanker in the Gulf. Jeremy Hunt said it ""raises very serious questions"" about the security of British and international shipping in the Strait of Hormuz. It comes as Iran released new footage of the capture on Friday of the Stena Impero. Tehran said the vessel was ""violating international maritime rules"". Speaking after a phone call with his Iranian counterpart, Mr Hunt said Iran viewed this as a ""tit-for-tat situation"" following the detention of an Iranian tanker in Gibraltar. But he said ""nothing could be further from the truth"". The Stena Impero's owners said they wanted access at the port of Bandar Abbas to the 23 crew members, who they said are in good health. BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner said it appears the Iranian Revolutionary Guard was ""quite prepared to push this right up to the brink of a conflict, yet probably stopping just short of one"". The Stena Impero was seized by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard on Friday in a key shipping route in the Gulf. Footage emerged on Saturday appearing to show the moment the tanker was raided. It was released by Iran's Revolutionary Guard-affiliated Fars news agency. It shows masked forces dropping down ropes onto the ship from a helicopter after it was surrounded by high-speed vessels. A Royal Navy frigate, HMS Montrose, was alerted and raced to intervene, as it did - successfully - with another British-flagged tanker just over a week ago. But this time it was too far away to stop the Stena Impero being seized - the tanker was already in Iranian waters. Iran's state-run IRNA news agency said the tanker was captured after it collided with a fishing boat and failed to respond to calls from the smaller craft. But Mr Hunt said it was seized in Omani waters in ""clear contravention of international law"" and then forced to sail into Iran. The Stena Impero's Swedish owners, Stena Bulk, said it had been fully complying with regulations and had been in international waters at the time. It said the crew members, who are Indian, Russian, Latvian and Filipino, were in good health. A second British-owned Liberian-flagged tanker, the MV Mesdar, was also boarded by armed guards on the same day but was released. It came after Royal Marineshelped seize Iranian tanker Grace 1off Gibraltar earlier this month, because of evidence it was carrying oil to Syria in breach of EU sanctions. Iran described the incident as ""piracy"" but Mr Hunt said the Grace 1 was detained legally in Gibraltarian waters ""totally within the law"". This video can not be played Jeremy Hunt says Iran views the tanker seizure as a ""tit-for-tat situation"" On Saturday, UK government ministers held an emergency meeting of Cobra and a senior Iranian diplomat was summoned to the Foreign Office in London. Afterwards, Mr Hunt said MPs would be updated on Monday about what ""further measures"" the government would take, adding the threat level had been raised to the highest level of alert. ""Our priority continues to be to find a way to de-escalate the situation,"" he said. A UK government spokeswoman said earlier it had advised UK shipping to stay out of the area. Iran's foreign minister Javad Zarif tweeted,externalthat the UK ""must cease being an accessory to #EconomicTerrorism of the US"". He said it was Iran that guarantees the security of the Gulf and the Strait of Hormuz. This video can not be played Why does the Strait of Hormuz matter? ""Unlike the piracy in the Strait of Gibraltar, our action in the Persian Gulf is to uphold international maritime rules,"" he said. Abbasali Kadkhodaei, spokesman of the state watchdog the Guardian Council,said on Twitter,externalthat ""the law of retaliation is a recognised concept in international law"" shortly after the ship's seizure was announced. The latest developments come amid a deterioration in relations between Iran and the UK and US. Tensions between the US and Iran have risen sharply since April, when the US tightened sanctions it had reimposed on Iran after unilaterally withdrawing from a 2015 nuclear deal. The US blamed Iran for attacks on tankers in the world's key shipping area since May - Tehran denies all the accusations. On Friday,the US claimed to have destroyed an Iranian drone in the Gulf. Unlike the US, the UK government remains committed to the nuclear deal, which curbs Iran's nuclear activities in return for the lifting of sanctions tensions. However, the UK's decision to helpseize the Iranian tankerGrace 1 off Gibraltar earlier this month infuriated Iran. On Friday, Gibraltar granted a 30-day extension to allow authorities to continue detaining the tanker, which was suspected of carrying oil to Syria in breach of EU sanctions. In retaliation for this seizure Iranhad threatened to seize a British oil tanker. A week later, Iranian boats attempted to impede a British oil tanker in the region before being warned off by a Royal Navy ship, according to the Ministry of Defence.  Iran denied any attempted seizure. A White House National Security Council spokesman said the latest incident on Friday was the second time in just over a week the UK had been ""the target of escalatory violence"" by Iran. And US Central Command said it was developing a multinational maritime effort in response to the situation. The US military said it wanted to promote maritime stability, ensure safe passage, and de-escalate tensions in international waters throughout the Arabian Gulf, Strait of Hormuz, the Bab el-Mandeb Strait and the Gulf of Oman. The Pentagon has saidUS troops are being deployed to Saudi Arabiato defend American interests in the region from ""emergent credible threats"". France and Germany called on the Iranian authorities to quickly release the Stena Impero. Also calling for the release of the ship, the European Union's foreign affairs office, which represents 28 member states, expressed ""deep concern"" and urged for ""restraint to avoid further tensions"". The BBC's Frank Gardner said the British government was in a ""bit of a bind"" because ministers do not have a great deal of options left. He said: ""What they would like to do is to have a firm, international response, preferably done through allies, possibly with the UN."" The first thing to remember is that this specific row between Tehran and London is only one aspect of an already highly volatile situation in the Gulf. The Trump administration's decision to walk away fromthe international nuclear deal with Iranand to re-apply sanctions is having a hugely damaging impact on the Iranian economy. Iran is pushing back. Given the highly fragile and volatile situation in the Gulf, together with the desperate need to bolster the flagging Iran nuclear deal, was it sensible to detain the vessel carrying Iranian oil off Gibraltar? Read more analysis from Jonathan,external Ships must fly the flag of a nation state, explains Richard Meade, managing editor of maritime intelligence publication Lloyd's List. They must be registered in a country, but that doesn't have to be the same country as its owners, or have any relation to the cargo, he says. But there must be some link to the UK. ""But how you define UK is relative,"" Mr Meade says. The Stena Impero is Swedish-owned and those on board are Indian, Russian, Latvian and Filipino. But it's the UK flag that is important symbolically, he says. ""Historically speaking it means that the UK owes protection to the vessel."" ""The UK has political responsibilities to anything that is flagged. And that's why it's much more serious than if there just happened to be a British captain on board."" He emphasises that while it was a political issue, the impact on trade in the region had so far been minimal. But he warns that if the international community began viewing the Strait of Hormuz as a dangerous place to be, that could create a ""very different"" scenario. The seizing of a British-flagged tanker in Omani waters, empty and inbound to a Saudi port, marks a serious escalation in a whole catalogue of recent incidents in the Gulf. It comes on the back of the mysterious mining of tankers, the downing of both US and Iranian drones and the near capture of another British-flagged tanker only a few days ago. Britain wants its response be two things: Measured and multinational. The government is trying to send a robust message to Iran that this action is unacceptable, not just to the UK but to the rest of the world, but not so robust that it ends up being part of an avoidable US military strike. This has become a highly volatile situation where not everyone believes in diplomacy. There are figures in Washington who have been pushing for an ever-tougher line with Iran. And there are figures in Iran, notably in the Revolutionary Guards Corps and the security apparatus, who are quite prepared to push this right up to the brink of a conflict, yet probably stopping just short of one.

"This video can not be played Simon Coveney: Ireland would have to protect its place in the EU single market If the new UK prime minister wants to ""tear up"" the existing withdrawal agreement with the EU ""we're in trouble"", Ireland's deputy PM has said. Simon Coveney said the decision for a no-deal Brexit would be the UK's but added checks ""of some sorts"" would be needed in the Irish Republic. Ireland would have to protect its place in the single market, he told the BBC. Both men vying to become UK PM say they want to change the withdrawal deal and, in particular, the so-called backstop. Mr Coveney warned: ""That's a little bit like saying, 'Give me what I want or I'm going to burn the house down for everybody.'"" He told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show he hoped the UK and EU would negotiate a future relationship that would mean the backstop - designed as an insurance policy to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland - could be avoided. However, he warned it could not be removed from the withdrawal agreement. Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop 10 things that stopped Brexit happening PM candidates' backstop remarks 'significant' ""The EU has made it very clear that we want to engage with the new British prime minister, we want to avoid a no-deal Brexit but the solutions that have been put in place to do that haven't changed,"" Mr Coveney said. ""If the British government forces a no-deal Brexit on everybody else, the Republic of Ireland will have no choice but to protect its own place in the EU single market. That would fundamentally disrupt the all-Ireland economy."" He said the all-Ireland economy had helped maintain peace on the island of Ireland but that protecting it would ""not be possible"" in the event of a no-deal Brexit. However, he added that contingency plans were being drawn up with the European Commission to try to minimise the disruption. Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt have said they would keep no deal on the table to strengthen negotiations But former Tory leader and Brexiteer Iain Duncan Smith said both the EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier and the Irish prime minister had told him there would be no hard border with Northern Ireland in the event of a no-deal Brexit. ""I asked, well, lay out what your proposals are - and we'd already proposed alternative arrangements - and basically what was described to me was alternative arrangements - the same thing we'd been talking to them about which would alleviate the idea of necessary checks on the island of Ireland based on what exists at the moment,"" Mr Duncan Smith said. AndDUP leader Arlene Foster said she was ""disappointed, but not surprised"" by what Mr Coveneyhad said, and accused him of trying to ""look tough"" in the eyes of the incoming prime minister. The DUP, whose 10 MPs are crucial for the Conservative Party's majority, has said it does not want the UK to leave the EU without a deal, but believes ruling out no-deal would damage the UK's negotiating hand. By Jayne McCormack, BBC Northern Ireland's political reporter Much of what Simon Coveney had to say today mirrored his warnings in the past. No time limit on the backstop, there is wiggle room on the political declaration and no deal would be a disaster for the economy. But there was one key difference this time - his intended recipient of the message. The Irish government is acutely aware that the incoming prime minister is likely to want to make good on his Brexit strategy. No deal is still on the table. The Republic of Ireland has managed to keep the EU on board and its backstop argument has not changed - but can it hold the line? This was also the clearest interview from Mr Coveney yet - stressing if a no-deal Brexit does happen, the blame rests with Westminster, not Dublin. DUP leader Arlene Foster hit back that the Irish deputy prime minister was trying to ""look tough"" to the new PM. In the coming days, we will likely see much more ""tough talk"" emerging from both sides. The withdrawal agreement has been rejected three times by MPs in the Commons, with the backstop a key sticking point among Brexiteers. The two men vying to become the next prime minister, Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt, have said the backstop is ""dead"" - a position seen as increasing the likelihood of a no-deal Brexit. If MPs fail to support a Brexit deal agreed between UK and EU by 31 October, the legal default is to leave with no deal on that date. Both contenders to be the next prime minister have said they want to leave on that date and renegotiate with the EU, leaving with a deal. But Mr Hunt and Mr Johnson have also said they would keep the possibility of no deal on the table to strengthen negotiations, despite Parliament voting to rule the option out. Mr Johnson has also refused to rule out suspending Parliament to force a no-deal Brexit through. This week, MPs backed abid to make it harder for a new prime minister to do this. A majority of 41 approved the amendment, with four cabinet ministers, including Chancellor Philip Hammond, abstaining.
