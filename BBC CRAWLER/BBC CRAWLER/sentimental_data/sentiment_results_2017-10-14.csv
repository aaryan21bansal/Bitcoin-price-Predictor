"Stillbirth is rarely spoken about. But insights from those who have navigated the heartbreaking experience can help parents come to terms with their grief. A new website, Stillbirth Stories, which collects detailed interviews with mothers, fathers and clinicians, has been launched to coincide with Baby Loss Awareness Week. It aims to nurture a conversation about a once-taboo subject. Here are extracts of some of those stories. ""There was a cold cot that I could put Jannah in. She could stay overnight. And that was really lovely - it was special."" At 41 weeks, Rabia went into labour. But in hospital, she and David were told there was no heartbeat. Jannah was stillborn. The couple were able to stay with their baby for two days in the hospital's bereavement suite. David recalls the time they spent together as a family: ""I was with her for two days in the hospital - they were absolutely amazing, what they did. They had their own bereavement suite, so you [could have] your own time with the baby. I never let Jannah be on her own at any moment. I wanted someone always with her - even though I knew she had gone. But I always felt that she had the right to be loved for those days - to be hugged and kissed and whatever, and not left alone. Like a baby. ""The bereavement suite had a double bed, so I could stay as well. It was like us three sleeping together. It was quite nice to have her with us as part of our family. We spent a lot of quality time with her [there]. We talked to her, made lots of videos, lots of photography, and tried to keep as much memory of her as [we] could. I don't know if it's odd or not, but I looked at every little part of her, right down to between her toes. ""I've got somewhere I can go, and I know she's there. I can put flowers on her grave - but it's not the same."" Alexis was stillborn at term. It was 1963 and neither Marjorie nor her husband, Alex, were allowed to see, or hold, their baby. It would be another 50 years before they found out where she had been buried. ""I knew Alex had to go and register the baby. I must have said to him: 'What are they going to do with her?' And he just said: 'Well, you know, they're going to have her buried.' We went to the hospital at one point and asked where she was, and they just said that she had been buried somewhere in Stockport, in one of the cemeteries. ""I'd started to have more children, and it was, you know, one day we will find her. Until the day came that we did go and look for her. ""We went to the big crematorium in Stockport, and they sent us to the central library. They said everything was on microfilm, and we looked through it and we found two burials around the time Alexis would have been taken there. She was born on the 15th [of April], there was just this one buried on the 17th - a girl of 31. And underneath it said: ""Stillborn"". So I knew they'd put a stillborn in the grave. And that's when we went back to the cemetery. I saw a different lady, and she said: 'Oh did they not get the little book out for you? We have a little book for all the stillborn babies.' She brought it, and it was there, and she gave us a grave number."" Stillbirth Stories,externalis a collection of honest interviews from parents and and those who have worked with them. Besides offering emotional support, the site is a learning resource for clinicians. The project is supported byWellcome,external. Why don't people talk more about stillbirths? ""We went to look for it, and couldn't find it. There was no stone, it was just grass. Eventually, I did ask if I could put something on [the grave]. They said: 'No. The grave belongs to somebody, it's registered to somebody. You can put flowers on, but no, you can't put anything else on.' So, for a while, I just bought something that you could stick in the grass and put flowers on. Then I got a bit angry about it. I've had a proper stone flowerpot with her name put on it. ""Over the other side [of the cemetery] is where all the babies are buried. And that haunts me - to think that she was just put in a grave with somebody that I don't know. I just hope and pray it never happens to anybody else, because it's one of the cruellest things you can do to a couple. I know I can go there and put flowers on for her, but it's not the same."" ""I bathed him for the funeral, which you do in Muslim culture."" Mohammed was stillborn at 27 weeks gestation. Parents Shazia and Omar decided to bury their baby according to the Muslim faith. Shazia says the hospital midwife appreciated the need to have the body released for the funeral as quickly as possible, and helped with the process. It was Omar who performed the Ghusl - or ritual bath - for the funeral. ""So it was just me and him, and a priest. That was the time, I guess, it was just us two. ""That was the toughest part of all of this for me. That's where, you know, you're sort of past the birth and it's the day of the burial, and the funeral. It's a duty that you need to do. At that time, I guess, religion sort of took on a different aspect for me. ""And it was this grief that actually cemented my religion a little bit: maturing and going through that experience, learning what you do when, when it's your responsibility for the funeral. That point where I was bathing him, was the point where I was close to totally breaking down. But I soldiered through - for want of a better phrase. ""Something that I'm proud of, is that me and Shazia made it through it, having seen some really, really low, low times, to where we are now."" At the time of interview Shazia and Omar had recently had their fourth child. ""I just want people to understand it's much more common than they think. There's like over 300 babies a month stillborn."" Guy was stillborn on 13 November 2015 at 25 weeks and five days, to parents Sam and Martin. ""We had a couple of close friends we'd told at the time [when Guy died]. I just physically couldn't even speak to get the words out to tell people. ""Once he was born, we just decided to use Facebook. We thought that is the quickest way to get the message out there and not have to speak to anybody really. ""I got such an overwhelming response from that. So many people messaged me privately to say that they'd had similar experiences; that they'd had losses, various stages, and that was - I want to say comforting, to know that there were other people out there. But I wondered why nobody had ever said anything. And even then, they were posting it privately to me and I thought, well, tell people. ""It was nice to know that they'd opened up and they'd gone on to have their own children, and were trying to put that little bit of hope out to us. ""People sharing their stories is the biggest help, the biggest comfort - because a lot of people will shy away from it. ""The thing about meeting people online, is that you don't know if they're who they say they are. But these were all genuine people sharing their stories. I ended up meeting a few [of them] at a memorial service. A couple of the girls that I was following were going, so we said we'd meet up there, just to put faces to the names, and the stories. Over the last few months, I've just found my own little group of friends ""I've put [Guy's] story out there quite a lot. I've done a lot of fundraising, mostly for Tommy's. Then we've done some for Aching Arms, because they're the charities we feel have helped us the most."" ""We had like a little selection of little knitted dresses, little gowns that a woman had made via a charity"" Petal was born at 23 weeks and 6 days of pregnancy to Aimee and Marc.  In the UK, the definition of 'stillborn' is a baby born with no signs of life at 24 or more weeks of gestation. Had Petal been born one day later she would have been legally 'stillborn'. ""Before I was induced, the bereavement midwife come round and she gave us a selection of clothes that Petal could have to wear. She was too small for babygros and things. We'd bought blankets and dolls and things for her [the day before], but none of the clothes would fit her. We had a selection of little knitted dresses, little gowns that a woman had made via a charity. It was really personal to be able to pick something for Petal to wear. So, when I delivered her, Marc bathed her and then dressed her in a little purple, pink gown, with a little hat and gloves. ""It was precious. It's all we have of her. That's the memory that I have of her that feels real - that she was really here. ""She was classed as a late miscarriage instead of a stillbirth. If she would have been born 22 hours later, I would have been able to register her and she would have had her own death certificate. We don't have any legal documentation for her. ""Sometimes I feel like that because she doesn't have a death certificate, she never existed. ""Since I lost Petal, I felt that people pitied me because of that experience, but I don't want to be defined as the mother who lost a child. I'm also a mother of three healthy children as well, who just wants to say that there is help out there for bereaved parents to carry on.""

"The deadline for spending your old pound coins is looming large, but what happens if you find a stash of cash after they're no longer legal tender? So you finally get around to lifting up the cushions on the sofa while vacuuming, and the good news is that you find some pound coins lurking in the nooks and crannies. This scenario is perfectly possible, with the Royal Mint estimating there are Â£500m of old-style coins still in circulation. The bad news is that after Sunday, the old pound coins can't be spent any more because they've been replaced with shinier, newer ones, which are harder to copy illegally. However, all is not lost - there are still a few ways you can use those tiny golden nuggets. Everything you need to know about the new Â£1 coin Melting down the old pound coins Race on to spend old Â£1 coins Poundland will wait a bit longer for people to crack open their piggy banks in the hunt for old coins The coin is king at the Poundland chain of shops, and 850 stores around the country will continue to accept the old pounds. Branded the ""Legal Tender Extender"", the initiative runs until 31 October. Poundland's managing director Barry Williams describes the chain as ""the official home of the pound"" (which may be news to the Treasury). He added: ""It's a no brainer that we offer all Brits the opportunity to spend their hard-earned round pounds for longer."" Hands up if you've found a shopping trolley that accepts the old pound coin Supermarkets are counting down to the changeover. Tesco says it will accept the old coins at the till and in its vending machines one week beyond the deadline, to ""do right"" by its customers. Lidl's trolleys can accept both new and old coins, but the old ones will not be accepted at their tills. However, Sainsbury's have taken the national deadline to heart. Its trolleys already now only accept the new pound coins, and old pound coins will not be accepted at its tills. The Federation of Small Businesses has advised its 170,000 member businesses to continue accepting the coinage ""at their discretion"". A spokesman added that many businesses ""could choose to continue accepting"", so long as they ""only bank them"" given the ""vast amount"" still in operation. If you find old pounds after the deadline, don't worry - Pudsey will take them off your hands The Royal British Legion is running the #poppypound campaign, making old pound coins available for donation until Remembrance Sunday on 12 November. The old coins can be taken to Legion branches in Plymouth, Southampton, Brighton, Swindon, Bristol, London, Colchester, Cardiff, Aylesbury, Derby, Birmingham, Belfast, Merseyside, Manchester, Leeds and Newcastle. And they'll be accepted by poppy sellers, who will be taking donations on the streets. Claire Rowcliffe, director of fundraising at the Legion, says the charity will be ""delighted to turn your out-of-date pounds into poppies"". Other charities are also running similar initiatives,external- these include the Rainbow Trust Children's Charity, Stratford Town Trust, Diabetes Research and Wellness Foundation, and Epilepsy Action. The new pound coins are harder to counterfeit The Money Saving Expert website reports,externalthat Barclays, Halifax, Lloyds, Nationwide Building Society, Natwest, RBS and Santander will continue to accept the old pounds. However, this will only be as deposits from their own customers. The word from the Post Office is that some branches will accept the old-style coins as deposits, but best to check if your local is one of the obliging branches. But before you go handing over those unloved coins, do take a closer look. Some specific types of the old pound coinare worth a lot more than just a quid.,externalThe Edinburgh City coin, for example, is worth up to Â£50 if it's in excellent condition. Perhaps you should check the kids' piggybank just one more time. Reporting by Mario Cacciottolo and  Alex Taylor Deadline for round pound coin passes What happens to our old pound coins?

"Pyongyangites go about their daily business with the Tower of Juche in the background North Korean media often dips into its own vocabulary to describe what's going on in the country, using words like ""Songun"" and ""Juche"" on a daily basis. These expressions appear as part of the glorification of its leadership, while colourful language such as ""thrice-cursed"" is used against the US, Japan and South Korea. As the communist country marks the founding anniversary of its ruling Workers' Party, here is a selection of some frequently-used ideological phrases and what they mean to the outside world... Songun is North Korea's military-first policy, started by then leader Kim Il-sung in 1960 as a way to rule the country. State media showered praise on his son and successor, the late Kim Jong-il, on 8 October this year to celebrate the 20th anniversary of him becoming the Workers' Party general secretary. ""His outstanding political calibre was fully displayed in strengthening the WPK into a guiding force of Songun (military-first) revolution"", a report in KCNA news agency said. ""The Day of Songun"" is a national holiday in North Korea, marked on 25 August. The Songun policy is being taken forward by Kim Jong-il's son and current leader Kim Jong-un, who has expedited the pace of the country's nuclear and missile programmes despite international warnings and sanctions. This refers to North Korea's ideology of self-reliance, named by founder Kim Il-sung. The word was also used extensively in state media coverage of the Workers' Party plenum held on 7 October. References included remarks by Kim Jong-un urging ""unyielding efforts"" to develop the economy and make it ""Juche-based"". A monument called the ""Juche Tower"" is located in Pyongyang. North Korea also uses the Juche Calendar, which came into effect in 1997. It starts with the birth of founder Kim Il-sung in April 1912. For example, the year 2017 is written as Juche 106 in state media reports. Kim Jong-un has expanded on Juche and Songun to justify the country's nuclear weapons programme This is North Korean leader Kim Jong-un's signature policy, which seeks simultaneous development of nuclear weapons and the economy. At a rare party congress in May 2016, Kim pledged to pursue the policy, which was first announced in 2013. At the recent party plenum on 7 October, Kim Jong-un said the ""prevailing situation and the reality"" had shown that the party was ""absolutely right"" to do so, KCNA reported. Chollima is an imaginary horse with wings which can run at least 400 km a day. North Korea launched the Chollima Movement in the late 1950s as an economic campaign to rebuild its economy after the 1950-53 Korean War. North Korea has a Chollima Steel Complex which is one of the biggest plants in the country. Mallima also refers to an imaginary horse, but one that can run very long distances at extremely fast speeds - 10 times faster than Chollima. The ""Speed of Mallima"" is often used in the media to coax North Koreans to work harder to achieve the country's economic goals. In March, ruling party paper Rodong Sinmun wrote: ""To be riders and front-runners in the Mallima movement is the bounden duty and noble obligation of our generations who were born in the motherland of Juche and grew up learning the epic of the Chollima age."" The Chollima horse is fast, but it's not Mollima Speed These words have been coined in praise of late leaders Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il, and refer to their philosophies of Songun and Juche. State media say these form the basis of the country's path and are responsible for its advances as a ""nuclear power"" despite threats by the US. ""Korean-style socialism has victoriously advanced along the orbit of Juche... which no formidable enemy dares to provoke. This is a clear proof of the validity and vitality of great Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism"", an article in Rodong Sinmun said in late March. Both leaders also have flowers named after them. A special orchid has been named Kimilsungia after the country's founder, while Kimjongilia is a red begonia. These campaigns are a method employed by the North Korean regime to mobilise its people to maximise production in a fixed period of time. In 2016, North Korea organised the so-called 70-day and 200-day campaigns of ""loyalty"", in an attempt to give out the impression that it was unaffected by international sanctions over its nuclear and missile tests. Similar campaigns are mentioned in the media in the event of droughts or floods to project the country's strength in overcoming natural disasters. Portraits of Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il hang from every public building and in every home This refers to a period of severe famine in North Korea in the 1990s, which led to the death of around three million people in the country. The phrase was used extensively in the state media in early 2017 to prepare the people for economic difficulties owing to international sanctions. The ruling Kim family is described as the ""Mt Paektu bloodline"" in the country. Only members of the Kim family (Kim Il-sung, Kim Jong-il and now Kim Jong-un) have ruled the country since its establishment in 1948. The phrase ""Mt Paektu bloodline"" is used to encourage ordinary North Koreans to pledge loyalty to their leadership. The ""Great persons of Mt Paektu"" are the three rulers of the Kim bloodline, plus Kim Jong-suk who was Kim Il-sung's first wife and Kim Jong-il's mother. Mount Paektu, on the Sino-North Korean border, is the highest peak on the Korean Peninsula. It is considered to be the mythical birthplace of the Korean people, and is also showcased as the ""sacred origin"" of Kim Il-sung's Korean revolution. According to North Korean propaganda, Kim Jong-il was born in Samjiyon on the mountain, although he's widely considered to have been born in Russia. Mount Paektu is a volcano which last erupted over 1,000 years ago This refers to a phrase used in the North Korean media which means that if a serious - usually ideological - crime is committed by a person, the punishment will be meted out to three generations of the family. The phrase has been used frequently to lash out at state enemies. Former South Korean President Park Geun-hye (already the daughter of thrice-cursed Park Chung-hee) has been attacked in North Korean media as ""paying dearly for her thrice-cursed crimes as she had turned south Korea into a graveyard of freedom"". US President Donald Trump was also on the end of KCNA's sharp tongue. It called his speech at the UN ""thrice-cursed sophism made by the mentally deranged hooligan"". This is a term used to describe the appearances by North Korean leaders. The activities are a useful way for North Korea watchers to track the leaders' whereabouts in the secretive society, and also get an insight into their health. State media regularly releases reports and photos on the activities of current leader Kim Jong-un. Interestingly, North Korean leaders are always quoted as giving guidance during their inspections of military or economic facilities, and are surrounded - without fail - bymen in uniform taking notes.

"While Marsha P Johnson may not be a household name, a fiery digital debate has started about who is ""allowed"" to bring her story to the screen. Johnson was a black transgender woman and outspoken advocate for transgender rights in the 1960s. Most famously, she was a key participant in the 1969 Stonewall riots in New York City. Many see those events, which broke out after a police raid at the Stonewall Inn, a prominent gay bar, as the start of the gay rights movement in the United States. Johnson's story is the subject of a new Netflix documentary by David France, an established filmmaker who's also gay and white. But France is not the only one who's been looking into the story. Reina Gossett, a black transgender filmmaker, claimed in anInstagram post,externalthat France's film used her research without permission. He has vehementlydenied these allegations,external. Gossett's post received thousands of likes and shares on social media, sparking a wider debate, with many arguing that France should not have made a film about Johnson - or at least that he should have backed Gossett's efforts to bring the story to light. Johnson is receiving a small flurry of attention right now, but in the early 1970s, some in the LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender) community tried to distance themselves from Johnson and other transgender and drag queen activists. In 1992, Johnson went missing and her body was found six days later in the Hudson River. Police at the time called it a suicide, a ruling which many in the community disputed - citing high levels of violence against transgender women. Gossett and France have approached telling Marsha P Johnson's largely forgotten history in very different ways. Gossett is working with filmmaker Sasha Wortzel on ""Happy Birthday Marsha"", a fictionalised short film on the hours leading up to the Stonewall riots. Whereas France's ""The Death and Life of Marsha P Johnson"" is a documentary following trans activist Victoria Cruz as she investigates the circumstances of Johnson's death. However, some on social media have argued France should have stepped aside and let Gossett, a member of the trans community, tell Johnson's story. Allow Twitter content?

Lourdes Hunter, founder of the Trans Women of Color Collective, a grassroots organisation based in Washington DC, described France's documentary as ""compelling,"" but felt that France should have used his position as an established filmmaker and a white man to promote the work of those in the black trans community. ""Stories about black trans women should be told by black trans women,"" she tells BBC Trending. Hunter added that France's proclaimed support of Gossett's film is not enough. ""People who have access to resources, have access to social capital, access to finances, their role in the movement is to leverage their access so that the people who are supposed to be telling these stories... who are actually living these lives, [their] voices can be elevated."" Listen to more on this story on BBC Trending radio Transgender train workers: 'Don't pity us' Why transgender Africans turned against a famous feminist Follow BBC Trending on Facebook,external France, however, said he felt creating this documentary was a way of atoning for some of his community's past mistakes. His production company gave money to Gossett and Wortzel, and he says he supported their project independently of his own film. ""For me to not go back, for me to not revisit that story about which I knew so much already, would align me with the people who were eliminating their narrative from our history,"" France says, adding that the stories of historically important figures belong to all of humanity. Gossett did not respond to BBC Trending's questions, but recently expanded on her initial post. ""As France's documentary starts to make its way to large audiences, I can't stop thinking about the voices that have been pushed aside in the process,"" she wrotein an article for Teen Vogue,external. ""Too often, people with resources who already have a platform become the ones to tell the stories of those at the margins rather than people who themselves belong to these communities."" The feminist site Jezebel hassince published a comprehensive rebuttal,externalto Gossett's initial allegations. France's documentary has received positive reviews from the mainstream media. According to Gossett, her film is still scheduled to premiere next year. But the online debate continues around who has the right to tell Marsha P Johnson's story.

"This video can not be played Hurricane Ophelia upgrades to category 3 The UK is set to experience the tail end of a category three hurricane with high temperatures and wind forecast. As a result of Hurricane Ophelia, parts of England could see temperatures reach 25C on Sunday beating the 15C average for mid-October. On Monday some areas of the UK will be hit with winds of up to 80mph (128km/h). The hurricane will be a storm when it hits the UK, exactly 30 years after the Great Storm of 1987 killed 18 people. On its way from the Azores in the Atlantic Ocean, Hurricane Ophelia is currently blowing winds of 115mph (185km/h) setting the record for the most eastern category three hurricane in the Atlantic. Category three hurricanes are defined as having wind speeds of between 111mph (179km/h) and 129mph (208km/h) and can cause major damage to well-built homes. Though it is forecast to gradually weaken later on Sunday, the US National Hurricane Center said Ophelia would still be blowing hurricane-force winds as it approaches Ireland on Monday. The Republic of Ireland's Met Officehas issued a red warning for counties in Munster and Connacht, predicting that coastal areas will be hit by winds in excess of 80mph (130km/h) from 09:00 BST on Monday until Tuesday. The ferocity of the hurricane will dissipate before it reaches the UK, but Ophelia's remnants are forecast to bring high winds in coastal areas. Western England, Northern Ireland and parts of Scotland will be most affected by the storm winds. Weather presenter Michael Fish is remembered for dismissing reports that a hurricane would hit the south of England in October 1987. The storm is often remembered for BBC Weather presenter Michael Fish dismissing reports that ""there was a hurricane on the way"". Although he was right, storm winds of 100mph did batter the south of England, leaving a trail of destruction. Eighteen people died and 15 million trees were destroyed as a result of the high winds. It is thought that the storm caused Â£1bn in damage to property and infrastructure. The Met Office has issued severe weather alerts ahead of Ophelia and has warned there could be potential power cuts, disruption to road and rail networks, and damage to buildings as a result of Monday's stormy weather. But parts of England will benefit from the warm temperatures brought by the storm, with areas as far up as Nottingham expected to hit highs of 21C on Monday. Clouds in central and southern England are expected to break up to provide sunny spells over the course of the weekend. Some parts of the country have been enjoying a ""mini heatwave"" already. Ian Senior tweeted a screenshot of the temperature in Cambourne, Cambridgeshire, which was 17C on Saturday morning. Jennie, who lives in Leeds, also wrote on Twitter that she never thought she would be ""walk[ing] around bare legged wearing a skirt and short sleeved T-shirt"" in mid-October. But some parts of the country were still waiting for the temperatures to improve. Martin Cluderay, from Swaledale in the Yorkshire Dales, posted an overcast scene from the town titled: ""Welcome to the heatwave."" West Scotland and Northern Ireland are forecast to receive heavy rainfall on Sunday. BBC Weather has tweeted that Monday will bring ""contrasting fortunes"" - wild and windy in some western areas, warm and breezy in the east. Allow Twitter content?

"Weinstein has already been suspended by Bafta in the UK The organisation behind the Oscars has voted to expel Harvey Weinstein following numerous allegations of sexual assault made against the film producer. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences said its board ""voted well in excess of the required two-thirds majority"" to expel him. Its members include Hollywood figures such as Tom Hanks and Whoopi Goldberg. Weinstein's films have received more than 300 Oscar nominations and won 81. In a statement, the Academy said governors voted to expel Weinstein ""not simply to separate ourselves from someone who does not merit the respect of his colleagues but also to send a message that the era of wilful ignorance and shameful complicity in sexually predatory behaviour and workplace harassment in our industry is over"". They added: ""What's at issue here is a deeply troubling problem that has no place in our society."" Exploring the casting couch culture of LA Harvey Weinstein: The accusers' stories Women in his own words The emergency board meeting followed an avalanche of accusations against the producer by more than two dozen women, including actresses Angelina Jolie, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Rose McGowan, who alleges that he raped her in a hotel room. Police forces in the US and the UK are investigating the allegations. Weinstein, 65, has apologised for some aspects of his behaviour but insisted that any sexual contacts he had were consensual, and he denies accusations of criminal sexual harassment, rape and sexual assault. This video can not be played On some red carpets, Harvey Weinstein is not a welcome subject The expulsion comes after Bob Weinstein told the Hollywood Reporter that his ""sick and depraved"" brother should be ""kicked out"" of the Academy. Filmmaker Woody Allen told the BBC the scandal was ""very sad for everybody involved"". ""Tragic for all women involved and sad for Harvey. The whole situation is very sad. There are no winners in that,"" he said in New York. Weinstein's expulsion means he will no longer be able to vote for nominees or winners in the Oscars. Hollywood figures were quick to praise the move but some have called for the Academy to take similar action against other members. By the BBC's Laura Bicker in Los Angeles The Academy is trying to send a message that the casting couch culture that has been talked about in this industry for so long is over. This is a key moment for an industry which stands accused of developing a culture that makes women feel that exploitation is a price to pay to get a job. But in voting to expel Harvey Weinstein, the Academy has a problem. If Weinstein is indeed the tip of the iceberg, as many industry insiders have said, what do they do about other members who have been accused of sexual assault, such as Bill Cosby and Roman Polanski? As many people who have spoken to me here have said, the Academy condemnation cannot stop here. Shakespeare in Love won Best Picture at the 1999 Oscars It is only the second time a member has been expelled. Actor Carmine Caridi had hismembership revoked,externalin 2004 after he allegedly sent confidential film preview videos to a friend which ended up online. As the co-founder of Miramax Pictures and the Weinstein Company, Harvey Weinstein produced some of cinema's most celebrated films, including Pulp Fiction, The English Patient, and Shakespeare in Love. He has been thanked dozens of times in Oscar acceptance speeches, and in 2012 the actress Meryl Streep jokingly referred to him as ""God"" onstage. Amol Rajan: The horror of Weinstein's casting couch A history of Hollywood sex scandals Matt Damon denies 'killing' 2004 Weinstein story But as accusations against Weinstein began to mount in recent days, film industry heavyweights came out to publicly condemn him and the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (Bafta) suspended his membership. The French government is reportedly considering revoking his Legion of Honour, France's highest civilian distinction, and there have been calls from some British politicians for his honorary CBE title to be revoked. 'Sick and depraved' Speaking to the Hollywood Reporter,external, Bob Weinstein called his brother ""sick and depraved"" and said he had no idea of ""the type of predator that he was"". He refused to comment on reports that he and the board of Weinstein Company were aware of Weinstein's settlements with women during recent contract negotiations, saying only that the board ""did not know the extent of my brother's actions"". He went on to call his brother's apology statement ""utter insanity"" and a ""lame excuse"". ""I'll tell you what I did know,"" he said. ""Harvey was a bully, Harvey was arrogant...that I knew"". Earlier, Bob Weinstein denied media reports that the Weinstein Company - which has placed Harvey Weinstein on indefinite leave - could now be closed or sold. But several large film projects have been pulled from the company already, and reports in the Los Angeles Times and Wall Street Journal said that financers had begun to pressure the board to sell.

"This video can not be played First commercial flight touches down at ""the world's most useless airport"" The first scheduled commercial airline service to the remote British island of St Helena in the south Atlantic has touched down safely. The virgin flight, an SA Airlink service from South Africa, ends the island's long-standing reliance on a ship which sailed every three weeks. It is hoped that the service, funded by the UK, will boost tourism and help make St Helena more self-sufficient. But British media have dubbed it ""the most useless airport in the world"". The opening of the airport was delayed by problems with wind Built with Â£285m ($380m) of funding from the UK Department for International Development (Dfid), the airport should have opened in 2016, but dangerous wind conditions delayed the launch. After further trials this summer, the weekly service between Johannesburg and St Helena was passed as safe. As seen from inside the cabin, the first ever commercial flight lands at St Helena Airport St Helena had for decades been one of the world's most inaccessible locations, served only by a rare ship service from South Africa. It is chiefly known as the island to which French Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte was exiled after his defeat in the Battle of Waterloo in 1815, and where he died. The Embraer E190-100IGW aircraft took off from Johannesburg on Saturday morning, carrying 78 passengers. It reached St Helena in the afternoon after stopping in the Namibian capital, Windhoek. ""I for one am getting really excited about the new chapter in St Helena's history,"" said St Helena governor Lisa Phillips. Population4,255 Area122 sq km (47 sq miles) Major languageEnglish Major religionChristianity CurrencySt Helena Pound (equal to British pound) EconomyAgriculture, fishing concessions and tourism Previously travel to and from the tiny island, with its population of just 4,255, was only possible on the RMS St Helena, which took around six days to complete the journey from South Africa. The ship's final voyage is scheduled for February. This video can not be played The first commercial flight makes a wobbly landing St Helena relies on British aid of Â£52m a year and officials hope increased tourism will make it more self-sufficient. ""This is an important moment in St Helena's route to self-sufficiency,"" a Dfid spokeswoman said. ""It will boost its tourism industry, creating the opportunity to increase its revenues, and will bring other benefits such as quicker access to healthcare for those living on the island.""

"The Harry Potter train made an unscheduled stop close to the bothy A family stranded in the Scottish Highlands have been rescued by the ""Hogwarts Express"" steam train. Jon and Helen Cluett and their four young children were staying at a remote bothy in Lochaber when their canoe was swept away by a swollen river. Facing a long walk back to their car across boggy land, they phoned the police for advice. To their delight, they arranged for the steam train used in the Harry Potter films to pick them up. The train, called The Jacobite, is used for excursions on the West Highland Railway Line, crossing the iconic Glenfinnan Viaduct that also features in the movies. The Jacobite crosses the Glenfinnan Viaduct, made famous by the Harry Potter films The Cluetts and their children - aged six, eight, 10 and 12 - were enjoying a half-term break at the Essan bothy, on the south shore of Loch Eilt. ""You can get to it by quite an arduous walk in - or you can paddle for 10 minutes in a canoe across the loch from the road. We had a canoe so we paddled across the loch to the bothy,"" explained Mr Cluett. ""We were all in the bothy, warm and fed - all was good - but we'd moored the boat in a little burn behind the bothy, tied it to a wall, pulled high out of the water. My daughter woke up yesterday and says 'Daddy, Daddy - the stream is massive'. ""The burn was overflowing. The entire area was underwater. The rocks I'd tied the boat to were pulled apart and the boat was gone."" The bothy, in the distance, is easily accessible by canoe but less so on foot The family weighed up their options for getting back to their car. A three-mile walk with small children across difficult boggy ground or along the nearby railway line were discounted as impractical or too dangerous. ""In the end I decided the only option was to phone the police and mountain rescue, ask if they have any local knowledge that could help us out,"" said Mr Cluett. The police came back with a magical solution. They arranged for the next train on the railway line that runs close to the bothy to make an unscheduled stop. ""The amazing thing was it wasn't just any train. The next train that was passing was the Jacobite steam train - the Harry Potter, Hogwarts Express steam train that goes up and down that line."" The family hurriedly packed up their belongings and made their way to the line, about 400 metres way. ""We threw all our stuff into some bags and boxes and ran out of the door of the bothy at the same time as the train is coming around the tracks,' said Mr Cluett. ""The train is getting closer,  we're running down, stuff bouncing everywhere, big smiles on the kids faces. It all started to be fun at that point. ""I'm slightly sad because I'd lost my boat - but the kids, when they saw the steam train coming, all sadness left their little faces and was replaced by excitement and fun - just the real joy of having an adventure and having the train stop right next to them."" The adventure turned out more magical than anyone expected The family were dropped off at the next stop, at Lochailort, from where Mr Cluett was able to hitch a lift to retrieve his car. He reflected: ""The kids have certainly had an adventure. We've all had an adventure - a big thanks to everyone who helped us."" His only regret is that his canoe has still not turned up - although he remains hopeful someone will find it. ""I think it will still be bobbing around in the loch somewhere. A big red canoe - so if you see it, that would be helpful. That would make the last part of the story even better.""

"Roger Stotesbury was on a ""middle-aged gap year"" with his wife Hilary and they were due to return home this month A British man has fallen to his death while taking photos at a temple in India during a year-long world trip. Roger Stotesbury, 56, was visiting Orchha, in the Indian state of Madhya Pradesh, with his wife Hilary on Friday when he plummeted 30ft (9m) from the Laxmi Narayan temple. The couple, from Oxford, were blogging about their ""middle-aged gap year"". The Foreign Office said it was providing assistance to the family of a British man following his death. Mr Stotesbury's family said the father of two had just finished taking shots of the scenery from the 17th Century temple, about 160 miles south of the Taj Mahal.

Mr Stotesbury was taking photos on first floor of the Laxmi Narayan temple when he fell 30ft A family spokesman said: ""They were the most happily married couple I have ever known. They were just so devoted to each other. ""Roger took lots and lots of photographs, and he had gone to take some views from the temple. ""He put his equipment down and then he fell."" Ontheir blog,external, Mr Stotesbury wrote that his motto was to ""die young as late as possible"". The couple also wrote: ""We took the view that on your deathbed you never wish you'd spent more time in the office. ""We've seen our two kids off into the wider world and we have no more caring responsibilities for our parents. ""So we thought now is the time to take a gap year and travel whilst we still have the health and energy. After all you only live once."" In a statement issued on their behalf by the Foreign Office, his family said: ""Roger Stotesbury was one of the most enthusiastic men who walked the planet, and was incredibly loved by his wife, children and the surrounding community. ""He brightened every room he entered. He and his wife, Hilary had planned their round-the-world gap year since the beginning of 2016 and set off on 1 November last year. ""They loved the last 11-and-a-half months of energetic travel, exploring from the bottom tip of Patagonia, right up through the Americas, to Canada, Australia, China, Japan, Korea, Indonesia, Malaysia and finally India.""

"The couple have been engaged since 2013 England cricketer Ben Stokes has married Clare Ratcliffe at a ceremony in East Brent, near Weston-super-Mare. International team-mates Joe Root, Stuart Broad and Alastair Cook were among the guests at the church service. Stokes, 26, was arrested last month on suspicion of causing actual bodily harm following an incident outside a nightclub in Bristol.

Dr Sara Lear is the proud owner of a ""box bike"" which was designed in the Netherlands in the late 1990s for ferrying children around.

It is a descendant of the cargo bike, which has an illustrious history as the delivery vehicle of choice for butchers and bakers for more than a century. Collectively known as ""bakfietsen"" - Dutch for box bikes - there are now a variety of versions on the market costing Â£1,500 or more. The twist with the modern-day box bike is that children have become the cargo. Maartin van Andel said he made the first wooden box bike for children in 1999 Nobody knows exactly how many cargo bikes are out there. The reason for this is that most are built by boutique makers and largely sold by independent bike shops rather than large chains. Independent market researchers Mintel said the cargo bike share of the Â£1bn annual UK bike industry was not yet large enough to claim a bar on a chart. Steve Garidis, operations director at the Bicycle Association, said although it is known that 95% of all bikes on sale are imported, the breakdown of what types of bikes are being brought in is hard to pinpoint. He said getting better data was something the association was ""trying to tackle"". Exact numbers aside, what is clear is that Cambridge is home to a cargo bike boom. The ground level of the city's railway station cycle park is given over entirely to cargo bikes. And the original box bike company, Bakfiets, said it had sold more of its box bikes in the university city - more than 500 to date - than in any other place of its size outside its native Netherlands. The idea of marrying a wooden box with a standard push bike for the school run came from an unlikely source - an expert in prosthetics. Maartin van Andel, who lives in Amsterdam, wanted a means of taking his children to school without having to drive his car. The answer was the box bike. He said he made the first wooden one specifically for children in 1999. The wooden box bike has become a familiar sight on the streets of Cambridge ""I just wanted to make my own life easier,"" he remembers. ""I had no intention to make something commercial. It was convenient - and it was easy and cheap to make it using wood."" He said he never imagined breaking into the lucrative Â£850m Dutch bicycle industry, in whichone million bikes were sold in 2016,external. ""I took the design around but no-one was interested in it at first, so I was obliged to start my own business. ""When other parents said they wanted one too, I ended up making 10 myself. It took off from there."" Hugh Salt, a friend of the inventor, later brought the unusual cycle to Cambridge. Mr Van Andel describes him as ""my first British dealer"". Hugh Salt says similarities with Holland make Cambridge ideal for a cycling revolution Mr Salt now runs a business selling and servicing the bikes in the city's Hope Yard. He says the rise in popularity of box bikes is down to the cosmopolitan population built around the university and a flat landscape. ""The science park, the university colleges, the hospital - they're all accessible by bike,"" he says. ""You can be very time efficient down to the last minute."" The ground level of Cambridge station's cycle park is given over to cargo bikes Parents say the school run has a little more magic when it involves a cargo bike The city currently has about 80 miles of cycle paths and wider cycle lanes are emerging in many of its commuter routes. Roxanne De Beaux, of Camcycle, said the city's infrastructure needed improvement to encourage more people to cycle. ""While cycling is very safe it's the perception of danger that people base their decisions on - and sharing space with fast-moving traffic is not pleasant even for experienced cyclists,"" she said. ""What we need are more protected cycle [routes] with adequate width for these kinds of bikes and for people to cycle alongside each other, especially parents and children."" One of the original sketches Maarten van Andel made in the design of his wooden cargo bike The wooden box is made of bonded plywood attached to a steel frame Two-seaters weigh in at 40kg (6st) They are made at the Azor bicycle factory in Hoogeveen, about 100 miles (160km) from Amsterdam Dr Emily Dourish uses a cargo bike to ferry Eleanor, aged six, almost two miles each day to school. Her other daughter Sarah, eight, now cycles separately. ""The best thing is being able to chuck all your stuff in, swimming bags, violins and so on and knowing that they'll stay dry if it rains. ""Now that we have it, I am a complete evangelist. And it keeps me fit. ""It can be a bit scary on windy days - with just two wheels it feels like we get buffeted around sometimes."" Emily Dourish, left, and Sara Lear, right, have become evangelists for the box bike The question of box bike safety has left some flummoxed. In 2013, for example, a father on a cargo bike in Londonmade national news,externalafter he was pulled over by a police officer wanting to know if it was legal. The Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents said it did not yet have enough information about the safety of cargo bikes to offer a view on them but would keep a watchful eye on their growing use in case any issues emerge. Although a European safety standard exists for bicycles, there is not one yet written for cargo or box bikes. In August, theEuropean Standardization Committee,externalbegan looking at whether a new standard for cargo bikes was needed. The British Standards Institute said it would be involved in the process. If a new standard was needed, the institute said, it might not be completed until 2020. Sam Jones, of Cycling UK, said the child-carrying bikes provided a viable and safe alternative to the car. ""The long wheel base and low centre of gravity of most cargo bikes also makes them more stable - and therefore easier to ride and safer."" Although the city is awash with them, Cambridge is not the only place to witness the rise of the cargo bike. In London, various cycle hire companies offer cargo bikes. In Manchester, university staff can getfree use of a cargo bike,externalas part of an EU-funded scheme. Waltham Forest Borough Council has also got in on the action,beginning a year-long trial,externalthis month offering various types of cargo bikes on free short-term loans. The box bikes come in all shapes and sizes, with larger versions and brands holding four children at a time But whether the cargo bike is a fad or here to stay remains to be seen. ""When the children were small they loved chatting and singing songs at each other and me, and waving at people like the Queen,"" Dr Dourish said. ""It's mainly tourists who point and take photos. The novelty has worn off for most Cambridge people."" Photography: Laurence Cawley and Orla Moore Why do so many Dutch people cycle? City where a third of travel is on a bike.

"This video can not be played Joshua Boyle said he hoped his family could rebuild a normal life A Canadian held hostage by the Taliban has spoken of the group's ""stupidity and evil"", revealing they murdered his daughter and raped his wife. Joshua Boyle spoke to reporters after landing in Canada with his wife Caitlan Coleman and children following almost five years in captivity. They were captured while reportedly backpacking in Afghanistan in 2012. Ms Coleman's father has said the decision to visit the dangerous country was ""unconscionable"". Who are the Taliban? Both sets of parents have previously questioned why the couple were in Afghanistan in the first place. ""What I can say is taking your pregnant wife to a very dangerous place is to me and the kind of person I am, is unconscionable,"" Jim Colemantold ABC News,externalfollowing their rescue on Wednesday. ""I can't imagine doing that myself. But, I think that's all I want to say about that."" However, Mr Boyle told reporters at Toronto's Pearson International Airport the couple had been trying to deliver aid to villagers in a part of the Taliban-controlled region ""where no NGO, no aid worker, and no government"" had been able to reach when they were kidnapped. This video can not be played ""It was amazing"" - Boyle's parents relive the moment they heard of his release Ms Coleman was heavily pregnant at the time with their first child. This week, they returned with three children, all born in captivity, the youngest of whom is understood to be in poor health. In his statement, Mr Boyle appeared to suggest they had had a fourth child, a baby girl who had been killed by their captors, the Taliban-aligned Haqqani network, as he also revealed they had raped his wife. It was, he said, ""retaliation for my repeated refusal"" to accept an offer made to him by the network. ""The stupidity and the evil of the Haqqani network in the kidnapping of a pilgrim... was eclipsed only by the stupidity and evil of authorising the murder of my infant daughter,"" he said. ""And the stupidity and evil of the subsequent rape of my wife, not as a lone action by one guard, but assisted by the captain of the guard and supervised by the commandant."" The family were finally rescued by the Pakistani army after a US tip-off during an operation near the Afghan border. This video can not be played File video of Joshua Boyle and his wife Caitlan Coleman while in captivity Initial reports suggested Mr Boyle had refused to board a US military flight out of Pakistan. Mr Boyle was once married to a woman who espoused radical Islamist views and is the sister of aformer Guantanamo Bay inmate, Omar Khadr. CNN suggested he might fear prosecution by the US authorities. But Mr Boyle rubbished the reports after arriving in Canada.

"Roger Stotesbury was on a ""middle-aged gap year"" with his wife Hilary and they were due to return home this month A British man has fallen to his death while taking photos at a temple in India during a year-long world trip. Roger Stotesbury, 56, was visiting Orchha, in the Indian state of Madhya Pradesh, with his wife Hilary on Friday when he plummeted 30ft (9m) from the Laxmi Narayan temple. The couple, from Oxford, were blogging about their ""middle-aged gap year"". The Foreign Office said it was providing assistance to the family of a British man following his death. Mr Stotesbury's family said the father of two had just finished taking shots of the scenery from the 17th Century temple, about 160 miles south of the Taj Mahal. The couple had been due to return to the UK this month, after completing their India trip. Mr Stotesbury was taking photos on first floor of the Laxmi Narayan temple when he fell 30ft A family spokesman said: ""They were the most happily married couple I have ever known. They were just so devoted to each other. ""Roger took lots and lots of photographs, and he had gone to take some views from the temple. ""He put his equipment down and then he fell."" Ontheir blog,external, Mr Stotesbury wrote that his motto was to ""die young as late as possible"". The couple also wrote: ""We took the view that on your deathbed you never wish you'd spent more time in the office. ""We've seen our two kids off into the wider world and we have no more caring responsibilities for our parents. ""So we thought now is the time to take a gap year and travel whilst we still have the health and energy. After all you only live once."" In a statement issued on their behalf by the Foreign Office, his family said: ""Roger Stotesbury was one of the most enthusiastic men who walked the planet, and was incredibly loved by his wife, children and the surrounding community. ""He brightened every room he entered. He and his wife, Hilary had planned their round-the-world gap year since the beginning of 2016 and set off on 1 November last year. ""They loved the last 11-and-a-half months of energetic travel, exploring from the bottom tip of Patagonia, right up through the Americas, to Canada, Australia, China, Japan, Korea, Indonesia, Malaysia and finally India.""

"Riders were trapped 70ft up in the air after the Power Tower ride malfunctioned More than 30 people were trapped in mid-air for five hours when a fairground ride broke down. A fault with the Power Tower ride at Hull Fair on Friday left the riders, aged between nine and 60, stranded about 70ft (21m) in the air. Firefighters used an aerial platform to rescue those stuck on the ride. The organisers of Hull Fair have apologised, saying a computer malfunction had caused the automatic brakes to activate. Hull City Council said the ride would remain closed on Saturday to allow the owners to conduct ""thorough and rigorous tests to find the cause of the computer system failure"". Firefighters used an aerial platform to rescue those stuck on the ride Incident commander for Humberside Fire and Rescue Service, Phil Leake, said the ride became stuck at about 19:00 BST and the last riders were taken off at about 01:00. ""We used our aerial platform - it's like a very large cherry picker,"" he said. ""We had to position that at certain points around the ride and then start to gradually take people off."" Riders were given drinks and blankets as the fire service worked to remove them from the ride. Mr Leake paid tribute to those trapped, saying: ""I would like to pass on my thanks to the members of the public that were on that ride. ""They were extremely patient and calm through the whole very long timescale of the incident."" A spokesperson for Hull Fair said: ""We can only apologise for inconvenience caused. ""Unfortunately rides, whether they are located in a theme park or fairground, can break down."" Hull City Council said: ""We apologise for any inconvenience caused by this closure, however the safety of visitors to Hull Fair is a top priority for both the council and fairground operators.""

"Weinstein has already been suspended by Bafta in the UK The organisation behind the Oscars has voted to expel Harvey Weinstein following numerous allegations of sexual assault made against the film producer. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences said its board ""voted well in excess of the required two-thirds majority"" to expel him. Its members include Hollywood figures such as Tom Hanks and Whoopi Goldberg. Weinstein's films have received more than 300 Oscar nominations and won 81. In a statement, the Academy said governors voted to expel Weinstein ""not simply to separate ourselves from someone who does not merit the respect of his colleagues but also to send a message that the era of wilful ignorance and shameful complicity in sexually predatory behaviour and workplace harassment in our industry is over"". They added: ""What's at issue here is a deeply troubling problem that has no place in our society."" Exploring the casting couch culture of LA Harvey Weinstein: The accusers' stories Women in his own words The emergency board meeting followed an avalanche of accusations against the producer by more than two dozen women, including actresses Angelina Jolie, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Rose McGowan, who alleges that he raped her in a hotel room. Police forces in the US and the UK are investigating the allegations. Weinstein, 65, has apologised for some aspects of his behaviour but insisted that any sexual contacts he had were consensual, and he denies accusations of criminal sexual harassment, rape and sexual assault. This video can not be played On some red carpets, Harvey Weinstein is not a welcome subject The expulsion comes after Bob Weinstein told the Hollywood Reporter that his ""sick and depraved"" brother should be ""kicked out"" of the Academy. Filmmaker Woody Allen told the BBC the scandal was ""very sad for everybody involved"". ""Tragic for all women involved and sad for Harvey. The whole situation is very sad. There are no winners in that,"" he said in New York. Weinstein's expulsion means he will no longer be able to vote for nominees or winners in the Oscars. Hollywood figures were quick to praise the move but some have called for the Academy to take similar action against other members. By the BBC's Laura Bicker in Los Angeles The Academy is trying to send a message that the casting couch culture that has been talked about in this industry for so long is over. This is a key moment for an industry which stands accused of developing a culture that makes women feel that exploitation is a price to pay to get a job. But in voting to expel Harvey Weinstein, the Academy has a problem. If Weinstein is indeed the tip of the iceberg, as many industry insiders have said, what do they do about other members who have been accused of sexual assault, such as Bill Cosby and Roman Polanski? As many people who have spoken to me here have said, the Academy condemnation cannot stop here. Shakespeare in Love won Best Picture at the 1999 Oscars It is only the second time a member has been expelled. Actor Carmine Caridi had hismembership revoked,externalin 2004 after he allegedly sent confidential film preview videos to a friend which ended up online. As the co-founder of Miramax Pictures and the Weinstein Company, Harvey Weinstein produced some of cinema's most celebrated films, including Pulp Fiction, The English Patient, and Shakespeare in Love. He has been thanked dozens of times in Oscar acceptance speeches, and in 2012 the actress Meryl Streep jokingly referred to him as ""God"" onstage. Amol Rajan: The horror of Weinstein's casting couch A history of Hollywood sex scandals Matt Damon denies 'killing' 2004 Weinstein story But as accusations against Weinstein began to mount in recent days, film industry heavyweights came out to publicly condemn him and the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (Bafta) suspended his membership. The French government is reportedly considering revoking his Legion of Honour, France's highest civilian distinction, and there have been calls from some British politicians for his honorary CBE title to be revoked. 'Sick and depraved' Speaking to the Hollywood Reporter,external, Bob Weinstein called his brother ""sick and depraved"" and said he had no idea of ""the type of predator that he was"". He refused to comment on reports that he and the board of Weinstein Company were aware of Weinstein's settlements with women during recent contract negotiations, saying only that the board ""did not know the extent of my brother's actions"". He went on to call his brother's apology statement ""utter insanity"" and a ""lame excuse"". ""I'll tell you what I did know,"" he said. ""Harvey was a bully, Harvey was arrogant...that I knew"". Earlier, Bob Weinstein denied media reports that the Weinstein Company - which has placed Harvey Weinstein on indefinite leave - could now be closed or sold. But several large film projects have been pulled from the company already, and reports in the Los Angeles Times and Wall Street Journal said that financers had begun to pressure the board to sell.

"This video can not be played First commercial flight touches down at ""the world's most useless airport"" The first scheduled commercial airline service to the remote British island of St Helena in the south Atlantic has touched down safely. The virgin flight, an SA Airlink service from South Africa, ends the island's long-standing reliance on a ship which sailed every three weeks. It is hoped that the service, funded by the UK, will boost tourism and help make St Helena more self-sufficient. But British media have dubbed it ""the most useless airport in the world"". The opening of the airport was delayed by problems with wind Built with Â£285m ($380m) of funding from the UK Department for International Development (Dfid), the airport should have opened in 2016, but dangerous wind conditions delayed the launch. After further trials this summer, the weekly service between Johannesburg and St Helena was passed as safe. As seen from inside the cabin, the first ever commercial flight lands at St Helena Airport St Helena had for decades been one of the world's most inaccessible locations, served only by a rare ship service from South Africa. It is chiefly known as the island to which French Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte was exiled after his defeat in the Battle of Waterloo in 1815, and where he died. The Embraer E190-100IGW aircraft took off from Johannesburg on Saturday morning, carrying 78 passengers. It reached St Helena in the afternoon after stopping in the Namibian capital, Windhoek. ""I for one am getting really excited about the new chapter in St Helena's history,"" said St Helena governor Lisa Phillips.

"This video can not be played Adele Bellis says the consequences of the attack are ""always going to be with me."" People caught twice carrying acid in public should receive a mandatory six-month prison sentence, the Home Office has proposed. It is aimed at curbing the number of acid attacks committed, whichhas more than doubled in five years. Home Secretary Amber Rudd said she intended toban the sales of corrosive substances to under-18s. SurvivorAdele Bellistold BBC Radio 5 live that those who carry out acid attacks should face a life sentence. Between November 2016 and April 2017 there were 408 attacks, of which about 21% were committed by under-18s. Speaking to the BBC News Channel, actor and youth campaigner Theo Johnson said there needed to be more education about the consequences of carrying out acid attacks. ""People don't look for the future, so they'll do something today and not think about the lifetime effects of it happening."" Ms Rudd said the government was sending a message that ""the cowards who use these [acids] as weapons will not escape the full force of the law"". The new legislation would make it an offence to possess a corrosive substance in public. An individual caught with the substance would have to prove they had good reason for possessing it. If a person is caught twice with acid, they would serve a minimum six-month sentence if over the age of 18. Acid attacks: What has led to the rise and how can they be stopped? Hell in a bottle: I survived an acid attack Man admits injuring two in birthday acid attack Sale of acids to under-18s to be banned At this year's Conservative Party conference, the home secretary announced plans to ban sales of the substance to under-18s, saying that acid attacks were ""absolutely revolting"". Recent years have seen a number of high-profile acid attacks across the UK. Adele Bellis was waiting for a bus to work on 14 August 2014 when her life was changed forever. A man paid Â£500 by the then 22-year-old beautician's abusive ex-boyfriend, Anthony Riley, hurled sulphuric acid at her from a sports drink bottle as she stood at the bus stop. The corrosive substance destroyed her right ear and scarred the right side of her head and neck, her arm and chest. The government's plan would see those caught simply carrying a corrosive substances face a mandatory six-month term for a second offence. But acid attacks are usually charged as grievous bodily harm (GBH), which can carry a life sentence. Riley was later jailed for life, with a minimum term of 13 years, after being convicted of conspiracy to commit GBH. Jason Harrison, then 28, who admitted carrying out the attack in Lowestoft, Suffolk, was sentenced to four years for the same crime. Ms Bellis told BBC Radio 5 live the government's plan was ""a start"" but there was currently ""no consistency"" in sentences for those carrying out attacks. She said: ""It's going to get worse if nothing gets done. How many acid attacks does it need for something to be done about it? ""There is no consistency in the acid attack sentences. I think that acid attacks should have a separate law. At the minute you just get done for GBH. ""There should be a separate acid attack charge and I believe there should be a life sentence in there, whether you chuck it or you conspired in it. ""We are scarred for life."" Home Office minister Sarah Newton toldBBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""We treat it as seriously as we treat knives. ""So we are introducing this possession offence with a similar regime to that of knives so that if you are caught a second time in possession you have a mandatory sentence."" Detective Superintendent Matt West, the Metropolitan Police's lead on corrosive-based crime, told the programme that 20% of crimes involving acids were robberies. John Biggs, elected Labour mayor of the London borough of Tower Hamlets, said there was a ""massive fear"" of acid attacks. He told BBC Radio 5 live he wanted more to be done, including looking at reintroducing a registration system for sellers of harmful substances. This video can not be played What should you do in case of a chemical burn? Sales could also be restricted to people using credit or debit cards, so their identity is known, Mr Biggs added. Asked whether the proposals risked increasing controversial ""stop and search"" tactics by police, he said: ""Stop and search is a complicated issue and of course there has been a backlash of people feeling it's a way of labelling and targeting particular communities. ""But when I talk to the parents of people who have been injured, from whatever cause, they want bad people to be stopped. ""So it is an area where we know there is a gang problem, I think there is a wider social acceptance that we should be scrutinising people's behaviour."" In 2014 Andreas Christopheros, from Truro in Cornwall, wasattacked at his front door with sulphuric acidin a case of mistaken identity. He was left with permanent facial scarring and he remains blind in one eye. David Phillips, 49, from Hastings, Sussex, admitted assault causing grievous bodily harm with intent. Andreas Christopheros was a victim of mistaken identity Mr Christopheros said: ""[The acid attack] impacted every aspect of my life. ""From the moment I've woken up, every morning it takes me about half an hour to regain my sight. ""I've lost my eyelids three times now from the contractions of the scars."" The proposed legislation on acid would mirror the 'two strikes' rule which makes knife possession an offence. The Home Office is also considering criminal proceedings against online retailers who deliver knives to a buyer's home. It is hoped the measure would curb the sale of blades to children or teenagers.

"This video can not be played Hurricane Ophelia upgrades to category 3 The UK is set to experience the tail end of a category three hurricane with high temperatures and wind forecast. As a result of Hurricane Ophelia, parts of England could see temperatures reach 25C on Sunday beating the 15C average for mid-October. On Monday some areas of the UK will be hit with winds of up to 80mph (128km/h). The hurricane will be a storm when it hits the UK, exactly 30 years after the Great Storm of 1987 killed 18 people. On its way from the Azores in the Atlantic Ocean, Hurricane Ophelia is currently blowing winds of 115mph (185km/h) setting the record for the most eastern category three hurricane in the Atlantic. Category three hurricanes are defined as having wind speeds of between 111mph (179km/h) and 129mph (208km/h) and can cause major damage to well-built homes. Though it is forecast to gradually weaken later on Sunday, the US National Hurricane Center said Ophelia would still be blowing hurricane-force winds as it approaches Ireland on Monday. The Republic of Ireland's Met Officehas issued a red warning for counties in Munster and Connacht, predicting that coastal areas will be hit by winds in excess of 80mph (130km/h) from 09:00 BST on Monday until Tuesday. The ferocity of the hurricane will dissipate before it reaches the UK, but Ophelia's remnants are forecast to bring high winds in coastal areas. Western England, Northern Ireland and parts of Scotland will be most affected by the storm winds. Weather presenter Michael Fish is remembered for dismissing reports that a hurricane would hit the south of England in October 1987. The storm is often remembered for BBC Weather presenter Michael Fish dismissing reports that ""there was a hurricane on the way"". Although he was right, storm winds of 100mph did batter the south of England, leaving a trail of destruction. Eighteen people died and 15 million trees were destroyed as a result of the high winds. It is thought that the storm caused Â£1bn in damage to property and infrastructure. The Met Office has issued severe weather alerts ahead of Ophelia and has warned there could be potential power cuts, disruption to road and rail networks, and damage to buildings as a result of Monday's stormy weather. But parts of England will benefit from the warm temperatures brought by the storm, with areas as far up as Nottingham expected to hit highs of 21C on Monday. Clouds in central and southern England are expected to break up to provide sunny spells over the course of the weekend. Some parts of the country have been enjoying a ""mini heatwave"" already. Ian Senior tweeted a screenshot of the temperature in Cambourne, Cambridgeshire, which was 17C on Saturday morning. Jennie, who lives in Leeds, also wrote on Twitter that she never thought she would be ""walk[ing] around bare legged wearing a skirt and short sleeved T-shirt"" in mid-October. But some parts of the country were still waiting for the temperatures to improve. Martin Cluderay, from Swaledale in the Yorkshire Dales, posted an overcast scene from the town titled: ""Welcome to the heatwave."" West Scotland and Northern Ireland are forecast to receive heavy rainfall on Sunday. BBC Weather has tweeted that Monday will bring ""contrasting fortunes"" - wild and windy in some western areas, warm and breezy in the east. Allow Twitter content?

"Kurdish Peshmerga fighters have been ordered to defend Kirkuk ""at any cost"" A deadline allegedly set by Iraq's central government for Kurdish fighters to withdraw from key sites in the disputed city of Kirkuk has passed. Kurdish security officials said the deadline had been set for early on Sunday but Iraqi authorities denied it. Some reports now suggest the deadline has been extended by 24 hours. Both sides have sent troops to Kirkuk and brief clashes have already erupted between Kurds and Shia militia backing the government. Peshmerga fighters say they are preparing to defend positions in the city against possible attack by Iraqi forces. Tensions have been on the rise since Kurds held a referendum on independence last month, which Iraq called illegal. Iraqi Kurds decisively back independence Independence: What is at stake? The Iraqi parliament asked Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi to send troops to Kirkuk and other disputed areas after the official referendum results - which overwhelmingly backed independence - were proclaimed. The referendum was held in three autonomous provinces of Iraqi Kurdistan, but also in nearby Kurdish-held areas including Kirkuk. The province, which bears the same name as the city, is thought to have a Kurdish majority, but Kirkuk has large Arab and Turkmen populations. On Saturday, there was a brief outbreak of fighting near Kirkuk, with each side blaming the other, reports the BBC's Orla Guerin in Iraq. Mr Abadi said last week he would accept disputed areas being governed by a ""joint administration"" and that he did not want an armed confrontation. On Thursday, the prime minister and the Iraqi military reiterated that they had no plans for a military operation in Kirkuk and were focused on recapturing the last IS foothold in Iraq near the border with Syria. But since then there has been a major build up of Iraqi forces around the city and Kurdish officials say the Peshmerga have been ordered to defend their positions ""at any cost"". The oil-rich Kirkuk province is claimed by both the Kurds and Baghdad, though the two sides were recently united in the fight against the Islamic State (IS) jihadist group. Kurdish Peshmerga forces took control of much of the province in 2014, when IS militants swept across northern Iraq and the army collapsed.

"While Marsha P Johnson may not be a household name, a fiery digital debate has started about who is ""allowed"" to bring her story to the screen. Johnson was a black transgender woman and outspoken advocate for transgender rights in the 1960s. Most famously, she was a key participant in the 1969 Stonewall riots in New York City. Many see those events, which broke out after a police raid at the Stonewall Inn, a prominent gay bar, as the start of the gay rights movement in the United States. Johnson's story is the subject of a new Netflix documentary by David France, an established filmmaker who's also gay and white. But France is not the only one who's been looking into the story. Reina Gossett, a black transgender filmmaker, claimed in anInstagram post,externalthat France's film used her research without permission. He has vehementlydenied these allegations,external. Gossett's post received thousands of likes and shares on social media, sparking a wider debate, with many arguing that France should not have made a film about Johnson - or at least that he should have backed Gossett's efforts to bring the story to light. Johnson is receiving a small flurry of attention right now, but in the early 1970s, some in the LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender) community tried to distance themselves from Johnson and other transgender and drag queen activists. In 1992, Johnson went missing and her body was found six days later in the Hudson River. Police at the time called it a suicide, a ruling which many in the community disputed - citing high levels of violence against transgender women. Gossett and France have approached telling Marsha P Johnson's largely forgotten history in very different ways. Gossett is working with filmmaker Sasha Wortzel on ""Happy Birthday Marsha"", a fictionalised short film on the hours leading up to the Stonewall riots. Whereas France's ""The Death and Life of Marsha P Johnson"" is a documentary following trans activist Victoria Cruz as she investigates the circumstances of Johnson's death. However, some on social media have argued France should have stepped aside and let Gossett, a member of the trans community, tell Johnson's story. Allow Twitter content?

Lourdes Hunter, founder of the Trans Women of Color Collective, a grassroots organisation based in Washington DC, described France's documentary as ""compelling,"" but felt that France should have used his position as an established filmmaker and a white man to promote the work of those in the black trans community. ""Stories about black trans women should be told by black trans women,"" she tells BBC Trending. Hunter added that France's proclaimed support of Gossett's film is not enough. ""People who have access to resources, have access to social capital, access to finances, their role in the movement is to leverage their access so that the people who are supposed to be telling these stories... who are actually living these lives, [their] voices can be elevated."" Listen to more on this story on BBC Trending radio Transgender train workers: 'Don't pity us' Why transgender Africans turned against a famous feminist Follow BBC Trending on Facebook,external France, however, said he felt creating this documentary was a way of atoning for some of his community's past mistakes. His production company gave money to Gossett and Wortzel, and he says he supported their project independently of his own film. ""For me to not go back, for me to not revisit that story about which I knew so much already, would align me with the people who were eliminating their narrative from our history,"" France says, adding that the stories of historically important figures belong to all of humanity. Gossett did not respond to BBC Trending's questions, but recently expanded on her initial post. ""As France's documentary starts to make its way to large audiences, I can't stop thinking about the voices that have been pushed aside in the process,"" she wrotein an article for Teen Vogue,external. ""Too often, people with resources who already have a platform become the ones to tell the stories of those at the margins rather than people who themselves belong to these communities."" The feminist site Jezebel hassince published a comprehensive rebuttal,externalto Gossett's initial allegations. France's documentary has received positive reviews from the mainstream media. According to Gossett, her film is still scheduled to premiere next year. But the online debate continues around who has the right to tell Marsha P Johnson's story.

"A hallucinogen found in magic mushrooms can ""reset"" the brains of people with untreatable depression, raising hopes of a future treatment, scans suggest. The small study gave 19 patients a single dose of the psychedelic ingredient psilocybin. Half of patients ceased to be depressed and experienced changes in their brain activity that lasted about five weeks. However, the team at Imperial College London says people should not self-medicate. There has been a series of small studies suggesting psilocybin could have a role in depression by acting as a""lubricant for the mind""that allows people to escape a cycle of depressive symptoms. But the precise impact it might be having on brain activity was not known. The team at Imperial performed fMRI brain scans before treatment with psilocybin and then the day after (when the patients were ""sober"" again). The study,published in the journal Scientific Reports,external, showed psilocybin affected two key areas of the brain. The amygdala - which is heavily involved in how we process emotions such as fear and anxiety - became less active. The greater the reduction, the greater the improvement in reported symptoms. The default-mode network - a collaboration of different brain regions - became more stable after taking psilocybin. Dr Robin Carhart-Harris, head of psychedelic research at Imperial, said the depressed brain was being ""clammed up"" and the psychedelic experience ""reset"" it. He told the BBC News website: ""Patients were very ready to use this analogy. Without any priming they would say, 'I've been reset, reborn, rebooted', and one patient said his brain had been defragged and cleaned up."" However, this remains a small study and had no ""control"" group of healthy people with whom to compare the brain scans. Further, larger studies are still needed before psilocybin could be accepted as a treatment for depression. However, there is no doubt new approaches to treatment are desperately needed. Depression: A revolution in treatment? Prof Mitul Mehta, from the Institute of Psychiatry at King's College London, said: ""What is impressive about these preliminary findings is that brain changes occurred in the networks we know are involved in depression, after just a single dose of psilocybin. ""This provides a clear rationale to now look at the longer-term mechanisms in controlled studies.""

"This video can not be played First commercial flight touches down at ""the world's most useless airport"" The first scheduled commercial airline service to the remote British island of St Helena in the south Atlantic has touched down safely. The virgin flight, an SA Airlink service from South Africa, ends the island's long-standing reliance on a ship which sailed every three weeks. It is hoped that the service, funded by the UK, will boost tourism and help make St Helena more self-sufficient. But British media have dubbed it ""the most useless airport in the world"". The opening of the airport was delayed by problems with wind Built with Â£285m ($380m) of funding from the UK Department for International Development (Dfid), the airport should have opened in 2016, but dangerous wind conditions delayed the launch. After further trials this summer, the weekly service between Johannesburg and St Helena was passed as safe. As seen from inside the cabin, the first ever commercial flight lands at St Helena Airport St Helena had for decades been one of the world's most inaccessible locations, served only by a rare ship service from South Africa. It is chiefly known as the island to which French Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte was exiled after his defeat in the Battle of Waterloo in 1815, and where he died. The Embraer E190-100IGW aircraft took off from Johannesburg on Saturday morning, carrying 78 passengers. It reached St Helena in the afternoon after stopping in the Namibian capital, Windhoek. ""I for one am getting really excited about the new chapter in St Helena's history,"" said St Helena governor Lisa Phillips.

"This video can not be played Hassan Rouhani: ""Iran will not surrender."" Global powers, including key US allies, have said they will stand by the Iran nuclear deal which US President Donald Trump has threatened to tear apart. Mr Trump said on Friday that he would stop signing off on the agreement. The UK, France and Germany responded that the pact was ""in our shared national security interest"". The EU said it was ""not up to any single country to terminate"" a ""working"" deal. Iran's President Hassan Rouhani said the US was ""more isolated than ever"". ""Can a president annul a multilateral international treaty on his own?"" he asked. ""Apparently he doesn't know that this agreement is not a bilateral agreement solely between Iran and the United States."" Trump's Iran deal speech: Full text Iran nuclear deal: Key details What tougher Iran strategy means The deal, signed in 2015, is between Iran and six international powers - the UK, the US, Russia, France, Germany, and China. It imposed curbs on Iran's nuclear programme in return for an easing of international sanctions. In a combative speech on Friday, Mr Trump called Iran a ""fanatical regime"" and said it had violated the terms of the deal. He accused Iran of sponsoring terrorism, and proposed new sanctions. ""We will not continue down a path whose predictable conclusion is more violence, more terror, and the very real threat of Iran's nuclear breakout,"" he said. This video can not be played Trump: 'I can terminate US involvement in deal any time' International observers say Iran has been in full compliance with the agreement. China has not spoken since Mr Trump's speech but previously called on the US to preserve the deal. Russia's foreign ministry said it regretted Mr Trump's decision but did not expect it to stop the deal being implemented. Congress requires the president to certify every 90 days that Iran is upholding its part of the agreement. Mr Trump had already recertified twice, but refused to sign a third time ahead of a Sunday deadline. Congress now has 60 days to decide whether to pull out of the nuclear deal by re-imposing sanctions. Trump hands Iran chalice to Congress Although some advocates of the deal had feared that Mr Trump would withdraw the US entirely, he has instead essentially referred the matter to Congress. Mr Trump is seeking the end to the nuclear deal's so-called""sunset clauses"", one of which allows for the lifting of restrictions on Iran's nuclear enrichment programme after 2025. He announced treasury department sanctions on Iran's elite Revolutionary Guards, which he called the ""corrupt personal terror force of Iran's leader"", and called for restrictions on Iran's ballistic missile programme, which is not covered by the deal. Last month,Iran said it had successfully tested a new medium-range missilewith a 2,000km (1,200-mile) range. The president said that congressional leaders were drafting amendments that would curb Iran's ballistic missile development and eliminate expiry dates on restrictions to the country's nuclear development.

Saudi Arabia also backed the US president's ""firm strategy"" By Lyse Doucet, chief international correspondent President Trump has recast the list of Middle East threats, with Iran replacing so-called Islamic State (IS) as Enemy Number One. That world view is shared by his strongest supporters in the region, including Israel and Gulf Arab leaders who have long seen Iran as their primary threat, and a rival with vast sway across the Middle East. They resented Washington's focus on the Iran deal during President's Obama administration. Like President Trump, they want to undo his legacy. The new approach imposes new sanctions but stops short of designating Iran's elite Revolutionary Guards as a terrorist group - a step Iran says would be tantamount to a declaration of war. The urgent question now is whether the new strategy will embolden Iran's hardliners including the Revolutionary Guards. Like US forces, they're involved in battles to defeat IS in Iraq and Syria, and may also see a new enemy.

"After years of being characterised as dull, it seems Philip Hammond is now in the firing line for being too outspoken. The chancellor's use of the word ""enemy"" to describe EU negotiators on Friday is roundly condemned by The Sun. ""The Chancellor should be focused on his pivotal budget next month,"" it says. ""Instead he's lurching around, barking randomly. He must shut his gob."" The Daily Mail calls itMr Hammond's ""Basil Fawlty moment"",external. According to The Times, some Tories are pressing the prime minister to sack both the chancellor and Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - a move that they say would reassert her authority, with honour satisfied on both Leave and Remain wings of the party. Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning,external ""Trump's stance on Iran finds few in accord,"" says a headline in the Daily Telegraph. The paper says he wasreprimanded by world leaders,externalfor refusing to certify the Iran nuclear deal, and was warned he could trigger war. That is echoed by the Israeli newspaper, Haaretz, which says Donald Trump is prepared to risk mayhem tosatisfy his ego and erase Obama's legacy,external. His ""Iran deal bombshell"" undermines American credibility and gives North Korea the perfect excuse to avoid deal-making, it says. One of Iran's biggest selling papers, Hamshahri, says Tehran has replied to Mr Trump's claim that the Revolutionary Guard is a terrorist group - by placing the US military on a list of groups that undermine international security and stability. The Guardian is among the papers to quote claims that Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has floated the idea ofstopping people from attending A&E departments,externalunless they have first consulted their GP or called NHS 111. An NHS England adviser, Dr Helen Thomas, is quoted as telling a conference that Mr Hunt suggested it to her and that the idea could be piloted - although NHS England denies the suggestion. Meanwhile, the i carries claims that some family doctors have been threatening toremove patients who ""check Dr Google"",externalbefore appointments. GPs are apparently becoming exasperated by the number of ""cyberchondriacs"" - people who cannot stop self-diagnosing online.

"Robots in the workplace should be owned and controlled by workers rather than bosses, Jeremy Corbyn will suggest. The Labour leader, who has previously warned of the risk to jobs of automation, will say new technology has led to ""a more rapacious and exploitative form of capitalism"". He will also suggest ""gig economy"" firms like Uber could be replaced by co-operatives. Drivers would collectively agree their own pay and conditions, he will say. 100 Women: Who's going to lose out from automation? World Bank chief warns about automation Will a robot take your job? Earlier this year, a study by accountancy firm PwC said robotics and artificial intelligence could affect almost a third of UK jobs by the 2030s, with ""more manual, routine jobs"" which ""can effectively be programmed"" the most at risk. The report also said automation could create more wealth and additional jobs elsewhere in the economy. Speaking to the Co-operative Party Conference in London on Saturday, Mr Corbyn will return to his warning made in Labour's conference about the possible impact on workers. Labour does not ""have all the answers"" but is ""thinking radically"" he will say, pointing to the party's Alternative Models of Ownership report, launched last month. To prevent ""the rise of the robots"" only benefitting ""a powerful and wealthy few"", the report suggests ""putting the ownership and control of the robots in the hands of those who work with them,"" he will say. ""The technology of the digital age should empower us both as workers and consumers, allowing us to co-operate on a scale in a way that wasn't possible in the past,"" he will add. ""And yet too often it has given rein to a more rapacious and exploitative form of capitalism."" Mr Corbyn will criticise the wages and conditions offered by the likes of cab-hailing app Uber and food delivery service Deliveroo. Such companies say their drivers and riders are self-employed and therefore can work when they want - and in return for that flexibility they do not get the same benefits as full-time staff. Mr Corbyn will say: ""Imagine an Uber run co-operatively by their drivers, collectively controlling their futures, agreeing their own pay and conditions, with profits shared or re-invested. ""The biggest obstacle to this is not technological, but a rigged economic system that favours wealth extractors not wealth creators.""

"This video can not be played Hassan Rouhani: ""Iran will not surrender."" Global powers, including key US allies, have said they will stand by the Iran nuclear deal which US President Donald Trump has threatened to tear apart. Mr Trump said on Friday that he would stop signing off on the agreement. The UK, France and Germany responded that the pact was ""in our shared national security interest"". The EU said it was ""not up to any single country to terminate"" a ""working"" deal. Iran's President Hassan Rouhani said the US was ""more isolated than ever"". ""Can a president annul a multilateral international treaty on his own?"" he asked. ""Apparently he doesn't know that this agreement is not a bilateral agreement solely between Iran and the United States."" Trump's Iran deal speech: Full text Iran nuclear deal: Key details What tougher Iran strategy means The deal, signed in 2015, is between Iran and six international powers - the UK, the US, Russia, France, Germany, and China. It imposed curbs on Iran's nuclear programme in return for an easing of international sanctions. In a combative speech on Friday, Mr Trump called Iran a ""fanatical regime"" and said it had violated the terms of the deal. He accused Iran of sponsoring terrorism, and proposed new sanctions. ""We will not continue down a path whose predictable conclusion is more violence, more terror, and the very real threat of Iran's nuclear breakout,"" he said. This video can not be played Trump: 'I can terminate US involvement in deal any time' International observers say Iran has been in full compliance with the agreement.

"Pinterest president Tim Kendall When you think of the giants of Silicon Valley, Pinterest may not immediately spring to mind. But with 200 million active users and a recent valuation of $12.3bn (Â£9bn), the platform that started out in 2012 as a quirky online scrapbook has quietly become a hot commodity for advertisers and investors alike. Perhaps that's why Pinterest president Tim Kendall chooses to keep his cool with a daily ice bath. And the BBC's Zoe Kleinman found out that's not his only unusual routine... Zoe Kleinman:Is it true that you have an ice bath every morning? Tim Kendall:I now have a freezer on my back deck that I put water into, and now I get into that because the bath with ice wasn't quite cold enough.  So, it continues to escalate. It's like people having coffee in the morning. It's a slightly more extreme version of that. Pinterest has 200 million users worldwide It gives me a lot of energy, wakes me up, resets my mind and my body. Our days are long and intense and I find that if I do it I feel better throughout the day. My children love it. They like to talk to me while I'm in it, they ask how much it hurts, they dip their fingers in and then shake and say ""Argh, it's so cold!"" They're pretty entertained by it but I don't know how long that's going to last. I do ask them every once in a while, ""Hey, do you want to get in?"" And they are very clear that they do not want to get in it. ZK: You are renowned for always wearing a T-shirt with the word ""Focus"" on it. You're wearing one today - what's that about? TK: It's a shirt that I've been wearing for almost five years.  It's not the same shirt but it says the same word on it. It started as a bet with a colleague of mine, seeing who could wear the shirt for longer. He and I kept wearing it and eventually I kept wearing it longer. The whole point is that we philosophically think that if you do fewer things, you can do those fewer things much better than if you are spread across too many things. It's important that we remind ourselves of that. Sometimes I'm not great at focusing but if I put this shirt on every day, in a small part it reminds me that I need to stay focused and remember to say ""No"" a lot, which I think most people - including myself - are not great at. ZK: You don't allow laptops or mobile phones in meetings. Isn't that unusual for a tech boss? TK: I don't stick to my own rules as much as I like to. I think that in my experience, if you're having a meeting there's probably important information - hopefully.  If it was set up thoughtfully, the right people are in it and the agenda is right, it should be content you should be paying attention to and if you're on your phone or on your laptop you are definitely not paying attention to it. I've been in meetings where I've been on my laptop and I've missed critical information that I needed to hear, so we try to make it somewhat informal but a bit of a rule that we try to to follow, so we're all engaged with each other. When you leave the meeting, get back on your laptop, get back on your phone. But when you're in the meeting, be in the meeting. Are photos the future of search?

"Gordon Strachan said genetics were to blame for Scotland's failure to beat Slovenia The claim:Gordon Strachan, the former manager of Scotland, said after the country's failure to qualify for the 2018 World Cup in Russia that his team lacked the height and strength to compete, saying that Scotland were the second-shortest team ""in the last campaign"". Reality Check verdict:In recent years, Scotland have been among the shortest teams in Europe, when measuring average height of the squad - but not the second-shortest. However, height in football doesn't necessarily lead to success. After failing to lead Scotland to victory in their must-win World Cup qualifier against Slovenia, where did ex-manager Gordon Strachan lay the blame? Scotland's opponents might not have been technically superior, but they had ""height and strength"" the Scots had been unable to combat, Strachan said. ""Genetically, we are behind,"" he said. ""In the last campaign we were the second-smallest, apart from Spain."" Strachan's comments sparked a debate in the football world about whether Scotland, or any football team, needed more height in their team to succeed. Reality Check looked at whether Strachan has a point. Little and large. Shaun Wright-Phillips and Peter Crouch training for England. Slovenia are one of the tallest teams in Europe. Scotland's starting XI in Ljubljana were, on average, more than 3cm (1in) smaller than their opponents. Strachan's team, featuring players with an average height of 180.1cm, are actually in the top 10 of the ""shortest"" teams in Europe this year, according to research by the International Centre for Sport Studies (CIES) football observatory. In fact, by the average measure, they are surpassed - or maybe undercut - by only Cyprus, Israel and Armenia, level with Spain. Based on research by the CIES, which excludes seven countries (none of whom qualified), only two of the 10 shortest teams - Spain and France - will qualify for Russia 2018. The height of footballers does not necessarily reflect the national trend. Dutch menare the tallest in world, but their football team is currently one of the shortest in Europe. Lionel Messi, in action here for Argentina against Ecuador, is 170cm (5ft 6in) tall. Seven out of the 10 tallest teams in 2017, excluding the World Cup hosts Russia, either qualified automatically - Serbia, Iceland, Belgium and Germany - or made the play-offs - Sweden, Greece and Denmark. So it's certainly true that in the run-up to the World Cup, some of the tallest teams in Europe were in form this year. But it's difficult to say whether these teams were successful because of their stature. Strachan also claimed that Scotland had been the second-shortest team in their previous qualifying campaign (for Euro 2016).  But they were in fact the sixth-shortest in 2015. The eventual winners of the tournament were Portugal, who were also one of the shortest teams, suggesting height was not necessarily a bar to success. Globally, the top 10 shortest teams in 2015 contained some of the most successful football nations, and four World Cup winners: Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Spain.

"Oasis star Liam Gallagher has topped the charts with his first ever solo album, As You Were. The record sold 103,000 copies in its opening week, more than the rest of the Top 10 combined. According to the Official Charts Company, it is the third fastest-selling album of 2017 behind Ed Sheeran's Ã· and Rag'n'Bone Man's Human. ""I want to thank everyone who bought it,"" said Gallagher. ""I want to thank everyone who helped make it."" Gallagher poses with his official number one award The singer is no stranger to the top of the charts, having scored eight number one albums with Oasis. The band's third album, Be Here Now, was a sales phenomenon, selling 696,000 copies in just three days - a record that still stands 20 years later. But Gallagher's subsequent band, Beady Eye, never managed to top the charts. In fact their second album, 2015's BE, has sold fewer copies to date (77,575) than As You Were sold in its first week. The solo album sees the singer working with a number of established writers, most notably Greg Kurstin, whose previous credits include Adele and Sia, and Iain Archer, who co-wrote James Bay's Hold Back The River. He's promoted the record with appearances on the Graham Norton Show, Later... With Jools Holland and the Glastonbury festival.

Other new entries in this week's album chart include rapper Giggs, whose new mixtape Wamp 2 Dem is a response to Americans who criticise UK rap. ""People wasn't really respecting England,"" the South Londoner told Beats One. ""Wamp 2 Dem was more showing where we're coming, [explaining that] we're the same as you."" Giggs wants to correct the misrepresentation of UK rap A-ha, Marilyn Manson, JP Cooper and comedian-turned-crooner Jason Manford also make debuts in this week's Top 10. The slew of new entries means that last week's number one, Shania Twain's Now, is immediately evicted from the Top 10, landing at number 11. In the singles chart, New York rapper Post Malone wins a second week at number one with his latest single Rockstar. The track fends off a challenge from Camila Cabello, whose Latin-tinged single Havana climbs a place to number two; while Dua Lipa's New Rules racks up its tenth week in the top five.
