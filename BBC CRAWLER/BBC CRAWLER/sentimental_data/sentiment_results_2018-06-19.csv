"This video can not be played Liam Fox tells Laura Kuenssberg rebels have not changed Brexit stance The government's Brexit bill has passed through Parliament after Theresa May saw off a revolt by Tory MPs. Peers accepted the amendment to the EU (Withdrawal) Bill sent to them from the House of Commons, meaning the bill now goes for Royal Assent, becoming law. Earlier, the government won the vote 319 to 303, after assurances were accepted by would-be rebels that MPs would have a meaningful say. The PM called it a ""crucial step"" in delivering a ""smooth"" Brexit. Mrs May said: ""Today's votes show people in the UK, and to the EU, that the elected representatives in this country are getting on with the job, and delivering on the will of the British people. ""Over the next few weeks we will publish more details of our proposed future relationship with the EU in a White Paper, and will bring the Trade and Customs Bills back to the House of Commons. ""But today has been an important step in delivering the Brexit people voted for, a Brexit that gives Britain a brighter future, a Britain in control of its money, laws, and borders."" Who really backed down over Brexit vote? Can Theresa May 'take back control'? Brexit: All you need to know Brexit: Your guide to EU jargon Before the Commons vote, Dominic Grieve, leader of the would-be rebels - who wanted to ensure MPs had the power to stop the UK leaving without a deal - said the ""sovereignty of Parliament"" had been acknowledged. Both sides have claimed victory with Stephen Hammond, a pro-EU MP who eventually sided with the government, suggesting ministers had agreed to give Parliament a ""real say"" on top of other concessions. But international trade secretary Liam Fox said nothing had really changed and the option of a no-deal Brexit had been left firmly on the table. ""There is no change to the fundamental issue here which is the government cannot be forced by Parliament to negotiate something which it does not want to do,"" he told the BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg. He said the government had ""to be able to hold out in our negotiations the prospect of no deal"" otherwise the EU would get the upper hand. On Wednesday evening, following the Commons vote, Leader of the Lords Baroness Evans of Bowes Park said the EU (Withdrawal) Bill had been ""debated at length"" and was very different as a result of amendments tabled by the Lords. ""I believe our role now is to accept their view as expressed in a vote a few hours ago,"" she said. Peers approved the government's proposal without a vote. The UK is due to leave the European Union on 29 March 2019 and negotiations have been taking place over the terms of its departure. By Laura Kuenssberg, BBC political editor The government was worried enough about losing today to budge, even if they only gave an inch. It might be a concession that only really parliamentary lawyers understand, but the PM had to move, again, despite not wanting to. And despite the fact that she did compromise even in a meaningless way (yes I can't believe that I did just write that sentence, but it is relevant), the vote was still relatively close, certainly not comfortable enough for the government to relax any time soon. What's also the case is that the Tory rebels, or potential rebels more like, weren't willing to take dramatic action in enough number to humiliate the PM. The vote result suggests that they have the hypothetical numbers, but their critics, and their internal opponents in the Tory party would question if they really have the guts. Read more from Laura The government has been at odds with the House of Lords in the long-running row over what happens if the UK cannot reach a deal with the EU, or if MPs reject whatever deal the government agrees with the EU. The Commons vote had been expected to be tight and the government eventually prevailed by a majority of 16. Six Tory MPs - Ken Clarke, Anna Soubry, Sarah Wollaston, Heidi Allen, Antoinette Sandbach and Phillip Lee - rebelled while four Labour MPs backed the government and six other Labour MPs abstained, as did Kelvin Hopkins, who sits as an independent after having the whip withdrawn. Ms Wollaston tweeted that she was disappointed with the outcome. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The Lords is expected to finally approve the EU Withdrawal Bill on Wednesday The debate centred on what happens in three Brexit scenarios: If MPs vote down the UK-EU Brexit deal If Theresa May announces before 21 January 2019 that no deal has been reached If 21 January passes with no deal being struck. Under these circumstances, the government has said, a minister will make a statement in Parliament, setting out the proposed next steps. MPs will then vote on this statement. According to the government, this vote should be ""on neutral terms"", with MPs simply noting what has been said. But an amendment backed by the House of Lords on Monday went further, saying MPs should have to ""approve"" the minister's statement. The Department for Exiting the European Union has now conceded that it will be up to Commons Speaker John Bercow to decide the matter at the time. The government statement that Mr Grieve has accepted Speaking in the Commons, Dominic Grieve said the issue of the meaningful vote was about giving ""assurances to the House and many, many people in the country who are worried about this process and how it will end"". If Parliament wished to ""speak with one voice"" and exert its influence in the face of a non-deal scenario, it ""has the power to do it"". Mr Grieve said he had insisted on a key paragraph in the government statement accepting ""it is open to MPs to table motions and debate matters of concern and that, as is the convention, parliamentary time will be provided for this"". Another potential rebel Nicky Morgan said she did not wish to see Mrs May ""destabilised or undermined"" ahead of next week's summit of EU leaders. But she warned of further battles to come over the UK's trade and customs arrangements with the EU and suggested relationships between MPs had been ""strained almost beyond belief"". Please upgrade your browser And Conservative MP Vicky Ford, another pro-European MP who stuck with the government, said the outcome was ""not a mandate for a no-deal Brexit"". She said MPs had secured a ""backstop"" which meant if Parliament rejected the deal it could trigger ""another set of negotiations"" between the UK and EU aimed at getting an agreement before the UK left.

"Police said the cause of the explosion appeared to be a battery short circuiting Five people were injured in an explosion at a Tube station. Witnesses described smelling ""burning rubber"" and seeing ""six-foot flames"" at the entrance to Southgate Underground station in Enfield. Police said the ""minor explosion"", at about 19:00 BST on Tuesday, was thought to have been caused by a battery. Paramedics treated five people at the scene and took two to hospital. Police said they were ""working to establish the full facts"". London Mayor Sadiq Khan said the explosion had been ""confirmed as non suspicious"" and thanked the emergency services ""for a swift and professional response"". James Ayton, 34, from Southgate, was on the ""packed"" escalator when he saw a ""quick burst"" of flames at the top. He said they were ""six foot plus"" and everyone ""legged it"" upon hearing a ""rapid whooshing sound"". ""The Tube had just unloaded. The escalator was full,"" he said. ""A few people on the escalator got trampled on. There was screaming. ""An old woman got trampled on. I had to carry a woman up the stairs. I think she was in shock to be honest. She couldn't walk, shaking."" Witnesses described smelling ""burning rubber"" at the entrance to the station He said he saw a Tube worker pick something up that was on fire and extinguish it but added: ""I think that was secondary rather than the cause."" Haluk Ozkan was about to get on a bus outside the station when he smelled something burning. The finance worker, 26, who was with his partner at the time, said: ""We were just outside the exit. We could smell a burning smell, like burning rubber."" ""We thought the bus engine had over-heated,"" he added. ""We then saw people rushing to get out of the station. Not necessarily running or panicking, but moving quickly. ""Then my partner saw a station staff member pointing a fire extinguisher at something and heard it go off, but we didn't see what it was directed at."" The Met said officers are ""working to establish the full facts"" A London Ambulance spokesperson said: ""We were called at 19:02 BST to an incident at Station Parade, N14. ""We have treated three patients at the scene for minor injuries and have taken two people to hospital."" Specialist officers said the cause of the explosion appeared to be a battery short circuit. Enquires are ongoing to establish the ""full facts"", a Met spokesman added. Cordons were put in place and the station was closed, although services are running this morning.

"Jack Gilbert, 23, Alberto Fresneda Carrasco, 19, and Harrison Scott-Hood, 23, were found dead on tracks near Loughborough Junction station Tributes have been paid to three men killed by a train near a south London station. Jack Gilbert, 23, Alberto Fresneda Carrasco, 19, and Harrison Scott-Hood, 23, were found dead on tracks near Loughborough Junction station on Monday. Mr Carrasco's family said they were ""painting graffiti late at night in a particularly dangerous place"". Mr Scott-Hood's parents said he was a ""beautiful artist"" and ""kind man"". Mr Gilbert's family said the only solace they could find in his death was that ""he died doing something he loved"". Railway graffiti: Props, respect and death British Transport Police (BTP) said it is believed they were hit by an out-of-service passenger train shortly after 01:00 BST on Monday. The train was forensically examined on Tuesday. Messages have been left to the trio at the station under the ""tags"" of Kbag, Lover and Trip Susie and Perry Scott-Hood said their son, from Muswell Hill, was ""loved by everyone"". ""He was an intelligent and wonderful boy who had so many close friends,"" they said. ""Many people will know Harrison loved to travel, he was a beautiful artist and spent time recently travelling around Vietnam and Cambodia. ""Harrison completed us. He is irreplaceable."" Spanish-American national Mr Carrasco, from Hampstead, was due to start a course in graphic design in September, his family said. A statement read: ""His absence has left a deep hole in the family. ""We believe the three were hit by a train when they were painting graffiti late at night in a particularly dangerous place."" Meanwhile family said Mr Gilbert from Enfield, north London, had ""endless"" generosity and ""lit up everyone's world just by being in it"". In a statement they added: ""There are no words to describe the devastation we feel. He was a wonderful son, brother, uncle and boyfriend. ""His talent for art even from an early age was exceptional,"" they added. ""Everyone loved Jack and the only solace we have is he died doing something he loved."" Police warned of the ""massive risk"" graffiti artists make by trespassing on train tracks At the scene, flowers and spray cans lie next to shutters spray-painted with ""RIP"" and love hearts. Messages were left to the trio under the ""tags"" of Kbag, Lover and Trip on social media. Many read ""Rest In Paint"", alongside images of painted tags on trains and walls. Evidence bags taken from the scene by officers contained spray cans Det Supt Gary Richardson from BTP said: ""We have a dedicated team working to establish how these young men came to be on the tracks. ""The initial evidence we have been able to gather indicates that the men may have been on the track for the purposes of spraying graffiti."" The force warned of the ""massive risk"" graffiti artists make by trespassing on train tracks. Outside Loughborough Junction station, flowers and spray cans lie next to shutters spray-painted with ""RIP"" By lunchtime today, a modest tribute had been left outside Loughborough Junction station - three bunches of flowers, three spray cans, and three letters sprayed in black - RIP.  Otherwise, there was little sign of the young lives lost just a short way along the track. I watched three teenage boys quietly add to the floral tributes, but it was the later arrival of a group of about 20 youngsters which marked a distinct change in the atmosphere. At least two of them took out spray cans and begun daubing the station walls with 'RIP' and the nicknames of the young victims - undeterred by the presence of journalists or station staff. They seemed angry and many were in tears. One boy, Sam, told me he was best friends with Alberto Fresneda Carrasco. He said 'Alby' had died doing what he loved. A girl, who was visibly upset, described them as 'just kids'. The graffiti they left amounts to criminal damage, but it doesn't look out of place. Almost every section of elevated railway infrastructure in sight had been sprayed - places I can't imagine anyone could reach safely. The manager of a nearby garage told me graffiti was a problem in the area. Another local businessman said he'd seen youngsters climb up onto railway bridges at night. Officers were called to the scene at about 07:30 on Monday and the three were pronounced dead. It is understood spray cans were found near the bodies. Officers could be seen taking photos of graffiti as part of their inquiries A tweet by former Transport for London (TfL) board member Brian Cooke described the dead men as ""common scum who cost the railway millions and keep fares high"". His account has since become private but was captured and shared by graffiti magazineFrontline,external. One Instagram user described the comments as ""insensitive and ignorant"", while another said he had gone ""too far"". A Twitter user wrote: ""Think before you vocalise such brutal opinions."" Mr Cooke was a TfL board member between 2012 and 2016. He was removed as chairman of London TravelWatch after breaching the terms of his appointment by declaring his support for Boris Johnson days before the 2008 mayoral election.

"This video can not be played Bodycam footage shows the moment firefighters entered the flat where the Grenfell Tower fire began Firefighters did not get into the kitchen where the Grenfell Tower fire started until five minutes after flames had spread through the external window, the official inquiry has heard. Crews had first entered the flat at 1:07 BST on 14 June 2017, 13 minutes after occupant Behailu Kebede rang 999. But it was a further seven minutes before they tackled the kitchen blaze. The kitchen's fire alarm had gone off after Mr Kebede's fridge caught fire. He and two other occupants escaped. Thermal-imaging footage, recorded that night, showed two firefighters smashing down the door to Flat 16, then making their way through a smoke-clogged hallway for several minutes. They then checked both bedrooms and the living room before entering the kitchen. The flat's three occupants had already managed to leave. The inquiry heard that Mr Kebede had been sleeping on a mattress in his living room when he was woken up by the fire alarm. He shut off the electricity in the flat before he and the two female occupants, named only as Ms Kinfu and Ms Afeworki, left the premises. A total of 72 people died as a result of the fire in North Kensington, west London. What happened at Grenfell Tower? Who were the victims? Grenfell Inquiry: What five reports reveal The Grenfell Tower Inquiry with Eddie Mair - Tuesday's podcast The footage showed the firefighters tackling the blaze in the kitchen by dousing the flames with water. They then closed the door but when they reopened it, there were more flames which indicated the fire had rapidly got worse. Forensic scientist Professor Niamh Nic Daeid, who described what was on the video, said: ""The camera now swings round and looks out of the window of the flat and you can see aspects of the cladding that are coming down outside of the window. ""The fridge-freezer can be seen with the top door missing and the bottom door open."" Images from the kitchen of flat 16 show the positioning of the kitchen appliances and the window. Footage taken from outside the tower block showed the fire first reaching the block's cladding at 1:09 BST, and by the time the firefighters had dealt with the blaze in the flat, flames were advancing quickly up the building. The fire would eventually re-enter the flat, and photos of the burnt-out wreckage in the flat were shown to the inquiry at Holborn Bars, London. Prof Nic Daeid said further tests on the fridge-freezer, thought to have started the fire, and other electrical appliances needed to be done before a cause of the fire can be determined.

"Men wearing kilts will be protected from a new ban on ""upskirting"" in England and Wales, a government spokeswoman has said. Baroness Vere of Norbiton said the proposed law would protect the ""bodily dignity"" of both men and women. She told the Lords this would include ""kilt upskirting"", as she briefed them about the government's plans. The government announced it was intervening after a backbench MP blocked an attempt to change the law. 'Pants protest' against Commons row MP May 'disappointed' at upskirting law block If passed, its new law would see someone who has secretly taken a photo under a victim's clothing face up to two years in prison. A bill will be introduced in the House of Commons on Thursday, with the government promising it will make progress before the summer recess begins. In the House of Lords, Labour's shadow attorney general Baroness Chakrabarti welcomed the proposed new law. ""Our feminism is to be judged by deeds not words,"" she said. ""Not only statues but statutes protecting all women's bodily integrity and dignity."" This video can not be played Christopher Chope says his actions have been misunderstood In response, government spokeswoman Baroness Vere said: ""This statute actually protects all men and women and their bodily dignities, as it does indeed include kilt upskirting, which I only recently became aware of."" In Scotland,a ban,external- which refers to operating equipment under people's clothing - has been in place since 2009. Conservative backbench MP Sir Christopher Chope faced a backlash on Friday when he shouted ""object"" to a backbench bill that would have introduced a specific upskirting offence in England and Wales, which campaigners say is needed to fill a gap in the current law. He said his actions had been ""cruelly misunderstood"", saying he recognised the seriousness of the offence and that his objection was over the practice of approving a new law without any real debate - as he suggested could have happened on Friday.

"Consumers in rural areas of the UK are far less likely to use their smartphones for banking than their urban counterparts, a survey says. The findings, from the UK's financial regulator, are set to reignite the debate over bank branch closures - particularly in rural locations. However, its report also suggests that those in rural areas are more satisfied with their financial circumstances. The Financial Conduct Authority also exposed a north-south savings divide. The data comes from a renewed assessment of a survey of 13,000 people's financial lives by the FCA. The survey,first published in Octoberlast year, found an estimated 4.1 million people are in financial difficulty due to missed domestic or credit bills. An older population and patchy broadband and mobile coverage will be among the reasons for a take-up rate of just 23% in mobile banking and a 54% take-up of internet banking in rural areas, compared with 45% and 78% respectively in urban areas. The report also reveals there is greater reliance on bank branches in rural areas, but also more difficulty in reaching those branches owing, in part, to health conditions. Andrew Bailey, FCA chief executive, said: ""This survey shows just how different the experience of financial services is for consumers across the country. That's important for us, as we shape financial services policy. But it is also important for firms, as they decide how best to serve their customers."" The report comes shortly after consumer group Which? reported an ""alarming"" acceleration in bank branch closures, with about 60 closing every month. It found that 2,868 branches will have closed between 2015 and the end of 2018. It questioned the use of technology as a viable alternative, but banks said closures of branches were a last resort and that Post Offices served many of the same functions. ""Looking after every customer, especially those in vulnerable circumstances, is a priority for the financial services sector,"" a spokesman for banking trade body UK Finance said. ""We will read the findings of the FCA's report with interest and look forward to working closely with the regulator to support customers"". Hannah Maundrell, from comparison website Money.co.uk, said: ""Millions of consumers in the UK are facing financial difficulty due to missed bills - without easy access to sort out these sort of debts, the lack of branches coupled with a lack of decent broadband and mobile signal in rural communities could create a perfect storm and really needs to be investigated."" The FCA's report also revealed that household average income in rural areas, at Â£41,000, was lower than the national average of Â£46,000. Just over half of retired people in rural areas relied mainly on the state pension, compared to 37% in urban areas. Yet, the proportion of people in the countryside who said they were highly satisfied with their financial circumstances (27%) was greater than those in towns and cities (20%). That may be a response to the fact that debts in rural areas are generally lower than the national average. Banks close 2,900 branches in three years, says Which? Essential bill arrears 'more likely among women' Crackdown on high-interest lending announced by FCA The FCA's main report,published last year,external, revealed that 25.6 million consumers could be vulnerable to financial harm. This new analysis of the figures outlines a regional difference, with a notable north-south divide in terms of income and levels of saving. For example, the north east of England has the lowest levels of savings and investments of any English region, with 17% of adults in the region not holding any savings or investments at all. This compares to 15% in the north west of England, 10% in the south west and 8% in the south east. Incomes are lower in these northern regions, although mortgage debts are also among the lowest. The survey suggests that attitudes towards finances in Northern Ireland are ""more downbeat"" than the rest of the UK. Two-thirds of adults (67%) in Northern Ireland have no cash savings or savings of less than Â£5,000, compared with 57% of adults across the UK. It also has the highest levels of debt across the UK, with adults in Northern Ireland owing Â£3,990 on average in unsecured debt. This is the first survey of its kind by the FCA. The next data on residents' financial circumstances will be collected in 2019.

"General Electric is losing its place on the Dow Jones Industrial Average after more than a century in a move that reflects its declining fortunes and a changing US economy. Walgreens Boots Alliance will take its spot on the financial index, which tracks shares of 30 companies deemed representative of the US economy. The change takes effect on 26 June. The firm that runs the index said the change was intended to reflect the growth of the healthcare sector. David Blitzer of S&P Dow Jones Indices said the change would make the Dow a ""better measure of the economy and the stock market"". The move follows a difficult period for General Electric, whose shares have more than halved in the past year. GE has replaced its chief executive and announced a series of cuts in an effort to reposition itself. GE said falling out of the Dow would not alter its commitment to creating a ""stronger, simpler"" company. One of the original companies included on the Dow, GE traces its roots to Thomas Edison's light bulb business founded in the 1890s. It became one of America's biggest companies - an industrial conglomerate that also owned the NBC Universal media company and operated a major finance division. Over the last decade, the firm has sold businesses including NBC, GE Capital and its appliances division, responding to losses triggered by the financial crisis and poor performance against competitors.

"Use of the European Arrest Warrant has increased steadily in the past decade The UK will be kicked out of the European Arrest Warrant deal after Brexit, EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier has said. The warrant allows EU members to request the arrest and detention of criminals in other countries without extradition talks between them. The UK wants to stay part of the system when it leaves the EU next March. But Mr Barnier said the UK could not, because of its desire to leave the EU's court and free movement scheme. The EU would consider setting up a ""streamlined"" extradition process with the UK instead, said Mr Barnier. Davis hits out at EU over Galileo Europol head fears loss of UK influence after Brexit Brexit: All you need to know UK reveals proposed EU security deal His words are not likely to go down well with the UK's Brexit Secretary David Davis, who earlier this month singled the European Arrest Warrant out as one of the cornerstones of post-Brexit security co-operation with the EU. He said it had ""brought dangerous people swiftly to justice"" and ""played a crucial role in supporting police co-operation, not least in Northern Ireland and Ireland"". Michel Barnier: 'We will not be drawn into this blame game' Mr Barnier said ""facts have consequences"" and the UK's decision to leave the EU and its single market meant things could not stay the way they were now. He said the UK's decision to opt out of free movement rules and largely end the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice ""means that the UK cannot take part in the European Arrest Warrant"". The UK wants an agreement with Europol that preserves existing benefits He suggested it would not be ""fair"" for the UK to keep all the benefits of EU membership. ""They want to maintain all the benefits of the current relationship, while leaving the EU regulatory, supervision, and application framework,"" he said. ""And they try to blame us for the consequences of their choice. Once again, we will not be drawn into this blame game. It would mean wasting time we don't have."" Mr Barnier said that aside from the European Court of Justice the arrest warrant was also underpinned by the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights and by the concept of EU citizenship. He added: ""Today we know that the UK is not ready to accept the free movement of people, the jurisdiction of the court and the Charter of Fundamental Rights - for the charter, this was confirmed last week by the House of Commons. ""This means that the UK cannot take part in the European Arrest Warrant."" The EU's remaining 27 countries would continue to share information from passenger name records and the UK would not have automatic access to EU-only police databases or those of countries in the Schengen zone, he said in a speech in Vienna. Similarly, while the UK would be shown analysis done by Europol relating to live criminal investigations, it would not be able to ""shape the direction"" of the EU's law enforcement agency or other EU bodies. Shared efforts to counter money-laundering and terrorist finance must continue, Mr Barnier said, but judicial co-operation in criminal matters could not extend to continued membership of the European Arrest Warrant. Successive UK governments have remained strong supporters of the European Arrest Warrant - which came into force in 2004 - despite calls from some Tory MPs for it to be renegotiated or reformed. According to the National Crime Agency, other EU members requested the arrest of 14,279 UK-based suspects in 2015-6, up from 1,865 in 2004. The UK made 241 such requests in 2015-6, leading to 150 arrests. Speaking at the same event as Mr Barnier, leading MEP Guy Verhofstadt said ""solutions were possible"" to ensure public safety was not compromised by Brexit but he made clear the status quo was not an option. ""They cannot be simply based on continuing the same processes as before,"" he said. In response, the Department for Exiting the European Union said protecting the public was an ""absolute priority"". ""Any drop in the breadth and quality of co-operation would have a direct impact on public safety and on our collective ability to deliver justice across Europe,"" a spokesman said. Earlier this year the chief constable of the Police Service of Northern Ireland said non-participation in the scheme was ""probably the biggest practical vulnerability"" facing law enforcement in Northern Ireland post-Brexit. George Hamilton told a House of Lords committee there would be ""very real operational consequences if there are no alternative arrangements in place around exchange of material and people by way of a European arrest warrant"".

It wasn't until years later, in 2009, that the United States re-joined under the Obama administration. Many allies have tried to convince the United States to remain in the council. Even many who agree with Washington's long standing criticisms of the body believe the United States should actively work to reform it from within, rather than disengaging. The UN set up the council in 2006 to replace the UN Commission on Human Rights, which faced widespread criticism for letting countries with poor human rights records become members. A group of 47 elected countries from different global regions serve for three-year terms on the council.

The hosts scored 481-6 in 50 overs - eclipsing their ownown record of 444-3,set against Pakistan at the same venue in 2016. Alex Hales hit 147 and Jonny Bairstow 139 as England briefly threatened to post 500 in the third ODI. Australia were bowled out for 239 in 37 overs as Adil Rashid took 4-47. England's win, which gave them an unassailable 3-0 lead in the series with two games to play, came only 11 days after New Zealand made the highest total in a women's ODI -490-4 against Ireland in Dublin. While the innings of Hales and Bairstow, which both lasted 92 balls, laid the platform, skipper Eoin Morgan provided the late impetus with a rapid 67. The left-hander hit a 21-ball half-century - the fastest by an England player - in becoming his country's all-time top ODI run-scorer. ""This is a poor Australian side who have been utterly dismantled,"" said BBC cricket correspondent Jonathan Agnew. ""It was ruthless from England. The wheels fell off for Australia."" Highest men's one-day international total. England's biggest ODI win and Australia's heaviest defeat in terms of runs. The record for most boundaries hit in an ODI with 62. The previous mark of 59 was held by England and Sri Lanka. Morgan become the first batsman to score 3,000 ODI runs in England and Wales Bairstow is only the eighth player to score four centuries in six ODI innings, after Virat Kohli, David Warner, Quinton de Kock, Kumar Sangakkara, Hashim Amla, AB de Villiers and Zaheer Abbas. Bairstow has hit four ODI centuries in 2018, equalling David Gower's record in a calendar year (1983). Bairstow & Roy recorded their fourth century opening stand, equalling the England record shared by Nick Knight and Marcus Trescothick. This video can not be played England break ODI record with Hales six Australia are without their first-choice bowling attack in this series - Mitchell Starc, Josh Hazlewood, Pat Cummins are sidelined with injury - but England have done this before at Trent Bridge. Their 444-3 against Pakistan - last year's Champions Trophy winners - came just 12 months after they chased down 349-7 to beat New Zealand in 2015. And coming less than 12 months before they host the 2019 World Cup - they play Pakistan at Trent Bridge in the group stages - this was another indicator that they deserve their tag of pre-tournament favourites. Holders Australia, who are ranked sixth in the world, are second favourites but on the evidence of this performance they have much work to do. Their bowling was flogged and, for the third time in the series, their batting faltered against England spinners Rashid and Moeen Ali. ""We're a long way off,"" said Australia captain Tim Paine. ""England are red hot - the best team in the world. ""Everyone has a plan for the World Cup. We have six guys to come back into this squad. Whereas today was as tough as it gets, today was the best place for our young team to learn."" Are ODIs too batsman-friendly? Analysis & vote Listen: TMS podcast following England's amazing victory England appeared on course for something special when openers Jason Roy, who made 82, and Bairstow added 159 for the first wicket inside 20 overs. Bairstow was happy to play second fiddle to Roy at first, the Surrey opener hitting four sixes in his 61-ball knock, including an incredible pull into the crowd at deep square leg off Billy Stanlake. This video can not be played England v Australia: Jason Roy hits first six of the day Once Roy was dismissed, Bairstow took control, mixing his more traditional shots along the ground with some brutal six-hitting. Part-time bowler D'Arcy Short was pummelled for two sixes either side of the wicket as Australia captain Tim Paine, who won the toss, desperately sought a solution. Australia ended up using eight bowlers as they tried to stem the flow of runs. Hales struck 16 fours and five sixes in his devastating knock and when he partnered with Morgan, the pair put on 124 in only 61 balls. Hales, on his home ground, admitted talk in the middle had turned to the possibility of 500, but that particular milestone was missed as wickets began to tumble. ""It's frightening to think that England probably should have got 500,"" England's leading Test wicket-taker James Anderson said on Test Match Special. This video can not be played Bairstow reaches 'wonderful hundred' with a six Australia, needing almost 10 an over to get close to their target, played their shots but were never likely to get close to saving the series. Only Travis Head was able to pass 50 as Rashid excelled once again and Moeen Ali took 3-28. This was the first time England's spinners have taken seven wickets against Australia in an ODI. The pair now have 17 wickets between them in three matches in comparison to Ashton Agar's combined figures of 1-150 in 24 overs for Australia. While England's fielding was tidy - Rashid and Moeen took a caught-and-bowled each and Bairstow effected a neat run-out - Australia were made to pay for their mistakes, in particular Marcus Stoinis' drop to reprieve Bairstow on 30. ""It's as close as we've ever been to a perfect day,"" said Morgan. ""It's as complete as performance as we've produced over the past three years. ""Everybody needs to be credited. The level of intensity is something we haven't reached before. ""With the ball and the field there was no let-up. It's a huge credit to the guys. ""If we continue to improve at the rate we have in the past three years, we'll put ourselves in the best possible position to win the World Cup.""

"Facebook has been ordered by a UK high court judge to reveal who told it to delete the profile of a jazz musician and his band, six months after he died. The Times reports that the firm said it had acted on a request but had declined to reveal to the family who had instructed it. Mirza Krupalija's partner Azra Sabados says she is certain that it was not a family member or friend. She said losing his posts and messages felt like losing him ""a second time"". Mr Krupalija, who lived in Sarajevo, suffered a fatal heart attack just after his 57th birthday in 2016. ""It's that feeling, you lose someone you love and you try to hang onto everything, and then something happens and you can't explain that either and nobody knows, none of the friends, none of the family,"" Ms Sabados told the BBC. ""Lots of Mirza's profile included me and our travels, our photos, music he shared, some for me, some for friends, his profile stated that he was in a relationship with me - they could have dropped me an email to check [before deleting it]."" Ms Sabados said she spent a year talking to Facebook before pursuing legal action. Facebook declined to comment. Ms Sabados' lawyer Greg Callus from the law firm 5BR confirmed to the BBC that Facebook is now required to provide the details under what is legally known as a Norwich Pharmacal Order - where Facebook is innocent but may have information about a third party who could be involved in wrongdoing. The firm will have 21 days to respond. ""The judgement was amazing,"" Ms Sabados said. ""It meant so much to me that in court the judge agreed that what was done was wrongdoing, it wasn't right, it wasn't fair, it caused a lot of distress. ""We want Facebook to say exactly what their process is when they receive such a request - behind that profile was a human being and there are lots of people affected, a circle of friends who love that person."" Ms Sabados and her friend Ognjen Savija launchedan online petition,externaltwo years ago calling on the firm to restore Mr Krupalija's profile and private messages. It has had over 850 signatures.

"This video can not be played 'Common sense has bust the system wide open' The use of medicinal cannabis is to be reviewed, which could lead to more prescriptions of drugs made from the plant, the home secretary has said. The decision was prompted by recent high-profile cases of children with severe epilepsy being denied access to cannabis oil to control seizures. But Sajid Javid stressed the drug would remain banned for recreational use. Charlotte Caldwell, whose son Billy has severe epilepsy, welcomed the decision after campaigning for change. What are the rules on cannabis oil? Boy discharged after getting cannabis oil Cannabis delay for epileptic boy 'cruel' Young 'think cannabis safer than alcohol' Speaking to the House of Commons, Mr Javid said the position ""we find ourselves in currently is not satisfactory"". Billy Caldwell and Alfie Dingley both have severe epilepsy He said the cases of Alfie Dingley and Billy Caldwell had made him conclude it was time to review the use of cannabis for medicinal purposes. The review would be held in two parts, Mr Javid told MPs. The first will make recommendations on which cannabis-based medicines might offer real medical and therapeutic benefits to patients. In the second part, the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs will consider whether changes should be made to the classification of these products after assessing ""the balance of harms and public health needs"". He said: ""If the review identifies significant medical benefits, then we do intend to reschedule [change the rules]."" He also announced that Alfie, from Kenilworth in Warwickshire, was being issued with a licence to receive cannabis-based drugs. The six-year-old has a very rare form of epilepsy that causes up to 150 seizures per month, His family had originally applied to the government in April, saying his condition improved after using cannabis oil in the Netherlands. This video can not be played Hannah Deacon reacts to news that her son, Alfie Dingley, has been granted a licence to receive cannabis-based drugs. Meanwhile, Billy, 12, from County Tyrone, was granted a20-day licence for the drug last weekafter doctors made clear it was a medical emergency. He was admitted to hospital after his seizures ""intensified"" following his supply being confiscated at Heathrow Airport. His mother Charlotte, speaking after Mr Javid's statement, said: ""Common sense and the power of mothers and fathers of sick children has bust the political process wide open and is on the verge of changing thousands of lives by bringing our medicinal cannabis laws in line with many other countries."" But she added that while it was a ""clearly largely positive"" announcement, ""we still want to hear the details"". Ms Caldwell also revealed that she has been asked to be on the panel of expertsset up on Monday by the governmentto assess individual applications for cannabis oil. Currently, anyone wishing to use a drug containing a controlled cannabis-based substance must apply to the Home Office for a licence - a process that Labour MP Andy McDonald, whose son died as a result of epilepsy, has described as ""tortuous"" and ""painful"". Each application is considered on its merits. This video can not be played Labour MP Andy McDonald said parents were ""living through the same fears"" he had experienced Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott welcomed Mr Javid's statement, telling MPs that it was ""long overdue"". Lady Meacher, who chairs the all-party parliamentary group for drug policy reform - which two years ago called for cannabis-based drugs to be legalised - said the move was a ""no brainer"" which could benefit many people. She said: ""About one million people, probably, could benefit from medical cannabis - people with severe pain, obviously children with terrible epilepsy. ""There are 200,000 people in this country with uncontrolled epileptic seizures; MS sufferers, people with Parkinson's, people with cancer. ""So there are just so many people who must be celebrating today, and I'm celebrating with them."" She compared cannabis with morphine, and said it was ""much, much safer, less addictive and has much, much less in the way of side effects"". By Chris Mason, political correspondent Amid the noise of politics, this row is a reminder of the power of desperate human stories and the power of a new arrival at the Home Office who has repeatedly shown his willingness to do the job his own way. Imagine, for a moment, the anguish of the families of Alfie Dingley and Billy Caldwell. The pain of a parent seeing their son suffer. And then having to walk outside the hospital door and front a political campaign. A matter of months ago, there was no prospect of a shift in the law. On the Windrush saga, on immigration, and now on medicinal cannabis, Sajid Javid is a home secretary putting his own stamp on the role. The UK's drugs regulations currently divide drugs into five ""schedules"", each specifying in what circumstances it is lawful to possess, supply, produce, export and import them. Cannabis is currently a Schedule 1, meaning it is thought to have no therapeutic value and therefore cannot be lawfully possessed or prescribed, but can be used for the purposes of research with a Home Office licence. Drugs in Schedules 2 and 3, such as methadone, can be prescribed and therefore legally possessed and supplied by pharmacists and doctors. One cannabis-based drug called Sativex, containing CBD and the banned THC - has been licensed in the UK to treat MS andis a Schedule 4.,external But Mr Javid added that the move to review medicinal cannabis use was ""in no way a first step to the legalisation of cannabis for recreational use"". Patients prescribed Sativex, who resupply it to other people, face prosecution. That followedcalls from former Conservative leader Lord Hague,who said the government should consider legalising the recreational use of cannabis. But NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens said it was important not to confuse the debate ""without at the same time reminding ourselves that there are some genuine health risks"" associated with smoking cannabis. By Michelle Roberts, BBC News online health editor Cannabis contains different active ingredients and experts say some of them might be therapeutic for certain patients. THC or tetrahydrocannabinol is the part that makes people feel ""high"", but CBD or cannabidiol is another component found in cannabis that scientists are interested in understanding more about as medical treatments. CBD-based treatments have shown some promising results for reducing seizures in children with severe epilepsies. Medical trials of cannabis-based medicines have largely focused on pharmacological preparations, but some parents of children with epilepsy have been buying oils containing CBD and THC. There is currently little scientific evidence on the safety and effectiveness of these oils as a treatment for epilepsy, although they do contain the same active ingredients. Some health food shops sell CBD oils as food supplements. These have low levels of active ingredient and are legal to buy in the UK. It is vital that you talk to your doctor or health professional before making any changes to your epilepsy medication.

"This video can not be played The sound of migrant children separated from parents US President Donald Trump has defended his policy of splitting up families entering the US illegally, defying a growing chorus of condemnation. Speaking at a business convention, Mr Trump said children had to be taken away if their parents were jailed for illegally crossing the US border. The president had earlier sparked outrage for tweeting that undocumented immigrants would ""infest"" the US. Mexico's foreign minister has called the US policy ""cruel and inhuman"". Mr Trump on Tuesday met Republican lawmakers to discuss a bill that proposes to curb the policy. ""I don't want children taken away from parents,"" Mr Trump said. ""When you prosecute the parents for coming in illegally - which should happen - you have to take the children away."" Mr Trump said he wanted to ""end the border crisis"" by giving border officials the resources to ""detain and remove illegal immigrant families altogether"". US immigration officials say 2,342 children have been separated from 2,206 parents from 5 May to 9 June amid a ""zero-tolerance"" crackdown on illegal immigration brought in by US Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Speaking on Monday evening, Mr Sessions rejected claims US holding centres for child migrants separated from their parents were like Nazi concentration camps.

On Tuesday, the co-creator of the sitcom Modern Family said he would cut ties with Fox's TV production studio because of Fox News' rhetoric around the Trump administration's immigration policy. Both Fox News and Fox's TV production studio are owned by 21st Century Fox, which is currently considering acquisition offers from US media conglomerates Disney and Comcast. ""I look forward to seeing Modern Family through to the end and then, sale or no sale, setting up shop elsewhere,"" Steve Levitan said. Mexican Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray Caso said on Tuesday that the separation of children from parents at the US border was ""cruel and inhuman"", and clearly violated human rights. The Salvadoran foreign ministry issued a statement on Monday saying the US policy was ""exposing children to extremely adverse conditions"". Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez said: ""Our position is that families should not be separated."" Guatemala has refrained from criticising the US, saying only that it respects other nations' migration policy. This video can not be played US child migrants: Five things to know Under the ""zero-tolerance"" crackdown that the Trump administration rolled out in May, all border crossers - including first-time offenders - are criminally charged and jailed. Migrant children are not permitted to be incarcerated with their parents, and are kept in separate facilities maintained by the Department of Health and Human Services. Under previous US administrations, undocumented immigrants caught crossing the border for the first time tended to be issued with court summonses. But the Trump administration points out that most of those migrants never showed up for court. Official images of the tent city for migrant children in Tornillo, Texas, were released on Monday The Trump administration has been disputing the terminology used to describe its immigration crackdown. The Department of Homeland Security has framed it as an ""initiative"" rather than ""a policy"". It describes the holding centres where children have been pictured behind metal chain-link enclosures with concrete floors as ""shelters"" instead of ""cages"". A lawyer defending the detained immigrantstells the Boston Globe,externalthat several of her clients had been told by Border Patrol agents that their children were being taken to be bathed - a tactic that has drawn further comparisons to the Holocaust. As the hours passed the mothers began to realise their children were not going to be immediately returned, according to lawyer Azalea Aleman-Bendiks. On Tuesday afternoon, the Republican president went to Congress, which is controlled by members of his party. He met with senior Republicans for an hour. The House of Representatives is preparing this week to vote on a moderate immigration bill. The compromise measure would limit, but not outright ban family separations. It would also offer an eventual path to citizenship for undocumented adult immigrants, known as Dreamers, who entered the US as children. The Republican legislation would also provide $25bn (Â£19bn) in funding for border security, including Mr Trump's planned US-Mexico wall. The White House says Mr Trump supports the package. A hardline conservative immigration bill is also in circulation, though it lacks enough support to be politically viable. Meanwhile, 21 Democratic state prosecutors demanded on Tuesday that the Department of Justice end the ""zero tolerance"" policy, arguing it ""is ignoring its legal and moral obligation for the sake of a political agenda at the expense of children"". ""Put simply, the deliberate separation of children and their parents who seek lawful asylum in America is wrong,"" the letter from the attorneys general reads, adding that the practice is ""contrary to American values"".

"This video can not be played Cannabis oil row: Mother calls for drug to be legalised A boy with severe epilepsy, who was admitted to hospital after his medical cannabis oil was confiscated, has been discharged. Billy Caldwell, 12, was treated with the drug in hospital after the Home Officegranted a 20-day licencefor the use of the banned substance. His mother says his seizures are reduced when he takes the oil and has called for it to be freely available. The government is creating an expert panel to look into individual cases. Home Office minister Nick Hurd told the House of Commons that the panel of clinicians, led by England's chief medical officer Dame Sally Davies, will advise ministers on any applications to prescribe the drug. He said Billy's case had ""highlighted the need for the government to explore the issue and our handling of these issues further"". But Billy's mother Charlotte Caldwell said there were still ""unanswered questions"". Speaking to Radio 4 she said: ""When will the panel be set up? When will it produce its report? ""This is something that has to be moved forward quickly and urgently."" Her comments followed earlier confusion when Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt suggested that Home Secretary Sajid Javid had launched a wider review of the law. But Prime Minister Theresa May said government would look only at the current system of licences for use in individual cases. ""There's a very good reason why we've got a set of rules around cannabis and other drugs, because of the impact that they have on people's lives, and we must never forget that,"" she said. Cannabis oil is used to control Billy's seizures Last weekofficials at Heathrow Airport confiscated Billy's cannabis oil,which Ms Caldwell had been attempting to bring into the UK from Canada. It contains a substance called Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), which is illegal in the UK but available elsewhere. She said that Billy had been taken to hospital in a ""life-threatening condition"" on Friday evening, leading the Home Office to intervene. During the weekend,Mr Javid granted a team at Chelsea and Westminster Hospital the 20-day licenceto administer the medicine. Ms Caldwell said: ""The fact that Billy has been discharged is testimony to the effectiveness of the treatment and underlines how vital it is that every child and every single family affected in our country should have immediate access to the very same medication."" The mother, from County Tyrone, said she has rented a flat in order to facilitate this temporary treatment. But she wants the law to be reformed, so Billy can have the medication administered at home. ""I will demand that the health department, not the Home Office, takes responsibility for providing access to medication for these incredibly sick children - this meeting must take place within 24 hours,"" Ms Caldwell said on Monday afternoon. It is uncertain what will happen when Billy's 20-day licence expires, and whether the Home Office will continue to allow him to use the drug. Raising an urgent question on the issue in the Commons, Gower MP Tonia Antoniazzi said there were two children - aged six and one - in her constituency who have a serious life-limiting condition and could ""benefit hugely"" from medicinal cannabis. This video can not be played Robbie Emerson spoke about his two-year-child who has up to 30 seizures a day. Other MPs also raised cases, includingthat of six-year-old Alfie Dingley, from Warwickshire, who also has epilepsy,whose family is awaiting a government decision on whether he can use cannabis oil medication. Former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith - who said he is ""by no means a supporter of recreational cannabis use"" - shared the case of a woman who, after being given two weeks to live because of a brain tumour, used a form of the drug to get rid of the tumour. This video can not be played Tonia Antoniazzi says medicinal cannabis should be given now to all who need it Antoinette Sandbach, the MP for Eddisbury, told of a constituent's two-year-old son who has 300 seizures a day, which were reduced to about 50 a day following the use of cannabis oil. Meanwhile, shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said the current system - even with the new expert panel announced - is ""simply not fit for purpose"" and called for the legalisation of cannabis oil for medical use. Shadow transport secretaryAndy McDonald, whose son died as a result of his epilepsy, also backed a change in the law, adding ""I'm speaking out in the hope that further deaths can be avoided.""

Psychological impact on separated children Fact-checking Trump on blame 'It's a deterrent' 11 May White House Chief of Staff John Kellytells NPR the zero-tolerance policy is to warn others,externalnot to come. ""They're not bad people. They're coming here for a reason. And I sympathise with the reason. But the laws are the laws. But a big name of the game is deterrence. ""The children will be taken care of - put into foster care or whatever. But the big point is they elected to come illegally into the United States and this is a technique that no one hopes will be used extensively or for very long.""

'We do not have a policy' 17 June Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen tweets: ""We do not have a policy of separating families at the border. Period."" 'It's not a deterrent' 18 June Ms Nielsen said she was ""offended"" at a question from a journalist that asked if the intention of the policy was to send a message. ""I find that offensive. No. Because why would I ever create a policy that purposely does that?"" Journalist: ""Perhaps as a deterrent."" Nielsen: ""No."" Tara McKelvey, White House reporter It's not easy to get your story straight in the Trump White House - Sessions has said family separations are ""necessary"" to stop illegal crossings. Yet Nielsen said she was ""offended"" at a question about whether families are separated in order to send a message about illegal crossings. The briefing on Monday itself reflected the way officials tussle with messaging. The briefing was scheduled at 13:15 - then moved to 15:30, then 16:00. At 17:00 Nielsen appeared - and sent out confusing messages. The process reflected an overall problem. Whether the issue's North Korea, immigration or trade, officials struggle to get on the same page. Part of the problem is they're working for a president who likes to communicate directly with the public and doesn't always keep his aides informed. And he changes his mind. Consequently officials struggle to deliver a clear message, leading to a trying - and topsy-turvy - day in the West Wing.

"This video can not be played Violent husband kept wife virtual prisoner for 16 years A husband who regularly beat his wife and kept her locked indoors during their 16-year marriage has been jailed. Aziz Rehman, 47, would only allow partner Zeenit Bibi to leave their home in Collingbourne Avenue, Hodge Hill, Birmingham when on the school run. He would wedge twigs in the front door whenever he went out so he could tell if she had left the house. Rehman was sentenced at Birmingham Crown Court on Tuesday to three years and nine months in prison. Midlands Live: Mum 'appealed to PM' on cannabis; 'Wall collapse' death investigated A jury found the businessman guilty in May of assault and coercive control. Mrs Bibi, 36, who married Rehman in December 2000, told the BBC she wanted other victims to speak out. ""I didn't think anybody was going to believe me, which was one of the reasons that I left it so long, because in the outside world he made it look like we were the perfect family,"" she said. ""Nobody deserves this kind of life - talk about it, let somebody know. Aziz Rehman hit his wife on the head with a dumbbell ""I had dumbbells put on my head, I had a foldable chair hit on my knee, I wasn't walking properly. ""I wasn't allowed to go the doctor, I wasn't allowed to be in the hospital. ""My ribs were done in, my knees were done in, and I told people 'it's OK - I fell over the lawnmower'."" Judge Roderick Henderson told Rehmen - who owns Arden Superstore and off licence in Arden Road, Saltley - that he controlled his wife ""as property"". He said: ""People are entitled to a basic level of respect from partners, not to be assaulted, bullied and controlled."" 10% of young women 'face domestic abuse' 'He wasn't happy until he had me all to himself' Police train to spot coercive behaviour Rehman, who denied the charges, ran their home like a ""prison"". One regular visitor told police how the curtains were always drawn and described him as an ""oppressor"". Mrs Bibi alerted West Midlands Police in July 2016 while her husband was out of the country and he was arrested following his return to the UK. PC Maria Watts said Mrs Bibi was ""tormented throughout her marriage"". ""She was forbidden from seeing friends and family, regularly assaulted, denied access to a mobile phone, and was effectively living a life of domestic servitude,"" she said.

"Boris Becker says the legal action being taken against him is ""unjustified and unjust"" Confusion surrounds a claim by former tennis champion Boris Becker that he holds diplomatic status on behalf of the Central African Republic (CAR). He asserted last week in London that his appointment as a diplomat by the CAR gave him protection from legal action in a bankruptcy case. The CAR embassy in Belgium confirmed it had issued him a diplomatic passport. However, a top official in the CAR foreign ministry told a French news agency the passport was fake. Cherubin Moroubama told AFP the serial number on the document matched one of a batch of ""new passports that were stolen in 2014"". He added that the passport, dated 19 March 2018, does not bear the signature or the stamp of the foreign minister. CAR foreign minister Charles Armel Doubane later told Reuters an inquiry was being launched into who had issued the passport. A country with bigger problems than Boris Becker What is diplomatic protection? Should diplomats still have immunity? Lawyers for the 50-year-old three-time Wimbledon champion say he was appointed a sport and culture attache to the EU by the CAR in April. In that month he tweeted a picture of himself shaking hands with CAR President Faustin-Archange Touadera in Brussels. Mr Becker was declared bankrupt in 2017 over money owed to private bank Arbuthnot Latham and is now being pursued for ""further assets"". In his defence lodged with the High Court in London last week, Mr Becker's lawyers maintained he could not be made subject to any legal process unless President Touadera specifically lifted his immunity at the request of the British government. Mr Becker's photo appeared on the website of the CAR embassy in Brussels His legal team said: ""This means he cannot be subject to legal process in the courts of any country for so long as he remains a recognised diplomatic agent."" But on Tuesday, Mr Moroubama was quoted by AFP as saying that ""Becker's job profile does not exist"" in the CAR's records. He added that the document in question describes Becker's diplomatic role as ""financial charge de mission... nothing to do with sporting questions"". Mr Becker's lawyers have not yet responded. The tennis star became the first German to win Wimbledon in 1985, at the age of 17. He won it again in 1986 and 1989 among the 64 ATP Tour titles he claimed during a 15-year career. After his retirement as a player he became a commentator with the BBC.

"Naa'imur Zakariyah Rahman and Mohammad Imran are both on trial at the Old Bailey An Islamic State fanatic plotted to kill Theresa May in a suicide attack, ""by blade and explosion"", on Downing Street, a court has been told. Naa'imur Zakariyah Rahman, 20, from London, has gone on trial accused of two terror charges, which he denies. The court heard his plan to inflict ""lethal violence"" was uncovered by an MI5 agent, who posed as an IS official and chatted to him on a messaging app. The court heard he said in one chat the Manchester Arena bomber ""did well"". The trial at London's Old Bailey was also told that Mr Rahman believed he was ""just days away"" from the attack before he was arrested in November last year. Mr Rahman, of Finchley, north London, is charged with preparing terrorist acts by conducting reconnaissance, recording a pledge of allegiance, and delivering a rucksack and jacket to be fitted with explosives. He is also charged with helping a second defendant, Mohammad Aqib Imran, 22, to join IS in Syria by recording a sponsorship video. Mr Rahman denies both counts. Mr Imran, of Sparkbrook, Birmingham, has pleaded not guilty to preparing terrorist acts and possessing a document on his Kindle entitled How To Survive In The West - A Mujahid's Guide 2015. On the opening day of his trial, the jury was told how Mr Rahman was originally snared in September last year, during a Telegram chat with an MI5 operative, who was pretending to be a man called Amir in Syria. Mr Rahman allegedly asked ""Amir"": ""Can you put me in a sleeper cell ASAP?"" The court heard how Mr Rahman told the agent that he was being investigated because of his uncle. Mr Rahman's uncle joined IS in Syria and encouraged his nephew to attack Britain before being killed in a drone strike in Syria, the prosecutors said. Jurors were told that Mr Rahman, when asked for more information in the Telegram chat, told the agent: ""I want to do a suicide bomb on Parliament. I want to attempt to kill Theresa May."" In another exchange the following day, Mr Rahman allegedly said: ""My objective is to take out my target. Nothing less than the death of the leaders of Parliament."" The court heard how he also praised the Manchester Arena bomber and said he had thought about wearing ""a vest"" while driving past Parliament before ""pushing the button"" to ""clear the entire block"". Mr Rahman allegedly added: ""Everyone inside, including the Prime Minister, would be dead."" Prosecutor Mark Heywood told the court: ""His settled conclusion was that lethal violence here, directed at the very heart of the United Kingdom government, was the only effective way to pursue his intentions. ""Before his arrest prevented it, he was, he believed, just days away from his objective, which was no less than a suicide attack, by blade and explosion, on Downing Street and, if he could, upon the Prime Minister Theresa May herself."" Mr Heywood, prosecuting, claimed how both defendants - Mr Rahman and Mr Imran - knew each other well and shared the ""warped ideology"" of IS. He said: ""The evidence shows in detail [Mr Rahman's] developing fervour as he first assembled his plan, carried out reconnaissance and perfected his ideas and then acquired the means to execute it. ""At the last he took back his own coat and his own rucksack both modified with improvised explosive devices, so that he could achieve his settled aim of a full-frontal assault on the gates and then the door of Number 10. ""In this he expected to die. But he also hoped for personal reward beyond death and, in doing so, to cause death and great fear in a place and to people symbolic of the country itself.""

"Stephen Gibney had no recollection of urinating on his victim A drunk who urinated on a sleeping homeless man ""as a joke"" has been jailed for eight weeks. Richard Stanley woke to find Stephen Gibney urinating on his face and laughing following a night of drinking in Liverpool city centre. A district judge said the offence was an act of ""gratuitous degradation"" and an ""attack"" on the victim's home. Gibney, 32, of  Rimmer Avenue, Childwall, admitted assault by beating at Liverpool Magistrates' Court. Jane Stacey, prosecuting, told the court that just before 05:00 BST on 18 May, Richard Stanley was sleeping rough in the Whitechapel area when he woke to find Gibney and another man standing over him. ""He opened his eyes and saw two men both laughing and realised the defendant was urinating on his face and his coat next to him and his worldly possessions,"" she added. When the victim said he was going to call the police, Gibney told him: ""I'll fight you right now. What are you going to do about it?"" Gibney was arrested at the scene and had no recollection of the incident when interviewed by police, the court heard. Sentencing, District Judge Wendy Lloyd told Gibney the offence was ""a deliberate act of degradation of a homeless person. ""It was his home, his little pitch where he was trying to establish himself as a human being and a valuable human being just like everyone else. ""He is in no way to be looked down upon, to be judged or dealt with in any lesser way than anyone else in society. ""This was this man's home where he was lying with his sleeping bag getting shelter. ""Apparently, to you and your companion this was just a joke."" Keiran Fielding, defending, said Gibney had had a considerable amount to drink but accepted his behaviour had been ""vile.""

"Charity In Kind Direct provides essentials such as toothpaste, soap, sanitary products and toilet rolls to schools A primary school is considering providing a washing machine for parents who cannot afford to keep their children's clothes clean. The head teacher of St Paul's Church of England Primary School in Stoke-on-Trent said she has spent her own money buying items for pupils. Nicola Finney said it was due to a rise in children attending school with ""washing and hygiene issues"". A study found more than 40% of parents cannot afford basic hygiene products. Ms Finney said staff at her school were considering installing a washing machine. The charity which carried out the survey, In Kind Direct, provides her school with essentials such as toothpaste, soap, sanitary products and toilet roll. Midlands Live: Mum 'appealed to PM' on cannabis; 'Wall collapse' death investigated ""We now make allowances in our very tight school budget to make sure we can buy personal hygiene and washing items, such as toiletries, washing powder and toothpaste, as well as spare uniforms, shoes and deodorant, because we know increasing numbers of families simply can't afford to buy them,"" Ms Finney said. ""We have seen significantly more children coming into school with washing and hygiene issues over the last few years. ""It used to be just a couple of children across the school, but now there are two or three in every classroom dealing with these issues. ""We want all of our pupils to get the best outcomes, not just those that can afford the basic essentials to keep themselves and their clothes clean and presentable."" School bans pencil cases to stop 'stigma' 'Junk food for exams' school head banned Children 'sent to school in nappies' Of the 2,000 parents of primary-age children surveyed, nearly a fifth admitted their child wore the same underwear for at least two days in a row. Some 14% said they have struggled to afford soap and shampoo, while 43% admitted they had to forgo basic hygiene or cleaning products because they cannot afford them. A quarter of the parents, who were randomly selected to take the online survey, also said their children have to wear the same shirt or blouse for at least a week.

The hosts scored 481-6 in 50 overs - eclipsing their ownown record of 444-3,set against Pakistan at the same venue in 2016. Alex Hales hit 147 and Jonny Bairstow 139 as England briefly threatened to post 500 in the third ODI. Australia were bowled out for 239 in 37 overs as Adil Rashid took 4-47. England's win, which gave them an unassailable 3-0 lead in the series with two games to play, came only 11 days after New Zealand made the highest total in a women's ODI -490-4 against Ireland in Dublin. While the innings of Hales and Bairstow, which both lasted 92 balls, laid the platform, skipper Eoin Morgan provided the late impetus with a rapid 67. The left-hander hit a 21-ball half-century - the fastest by an England player - in becoming his country's all-time top ODI run-scorer. ""This is a poor Australian side who have been utterly dismantled,"" said BBC cricket correspondent Jonathan Agnew. ""It was ruthless from England. The wheels fell off for Australia."" Highest men's one-day international total. England's biggest ODI win and Australia's heaviest defeat in terms of runs. The record for most boundaries hit in an ODI with 62. The previous mark of 59 was held by England and Sri Lanka.

Bairstow has hit four ODI centuries in 2018, equalling David Gower's record in a calendar year (1983). Bairstow & Roy recorded their fourth century opening stand, equalling the England record shared by Nick Knight and Marcus Trescothick.

Their 444-3 against Pakistan - last year's Champions Trophy winners - came just 12 months after they chased down 349-7 to beat New Zealand in 2015. And coming less than 12 months before they host the 2019 World Cup - they play Pakistan at Trent Bridge in the group stages - this was another indicator that they deserve their tag of pre-tournament favourites. Holders Australia, who are ranked sixth in the world, are second favourites but on the evidence of this performance they have much work to do. Their bowling was flogged and, for the third time in the series, their batting faltered against England spinners Rashid and Moeen Ali. ""We're a long way off,"" said Australia captain Tim Paine. ""England are red hot - the best team in the world. ""Everyone has a plan for the World Cup. We have six guys to come back into this squad.

Bairstow was happy to play second fiddle to Roy at first, the Surrey opener hitting four sixes in his 61-ball knock, including an incredible pull into the crowd at deep square leg off Billy Stanlake. This video can not be played England v Australia: Jason Roy hits first six of the day Once Roy was dismissed, Bairstow took control, mixing his more traditional shots along the ground with some brutal six-hitting. Part-time bowler D'Arcy Short was pummelled for two sixes either side of the wicket as Australia captain Tim Paine, who won the toss, desperately sought a solution. Australia ended up using eight bowlers as they tried to stem the flow of runs. Hales struck 16 fours and five sixes in his devastating knock and when he partnered with Morgan, the pair put on 124 in only 61 balls. Hales, on his home ground, admitted talk in the middle had turned to the possibility of 500, but that particular milestone was missed as wickets began to tumble. ""It's frightening to think that England probably should have got 500,"" England's leading Test wicket-taker James Anderson said on Test Match Special. This video can not be played Bairstow reaches 'wonderful hundred' with a six Australia, needing almost 10 an over to get close to their target, played their shots but were never likely to get close to saving the series. Only Travis Head was able to pass 50 as Rashid excelled once again and Moeen Ali took 3-28. This was the first time England's spinners have taken seven wickets against Australia in an ODI. The pair now have 17 wickets between them in three matches in comparison to Ashton Agar's combined figures of 1-150 in 24 overs for Australia. While England's fielding was tidy - Rashid and Moeen took a caught-and-bowled each and Bairstow effected a neat run-out - Australia were made to pay for their mistakes, in particular Marcus Stoinis' drop to reprieve Bairstow on 30. ""It's as close as we've ever been to a perfect day,"" said Morgan. ""It's as complete as performance as we've produced over the past three years. ""Everybody needs to be credited. The level of intensity is something we haven't reached before. ""With the ball and the field there was no let-up. It's a huge credit to the guys. ""If we continue to improve at the rate we have in the past three years, we'll put ourselves in the best possible position to win the World Cup.""

"Use of the European Arrest Warrant has increased steadily in the past decade The UK will be kicked out of the European Arrest Warrant deal after Brexit, EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier has said. The warrant allows EU members to request the arrest and detention of criminals in other countries without extradition talks between them. The UK wants to stay part of the system when it leaves the EU next March. But Mr Barnier said the UK could not, because of its desire to leave the EU's court and free movement scheme. The EU would consider setting up a ""streamlined"" extradition process with the UK instead, said Mr Barnier. Davis hits out at EU over Galileo Europol head fears loss of UK influence after Brexit Brexit: All you need to know UK reveals proposed EU security deal His words are not likely to go down well with the UK's Brexit Secretary David Davis, who earlier this month singled the European Arrest Warrant out as one of the cornerstones of post-Brexit security co-operation with the EU. He said it had ""brought dangerous people swiftly to justice"" and ""played a crucial role in supporting police co-operation, not least in Northern Ireland and Ireland"". Michel Barnier: 'We will not be drawn into this blame game' Mr Barnier said ""facts have consequences"" and the UK's decision to leave the EU and its single market meant things could not stay the way they were now. He said the UK's decision to opt out of free movement rules and largely end the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice ""means that the UK cannot take part in the European Arrest Warrant"". The UK wants an agreement with Europol that preserves existing benefits He suggested it would not be ""fair"" for the UK to keep all the benefits of EU membership. ""They want to maintain all the benefits of the current relationship, while leaving the EU regulatory, supervision, and application framework,"" he said. ""And they try to blame us for the consequences of their choice. Once again, we will not be drawn into this blame game. It would mean wasting time we don't have."" Mr Barnier said that aside from the European Court of Justice the arrest warrant was also underpinned by the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights and by the concept of EU citizenship. He added: ""Today we know that the UK is not ready to accept the free movement of people, the jurisdiction of the court and the Charter of Fundamental Rights - for the charter, this was confirmed last week by the House of Commons. ""This means that the UK cannot take part in the European Arrest Warrant."" The EU's remaining 27 countries would continue to share information from passenger name records and the UK would not have automatic access to EU-only police databases or those of countries in the Schengen zone, he said in a speech in Vienna. Similarly, while the UK would be shown analysis done by Europol relating to live criminal investigations, it would not be able to ""shape the direction"" of the EU's law enforcement agency or other EU bodies. Shared efforts to counter money-laundering and terrorist finance must continue, Mr Barnier said, but judicial co-operation in criminal matters could not extend to continued membership of the European Arrest Warrant. Successive UK governments have remained strong supporters of the European Arrest Warrant - which came into force in 2004 - despite calls from some Tory MPs for it to be renegotiated or reformed. According to the National Crime Agency, other EU members requested the arrest of 14,279 UK-based suspects in 2015-6, up from 1,865 in 2004. The UK made 241 such requests in 2015-6, leading to 150 arrests. Speaking at the same event as Mr Barnier, leading MEP Guy Verhofstadt said ""solutions were possible"" to ensure public safety was not compromised by Brexit but he made clear the status quo was not an option. ""They cannot be simply based on continuing the same processes as before,"" he said. In response, the Department for Exiting the European Union said protecting the public was an ""absolute priority"". ""Any drop in the breadth and quality of co-operation would have a direct impact on public safety and on our collective ability to deliver justice across Europe,"" a spokesman said. Earlier this year the chief constable of the Police Service of Northern Ireland said non-participation in the scheme was ""probably the biggest practical vulnerability"" facing law enforcement in Northern Ireland post-Brexit.

"Boris Becker says the legal action being taken against him is ""unjustified and unjust"" Confusion surrounds a claim by former tennis champion Boris Becker that he holds diplomatic status on behalf of the Central African Republic (CAR). He asserted last week in London that his appointment as a diplomat by the CAR gave him protection from legal action in a bankruptcy case. The CAR embassy in Belgium confirmed it had issued him a diplomatic passport. However, a top official in the CAR foreign ministry told a French news agency the passport was fake. Cherubin Moroubama told AFP the serial number on the document matched one of a batch of ""new passports that were stolen in 2014"". He added that the passport, dated 19 March 2018, does not bear the signature or the stamp of the foreign minister. CAR foreign minister Charles Armel Doubane later told Reuters an inquiry was being launched into who had issued the passport. A country with bigger problems than Boris Becker What is diplomatic protection? Should diplomats still have immunity? Lawyers for the 50-year-old three-time Wimbledon champion say he was appointed a sport and culture attache to the EU by the CAR in April. In that month he tweeted a picture of himself shaking hands with CAR President Faustin-Archange Touadera in Brussels. Mr Becker was declared bankrupt in 2017 over money owed to private bank Arbuthnot Latham and is now being pursued for ""further assets"". In his defence lodged with the High Court in London last week, Mr Becker's lawyers maintained he could not be made subject to any legal process unless President Touadera specifically lifted his immunity at the request of the British government. Mr Becker's photo appeared on the website of the CAR embassy in Brussels His legal team said: ""This means he cannot be subject to legal process in the courts of any country for so long as he remains a recognised diplomatic agent."" But on Tuesday, Mr Moroubama was quoted by AFP as saying that ""Becker's job profile does not exist"" in the CAR's records. He added that the document in question describes Becker's diplomatic role as ""financial charge de mission... nothing to do with sporting questions"". Mr Becker's lawyers have not yet responded. The tennis star became the first German to win Wimbledon in 1985, at the age of 17. He won it again in 1986 and 1989 among the 64 ATP Tour titles he claimed during a 15-year career. After his retirement as a player he became a commentator with the BBC.

"Matteo Salvini has campaigned in the past for Roma camps to be bulldozed Italy's right-wing populist Interior Minister, Matteo Salvini, has prompted a new outcry by saying he wants a census of the Roma community that would lead to non-Italians being deported. After a chorus of criticism he said his only aim was to protect Roma children. There are at least 130,000 Roma (Gypsies) in Italy, and many live in unlicensed camps on city outskirts. Last week Mr Salvini refused to allow a charity ship carrying 629 migrants into Italy. He has tried to limit the number of migrants entering Italy by blocking charity ships that rescue people off the Libyan coast.The Aquarius eventually arrived in the Spanish port of Valencia at the weekend. Since Mr Salvini's League party came to power this month with the anti-establishment Five Star movement, he has focused heavily on immigration. His remarks on Roma were eventually rebutted by his fellow deputy prime minister and leader of Five Star, Luigi di Maio, who made clear that a census was unconstitutional. United Nations human rights official Birgit Van Hout condemned Mr Salvini's comments. ""One does not stop to be a human being because one is born outside the European Union, and therefore everybody is entitled to be treated with dignity and respect,"" Ms Van Hout told the BBC. The interior minister told a local TV channel he had asked officials to ""prepare a dossier on the Roma question in Italy at the ministry because nothing has been done since [ex-minister Roberto] Maroni and it's chaos"". There would be a survey to see ""who [they are], how [they live] and how many of them there are, re-doing what was called the census"". ""We'll have a register,"" he said. Those Roma who had no right to stay in Italy would be deported but ""as for the Italian Roma, unfortunately you have to keep them at home"". Italy's new populist government has as part of its programme a plan to deport 500,000 migrants. Italy populists take power: What comes next? 'Roma inequalities span Europe' An association that promotes Roma rights immediately pointed out that any census based on ethnic background was against Italian law and political opponents expressed horror at the idea. Jewish groups said the plan evoked memories of Mussolini's 1938 race laws. Paolo Gentiloni, the centre-left prime minister who led Italy for two years, tweeted: ""Refugees yesterday, Roma today, tomorrow guns for all. How exhausting it is being bad."" Allow Twitter content?

Mr Di Maio welcomed Mr Salvini's clarification, saying he was glad that the minister had denied plans for a register. ""If something is unconstitutional, it cannot be done."" By James Reynolds, Rome In every way, the Roma in Italy live on the fringes of Italian life. Their camps are built on the outskirts of many of the country's biggest cities. Many of these settlements are unlicensed and have become de facto shanty towns. In Florence, I met a Western nun who hired Roma workers to tend to a graveyard. She insisted that they had been so marginalised by mainstream Italian society that they had no chance to find a way into regular work. But many Italians blame the Roma for choosing to live on the margins. There's a widespread perception that Roma children are taught how to steal. As a result, there will be support for Matteo Salvini's call to investigate whether or not Roma children have been properly enrolled in schools. They number between 130,000 and 170,000 and around half have Italian citizenship. Many come from Romania and the former Yugoslavia. Italians have an overwhelmingly negative view of Roma, according toa survey published in 2016 by the Pew Research Center,external. Some 82% of those questioned were unfavourable to Roma, far higher than other European countries. Matteo Salvini began his electoral campaign this year at a Roma camp on the outskirts of Turin Mr Salvini has long campaigned against the Roma community and has in the past called for their camps to be bulldozed. Two months ago he said if many of them worked harder and stole less, and educated their children in school rather than in theft, ""that would really be a party"". In answer to Mr Salvini's proposals, the 21 July Association that supports Roma rights said the numbers and details of Roma were already known. The Italian Roma community had been in the country for at least half a century, it said, while the few Roma who had no papers were in effect stateless so could not be deported anyway. Roma filmmaker Luciano Casamonica said the interior minister could say what he liked but he and his family had been in Italy for seven generations. Italy populists take power: What comes next?

As a result, there will be support for Matteo Salvini's call to investigate whether or not Roma children have been properly enrolled in schools. They number between 130,000 and 170,000 and around half have Italian citizenship. Many come from Romania and the former Yugoslavia. Italians have an overwhelmingly negative view of Roma, according toa survey published in 2016 by the Pew Research Center,external. Some 82% of those questioned were unfavourable to Roma, far higher than other European countries. Matteo Salvini began his electoral campaign this year at a Roma camp on the outskirts of Turin Mr Salvini has long campaigned against the Roma community and has in the past called for their camps to be bulldozed. Two months ago he said if many of them worked harder and stole less, and educated their children in school rather than in theft, ""that would really be a party"". In answer to Mr Salvini's proposals, the 21 July Association that supports Roma rights said the numbers and details of Roma were already known. The Italian Roma community had been in the country for at least half a century, it said, while the few Roma who had no papers were in effect stateless so could not be deported anyway. Roma filmmaker Luciano Casamonica said the interior minister could say what he liked but he and his family had been in Italy for seven generations. Italy populists take power: What comes next?

"This video can not be played The sound of migrant children separated from parents US President Donald Trump has defended his policy of splitting up families entering the US illegally, defying a growing chorus of condemnation. Speaking at a business convention, Mr Trump said children had to be taken away if their parents were jailed for illegally crossing the US border. The president had earlier sparked outrage for tweeting that undocumented immigrants would ""infest"" the US. Mexico's foreign minister has called the US policy ""cruel and inhuman"". Mr Trump on Tuesday met Republican lawmakers to discuss a bill that proposes to curb the policy. ""I don't want children taken away from parents,"" Mr Trump said. ""When you prosecute the parents for coming in illegally - which should happen - you have to take the children away."" Mr Trump said he wanted to ""end the border crisis"" by giving border officials the resources to ""detain and remove illegal immigrant families altogether"". US immigration officials say 2,342 children have been separated from 2,206 parents from 5 May to 9 June amid a ""zero-tolerance"" crackdown on illegal immigration brought in by US Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Speaking on Monday evening, Mr Sessions rejected claims US holding centres for child migrants separated from their parents were like Nazi concentration camps.

On Tuesday, the co-creator of the sitcom Modern Family said he would cut ties with Fox's TV production studio because of Fox News' rhetoric around the Trump administration's immigration policy. Both Fox News and Fox's TV production studio are owned by 21st Century Fox, which is currently considering acquisition offers from US media conglomerates Disney and Comcast. ""I look forward to seeing Modern Family through to the end and then, sale or no sale, setting up shop elsewhere,"" Steve Levitan said. Mexican Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray Caso said on Tuesday that the separation of children from parents at the US border was ""cruel and inhuman"", and clearly violated human rights. The Salvadoran foreign ministry issued a statement on Monday saying the US policy was ""exposing children to extremely adverse conditions"". Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez said: ""Our position is that families should not be separated."" Guatemala has refrained from criticising the US, saying only that it respects other nations' migration policy. This video can not be played US child migrants: Five things to know Under the ""zero-tolerance"" crackdown that the Trump administration rolled out in May, all border crossers - including first-time offenders - are criminally charged and jailed. Migrant children are not permitted to be incarcerated with their parents, and are kept in separate facilities maintained by the Department of Health and Human Services. Under previous US administrations, undocumented immigrants caught crossing the border for the first time tended to be issued with court summonses. But the Trump administration points out that most of those migrants never showed up for court. Official images of the tent city for migrant children in Tornillo, Texas, were released on Monday The Trump administration has been disputing the terminology used to describe its immigration crackdown. The Department of Homeland Security has framed it as an ""initiative"" rather than ""a policy"". It describes the holding centres where children have been pictured behind metal chain-link enclosures with concrete floors as ""shelters"" instead of ""cages"". A lawyer defending the detained immigrantstells the Boston Globe,externalthat several of her clients had been told by Border Patrol agents that their children were being taken to be bathed - a tactic that has drawn further comparisons to the Holocaust. As the hours passed the mothers began to realise their children were not going to be immediately returned, according to lawyer Azalea Aleman-Bendiks. On Tuesday afternoon, the Republican president went to Congress, which is controlled by members of his party. He met with senior Republicans for an hour. The House of Representatives is preparing this week to vote on a moderate immigration bill. The compromise measure would limit, but not outright ban family separations. It would also offer an eventual path to citizenship for undocumented adult immigrants, known as Dreamers, who entered the US as children. The Republican legislation would also provide $25bn (Â£19bn) in funding for border security, including Mr Trump's planned US-Mexico wall. The White House says Mr Trump supports the package. A hardline conservative immigration bill is also in circulation, though it lacks enough support to be politically viable. Meanwhile, 21 Democratic state prosecutors demanded on Tuesday that the Department of Justice end the ""zero tolerance"" policy, arguing it ""is ignoring its legal and moral obligation for the sake of a political agenda at the expense of children"". ""Put simply, the deliberate separation of children and their parents who seek lawful asylum in America is wrong,"" the letter from the attorneys general reads, adding that the practice is ""contrary to American values"".

"The new threat comes after Beijing vowed to retaliate against US tariffs on $50bn worth of Chinese goods US President Donald Trump has threatened to impose tariffs on an additional $200bn (Â£151bn) of Chinese goods in a growing trade row. Mr Trump said the 10% tariffs would come into effect if China ""refuses to change its practices"". The threats would be a major escalation of the dispute and sparked further falls on stock markets. In the US,the Dow Joneswas down more than 300 points (1.6%) when trading opened in New York on Tuesday. Stock markets in Asia had fallen sharply earlier, with Shanghai faring the worst, down 3.8%. European markets also suffered, with some trading more than 1% lower. China responded by accusing the US of ""blackmail"", raising fears of a full-blown trade war. Its commerce ministry said the country would take ""qualitative"" and ""quantitative"" measures and ""fight back firmly"" against additional tariff measures by the US government. Mr Trump insists that China has been unfairly benefiting from a trade imbalance with the US for years. During the 2016 election campaign, he promised to use tariffs to cut the US trade deficits. But many economists have warned that tariffs are likely to make products more expensive for US consumers and hurt some of the businesses the administration is trying to protect, which depend on China for parts or assembly. What is a trade war and why should I worry? China vows fast response to US tariffs G7 summit ends in disarray over tariffs US tariffs a dangerous game, says EU Last week, Mr Trump confirmed that the US would impose 25% tariffs on $50bn worth of Chinese goods. Beijing responded by saying it would hit 659 US products worth $50bn - including agricultural products, cars and marine products - with a similar tax. This video can not be played How hogs and Harleys became weapons in a looming trade war Late on Monday, the US president condemned China's ""unfair practices related to the acquisition of American intellectual property and technology"". He added: ""Rather than altering those practices, it is now threatening United States companies, workers, and farmers who have done nothing wrong."" Mr Trump added that new tariffs would ""go into effect if China refuses to change its practices, and also if it insists on going forward with the new tariffs that it has recently announced"". ""If China increases its tariffs yet again, we will meet that action by pursuing additional tariffs on another $200bn of goods."" China's commerce ministry reacted swiftly, saying: ""If the US acts irrationally and issues a list, China will have no choice but to take comprehensive measures of a corresponding number and quality and take strong, powerful countermeasures."" January 2018- The US announces tariffs on imported solar panels and washing machines March- Mr Trump unveils plans for a 25% tariff on steel imports and a 10% charge on aluminium April- China announces tariffs on US imports ranging from 15% to 25% on goods ranging from steel pipes to pork May- The US and China put tariff plans ""on hold"" after talks June- Mr Trump decides to push on with plans to impose tariffs in July One analyst wondered if performance at the polls might be behind Mr Trump's latest move. Ritu Vohora of M&G Investments toldBBC Radio 4's Today programme:""There is a lot more at stake here for Trump with the mid-term elections in November. China clearly is very much wanting to be this global tech leader, so neither side really wants to back down."" BBC economics correspondent Andrew Walker Being tough with China plays well with many of President Trump's supporters, actual and potential, at a time when he is looking ahead to the Congressional elections in November. It could also be that he thinks China will run out of US imports against which to retaliate. After all, the US sells a lot less to China than the other way around. But there is also a potential political cost for the president. Many in the Republican Party, who are more instinctively in favour of free trade, don't think this is the right way to tackle problems with China. And as Mr Trump increases the range of goods subject to tariffs it becomes harder for American importers and consumers to avoid the cost by finding alternative suppliers. In the separate dispute about steel and aluminium tariffs, he also has to contend with the politically targeted retaliation that other countries such as Mexico, Canada and the EU have in hand, intended to hit important states in the mid-term elections. The US tariffs previously announced affect more than 800 Chinese products from aircraft tyres to turbines and commercial dishwashers worth $34bn and are due to come into effect on 6 July. In his latest statement, Mr Trump said that he had asked his advisers to identify additional Chinese products on which to impose new tariffs. The White House says China encourages transfer of intellectual property - design and product ideas - to Chinese companies, through measures such as requiring that foreign firms share ownership with local partners to access the Chinese market.

"A look at eye-catching policy ideas that are often talked about but never seem to feature in UK general election campaigns. Drug prohibition began in the UK during World War I, when the possession, distribution and sale of cocaine and opium was outlawed. Cannabis was added to the list in 1920, in line with international treaties. For many years, in contrast to the US, the emphasis was on treatment rather than punishment. Heroin was prescribed to addicts on the NHS. But the climate changed in the 1960s, with the explosion in drug use among young people. The 1971 Misuse of Drugs Act, which categorises drugs by their perceived harm, remains the key piece of legislation. In 2002, the then Home Secretary, David Blunkett, downgraded cannabis to Class C, only for it to be reclassified as Class B by then Prime Minister Gordon Brown five years later. As a young Tory MP, David Cameron backed more lenient penalties for the possession of cannabis and ecstasy - and allowing heroin to be prescribed to addicts in ""shooting galleries"". He was a member of the Home Affairs Select Committee when it called for an international debate on the legalisation of drugs. Since entering Number 10, he has changed his view and now supports the current laws, in common with his Labour counterpart. Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg said last year that the ""war on drugs"" was lost and a review of all options was needed. In 1961 the world embarked on a US-led act of collective folly when it identified the non-medical use of specific drugs, including cannabis, cocaine and heroin, as a global threat and attempted to rid the world of them using punitive enforcement. After 50 years of global prohibition, drugs are cheaper, more available and widely used than ever before; a $300bn (Â£190bn) a year - and still growing - trade has been gifted to organised criminals and unregulated dealers - creating vast costs for those least able to bear them - undermining public health and human rights, fuelling crime, corruption and conflict, and destabilising entire regions. So, why has this war not been ended?  Why do politicians continue to support it?  The fundamental answer is disturbing. Prohibition clearly does not work for the vast majority of the world's citizens.  However, it meets the needs of the world's superpowers, who can resource and engage their military, police and criminal justice systems, all justified in the war against the global ""drug menace"". And at the same time it meets the needs of global financial markets who launder the billions in illicit profits.  As an example HSBC was recently fined $1.9bn for, among other things, laundering $881m of drug cartel money. To reorient policy in favour of ordinary people, the simple solution is to explore responsible legal regulation of drugs markets.  It is a position increasingly supported by Latin American presidents and indeed the US, where citizens in Washington State and Colorado recently voted to legally regulate cannabis markets. And what of the UK, where 67% of the population support a review of all drug policy options?  Despite his previous support for reform, since coming to power David Cameron has become a drug warrior, whilst [Labour leader] Ed Miliband appears to have deserted the most disadvantaged and marginalised by avoiding the drugs issue completely.  However, party leaders will shift if voters across the political spectrum prioritise it at election time. If not, senior politicians will remain in thrall to the US, and the UK will maintain its fervent support for a policy that serves the needs of the elite at the expense of the vast majority. It is easy to be dissatisfied with current drugs policies. Kids report they can get drugs relatively easily, and too many of us have suffered the heartbreak of addiction affecting a loved one or ourselves. The market for drugs is violent and deadly. But being unhappy with the drug abuse in society is no reason to legalise drugs. In fact, the best evidence we have shows that legalisation would make a bad drug problem much worse - by increasing addiction, normalising use among kids, and relegating its sale to profit-hungry corporations or governments with every incentive to increase addiction to advance their bottom line. Legalisation is a very sloppy way to address the unintended consequences of current policy. First, we know that legalisation would significantly cheapen the price of cocaine, cannabis, and heroin, making them more accessible and therefore increasing addiction. Additionally, allowing drugs to be sold on the open market implies we would allow the sale of highly dangerous drugs such as crack and methamphetamine by multinational conglomerates. Big Tobacco would have nothing on Big Meth. Second, it is unclear that a major attraction of legalisation - the supposed reduction of the violent, underground market - would materialise. As governments put restrictions like age limits on legal drugs, the illicit economy will be happy to step in to fill the gap. We know now that at least 22% of the UK domestic tobacco market consists of black market illegal cigarettes. Yes, mass incarceration is a bad thing. And the developing world is being torn apart by the UK's appetite for drugs. But rather than legalise - which would increase crime and potentially increase incarceration rates - we should invest more in strategies such as drug treatment, specialised drug treatment courts, better drug prevention, smart enforcement, and international partnerships that promote alternative development. The UK is moving in the right direction. By expanding treatment and recovery services over the past decade, drug use has fallen almost 15% between 2005 and 2011. But we still have more work to do. In the legalisation debate, misleading promises and silver bullets abound. Proceed with caution. Why not... privatise the NHS? Why not... nationalise the railways? Why not... introduce a flat tax?

"Home Secretary Sajid Javid has announced that specialist doctors in the UK will be able to legally prescribe cannabis-derived medicinal products. Cannabis is currently a controlled drug as classified by the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971. A follow-up to this law, the Misuse of Drugs Regulations Act 2001, placed it under Schedule 1, which is the category for substances with no medicinal value. And this is the schedule being considered by the review. Cannabis plants are made up of more than 100 different cannabinoids, which have different impacts on the body and are concentrated to different extents in certain parts of the plant. The most well-known of these are THC and CBD. THC is the psychoactive cannabinoid - the one that recreational users use to get ""high"". CBD does not have this effect. While almost all cannabinoids are controlled substances under the Misuse of Drugs Act, CBD - or cannabidiol as it is also known - is not. For example, industrial hemp may be grown under licence in the UK. It is a strain of the cannabis plant that contains little or no THC, but does contain CBD. The Home Office says that it can contain a maximum THC content of 0.2% and that the THC must not be easily separated from it. Industrial hemp can be used for things such as building materials and clothing. CBD oil can also be extracted from these plants and, as it is a legal cannabinoid, can be sold in the UK. The oil has been thought to have some medicinal properties, including relieving inflammation, pain relief and reducing anxiety, although there have not been conclusive scientific studies on this. In 2016, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) said that CBD products, if advertised for these medical purposes, needed to be licensed. Licences for CBD oil as a medicine have not been granted yet but the products can still be sold as long as claims are not made about their medical benefits. Holland and Barrett sells some CBD oils as food supplements. The oil that has been in the news recently due to its use by those with epilepsy is cannabis oil, which has a higher THC content, and so, unlike CBD oil, is not usually allowed in the UK. But Sativex, which is a 50-50 mix of THC and CBD produced in a lab, has been approved for use in the UK by the MHRA as a treatment for multiple sclerosis. However, in 2014, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, which issues guidance to NHS doctors, gave the medicine""do not recommend"" status,external, saying it was not cost-effective. Sativex is a spray. Each 10ml bottle contains 90 doses and costs about Â£140. Paul Hunt, from CBD product supplierVsavi,external, said:  ""This ruling by the Home Secretary is very welcome and we hope that this is just the start of changing opinions and legislation of CBD products by authorities in the UK.""

"Legalising cannabis could net the Treasury Â£1bn a year in tax revenue, a report backed by some MPs has claimed. The Adam Smith Institute, a free-market think tank, said the UK's policies had failed to stop the production and use of cannabis or the associated crime. Itsreport,externalsaid the UK should follow the lead of the US, wherefour further states legalised marijuanain this month's elections. The Home Office said it had no plans to legalise the ""harmful drug"". Former Deputy Prime Minster Nick Clegg and former health minister Norman Lamb are among a cross-party group of MPs that have backed the report. The Tide Effect, which was compiled with VolteFace, a drugs policy think tank, called for ""root and branch"" reform to legalise and regulate cannabis to ensure it meets acceptable standards and to remove the market for criminal gangs. It said a legal cannabis market could be worth Â£6.8bn to the economy annually, potentially raising between Â£750m and Â£1.05bn in tax revenues and reduced criminal justice costs. The number of offenders in prison for cannabis-related offences in England and Wales would also likely drop from the current 1,363, who cost taxpayers Â£50m a year, the report said. The Canadian government is preparing to decriminalise cannabis It comes as Germany is about to legalise cannabis for medical purposes while Canada prepares fordecriminalisation of the drug. The Netherlands effectively decriminalised cannabis decades ago while in 2001 Portugal changed the law to turn possession of drugs into an ""administrative offence"", sending those caught with drugs for personal use to a ""dissuasion board"" rather than face prosecution. Mr Clegg said: ""British politicians need to open their eyes to what is happening in the rest of the world. ""Cannabis prohibition is being swept away on a tide of popular opinion and replaced with responsible legal regulation. ""Now is the time for ministers to start writing the rules for this legal market, including age limits and health warnings, so that we can finally take back control from the criminal gangs."" Cannabis: Promise, risk and controversy The report said regulation was ""substantially more desirable"" than simply decriminalising the drug or unregulated legalisation. Regulation would remove gangs from the sale and production of the drug, ensure the product meets acceptable standards and raise money through taxation, it said. It also said a proportion of tax revenues from the sale of cannabis could be invested back into public services, particularly for those most vulnerable to the negative impacts of its use. Former deputy prime minister Nick Clegg called for ministers to ""take back control from the criminal gangs"" Report author Boris Starling said the advantages of a properly regulated cannabis market ""far outweigh the disadvantages"". He said attempts to control consumption through prohibition did not work and ""have not done so for many decades"". Mr Lamb said: ""Prohibition is harmful and counter-productive, helping neither to reduce drug use nor the risks to public health."" A Home Office spokeswoman said: ""This government has no plans to legalise cannabis. ""There is a substantial body of scientific and medical evidence to show that cannabis is a harmful drug which can damage people's mental and physical health. ""The UK's approach on drugs remains clear - we must prevent drug use in our communities and support people dependent on drugs through treatment and recovery.""

"Tesla chief executive Elon Musk has accused an employee of carrying out ""extensive and damaging sabotage"" at the electric carmaker. In an email to staff, Mr Musk said an unnamed employee made unspecified coding changes to its manufacturing operating system and sent sensitive data to unnamed third parties. The company did not comment and the allegations have not been verified. The matter will be investigated, Mr Musk said. ""The full extent of his actions are not yet clear, but what he has admitted so far is pretty bad,"" he said in the email. ""His stated motivation is that he wanted a promotion that he did not receive. ""As you know there are a long list of organisations that want Tesla to die,"" he added, citing Wall Street short-sellers, oil and gas companies and rival car makers as being among them. In a separate email to staff, Mr Musk said there had been a small fire at a Tesla factory on Sunday. It was quickly extinguished and did not cause any injuries or significant damage, he added. Firefighters were called in to extinguish the fire The factory fire followed a videotweeted by US actress Mary McCormackof a fire in a Tesla car driven by her husband, British TV director Michael Morris, in Los Angeles. Tesla said the car fire was an ""extraordinarily unusual occurrence"". Last week, Mr Musk said9% of Tesla's workforce would be cutas part of a restructuring of the carmaker, which has not made an annual profit since it was created nearly 15 years ago. After reporting a record quarterly loss of almost $710m in the first three months of the year, Mr Musk came in for criticism afterhe vetoed ""boring"" questions from analysts.

"The rapper's latest album debuted at the top of the Billboard 200 chart US rapper XXXTentacion, who quickly rose to fame with two consecutive hit albums, has been killed aged 20. He was leaving a motorcycle dealership in south Florida on Monday when a gunman shot him.

He was facing 15 felony charges at the time of his death, including aggravated battery of a pregnant woman. By Mark Savage, Music Reporter, BBC News XXXTentacion had a troubled upbringing and was expelled from middle school for fighting, but he channelled his energy and fury into music. He quickly became the most popular artist in the genre known as SoundCloud Rap, defined by its languid, hazy beats and wide-ranging influences.

"This video can not be played Violent husband kept wife virtual prisoner for 16 years A husband who regularly beat his wife and kept her locked indoors during their 16-year marriage has been jailed. Aziz Rehman, 47, would only allow partner Zeenit Bibi to leave their home in Collingbourne Avenue, Hodge Hill, Birmingham when on the school run. He would wedge twigs in the front door whenever he went out so he could tell if she had left the house. Rehman was sentenced at Birmingham Crown Court on Tuesday to three years and nine months in prison. Midlands Live: Mum 'appealed to PM' on cannabis; 'Wall collapse' death investigated A jury found the businessman guilty in May of assault and coercive control. Mrs Bibi, 36, who married Rehman in December 2000, told the BBC she wanted other victims to speak out. ""I didn't think anybody was going to believe me, which was one of the reasons that I left it so long, because in the outside world he made it look like we were the perfect family,"" she said. ""Nobody deserves this kind of life - talk about it, let somebody know. Aziz Rehman hit his wife on the head with a dumbbell ""I had dumbbells put on my head, I had a foldable chair hit on my knee, I wasn't walking properly. ""I wasn't allowed to go the doctor, I wasn't allowed to be in the hospital. ""My ribs were done in, my knees were done in, and I told people 'it's OK - I fell over the lawnmower'."" Judge Roderick Henderson told Rehmen - who owns Arden Superstore and off licence in Arden Road, Saltley - that he controlled his wife ""as property"". He said: ""People are entitled to a basic level of respect from partners, not to be assaulted, bullied and controlled."" 10% of young women 'face domestic abuse' 'He wasn't happy until he had me all to himself' Police train to spot coercive behaviour Rehman, who denied the charges, ran their home like a ""prison"". One regular visitor told police how the curtains were always drawn and described him as an ""oppressor"". Mrs Bibi alerted West Midlands Police in July 2016 while her husband was out of the country and he was arrested following his return to the UK. PC Maria Watts said Mrs Bibi was ""tormented throughout her marriage"". ""She was forbidden from seeing friends and family, regularly assaulted, denied access to a mobile phone, and was effectively living a life of domestic servitude,"" she said.

"Debenhams said full-year profits will be lower than expected - the third time it has issued a profit warning this year. The department store blamed ""increased competitor discounting and weakness in key markets"" for the profit shortfall. It said annual pre-tax profits would come in between Â£35m and Â£40m, below previous estimates of Â£50.3m. Debenhams' latest profit warning comes despite a turnaround plan designed to cut costs and boost sales. Chief executive Sergio Bucher pointed to ""exceptionally difficult times in UK retail"". Shares in Debenhamsfell as much as 16% in early trading before recovering slightly. Debenhams runs 182 stores in the UK, Republic of Ireland and in Denmark, where it operates under the Magasin du Nord name. By Emma Simpson, BBC business correspondent Debenhams is under pressure. The big question is whether it can deliver its turnaround plan quickly enough to adapt to the big structural changes in retail as well as a host of cost pressures. The retailer is caught between the need to bolster its finances but at the same time invest and revamp its stores. It's now cutting back on capital spending next year. Big department stores are expensive to run and require constant investment. Some will be wondering whether it will be able to spend what's really needed on its large number of stores to revive sales. The boss is promising real evidence of progress in the autumn. The race is on to show that the strategy is working and can deliver some much needed growth in the key Christmas season. Debenhams' latest warning adds to a chorus of recent woes on the UK High Street. House of Fraser, Marks & Spencer, New Look and Mothercare have all announced store closures this year. Competition from online retailers, higher import costs due to the weaker pound, a rise in business rates and squeezed household incomes have all combined to make times tough for High Street stores. Why we no longer love department stores Reality Check: Which shops are opening and closing? Six reasons behind the High Street crisis Debenhams said sales had fallen in May and June thanks to rivals' discounting and weak consumer spending. Like-for-like sales, which reflect sales at stores open for more than a year, fell by 1.7% in the 15 weeks to 16 June. Digital sales grew 16% over the same period. Mr Bucher who joined Debenhams in 2016, has launched a turnaround plan, putting more emphasis on food and beauty and improving the firm's online platform. However, in January the chain warned profits would be lower this year after a disappointing Christmas trading period. In April, the retailer warned that the cold weather in late February would eat further into profits. Nicholas Hyett, analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: ""Half a decade of falling sales and heavy discounting has trashed margins and left the group struggling to make ends meet. Unfortunately it all feels like Debenhams is playing catch-up with an industry that's left it behind."" There was more bad news for the retail sector as shares in sportswear retailer Footasylum nearly halved after it reported a slowdown in sales growth and said profits would be lower in the coming year. In its first results since floating on the stock market in November, revenues rose 33% to Â£194.8m in the year to 24 February with underlying profits up 4% at Â£8.4m. However, chief executive Clare Nesbitt said trading since the start of the new financial year had been affected by weak consumer confidence, meaning profits would show ""more modest growth"". Footasylum aims to more than double its 65 stores in the UK. Stockbroker Peel Hunt said there were also longer-term concerns over Footasylum, as major brands such as Nike and Adidas focus on selling directly to consumers and limiting the number of retailers they use: ""Footasylum may find that its access to the cool product files is restricted over time.""

"Aidan McAnespie was shot as he walked through a checkpoint A former soldier is to be charged with manslaughter by gross negligence over the 1988 killing of a Catholic man at an Army checkpoint. Aidan McAnespie, 23, was hit by one of three bullets fired from a machine gun in Aughnacloy, County Tyrone as he walked through the checkpoint. He was on his way to a Gaelic football match. David Jonathan Holden, 48, was informed of the intention to charge him on Tuesday morning via email. Army killing report 'cannot be released' Mr Holden, a former Grenadier Guardsman, was 18 at the time of the incident. It is believed he now lives in England. His first court appearance is expected to take place within the next three months. He was initially charged with manslaughter after the incident, but the charges were dropped in 1990. Prosecutors have reviewed that decision and informed Mr McAnespie's family. The family said, via their lawyers, that they welcomed the decision to prosecute. Mr McAnespie was walking through a border checkpoint when he was shot Mr McAnespie's family claimed he had been deliberately targeted after a sustained campaign of harassment by the Army. The soldier who fired the shots insisted he accidentally fired his gun because his fingers were wet. He was fined for negligent discharge of his weapon and medically discharged from the Army. A report by the Historical Enquiries Team a decade ago questioned his account of what happened. It said his explanation was the ""least likely"" version of events. The Public Prosecution Service reviewed the decision to drop the charges after the case was referred to it by Attorney General John Larkin. Mr McAnespie's funeral in 1988 He had been considering a request from Mr McAnespie's family for a new inquest into his death. A PPS spokesperson said the decision to charge came after ""careful consideration of all the evidence currently available in the case"". ""That evidence includes further expert evidence in relation to the circumstances in which the general purpose machine gun was discharged, thereby resulting in the ricochet shot which killed Mr McAnespie.""

"The government has said it will review the medicinal use of cannabis The government has said itwill review the use of medicinal cannabis, although recreational usage will still be illegal. Cannabis is the most widely-used illegal drug in Britain, according todrugs advice service Frank,external. It comes from the cannabis plant and contains tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), which affects the mind and mood. Cannabis comes from the cannabis plant The THC can give users a ""chilled out"" feeling but it can also cause hallucinations and make people feel paranoid and panicked. It is normally smoked but can also be eaten and comes in three main forms: Hash - a lump of resin Marijuana - the dried leaves and flowering parts of the female plant Oil - a thick honey-like substance Cannabis is aclass B drug,externalmeaning it it is illegal to possess. Anyone found with the drug could be imprisoned for up to five years while supplying it can be punished with a 14-year jail sentence or an unlimited fine. Supplying cannabis can lead to a 14-year jail term or unlimited fine The penalty depends on the amount of the drug, the person's criminal history and other aggravating or mitigating factors. Police can also issue a warning or an on-the-spot fine of Â£90 to someone found with cannabis. Alternatively, officers could issue a cannabis warning which goes on a person's record but is not revealed by a standard criminal records check. Of the 16,101 convictions for cannabis possession in the UK in 2016, 292 were jailed. The legality of recreational use is not up for debate, the government has said. Cannabis also contains cannabidiol (CBD) which scientists are investigating as a medical treatment. CBD-based treatments have shown some promising results for reducing seizures in children with severe epilepsies. Medical trials have largely focused on pharmacological preparations, but some parents of children with epilepsy have been buying oils containing CBD and THC. The mother of 12-year-old Billy Caldwell has reignited the debate about legalising the drug after saying it helps calm her son's seizures caused by severe epilepsy. Charlotte Caldwell, from County Tyrone, had been to Canada to buy her son cannabis oil but it was confiscated upon her return to the UK. The Home Office then returned the drug to Ms Caldwell and her son, who had been admitted to hospital,under a special 20-day licence. This video can not be played Cannabis oil row: Mother calls for drug to be legalised There is currently little scientific evidence on the safety and effectiveness of these oils as a treatment for epilepsy, although they do contain the same active ingredients. Meanwhile, Sativex, a cannabis-based spray, has been able to be legally prescribed since 2006. It is licensed to treat muscle stiffness and spasms in people with multiple sclerosis and although it is available throughout the UK, only in Wales can it be got for free on the NHS. Doctors could, in theory, prescribe it for other things outside of this licence, but at their own risk. Another licensed treatment is Nabilone. It contains an artificial version of THC and can be given to cancer patients to help relieve nausea during chemotherapy. Regular recreational cannabis use increases the risk of developing a psychotic illness, such as schizophrenia,according to the NHS,external. This risk is higher if it is used by teenagers and younger people as the drug interferes with development of the still-growing brain. Long-term use can also affect the ability to learn and concentrate. Recreational cannabis is often smoked Effects of using the drug can include a feeling of happiness and relaxation but it can also make users feel sick, faint and sleepy and cause memory loss. About 10% of regular users of cannabis become addicted to the drug, the NHS said. Withdrawal symptoms can include mood swings, restlessness and difficulty sleeping. In recent years, various stronger types of cannabis, grown for their higher concentration of the main active ingredient THC have invaded the street market. It's argued that cannabis with high levels of THC can lead to people developing psychiatric issues. According to the Royal College of Psychiatrists, there is sufficient evidence to show that people who use cannabis, particularly at a younger age, such as around the age of 15, have a higher than average risk of developing a psychotic illness, including schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. The two-part government review will be looking at how cannabis-based treatments will work. Firstly, it will make recommendations on which cannabis-based medicines might offer real medical and therapeutic benefits to patients. In the second part, the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs will consider whether changes should be made to the classification of these products after assessing ""the balance of harms and public health needs"". More than 25,000 peoplesigned a recent petition,externalcalling on the government to legalise cannabis for both recreational and medicinal uses. The petition's founders said banning the drug failed to reduce its use and it was ""hypocritical"" of the government to allow the sale of alcohol and tobacco but not cannabis. They also said selling the drug in licensed shops would limit the access of young people to cannabis and also regulate the THC level. The campaigners said cannabis has ""shown promise"" in reducing seizures and ""is far safer"" than other painkillers. It has also been argued that licensing and selling cannabiscould net up to Â£3.5bn for the government,external. Campaigners want cannabis legalised in the UK The government said fully-tested medicinal cannabis products can already be licensed for sale in the UK, such as Sativex, and it is open to further applications. Former Conservative leader Lord Hague has called for a ""decisive change"" in the law on cannabis saying ""any war"" against the drug had been ""irreversibly lost"". Writingin the Daily Telegraph,external, he said said the case of Billy Caldwell was an ""illuminating moment"" which revealed government policy to be ""inappropriate, ineffective and utterly out of date"". In response,the government said,externalit had ""no intention"" of reviewing cannabis' classification. It said: ""There is strong scientific and medical evidence that cannabis is a harmful drug which can be detrimental to people's mental and physical health."" It added that any debate about the medicinal benefits of cannabis-based medicines did not extend to illicit possession. Many other countries, including much of the US, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands, have legalised the use of medicinal cannabis. On Monday, Canada's House of Commonsvoted to legalise recreational cannabis.,external Uruguay legalised the recreational use of cannabis in 2013 with people allowed to grow up to six plants at home for personal use. In Spain, it is legal to use cannabis in private places and cultivate plants for personal use. Canada's House of Commons has just voted to legalise cannabis Cannabis use in the Netherlands is technically illegal but possession of up to 5g (0.2oz) for personal use is decriminalised, although police can confiscate the drug. Use is accepted at certain coffee shops. Recreational use is also decriminalised in several other countries, including Australia, Brazil, Colombia, Jamaica and Luxembourg.

"Cannabis addiction is rising among women Addiction to cannabis is rising among people above the age of 40, and women in particular, according to a study by the University of York. In the past 10 years, the number of women citing the drug as their sole concern at treatment centres more than doubled, from 471 to 1008. Researchers blame an increase in the potency of the drug and are calling for more and better treatment. Cannabis is still however primarily used by young men. The study analysed figures from Public Health England on people seeking help at drug treatment centres between 2005-06 and 2015-16. The increase comes despite fewer people using cannabis. The number of people who use it at least once a month has fallen from two million to 1.4 million during the past decade, according to the Crime Survey for England and Wales. It remains the most popular illegal recreational drug in the UK, however. This video can not be played What's behind the rise? Report author Ian Hamilton, a lecturer in addiction at York University, said: ""The narrative is that cannabis is a young person's problem. ""That is still the case, but we are seeing a steady and significant rise in addiction problems amongst people over 40, particularly women. ""Cannabis is cheap and widely available. And many women consider it to be benign. ""For many people it will be, but there are a significant number who go on to develop problems. ""Older people were probably used to cannabis at a lower strength. Now, the market is awash with higher potency stuff, often grown domestically. ""In some cases, resin can be nearly three times stronger than drugs on the street in 2005. ""Higher potency cannabis, which is often combined with tobacco, could increase the likelihood of people developing health problems."" Most UK cannabis super strength skunk The science behind super strength skunk Women often think cannabis is harmless Jayne and Emma, not their real names, are seeking treatment for cannabis addiction. Jayne toldBBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour programme: ""It was cheap. And I didn't have much money. ""I also thought it wouldn't cause consequences. There's the illusion that you can do everything you need to do as a mother. ""But as I used more and more of it, I found I couldn't go out and take my children to school. I really began to neglect them."" Emma told the programme: ""My husband was angry all the time and I felt I was walking on eggshells. My mum was physically abusive when I was younger, and that has always stayed with me. I guess it was easier to be out of it really."" Many people believed cannabis was not addictive, Mr Hamilton said. ""This is a myth. Yet not everyone will experience problems,"" he said. ""It's a bit like wine - some people can enjoy a glass, others become alcoholics. ""Yet as the strength of the product has increased, it's as if people are moving immediately to the strength-equivalent of a vodka."" Click to hear the full Woman's Hour discussion.

"Legalising cannabis could net the Treasury Â£1bn a year in tax revenue, a report backed by some MPs has claimed. The Adam Smith Institute, a free-market think tank, said the UK's policies had failed to stop the production and use of cannabis or the associated crime. Itsreport,externalsaid the UK should follow the lead of the US, wherefour further states legalised marijuanain this month's elections. The Home Office said it had no plans to legalise the ""harmful drug"". Former Deputy Prime Minster Nick Clegg and former health minister Norman Lamb are among a cross-party group of MPs that have backed the report. The Tide Effect, which was compiled with VolteFace, a drugs policy think tank, called for ""root and branch"" reform to legalise and regulate cannabis to ensure it meets acceptable standards and to remove the market for criminal gangs. It said a legal cannabis market could be worth Â£6.8bn to the economy annually, potentially raising between Â£750m and Â£1.05bn in tax revenues and reduced criminal justice costs. The number of offenders in prison for cannabis-related offences in England and Wales would also likely drop from the current 1,363, who cost taxpayers Â£50m a year, the report said. The Canadian government is preparing to decriminalise cannabis It comes as Germany is about to legalise cannabis for medical purposes while Canada prepares fordecriminalisation of the drug. The Netherlands effectively decriminalised cannabis decades ago while in 2001 Portugal changed the law to turn possession of drugs into an ""administrative offence"", sending those caught with drugs for personal use to a ""dissuasion board"" rather than face prosecution. Mr Clegg said: ""British politicians need to open their eyes to what is happening in the rest of the world. ""Cannabis prohibition is being swept away on a tide of popular opinion and replaced with responsible legal regulation. ""Now is the time for ministers to start writing the rules for this legal market, including age limits and health warnings, so that we can finally take back control from the criminal gangs."" Cannabis: Promise, risk and controversy The report said regulation was ""substantially more desirable"" than simply decriminalising the drug or unregulated legalisation. Regulation would remove gangs from the sale and production of the drug, ensure the product meets acceptable standards and raise money through taxation, it said. It also said a proportion of tax revenues from the sale of cannabis could be invested back into public services, particularly for those most vulnerable to the negative impacts of its use. Former deputy prime minister Nick Clegg called for ministers to ""take back control from the criminal gangs"" Report author Boris Starling said the advantages of a properly regulated cannabis market ""far outweigh the disadvantages"". He said attempts to control consumption through prohibition did not work and ""have not done so for many decades"". Mr Lamb said: ""Prohibition is harmful and counter-productive, helping neither to reduce drug use nor the risks to public health."" A Home Office spokeswoman said: ""This government has no plans to legalise cannabis. ""There is a substantial body of scientific and medical evidence to show that cannabis is a harmful drug which can damage people's mental and physical health. ""The UK's approach on drugs remains clear - we must prevent drug use in our communities and support people dependent on drugs through treatment and recovery.""

"This video can not be played Tom Inns: ""This building is not beyond saving - absolutely. It will be saved in some form."" The Glasgow School of Art ""will be saved"" after it was gutted in a massive blaze, according to its director. Construction experts have suggested the Mackintosh building could be so badly damaged, it would have to be torn down. But Prof Tom Inns told BBC Scotland that experts have carried out an initial survey and he confirmed the shell of the building is intact. ""This building is not beyond saving - absolutely"", he said. ""It will be saved in some form."" And he spoke of his conviction that the Mack should continue as a working art school, rather than a museum. In all its glory - The Mackintosh building before the fire Residents promised help after fire Demolition or restoration: What next for the Mack? The other building lost to the flames On Tuesday afternoon, Glasgow City Council's building control team said it had now taken control of the site and would ""significantly reduce"" the cordon. This means a number of businesses and residents will be allowed to return to their properties. Firefighters have been at the scene of the blaze, which also devastated the nearby O2 ABC music venue, for more than 72 hours. At its height, there were more than 120 firefighters involved in the operation. It is the second time in four years that the art school has been damaged in a major fire. The Mackintosh building was at the centre of a Â£35m restoration project when the blaze broke out on Friday night. Prof Inns told BBC Scotland that drones have been flown over the site to assess its condition and he was certain it could be rebuilt. Muriel Gray feared the worst when she watched fire engulf the Mackintosh building ""We have got very close to rebuilding it from the previous fire,"" he said. ""We have got a very experienced team now that understands this building intimately but rebuilding it is going to be a very, very complex process. ""We are going to have to stabilise the building, then we are going to have to think very, very carefully about what the strategy might be moving forward."" He added that he was hopeful that it would continue to be a base for creativity. ""In my mind, the Mackintosh building only works if it's got an art school inside it,"" he said. ""It has to have creative activity inside it to be the Mackintosh building. ""However the building comes back in its physical state, it has to have that creative activity inside it or it's not complete as a building."" This video can not be played Muriel Gray: Glasgow art school is going to come back Muriel Gray, the head of the board of governors, said that when she was told about the fire, she thought it must be a ""black joke"". ""But it's not a joke sadly, just dÃ©jÃ  vu,"" she said. The broadcaster told BBC Scotland that, as she watched the fire burn, she feared they would be left with a ""gap site"". ""But actually once again the Mack confounds us,"" she said. ""I think it's sending out a message it will not be defeated."" Despite the cordon around the affected buildings being reduced, council leader Susan Aitken said that as there remained a risk to public safety, a substantial exclusion zone would remain in place for the foreseeable future. Business advisors will be based in Sauchiehall Street to help traders affected. Ms Aitken said: ""Our building control team has now assumed responsibility for the site of the Mackintosh Building and the other affected properties. ""The cordon that was around these properties will be reduced, which will help many of the businesses and residents that were evacuated in the early hours of Saturday morning. ""However, a substantial cordon will remain for the foreseeable future, as the condition of these buildings is assessed - and I understand that will be a significant worry to those still unable to get access."" She added: ""This is a dynamic and complex situation; but we will work with residents and businesses to give them as much clarity as we can, when we can."" Earlier, in an interview onGood Morning Scotland, Ms Aitken said the local authority was focused on saving the historic landmark. She said initial superficial assessments had been carried out by officials, including building control officers. ""Certainly I think the consensus is that there is hope and and we are certainly not writing off the Mackintosh building yet,"" she said. ""Our intention, our focus will be to try and save that building and finding a future for it, but it's very early days."" One expert has suggested the cost of restoring the building after the latest fire could be more than Â£100m. When Ms Aitken was pressed on whether she was willing to back restoration at any cost, she replied: ""It's far too early to start talking about cost. ""We have seen lots of figures flying about but they are purely speculative. There's no one who's able to put a price on this at the moment."" Building expert Billy Hare compared the blaze to that which gutted the building housing Victoria's nightclub on Sauchiehall Street in March. The professor of construction management pointed out thatthe council very quickly took the decision to demolish that building. In Pictures: Glasgow School of Art fire How Glasgow became the Tinderbox City Timeline: The art school's devastating years But Ms Aitken said that decision was taken because it was unstable and in danger of ""imminent collapse"". ""That's not the case, we think, with the Mackintosh building at the moment,"" she said. ""Having said that, it is very early days. The initial assessments are that what remains of the building is largely structurally solid but it is really, really early days."" She said there was a consensus that the council should work with other organisations including the Scottish and UK governments to restore the building if it is possible. Meanwhile, traders on Sauchiehall Street have warned that the fire could spell the end for some businesses in the area. Donald MacLeod, the owner of the nearby Garage nightclub, said trade was already down as a result of roadworks connected to a planned regeneration of the area as part of theGlasgow City Deal. He said the fire was a ""hammer blow"" to dozens of local traders. ""They are bereft and looking for help,"" he said. Many have been closed since Saturday as they are inside a safety cordon put in place by the fire service. He said the roadworks had hit footfall and had a ""calamitous"" effect on some businesses, who fear the effect of the fire may be ""terminal"". A large section of Sauchiehall Street has been cordoned off since the fire broke out late on Friday night Ms Aitken will lead a meeting later with business representatives on the future of Sauchiehall Street in the wake of the fire. She said businesses inside the cordon set up by the fire service are being invited to apply for zero-rating on business rates. On Monday, fire investigators promised to find out what caused the blaze. Assistant Chief Officer David McGown said a ""comprehensive and professional"" probe will be carried out.

"Puan, 62, was given to Perth Zoo in 1968 The world's oldest known Sumatran orangutan has died in an Australian zoo aged 62, leaving behind 54 descendants. Puan, described as the ""grand old lady"" of Perth Zoo, was euthanised on Monday due to age-related complications. She had been at the zoo since 1968, and was officially recognised by Guinness World Records as the oldest of her species in 2016. A critically endangered species, Sumatran orangutans rarely reach age 50 in the wild, the zoo said. Believed to have been born in a jungle in Sumatra, Indonesia, in 1956, Puan left an ""incredible legacy"" of 11 children and a total of 54 descendants across the US, Europe and elsewhere, the zoo said. ""Her genetics count for just under 10% of the global zoological population,"" primate supervisor Holly Thompson said.

"Lord Hague said Billy Caldwell's case was an ""illuminating moment"" The government has rejected a call from Lord Hague to consider legalising the recreational use of cannabis. In an article forthe Daily Telegraph,,externalthe former Tory leader said the war on cannabis had been ""irreversibly lost"" and a change of policy was needed. His call was prompted by the case of a boy with epilepsy who was given a special licence to use cannabis oil. Home Secretary Sajid Javid has told MPsthere will be a review of the medical use of cannabisin the UK. The Home Office has set up an expert panel to review the rules on the therapeutic use of the drug, but a spokesman stressed that the existing laws on the recreational use of cannabis would not be changed. ""Any debate within government about the efficacy and therapeutic use of cannabis-based medicines emphatically does not extend to any review regarding the classification of cannabis and the penalties for the illicit possession, cultivation and trafficking of cannabis will remain the same."" Medicinal cannabis use to be reviewed Cannabis debate: What you need to know Why not... legalise drugs? Most UK cannabis 'super strength skunk' Cannabis is not recognised as having any therapeutic value under the law in England and Wales and anyone buying or using it can be arrested or jailed. One cannabis-based product - Sativex - can be legally prescribed in limited circumstances usually to help alleviate the symptoms of multiple sclerosis and the government is open to further applications. The parents of children with severe epilepsy are calling for cannabis-derived drugs to be made available to their offspring. Last week officials at Heathrow Airport confiscated Billy Caldwell's cannabis oil, which the 12-year-old's mother Charlotte had been attempting to bring into the UK from Canada. The Home Office returned some of the medicine after protests from Ms Caldwell, and assurances from the medical team treating Billy that the treatment was necessary. Billy was discharged from hospital on Monday, but will continue to be treated with the oil. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said it was obvious the government was not ""getting the law on this kind of thing right"" and suggested a review would take place ""as quickly as possible"". This video can not be played Hannah Deacon, whose son suffers from epilepsy, says she was given a promise by Theresa May It was ""nothing short of deluded"" to think cannabis can be driven off the streets, Lord Hague wrote Lord Hague said the debate about Billy Caldwell was ""one of those illuminating moments when a longstanding policy is revealed to be inappropriate, ineffective and utterly out of date"". By returning the medicine to the Caldwell family, the Home Office had ""implicitly conceded that the law has become indefensible"", he said. Licensing cannabis for medical use would be a ""step forward"", he said, but the Conservatives should be as ""bold"" as Canada where state-regulated recreational consumption was being considered. Others have said he is in danger of confusing two separate issues. Lord Hague is not the first politician to call for the legalisation of cannabis - but he is the most senior Conservative to do so. The party has traditionally taken a hard line on drugs, including when Lord Hague was its leader between 1997 and 2001. He now says it is ""deluded"" to think cannabis could be driven off the streets, adding that the ""battle is effectively over"". 'I want to produce the world's best cannabis' Legalising cannabis 'could raise Â£1bn' Cannabis: Promise, risk and controversy He said the fact that cannabis was both illegal and widely available effectively permitted ""the worst of all worlds"" to arise: encouraging more potent and dangerous variants of the drug, with users reluctant to seek help. He said the ""only beneficiaries"" of the current law were ""organised crime gangs"". Similar arguments have been made for decades by those campaigning for the liberalisation of drugs laws, with little impact on government. Many other countries, including much of the US, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands, have legalised the use of medicinal cannabis, but very few have legalised recreational use. Prime Minister Theresa May remains firmly opposed to legalisation or decriminalisation of the drug because of the harm she says it does to individual users and communities. Legalisation of cannabis could see it being sold in shops or by licensed distributors, in the same way as alcohol or tobacco. This differs from decriminalisation, under which possession of the drug is no longer a criminal offence, but sales are still prohibited. The UK downgraded cannabis to a Class C drug in 2002 - putting it in the same category as steroids - with possession of small quantities no longer an arrestable offence. But it was moved back up to Class B by then Prime Minister Gordon Brown in 2008, with penalties for possession of up to five years in prison. Supplying attracts a sentence of up to 14 years imprisonment and an unlimited fine. According to Home Office statistics, cannabis was the most commonly used drug in the UK in 2016-17, with 6.6% of adults aged 16 to 59 having used it. That's about 2.2 million people. Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable said his party supported the legal sale of cannabis for recreational use provided it was ""properly regulated"" and sold by ""legalised distributors"", which he said ""would reduce the harm caused by ""potent and damaging forms"" of the drug. He claimed legalisation would not lead to greater consumption, telling BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""If it was carefully regulated and heavily taxed there wouldn't be any incentive to use it."" Boy discharged after getting cannabis oil Reality Check: Does UK export the most legal cannabis? 'Law not right' on medical cannabis use The Green Party is also in favour of legalisation of cannabis, arguing it would ""reduce the harm associated with it"". Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has said he would decriminalise cannabis for medicinal purposes. But a Labour government would ""look at the medical effects on the wider community and on cannabis users"" before deciding whether to back legalisation for recreational use, he added. Conservative MP Crispin Blunt, chairman of an all-party Parliamentary Group on drugs reform, said Lord Hague was ""absolutely right"" and the current laws had failed, adding that selling cannabis legally would generate substantial tax revenues. The majority of assembly members in Wales, the SNP and all parties in Northern Ireland except the DUP have backed medical legalisation of cannabis. The Royal College of Nursing also voted overwhelmingly in favour of lobbying the government to make it legal for medical use last month. The Royal College of Psychiatrists says legalisation for recreational and medicinal use should be considered as distinct. It says cannabis carries significant mental health risks but it supports the medicinal use of approved cannabis products. Campaigners against legalisation argue that it would normalise the use of drugs among children and lead to greater addiction and health problems. Conservative MP Laurence Robertson warned it could lead to cannabis being sold in shops ""alongside Mars bars and cans of coke"" and that it would not kill off the ""illicit"" trade in the drug, saying taxing cigarettes had led to a booming black market. Prime Minister Theresa May last year vowed to continue the ""war on drugs,"" saying ""the incredible damage [drugs] can do to families and the individuals concerned"".

"This video can not be played Tom Inns: ""This building is not beyond saving - absolutely. It will be saved in some form."" The Glasgow School of Art ""will be saved"" after it was gutted in a massive blaze, according to its director. Construction experts have suggested the Mackintosh building could be so badly damaged, it would have to be torn down. But Prof Tom Inns told BBC Scotland that experts have carried out an initial survey and he confirmed the shell of the building is intact. ""This building is not beyond saving - absolutely"", he said. ""It will be saved in some form."" And he spoke of his conviction that the Mack should continue as a working art school, rather than a museum. In all its glory - The Mackintosh building before the fire Residents promised help after fire Demolition or restoration: What next for the Mack? The other building lost to the flames On Tuesday afternoon, Glasgow City Council's building control team said it had now taken control of the site and would ""significantly reduce"" the cordon. This means a number of businesses and residents will be allowed to return to their properties. Firefighters have been at the scene of the blaze, which also devastated the nearby O2 ABC music venue, for more than 72 hours. At its height, there were more than 120 firefighters involved in the operation. It is the second time in four years that the art school has been damaged in a major fire. The Mackintosh building was at the centre of a Â£35m restoration project when the blaze broke out on Friday night. Prof Inns told BBC Scotland that drones have been flown over the site to assess its condition and he was certain it could be rebuilt. Muriel Gray feared the worst when she watched fire engulf the Mackintosh building ""We have got very close to rebuilding it from the previous fire,"" he said. ""We have got a very experienced team now that understands this building intimately but rebuilding it is going to be a very, very complex process. ""We are going to have to stabilise the building, then we are going to have to think very, very carefully about what the strategy might be moving forward."" He added that he was hopeful that it would continue to be a base for creativity. ""In my mind, the Mackintosh building only works if it's got an art school inside it,"" he said. ""It has to have creative activity inside it to be the Mackintosh building. ""However the building comes back in its physical state, it has to have that creative activity inside it or it's not complete as a building."" This video can not be played Muriel Gray: Glasgow art school is going to come back Muriel Gray, the head of the board of governors, said that when she was told about the fire, she thought it must be a ""black joke"". ""But it's not a joke sadly, just dÃ©jÃ  vu,"" she said. The broadcaster told BBC Scotland that, as she watched the fire burn, she feared they would be left with a ""gap site"". ""But actually once again the Mack confounds us,"" she said. ""I think it's sending out a message it will not be defeated."" Despite the cordon around the affected buildings being reduced, council leader Susan Aitken said that as there remained a risk to public safety, a substantial exclusion zone would remain in place for the foreseeable future. Business advisors will be based in Sauchiehall Street to help traders affected. Ms Aitken said: ""Our building control team has now assumed responsibility for the site of the Mackintosh Building and the other affected properties. ""The cordon that was around these properties will be reduced, which will help many of the businesses and residents that were evacuated in the early hours of Saturday morning. ""However, a substantial cordon will remain for the foreseeable future, as the condition of these buildings is assessed - and I understand that will be a significant worry to those still unable to get access."" She added: ""This is a dynamic and complex situation; but we will work with residents and businesses to give them as much clarity as we can, when we can."" Earlier, in an interview onGood Morning Scotland, Ms Aitken said the local authority was focused on saving the historic landmark. She said initial superficial assessments had been carried out by officials, including building control officers. ""Certainly I think the consensus is that there is hope and and we are certainly not writing off the Mackintosh building yet,"" she said. ""Our intention, our focus will be to try and save that building and finding a future for it, but it's very early days."" One expert has suggested the cost of restoring the building after the latest fire could be more than Â£100m. When Ms Aitken was pressed on whether she was willing to back restoration at any cost, she replied: ""It's far too early to start talking about cost. ""We have seen lots of figures flying about but they are purely speculative. There's no one who's able to put a price on this at the moment."" Building expert Billy Hare compared the blaze to that which gutted the building housing Victoria's nightclub on Sauchiehall Street in March. The professor of construction management pointed out thatthe council very quickly took the decision to demolish that building. In Pictures: Glasgow School of Art fire How Glasgow became the Tinderbox City Timeline: The art school's devastating years But Ms Aitken said that decision was taken because it was unstable and in danger of ""imminent collapse"". ""That's not the case, we think, with the Mackintosh building at the moment,"" she said. ""Having said that, it is very early days. The initial assessments are that what remains of the building is largely structurally solid but it is really, really early days."" She said there was a consensus that the council should work with other organisations including the Scottish and UK governments to restore the building if it is possible. Meanwhile, traders on Sauchiehall Street have warned that the fire could spell the end for some businesses in the area. Donald MacLeod, the owner of the nearby Garage nightclub, said trade was already down as a result of roadworks connected to a planned regeneration of the area as part of theGlasgow City Deal. He said the fire was a ""hammer blow"" to dozens of local traders. ""They are bereft and looking for help,"" he said. Many have been closed since Saturday as they are inside a safety cordon put in place by the fire service. He said the roadworks had hit footfall and had a ""calamitous"" effect on some businesses, who fear the effect of the fire may be ""terminal"". A large section of Sauchiehall Street has been cordoned off since the fire broke out late on Friday night Ms Aitken will lead a meeting later with business representatives on the future of Sauchiehall Street in the wake of the fire. She said businesses inside the cordon set up by the fire service are being invited to apply for zero-rating on business rates. On Monday, fire investigators promised to find out what caused the blaze. Assistant Chief Officer David McGown said a ""comprehensive and professional"" probe will be carried out.

"This video can not be played The sound of migrant children separated from parents An audio recording in which migrant children in the US can be heard crying for their parents has been released as US President Donald Trump remains defiant over his immigration policy. Some 2,000 migrant children have been separated from their parents in the past few months after their families tried to cross the US border illegally. Mr Trump said he would not allow the US to become a ""migrant camp"". The UN high commissioner for refugees says the policy is ""unacceptable"". The recording was released by investigative US media outlet ProPublica on Monday, and was said to have been made from inside a US customs and border protection facility. Why the US is separating migrant children from their parents Who made the decision? Cages of fencing hold migrant children In it, several Central American children separated from their parents and thought to be aged between four and 10 can be heard sobbing and wailing, and calling for their mother or father. One border patrol agent can be heard saying: ""We have an orchestra here. What's missing is a conductor."" The UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Filippo Grandi, has told the BBC the Trump administration's ""zero-tolerance"" policy towards illegal immigration is unacceptable. ""It is absolutely wrong to separate children from their families in any circumstances and particularly when people are in distress as, for example, people that are fleeing from violence and persecution, as is the case for people in Central America,"" he said. ""So, we are advising the government of the United States that this is not the right way to handle that particular phenomenon of people seeking asylum across the border."" This video can not be played US child migrants: Five things to know On Monday, Mr Trump said the US would ""not be a migrant camp"", or a refugee-holding facility. ""You look at what's happening in Europe, you look at what's happening in other places. ""We cannot allow that to happen to the United States. Not on my watch."" The Republican president blamed Democrats for not coming to the table to negotiate immigration legislation. Meanwhile, Mr Trump's job approval rating averaged 45%,according to Gallup polling conducted last week,external. This matches his previous peak, in the first week after his inauguration in January 2016. Official images of the tent city for migrant children in Tornillo, Texas, were released on Monday Nearly 2,000 children have been separated from their parents at the border between mid-April and the end of May. The administration's ""zero-tolerance"" policy entails criminally charging those entering the US illegally, including asylum seekers. This has led to parents being separated from their children, who are not charged with a crime. As a result, hundreds of children are being housed in detention centres, including warehouses and converted supermarkets. Images from some of the border camps show children being held in caged areas separated by chain-link fencing. This video can not be played Migrant boys detained in a former Walmart in Texas Some shelters and foster homes have said they are running out of space. Officials have also announced plans to erect tent cities that will hold hundreds more children in the Texas desert where temperatures regularly reach 40C (105F). Democrats and some in Mr Trump's own Republican Party have strongly condemned the administration. The crackdown has even provoked fierce criticism from the president's wife, Melania Trump, who said over the weekend she ""hates to see children separated from families"". Former First Lady Laura Bush meanwhile wrote in a Washington Post op-ed that the tactics were ""immoral"" and evoked Japanese-American internment camps during the Second World War.

Former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton said Mr Trump's widely debunked claims that the family separations were mandated by law was ""an outright lie"". Most congressional Republicans, however, have declined to criticise Mr Trump over the policy. On Monday, US Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen defended the ""zero-tolerance"" policy, arguing that the government was simply following the law and it would be up to Congress to change it. During a heated briefing at the White House, Ms Nielsen also insisted that migrants who attempt to cross the US border were putting their children in an unsafe situation. Fox News host Laura Ingraham called the detention centres ""essentially summer camps"", and praised Mr Trump for ""doing what we should have been doing all along, prosecuting all border crashers"". Conservative author Ann Coulter called the children ""child actors weeping and crying"" on TV networks. ""Do not fall for it, Mr President,"" she warned in an interview on Fox News.

"Universities in the UK should stop using predicted grades when people are applying for places, say lecturers and head teachers. A study from the University and College Union says no other developed country uses such a system of forecasts of results for university admissions. The lecturers say most predicted grades turn out to be incorrect. Head teachers have backed calls for a change, saying the current approach is ""no longer fit for purpose"". A study from the UCU lecturers' union has examined admissions systems from 30 major countries and found no others using the UK's approach of pupils applying on the basis of grades predicted by their teachers. The UCU also cites research from 2016 suggesting as few as16% of predictions for three A-levels or equivalent had proved accurate. Ucas, which operates the admissions system, says the most recent figures suggest predicted grades are usually higher than the actual results - with 73% of applicants performing less well than forecast by their teachers. There are calls for students to make university applications based on results rather than predicted grades The report from lecturers calls for an ""urgent overhaul"" of the application system, so that pupils would know their actual exam grades before making their final applications. ""We are alone in the world in using a system where students are offered university places based on highly inaccurate predicted grades,"" said UCU leader Sally Hunt. The calls for a review of the application system - and ditching the reliance on predicted grades - was backed by the ASCL head teachers' union. ""Out of date and no longer fit for purpose, it is a historical quirk which is not mirrored in other countries and creates unnecessary problems,"" said Malcolm Trobe, the ASCL's deputy general secretary. He said that there might be practical challenges - such as the timetable for applications - ""but we do not believe these are insurmountable"". Under the Labour government in 2004, a review recommended a change so that pupils had their results before applying - on the grounds that it would be fairer for disadvantaged applicants. Ministers backed the change, but the proposals were never implemented. The idea was put forward again in 2012 - and once more were not adopted. Universities UK says the position remained that there were ""continuing practical obstacles"". Clare Marchant, head of Ucas, has spoken against changing the applications timetable. She said it would mean ""structural change to either the secondary or higher education systems"". And she warned it would be harder for poorer pupils who would have to make decisions after they had finished their exams and left school. ""It was felt that students from disadvantaged backgrounds would be less likely to have access to teachers and support in making application choices,"" said Ms Marchant. The Sutton Trust social mobility charity has said the opposite - with a report saying the current systemworks against talented, disadvantaged youngsters. Mr Trobe also warned about the rise in unconditional offers to university applicants - in which universities say they will admit a student regardless of their exam results. ""This practice can demotivate students and lead to underperformance in these important qualifications, which disadvantages them if prospective future employers take their A-level grades into account,"" he said.

"Aidan McAnespie was shot as he walked through a checkpoint A former soldier is to be charged with manslaughter by gross negligence over the 1988 killing of a Catholic man at an Army checkpoint. Aidan McAnespie, 23, was hit by one of three bullets fired from a machine gun in Aughnacloy, County Tyrone as he walked through the checkpoint. He was on his way to a Gaelic football match. David Jonathan Holden, 48, was informed of the intention to charge him on Tuesday morning via email. Army killing report 'cannot be released' Mr Holden, a former Grenadier Guardsman, was 18 at the time of the incident. It is believed he now lives in England. His first court appearance is expected to take place within the next three months. He was initially charged with manslaughter after the incident, but the charges were dropped in 1990. Prosecutors have reviewed that decision and informed Mr McAnespie's family. The family said, via their lawyers, that they welcomed the decision to prosecute. Mr McAnespie was walking through a border checkpoint when he was shot Mr McAnespie's family claimed he had been deliberately targeted after a sustained campaign of harassment by the Army. The soldier who fired the shots insisted he accidentally fired his gun because his fingers were wet. He was fined for negligent discharge of his weapon and medically discharged from the Army. A report by the Historical Enquiries Team a decade ago questioned his account of what happened. It said his explanation was the ""least likely"" version of events. The Public Prosecution Service reviewed the decision to drop the charges after the case was referred to it by Attorney General John Larkin. Mr McAnespie's funeral in 1988 He had been considering a request from Mr McAnespie's family for a new inquest into his death. A PPS spokesperson said the decision to charge came after ""careful consideration of all the evidence currently available in the case"". ""That evidence includes further expert evidence in relation to the circumstances in which the general purpose machine gun was discharged, thereby resulting in the ricochet shot which killed Mr McAnespie.""

"Energy giant E.On has said its standard tariff prices will rise by an average of 4.8% for those customers who take both gas and electricity. Customers will face an average annual price rise of Â£55 from 16 August. ""A number of costs have risen quite sharply and we've experienced a hike in the price we have to pay for the energy our customers need,"" E.On said. In March, the company made changes to its bills which added Â£22 to its average standard variable tariff rate. An E.On spokeswoman told the BBC: ""Those changes led to the removal of discounts and a change to the standing charge for people who pay on demand by cash or cheque. ""This is an increase in unit price, which makes us the fourth cheapest of the big six suppliers."" How to switch energy supplier Move to cap 'rip-off' energy bills For E.On's electricity-only customers the standard variable rate will rise by 6.2%, an average of Â£36 a year, while gas-only customers will see a 3.3% increase, an average of Â£19. She added that the company had been hit by a 22% increase in wholesale costs since March. The rest of the big six have all announced prices rises recently. SSE bills rose an average 6.78% or Â£76 a year British Gas bills went up by 5.5% or Â£60 Scottish Power's increase was 5.5% or Â£63 on average EDF raised electricity prices by 2.7% or Â£16 Npower's 5.3% increase, an average of Â£64, came into effect at the weekend. In a statement, E.On said it was its second unit price increase in more than four-and-a-half years, and during this period it had also cut prices on two occasions. E.On chief executive Michael Lewis said: ""We'll continue proactively to tell customers about the different tariffs on offer and encourage them to move to those tariffs, as well as promoting the different services that can potentially help bring their bills down such as a smart meter, a more efficient boiler or better insulation."" Victoria Arrington, from price comparison service Energyhelpline, said: ""This new rise is a bitter and expensive pill to swallow.

"Sumir Mahatma said there was ""chaos"" at Bolton station because of the delays Passengers on Northern rail trains have been hit by more disruption after staff walked out in a fresh strike in a long-running dispute over guards. Members of the Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union are staging a 24-hour stoppage, with further walkouts planned for Thursday and Saturday. The company said it would run as many services as possible until 19:00 BST. Customers have reacted angrily to delays and overcrowding with the strike action also being questioned. The union claims imposing driver-only services is a risk to public safety. Regional director for Northern, Sharon Keith, said: ""On each day of the strike action we will be running fewer services and expect those services we do operate to be extremely busy. ""It is, therefore, vital that anyone thinking of travelling with Northern on Tuesday, Thursday or Saturday plans their journey carefully."" Workers strike again in train safety row Rail strike go ahead as talks fail Although 2017 saw fewer strikes on average than in the years between 2011 and 2014, it was the biggest year for workers in the transport and storage sector since 2009. According to the Office for National Statistics, 276,400 working days were lost due to industrial action, of which 187,000 were down to the transport and storage sector. The ONS said 15,100 workers in these industries were involved in 27 stoppages. That compares with 60,200 working days lost in 2015 in 19 stoppages, even though more workers went on strike. The last year in the past decade where there was so much disruption was in 2009. This was a year that saw strikes by Royal Mail workers, who came under the same category for statistical recording, as well as strikes on the London Underground. Sumir Mahatma said there was hundreds of people waiting to get on to one train into Manchester at Bolton station after others had been cancelled, and he ended up late for work. On Twitter, @MCStu1962 said that he no longer had sympathy for the RMT. He said: ""The strikes clearly aren't working because you are only hurting ordinary people yet you keep on doing it."" Strikers also stood together at a picket line in Skipton, North Yorkshire Meanwhile, others were surprised Northern had not backed down in the talks, with @stemcqueenie said ""you would think they would cancel the strikes amid all the timetable chaos"". @GTR_Warwick said there were ""extra carriages and better service"" on a strike day, while @beccimoorby said she felt sorry for the ""poor staff"" and that the company was ""a shambles"".

"Morgan and Reid have been co-presenting on ITV since 2015 Good Morning Britain presenter Susanna Reid has revealed she feels she wages ""a constant battle for airtime"" with her outspoken co-host Piers Morgan. ""Sometimes I open my mouth to ask a question and hear Piers's voice come out,"" she told the Radio Times. ""You can't help but go into battle with him every morning,"" continued Reid, who quit the BBC for ITV in 2014. Morgan and Reid have proved a winning partnership for ITV, but its morning show still trails behind BBC Breakfast. BBC One's breakfast programme has an average daily audience of 1.5 million, around twice the audience who tune into its commercial rival. Reid previously presented BBC Breakfast alongside Bill Turnbull and others Former tabloid editor Morgan joined Good Morning Britain in 2015 with the stated aim of making the show ""unpredictable, provocative [and] lively"". ""I just took a view that the way to make us truly competitive was to shake things up a bit,""he told the BBC last year. Speaking to the Radio Times, Reid admitted that her first reaction to his hiring was ""Arghhh!"" and that sharing the sofa with him was akin to ""sitting next to a hedgehog"". Reid said she struggled with their relationship up until last year, and admits to frequently coming off air in tears. What brought things to a head were the Women's Marches of 2017, of which Morgan was highly critical. Piers Morgan: Breaking the breakfast TV rules Good Morning Britain tops 2017 Ofcom complaints She says what upset her most were the attacks she received from men who accused her of ""enabling his anti-feminist views"". ""The man sitting next to me was spouting off whatever he believes, which I don't agree with... but I had men telling me it was my fault he was saying this. And I was just like, I've had enough of men telling me how I should be a feminist. I've had enough of it."" Reid told the magazine it was then that she realised it wasn't her responsibility to ""pick up the pieces"" after Morgan provoked controversy. Reid made it to the final of Strictly Come Dancing in 2013 She also claims she is ""very happy"" with her current salary and that she does not know how it compares with her co-host's,said to be around Â£1.1 million a year,external. Reid previously presented BBC Breakfast and was a runner-up on Strictly Come Dancing in 2013. Speaking about comparisons between Good Morning Britain and BBC Breakfast, she said: ""I'm quite nervous about conflict, I don't like it. ""[Morgan] loves it, he relishes it. He's actually very good friends with [BBC Breakfast presenter] Dan Walker, which I think a lot of people don't realise - because you see, for Piers, conflict is never personal."" She added: ""I'm not looking at beating the BBC. There are people who want its presenting style in the morning. ""There's something very reassuring, and very likeable about it. No-one's ever going to be offended by Dan and Louise [Minchin]. I know them personally, and they're blinking lovely. You couldn't describe Piers as lovable. ""And I don't think everybody necessarily wants a double espresso shot into their veins in the morning. Some people want a nice cup of tea. And there is absolutely a role for both.""

"Tesla chief executive Elon Musk has accused an employee of carrying out ""extensive and damaging sabotage"" at the electric carmaker. In an email to staff, Mr Musk said an unnamed employee made unspecified coding changes to its manufacturing operating system and sent sensitive data to unnamed third parties. The company did not comment and the allegations have not been verified. The matter will be investigated, Mr Musk said. ""The full extent of his actions are not yet clear, but what he has admitted so far is pretty bad,"" he said in the email. ""His stated motivation is that he wanted a promotion that he did not receive. ""As you know there are a long list of organisations that want Tesla to die,"" he added, citing Wall Street short-sellers, oil and gas companies and rival car makers as being among them. In a separate email to staff, Mr Musk said there had been a small fire at a Tesla factory on Sunday. It was quickly extinguished and did not cause any injuries or significant damage, he added. Firefighters were called in to extinguish the fire The factory fire followed a videotweeted by US actress Mary McCormackof a fire in a Tesla car driven by her husband, British TV director Michael Morris, in Los Angeles. Tesla said the car fire was an ""extraordinarily unusual occurrence"". Last week, Mr Musk said9% of Tesla's workforce would be cutas part of a restructuring of the carmaker, which has not made an annual profit since it was created nearly 15 years ago. After reporting a record quarterly loss of almost $710m in the first three months of the year, Mr Musk came in for criticism afterhe vetoed ""boring"" questions from analysts.

"This video can not be played Tom Inns: ""This building is not beyond saving - absolutely. It will be saved in some form."" The Glasgow School of Art ""will be saved"" after it was gutted in a massive blaze, according to its director. Construction experts have suggested the Mackintosh building could be so badly damaged, it would have to be torn down. But Prof Tom Inns told BBC Scotland that experts have carried out an initial survey and he confirmed the shell of the building is intact. ""This building is not beyond saving - absolutely"", he said. ""It will be saved in some form."" And he spoke of his conviction that the Mack should continue as a working art school, rather than a museum. In all its glory - The Mackintosh building before the fire Residents promised help after fire Demolition or restoration: What next for the Mack? The other building lost to the flames On Tuesday afternoon, Glasgow City Council's building control team said it had now taken control of the site and would ""significantly reduce"" the cordon. This means a number of businesses and residents will be allowed to return to their properties. Firefighters have been at the scene of the blaze, which also devastated the nearby O2 ABC music venue, for more than 72 hours. At its height, there were more than 120 firefighters involved in the operation. It is the second time in four years that the art school has been damaged in a major fire. The Mackintosh building was at the centre of a Â£35m restoration project when the blaze broke out on Friday night. Prof Inns told BBC Scotland that drones have been flown over the site to assess its condition and he was certain it could be rebuilt. Muriel Gray feared the worst when she watched fire engulf the Mackintosh building ""We have got very close to rebuilding it from the previous fire,"" he said. ""We have got a very experienced team now that understands this building intimately but rebuilding it is going to be a very, very complex process. ""We are going to have to stabilise the building, then we are going to have to think very, very carefully about what the strategy might be moving forward."" He added that he was hopeful that it would continue to be a base for creativity. ""In my mind, the Mackintosh building only works if it's got an art school inside it,"" he said. ""It has to have creative activity inside it to be the Mackintosh building. ""However the building comes back in its physical state, it has to have that creative activity inside it or it's not complete as a building."" This video can not be played Muriel Gray: Glasgow art school is going to come back Muriel Gray, the head of the board of governors, said that when she was told about the fire, she thought it must be a ""black joke"". ""But it's not a joke sadly, just dÃ©jÃ  vu,"" she said. The broadcaster told BBC Scotland that, as she watched the fire burn, she feared they would be left with a ""gap site"". ""But actually once again the Mack confounds us,"" she said. ""I think it's sending out a message it will not be defeated."" Despite the cordon around the affected buildings being reduced, council leader Susan Aitken said that as there remained a risk to public safety, a substantial exclusion zone would remain in place for the foreseeable future. Business advisors will be based in Sauchiehall Street to help traders affected. Ms Aitken said: ""Our building control team has now assumed responsibility for the site of the Mackintosh Building and the other affected properties. ""The cordon that was around these properties will be reduced, which will help many of the businesses and residents that were evacuated in the early hours of Saturday morning. ""However, a substantial cordon will remain for the foreseeable future, as the condition of these buildings is assessed - and I understand that will be a significant worry to those still unable to get access."" She added: ""This is a dynamic and complex situation; but we will work with residents and businesses to give them as much clarity as we can, when we can."" Earlier, in an interview onGood Morning Scotland, Ms Aitken said the local authority was focused on saving the historic landmark. She said initial superficial assessments had been carried out by officials, including building control officers. ""Certainly I think the consensus is that there is hope and and we are certainly not writing off the Mackintosh building yet,"" she said. ""Our intention, our focus will be to try and save that building and finding a future for it, but it's very early days."" One expert has suggested the cost of restoring the building after the latest fire could be more than Â£100m. When Ms Aitken was pressed on whether she was willing to back restoration at any cost, she replied: ""It's far too early to start talking about cost. ""We have seen lots of figures flying about but they are purely speculative. There's no one who's able to put a price on this at the moment."" Building expert Billy Hare compared the blaze to that which gutted the building housing Victoria's nightclub on Sauchiehall Street in March. The professor of construction management pointed out thatthe council very quickly took the decision to demolish that building. In Pictures: Glasgow School of Art fire How Glasgow became the Tinderbox City Timeline: The art school's devastating years But Ms Aitken said that decision was taken because it was unstable and in danger of ""imminent collapse"". ""That's not the case, we think, with the Mackintosh building at the moment,"" she said. ""Having said that, it is very early days. The initial assessments are that what remains of the building is largely structurally solid but it is really, really early days."" She said there was a consensus that the council should work with other organisations including the Scottish and UK governments to restore the building if it is possible. Meanwhile, traders on Sauchiehall Street have warned that the fire could spell the end for some businesses in the area. Donald MacLeod, the owner of the nearby Garage nightclub, said trade was already down as a result of roadworks connected to a planned regeneration of the area as part of theGlasgow City Deal. He said the fire was a ""hammer blow"" to dozens of local traders. ""They are bereft and looking for help,"" he said. Many have been closed since Saturday as they are inside a safety cordon put in place by the fire service. He said the roadworks had hit footfall and had a ""calamitous"" effect on some businesses, who fear the effect of the fire may be ""terminal"". A large section of Sauchiehall Street has been cordoned off since the fire broke out late on Friday night Ms Aitken will lead a meeting later with business representatives on the future of Sauchiehall Street in the wake of the fire. She said businesses inside the cordon set up by the fire service are being invited to apply for zero-rating on business rates. On Monday, fire investigators promised to find out what caused the blaze. Assistant Chief Officer David McGown said a ""comprehensive and professional"" probe will be carried out.

"The singer previously starred in films including Precious, The Butler and The Hunger Games Rock star Lenny Kravitz says he lost a role on the TV show Big Little Lies because producers felt uneasy about casting a black actor as a villain. The star was ""considered to play one of the husbands"" in the drama, which revolves around three emotionally troubled women in suburban California. Big Little Lies was one of the most critically-lauded dramas of 2017,  with an all-star cast including Reese Witherspoon, Nicole Kidman and Laura Dern. Had he won the role, Kravitz would have been ""the only black man on the show,"" he told the BBC. ""And the word that came back to me was that, if I was the only black man on the show, they didn't want me doing what it was that I would be doing. ""So that ended up not happening,"" Kravitz added. ""The director [Jean-Marc VallÃ©e] was like, 'I so want you for this but we'll work together another time.'"" Kravitz declined to specify which role he was up for (""I can't really say"") - but it seems likely he was referring to Perry Wright, who is seen subjecting his wife Celeste to vicious beatings and psychological torture throughout the HBO series. The part eventually went to Alexander SkarsgÃ¥rd, who won both an Emmy and a Golden Globe for his performance. The BBC contacted HBO for a response to Kravitz's story, but was told that ""producers are deep into production on the second season for Big Little Lies and are unavailable for comment"". Alexander Skarsgard and Nicole Kidman won multiple awards for their harrowing portrayal of domestic violence A second series of Big Little Lies is already in production with Meryl Streep expected to join the cast. Adapted from the Liane Moriarty novel of the same name, it touched a nerve with viewers in dealing with divorce, domestic violence, the troubles of raising children, school bullying, and ageing. Kravitz, who previously starred in films like Precious and The Hunger Games, was philosophical about being passed over - especially as his daughter, ZoÃ« Kravitz, was later cast as bohemian yoga teacher Bonnie Carlson. ""I'm much more happy that she got the role,"" he said. ""It worked out wonderfully."" The singer also denied rumours he'd be joining the show for its second season, playing Bonnie's father. ""As fun as that sounds - that's not going to happen,"" he said. ""But I love all the ladies in the show. I actually just saw them in LA, we had a birthday party for Reese Witherspoon and it was wonderful being with all the ladies and my daughter."" Zoe Kravitz (left) is the daughter of Lenny Kravitz and actress Lisa Bonet Kravitz is about to hit the UK for a series of dates on his world tour, previewing songs from his 11th album, Raise Vibration. Among them is the new single Low and the sumptuous, eight-minute protest songIt's Enough,external. The latter recalls Marvin Gaye's What's Going On as it surveys gun crime, environmental disaster and the abuse of political power; and asks why humanity isn't doing a better job. ""I just thought somehow / That things would get better,"" sings the star over a muted funk groove. ""Well, I really did. I really did,"" he tells the BBC. ""I am one who believes that peace and unity can be achieved. Since my first album in 1989, when I came out with Let Love Rule, I've always stood for that. ""But over the last 30 years that I've lived, I've seen it get worse and worse and worse. ""It's amazing that we just haven't learned how to work together."" Allow YouTube content?

Kravitz recorded the majority of Raise Vibration by himself in his Bahamas home studio, assisted only by his long-serving guitarist Craig Ross. His current tour marks the first time he's played an album in concert before releasing it - which he accepts is a risk. ""Of course it is,"" he says, ""but it's OK to challenge the audience a little bit as well; and not just do the 'typical thing that you know works', you know? ""Otherwise you don't grow."" Besides, Kravitz says, he's better suited to playing Europe in the summer. ""Well, you know, I live in the Bahamas, so I like warm weather,"" he laughs. ""I've done European tours and Russian tours in the dead of winter and it's brutal.""

"Morgan and Reid have been co-presenting on ITV since 2015 Good Morning Britain presenter Susanna Reid has revealed she feels she wages ""a constant battle for airtime"" with her outspoken co-host Piers Morgan. ""Sometimes I open my mouth to ask a question and hear Piers's voice come out,"" she told the Radio Times. ""You can't help but go into battle with him every morning,"" continued Reid, who quit the BBC for ITV in 2014. Morgan and Reid have proved a winning partnership for ITV, but its morning show still trails behind BBC Breakfast. BBC One's breakfast programme has an average daily audience of 1.5 million, around twice the audience who tune into its commercial rival. Reid previously presented BBC Breakfast alongside Bill Turnbull and others Former tabloid editor Morgan joined Good Morning Britain in 2015 with the stated aim of making the show ""unpredictable, provocative [and] lively"". ""I just took a view that the way to make us truly competitive was to shake things up a bit,""he told the BBC last year. Speaking to the Radio Times, Reid admitted that her first reaction to his hiring was ""Arghhh!"" and that sharing the sofa with him was akin to ""sitting next to a hedgehog"". Reid said she struggled with their relationship up until last year, and admits to frequently coming off air in tears. What brought things to a head were the Women's Marches of 2017, of which Morgan was highly critical. Piers Morgan: Breaking the breakfast TV rules Good Morning Britain tops 2017 Ofcom complaints She says what upset her most were the attacks she received from men who accused her of ""enabling his anti-feminist views"". ""The man sitting next to me was spouting off whatever he believes, which I don't agree with... but I had men telling me it was my fault he was saying this. And I was just like, I've had enough of men telling me how I should be a feminist. I've had enough of it."" Reid told the magazine it was then that she realised it wasn't her responsibility to ""pick up the pieces"" after Morgan provoked controversy. Reid made it to the final of Strictly Come Dancing in 2013 She also claims she is ""very happy"" with her current salary and that she does not know how it compares with her co-host's,said to be around Â£1.1 million a year,external. Reid previously presented BBC Breakfast and was a runner-up on Strictly Come Dancing in 2013. Speaking about comparisons between Good Morning Britain and BBC Breakfast, she said: ""I'm quite nervous about conflict, I don't like it. ""[Morgan] loves it, he relishes it. He's actually very good friends with [BBC Breakfast presenter] Dan Walker, which I think a lot of people don't realise - because you see, for Piers, conflict is never personal."" She added: ""I'm not looking at beating the BBC. There are people who want its presenting style in the morning. ""There's something very reassuring, and very likeable about it. No-one's ever going to be offended by Dan and Louise [Minchin]. I know them personally, and they're blinking lovely. You couldn't describe Piers as lovable. ""And I don't think everybody necessarily wants a double espresso shot into their veins in the morning. Some people want a nice cup of tea. And there is absolutely a role for both.""

"Sumir Mahatma said there was ""chaos"" at Bolton station because of the delays Passengers on Northern rail trains have been hit by more disruption after staff walked out in a fresh strike in a long-running dispute over guards. Members of the Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union are staging a 24-hour stoppage, with further walkouts planned for Thursday and Saturday. The company said it would run as many services as possible until 19:00 BST. Customers have reacted angrily to delays and overcrowding with the strike action also being questioned. The union claims imposing driver-only services is a risk to public safety. Regional director for Northern, Sharon Keith, said: ""On each day of the strike action we will be running fewer services and expect those services we do operate to be extremely busy. ""It is, therefore, vital that anyone thinking of travelling with Northern on Tuesday, Thursday or Saturday plans their journey carefully."" Workers strike again in train safety row Rail strike go ahead as talks fail Although 2017 saw fewer strikes on average than in the years between 2011 and 2014, it was the biggest year for workers in the transport and storage sector since 2009. According to the Office for National Statistics, 276,400 working days were lost due to industrial action, of which 187,000 were down to the transport and storage sector. The ONS said 15,100 workers in these industries were involved in 27 stoppages. That compares with 60,200 working days lost in 2015 in 19 stoppages, even though more workers went on strike. The last year in the past decade where there was so much disruption was in 2009. This was a year that saw strikes by Royal Mail workers, who came under the same category for statistical recording, as well as strikes on the London Underground. Sumir Mahatma said there was hundreds of people waiting to get on to one train into Manchester at Bolton station after others had been cancelled, and he ended up late for work. On Twitter, @MCStu1962 said that he no longer had sympathy for the RMT. He said: ""The strikes clearly aren't working because you are only hurting ordinary people yet you keep on doing it."" Strikers also stood together at a picket line in Skipton, North Yorkshire Meanwhile, others were surprised Northern had not backed down in the talks, with @stemcqueenie said ""you would think they would cancel the strikes amid all the timetable chaos"". @GTR_Warwick said there were ""extra carriages and better service"" on a strike day, while @beccimoorby said she felt sorry for the ""poor staff"" and that the company was ""a shambles"".

"Some of the UK's biggest water companies did not support customers properly during this winter's Beast from the East snow chaos, causing ""significant hardship"", Ofwat has said. The regulator said more than 200,000 customers were left without water for more than four hours and tens of thousands were cut off for days. It accused firms of bad planning, communication and a lack of support. Severn Trent, South East, Southern and Thames Water performed worst, it found. The regulator also said it was concerned the Â£7m of compensation paid out to customers may not have been enough and that it would review existing guidelines. Ofwat chief executive Rachel Fletcher said: ""The freeze and rapid thaw earlier this year was forecast and was not unprecedented. ""But too many companies were caught off guard and let people down, causing real hardship as a result. Our report shows there is no excuse for this level of failure."" Speaking toBBC 5 live's Wake up to Money programme, she said: ""There is a huge amount to do to learn some lessons. The industry as a whole really needs to step up to make sure the next time something like this happens, customers are much better served."" The icy spell in late February and early March led to a big increase in the number of burst water mains and in customers' own water pipes as frozen pipes thawed. Water firms saw a spike in burst mains and pipes in the wake of the freeze and thaw But Ofwat said that while suppliers' frontline staff worked tirelessly to fix the issues, higher up some firms lacked proper emergency response plans. Citing survey data from the Consumer Council for Water, Ofwat identified common failings, including: Almost three-quarters of customers whose water supply was disrupted did not receive alternative supplies of water There was limited or inaccurate data on where problems were occurring and whether they had been resolved Only 60% of affected customers received direct communication from their supplier Stakeholders such as councils, schools and emergency services received ""little or no"" proactive communication ""before, during or after the event"". ""In some cases, customers were left to fend for themselves, or depend upon the support of local bodies or volunteers,"" it added. Ofwat said all water companies in England and Wales needed to improve, but it has asked Severn Trent, South East, Southern and Thames Water to publish action plans by 28 September setting out how they would do better next time. Big thaw leaves thousands without water No water? Can you claim compensation? ""We will take action if they don't rise to this challenge,"" Ofwat said of the four. Ms Fletcher told the BBC that punishments had already been imposed, saying: ""We managed to get Â£120m from Thames Water for failing to meet their leakage commitments to customers. ""We have strong fining powers and we're not afraid to use them."" Ofwat also said current compensation arrangements ""were not reflective"" of the impact on customers of being without water for a prolonged period. As such, it will consult on tougher rules obliging firms to provide customers with ""resilient supplies"". This video can not be played Mum in South London: ""Five kids and no water"" In a statement issued on behalf of the four worst performers, industry body Water UK said fewer than 3% of all customers in England and Wales were affected by supply disruptions during the extreme weather. However, it acknowledged significant numbers had experienced ""disruption and hardship"". A spokesman for Severn Trent said: ""We'd like to apologise again to our customers who were affected during the extreme weather in March. Customers rightly expect water whenever they need it, and we've been working hard since March to make improvements to our incident response processes."" Steve Robertson, boss of Thames Water, said: ""I am pleased Ofwat has recognised that frontline staff worked tirelessly in extreme circumstances to restore customer supplies. As the report notes, we rapidly increased water production by 15% to minimise disruption."" He said the scale of leaks and bursts was ""the worst in living memory"" but added: ""We're really sorry we could not protect those customers impacted."" Labour has been putting pressure on the government to tackle what it describes as ""scandalous"" profits made by private water companies. In February, shadow chancellor John McDonnell said suppliers had paid out Â£13.5bn in dividends to shareholders since 2010, while claiming tax breaks and pushing up prices for millions of consumers. The party has pledged torenationalise water, energy and rail companiesif it wins the next election. However, the government said the plan would cost taxpayers billions of pounds and lead to worse services.

"The new threat comes after Beijing vowed to retaliate against US tariffs on $50bn worth of Chinese goods US President Donald Trump has threatened to impose tariffs on an additional $200bn (Â£151bn) of Chinese goods in a growing trade row. Mr Trump said the 10% tariffs would come into effect if China ""refuses to change its practices"". The threats would be a major escalation of the dispute and sparked further falls on stock markets. In the US,the Dow Joneswas down more than 300 points (1.6%) when trading opened in New York on Tuesday. Stock markets in Asia had fallen sharply earlier, with Shanghai faring the worst, down 3.8%. European markets also suffered, with some trading more than 1% lower. China responded by accusing the US of ""blackmail"", raising fears of a full-blown trade war. Its commerce ministry said the country would take ""qualitative"" and ""quantitative"" measures and ""fight back firmly"" against additional tariff measures by the US government. Mr Trump insists that China has been unfairly benefiting from a trade imbalance with the US for years. During the 2016 election campaign, he promised to use tariffs to cut the US trade deficits. But many economists have warned that tariffs are likely to make products more expensive for US consumers and hurt some of the businesses the administration is trying to protect, which depend on China for parts or assembly. What is a trade war and why should I worry? China vows fast response to US tariffs G7 summit ends in disarray over tariffs US tariffs a dangerous game, says EU Last week, Mr Trump confirmed that the US would impose 25% tariffs on $50bn worth of Chinese goods. Beijing responded by saying it would hit 659 US products worth $50bn - including agricultural products, cars and marine products - with a similar tax. This video can not be played How hogs and Harleys became weapons in a looming trade war Late on Monday, the US president condemned China's ""unfair practices related to the acquisition of American intellectual property and technology"". He added: ""Rather than altering those practices, it is now threatening United States companies, workers, and farmers who have done nothing wrong."" Mr Trump added that new tariffs would ""go into effect if China refuses to change its practices, and also if it insists on going forward with the new tariffs that it has recently announced"". ""If China increases its tariffs yet again, we will meet that action by pursuing additional tariffs on another $200bn of goods."" China's commerce ministry reacted swiftly, saying: ""If the US acts irrationally and issues a list, China will have no choice but to take comprehensive measures of a corresponding number and quality and take strong, powerful countermeasures."" January 2018- The US announces tariffs on imported solar panels and washing machines March- Mr Trump unveils plans for a 25% tariff on steel imports and a 10% charge on aluminium April- China announces tariffs on US imports ranging from 15% to 25% on goods ranging from steel pipes to pork May- The US and China put tariff plans ""on hold"" after talks June- Mr Trump decides to push on with plans to impose tariffs in July One analyst wondered if performance at the polls might be behind Mr Trump's latest move. Ritu Vohora of M&G Investments toldBBC Radio 4's Today programme:""There is a lot more at stake here for Trump with the mid-term elections in November. China clearly is very much wanting to be this global tech leader, so neither side really wants to back down."" BBC economics correspondent Andrew Walker Being tough with China plays well with many of President Trump's supporters, actual and potential, at a time when he is looking ahead to the Congressional elections in November. It could also be that he thinks China will run out of US imports against which to retaliate. After all, the US sells a lot less to China than the other way around. But there is also a potential political cost for the president. Many in the Republican Party, who are more instinctively in favour of free trade, don't think this is the right way to tackle problems with China. And as Mr Trump increases the range of goods subject to tariffs it becomes harder for American importers and consumers to avoid the cost by finding alternative suppliers. In the separate dispute about steel and aluminium tariffs, he also has to contend with the politically targeted retaliation that other countries such as Mexico, Canada and the EU have in hand, intended to hit important states in the mid-term elections. The US tariffs previously announced affect more than 800 Chinese products from aircraft tyres to turbines and commercial dishwashers worth $34bn and are due to come into effect on 6 July. In his latest statement, Mr Trump said that he had asked his advisers to identify additional Chinese products on which to impose new tariffs.

"This video can not be played Highlights: Tunisia 1-2 England 2018 Fifa World Cup on the BBC Host:RussiaDates:14 June - 15 July Live:Coverage across BBC TV, BBC Radio and BBC Sport website with further coverage on Red Button, Connected TVs and mobile app. Harry Kane's stoppage-time winner ensured England started their World Cup campaign with victory after Tunisia threatened to snatch a point in Volgograd. Kane scored his second goal of the game with a clever header as Gareth Southgate's side recorded England's first win in the opening game of a major tournament since they beat Paraguay in the 2006 World Cup. England's captain gave them the reward they deserved for a brilliant start by turning in the opener in the 11th minute after Tunisia keeper Mouez Hassen, who went off injured in the first half, clawed out John Stones' header. England ran Tunisia ragged in that spell but were punished for missing a host of chances when Ferjani Sassi equalised from the penalty spot against the run of play after Kyle Walker was penalised for an elbow on Fakhreddine Ben Youssef. Tunisia dug in to frustrate England in the second half but Kane was the match-winner with a late header from Harry Maguire's flick, justice being done after referee Wilmar Roldan and the video assistant referee (VAR) had failed to spot him being wrestled to the ground twice in the penalty area. England play Panama, who lost 3-0 to Belgium earlier on Monday, in their next Group G game on Sunday, which kicks off at 13:00 BST and will be shown live on the BBC. 'Lots of positives but Sterling must improve' Southgate would have been 'proud' of players with draw How social media reacted to the game This video can not be played Harry Kane heads last-gasp England winner England's first-half display contained much to admire but it was a sign of their wastefulness in front of goal that it took the injury-time intervention from Kane to seal victory. England flew at Tunisia and racked up chance after chance, with only Kane's early goal after Hassen clawed out Stones' header to show for it. Dele Alli saw a header deflected on to the woodwork, while Jesse Lingard suffered a similar fate as well as seeing Hassen somehow block another effort with an outstretched leg. Jordan Henderson had a shot saved and other chances were spurned as England fashioned some magnificent approach play only to fail to apply the final flourish. Listen: World Cup Daily podcast How did the players rate? 'Harry the hero' - BBC pundits react to England win It was remarkable that Tunisia reached half-time on level terms as they were often bewildered by England's pace and movement before being spared by their generosity in front of goal. Luckily for England, they have a world-class striker with a golden touch in Kane, who was coolness personified to carefully direct in the winner. England can now move on to face Panama in Nizhny Novgorod with confidence and momentum. This video can not be played Watch how Match of the Day studio reacted to Harry Kane's winner It was 983 days since Raheem Sterling's last goal for England as he stepped out to face Tunisia - and that barren run continues after another night of international frustration for the Manchester City forward. Sterling's attitude and ability is never in doubt, never ducking a challenge or dropping his intensity, but the numbers are simply not stacking up at England level. He became more assured in front of goal in Manchester City's history-making 100-point Premier League title win last season. He seems, however, to feel the old anxieties with England. Sterling was grateful that a glaring miss from Lingard's pass was rescued by a linesman's flag against the Manchester United midfielder, but he almost tried too hard as the game progressed and was running up blind alleys before he was replaced by Marcus Rashford after 68 minutes. Sterling has now failed to score in his past 21 England appearances, while attempting 24 shots - a very grim statistic. He received a warm embrace from Southgate as he went off, but it is time a rare natural ability was transformed into end product for his country. This video can not be played Tunisia penalty pegs back England England complained long and loud about the penalty awarded against Walker, but had much greater cause for grievance over the failure of VAR to give them two spot-kicks of their own. Kane was the victim in incidents plucked straight from the world of wrestling in each half, and on neither occasion did any of the officials - on the pitch or in the VAR booth - see fit to intervene in what were obvious penalties. In the first half, amid some heavy traffic, Kane was dragged crudely to the ground by Sassi and suffered similar treatment after the break, only for the incident to be ignored once again by Roldan and his assistants. Justice was done in the end, but these were glaring errors. It was made clear in a pre-tournament referees' briefing that such grappling would be taken seriously and punished, so England have every right to ask why this edict was not carried out. VAR is undoubtedly a progressive development, but if it is applied with such inconsistency it will stretch its credibility to breaking point. This video can not be played 'You like wrestling?' Pundits analyse Harry Kane penalty appeals England's domination of the first half was almost total, but they somehow contrived to allow Tunisia to raise themselves off the floor by virtue of rank carelessness from Southgate's side. Maguire was a culprit, conceding possession in dangerous areas in a manner that will be punished ruthlessly by teams with more attacking quality than Tunisia. While England felt hard done by with Tunisia's penalty, Walker naively got himself into a very poor position. Ultimately, England did not suffer the ultimate punishment of it costing them points, but they have certainly had an early warning. Southgate, a defender by trade, will surely have noticed the flaws and will be working hard to address them at England's Zelenogorsk training base. This video can not be played Harry Kane scores England's first goal of World Cup Kane became the first England player to score twice in a World Cup match since Gary Lineker against Cameroon in Italy in 1990. England scored more than once for the first time in 10 World Cup matches, since a 2-2 draw against Sweden in 2006 England are unbeaten in their seven meetings with African nations in the World Cup (W4, D3), although this was only the second such match in which they failed to keep a clean sheet England had six shots on target in the first half, their most in the opening 45 minutes of a World Cup match since the 1966 semi-final against Portugal (also six). Harry Kane has scored in his past four games for England, his best run for the national team. Kane has scored 15 goals in 25 appearances for England. The last player to score more in their opening 25 games for England was Gary Lineker (20). England's Kieran Trippier created six goalscoring opportunities, more than any other player has managed in the tournament. Tunisia's Ferjani Sassi scored the first penalty against England in regular play in a World Cup match since Gabriel Batistuta for Argentina in 1998. Tunisia's converted penalty was their only shot on target in the match. Tunisia are without a win in their past 12 World Cup matches (D4 L8), since winning their first match in the competition in 1978.

"Andy McDonald's son Rory died of an epileptic seizure, his son Freddie also has the condition An MP whose teenage son died after an epileptic seizure has said he wonders ""whether he would be with us now"" if cannabis oil had been available to him. Middlesbrough MP Andy McDonald's son Rory died in 2006, when he was 16. He said watching the plight of a Northern Ireland mother,who had oil intended for her epileptic son confiscated from her,was ""difficult"". He called on the government to allow a blanket exemption on the use of cannabis oil to alleviate the illness. Mr McDonald's 23-year-old son Freddie also has epilepsy and needs 24-hour care. The Labour MP said he had been moved by the story of Charlotte Caldwell, who attempted to bring in cannabis oil from Canada for her 12-year-old son Billy. Medical cannabis ban 'bizarre and cruel' Epileptic boy gets cannabis oil back He said: ""When you know what's needed and it's not being given to you, I'm afraid you will move mountains to make it happen, and my heart goes out to these families in these circumstances. ""They should be listened to and supported. They shouldn't have barriers put in their way. It does evoke very strong memories for me and my wife and it's been a difficult day."" He said current publicity around the treatment had left him wondering whether it may have helped his own son during the ""arduous battle"" against his seizures. Cannabis oil has been used to control Billy Caldwell's seizures Mr McDonald said: ""It does cross your mind and you just wonder whether he would be with us now if that had been an option that was made available to us."" The MP has written to Home Secretary Sajid Javid about the issue. He said: ""Look, listen to the medics, listen to the doctors. ""If they say this is working, don't put anything in the way of bringing about that relief because these parents will be living in constant fear of sudden death from epilepsy and nobody wants to have that happen. ""I couldn't wish that on anybody."" Earlier Home Office minister Nick Hurd told the House of Commons that a panel of clinicians, led by England's chief medical officer Dame Sally Davies, will advise ministers on any applications to prescribe the drug.

"This video can not be played Charlotte Caldwell said the medication ordeal had been 'horrific and cruel' A senior MP leading an all-party group looking at medical cannabis has called the existing laws ""bizarre and cruel"". Sir Mike Penning MP has called for ""fundamental reform"" of the system. ""Medical cannabis is a health issue, not a misuse of drugs issue,"" Sir Mike said in a statement. ""It's about patients and relieving suffering."" It follows the home secretary's decision to grant 12-year-old Billy Caldwell temporary access to cannabis oil medication to treat his epilepsy. Mr Penning, who is the proposed chairman of the new All Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) on Medical Cannabis Under Prescription, said: ""It's bizarre and cruel that we have a system that allows the medical use of strong opiates, but bars the medical use of cannabis. ""The current structures within government on this issue are not fit for purpose. We need to move this from criminal justice to health."" He said he supported reclassifying cannabis under the law so it would be regarded as having a medicinal use. Last Monday officials at Heathrow airport confiscated Billy's cannabis oil,  which his mother Charlotte uses to treat his severe epileptic seizures. She had been attempting to bring a supply into the UK from Canada. Ms Caldwell says her son's seizures dramatically reduce when he takes the oil, which contains a substance called Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) that is illegal in the UK. Following the confiscation, Billy was admitted to hospital in London after his seizures ""intensified"". His condition led to Home Secretary Sajid Javid later approving the return of some of the cannabis oil, after doctors made clear it was a medical emergency. Billy was admitted to Chelsea and Westminster hospital in London on Friday The Home Office has granted a limited licence for the drug to be administered to the child in hospital for 20 days. Billy's case has prompted a renewed debate on the legislation surrounding medical cannabis. Sir Mike said many more families needed ""urgent"" access to medical cannabis, adding that the medical use of cannabis was ""totally separate from recreational use"". CBD and Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) are two types of cannabinoids found naturally in the resin of the marijuana plant. A cannabis-based drug called Sativex has been licensed in the UK to treat MS. It contains THC and CBD. Doctors could, in theory, prescribe it for other things outside of this licence, but at their own risk. MS patients prescribed Sativex, who resupply it to other people, also face prosecution. Another licensed treatment is Nabilone. It contains an artificial version of THC and can be given to cancer patients to help relieve nausea during chemotherapy. Source:NHS Choices,external Sir Mike is one of a growing number of MPs from all parties who support the reform of the laws regarding the medicinal use of cannabis and cannabis products. Fellow Conservative Crispin Blunt MP, co-chair of the all-party parliamentary group on drug policy reform, said the existing law was ""frankly absurd"". Ex-Tory health minister Dan Poulter said the current situation was ""ridiculous"" and pledged to push for a change in the law. Former drugs minister Norman Baker, a Liberal Democrat, has described the confiscation as ""cruel and inhumane"", and renewed calls for a law change citing cannabis's ""useful medical properties"". But UCL's Dr Michael Bloomfield said the use of medical marijuana is ""far from straightforward"". He said in some jurisdictions the drug's use for medical conditions is ""a potential way of decriminalising cannabis through the back door"". Many other countries, including much of the US, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands, have legalised the substance's use medicinally.

"Debenhams said full-year profits will be lower than expected - the third time it has issued a profit warning this year. The department store blamed ""increased competitor discounting and weakness in key markets"" for the profit shortfall. It said annual pre-tax profits would come in between Â£35m and Â£40m, below previous estimates of Â£50.3m. Debenhams' latest profit warning comes despite a turnaround plan designed to cut costs and boost sales. Chief executive Sergio Bucher pointed to ""exceptionally difficult times in UK retail"". Shares in Debenhamsfell as much as 16% in early trading before recovering slightly. Debenhams runs 182 stores in the UK, Republic of Ireland and in Denmark, where it operates under the Magasin du Nord name. By Emma Simpson, BBC business correspondent Debenhams is under pressure. The big question is whether it can deliver its turnaround plan quickly enough to adapt to the big structural changes in retail as well as a host of cost pressures. The retailer is caught between the need to bolster its finances but at the same time invest and revamp its stores. It's now cutting back on capital spending next year. Big department stores are expensive to run and require constant investment. Some will be wondering whether it will be able to spend what's really needed on its large number of stores to revive sales. The boss is promising real evidence of progress in the autumn. The race is on to show that the strategy is working and can deliver some much needed growth in the key Christmas season. Debenhams' latest warning adds to a chorus of recent woes on the UK High Street. House of Fraser, Marks & Spencer, New Look and Mothercare have all announced store closures this year. Competition from online retailers, higher import costs due to the weaker pound, a rise in business rates and squeezed household incomes have all combined to make times tough for High Street stores. Why we no longer love department stores Reality Check: Which shops are opening and closing? Six reasons behind the High Street crisis Debenhams said sales had fallen in May and June thanks to rivals' discounting and weak consumer spending. Like-for-like sales, which reflect sales at stores open for more than a year, fell by 1.7% in the 15 weeks to 16 June. Digital sales grew 16% over the same period. Mr Bucher who joined Debenhams in 2016, has launched a turnaround plan, putting more emphasis on food and beauty and improving the firm's online platform. However, in January the chain warned profits would be lower this year after a disappointing Christmas trading period. In April, the retailer warned that the cold weather in late February would eat further into profits. Nicholas Hyett, analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: ""Half a decade of falling sales and heavy discounting has trashed margins and left the group struggling to make ends meet. Unfortunately it all feels like Debenhams is playing catch-up with an industry that's left it behind."" There was more bad news for the retail sector as shares in sportswear retailer Footasylum nearly halved after it reported a slowdown in sales growth and said profits would be lower in the coming year. In its first results since floating on the stock market in November, revenues rose 33% to Â£194.8m in the year to 24 February with underlying profits up 4% at Â£8.4m. However, chief executive Clare Nesbitt said trading since the start of the new financial year had been affected by weak consumer confidence, meaning profits would show ""more modest growth"". Footasylum aims to more than double its 65 stores in the UK. Stockbroker Peel Hunt said there were also longer-term concerns over Footasylum, as major brands such as Nike and Adidas focus on selling directly to consumers and limiting the number of retailers they use: ""Footasylum may find that its access to the cool product files is restricted over time.""

"Customers were refused phone repairs in breach of Australian law An Australian court has fined Apple A$9m (Â£5m;$6.5m) for refusing to fix iPhones and iPads that had been serviced by third parties. The nation's consumer watchdog took the tech giant to court last yearfollowing complaints from users about faulty devices. Apple admitted that it misled 275 people about their rights to remedies such as repairs and replacements. The Federal Court of Australia found those actions breached consumer law. The investigation followed complaints about Apple's so-called ""error 53"". The fault rendered iPhones and iPads inoperable, after users downloaded a software update. But when customers sought repairs, Apple denied some of them assistance because their devices had previously been fixed by a third party, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) said. Apple apologises for iPhone 'error 53' Tech giant to close iPhone security loophole Apple sorry for slowing down older phones In many cases, Apple refused remedies even when the third-party repair was for something like a cracked screen and not related to the fault, the ACCC said. ""The court declared the mere fact that an iPhone or iPad had been repaired by someone other than Apple did not, and could not, result in the consumer guarantees ceasing to apply,"" Commissioner Sarah Court said on Tuesday. The watchdog said Apple had contacted about 5,000 customers to compensate them for the error. In 2016,Apple was forced to issue a fix and apologise for error 53 after similar claims.

"The singer previously starred in films including Precious, The Butler and The Hunger Games Rock star Lenny Kravitz says he lost a role on the TV show Big Little Lies because producers felt uneasy about casting a black actor as a villain. The star was ""considered to play one of the husbands"" in the drama, which revolves around three emotionally troubled women in suburban California. Big Little Lies was one of the most critically-lauded dramas of 2017,  with an all-star cast including Reese Witherspoon, Nicole Kidman and Laura Dern. Had he won the role, Kravitz would have been ""the only black man on the show,"" he told the BBC. ""And the word that came back to me was that, if I was the only black man on the show, they didn't want me doing what it was that I would be doing. ""So that ended up not happening,"" Kravitz added. ""The director [Jean-Marc VallÃ©e] was like, 'I so want you for this but we'll work together another time.'"" Kravitz declined to specify which role he was up for (""I can't really say"") - but it seems likely he was referring to Perry Wright, who is seen subjecting his wife Celeste to vicious beatings and psychological torture throughout the HBO series. The part eventually went to Alexander SkarsgÃ¥rd, who won both an Emmy and a Golden Globe for his performance. The BBC contacted HBO for a response to Kravitz's story, but was told that ""producers are deep into production on the second season for Big Little Lies and are unavailable for comment"". Alexander Skarsgard and Nicole Kidman won multiple awards for their harrowing portrayal of domestic violence A second series of Big Little Lies is already in production with Meryl Streep expected to join the cast. Adapted from the Liane Moriarty novel of the same name, it touched a nerve with viewers in dealing with divorce, domestic violence, the troubles of raising children, school bullying, and ageing. Kravitz, who previously starred in films like Precious and The Hunger Games, was philosophical about being passed over - especially as his daughter, ZoÃ« Kravitz, was later cast as bohemian yoga teacher Bonnie Carlson. ""I'm much more happy that she got the role,"" he said. ""It worked out wonderfully."" The singer also denied rumours he'd be joining the show for its second season, playing Bonnie's father. ""As fun as that sounds - that's not going to happen,"" he said. ""But I love all the ladies in the show. I actually just saw them in LA, we had a birthday party for Reese Witherspoon and it was wonderful being with all the ladies and my daughter."" Zoe Kravitz (left) is the daughter of Lenny Kravitz and actress Lisa Bonet Kravitz is about to hit the UK for a series of dates on his world tour, previewing songs from his 11th album, Raise Vibration. Among them is the new single Low and the sumptuous, eight-minute protest songIt's Enough,external. The latter recalls Marvin Gaye's What's Going On as it surveys gun crime, environmental disaster and the abuse of political power; and asks why humanity isn't doing a better job. ""I just thought somehow / That things would get better,"" sings the star over a muted funk groove. ""Well, I really did. I really did,"" he tells the BBC. ""I am one who believes that peace and unity can be achieved. Since my first album in 1989, when I came out with Let Love Rule, I've always stood for that. ""But over the last 30 years that I've lived, I've seen it get worse and worse and worse. ""It's amazing that we just haven't learned how to work together."" Allow YouTube content?

Kravitz recorded the majority of Raise Vibration by himself in his Bahamas home studio, assisted only by his long-serving guitarist Craig Ross. His current tour marks the first time he's played an album in concert before releasing it - which he accepts is a risk. ""Of course it is,"" he says, ""but it's OK to challenge the audience a little bit as well; and not just do the 'typical thing that you know works', you know? ""Otherwise you don't grow."" Besides, Kravitz says, he's better suited to playing Europe in the summer. ""Well, you know, I live in the Bahamas, so I like warm weather,"" he laughs. ""I've done European tours and Russian tours in the dead of winter and it's brutal.""

"Sumir Mahatma said there was ""chaos"" at Bolton station because of the delays Passengers on Northern rail trains have been hit by more disruption after staff walked out in a fresh strike in a long-running dispute over guards. Members of the Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union are staging a 24-hour stoppage, with further walkouts planned for Thursday and Saturday. The company said it would run as many services as possible until 19:00 BST. Customers have reacted angrily to delays and overcrowding with the strike action also being questioned. The union claims imposing driver-only services is a risk to public safety. Regional director for Northern, Sharon Keith, said: ""On each day of the strike action we will be running fewer services and expect those services we do operate to be extremely busy. ""It is, therefore, vital that anyone thinking of travelling with Northern on Tuesday, Thursday or Saturday plans their journey carefully."" Workers strike again in train safety row Rail strike go ahead as talks fail Although 2017 saw fewer strikes on average than in the years between 2011 and 2014, it was the biggest year for workers in the transport and storage sector since 2009. According to the Office for National Statistics, 276,400 working days were lost due to industrial action, of which 187,000 were down to the transport and storage sector. The ONS said 15,100 workers in these industries were involved in 27 stoppages. That compares with 60,200 working days lost in 2015 in 19 stoppages, even though more workers went on strike. The last year in the past decade where there was so much disruption was in 2009. This was a year that saw strikes by Royal Mail workers, who came under the same category for statistical recording, as well as strikes on the London Underground. Sumir Mahatma said there was hundreds of people waiting to get on to one train into Manchester at Bolton station after others had been cancelled, and he ended up late for work. On Twitter, @MCStu1962 said that he no longer had sympathy for the RMT. He said: ""The strikes clearly aren't working because you are only hurting ordinary people yet you keep on doing it."" Strikers also stood together at a picket line in Skipton, North Yorkshire Meanwhile, others were surprised Northern had not backed down in the talks, with @stemcqueenie said ""you would think they would cancel the strikes amid all the timetable chaos"". @GTR_Warwick said there were ""extra carriages and better service"" on a strike day, while @beccimoorby said she felt sorry for the ""poor staff"" and that the company was ""a shambles"".

"The auditing work of one of the world's ""Big Four"" accounting firms has been sharply criticised by the industry's watchdog. KPMG audits had shown an ""unacceptable deterioration"" and will be subject to closer supervision, the Financial Reporting Council said. The FRC added all the Big Four - which also include PwC, EY and Deloitte - needed to reverse a decline. KPMG said it was ""disappointed"" and was taking steps to improve audit quality. Every year the watchdog reviews the audits of Britain's biggest companies to ensure they meet certain standards. The FRC noted problems at all the firms, but KPMG was singled out for the poor quality of its work. ""There has been an unacceptable deterioration in quality at one firm, KPMG,"" the FRC said in a statement. ""50% of KPMG's FTSE 350 audits required more than just limited improvements, compared to 35% in the previous year."" Stephen Haddrill, head of the FRC, said: ""At a time when public trust in business and in audit is in the spotlight, the Big Four must improve the quality of their audits and do so quickly. ""They must address urgently several factors that are vital to audit, including the level of challenge and scepticism by auditors, in particular in their bank audits.  We also expect improvements in group audits and in the audit of pension balances."" He said firms ""must strenuously renew"" their efforts to improve audit quality to meet the legitimate expectation of investors and other stakeholders. The increased scrutiny of KPMG will involve the FRC inspecting 25% more audits done by the firm in the 2018-19 financial year, the first time the FRC has taken such action. Michelle Hinchcliffe, head of audit at KPMG, said: ""We are disappointed that our overall audit quality score for our 2016/17 audits has decreased by 4% and that the steps taken in previous years have not resulted in the necessary improvements to audit quality. We are taking action to resolve this."" KPMG came in for criticism over its audit of collapsed construction firm Carillion earlier this year, and the FRC has opened an investigation into the group under the Audit Enforcement Procedure. The auditor was also recently fined Â£3.2m by the watchdog over its audit of insurance firm Quindell. Last year, the FRC opened an investigation into KPMG's audit of the accounts of aero-engine maker Rolls-Royce. Auditors review the accounts of firms to see if the figures are a true and fair reflection of companies' financial health. But the accounting industry has faced a lot of criticism in the last few years over whether their verdicts on companies' accounts can be trusted.

"MPs will vote again on how much of a say Parliament should have on Brexit, after another House of Lords defeat for the government. Peers decided MPs should have to approve whatever the government decided to do next if there was no final agreement with the EU. Their amendment to the EU (Withdrawal) Bill was backed by 354 votes to 235. It means the issue is sent back to the House of Commons for a debate on Wednesday. Leading Tory Eurosceptic Jacob Rees-Mogg accused the Lords of being ""cavalier"" towards the UK's constitution. Mark D'Arcy: Week of drama? Government 'could collapse' over Brexit deal Brexit: All you need to know The UK is due to leave the European Union in March 2019. And negotiations have been taking place over the terms of its departure. But there is an ongoing row about what happens if Parliament votes to reject the final deal reached between the two sides - or if no deal is reached. One side says Parliament should intervene to prevent the UK from ""crashing out"" of the EU without a deal - but critics say the prospect of this happening would undermine the UK's negotiating hand. Last week, Theresa May avoided defeat on the issue - but rebels said they were not happy with the concessions they had been offered in return for not voting against the government. Now, peers have backed an amendment from former Conservative cabinet minister Lord Hailsham, which goes further than the government's proposals on how much power MPs could get. The 119 majority was 28 more than the last time peers voted on the so-called ""meaningful vote"" issue. Lord Hailsham, who described Brexit as a ""national calamity"" in his speech, said his amendment represented what had been agreed ""in good faith"" by the would-be Tory rebels, led by former Attorney General Dominic Grieve, and Downing Street last week. ""It's a matter of honour,"" he said. He also said his proposals were in the ""national interest"", adding: ""In order to safeguard our nation's vital interests, in the event that there be no deal on the table, Parliament should have the authority to intervene."" Lord Hailsham described hisamendment,externalas ""Grieve Two"", meaning it was a new version of proposals tabled last week by former Attorney General Dominic Grieve, who wants Parliament to get more of a say over Brexit. It would apply in three scenarios: If MPs vote down the UK-EU Brexit deal If Theresa May announces before 21 January 2019 that no deal has been reached If 21 January passes with no deal being struck Under these circumstances, the government has said, a minister will make a statement in Parliament, setting out the government's next steps. The government had offered MPs the chance to vote ""on neutral terms"" on this statement. But the amendment backed by the Lords on Monday goes further, saying the statement would have to be approved by MPs. Lord Hailsham also criticised what he called ""disgraceful"" newspaper attacks on Mr Grieve and said it was ""perfectly true"" that he had held talks with other parties in drawing up his amendment. ""I make absolutely no apology for that,"" he said. ""This is the high court of Parliament, and we are not party hacks."" Lord Hailsham's fellow Tory peer Lord True said ministers had already ""made a serious attempt to compromise"" with the rebels' demands. ""People outside Parliament are getting a little bit tired of the parliamentary games,"" he said. ""They actually want to know when they're going to get Brexit, when it will be delivered and when it will be done.""

"Lord Hague said Billy Caldwell's case was an ""illuminating moment"" The government has rejected a call from Lord Hague to consider legalising the recreational use of cannabis. In an article forthe Daily Telegraph,,externalthe former Tory leader said the war on cannabis had been ""irreversibly lost"" and a change of policy was needed. His call was prompted by the case of a boy with epilepsy who was given a special licence to use cannabis oil. Home Secretary Sajid Javid has told MPsthere will be a review of the medical use of cannabisin the UK. The Home Office has set up an expert panel to review the rules on the therapeutic use of the drug, but a spokesman stressed that the existing laws on the recreational use of cannabis would not be changed. ""Any debate within government about the efficacy and therapeutic use of cannabis-based medicines emphatically does not extend to any review regarding the classification of cannabis and the penalties for the illicit possession, cultivation and trafficking of cannabis will remain the same."" Medicinal cannabis use to be reviewed Cannabis debate: What you need to know Why not... legalise drugs? Most UK cannabis 'super strength skunk' Cannabis is not recognised as having any therapeutic value under the law in England and Wales and anyone buying or using it can be arrested or jailed. One cannabis-based product - Sativex - can be legally prescribed in limited circumstances usually to help alleviate the symptoms of multiple sclerosis and the government is open to further applications. The parents of children with severe epilepsy are calling for cannabis-derived drugs to be made available to their offspring. Last week officials at Heathrow Airport confiscated Billy Caldwell's cannabis oil, which the 12-year-old's mother Charlotte had been attempting to bring into the UK from Canada. The Home Office returned some of the medicine after protests from Ms Caldwell, and assurances from the medical team treating Billy that the treatment was necessary. Billy was discharged from hospital on Monday, but will continue to be treated with the oil. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said it was obvious the government was not ""getting the law on this kind of thing right"" and suggested a review would take place ""as quickly as possible"". This video can not be played Hannah Deacon, whose son suffers from epilepsy, says she was given a promise by Theresa May It was ""nothing short of deluded"" to think cannabis can be driven off the streets, Lord Hague wrote Lord Hague said the debate about Billy Caldwell was ""one of those illuminating moments when a longstanding policy is revealed to be inappropriate, ineffective and utterly out of date"". By returning the medicine to the Caldwell family, the Home Office had ""implicitly conceded that the law has become indefensible"", he said. Licensing cannabis for medical use would be a ""step forward"", he said, but the Conservatives should be as ""bold"" as Canada where state-regulated recreational consumption was being considered. Others have said he is in danger of confusing two separate issues. Lord Hague is not the first politician to call for the legalisation of cannabis - but he is the most senior Conservative to do so. The party has traditionally taken a hard line on drugs, including when Lord Hague was its leader between 1997 and 2001. He now says it is ""deluded"" to think cannabis could be driven off the streets, adding that the ""battle is effectively over"". 'I want to produce the world's best cannabis' Legalising cannabis 'could raise Â£1bn' Cannabis: Promise, risk and controversy He said the fact that cannabis was both illegal and widely available effectively permitted ""the worst of all worlds"" to arise: encouraging more potent and dangerous variants of the drug, with users reluctant to seek help. He said the ""only beneficiaries"" of the current law were ""organised crime gangs"". Similar arguments have been made for decades by those campaigning for the liberalisation of drugs laws, with little impact on government. Many other countries, including much of the US, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands, have legalised the use of medicinal cannabis, but very few have legalised recreational use. Prime Minister Theresa May remains firmly opposed to legalisation or decriminalisation of the drug because of the harm she says it does to individual users and communities. Legalisation of cannabis could see it being sold in shops or by licensed distributors, in the same way as alcohol or tobacco. This differs from decriminalisation, under which possession of the drug is no longer a criminal offence, but sales are still prohibited. The UK downgraded cannabis to a Class C drug in 2002 - putting it in the same category as steroids - with possession of small quantities no longer an arrestable offence. But it was moved back up to Class B by then Prime Minister Gordon Brown in 2008, with penalties for possession of up to five years in prison. Supplying attracts a sentence of up to 14 years imprisonment and an unlimited fine. According to Home Office statistics, cannabis was the most commonly used drug in the UK in 2016-17, with 6.6% of adults aged 16 to 59 having used it. That's about 2.2 million people. Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable said his party supported the legal sale of cannabis for recreational use provided it was ""properly regulated"" and sold by ""legalised distributors"", which he said ""would reduce the harm caused by ""potent and damaging forms"" of the drug. He claimed legalisation would not lead to greater consumption, telling BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""If it was carefully regulated and heavily taxed there wouldn't be any incentive to use it."" Boy discharged after getting cannabis oil Reality Check: Does UK export the most legal cannabis? 'Law not right' on medical cannabis use The Green Party is also in favour of legalisation of cannabis, arguing it would ""reduce the harm associated with it"". Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has said he would decriminalise cannabis for medicinal purposes. But a Labour government would ""look at the medical effects on the wider community and on cannabis users"" before deciding whether to back legalisation for recreational use, he added. Conservative MP Crispin Blunt, chairman of an all-party Parliamentary Group on drugs reform, said Lord Hague was ""absolutely right"" and the current laws had failed, adding that selling cannabis legally would generate substantial tax revenues. The majority of assembly members in Wales, the SNP and all parties in Northern Ireland except the DUP have backed medical legalisation of cannabis. The Royal College of Nursing also voted overwhelmingly in favour of lobbying the government to make it legal for medical use last month. The Royal College of Psychiatrists says legalisation for recreational and medicinal use should be considered as distinct. It says cannabis carries significant mental health risks but it supports the medicinal use of approved cannabis products. Campaigners against legalisation argue that it would normalise the use of drugs among children and lead to greater addiction and health problems. Conservative MP Laurence Robertson warned it could lead to cannabis being sold in shops ""alongside Mars bars and cans of coke"" and that it would not kill off the ""illicit"" trade in the drug, saying taxing cigarettes had led to a booming black market. Prime Minister Theresa May last year vowed to continue the ""war on drugs,"" saying ""the incredible damage [drugs] can do to families and the individuals concerned"".

"Andy McDonald's son Rory died of an epileptic seizure, his son Freddie also has the condition An MP whose teenage son died after an epileptic seizure has said he wonders ""whether he would be with us now"" if cannabis oil had been available to him. Middlesbrough MP Andy McDonald's son Rory died in 2006, when he was 16. He said watching the plight of a Northern Ireland mother,who had oil intended for her epileptic son confiscated from her,was ""difficult"". He called on the government to allow a blanket exemption on the use of cannabis oil to alleviate the illness. Mr McDonald's 23-year-old son Freddie also has epilepsy and needs 24-hour care. The Labour MP said he had been moved by the story of Charlotte Caldwell, who attempted to bring in cannabis oil from Canada for her 12-year-old son Billy. Medical cannabis ban 'bizarre and cruel' Epileptic boy gets cannabis oil back He said: ""When you know what's needed and it's not being given to you, I'm afraid you will move mountains to make it happen, and my heart goes out to these families in these circumstances. ""They should be listened to and supported. They shouldn't have barriers put in their way. It does evoke very strong memories for me and my wife and it's been a difficult day."" He said current publicity around the treatment had left him wondering whether it may have helped his own son during the ""arduous battle"" against his seizures. Cannabis oil has been used to control Billy Caldwell's seizures Mr McDonald said: ""It does cross your mind and you just wonder whether he would be with us now if that had been an option that was made available to us."" The MP has written to Home Secretary Sajid Javid about the issue. He said: ""Look, listen to the medics, listen to the doctors. ""If they say this is working, don't put anything in the way of bringing about that relief because these parents will be living in constant fear of sudden death from epilepsy and nobody wants to have that happen. ""I couldn't wish that on anybody.""

"This video can not be played Highlights: Tunisia 1-2 England 2018 Fifa World Cup on the BBC Host:RussiaDates:14 June - 15 July Live:Coverage across BBC TV, BBC Radio and BBC Sport website with further coverage on Red Button, Connected TVs and mobile app. Harry Kane's stoppage-time winner ensured England started their World Cup campaign with victory after Tunisia threatened to snatch a point in Volgograd. Kane scored his second goal of the game with a clever header as Gareth Southgate's side recorded England's first win in the opening game of a major tournament since they beat Paraguay in the 2006 World Cup. England's captain gave them the reward they deserved for a brilliant start by turning in the opener in the 11th minute after Tunisia keeper Mouez Hassen, who went off injured in the first half, clawed out John Stones' header. England ran Tunisia ragged in that spell but were punished for missing a host of chances when Ferjani Sassi equalised from the penalty spot against the run of play after Kyle Walker was penalised for an elbow on Fakhreddine Ben Youssef. Tunisia dug in to frustrate England in the second half but Kane was the match-winner with a late header from Harry Maguire's flick, justice being done after referee Wilmar Roldan and the video assistant referee (VAR) had failed to spot him being wrestled to the ground twice in the penalty area. England play Panama, who lost 3-0 to Belgium earlier on Monday, in their next Group G game on Sunday, which kicks off at 13:00 BST and will be shown live on the BBC. 'Lots of positives but Sterling must improve' Southgate would have been 'proud' of players with draw How social media reacted to the game This video can not be played Harry Kane heads last-gasp England winner England's first-half display contained much to admire but it was a sign of their wastefulness in front of goal that it took the injury-time intervention from Kane to seal victory. England flew at Tunisia and racked up chance after chance, with only Kane's early goal after Hassen clawed out Stones' header to show for it. Dele Alli saw a header deflected on to the woodwork, while Jesse Lingard suffered a similar fate as well as seeing Hassen somehow block another effort with an outstretched leg. Jordan Henderson had a shot saved and other chances were spurned as England fashioned some magnificent approach play only to fail to apply the final flourish. Listen: World Cup Daily podcast How did the players rate? 'Harry the hero' - BBC pundits react to England win It was remarkable that Tunisia reached half-time on level terms as they were often bewildered by England's pace and movement before being spared by their generosity in front of goal. Luckily for England, they have a world-class striker with a golden touch in Kane, who was coolness personified to carefully direct in the winner. England can now move on to face Panama in Nizhny Novgorod with confidence and momentum. This video can not be played Watch how Match of the Day studio reacted to Harry Kane's winner It was 983 days since Raheem Sterling's last goal for England as he stepped out to face Tunisia - and that barren run continues after another night of international frustration for the Manchester City forward. Sterling's attitude and ability is never in doubt, never ducking a challenge or dropping his intensity, but the numbers are simply not stacking up at England level. He became more assured in front of goal in Manchester City's history-making 100-point Premier League title win last season. He seems, however, to feel the old anxieties with England. Sterling was grateful that a glaring miss from Lingard's pass was rescued by a linesman's flag against the Manchester United midfielder, but he almost tried too hard as the game progressed and was running up blind alleys before he was replaced by Marcus Rashford after 68 minutes. Sterling has now failed to score in his past 21 England appearances, while attempting 24 shots - a very grim statistic. He received a warm embrace from Southgate as he went off, but it is time a rare natural ability was transformed into end product for his country. This video can not be played Tunisia penalty pegs back England England complained long and loud about the penalty awarded against Walker, but had much greater cause for grievance over the failure of VAR to give them two spot-kicks of their own. Kane was the victim in incidents plucked straight from the world of wrestling in each half, and on neither occasion did any of the officials - on the pitch or in the VAR booth - see fit to intervene in what were obvious penalties. In the first half, amid some heavy traffic, Kane was dragged crudely to the ground by Sassi and suffered similar treatment after the break, only for the incident to be ignored once again by Roldan and his assistants. Justice was done in the end, but these were glaring errors. It was made clear in a pre-tournament referees' briefing that such grappling would be taken seriously and punished, so England have every right to ask why this edict was not carried out. VAR is undoubtedly a progressive development, but if it is applied with such inconsistency it will stretch its credibility to breaking point. This video can not be played 'You like wrestling?' Pundits analyse Harry Kane penalty appeals England's domination of the first half was almost total, but they somehow contrived to allow Tunisia to raise themselves off the floor by virtue of rank carelessness from Southgate's side. Maguire was a culprit, conceding possession in dangerous areas in a manner that will be punished ruthlessly by teams with more attacking quality than Tunisia. While England felt hard done by with Tunisia's penalty, Walker naively got himself into a very poor position. Ultimately, England did not suffer the ultimate punishment of it costing them points, but they have certainly had an early warning. Southgate, a defender by trade, will surely have noticed the flaws and will be working hard to address them at England's Zelenogorsk training base. This video can not be played Harry Kane scores England's first goal of World Cup Kane became the first England player to score twice in a World Cup match since Gary Lineker against Cameroon in Italy in 1990. England scored more than once for the first time in 10 World Cup matches, since a 2-2 draw against Sweden in 2006 England are unbeaten in their seven meetings with African nations in the World Cup (W4, D3), although this was only the second such match in which they failed to keep a clean sheet England had six shots on target in the first half, their most in the opening 45 minutes of a World Cup match since the 1966 semi-final against Portugal (also six). Harry Kane has scored in his past four games for England, his best run for the national team. Kane has scored 15 goals in 25 appearances for England. The last player to score more in their opening 25 games for England was Gary Lineker (20). England's Kieran Trippier created six goalscoring opportunities, more than any other player has managed in the tournament. Tunisia's Ferjani Sassi scored the first penalty against England in regular play in a World Cup match since Gabriel Batistuta for Argentina in 1998. Tunisia's converted penalty was their only shot on target in the match. Tunisia are without a win in their past 12 World Cup matches (D4 L8), since winning their first match in the competition in 1978.

"A list of failed safety regulations has been presented to a public inquiry into the Grenfell Tower blaze. Dr Barbara Lane said lifts in the tower were sub-standard, fire doors had not been replaced and combustible material was fitted around windows. She said the ""very basis"" of the policy telling people to stay in their flats during a fire only worked alongside other protection measures. But the standards firefighters relied on ""failed"" at 01:26 GMT. A total of 72 people died as a result into the fire on 14 June 2017 in North Kensington, west London. What happened at Grenfell Tower? Who were the victims? Grenfell Inquiry: What five reports reveal The Grenfell Tower Inquiry with Eddie Mair - Monday's podcast Dr Lane, a chartered fire safety engineer, released a report about the fire two weeks ago, but on Monday gave evidence to Sir Martin Moore-Bick's inquiry. The hearing was told that Grenfell Tower was completed in 1974 and had 19 different sets of works on it up until 2017. But a number of the additions or refurbishments did not comply with regulations, according to Dr Lane. She said the lifts in the building were not up to the standard for firefighters, despite having been refurbished in 2005. The doors were not as fire resistant as they needed to be and did not have a secondary power supply. Dr Lane also said the lifts had no escape hatches, making them unsuitable for the evacuation of disabled people. The anniversary of the ifre that led to the deaths of 72 people was marked last week Dr Lane then described how only 106 of the 120 doors in the tower were replaced after additional refurbishments in 2011, meaning it is assumed the other doors had been there since 1974. At that time, building regulations meant they only had to be fire resistant for 20 minutes - but current regulations raises this to an hour. She told the inquiry: ""Fire doors are a crucial element of the stay-put strategy, as they represent an opportunity for weak spots to form in the fire-resistant partitions that separate a flat fire from occupants either on that floor where the fire has started or occupants in the flat above the floor the fire has started. ""Fire doors are, therefore, a building regulations requirement as a passive fire protection measure. Faulty fire doors mean faulty compartmentation and compartmentation is the primary basis of the stay-put strategy."" Dr Lane also said the dry rising mains in the tower - through which firefighters pump water to tackle fires in high-rise buildings - were also not suitable for a building of its height. Dr Lane said the dry riser loses effectiveness as the height of the building increases and rely on good water pressure to work against gravity. But eventually, the lack of water pressure means it cannot operate effectively. Buildings more than 50m in height should have a pressurised tank already in the building for firefighters to use, yet Grenfell Tower - measuring 67.3m - did not have one. A gas pipe installed in 2016 penetrated both the protected stair compartment wall and the protected flat compartment walls, Dr Lane added. She said the pipe - one of six gas risers running vertically up the block - had incomplete compartmentation and ventilation around it to protect it from fire. The hearing continues on Tuesday from 10:00 BST with further experts giving evidence throughout the week. Why was 'stay put' Grenfell advice so disastrous?

"The auditing work of one of the world's ""Big Four"" accounting firms has been sharply criticised by the industry's watchdog. KPMG audits had shown an ""unacceptable deterioration"" and will be subject to closer supervision, the Financial Reporting Council said. The FRC added all the Big Four - which also include PwC, EY and Deloitte - needed to reverse a decline. KPMG said it was ""disappointed"" and was taking steps to improve audit quality. Every year the watchdog reviews the audits of Britain's biggest companies to ensure they meet certain standards. The FRC noted problems at all the firms, but KPMG was singled out for the poor quality of its work. ""There has been an unacceptable deterioration in quality at one firm, KPMG,"" the FRC said in a statement. ""50% of KPMG's FTSE 350 audits required more than just limited improvements, compared to 35% in the previous year."" Stephen Haddrill, head of the FRC, said: ""At a time when public trust in business and in audit is in the spotlight, the Big Four must improve the quality of their audits and do so quickly. ""They must address urgently several factors that are vital to audit, including the level of challenge and scepticism by auditors, in particular in their bank audits.  We also expect improvements in group audits and in the audit of pension balances."" He said firms ""must strenuously renew"" their efforts to improve audit quality to meet the legitimate expectation of investors and other stakeholders. The increased scrutiny of KPMG will involve the FRC inspecting 25% more audits done by the firm in the 2018-19 financial year, the first time the FRC has taken such action. Michelle Hinchcliffe, head of audit at KPMG, said: ""We are disappointed that our overall audit quality score for our 2016/17 audits has decreased by 4% and that the steps taken in previous years have not resulted in the necessary improvements to audit quality. We are taking action to resolve this."" KPMG came in for criticism over its audit of collapsed construction firm Carillion earlier this year, and the FRC has opened an investigation into the group under the Audit Enforcement Procedure. The auditor was also recently fined Â£3.2m by the watchdog over its audit of insurance firm Quindell. Last year, the FRC opened an investigation into KPMG's audit of the accounts of aero-engine maker Rolls-Royce. Auditors review the accounts of firms to see if the figures are a true and fair reflection of companies' financial health. But the accounting industry has faced a lot of criticism in the last few years over whether their verdicts on companies' accounts can be trusted.
