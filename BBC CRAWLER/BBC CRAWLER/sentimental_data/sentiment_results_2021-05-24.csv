"The Dedicated Card and Payment Crime Unit said it was working with Royal Mail and other groups as part of the investigation Eight men have been arrested in dawn raids targeting scam text messages. The suspects were allegedly involved in sending fake messages, primarily posing as Royal Mail and asking people to pay a fee to retrieve a parcel. The men were arrested in Birmingham, Coventry, London and Colchester, Essex, a specialist unit of the City of London and Metropolitan Police said. A man from London was charged with three offences and the others were released under investigation. The charged man, from Enfield, will appear at Inner London Crown Court on 21 June. He faces charges of fraud by false representation; possession of articles for use in fraud; possession of criminal property (money laundering), a spokeswoman for the Dedicated Card and Payment Crime Unit (DCPCU) said.

"Donna and her 10-year-old son Javon A private special needs school, whose directors include businessmen associated with theWinterbourne View care home scandal,has been accused of putting profit ahead of pupils' needs. Annual fees paid by councils to send pupils to Leaways School in east London are Â£53,000 - higher than Eton. One parent told a BBC investigation she is pulling out her son as she fears for his mental state if he stays there. However, Leaways denied the claims that it put money ahead of welfare. In a statement, the school said: ""We strongly refute the suggestion profit is ever put ahead of the needs of children. ""The vast majority of families are happy with our school and they see their children doing very well here."" The school says it was ""deeply saddened to hear the opinions of a small minority... of our parent and staff community"". One is Donna, who fought to get her 10-year-old son Javon into Leaways almost two years ago, believing the school would provide state-of-the-art support for an autistic child. Now she says: ""I was sold a dream. They actually have no idea... I feel like if my son stays there any longer, it will be detrimental to his mental state."" Being there makes him anxious, she says, often he becomes mute, not speaking all day, or isolating himself for hours in the school's sensory room. Lee Boyce, a former assistant head at Leaways, describes ""a kind of systemic failure at a leadership level to... understand the complexity of those children's needs and to put in place provision that met them"". Former Leaways assistant head Lee Boyce (R) with another former teacher, Lucy When she left in 2019, she says working conditions were stressful and a high staff turnover and absence rates contributed to a ""chaotic environment"" for pupils who were often already volatile. Lee, now a principal inclusion advisor for a London borough, specialises in keeping such pupils in mainstream schools and says the Â£53,000 could be better spent. ""If you had even half of what you get for a child at Leaways... you could do amazing things,"" she says. Leaways is part of Kedleston Group, which runs 13 schools and homes in England. Kedleston's directors include Denis and Paul Brosnan. In 2011, they were directors of Castlebeck, which owned the Winterbourne View private hospital near Bristol, where serious abuse was uncovered by a BBC Panorama investigation. An inquiry the following year found Castlebeck""took financial reward without the responsibility"". Some current Leaways staff believe profit is paramount at the school. ""It's a business that happens to be a school,"" one support worker told the BBC. In 2019, Kedleston Group, which is owned by a Jersey-based holding company, had: a Â£5.3m operating profit, up from Â£4m in 2018 a turnover of Â£32.7m, up nearly Â£4m on 2018 operating profit on its London schools of Â£740,000 Donna says Javon's Education and Health Care Plan (EHCP) - a legal document which details a child's special educational needs and the support required - was not reviewed for nearly two years. By law, these documents must be reviewed annually and this timescale remained in place during the pandemic. Donna claims the amount of speech and language therapy and emotional literacy coaching provided by the school fell below the levels specified in his plan. ""How do you explain to a child with autism, that in actual fact mum got it totally wrong?"" This video can not be played Donna: ""How do I explain to him I got it wrong?"" Donna is not the only parent wanting to remove her child. Another, who asked not to be named, also told of delays to educational reviews and inadequate therapy. At first sight Leaways ""appears to be a super specialist school, glory and glitter. It ignites hopefulness and it's just not that"", she said. In 2016, when Brenda's son Ethan started at Leaways, she says: ""Everything was perfect."" But in 2017 the head teacher left, followed by Ethan's teacher, and the class was led by a teaching assistant for most of the next school year, Brenda adds. Leaways says the use of teaching assistants to lead classes is ""kept to an absolute minimum"" and only when the alternative is ""not to have the children in school at all"". ""Where possible we ensure that the teaching assistant is experienced, has an aptitude for leading the class and has a higher-level qualification,"" it said. ""The school does not have a materially different staff turnover rate to the industry norm."" But without a class teacher, Brenda says Ethan became anxious and aggressive and started having seizures. Brenda's son Ethan now attends a state-run special needs school near their home in Enfield, north London When he was checked out for epilepsy at Great Ormond Street hospital, the consultant said: ""It's not epilepsy. It's anxiety,"" she remembers. Eventually the school appointed a new teacher, ""a godsend"", according to Brenda, and Ethan's mental state improved, But in the summer of 2019, she also left and Brenda decided it was time to remove Ethan. The family felt there was no-one to hear why they were taking out their son: ""There was nobody to tell. We just weren't confident any more,"" says Brenda. Lucy, who asked not to use her full name, was Ethan's teacher in his last year at Leaways. She was hoping to gain experience as a specialist autism teacher, an area where she had no formal training, but within weeks of starting in the school's specialist unit, says she was asked to lead it. She declined, saying: ""It wasn't what I was expecting... It became clear quite quickly that the school were making a profit from not meeting the needs of children."" Leaways is in a converted building in Hackney, east London Some of the teachers were unqualified, she says, and support staff often had very limited experience and training. ""When you start working there, you're just kind of thrown in,"" she says, adding: ""It's harder to teach children with complex needs than it is to teach typically developing children."" She says during her time at Leaways, access to therapies was limited. For example, there was one part-time counsellor to support some 50 children with social, emotional and mental health needs. She says children in the mainstream school where she now works ""have better access to therapy"". ""This very high fee-paying school is just not meeting the need."" Leaways emphasises thatOfsted's latest report,,externalpublished in March, says the school's leaders ""ensure standards are met consistently"", that children are ""well supervised"" and staff supervision is ""proportionate and appropriate"". ""We are also regularly visited for quality assurance by the local authorities who place children with us, who have also raised no concerns of any kind. ""No school is perfect and all have faced challenges as a result of Covid-19. ""Leaways has faced the dual challenges of both the pandemic and an industrial dispute. ""Where improvements are required, we are actively working with parents, our colleagues and all parties to make positive changes and progress wherever they are needed."" A long-running dispute over pay and conditions ended recently with a deal between Leaways and the National Education Union.

"Riley was one of the students whose photo was altered (Image courtesy of family) A Florida high school is facing a backlash for altering the yearbook photos of 80 female students to add clothing to their chests and shoulders. The school district told local media the changes were made to ensure the photos met the dress code, which says girls' shirts must be ""modest"". But critics pointed to yearbook photos of male students left unedited despite violating the same standards. The digital alterations were made without permission, the students say. Bartram Trail High School's yearbook co-ordinator - a female teacher - made the decision to edit the photos after determining they had violated the dress code, the St Johns County school district said. A disclaimer on Bartram Trail's website warns students that their yearbook photos may be digitally edited to be consistent with the dress code. But some students have called the alterations distressing and accused the school of sexism. ""The double standard in the yearbook is more so that they looked at our body and thought just a little bit of skin showing was sexual,"" Bartram Trail student Riley O'Keefe, 15, told CBS affiliate WJAX News. ""But then they looked at the boys, for the swim team photos and other sports photos and thought that was fine, and that's really upsetting and uncomfortable."" A US high school (stock image) In a statement to WJAX, the district said the school's previous policy was to remove all photos that violated the dress code, and this year's edits were to make sure all students were included. Following the criticism, Bartram Trail, a government-run high school near Jacksonville with about 2,500 students, has said they will issue refunds for the $100 (Â£70) yearbook to parents upset by the changes. The district's dress code for the 2020-2021 school year says that girls' tops and shirts ""must cover the entire shoulder"" and must be ""modest and not revealing or distracting"". ""Excessive make-up"" is not permitted and all students are prohibited from donning ""extreme hairstyles"". Enforcement of the dress code differs between schools, according to the district. How breaking dress codes pays off Why do workplace dress codes persist? The end of high heel dress codes in BC? Bartram Trail's application of these rules stirred local controversy earlier this year when 31 students received dress code violations in a single day. Several of the female students - around 15 and 16 years old - said at the time they were asked to unzip their sweaters and jackets in front of teachers and other students to reveal tank tops and bras underneath. In response, Riley created an online petition asking for changes to the dress code which, she says, ""is clearly based on the sexualisation of young women"". With the code making national headlines again, the petition now has more than 5,000 signatures. US dress codes have been criticised in recent years, with some saying they are applied in ways that shame young women and girls about their bodies. Allow Twitter content?

A 2018 study in Washington, DC, by the National Women's Law Center found that black girls and students with curvier bodies were disproportionately targeted. Riley's mother, Stephanie Fabre, told the BBC the incident ""drew attention to something that wasn't a problem to begin with"". ""Nobody would have looked at that yearbook and looked at these pictures and thought anything of them other than they were beautiful ninth graders,"" she says. ""Some of these edits have drawn mass bullying and emotional stress on some of these girls, because their pictures were so poorly photoshopped that they're being used as memes now and circulating on Snapchat, and that's horrible."" Ms Fabre added that some families are demanding an apology from the school, changes to the dress code and a reissue of the yearbooks with the original photos. But not all parents are against the rules. Another Bartram mother, Rachel D'aquin, told WJAX that she approved of the edits.

"A Belarusian opposition journalist was detained after his flight to Lithuania was diverted to Belarus Roman Protasevich, 26, was on a Ryanair flight from Athens which was rerouted to Minsk He and his girlfriend were arrested in Minsk - three other passengers left the plane Ryanair CEO suggests the other three may have been agents of the Belarusian KGB Belarus says the flight to Vilnius was diverted because of a bomb threat from Palestinian militant group Hamas UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab calls the flight diversion a ""reckless and dangerous"" breach of international law A video has emerged in which Protasevich appears to confess to several crimes - but activists say he was under duress Meanwhile, the European Union agrees to impose more sanctions on Belarus and calls on airlines to avoid the country's airspace Edited by Patrick Jackson The day after Belarus forced a flight to land in Minsk - where authorities detained an opposition journalist and his partner - the EU has agreed to impose more sanctions against the country amid growing international condemnation of the move. You can read the full story of what happened to flight FR4978 and all the reactionhere. Thanks for following our coverage. This live page was edited by Alix Kroeger and Patrick Jackson. The writers were Victoria Bisset, Joshua Cheetham, Toby Luckhurst, Ashitha Nagesh, Joshua Nevett and Gareth Evans. The EU agreed to more sanctions against Belarus on Monday, but there will be more reaction to Ryanair flight FR4978 in the days to come. Belarus's President Alexander Lukashenko is set to deliver a statement on Tuesday on the plane diversion and the arrest of opposition journalist Roman Protasevich. There will also be a meeting of Nato ambassadors to discuss the incident. Belarus is bordered by several Nato members, including Poland, Latvia and Lithuania. We reported earlier that Sofia Sapega, Roman Protasevich's girlfriend, has also been detained. The 23-year-old student was also travelling on the Ryanair flight from Athens to Vilnius when it was diverted to Minsk. Sapega's mother, Anna Dudich, told BBC Russian today that her daughter was in Okrestina Detention Centre, a jail in the Belarusian capital. It is still unclear what the allegations are against her. Her university,the European Humanities University in Vilnius, has called for her immediate release,external. ""We stay in solidarity with all illegally detained Belarusians and those under unprecedented political persecution,"" it said. ""We protest against the unjustified detention of the member of EHU community Sofia Sapega."" The Bolivian president's jet was forced to divert to Vienna in 2013 Western nations have furiously criticised the Belarusian government for diverting the Ryanair flight, and are already proposing measures to punish the state. But a Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman has accused Western leaders of hypocrisy. In a statement, Maria Zakharova said that nations ""had reacted differently
to similar events which took place in other countries earlier"", citing particularly an incident in 2013. Then-Bolivian President Evo Morales' plane ""en
route from Moscow was forced to land in Vienna following a demand by the US
security services which were trying to hunt down former CIA agent E. Snowden"", she alleged. That year US whistleblower Edward Snowden leaked National Security Agency classified information about global surveillance programmes. He fled the country and sought asylum in various countries worldwide, eventually settling in Russia, where he remains today. The BBC covered the incident back in 2013, when the Bolivian jet was reportedly refused entry to French, Spanish and Italian air space and forced to land in Austria. It was allegedly because of US suspicions Snowden was on board - Bolivian officials accused European countries of blocking the presidential jet on behalf of the US, after Morales suggested he could give asylum to Snowden.  Several airlines have halted flights over Belarus KLM, the flag carrier of the Netherlands, is the latest airline to temporarily suspend flights over Belarus in response to Sunday's plane diversion. The move was reported by Dutch news agency ANP shortly after Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte urged to airlines to avoid Belarusian airspace. Other airlines such as Latvia's AirBaltic and Germany's Lufthansa have heeded Rutte's appeal. The international community is still considering what action to take against Belarus for its interception of the Ryanair flight. Earlier, the UN said an urgent council meeting of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) will be convened on Thursday. On Sunday the ICAO, which supports governments in their diplomacy and co-operation in air transport, said the incident may have contravened a core aviation treaty. However, aviation experts say the ICAO has no power to close or restrict a country's airspace, as it is not a regulator. Instead, EU leaders are expected to call on ICAO to urgently investigate the incident in Belarus. We know that the European Council has called for further EU sanctions against Belarus and its government but Belarus has already been under sanctions since 2004. The European Council previously imposed ""an arms embargo; a ban on the export of goods for internal repression; an asset freeze; and a travel ban against four people listed in connection with the unresolved disappearances of two opposition politicians, one businessman and one journalist in 1999 and in 2000,""the Council says,external. The most recent measures,externalwere imposed after the 2020 presidential election, which saw President Lukashenko re-elected amid widespread allegations of fraud. A brutal state crackdown followed, with mass demonstrations on the streets and thousands of arrests. Lukashenko, his son, and 86 other individuals are ""identified as responsible for repression and intimidation"", the European Council says, and are subject to a travel ban and an asset freeze. More now on the video that has emerged showing Protasevich in detention. It has prompted criticism from leading activists, who have suggested it may have been recorded under duress. ""This is how Raman looks under physical and moral pressure,"" the main opposition leader, Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, wrote on Twitter using the Belarusian spelling of his name. ""I demand the immediate release of Raman and all political
prisoners,"" she added. In the clip, Protasevich says he is in a pre-trial
detention facility in Minsk and denies having heart problems that were reported earlier today. He also appears to have a small black spot on his forehead. The European Council, which represents the governments of the EU's member states, has demanded the release of detained opposition journalist Roman Protasevich and his partner, Sofia Sapega, in Belarus.

Belarusian MiG-29 jets at a fly-past (file image) Reuters news agency has been speaking to aviation experts and pilots about the protocol of flight interceptions. Earlier, the head of Belarus's aviation authority said air traffic controllers had not pressured the Ryanair crew to land in Minsk. But one former pilot for US Airways, John Cox, told Reuters the captain of the Ryanair flight had had little choice but to comply. ""If the interceptor directed the Ryanair flight to Minsk, then they had to land there,"" Cox said. ""Pilots are trained for this, and there are internationally agreed signals between the interceptor and the airliner."" One pilot at a European airline said they wouldn't question an interception, while another said ""you don't start a discussion with a MiG-29"", referring to the military fighter jet that pursued the Ryanair plane. Further details of President Volodymyr Zelensky's reported decision have yet to be confirmed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has instructed his government to ""work out a decision"" on suspending air links to and from neighbouring Belarus. Zelensky gave the order at a meeting with senior members of his government,according to a government release.,external An extraordinary meeting of senior Ukrainian leaders will be held tomorrow to discuss the order, AFP news agency reports. The two former Soviet Union countries share a 891km (554-mile) border in eastern Europe. Relations have cooled in recent years. Shortly after Alexander Lukashenko's contentious re-election in August 2020, Ukraine recalled its ambassador to Belarus, saying that it had to assess the prospect of their relations ""in the new reality."" Ukraine has also criticised Belarus for returning a group of alleged military contractors back to Russia, shortly after they were arrested in Minsk. Lukashenko said the men had worked for a Russian mercenary company called Wagner Group, and had plotted to overthrow him. At the time, Zelensky called for the men to be sent to Ukraine so they could be prosecuted for their alleged involvement in the war in eastern Ukraine. Welcome to our live coverage of the unfolding row surrounding Ryanair flight FR4978. On Sunday the Belarusian authorities diverted the plane to land in Minsk and arrested opposition journalist Roman Protasevich on board.  In the last few moments a video has emerged in which opposition journalist Roman Protasevich apparently confesses to crimes he has been charged with by the Belarusian state. In the video Protasevich says he's being treated well in jail and that reports of heart problems are false. It was not immediately possible to verify whether the words were his own and had not been recorded under duress. The video appeared after an unconfirmed report circulated that he was in hospital in critical condition with heart disease. Protasevich is being held in a detention centre in Minsk, according to Belarus's interior ministry. An ardent opponent of Belarus's president, Protasevich was put on the country's list of ""individuals involved in terrorist activity"" for his role in mass protests last year. The charge of causing mass unrest can be punished by up to 15 years in jail. Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko has been in power since 1994 Belarusâs long-time president Alexander Lukashenko is a central character in this rapidly escalating incident of international concern. On Sunday,state media in Belarus said,externalPresident Lukashenko had personally given the order to divert the Ryanair flight to Minsk. Since winning a disputed presidential election last August, Lukashenko, 66, who has ruled the country since 1994, has cracked down on dissenting voices. A former Soviet state farm director, Lukashenko was first elected president in 1994. A 1996 referendum gave the president greatly increased powers at the expense of parliament. But his latest attempt at prolonging his rule was met with mass street protests in August 2020, demanding that he step down after an election that the opposition said was rigged. Over the years, several opposition politicians who might have provided leadership have disappeared or been imprisoned. Insulting the president, even in jest, carries a prison sentence. For this authoritarian style of rule, Lukashenko is often referred to as Europe's last dictator. The UK government has told airlines to avoid Belarusian airspace after the diversion of the Ryanair flight. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps tweeted that the move was necessary ""to keep passengers safe"". Mr Shapps said he has also suspended the operating permit of Belarus' state airline, Belavia, effectively banning it from the UK. The airline's timetable shows it operates a three-times weekly flight from Minsk to London's Gatwick airport.  Britain says carriers should by-pass Belarus after a flight was diverted to Minsk and a journalist held. Roman Protasevich, the opposition journalist who was arrested after his flight was diverted to Belarus, is being held in a detention centre in the capital Minsk, the country's interior ministry says. In a statement shared with state media,external, the ministry said Protasevich had not complained of ill health while in custody. Earlier his father, Dmitry, told the BBC that he feared his son may be tortured in custody, and could face the death penalty. Protasevich is wanted in connection with last year's mass protests against the authoritarian president of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko. Several airlines have said their planes will not fly over Belarus Several international airlines have said they will avoid Belarus's air space after the diversion of the flight. Those airlines include: Some governments have advised airlines not to fly their planes over Belarusian airspace. UK Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said he had instructed the UK Civil Aviation Authority to request airlines ""avoid Belarusian airspace in order to keep passengers safe"". Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky went a step further. He ordered the government to stop direct flights in and out of Belarus. Further restrictions on flights through Belarus may be announced following a meeting of EU leaders this evening. Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission, has spoken to journalists ahead of a special EU summit, where sanctions against Belarus will be discussed. In a video posted on Twitter Ms von der Leyen condemned what she called the ""utterly
unacceptable hijacking of a Ryanair flight"". ""There will be a very strong answer. Because it is outrageous
behaviour and Lukashenko and his regime have to understand that this will have
severe consequences,"" she said. She explained sanctions on individuals, companies and Belarus's aviation sector were all under discussion, adding that they were also putting pressure on the regime to immediately release journalist Roman Protasevich. And she ended by saying that there was a â¬3bn ($3.7bn; Â£2.6bn) economic and investment package for Belarus from the EU ""ready to go"". ""That
is on hold and frozen until Belarus turns democratic,"" she said. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

UN Secretary-General  AntÃ³nio Guterres said he was concerned about the incident International pressure for an international investigation of the flight diversion in Belarus is growing by the minute. UN Secretary-General AntÃ³nio Guterres says he is ""deeply concerned"" by the interception of the plane and arrest of the dissident journalist by Belarus. ""The secretary general supports calls for a full, transparent and independent investigation into this disturbing incident and urges all relevant actors to cooperate with such an inquiry,"" his spokesman StÃ©phane Dujarric says in a statement. As we reported earlier, Belarus has, via its foreign minister, suggested it would allow ""international specialists"" to ""transparently investigate this incident"". But, given the political acrimony surrounding this incident, what Belarus and western European countries deem to be a transparent investigation could be quite far apart. Before he was detained in Minsk, opposition journalist Roman Protasevich is said to have told a fellow passenger: ""A death penalty awaits me here."" So how realistic is that fear? Belarus is the only country in Europe and the former Soviet Union that still passes and carries out death sentences. Although no prisoners were executed last year, two were killed in 2019, according to Amnesty International. Last year, Protasevich tweeted that his name had appeared on a list of terror suspects in Belarus - and terrorism charges can carry the death penalty,Al Jazeera reports. Journalists have faced deteriorating conditions in the country. Earlier this year, media freedom organisationReporters Without Borders (RSF) urged the UN to investigate the ""persecution of journalists"",externalin its investigation into the Belarusian government's post-eleciton crackdown, after two reporters said they were tortured in detention. And Belarus fell five places to 158 out of 180 countries on RSF's World Press Freedom Index. The Committee to Protect Journalists, meanwhile, has spoken of its shock at Protasevich's detention,  ""even as President Aleksandr Lukashenkoâs government has increasingly strangled the press in Belarus for the past year, detaining, fining, and expelling journalists and sentencing them to longer and longer prison terms"".

"This video can not be played Roman Protasevich's father tells the BBC he is fearful his son may be tortured The father of a journalist who was arrested after his flight was diverted to Belarus has told the BBC he fears his son may be tortured. Roman Protasevich, 26, was on a flight from Greece which was rerouted to Minsk on Sunday over a supposed bomb threat. Western countries accused Belarus of ""hijacking"" the Ryanair plane in order to arrest the dissident reporter. A video has also emerged of Mr Protasevich that appears to have been recorded under duress. In the clip, which was released late on Monday, the journalist said he was in good health and seemingly confessed to crimes he had been charged with by the Belarusian state. But activists, including the country's main opposition leader, criticised the video and suggested Mr Protasevich was under pressure to admit wrongdoing. Belarus plane: Who is dissident Roman Protasevich? What action can the EU take? The journalist's father, Dmitri Protasevich, told the BBC on Monday that he was ""really afraid"" of how his son would be treated by the authorities in his home country. ""We hope that he will cope. We are afraid to even think about it, but it's possible he could be beaten and tortured. We are really afraid of that,"" he said in a video call. ""We are really shocked and really upset,"" he said. ""This sort of thing shouldn't be happening in the 21st Century at the heart of Europe. ""We hope that the whole international community, including the European Union, will put unprecedented pressure on the authorities. We hope the pressure will work and the authorities will realise they've made a really big mistake."" Shortly after the footage of Mr Protasevich was released, the European Union said it had agreed to impose more sanctions on Belarus. It also called on airlines to avoid the country's airspace and gave the go-ahead to banning Belarusian airlines from flying over EU territory. The plane landed in Vilnius more than six hours after its scheduled arrival Belarus sent a fighter jet to force flight FR4978 - which had departed from the Greek capital, Athens, and was bound for Lithuania - to land, claiming a bomb threat. It touched down in the capital Minsk at 13:16 local time (10:16 GMT) on Sunday. Police then took Mr Protasevich away when the plane's 126 passengers disembarked. The activist, who witnesses said was ""super scared"", was arrested along with his girlfriend Sofia Sapega. Ms Sapega's mother told the BBC that the 23-year-old had been taken to a Minsk jail, adding that the last word she managed to write on her WhatsApp messaging account was 'Mummy'. The accusations against her are unclear. Belarus is the only European country that still executes prisoners, and witnesses said Mr Protasevich told fellow passengers he feared he would face the death penalty. Three other passengers did not reach the plane's final destination, which was the Lithuanian capital Vilnius. Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary said he believed some Belarusian KGB agents also departed the plane at Minsk, but this has not been independently verified. Belarus said the flight had been diverted because of a bomb threat from the Palestinian militant group Hamas. A senior transport official read a letter to reporters that he claimed was from the militant group. ""If you do not fulfil our demands, the bomb will explode over Vilnius,"" it said. But Hamas has denied any involvement. The group has no history or known capability of mounting operations outside Israel and the Palestinian territories. German leader Chancellor Angela Merkel said the Belarusian claim was ""completely implausible"". The incident has drawn sharp condemnation from across the world, with countries urging the immediate release of Mr Protasevich and a full investigation. Dozens of Belarusian officials, including President Alexander Lukashenko, are already under EU sanctions including travel bans and asset freezes, imposed in response to the repression on opponents. Passengers describe panic on plane Why wearing the wrong socks is risky in Belarus How messenger app bypassed Belarus news blackout State media in Belarus said Mr Lukashenko, who has ruled the country since 1994, personally gave the order for the plane to be diverted. The 66-year-old leader has cracked down on dissenting voices since winning a disputed election last August. Many opposition figures have been arrested, while others fled into exile. Mr Protasevich is a former editor of Nexta, a media operation with a Telegram channel. He left Belarus in 2019 to live in exile in Lithuania. From there he covered the events of the 2020 presidential election, after which he was charged with terrorism and inciting riots. Nexta played a key role for the opposition during the vote, which was won by Mr Lukashenko and is widely regarded as rigged.

"This video can not be played Roman Protasevich's father tells the BBC he is fearful his son may be tortured The father of a journalist who was arrested after his flight was diverted to Belarus has told the BBC he fears his son may be tortured. Roman Protasevich, 26, was on a flight from Greece which was rerouted to Minsk on Sunday over a supposed bomb threat. Western countries accused Belarus of ""hijacking"" the Ryanair plane in order to arrest the dissident reporter. A video has also emerged of Mr Protasevich that appears to have been recorded under duress. In the clip, which was released late on Monday, the journalist said he was in good health and seemingly confessed to crimes he had been charged with by the Belarusian state. But activists, including the country's main opposition leader, criticised the video and suggested Mr Protasevich was under pressure to admit wrongdoing. Belarus plane: Who is dissident Roman Protasevich? What action can the EU take? The journalist's father, Dmitri Protasevich, told the BBC on Monday that he was ""really afraid"" of how his son would be treated by the authorities in his home country. ""We hope that he will cope. We are afraid to even think about it, but it's possible he could be beaten and tortured. We are really afraid of that,"" he said in a video call. ""We are really shocked and really upset,"" he said. ""This sort of thing shouldn't be happening in the 21st Century at the heart of Europe. ""We hope that the whole international community, including the European Union, will put unprecedented pressure on the authorities. We hope the pressure will work and the authorities will realise they've made a really big mistake.""

"The UK's third largest steel maker, Liberty Steel, has announced plans to sell off its Stocksbridge steel plant as part of a restructuring plan. It says the move will allow it to pay back one of its main creditors in full. The announcement comes after a meeting over the weekend in Dubai between Liberty boss Sanjeev Gupta and representatives of Credit Suisse. The investment bank lost more than Â£1bn when Mr Gupta's main financial backer Greensill Capital went bust in March. Mr Gupta is now struggling to finance his UK operations, and 5,000 steel jobs at Liberty hang in the balance. His global steel business, GFG Alliance, is also under investigation by the UK's Serious Fraud Office. Liberty Steel in Â£18m loan breach with Metro Bank Gupta empire facing UK fraud probe over Greensill Credit Suisse have agreed to pause their court proceedings against Mr Gupta's empire while the sale of Stocksbridge is conducted. The sale will also include Stocksbridge's downstream plants, which include the narrow strip mill at Brinsworth, and Performance Steels at West Bromwich which will be launched shortly. Sanjeev Gupta owns Liberty Steel, part of the GFG Alliance The aerospace industry is a major customer of the Stocksbridge plant and the acute distress in that industry has seen demand for steel made at Stocksbridge plummet. Sources close to Liberty Steel conceded that it was not clear what, if any, value would be realised in a sale. They also said they were looking at other options apart from an outright sale including joint ventures with third parties. However, offloading Stocksbridge would reduce the demands on the capital of the overall group and might therefore be attractive to creditors like Credit Suisse. The move would allow Liberty to focus on its Rotherham plant which recycles scrap steel into new. Sources close to Credit Suisse described the developments as ""inching towards a solution"". However, Liberty Steel insiders conceded that the launching of investigations into the relationship between Liberty and its now-defunct backer, Greensill, by both the Serious Fraud Office and the Financial Conduct Authority were complications in refinancing the UK's third largest steel maker. A spokesperson for the National Trade Union Steel Coordinating Committee, said: ""Stocksbridge and its downstream plants are strategically important businesses vital to our country's defence, energy and aerospace sectors. ""The future for these businesses must be secured and the trade unions will hold Sanjeev Gupta to his promise that none of our steel plants will close on his watch. ""Liberty must act as a responsible seller and run a transparent sales process which fully engages the trade unions. We will expect to meet any potential buyer to scrutinise their plans and test their commitment to the workforce and our industry."" The Labour Party said the government should ensure Stocksbridge remained open, arguing the government should have a ""plan B"" in case the sale failed to secure the plant's future. ""Public ownership must remain an option on the table,"" said shadow business secretary Ed Miliband. Labour metro mayor for the Sheffield City Region Dan Jarvis said the government should be ""prepared to help provide finance to bridge any transition period until a new buyer is found"". In a series of comments on social media, business secretary Kwasi Kwarteng wrote that he was ""monitoring developments closely"". ""There is a future for steel-making in the UK, and I remain committed to supporting the sector's low-carbon transition to protect high-quality jobs,"" he wrote on Twitter. ""I'll be meeting the company, trade unions and local MPs over the coming days.""

"Paul Farrell targeted his victims between 1985 and 2020, committing offences at addresses across London A Great Ormond Street Hospital porter who befriended the parents of his young victims to allow him to abuse boys across London has been jailed for life. Paul Farrell, 55, kept a diary of threats and bribes used to keep one of the children under control, Wood Green Crown Court heard. Farrell admitted 76 offences against eight victims, from 1985 to 2020. He must spend at least 18 years in jail. He used an area of the hospital for abuse but did not target patients. Prosecutors linked Farrell, of Camden, north London, to at least 500 instances of abuse, although they estimate the true figure is ""likely to be in the thousands"". His 35-year campaign of abuse included attempted rape, sexual assault of a child under 13 and making indecent photographs of children. Farrell worked at Great Ormond Street Hospital between 1994 and 2020 Farrell, who pleaded guilty at a previous hearing, acted as a babysitter to people he had befriended in order to gain access to their children. He kept a diary of threats and bribes made to one of his victims, who was aged 12 when the abuse began. To stop the boy from telling anyone about the attacks, Farrell hid a camera in the boy's room. Prosecutors said Farrell had ""groomed"" the entire family to enable him to abuse the boy and his two younger brothers, setting reminders to buy members of the family presents or to offer himself as a babysitter. Another victim, who was five years old when the abuse began, told Farrell in court: ""Innocent children like me and my brother will be profoundly scarred by your actions for the rest of our lives. ""I now feel hopeless, lost and disgusted at my silence that has allowed you to ruin the lives of so many innocent children."" Paul Farrell was sentenced to a minimum term of 18 years in prison at Wood Green Crown Court Judge Noel Lucas said Farrell had a ""deep-seated fixation with sexual activity with very young boys"". The judge said: ""It is difficult to fully comprehend the fear, confusion and vulnerabilities your young victims must have suffered as you repeatedly used and abused them to satisfy your sexual desires. ""For the whole of your adult life you have pursued your predatory interest in committing intimate sexual acts with very young boys with an all-consuming determination, irrespective of their attempts to make you desist."" A Great Ormond Street Hospital spokesman said: ""Our thoughts remain with the brave victims and their families whose stories have been shared in court. ""While we have heard in court that Paul Farrell did not target children at GOSH, his association with our hospital is distressing for the hospital community. ""We are deeply sorry that he was able to exploit his position and use our hospital to commit some of his crimes. ""Our safeguarding practices will remain rigorous and under regular review and we are actively considering whether anything more can be done to prevent crimes like this.""

"Mhari O'Neill's body was discovered on Edinburgh's Calton Hill in December 2018 A man has admitted killing a schoolgirl after buying her alcohol and abandoning her on Edinburgh's Calton Hill. Ewan Fulton, who was 18 at the time, bit and throttled Mhari O'Neill, 15, before leaving her on Edinburgh's Calton Hill on 7 December 2018. Her body was found by a dog walker. Hypothermia, with intoxication, was said to be the most probable reason for her death. Fulton, now aged 20, was remanded in custody at the High Court in Edinburgh. He will be sentenced next month following background reports. The court heard that Fulton met Mhari through social media site Yubo. Before they met, he sent her a message which read: ""It is freezing today should've worn my pimp coat"". In a later message he wrote: ""Ur gonna freeze to death OMG."" After she was found dead he told police he was aware Mhari was 15 years old. He said he had bought a large bottle of vodka for them to share after he travelled to Edinburgh from Livingston to meet her. Ewan Fulton was aged 18 at the time of the killing Fulton told police Mhari had been so intoxicated that she kept falling off a bench and could not walk. He claimed he was starting to panic and knew he needed to get the last train home. He maintained he told her several times he was leaving, but did not get a response as she was ""unable to speak"". The following day the shop worker sent her a text stating: ""Are you alive?"" He said he was ""freaking out"" because he had not heard from her. Advocate depute Alex Prentice told the court after his meeting with Mhari, Fulton had texted a friend the next day. In a message he wrote: ""I had no choice but to leave, what was I supposed to do?"" and ""I got her drunk she's 15"". He told another friend: ""That girl has a family and if I had stayed she would be alive."" Mr Prentice said pathologists considered hypothermia, with intoxication, was the most probable reason for the Portobello High School pupil's death. Fulton pleaded guilty to culpable homicide. He admitted taking part in sexual activity with the schoolgirl, culpably and recklessly endangering her health and life, and exposing her to risk of injury and death. He had provided her with alcohol which resulted in her becoming intoxicated and incapable of looking after herself. Fulton, from Livingston, West Lothian, abandoned the girl ""in a remote and exposed location"" in a state of partial undress without means to contact anyone and failed to seek help for her. The culpable homicide charge stated he behaved with ""utter disregard"" for the consequences of his actions towards her. In impact statements, Mhari's parents described her as ""a much-loved daughter"". Mhari had asked her mother, Donna O'Neill, if she could go to the city's Christmas market with a friend. Her mother agreed and told her she had to be home by 21:00. When she failed to return home her family began looking for her and contacted her friends, before reporting her to police as a missing person at about midnight. Det Insp Susan Balfour from Police Scotland's major investigation team said: ""This has been a distressing time for Mhari's family and our thoughts remain with them and her friends. ""We welcome the conviction of Ewan Fulton and hope it brings some comfort to Mhari's loved ones.""

There are reports in India that a couple chartered a plane to hold a mid-air wedding with more than 160 guests in an effort to escape Covid restrictions. Video footage posted on social media appearsto show the couple and their guests packed into a hired jet. The state of Tamil Nadu, where the flight is said to have originated, recently imposed tougher restrictions, limiting weddings to 50 guests. India's aviation authority has launched an investigation, reports say. An official from the Directorate General of Civil Aviation tells the Times of India the SpiceJet staff aboard the flight had been taken off duty. A SpiceJet spokesperson tells the Indian Express the Boeing 737 was booked from Madurai to Bangalore by a travel agent for a trip after a wedding.

The London Blossom Garden at the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park in Stratford, east London, commemorates Londoners who have died during the pandemic. It features 33 blossom trees to represent the 32 London Boroughs and the City of London. To mark the opening Sadiq Khan is announcing the launch of a bereavement support programme that will direct people to advice and support and that will begin with a public awareness campaign. He says the garden will be a lasting living memorial to the more than 19,000 Londoners who have died during the pandemic. ""It continues to be an incredibly difficult time for Londoners as we battle the virus, and I want all those who have experienced loss to know that there is support available to them,"" he says. ""Nothing will make losing someone you love any easier, but we want Londoners to know they are not alone. We are here for you, as a city."" More than 250 pupils are isolating after 26 people tested positive for coronavirus at a Welsh school. In total 267 out of about 400 pupils have been sent home from West Park Primary, in Porthcawl, south Wales. Bridgend Council says parents have ""been advised to remain alert"" and online learning is being arranged. A spokesman says four staff and 22 pupils had tested positive. They say ""all staff and most pupils"" in year one were affected. There were also cases among pupils ""in nursery, reception, year two and year threeâ³, theLocal Democracy Reporting Servicesays. The council says 68 brothers and sisters of the pupils sent home have also been told to isolate, meaning a total of 335 people are home learning. More than 1.5 billion doses of coronavirus vaccines have been administered, in at least 189 countries worldwide. However, there are vast differences in the pace of progress in different parts of the world. The UK, for example, is on the brink of vaccinating its under-30s, while some countries are still waiting for their first shipments. Earlier, the head of the World Health Organization said the unequal distribution of vaccines was ""scandalous"". Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the gap was making the global pandemic worse - and that 75% of all doses have gone to just 10 countries. Many poorer countries are relying on deliveries from Covax. Dr Tedros has told rich countries to start donating some of their doses now - rather than waiting for surplus - and asked pharmaceutical companies to give the WHO first refusal on all new batches of vaccine. The aim is to vaccinate 10% of every countryâs population by September, he says. Read more about vaccination worldwide here. People ""should be worried"" about a resurgence in Covid, the Welsh government's chief medical officer says. Dr Frank Atherton says a spike in the Indian variant to ""around 57"" cases from 28 last Thursday is ""something we need to watch very carefully"". He says most of these cases were in Cardiff and the Vale of Glamorgan, although they have been identified in all health board areas apart from Powys. He says measures such as social distancing and using face coverings were ""the things that keep us safe"" and there was a risk the situation could ""go into reverse"" if those measures were relaxed. ""The public should be worried about the resurgence in coronavirus in general really,"" he says. ""We have a small number of cases - 57 at the moment of the so-called Indian variant - but that will be an underestimate and I expect the numbers to rise."" Read more. About half the people who were due to get a Covid jab at a mass vaccination centre in Glasgow failed to turn up over the weekend. The BBC has learned a ""considerable"" number of no shows were recorded on both Saturday and Sunday at the Hydro. The venue can administer a minimum of 4,000 vaccinations each day, with a capacity to scale up to 10,000. Glasgow has the highest coronavirus rates in the country at 133 cases per 100,000 people in the seven days to 20 May. It is the only council area in Scotland under level three Covid restrictions and people aged 18 to 39 in certain postcode areas are being offered jabs early to tackle surging cases.

Vaccinations for that age group - the final one - are expected to begin in mid-June, but a two-week registration period is now open. It means 18 to 29-year-olds will receive digital alerts so they don't miss an invitation to book. Registration is not compulsory and people who don't sign up will still get a vaccine appointment offered through the post, as long as their GP details are up to date.

"Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko, Europe's longest-serving ruler, is facing unprecedented opposition to his power. The 66-year-old former Soviet farm boss claimed a sixth term as president in a widely disputed election on 9 August. He has faced weeks of mass protests against his rule. About 100,000 people have rallied against him weekly in Minsk - by far the biggest opposition protests of his rule. Mr Lukashenko has been in power since 1994, with an authoritarian style reminiscent of the Soviet era, controlling the main media channels, harassing and jailing political opponents and marginalising independent voices. The country's powerful secret police - still called the KGB - closely monitors dissidents. Political novice Svetlana Tikhanovskaya is now Mr Lukashenko's main political rival. She stepped in to challenge him for the presidency after her husband Sergei Tikhanovsky, a popular blogger, was barred from running and sent to jail. On 30 July a huge crowd rallied in support of Svetlana Tikhanovskaya She claims to have won 60-70% in places where votes were properly counted - but the president claimed a landslide victory. None of the previous presidential elections held during Mr Lukashenko's long reign were ever judged free and fair by the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), a top election monitoring body. The mother challenging Belarus's longtime ruler Belarus ban on election challengers stirs protests Why does Lukashenko take son Kolya to work? But the latest vote, and subsequent crackdown with thousands arrested, has sparked the widest condemnation yet. Major opposition figures, including Ms Tikhanovskaya, are now in exile in neighbouring countries, amid a wave of arrests. For years Mr Lukashenko has sought to convince the nation of 9.5 million that he is the best guarantor of stability, a tough nationalist protecting them from foreign meddling. That message still appeals to many older Belarusians. The country was devastated in World War Two - victim of a Nazi scorched-earth policy - and lost nearly one-third of its population. So suspicion of foreigners and pride in the security forces play well among many voters. Victory parade defies pandemic and upstages Putin Back in 2005 the administration of then US President George W Bush called Belarus ""the last remaining true dictatorship in the heart of Europe"". Mr Lukashenko once warned that anyone joining an opposition protest would be treated as a ""terrorist"", adding: ""We will wring their necks, as one might a duck"". This video can not be played Activists and journalists were rounded up and jailed in Belarus before the election In recent years, however, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orban have also drawn strong Western criticism for harassing opponents and extending state power. Coronavirus has added an extra dimension to the political ferment in Belarus. Opponents consider Mr Lukashenko's bravado about the virus to be reckless and a sign that he is out of touch. In late May he said Belarus was right not to lock down. ""You see that in the affluent West, unemployment is out of control. People are banging on pots. People want to eat. Thank God, we avoided this. We didn't shut down."" In March, as countries across Europe were imposing lockdowns, he said: ""I am convinced that we may suffer more from panic than from the virus"". He suggested combating the virus with hard work, the sauna and vodka. When the rest of Europe cancelled football matches the continuing Belarus fixtures - still drawing big crowds to stadiums - suddenly attracted international interest. Belarus league plays on amid coronavirus In February Mr Lukashenko (C) played against Mr Putin (L) in a friendly ice hockey match in Sochi, Russia Before the election Mr Lukashenko's security chiefs accused unnamed Russian forces of trying to help his opponents and foment unrest. Russia remains Belarus's chief ally - they have held joint military exercises and the struggling Belarus economy relies on trade with its powerful neighbour. But in recent years relations have cooled since Moscow moved to end subsidised oil and gas supplies. Belarus authorities arrested 33 Russians near Minsk - all but one at a sanatorium - in July and said they belonged to Wagner, a shadowy Russian mercenary group active in Ukraine, Africa and the Middle East. Russia denied the Belarusian claim that the detained Russians were plotting acts of terrorism, insisting that they were actually in transit, waiting for a flight to Istanbul. They were later released. Belarus accuses 'Russian mercenaries' of plot A former Soviet state farm director, Mr Lukashenko became president in 1994 after leading an anti-corruption drive in parliament. In the August 1991 botched coup attempt against then Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, Mr Lukashenko supported the communist hardliners. Like Vladimir Putin, Mr Lukashenko remains nostalgic for the Soviet Union. And both are keen ice hockey players. This video can not be played A rare audience with Belarus' President Alexander Lukashenko A referendum in 2004 lifted the two-term limit on presidents, making it possible for Mr Lukashenko to lead Belarus indefinitely. His origins were humble - raised by a single mother in a poor village in eastern Belarus. He is married to Galina Lukashenko, with whom he has two adult sons, Viktor and Dmitry. He told an interviewer in 2015 that he had no intention of divorcing Galina, although they have not lived together for decades. He has a third son, Nikolai, born in 2004, whose mother Irina Abelskaya was Mr Lukashenko's personal doctor. ""An authoritarian style of rule is characteristic of me, and I have always admitted it,"" he said in August 2003. ""You need to control the country, and the main thing is not to ruin people's lives."" Despite the mass unrest, Mr Lukashenko insists he will not leave office - but has acknowledged some Belarusians might be ""fed up"" with his rule. He said Belarus could not return to the instability of the years following the break-up of the Soviet Union in 1991, and he has twice appeared brandishing a gun during the protests. President Putin says he has formed a police reserve force to intervene in Belarus if necessary - as requested by Mr Lukashenko. Russia could send them in if the protests  got really ""out of control"", Mr Putin said.

There are reports in India that a couple chartered a plane to hold a mid-air wedding with more than 160 guests in an effort to escape Covid restrictions. Video footage posted on social media appearsto show the couple and their guests packed into a hired jet. The state of Tamil Nadu, where the flight is said to have originated, recently imposed tougher restrictions, limiting weddings to 50 guests. India's aviation authority has launched an investigation, reports say. An official from the Directorate General of Civil Aviation tells the Times of India the SpiceJet staff aboard the flight had been taken off duty. A SpiceJet spokesperson tells the Indian Express the Boeing 737 was booked from Madurai to Bangalore by a travel agent for a trip after a wedding. The spokesperson says the client was ""clearly briefed on Covid guidelines to be followed and denied permission for any activity to be performed on board"".

More than 250 pupils are isolating after 26 people tested positive for coronavirus at a Welsh school. In total 267 out of about 400 pupils have been sent home from West Park Primary, in Porthcawl, south Wales. Bridgend Council says parents have ""been advised to remain alert"" and online learning is being arranged. A spokesman says four staff and 22 pupils had tested positive. They say ""all staff and most pupils"" in year one were affected. There were also cases among pupils ""in nursery, reception, year two and year threeâ³, theLocal Democracy Reporting Servicesays. The council says 68 brothers and sisters of the pupils sent home have also been told to isolate, meaning a total of 335 people are home learning. More than 1.5 billion doses of coronavirus vaccines have been administered, in at least 189 countries worldwide. However, there are vast differences in the pace of progress in different parts of the world. The UK, for example, is on the brink of vaccinating its under-30s, while some countries are still waiting for their first shipments. Earlier, the head of the World Health Organization said the unequal distribution of vaccines was ""scandalous"". Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the gap was making the global pandemic worse - and that 75% of all doses have gone to just 10 countries. Many poorer countries are relying on deliveries from Covax. Dr Tedros has told rich countries to start donating some of their doses now - rather than waiting for surplus - and asked pharmaceutical companies to give the WHO first refusal on all new batches of vaccine. The aim is to vaccinate 10% of every countryâs population by September, he says. Read more about vaccination worldwide here. People ""should be worried"" about a resurgence in Covid, the Welsh government's chief medical officer says. Dr Frank Atherton says a spike in the Indian variant to ""around 57"" cases from 28 last Thursday is ""something we need to watch very carefully"". He says most of these cases were in Cardiff and the Vale of Glamorgan, although they have been identified in all health board areas apart from Powys. He says measures such as social distancing and using face coverings were ""the things that keep us safe"" and there was a risk the situation could ""go into reverse"" if those measures were relaxed. ""The public should be worried about the resurgence in coronavirus in general really,"" he says. ""We have a small number of cases - 57 at the moment of the so-called Indian variant - but that will be an underestimate and I expect the numbers to rise."" Read more. About half the people who were due to get a Covid jab at a mass vaccination centre in Glasgow failed to turn up over the weekend. The BBC has learned a ""considerable"" number of no shows were recorded on both Saturday and Sunday at the Hydro. The venue can administer a minimum of 4,000 vaccinations each day, with a capacity to scale up to 10,000. Glasgow has the highest coronavirus rates in the country at 133 cases per 100,000 people in the seven days to 20 May. It is the only council area in Scotland under level three Covid restrictions and people aged 18 to 39 in certain postcode areas are being offered jabs early to tackle surging cases.

"Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko, Europe's longest-serving ruler, is facing unprecedented opposition to his power. The 66-year-old former Soviet farm boss claimed a sixth term as president in a widely disputed election on 9 August. He has faced weeks of mass protests against his rule. About 100,000 people have rallied against him weekly in Minsk - by far the biggest opposition protests of his rule. Mr Lukashenko has been in power since 1994, with an authoritarian style reminiscent of the Soviet era, controlling the main media channels, harassing and jailing political opponents and marginalising independent voices. The country's powerful secret police - still called the KGB - closely monitors dissidents. Political novice Svetlana Tikhanovskaya is now Mr Lukashenko's main political rival. She stepped in to challenge him for the presidency after her husband Sergei Tikhanovsky, a popular blogger, was barred from running and sent to jail. On 30 July a huge crowd rallied in support of Svetlana Tikhanovskaya She claims to have won 60-70% in places where votes were properly counted - but the president claimed a landslide victory. None of the previous presidential elections held during Mr Lukashenko's long reign were ever judged free and fair by the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), a top election monitoring body. The mother challenging Belarus's longtime ruler Belarus ban on election challengers stirs protests Why does Lukashenko take son Kolya to work? But the latest vote, and subsequent crackdown with thousands arrested, has sparked the widest condemnation yet. Major opposition figures, including Ms Tikhanovskaya, are now in exile in neighbouring countries, amid a wave of arrests. For years Mr Lukashenko has sought to convince the nation of 9.5 million that he is the best guarantor of stability, a tough nationalist protecting them from foreign meddling. That message still appeals to many older Belarusians. The country was devastated in World War Two - victim of a Nazi scorched-earth policy - and lost nearly one-third of its population. So suspicion of foreigners and pride in the security forces play well among many voters. Victory parade defies pandemic and upstages Putin Back in 2005 the administration of then US President George W Bush called Belarus ""the last remaining true dictatorship in the heart of Europe"". Mr Lukashenko once warned that anyone joining an opposition protest would be treated as a ""terrorist"", adding: ""We will wring their necks, as one might a duck"". This video can not be played Activists and journalists were rounded up and jailed in Belarus before the election In recent years, however, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orban have also drawn strong Western criticism for harassing opponents and extending state power. Coronavirus has added an extra dimension to the political ferment in Belarus. Opponents consider Mr Lukashenko's bravado about the virus to be reckless and a sign that he is out of touch. In late May he said Belarus was right not to lock down. ""You see that in the affluent West, unemployment is out of control. People are banging on pots. People want to eat. Thank God, we avoided this. We didn't shut down."" In March, as countries across Europe were imposing lockdowns, he said: ""I am convinced that we may suffer more from panic than from the virus"". He suggested combating the virus with hard work, the sauna and vodka. When the rest of Europe cancelled football matches the continuing Belarus fixtures - still drawing big crowds to stadiums - suddenly attracted international interest. Belarus league plays on amid coronavirus In February Mr Lukashenko (C) played against Mr Putin (L) in a friendly ice hockey match in Sochi, Russia Before the election Mr Lukashenko's security chiefs accused unnamed Russian forces of trying to help his opponents and foment unrest. Russia remains Belarus's chief ally - they have held joint military exercises and the struggling Belarus economy relies on trade with its powerful neighbour. But in recent years relations have cooled since Moscow moved to end subsidised oil and gas supplies. Belarus authorities arrested 33 Russians near Minsk - all but one at a sanatorium - in July and said they belonged to Wagner, a shadowy Russian mercenary group active in Ukraine, Africa and the Middle East. Russia denied the Belarusian claim that the detained Russians were plotting acts of terrorism, insisting that they were actually in transit, waiting for a flight to Istanbul. They were later released. Belarus accuses 'Russian mercenaries' of plot A former Soviet state farm director, Mr Lukashenko became president in 1994 after leading an anti-corruption drive in parliament. In the August 1991 botched coup attempt against then Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, Mr Lukashenko supported the communist hardliners. Like Vladimir Putin, Mr Lukashenko remains nostalgic for the Soviet Union. And both are keen ice hockey players. This video can not be played A rare audience with Belarus' President Alexander Lukashenko A referendum in 2004 lifted the two-term limit on presidents, making it possible for Mr Lukashenko to lead Belarus indefinitely. His origins were humble - raised by a single mother in a poor village in eastern Belarus. He is married to Galina Lukashenko, with whom he has two adult sons, Viktor and Dmitry. He told an interviewer in 2015 that he had no intention of divorcing Galina, although they have not lived together for decades. He has a third son, Nikolai, born in 2004, whose mother Irina Abelskaya was Mr Lukashenko's personal doctor. ""An authoritarian style of rule is characteristic of me, and I have always admitted it,"" he said in August 2003. ""You need to control the country, and the main thing is not to ruin people's lives."" Despite the mass unrest, Mr Lukashenko insists he will not leave office - but has acknowledged some Belarusians might be ""fed up"" with his rule. He said Belarus could not return to the instability of the years following the break-up of the Soviet Union in 1991, and he has twice appeared brandishing a gun during the protests. President Putin says he has formed a police reserve force to intervene in Belarus if necessary - as requested by Mr Lukashenko. Russia could send them in if the protests  got really ""out of control"", Mr Putin said.

"Jessica Banfield (centre) was able to hold her grandmother Iola's hand on Monday Many families and friends are now able to visit loved ones inside care homes in Wales and hold their hand for the first time in over a year. Until Monday, only two designated visitors could make visits indoors, due to Welsh government guidance. Now,changes in guidance allow anyone to visit,external, but residents can only see two people at a time. ""You do worry they may catch it and you may never see them again,"" said Jessica Banfield, who visited her grandmother. Ms Banfield went to see Iola Roberts, 87, at the Old Vicarage care home in Llangollen, Denbighshire, and described the anguish her family felt not being able to spend either her birthday or Christmas with her in 2020. Praising staff, she added: ""They've had to take on that extra role of being family for them and supporting us saying 'they're OK, they're happy', because you feel such distance."" The family are now looking forward to celebrating Iola's 88th birthday this summer with a barbecue and a tea party. Manager Bethan Mascarenhas said residents were excited by the changes It is up to individual care homes and councils to decide whether to allow visits. Old Vicarage manager Bethan Mascarenhas said: ""Pets are a huge thing, and a huge comfort to residents, especially if they are shared with spouses. ""And there is a bit more guidance around trips out, which is really exciting for residents."" First Minister Mark Drakeford said the changes would ""improve the quality of life for residents and their families"". They come asCovid case rates continue to falland will allow care homes for adults and children to open their doors to more relatives and friends. This video can not be played Lynn Parker was last able to hold her husband's hand 10 months before he died Many people have been unable to visit family and friends in care homes since indoor visits were halted at the start of the pandemic, with some only able to see residents through windows. Relatives had criticised the restrictions as cruel,with children and partners describing how they were unable to hold their loved one's hand or reassure them in the months before they died. While outdoor visits have been permitted since last summer, local lockdown rules and outbreaks meant many care homes temporarily stopped people visiting. Indoor visitsby one designated person have only been allowed since 13 March. This video can not be played ""We can't see mum unless she has hours to live"" On 26 April,as beer gardens and outdoor cafes reopened, visiting guidance was eased, allowing two people to visit a care home resident indoors at the same time. However, under the rules these had to be designated visitors, meaning the same two people had to visit every time. Under the new guidance, any two people will now be able to visit inside at a time, after having a negative Covid test. It comes as more than one million people received both doses of their Covid vaccine in Wales,with the weekly infection rate now standing at 9.7 cases for every 100,000 people. 'We had 15 minutes to say goodbye to mum' Care homes see lowest case rates since September While visitors can hold their relative's hand, they have to wear face masks, unless they are socially distanced from residents and in a well-ventilated room. Babies and very young infants do not count towards the visitor limit, but the Welsh government is advising them not to visit indoors due to social distancing concerns. There are no limits to the numbers of people able to visit outside. Friends and family are also now allowed to take animals in to care homes for visits. Prydwen Elfed-Owens said she feared her husband would ""give up"" if the home's restrictions were not changed Prydwen Elfed-Owens has only been able to be in the same room as her husband twice during the pandemic, and has been talking to him through a window. Her husband Tom, who has dementia, has not been outside his care home in St Asaph, Denbighshire, for the past 18 months. Although they have both had two doses of the Covid vaccine, Mrs Elfed-Owens has only been allowed by the care home to visit him face-to-face twice. Prydwen Elfed-Owens has only been able to see her husband indoors twice since the start of the pandemic She said the vaccines and tests before visits were pointless, adding: ""We still can't go anywhere near a person who needs affection, now more than any time, at all."" Mrs Elfed-Owens said she feared her husband would also ""give up"" if restrictions at the home did not change. The care home declined to comment and the Welsh government said, while it encouraged all care home providers to allow indoor visits, visiting rules were down to the individual care home. When can you eat indoors and when do cinemas open? How many people have been vaccinated in Wales? ""Care homes should do this in a way that minimises risk to residents and visitors based on a dynamic risk assessment of the circumstances of the individual care home, and the people living there,"" a spokesperson said. Care Forum Wales, which represents health and social care providers, said the guidelines were clear, and that while homes wanted to allow visits by relatives, they must also assess the risks.

"The World Health Organization's head says all health workers and elderly worldwide would be vaccinated by now if jabs were shared fairly Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus says governments vaccinating low risk groups do so at the expense of vulnerable people elsewhere He says the world should do a ""massive push to vaccinate at least 10% of the population of every country by September"" British tourists can now enter Spain without any restrictions, but UK rules mean they must still take tests and quarantine when they're back ""We are not trying to rush into this... we have learnt from the pandemic,"" says Spain's tourism minister Fernando ValdÃ©s Statistics show overseas visitors to the UK fell by about three-quarters in 2020 - as did overseas travel by UK residents The number of coronavirus deaths in India passes 300,000, although experts say the number could be much higher Lockdown rules are easing in Northern Ireland - with indoor socialising in groups of up to six allowed and pubs reopening inside More than 250 pupils are isolating after 26 positive cases were confirmed at a school in Porthcawl, south Wales Edited by James Clarke And that's it from us today.

A medical worker injects a man with a dose of the Covid-19 vaccine at a hospital in Accra, capital of Ghana as part of the Covax scheme We're about to bring our coverage to a close but here is a little reminder of some of today's headlines from around the world:   A secondary school in Middlesbrough is closing for the rest of the week following a number of positive Covid cases. Students at The King's Academy in Coulby Newham will continue their learning online after Middlesbrough Council closed the school after Covid infections were found in all year groups. A mobile testing unit will soon be set up in the grounds with all students and staff encouraged to have a PCR test. Principal David Dawes says: ""We've acted quickly in response to a small number of cases. We will always put the safety of the wider community first."" Clackmannanshire has overtaken Glasgow City as having the highest Covid rate in Scotland. New figures show the region had a seven-day average rate of 139.7 cases per 100,000 people compared to Glasgow City's 136.8. The equivalent case rate for the whole of the UK is 23 per 100,000 people Glasgow is the only part of Scotland under level three Covid restrictions. Health Secretary Humza Yousaf says: ""Clackmannanshire has a really small population, so even four, five, six households testing positive can really make the numbers look like they're shooting up. But it is a concerning situation."" Residents have been encouraged to take a Covid test and extra test facilities have been set up. You can read morehere. Here are the latest graphs showing the progress of the pandemic in the UK. As you can see deaths from Covid-19 remain at low levels while the number of cases is leveling off. There is no ""plan B"" for fans inside Hampden at Euro 2020 if Glasgow remains in Scottish government level three restrictions, says the Scottish Football Association. Doubts exist over whether supporters will still be allowed in for the four matches at Scotland's national stadium. A minimum crowd of 12,000 has been agreed with Uefa for those games, butno fans were allowed to attend Saturday's Scottish Cup final. ""The games will be at Hampden,"" says SFA chief executive Ian Maxwell. ""There can't be any plan B in terms of spectators because of ticket sales and stadium processes and all of those things, but hopefully we don't need to get to that point."" Maxwell says the SFA is in daily contact with the Scottish government about the Covid-19 situation in Glasgow. The local authority area is currentlythe only one in Scotland in level three,meaning large crowds are prohibited in the city. Northern Ireland is the latest UK nation to update its rules on weddings. From today, there is no government limit on the number of people allowed at wedding ceremonies in NI. But that doesn't mean you can have unlimited numbers - instead, the limit depends on how many people each venue can safely accommodate. Face masks must also be worn by guests in the ceremony, and while receptions can go ahead, there are some rules. Tables must be no bigger than 10 guests (except for the top table), the wedding couple can only have one dance and live music is not allowed. The rules in England and Wales currently limit the total number of people to 30, while in Scotland the limit is 50 providing people can socially distance. For more information on the latest rules, head here. Chris JeavansBBC News Bolton, Blackburn and
Bedford accounted for almost 900 cases of the variant first identified in
India, in the latest week of available data. Genomic analysis by theSanger Institute,externalfor the week of 9-15 May, found a total of 1,900 cases of
the B.1.617.2 variant across England. Of these, 611 were in
Bolton, 145 in Blackburn with Darwen and 126 in Bedford. All regions of England saw
some cases of the variant, with numbers and rates generally highest in the
North West - as seen on this map. Sequencing positive
coronavirus test results to find out which variant they contain takes several
days so there is always a lag in the data. However, this picture is
broadly similar to the findings Public Health England put out at the
weekend. PHE also found almost
half of all the coronavirus cases it had sequenced in the most recent week were
B.1.617.2 and that prevalence of the variant had risen rapidly. Marilyn Muldoon is looking forward to being reunited with cat Queenie who has a pet passport A British couple who rent a house in Spain say they will attempt to drive over to collect their belongings and their cat now that Spain has opened its borders to UK travellers. Marilyn Muldoon from Westwoodside, North
Lincolnshire, says she and her husband had rented a house in Pruna, between Malaga and Seville, for a year last July. They returned home for Christmas but were not able to get back after the UK went into another lockdown and international travel was banned. With their tenancy up in July, they want to go back and collect their things and cat Queenie who is being looked after by a neighbour, but say they are confused by travel advice. Marilyn says: ""We've no idea what news to believe or even how to go about
trying to find the right information. Itâs been the waiting. Even when people
tell you on the news, itâs still confusing. Spain is on the amber list, so you
can go but youâre not meant to."" She says they will set off in the next week by ferry to Santander and have ""no objections"" to quarantining when they get back. A further three deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test have been reported across the UK. There were also a further 2,439 positive cases identified,according to the latest figures,external. An additional 126,357 people received their first dose of a vaccination, while 252,139 received a second jab.

Members of an amateur choir in North Yorkshire are among a chorus of voices across the country calling for a change in Covid restrictions to allow them to perform. Current Covid guidelines state choirs can only perform or rehearse indoors in groups of no more than six. Craig Ratcliffe, musical director of Tadcaster Community Choir, says: ""There's not been consideration for the differences that choirs can have"". Meanwhile, the chair of the choir, Celia Oldroyd, says not being able to perform is ""depressing"". The Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport says it understands it is ""disappointing"" but ""we are taking decisions based on the advice of our public health experts"". There are reports in India that a couple chartered a plane to hold a mid-air wedding with more than 160 guests in an effort to escape Covid restrictions. Video footage posted on social media appearsto show the couple and their guests packed into a hired jet. The state of Tamil Nadu, where the flight is said to have originated, recently imposed tougher restrictions, limiting weddings to 50 guests.

More than 250 pupils are isolating after 26 people tested positive for coronavirus at a Welsh school. In total 267 out of about 400 pupils have been sent home from West Park Primary, in Porthcawl, south Wales. Bridgend Council says parents have ""been advised to remain alert"" and online learning is being arranged. A spokesman says four staff and 22 pupils had tested positive. They say ""all staff and most pupils"" in year one were affected. There were also cases among pupils ""in nursery, reception, year two and year threeâ³, theLocal Democracy Reporting Servicesays.

More than 1.5 billion doses of coronavirus vaccines have been administered, in at least 189 countries worldwide. However, there are vast differences in the pace of progress in different parts of the world. The UK, for example, is on the brink of vaccinating its under-30s, while some countries are still waiting for their first shipments. Earlier, the head of the World Health Organization said the unequal distribution of vaccines was ""scandalous"". Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the gap was making the global pandemic worse - and that 75% of all doses have gone to just 10 countries. Many poorer countries are relying on deliveries from Covax. Dr Tedros has told rich countries to start donating some of their doses now - rather than waiting for surplus - and asked pharmaceutical companies to give the WHO first refusal on all new batches of vaccine. The aim is to vaccinate 10% of every countryâs population by September, he says. Read more about vaccination worldwide here.

Dr Frank Atherton says a spike in the Indian variant to ""around 57"" cases from 28 last Thursday is ""something we need to watch very carefully"". He says most of these cases were in Cardiff and the Vale of Glamorgan, although they have been identified in all health board areas apart from Powys. He says measures such as social distancing and using face coverings were ""the things that keep us safe"" and there was a risk the situation could ""go into reverse"" if those measures were relaxed. ""The public should be worried about the resurgence in coronavirus in general really,"" he says. ""We have a small number of cases - 57 at the moment of the so-called Indian variant - but that will be an underestimate and I expect the numbers to rise."" Read more. About half the people who were due to get a Covid jab at a mass vaccination centre in Glasgow failed to turn up over the weekend. The BBC has learned a ""considerable"" number of no shows were recorded on both Saturday and Sunday at the Hydro. The venue can administer a minimum of 4,000 vaccinations each day, with a capacity to scale up to 10,000. Glasgow has the highest coronavirus rates in the country at 133 cases per 100,000 people in the seven days to 20 May. It is the only council area in Scotland under level three Covid restrictions and people aged 18 to 39 in certain postcode areas are being offered jabs early to tackle surging cases.

"The raid happened days after Arundel Castle reopened on Tuesday A set of gold rosary beads carried by Mary Queen of Scots at her execution in 1587 was among items worth more than Â£1m stolen in a raid on Arundel Castle. The gold and silver artefacts were snatched from the West Sussex castle on Friday night. Other pieces taken during the raid include coronation cups given by Mary to the Earl Marshal. An Arundel Castle spokesman said the stolen items were of ""priceless historical importance"". The castle only reopened to the public on Tuesday. Staff were alerted to the break-in at 22:30 BST on Friday after a burglar alarm went off. Sussex Police told the BBC the thieves entered through a window and smashed a glass cabinet to grab the items. Det Con Molly O'Malley said the force thinks a 4x4 saloon found abandoned and on fire in nearby Barlavington ""was linked"" to the raid. The castle spokesman said the rosary had ""little intrinsic value as metal"" but was ""irreplaceable"".

A medical worker injects a man with a dose of the Covid-19 vaccine at a hospital in Accra, capital of Ghana as part of the Covax scheme We're about to bring our coverage to a close but here is a little reminder of some of today's headlines from around the world:   A secondary school in Middlesbrough is closing for the rest of the week following a number of positive Covid cases. Students at The King's Academy in Coulby Newham will continue their learning online after Middlesbrough Council closed the school after Covid infections were found in all year groups. A mobile testing unit will soon be set up in the grounds with all students and staff encouraged to have a PCR test. Principal David Dawes says: ""We've acted quickly in response to a small number of cases. We will always put the safety of the wider community first."" Clackmannanshire has overtaken Glasgow City as having the highest Covid rate in Scotland. New figures show the region had a seven-day average rate of 139.7 cases per 100,000 people compared to Glasgow City's 136.8. The equivalent case rate for the whole of the UK is 23 per 100,000 people Glasgow is the only part of Scotland under level three Covid restrictions. Health Secretary Humza Yousaf says: ""Clackmannanshire has a really small population, so even four, five, six households testing positive can really make the numbers look like they're shooting up. But it is a concerning situation."" Residents have been encouraged to take a Covid test and extra test facilities have been set up. You can read morehere. Here are the latest graphs showing the progress of the pandemic in the UK. As you can see deaths from Covid-19 remain at low levels while the number of cases is leveling off. There is no ""plan B"" for fans inside Hampden at Euro 2020 if Glasgow remains in Scottish government level three restrictions, says the Scottish Football Association. Doubts exist over whether supporters will still be allowed in for the four matches at Scotland's national stadium. A minimum crowd of 12,000 has been agreed with Uefa for those games, butno fans were allowed to attend Saturday's Scottish Cup final. ""The games will be at Hampden,"" says SFA chief executive Ian Maxwell. ""There can't be any plan B in terms of spectators because of ticket sales and stadium processes and all of those things, but hopefully we don't need to get to that point."" Maxwell says the SFA is in daily contact with the Scottish government about the Covid-19 situation in Glasgow. The local authority area is currentlythe only one in Scotland in level three,meaning large crowds are prohibited in the city. Northern Ireland is the latest UK nation to update its rules on weddings. From today, there is no government limit on the number of people allowed at wedding ceremonies in NI. But that doesn't mean you can have unlimited numbers - instead, the limit depends on how many people each venue can safely accommodate. Face masks must also be worn by guests in the ceremony, and while receptions can go ahead, there are some rules. Tables must be no bigger than 10 guests (except for the top table), the wedding couple can only have one dance and live music is not allowed. The rules in England and Wales currently limit the total number of people to 30, while in Scotland the limit is 50 providing people can socially distance. For more information on the latest rules, head here. Chris JeavansBBC News Bolton, Blackburn and
Bedford accounted for almost 900 cases of the variant first identified in
India, in the latest week of available data. Genomic analysis by theSanger Institute,externalfor the week of 9-15 May, found a total of 1,900 cases of
the B.1.617.2 variant across England. Of these, 611 were in
Bolton, 145 in Blackburn with Darwen and 126 in Bedford. All regions of England saw
some cases of the variant, with numbers and rates generally highest in the
North West - as seen on this map. Sequencing positive
coronavirus test results to find out which variant they contain takes several
days so there is always a lag in the data. However, this picture is
broadly similar to the findings Public Health England put out at the
weekend. PHE also found almost
half of all the coronavirus cases it had sequenced in the most recent week were
B.1.617.2 and that prevalence of the variant had risen rapidly. Marilyn Muldoon is looking forward to being reunited with cat Queenie who has a pet passport A British couple who rent a house in Spain say they will attempt to drive over to collect their belongings and their cat now that Spain has opened its borders to UK travellers. Marilyn Muldoon from Westwoodside, North
Lincolnshire, says she and her husband had rented a house in Pruna, between Malaga and Seville, for a year last July. They returned home for Christmas but were not able to get back after the UK went into another lockdown and international travel was banned. With their tenancy up in July, they want to go back and collect their things and cat Queenie who is being looked after by a neighbour, but say they are confused by travel advice. Marilyn says: ""We've no idea what news to believe or even how to go about
trying to find the right information. Itâs been the waiting. Even when people
tell you on the news, itâs still confusing. Spain is on the amber list, so you
can go but youâre not meant to."" She says they will set off in the next week by ferry to Santander and have ""no objections"" to quarantining when they get back. A further three deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test have been reported across the UK. There were also a further 2,439 positive cases identified,according to the latest figures,external. An additional 126,357 people received their first dose of a vaccination, while 252,139 received a second jab. This video can not be played Members of the amateur choir say the rules need changing so they can perform indoors. Members of an amateur choir in North Yorkshire are among a chorus of voices across the country calling for a change in Covid restrictions to allow them to perform. Current Covid guidelines state choirs can only perform or rehearse indoors in groups of no more than six. Craig Ratcliffe, musical director of Tadcaster Community Choir, says: ""There's not been consideration for the differences that choirs can have"". Meanwhile, the chair of the choir, Celia Oldroyd, says not being able to perform is ""depressing"". The Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport says it understands it is ""disappointing"" but ""we are taking decisions based on the advice of our public health experts"". There are reports in India that a couple chartered a plane to hold a mid-air wedding with more than 160 guests in an effort to escape Covid restrictions. Video footage posted on social media appearsto show the couple and their guests packed into a hired jet. The state of Tamil Nadu, where the flight is said to have originated, recently imposed tougher restrictions, limiting weddings to 50 guests. India's aviation authority has launched an investigation, reports say. An official from the Directorate General of Civil Aviation tells the Times of India the SpiceJet staff aboard the flight had been taken off duty. A SpiceJet spokesperson tells the Indian Express the Boeing 737 was booked from Madurai to Bangalore by a travel agent for a trip after a wedding. The spokesperson says the client was ""clearly briefed on Covid guidelines to be followed and denied permission for any activity to be performed on board"".

To mark the opening Sadiq Khan is announcing the launch of a bereavement support programme that will direct people to advice and support and that will begin with a public awareness campaign. He says the garden will be a lasting living memorial to the more than 19,000 Londoners who have died during the pandemic.

More than 250 pupils are isolating after 26 people tested positive for coronavirus at a Welsh school. In total 267 out of about 400 pupils have been sent home from West Park Primary, in Porthcawl, south Wales. Bridgend Council says parents have ""been advised to remain alert"" and online learning is being arranged. A spokesman says four staff and 22 pupils had tested positive. They say ""all staff and most pupils"" in year one were affected. There were also cases among pupils ""in nursery, reception, year two and year threeâ³, theLocal Democracy Reporting Servicesays. The council says 68 brothers and sisters of the pupils sent home have also been told to isolate, meaning a total of 335 people are home learning. More than 1.5 billion doses of coronavirus vaccines have been administered, in at least 189 countries worldwide. However, there are vast differences in the pace of progress in different parts of the world. The UK, for example, is on the brink of vaccinating its under-30s, while some countries are still waiting for their first shipments. Earlier, the head of the World Health Organization said the unequal distribution of vaccines was ""scandalous"". Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the gap was making the global pandemic worse - and that 75% of all doses have gone to just 10 countries. Many poorer countries are relying on deliveries from Covax. Dr Tedros has told rich countries to start donating some of their doses now - rather than waiting for surplus - and asked pharmaceutical companies to give the WHO first refusal on all new batches of vaccine. The aim is to vaccinate 10% of every countryâs population by September, he says. Read more about vaccination worldwide here.

"Paul Farrell targeted his victims between 1985 and 2020, committing offences at addresses across London A Great Ormond Street Hospital porter who befriended the parents of his young victims to allow him to abuse boys across London has been jailed for life. Paul Farrell, 55, kept a diary of threats and bribes used to keep one of the children under control, Wood Green Crown Court heard. Farrell admitted 76 offences against eight victims, from 1985 to 2020. He must spend at least 18 years in jail. He used an area of the hospital for abuse but did not target patients. Prosecutors linked Farrell, of Camden, north London, to at least 500 instances of abuse, although they estimate the true figure is ""likely to be in the thousands"". His 35-year campaign of abuse included attempted rape, sexual assault of a child under 13 and making indecent photographs of children. Farrell worked at Great Ormond Street Hospital between 1994 and 2020 Farrell, who pleaded guilty at a previous hearing, acted as a babysitter to people he had befriended in order to gain access to their children. He kept a diary of threats and bribes made to one of his victims, who was aged 12 when the abuse began. To stop the boy from telling anyone about the attacks, Farrell hid a camera in the boy's room. Prosecutors said Farrell had ""groomed"" the entire family to enable him to abuse the boy and his two younger brothers, setting reminders to buy members of the family presents or to offer himself as a babysitter. Another victim, who was five years old when the abuse began, told Farrell in court: ""Innocent children like me and my brother will be profoundly scarred by your actions for the rest of our lives. ""I now feel hopeless, lost and disgusted at my silence that has allowed you to ruin the lives of so many innocent children."" Paul Farrell was sentenced to a minimum term of 18 years in prison at Wood Green Crown Court Judge Noel Lucas said Farrell had a ""deep-seated fixation with sexual activity with very young boys"". The judge said: ""It is difficult to fully comprehend the fear, confusion and vulnerabilities your young victims must have suffered as you repeatedly used and abused them to satisfy your sexual desires. ""For the whole of your adult life you have pursued your predatory interest in committing intimate sexual acts with very young boys with an all-consuming determination, irrespective of their attempts to make you desist."" A Great Ormond Street Hospital spokesman said: ""Our thoughts remain with the brave victims and their families whose stories have been shared in court. ""While we have heard in court that Paul Farrell did not target children at GOSH, his association with our hospital is distressing for the hospital community. ""We are deeply sorry that he was able to exploit his position and use our hospital to commit some of his crimes. ""Our safeguarding practices will remain rigorous and under regular review and we are actively considering whether anything more can be done to prevent crimes like this.""

"The raid happened days after Arundel Castle reopened on Tuesday A set of gold rosary beads carried by Mary Queen of Scots at her execution in 1587 was among items worth more than Â£1m stolen in a raid on Arundel Castle. The gold and silver artefacts were snatched from the West Sussex castle on Friday night. Other pieces taken during the raid include coronation cups given by Mary to the Earl Marshal. An Arundel Castle spokesman said the stolen items were of ""priceless historical importance"". The castle only reopened to the public on Tuesday. Staff were alerted to the break-in at 22:30 BST on Friday after a burglar alarm went off. Sussex Police told the BBC the thieves entered through a window and smashed a glass cabinet to grab the items. Det Con Molly O'Malley said the force thinks a 4x4 saloon found abandoned and on fire in nearby Barlavington ""was linked"" to the raid. The castle spokesman said the rosary had ""little intrinsic value as metal"" but was ""irreplaceable"". The rosary beads were carried by Mary as she was led to her death A spokesman for Arundel Castle Trustees said: ""The stolen items have significant monetary value, but as unique artefacts of the Duke of Norfolk's collection have immeasurably greater and priceless historical importance. ""We therefore urge anyone with information to come forward to the police to assist them in returning these treasures back where they belong."" Peter Squires, professor of criminology at the University of Brighton, said there was a ""surprising amount"" of thefts of ""antiquities or cultural artefacts"". He said items were often stolen to order and end up in the private collections of very rich people. He told BBC Radio Sussex: ""In war zones in the Middle East, there is a lot of evidence of museums being looted and the stolen items quickly finding themselves on to the dark web where they are bid on by dealers. ""Gold of course may just be melted down, which massively reduces its value, so to find someone who wants the items rather than just the bullion value is the thieves' objective here."" The items were taken from a display cabinet, police say Professor Kate Williams of Reading University said: ""When [Mary] fled Scotland into England most of her belongings were despoiled and shared out. ""Then after she was executed, nearly everything she had was taken and burned because people were concerned she would turn into a Catholic martyr. ""So we had one tiny memorial of Mary Queen of Scots - and now it has gone."" Det Con O'Malley urged people who were in Arundel on Friday evening and saw any suspicious activity around the area of the castle to contact the force either online or by calling 101, quoting Operation Deuce. ""The castle only re-opened to visitors on Tuesday 18 May, so if you were visiting during the past few days do you on reflection recall anyone behaving at all suspiciously?"" he said. Mary Queen of Scots was held in captivity for 18 years before she was executed Mary was born at Linlithgow Palace in 1542 and became queen when her father died soon after her birth However, Mary was taken to France in 1548 and Scotland was ruled by regents She returned in 1561 to begin her reign as Queen of Scots but was forced to abdicate at the age of 24 after six tumultuous years After an unsuccessful attempt to regain the throne, Mary fled to England seeking the protection of her cousin, Elizabeth I Mary had once claimed Elizabeth's throne as her own and was considered the legitimate sovereign by many English Catholics The Scots queen was held in captivity for 18 years before she was executed at Fotheringhay Castle in 1587, at the age of 44 Her son James became king of Scotland and England Mary, Queen of Scots film 'problematic' Mary Queen of Scots documents found Fierce winds threaten more fire destruction as LA struggles to contain blazes Powerful images of loss and heroism from LA UK has enough gas says No 10 after storage warning What's the latest on the Los Angeles wildfires and what caused them?

"More ways of supporting people to self-isolate in areas with higher coronavirus infection rates are to be piloted in nine parts of England. There will be ""buddying"" services for people needing mental health support and alternative accommodation for those in overcrowded homes. Social care support and translation services will also be available. It is hoped the schemes will encourage more people to get tested and self-isolate if required. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said this was ""vital"" in the fight against new Covid variants. ""Variants have the potential to be a Trojan horse for our hard won progress and it is more vital than ever that we do what we can to show them the exit door, following the rules and self-isolating when asked,"" he said. Will I get paid if I self-isolate? Few with Covid symptoms self-isolating, study finds How do I get my free Covid tests? How many people are being paid to self-isolate? The areas that will receive funding from a Â£12m pot for the pilots are: Newham and Hackney in London Yorkshire and Humber Lancashire, Blackburn & Darwen, Blackpool Greater Manchester Cheshire and Merseyside Royal Borough of Kingston Peterborough, Fenland and South Holland Somerset There will be language communications support for those who do not speak English as their first language, and social care support, such as increasing existing social care support for vulnerable adults. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: ""We recognise just how challenging self-isolation is for many people and these pilots will help us find the best ways to support people and making it easier for everyone to keep doing their bit."" However, people in pilot areas will not receive further financial support when self-isolating. Under current rules,a Â£500 grant has been made available,externalin England to people on low incomes who have to self-isolate. Labour has been calling on the government to expand eligibility for this scheme. LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? LOCKDOWN RULES:What are they and when will they end? GLOBAL SPREAD:How many worldwide cases are there? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters The government is already backing a pilot across the Greater Manchester region with Â£2m of funding to assess ways of helping people self-isolate. This includes ""support and engagement teams"" who work with households within 24 hours of a positive Covid test to develop a bespoke plan for self-isolation. James Jamieson, chairman of the Local Government Association, said rapidly targeting local outbreaks was crucial to tackling the spread of the virus. ""These pilot schemes will provide further insight into what works best in supporting those who test positive and their contacts to do the right thing to protect themselves, their families and their wider communities,"" he said. People who have tested positive for coronavirus and those considered at risk of having been exposed to it must self-isolate. This means staying at home and not leaving it - even to buy food, medicines or other essentials, or for exercise.

In other developments: Spain haslifted its restrictions on travellers from the United Kingdom, taking effect from Monday. However, the country is on the government's amber list, with ministers saying people should not visit for holidays Northern Ireland is lifting the ban on indoor socialising, following rules which have already changed in England, Scotland and Wales. Among other changes, hospitality venues can serve customers indoors and up to six people from two households can meet in homes again On Sunday, the government announced that60.6 million first and second vaccine doses had been administered since 8 December. The figure includes 37.9 million people who have received a first dose - 72% of the UK adult population - and 22.6 million have had both (43%). The number of second doses administered in the UK hit a daily record on Saturday at 556,951. Dr Jenny Harries, chief executive of the UK Health Security Agency, said the possibility of restrictions being eased on 21 June - as planned under the government's road map out of lockdown - was ""looking good"". But she urged the public to be cautious to avoid another lockdown, warning that the new Indian variant has become the ""dominant strain"" in some parts of the country. Under the plans, from 21 June nightclubs would be allowed to reopen and restrictions on large events, such as festivals, would be lifted. Prof Adam Finn, a member of the government's Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, said there might be an ""adjustment"" to the lifting of restrictions on this date. He told Times Radio on Sunday: ""We're effectively in a race with the vaccine programme against the virus. ""We know that we're letting the virus out by spreading it about now, we know that we're progressing well with the vaccine programme, but I think there's going to need to be an adjustment of some sort.""

"The World Health Organization's head says all health workers and elderly worldwide would be vaccinated by now if jabs were shared fairly Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus says governments vaccinating low risk groups do so at the expense of vulnerable people elsewhere He says the world should do a ""massive push to vaccinate at least 10% of the population of every country by September"" British tourists can now enter Spain without any restrictions, but UK rules mean they must still take tests and quarantine when they're back ""We are not trying to rush into this... we have learnt from the pandemic,"" says Spain's tourism minister Fernando ValdÃ©s Statistics show overseas visitors to the UK fell by about three-quarters in 2020 - as did overseas travel by UK residents The number of coronavirus deaths in India passes 300,000, although experts say the number could be much higher Lockdown rules are easing in Northern Ireland - with indoor socialising in groups of up to six allowed and pubs reopening inside More than 250 pupils are isolating after 26 positive cases were confirmed at a school in Porthcawl, south Wales Edited by James Clarke And that's it from us today. This coverage has been brought to you by Francesca Gillett, Doug Faulkner, Jennifer Meierhans, Rob Corp and James Clarke. Thanks for joining us and we will be back again tomorrow to bring you the latest coronavirus news from across the world. A medical worker injects a man with a dose of the Covid-19 vaccine at a hospital in Accra, capital of Ghana as part of the Covax scheme We're about to bring our coverage to a close but here is a little reminder of some of today's headlines from around the world:   A secondary school in Middlesbrough is closing for the rest of the week following a number of positive Covid cases. Students at The King's Academy in Coulby Newham will continue their learning online after Middlesbrough Council closed the school after Covid infections were found in all year groups. A mobile testing unit will soon be set up in the grounds with all students and staff encouraged to have a PCR test. Principal David Dawes says: ""We've acted quickly in response to a small number of cases. We will always put the safety of the wider community first."" Clackmannanshire has overtaken Glasgow City as having the highest Covid rate in Scotland. New figures show the region had a seven-day average rate of 139.7 cases per 100,000 people compared to Glasgow City's 136.8. The equivalent case rate for the whole of the UK is 23 per 100,000 people Glasgow is the only part of Scotland under level three Covid restrictions. Health Secretary Humza Yousaf says: ""Clackmannanshire has a really small population, so even four, five, six households testing positive can really make the numbers look like they're shooting up. But it is a concerning situation."" Residents have been encouraged to take a Covid test and extra test facilities have been set up. You can read morehere. Here are the latest graphs showing the progress of the pandemic in the UK. As you can see deaths from Covid-19 remain at low levels while the number of cases is leveling off. There is no ""plan B"" for fans inside Hampden at Euro 2020 if Glasgow remains in Scottish government level three restrictions, says the Scottish Football Association. Doubts exist over whether supporters will still be allowed in for the four matches at Scotland's national stadium. A minimum crowd of 12,000 has been agreed with Uefa for those games, butno fans were allowed to attend Saturday's Scottish Cup final. ""The games will be at Hampden,"" says SFA chief executive Ian Maxwell. ""There can't be any plan B in terms of spectators because of ticket sales and stadium processes and all of those things, but hopefully we don't need to get to that point."" Maxwell says the SFA is in daily contact with the Scottish government about the Covid-19 situation in Glasgow. The local authority area is currentlythe only one in Scotland in level three,meaning large crowds are prohibited in the city. Northern Ireland is the latest UK nation to update its rules on weddings. From today, there is no government limit on the number of people allowed at wedding ceremonies in NI. But that doesn't mean you can have unlimited numbers - instead, the limit depends on how many people each venue can safely accommodate. Face masks must also be worn by guests in the ceremony, and while receptions can go ahead, there are some rules. Tables must be no bigger than 10 guests (except for the top table), the wedding couple can only have one dance and live music is not allowed. The rules in England and Wales currently limit the total number of people to 30, while in Scotland the limit is 50 providing people can socially distance. For more information on the latest rules, head here. Chris JeavansBBC News Bolton, Blackburn and
Bedford accounted for almost 900 cases of the variant first identified in
India, in the latest week of available data. Genomic analysis by theSanger Institute,externalfor the week of 9-15 May, found a total of 1,900 cases of
the B.1.617.2 variant across England. Of these, 611 were in
Bolton, 145 in Blackburn with Darwen and 126 in Bedford. All regions of England saw
some cases of the variant, with numbers and rates generally highest in the
North West - as seen on this map. Sequencing positive
coronavirus test results to find out which variant they contain takes several
days so there is always a lag in the data. However, this picture is
broadly similar to the findings Public Health England put out at the
weekend. PHE also found almost
half of all the coronavirus cases it had sequenced in the most recent week were
B.1.617.2 and that prevalence of the variant had risen rapidly. Marilyn Muldoon is looking forward to being reunited with cat Queenie who has a pet passport A British couple who rent a house in Spain say they will attempt to drive over to collect their belongings and their cat now that Spain has opened its borders to UK travellers. Marilyn Muldoon from Westwoodside, North
Lincolnshire, says she and her husband had rented a house in Pruna, between Malaga and Seville, for a year last July. They returned home for Christmas but were not able to get back after the UK went into another lockdown and international travel was banned. With their tenancy up in July, they want to go back and collect their things and cat Queenie who is being looked after by a neighbour, but say they are confused by travel advice. Marilyn says: ""We've no idea what news to believe or even how to go about
trying to find the right information. Itâs been the waiting. Even when people
tell you on the news, itâs still confusing. Spain is on the amber list, so you
can go but youâre not meant to."" She says they will set off in the next week by ferry to Santander and have ""no objections"" to quarantining when they get back. A further three deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test have been reported across the UK. There were also a further 2,439 positive cases identified,according to the latest figures,external. An additional 126,357 people received their first dose of a vaccination, while 252,139 received a second jab. This video can not be played Members of the amateur choir say the rules need changing so they can perform indoors. Members of an amateur choir in North Yorkshire are among a chorus of voices across the country calling for a change in Covid restrictions to allow them to perform. Current Covid guidelines state choirs can only perform or rehearse indoors in groups of no more than six. Craig Ratcliffe, musical director of Tadcaster Community Choir, says: ""There's not been consideration for the differences that choirs can have"". Meanwhile, the chair of the choir, Celia Oldroyd, says not being able to perform is ""depressing"". The Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport says it understands it is ""disappointing"" but ""we are taking decisions based on the advice of our public health experts"". There are reports in India that a couple chartered a plane to hold a mid-air wedding with more than 160 guests in an effort to escape Covid restrictions. Video footage posted on social media appearsto show the couple and their guests packed into a hired jet. The state of Tamil Nadu, where the flight is said to have originated, recently imposed tougher restrictions, limiting weddings to 50 guests. India's aviation authority has launched an investigation, reports say. An official from the Directorate General of Civil Aviation tells the Times of India the SpiceJet staff aboard the flight had been taken off duty. A SpiceJet spokesperson tells the Indian Express the Boeing 737 was booked from Madurai to Bangalore by a travel agent for a trip after a wedding. The spokesperson says the client was ""clearly briefed on Covid guidelines to be followed and denied permission for any activity to be performed on board"".

The London Blossom Garden at the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park in Stratford, east London, commemorates Londoners who have died during the pandemic. It features 33 blossom trees to represent the 32 London Boroughs and the City of London. To mark the opening Sadiq Khan is announcing the launch of a bereavement support programme that will direct people to advice and support and that will begin with a public awareness campaign. He says the garden will be a lasting living memorial to the more than 19,000 Londoners who have died during the pandemic.

""Nothing will make losing someone you love any easier, but we want Londoners to know they are not alone. We are here for you, as a city."" More than 250 pupils are isolating after 26 people tested positive for coronavirus at a Welsh school. In total 267 out of about 400 pupils have been sent home from West Park Primary, in Porthcawl, south Wales. Bridgend Council says parents have ""been advised to remain alert"" and online learning is being arranged. A spokesman says four staff and 22 pupils had tested positive. They say ""all staff and most pupils"" in year one were affected. There were also cases among pupils ""in nursery, reception, year two and year threeâ³, theLocal Democracy Reporting Servicesays. The council says 68 brothers and sisters of the pupils sent home have also been told to isolate, meaning a total of 335 people are home learning. More than 1.5 billion doses of coronavirus vaccines have been administered, in at least 189 countries worldwide. However, there are vast differences in the pace of progress in different parts of the world. The UK, for example, is on the brink of vaccinating its under-30s, while some countries are still waiting for their first shipments. Earlier, the head of the World Health Organization said the unequal distribution of vaccines was ""scandalous"". Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the gap was making the global pandemic worse - and that 75% of all doses have gone to just 10 countries. Many poorer countries are relying on deliveries from Covax. Dr Tedros has told rich countries to start donating some of their doses now - rather than waiting for surplus - and asked pharmaceutical companies to give the WHO first refusal on all new batches of vaccine. The aim is to vaccinate 10% of every countryâs population by September, he says. Read more about vaccination worldwide here. People ""should be worried"" about a resurgence in Covid, the Welsh government's chief medical officer says. Dr Frank Atherton says a spike in the Indian variant to ""around 57"" cases from 28 last Thursday is ""something we need to watch very carefully"". He says most of these cases were in Cardiff and the Vale of Glamorgan, although they have been identified in all health board areas apart from Powys. He says measures such as social distancing and using face coverings were ""the things that keep us safe"" and there was a risk the situation could ""go into reverse"" if those measures were relaxed. ""The public should be worried about the resurgence in coronavirus in general really,"" he says. ""We have a small number of cases - 57 at the moment of the so-called Indian variant - but that will be an underestimate and I expect the numbers to rise."" Read more. About half the people who were due to get a Covid jab at a mass vaccination centre in Glasgow failed to turn up over the weekend. The BBC has learned a ""considerable"" number of no shows were recorded on both Saturday and Sunday at the Hydro. The venue can administer a minimum of 4,000 vaccinations each day, with a capacity to scale up to 10,000. Glasgow has the highest coronavirus rates in the country at 133 cases per 100,000 people in the seven days to 20 May. It is the only council area in Scotland under level three Covid restrictions and people aged 18 to 39 in certain postcode areas are being offered jabs early to tackle surging cases.

It means 18 to 29-year-olds will receive digital alerts so they don't miss an invitation to book. Registration is not compulsory and people who don't sign up will still get a vaccine appointment offered through the post, as long as their GP details are up to date.

"The helpline, run by the NSPCC, opened on 1 April (stock image) A helpline launched for victims to report abuse and harassment in educational settings has taken hundreds of calls since it opened on 1 April. The service was set up by the Department for Education after testimonies alleging abuse were posted on the website Everyone's Invited. The helpline has had 353 calls and has made 65 referrals to agencies such as the police or children's services. It is is being run by the children's charity the NSPCC. The Everyone's Invited website was set up last year as a place where victims can post anonymous accounts of abuse they had suffered. Thousands of testimonies were shared on the site, and many of the allegations referred to sexual harassment carried out against young women by young men at their school or university. In response to the allegations, the Department for Education decided to work with the NSPCC to ensure processes were in place in the education system to support victims in coming forward. Announcing the new helpline in March, Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said it was vital these allegations were ""dealt with properly"". Schools abuse helpline and review launched Sex abuse claims 'not limited to private schools' School abuse: 'Raped girl ignored by teachers' The NSPCC said sexual abuse, exploitation and harassment by peers were the most common issues reported to the helpline so far. These ranged from incidents such as pupils looking up classmates' skirts, to sharing indecent images and rape. Helpline staff have also responded to contacts from parents who were concerned that safeguarding incidents are not being appropriately handled in schools. One parent of a 14-year-old girl told the helpline: ""Just this week we received a visit from a police officer who told us they were investigating an incident of upskirting by a male pupil at my daughter's school. ""We were told that a teacher had been searching this boy's phone for something unrelated, and discovered several pictures of upskirting of different girls. The only girl that could be identified was my daughter. ""As you can imagine, this came as a huge shock to us. We have no idea who the boy is, or if the images have been shared anywhere."" In June 2020, Soma Sara, who is now 22, shared her experience on Instagram of what she calls ""rape culture"". Within a week she had received and shared more than 300 anonymous responses of people with stories of ""misogyny, harassment, abuse and assault"". The Everyone's Invited,externalwebsite now carries thousands of victims' testimonies, often from schools and universities. Experiences range from being drugged and raped at parties to explicit images being shared over messaging platforms. Kam Thandi, head of the NSPCC helpline, said it was ""absolutely vital"" that people felt comfortable to raise concerns about child abuse and harassment, including children themselves. ""We thank everyone so far who has found the courage to contact the helpline,"" she said. ""Through these calls we have been able to provide much needed support, advice and, where necessary, to refer the information on to police and local authorities for further action. ""We have also heard about the devastating impact this abuse can have later in life if it's not addressed, and have been able to share our experience and expertise to help with the recovery process."" Mr Williamson said: ""I want all victims of abuse to be supported and feel confident to report any allegations."" He added: ""Ofsted is also undertaking a review into safeguarding measures in schools and colleges which will be published shortly."" A spokeswoman for  Everyone's Invited said: ""We encourage survivors who need support to contact the NSPCC, whose helpline is run by very capable and well-trained practitioners."" The Report Abuse in Education helpline can be reached on 0800 136 663, on Monday to Friday 0800-2200, or 0900-1800 at weekends.

"Ariany spent 22 days in detention The US has a vast system of detention sites scattered across the country, holding more than 20,000 migrant children. In a special investigation, the BBC has uncovered allegations of cold temperatures, sickness, neglect, lice and filth, through a series of interviews with children and staff. It was midnight on the Rio Grande - the imposing river that forms the border between Texas and Mexico - and lights began to flash on the Mexican side. Voices could be heard in the darkness. Figures emerged, got into a small raft, and began to cross the river. As the raft appeared on the US side, the faces of the migrants became visible. More than half of them were children. Over March and April,more than 36,000 children,externalcrossed into the US unaccompanied by an adult. This was a record high for recent years. Many children travelling alone set out on their journey hoping to reunite with a parent already in the US. More than 80% of themalready have a family member in the country,external, the US government says. President Joe Biden has opened the border to unaccompanied children seeking asylum, somewhat relaxing former President Trump's policy of turning migrants away due to Covid-19. The children scrambled up the banks, exhausted. Two young cousins held hands. Another youth, Jordy, 17, said he had fled Guatemala because he was afraid of violent gangs operating there. But tonight he was frightened about what might await him in migrant detention centres in the US. He said he had heard stories about them. ""They will put us in an icebox and ask us questions,"" he said. The so-called ""iceboxes"", notorious among migrants, are extremely cold rooms or cubicles in US Border Patrol migrant processing facilities. Jordy said he was escaping gang violence Jordy was told to join a line with other children. US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) guards were taking the children's shoelaces and belts, a process usually reserved for prisoners to prevent them trying to take their own lives. Jordy and the other children were then taken away by bus into the night. They were to join more than 20,000 migrant children now in US detention, held in a series of extensive camps around the country, at least 13 of which are new. In late March, CBP releaseddisturbing imagesof cramped conditions within one particular facility it runs in Donna, Texas - a mass of enormous white tents looming above the small town. The facility was designed to hold 250 people but housed more than 4,000 at peak occupancy. The Donna temporary facility pictured in late March People are seen separated by plastic sheeting in makeshift rooms Journalists have not been allowed to talk to the children inside. Instead we have been tracking down the children who have been released, to find out about conditions in US detention sites. Ten-year-old Ariany, who crossed into the US alone, spent 22 days in detention this spring, most of them in the Donna camp. She was crammed into a plastic cubicle - as were scores of other children, from toddlers to teens - wrapped in a silver emergency blanket. ""We were very cold,"" she said. ""We had nowhere to sleep so we shared mats. We were five girls on two mats."" Ariany was finally reunited with her mother, Sonia, in late March. She had passed her mother's contact details onto US officials who were able to locate her. Sonia had fled Honduras six years ago with her son due to gang violence, leaving Ariany - who was too young at the time to make the journey - behind with her older sister. Cindy, 16, also held in Donna this spring, said there were 80 girls in her cubicle and that she and most of the children were wet under their blankets, due to dripping pipes. ""We all woke up wet."" She said. ""We slept on our sides, all hugged, so we stayed warm."" Cindy was held in a cubicle with 80 other girls A number of children, including Ariany and Paola, a 16-year-old also released from Donna, told the BBC that they were given food that had expired, or was rotten or not cooked properly. They told us that many children became sick. ""Some girls fainted,"" said Jennifer, who was 17 at the time of her detention. Some girls in Donna were able to shower once a week, but others said they did not shower for several weeks at a time. Paola struggled with the filth. ""I started to feel my head itching, and I realised that it was not normal. They checked my head and told me that I had lice."" This video can not be played âI didn't see the light of day.â Hear from children held inside US detention camps. With children eating and sleeping in close quarters, the cubicles quickly became rancid. Ten-year-old Ariany said the guards threatened the children if they did not keep their cramped quarters clean. ""Sometimes they would tell us that if we were doing a lot of mess, they were going to punish us by leaving us there more days,"" she said. At night, the children said, the tents were filled with the sounds of crying. ""We all cried, from the youngest up. There were two-year-old, or one-and-a-half-year-old babies, crying because they wanted their mother,"" said Cindy. Paola said she tried to help the younger ones, but was also worried that she herself would never be reunited with her mother. Paola, 16, said she tried to comfort others ""They cried in front of me, and I just tried to comfort them and tell them that one day we would get out of there - although sometimes inside me I had doubt, because [the staff] would not ask me for my mom's number, her address, and I felt bad too,"" she said. And then one day Cindy began to deteriorate and feel ill. She tested positive for Covid-19, as have a startling number of migrant children in detention. Health and Human Services (HHS) reports more than 3,000 coronavirus cases among migrant children in Texas alone since last year. It is not known what the total number of cases is in the new emergency detention sites around the country. Eventually Cindy, without being told where she was going, was transferred with 40 other Covid positive children onto bus, then plane, and flown 2,400km (1,500 miles) away to San Diego, California. They were taken to a new detention site - a convention centre with the capacity for almost 1,500 children - with row after row of flimsy camp beds. She says she was kept away from the healthy children, in a section full of children with Covid. She said conditions were better than at Donna, but it was still days before she was able to shower. Persecution, gang violence and organised crime, losses from natural disasters (including two Central American hurricanes in 2020), and poverty are all causing parents to send their children to seek refuge in the US. Migrants are vulnerable to exploitation and sexual abuse along the way Most areteenagers from Guatemala, Honduras or El Salvador,external, though some are reported to be as young assix or seven,external They are either sent by relatives on their own,or with people smugglers,externalwho charge thousands of dollars, though reports suggest some families accompany the children to the border and then send them across alone to improve their chances of US entry Most have family members already in the US, about half of whom are a parent Only 4.3% of unaccompanied minors seeking asylumhave been deported since 2014,external Every day, flights leave US border towns loaded with children. ""On some days we estimate that hundreds of children are being transported around the country on these flights,"" said Thomas Cartwright, of Witness at the Border, an organisation that logs the flights. A plane being loaded with migrant children In the past few weeks, the authorities have moved about 3,000 children out of the Border Patrol facility in Donna, transporting many to a new network of child detention centres around the country run by HHS, including the one Cindy was transferred to in San Diego. There are at least 13 such facilities, known as Emergency Intake Sites, on military bases, convention centres, or arenas in major US cities. These are a new part of a network of 200 detention centres for migrant children spread across 22 states. This means that Donna is far less crowded now, with the camp holding around 300 children. The facility is being expanded, as the influx of migrants across the border continues. One of the new Emergency Intake Sites is the Kay Bailey Hutchinson conference centre in central Dallas, which has 2,270 camp beds set up in a grid system in a huge hall, and held hundreds of teenage boys, aged 13-to-17, at its peak. Staff who work in the Dallas site say they have had to sign non-disclosure agreements specifying they are not to talk about what goes on inside. But some agreed to talk to us on condition of anonymity. ""The children always complain about not having enough, not eating enough,"" one staff member said. He also said the convention hall was cold, the boys had one thin blanket each, and were made to stay by their camp beds almost all day. ""Boys have been in there for 45 days straight with no sunlight, no recreation outside, no fresh air, no nothing,"" said the staff member. The moment Ariany reunited with her mother and brother He said that the boys were only given 30 minutes of recreation twice a week in an indoor room and many had been in the convention centre for weeks. ""They are all depressed. I heard the other day that several were contemplating suicide because of the conditions here. ""They are being treated like prisoners, like inmates,"" he said. ""It's haunting that this centre has not been able to meet the minimal standards of caring for unaccompanied minors."" In response to the allegations of neglect of migrant children in the new detention sites, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) said: ""The children are provided a safe and healthy environment with access to nutritious food, clean clothes, comfortable beds, education, recreational activities, and medical services."" ""The Dallas EIS (Emergency Intake Site) is providing required standards of care,"" the statement said. ""The entire administration is working together to reduce the length of time children are in federal custody by making unifications our top priority,"" it added, pointing out that the number of children in the care of the HHS has more than doubled. Children are being released regularly, but for many it is a very slow process. The average time in detention in the emergency centres is a month. The largest Emergency Intake Site is a tented facility at the Fort Bliss military base in El Paso, Texas, holding more than 4,500 children in the searing desert. It has a capacity for more than 10,000. A source inside has told the BBC that some of the tents contain 500-800 girls and boys who sleep in long rows of bunks. The source said hundreds of children are in Covid isolation, and that there are designated tents at the site now for scabies and lice, of which there are also outbreaks. Sources say the living conditions are unsanitary, and that there has been at least one report of sexual abuse in the girls' tent. An official document indicates children under six may be sent to Fort Bliss. The HHS did not respond to a BBC request for comment on these allegations. Amy Cohen, a psychiatrist based on the other side of the country in Los Angeles, has more than 30 years of experience working with traumatised children. She said the alleged conditions in the camps could be extremely damaging for those inside. ""Even after weeks in these conditions, many children are at greater risk of developing major psychiatric illnesses later in life, at greater risk of substance abuse and a greater risk of suicide,"" she said. Cohen said these migrant children would be even more vulnerable because many had been separated from a non-parental family member, or someone they came to rely on as a family member, at the border. ""If a child comes over with someone who is not their biological parent, even if they are their psychological parent, they are uniformly taken away from that individual, taken out of their laps, taken out of their arms, and called an unaccompanied minor."" She also said parents were being forced to make the decision to separate themselves from their children, because families who are turned away often then send their children back across the border alone, rather than risk their welfare in dangerous cities along the Mexican border. There, she says, they are vulnerable to rape, trafficking and assault. ""So these parents, when they find they're unable to protect their children, end up feeling forced to send their children by themselves across the river, in order to preserve their lives."" Cohen said that although children were no longer being physically taken from their biological parents by border guards - as had happened for a time under former President Trump's so-called ""zero tolerance policy"" - the process of family separation was deeply psychologically damaging. ""I interviewed children who were removed from parents under the Trump administration's 'zero tolerance' policyâ¦ and I've interviewed many children who've been now taken away from aunts, and uncles, and siblingsâ¦ I am seeing exactly the same trauma in these children now as we saw in those children then."" The CPB told the BBC that under federal law any child arriving without a parent or legal guardian was considered unaccompanied and must be transferred to the HHS without the adult relative.

"More ways of supporting people to self-isolate in areas with higher coronavirus infection rates are to be piloted in nine parts of England. There will be ""buddying"" services for people needing mental health support and alternative accommodation for those in overcrowded homes. Social care support and translation services will also be available. It is hoped the schemes will encourage more people to get tested and self-isolate if required. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said this was ""vital"" in the fight against new Covid variants. ""Variants have the potential to be a Trojan horse for our hard won progress and it is more vital than ever that we do what we can to show them the exit door, following the rules and self-isolating when asked,"" he said. Will I get paid if I self-isolate? Few with Covid symptoms self-isolating, study finds How do I get my free Covid tests? How many people are being paid to self-isolate? The areas that will receive funding from a Â£12m pot for the pilots are: Newham and Hackney in London Yorkshire and Humber Lancashire, Blackburn & Darwen, Blackpool Greater Manchester Cheshire and Merseyside Royal Borough of Kingston Peterborough, Fenland and South Holland Somerset There will be language communications support for those who do not speak English as their first language, and social care support, such as increasing existing social care support for vulnerable adults. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: ""We recognise just how challenging self-isolation is for many people and these pilots will help us find the best ways to support people and making it easier for everyone to keep doing their bit."" However, people in pilot areas will not receive further financial support when self-isolating. Under current rules,a Â£500 grant has been made available,externalin England to people on low incomes who have to self-isolate.

GLOBAL SPREAD:How many worldwide cases are there? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters The government is already backing a pilot across the Greater Manchester region with Â£2m of funding to assess ways of helping people self-isolate. This includes ""support and engagement teams"" who work with households within 24 hours of a positive Covid test to develop a bespoke plan for self-isolation. James Jamieson, chairman of the Local Government Association, said rapidly targeting local outbreaks was crucial to tackling the spread of the virus. ""These pilot schemes will provide further insight into what works best in supporting those who test positive and their contacts to do the right thing to protect themselves, their families and their wider communities,"" he said. People who have tested positive for coronavirus and those considered at risk of having been exposed to it must self-isolate.

The figure includes 37.9 million people who have received a first dose - 72% of the UK adult population - and 22.6 million have had both (43%). The number of second doses administered in the UK hit a daily record on Saturday at 556,951. Dr Jenny Harries, chief executive of the UK Health Security Agency, said the possibility of restrictions being eased on 21 June - as planned under the government's road map out of lockdown - was ""looking good"". But she urged the public to be cautious to avoid another lockdown, warning that the new Indian variant has become the ""dominant strain"" in some parts of the country. Under the plans, from 21 June nightclubs would be allowed to reopen and restrictions on large events, such as festivals, would be lifted. Prof Adam Finn, a member of the government's Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, said there might be an ""adjustment"" to the lifting of restrictions on this date. He told Times Radio on Sunday: ""We're effectively in a race with the vaccine programme against the virus. ""We know that we're letting the virus out by spreading it about now, we know that we're progressing well with the vaccine programme, but I think there's going to need to be an adjustment of some sort.""

"Ariany spent 22 days in detention The US has a vast system of detention sites scattered across the country, holding more than 20,000 migrant children. In a special investigation, the BBC has uncovered allegations of cold temperatures, sickness, neglect, lice and filth, through a series of interviews with children and staff. It was midnight on the Rio Grande - the imposing river that forms the border between Texas and Mexico - and lights began to flash on the Mexican side. Voices could be heard in the darkness. Figures emerged, got into a small raft, and began to cross the river. As the raft appeared on the US side, the faces of the migrants became visible. More than half of them were children. Over March and April,more than 36,000 children,externalcrossed into the US unaccompanied by an adult. This was a record high for recent years. Many children travelling alone set out on their journey hoping to reunite with a parent already in the US. More than 80% of themalready have a family member in the country,external, the US government says. President Joe Biden has opened the border to unaccompanied children seeking asylum, somewhat relaxing former President Trump's policy of turning migrants away due to Covid-19. The children scrambled up the banks, exhausted. Two young cousins held hands. Another youth, Jordy, 17, said he had fled Guatemala because he was afraid of violent gangs operating there. But tonight he was frightened about what might await him in migrant detention centres in the US. He said he had heard stories about them. ""They will put us in an icebox and ask us questions,"" he said. The so-called ""iceboxes"", notorious among migrants, are extremely cold rooms or cubicles in US Border Patrol migrant processing facilities. Jordy said he was escaping gang violence Jordy was told to join a line with other children. US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) guards were taking the children's shoelaces and belts, a process usually reserved for prisoners to prevent them trying to take their own lives. Jordy and the other children were then taken away by bus into the night. They were to join more than 20,000 migrant children now in US detention, held in a series of extensive camps around the country, at least 13 of which are new. In late March, CBP releaseddisturbing imagesof cramped conditions within one particular facility it runs in Donna, Texas - a mass of enormous white tents looming above the small town. The facility was designed to hold 250 people but housed more than 4,000 at peak occupancy. The Donna temporary facility pictured in late March People are seen separated by plastic sheeting in makeshift rooms Journalists have not been allowed to talk to the children inside. Instead we have been tracking down the children who have been released, to find out about conditions in US detention sites. Ten-year-old Ariany, who crossed into the US alone, spent 22 days in detention this spring, most of them in the Donna camp. She was crammed into a plastic cubicle - as were scores of other children, from toddlers to teens - wrapped in a silver emergency blanket. ""We were very cold,"" she said. ""We had nowhere to sleep so we shared mats. We were five girls on two mats."" Ariany was finally reunited with her mother, Sonia, in late March. She had passed her mother's contact details onto US officials who were able to locate her. Sonia had fled Honduras six years ago with her son due to gang violence, leaving Ariany - who was too young at the time to make the journey - behind with her older sister. Cindy, 16, also held in Donna this spring, said there were 80 girls in her cubicle and that she and most of the children were wet under their blankets, due to dripping pipes. ""We all woke up wet."" She said. ""We slept on our sides, all hugged, so we stayed warm."" Cindy was held in a cubicle with 80 other girls A number of children, including Ariany and Paola, a 16-year-old also released from Donna, told the BBC that they were given food that had expired, or was rotten or not cooked properly. They told us that many children became sick. ""Some girls fainted,"" said Jennifer, who was 17 at the time of her detention. Some girls in Donna were able to shower once a week, but others said they did not shower for several weeks at a time. Paola struggled with the filth. ""I started to feel my head itching, and I realised that it was not normal. They checked my head and told me that I had lice."" This video can not be played âI didn't see the light of day.â Hear from children held inside US detention camps. With children eating and sleeping in close quarters, the cubicles quickly became rancid. Ten-year-old Ariany said the guards threatened the children if they did not keep their cramped quarters clean. ""Sometimes they would tell us that if we were doing a lot of mess, they were going to punish us by leaving us there more days,"" she said. At night, the children said, the tents were filled with the sounds of crying. ""We all cried, from the youngest up. There were two-year-old, or one-and-a-half-year-old babies, crying because they wanted their mother,"" said Cindy. Paola said she tried to help the younger ones, but was also worried that she herself would never be reunited with her mother. Paola, 16, said she tried to comfort others ""They cried in front of me, and I just tried to comfort them and tell them that one day we would get out of there - although sometimes inside me I had doubt, because [the staff] would not ask me for my mom's number, her address, and I felt bad too,"" she said. And then one day Cindy began to deteriorate and feel ill. She tested positive for Covid-19, as have a startling number of migrant children in detention. Health and Human Services (HHS) reports more than 3,000 coronavirus cases among migrant children in Texas alone since last year. It is not known what the total number of cases is in the new emergency detention sites around the country. Eventually Cindy, without being told where she was going, was transferred with 40 other Covid positive children onto bus, then plane, and flown 2,400km (1,500 miles) away to San Diego, California. They were taken to a new detention site - a convention centre with the capacity for almost 1,500 children - with row after row of flimsy camp beds. She says she was kept away from the healthy children, in a section full of children with Covid. She said conditions were better than at Donna, but it was still days before she was able to shower. Persecution, gang violence and organised crime, losses from natural disasters (including two Central American hurricanes in 2020), and poverty are all causing parents to send their children to seek refuge in the US. Migrants are vulnerable to exploitation and sexual abuse along the way Most areteenagers from Guatemala, Honduras or El Salvador,external, though some are reported to be as young assix or seven,external They are either sent by relatives on their own,or with people smugglers,externalwho charge thousands of dollars, though reports suggest some families accompany the children to the border and then send them across alone to improve their chances of US entry Most have family members already in the US, about half of whom are a parent Only 4.3% of unaccompanied minors seeking asylumhave been deported since 2014,external Every day, flights leave US border towns loaded with children. ""On some days we estimate that hundreds of children are being transported around the country on these flights,"" said Thomas Cartwright, of Witness at the Border, an organisation that logs the flights. A plane being loaded with migrant children In the past few weeks, the authorities have moved about 3,000 children out of the Border Patrol facility in Donna, transporting many to a new network of child detention centres around the country run by HHS, including the one Cindy was transferred to in San Diego. There are at least 13 such facilities, known as Emergency Intake Sites, on military bases, convention centres, or arenas in major US cities. These are a new part of a network of 200 detention centres for migrant children spread across 22 states. This means that Donna is far less crowded now, with the camp holding around 300 children. The facility is being expanded, as the influx of migrants across the border continues. One of the new Emergency Intake Sites is the Kay Bailey Hutchinson conference centre in central Dallas, which has 2,270 camp beds set up in a grid system in a huge hall, and held hundreds of teenage boys, aged 13-to-17, at its peak. Staff who work in the Dallas site say they have had to sign non-disclosure agreements specifying they are not to talk about what goes on inside. But some agreed to talk to us on condition of anonymity. ""The children always complain about not having enough, not eating enough,"" one staff member said. He also said the convention hall was cold, the boys had one thin blanket each, and were made to stay by their camp beds almost all day. ""Boys have been in there for 45 days straight with no sunlight, no recreation outside, no fresh air, no nothing,"" said the staff member. The moment Ariany reunited with her mother and brother He said that the boys were only given 30 minutes of recreation twice a week in an indoor room and many had been in the convention centre for weeks. ""They are all depressed. I heard the other day that several were contemplating suicide because of the conditions here. ""They are being treated like prisoners, like inmates,"" he said. ""It's haunting that this centre has not been able to meet the minimal standards of caring for unaccompanied minors."" In response to the allegations of neglect of migrant children in the new detention sites, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) said: ""The children are provided a safe and healthy environment with access to nutritious food, clean clothes, comfortable beds, education, recreational activities, and medical services."" ""The Dallas EIS (Emergency Intake Site) is providing required standards of care,"" the statement said. ""The entire administration is working together to reduce the length of time children are in federal custody by making unifications our top priority,"" it added, pointing out that the number of children in the care of the HHS has more than doubled. Children are being released regularly, but for many it is a very slow process. The average time in detention in the emergency centres is a month. The largest Emergency Intake Site is a tented facility at the Fort Bliss military base in El Paso, Texas, holding more than 4,500 children in the searing desert. It has a capacity for more than 10,000. A source inside has told the BBC that some of the tents contain 500-800 girls and boys who sleep in long rows of bunks. The source said hundreds of children are in Covid isolation, and that there are designated tents at the site now for scabies and lice, of which there are also outbreaks. Sources say the living conditions are unsanitary, and that there has been at least one report of sexual abuse in the girls' tent. An official document indicates children under six may be sent to Fort Bliss. The HHS did not respond to a BBC request for comment on these allegations. Amy Cohen, a psychiatrist based on the other side of the country in Los Angeles, has more than 30 years of experience working with traumatised children. She said the alleged conditions in the camps could be extremely damaging for those inside. ""Even after weeks in these conditions, many children are at greater risk of developing major psychiatric illnesses later in life, at greater risk of substance abuse and a greater risk of suicide,"" she said. Cohen said these migrant children would be even more vulnerable because many had been separated from a non-parental family member, or someone they came to rely on as a family member, at the border. ""If a child comes over with someone who is not their biological parent, even if they are their psychological parent, they are uniformly taken away from that individual, taken out of their laps, taken out of their arms, and called an unaccompanied minor."" She also said parents were being forced to make the decision to separate themselves from their children, because families who are turned away often then send their children back across the border alone, rather than risk their welfare in dangerous cities along the Mexican border. There, she says, they are vulnerable to rape, trafficking and assault. ""So these parents, when they find they're unable to protect their children, end up feeling forced to send their children by themselves across the river, in order to preserve their lives."" Cohen said that although children were no longer being physically taken from their biological parents by border guards - as had happened for a time under former President Trump's so-called ""zero tolerance policy"" - the process of family separation was deeply psychologically damaging. ""I interviewed children who were removed from parents under the Trump administration's 'zero tolerance' policyâ¦ and I've interviewed many children who've been now taken away from aunts, and uncles, and siblingsâ¦ I am seeing exactly the same trauma in these children now as we saw in those children then."" The CPB told the BBC that under federal law any child arriving without a parent or legal guardian was considered unaccompanied and must be transferred to the HHS without the adult relative.

"The raid happened days after Arundel Castle reopened on Tuesday A set of gold rosary beads carried by Mary Queen of Scots at her execution in 1587 was among items worth more than Â£1m stolen in a raid on Arundel Castle. The gold and silver artefacts were snatched from the West Sussex castle on Friday night. Other pieces taken during the raid include coronation cups given by Mary to the Earl Marshal. An Arundel Castle spokesman said the stolen items were of ""priceless historical importance"". The castle only reopened to the public on Tuesday. Staff were alerted to the break-in at 22:30 BST on Friday after a burglar alarm went off. Sussex Police told the BBC the thieves entered through a window and smashed a glass cabinet to grab the items. Det Con Molly O'Malley said the force thinks a 4x4 saloon found abandoned and on fire in nearby Barlavington ""was linked"" to the raid. The castle spokesman said the rosary had ""little intrinsic value as metal"" but was ""irreplaceable"". The rosary beads were carried by Mary as she was led to her death A spokesman for Arundel Castle Trustees said: ""The stolen items have significant monetary value, but as unique artefacts of the Duke of Norfolk's collection have immeasurably greater and priceless historical importance. ""We therefore urge anyone with information to come forward to the police to assist them in returning these treasures back where they belong."" Peter Squires, professor of criminology at the University of Brighton, said there was a ""surprising amount"" of thefts of ""antiquities or cultural artefacts"". He said items were often stolen to order and end up in the private collections of very rich people. He told BBC Radio Sussex: ""In war zones in the Middle East, there is a lot of evidence of museums being looted and the stolen items quickly finding themselves on to the dark web where they are bid on by dealers. ""Gold of course may just be melted down, which massively reduces its value, so to find someone who wants the items rather than just the bullion value is the thieves' objective here."" The items were taken from a display cabinet, police say Professor Kate Williams of Reading University said: ""When [Mary] fled Scotland into England most of her belongings were despoiled and shared out. ""Then after she was executed, nearly everything she had was taken and burned because people were concerned she would turn into a Catholic martyr. ""So we had one tiny memorial of Mary Queen of Scots - and now it has gone."" Det Con O'Malley urged people who were in Arundel on Friday evening and saw any suspicious activity around the area of the castle to contact the force either online or by calling 101, quoting Operation Deuce. ""The castle only re-opened to visitors on Tuesday 18 May, so if you were visiting during the past few days do you on reflection recall anyone behaving at all suspiciously?"" he said. Mary Queen of Scots was held in captivity for 18 years before she was executed Mary was born at Linlithgow Palace in 1542 and became queen when her father died soon after her birth However, Mary was taken to France in 1548 and Scotland was ruled by regents She returned in 1561 to begin her reign as Queen of Scots but was forced to abdicate at the age of 24 after six tumultuous years After an unsuccessful attempt to regain the throne, Mary fled to England seeking the protection of her cousin, Elizabeth I Mary had once claimed Elizabeth's throne as her own and was considered the legitimate sovereign by many English Catholics The Scots queen was held in captivity for 18 years before she was executed at Fotheringhay Castle in 1587, at the age of 44 Her son James became king of Scotland and England Mary, Queen of Scots film 'problematic' Mary Queen of Scots documents found Fierce winds threaten more fire destruction as LA struggles to contain blazes Powerful images of loss and heroism from LA UK has enough gas says No 10 after storage warning What's the latest on the Los Angeles wildfires and what caused them?

"Ariany spent 22 days in detention The US has a vast system of detention sites scattered across the country, holding more than 20,000 migrant children. In a special investigation, the BBC has uncovered allegations of cold temperatures, sickness, neglect, lice and filth, through a series of interviews with children and staff. It was midnight on the Rio Grande - the imposing river that forms the border between Texas and Mexico - and lights began to flash on the Mexican side. Voices could be heard in the darkness. Figures emerged, got into a small raft, and began to cross the river. As the raft appeared on the US side, the faces of the migrants became visible. More than half of them were children. Over March and April,more than 36,000 children,externalcrossed into the US unaccompanied by an adult. This was a record high for recent years. Many children travelling alone set out on their journey hoping to reunite with a parent already in the US. More than 80% of themalready have a family member in the country,external, the US government says. President Joe Biden has opened the border to unaccompanied children seeking asylum, somewhat relaxing former President Trump's policy of turning migrants away due to Covid-19. The children scrambled up the banks, exhausted. Two young cousins held hands. Another youth, Jordy, 17, said he had fled Guatemala because he was afraid of violent gangs operating there. But tonight he was frightened about what might await him in migrant detention centres in the US. He said he had heard stories about them. ""They will put us in an icebox and ask us questions,"" he said. The so-called ""iceboxes"", notorious among migrants, are extremely cold rooms or cubicles in US Border Patrol migrant processing facilities. Jordy said he was escaping gang violence Jordy was told to join a line with other children. US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) guards were taking the children's shoelaces and belts, a process usually reserved for prisoners to prevent them trying to take their own lives. Jordy and the other children were then taken away by bus into the night. They were to join more than 20,000 migrant children now in US detention, held in a series of extensive camps around the country, at least 13 of which are new. In late March, CBP releaseddisturbing imagesof cramped conditions within one particular facility it runs in Donna, Texas - a mass of enormous white tents looming above the small town. The facility was designed to hold 250 people but housed more than 4,000 at peak occupancy. The Donna temporary facility pictured in late March People are seen separated by plastic sheeting in makeshift rooms Journalists have not been allowed to talk to the children inside. Instead we have been tracking down the children who have been released, to find out about conditions in US detention sites. Ten-year-old Ariany, who crossed into the US alone, spent 22 days in detention this spring, most of them in the Donna camp. She was crammed into a plastic cubicle - as were scores of other children, from toddlers to teens - wrapped in a silver emergency blanket. ""We were very cold,"" she said. ""We had nowhere to sleep so we shared mats. We were five girls on two mats."" Ariany was finally reunited with her mother, Sonia, in late March. She had passed her mother's contact details onto US officials who were able to locate her. Sonia had fled Honduras six years ago with her son due to gang violence, leaving Ariany - who was too young at the time to make the journey - behind with her older sister. Cindy, 16, also held in Donna this spring, said there were 80 girls in her cubicle and that she and most of the children were wet under their blankets, due to dripping pipes. ""We all woke up wet."" She said. ""We slept on our sides, all hugged, so we stayed warm."" Cindy was held in a cubicle with 80 other girls A number of children, including Ariany and Paola, a 16-year-old also released from Donna, told the BBC that they were given food that had expired, or was rotten or not cooked properly. They told us that many children became sick. ""Some girls fainted,"" said Jennifer, who was 17 at the time of her detention. Some girls in Donna were able to shower once a week, but others said they did not shower for several weeks at a time. Paola struggled with the filth. ""I started to feel my head itching, and I realised that it was not normal. They checked my head and told me that I had lice."" This video can not be played âI didn't see the light of day.â Hear from children held inside US detention camps. With children eating and sleeping in close quarters, the cubicles quickly became rancid. Ten-year-old Ariany said the guards threatened the children if they did not keep their cramped quarters clean. ""Sometimes they would tell us that if we were doing a lot of mess, they were going to punish us by leaving us there more days,"" she said. At night, the children said, the tents were filled with the sounds of crying. ""We all cried, from the youngest up. There were two-year-old, or one-and-a-half-year-old babies, crying because they wanted their mother,"" said Cindy. Paola said she tried to help the younger ones, but was also worried that she herself would never be reunited with her mother. Paola, 16, said she tried to comfort others ""They cried in front of me, and I just tried to comfort them and tell them that one day we would get out of there - although sometimes inside me I had doubt, because [the staff] would not ask me for my mom's number, her address, and I felt bad too,"" she said. And then one day Cindy began to deteriorate and feel ill. She tested positive for Covid-19, as have a startling number of migrant children in detention. Health and Human Services (HHS) reports more than 3,000 coronavirus cases among migrant children in Texas alone since last year. It is not known what the total number of cases is in the new emergency detention sites around the country. Eventually Cindy, without being told where she was going, was transferred with 40 other Covid positive children onto bus, then plane, and flown 2,400km (1,500 miles) away to San Diego, California. They were taken to a new detention site - a convention centre with the capacity for almost 1,500 children - with row after row of flimsy camp beds. She says she was kept away from the healthy children, in a section full of children with Covid. She said conditions were better than at Donna, but it was still days before she was able to shower. Persecution, gang violence and organised crime, losses from natural disasters (including two Central American hurricanes in 2020), and poverty are all causing parents to send their children to seek refuge in the US. Migrants are vulnerable to exploitation and sexual abuse along the way Most areteenagers from Guatemala, Honduras or El Salvador,external, though some are reported to be as young assix or seven,external They are either sent by relatives on their own,or with people smugglers,externalwho charge thousands of dollars, though reports suggest some families accompany the children to the border and then send them across alone to improve their chances of US entry Most have family members already in the US, about half of whom are a parent Only 4.3% of unaccompanied minors seeking asylumhave been deported since 2014,external Every day, flights leave US border towns loaded with children. ""On some days we estimate that hundreds of children are being transported around the country on these flights,"" said Thomas Cartwright, of Witness at the Border, an organisation that logs the flights. A plane being loaded with migrant children In the past few weeks, the authorities have moved about 3,000 children out of the Border Patrol facility in Donna, transporting many to a new network of child detention centres around the country run by HHS, including the one Cindy was transferred to in San Diego. There are at least 13 such facilities, known as Emergency Intake Sites, on military bases, convention centres, or arenas in major US cities. These are a new part of a network of 200 detention centres for migrant children spread across 22 states. This means that Donna is far less crowded now, with the camp holding around 300 children. The facility is being expanded, as the influx of migrants across the border continues. One of the new Emergency Intake Sites is the Kay Bailey Hutchinson conference centre in central Dallas, which has 2,270 camp beds set up in a grid system in a huge hall, and held hundreds of teenage boys, aged 13-to-17, at its peak. Staff who work in the Dallas site say they have had to sign non-disclosure agreements specifying they are not to talk about what goes on inside. But some agreed to talk to us on condition of anonymity. ""The children always complain about not having enough, not eating enough,"" one staff member said. He also said the convention hall was cold, the boys had one thin blanket each, and were made to stay by their camp beds almost all day. ""Boys have been in there for 45 days straight with no sunlight, no recreation outside, no fresh air, no nothing,"" said the staff member. The moment Ariany reunited with her mother and brother He said that the boys were only given 30 minutes of recreation twice a week in an indoor room and many had been in the convention centre for weeks. ""They are all depressed. I heard the other day that several were contemplating suicide because of the conditions here. ""They are being treated like prisoners, like inmates,"" he said. ""It's haunting that this centre has not been able to meet the minimal standards of caring for unaccompanied minors."" In response to the allegations of neglect of migrant children in the new detention sites, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) said: ""The children are provided a safe and healthy environment with access to nutritious food, clean clothes, comfortable beds, education, recreational activities, and medical services."" ""The Dallas EIS (Emergency Intake Site) is providing required standards of care,"" the statement said. ""The entire administration is working together to reduce the length of time children are in federal custody by making unifications our top priority,"" it added, pointing out that the number of children in the care of the HHS has more than doubled. Children are being released regularly, but for many it is a very slow process. The average time in detention in the emergency centres is a month. The largest Emergency Intake Site is a tented facility at the Fort Bliss military base in El Paso, Texas, holding more than 4,500 children in the searing desert. It has a capacity for more than 10,000. A source inside has told the BBC that some of the tents contain 500-800 girls and boys who sleep in long rows of bunks. The source said hundreds of children are in Covid isolation, and that there are designated tents at the site now for scabies and lice, of which there are also outbreaks. Sources say the living conditions are unsanitary, and that there has been at least one report of sexual abuse in the girls' tent. An official document indicates children under six may be sent to Fort Bliss. The HHS did not respond to a BBC request for comment on these allegations. Amy Cohen, a psychiatrist based on the other side of the country in Los Angeles, has more than 30 years of experience working with traumatised children. She said the alleged conditions in the camps could be extremely damaging for those inside. ""Even after weeks in these conditions, many children are at greater risk of developing major psychiatric illnesses later in life, at greater risk of substance abuse and a greater risk of suicide,"" she said. Cohen said these migrant children would be even more vulnerable because many had been separated from a non-parental family member, or someone they came to rely on as a family member, at the border. ""If a child comes over with someone who is not their biological parent, even if they are their psychological parent, they are uniformly taken away from that individual, taken out of their laps, taken out of their arms, and called an unaccompanied minor."" She also said parents were being forced to make the decision to separate themselves from their children, because families who are turned away often then send their children back across the border alone, rather than risk their welfare in dangerous cities along the Mexican border. There, she says, they are vulnerable to rape, trafficking and assault. ""So these parents, when they find they're unable to protect their children, end up feeling forced to send their children by themselves across the river, in order to preserve their lives."" Cohen said that although children were no longer being physically taken from their biological parents by border guards - as had happened for a time under former President Trump's so-called ""zero tolerance policy"" - the process of family separation was deeply psychologically damaging. ""I interviewed children who were removed from parents under the Trump administration's 'zero tolerance' policyâ¦ and I've interviewed many children who've been now taken away from aunts, and uncles, and siblingsâ¦ I am seeing exactly the same trauma in these children now as we saw in those children then."" The CPB told the BBC that under federal law any child arriving without a parent or legal guardian was considered unaccompanied and must be transferred to the HHS without the adult relative. Has suspended the Migrant Protection Protocols programme, also known as the Remain in Mexico policy, which required migrants to wait in Mexico while their cases were being heard by US immigration courts. Has gradually admitted those already enrolled in the programme to wait in the US while their cases are heard, while stressing that the border remains closed for others. Has created a taskforce to reunite families who were divided during Trump's so-called ""zero tolerance"" policy Has paused construction on the Mexican border wall, and has proposed a major new immigration bill which would offer a pathway to citizenship for undocumented migrants already living in the US Read more here A pandemic health order,externalmeans that large numbers of adults and families are still being turned away at the border, and Mr Biden has urged migrants not to make the dangerous journey. But the Biden administration has allowed unaccompanied children under the age of 18 and, more recentlya small number of families with young children,,externalto enter the US while their claims are processed. In addition, it was announced last week that the US would also process250 asylum seekers a day,externalwho are deemed particularly vulnerable. Many children are travelling to meet family, spurred on by a widespread rumour that Mr Biden has taken massive strides to welcome immigrants, and reverse the immigration crackdown of his predecessor. Republican Beth Van Duyne, the congressional representative for Texas, said Mr Biden's policy of allowing children to cross the border alone was to blame for the crisis. ""[The administration] are absolutely incentivising the separation of families,"" she said. ""None of these centres are equipped to take care of children,"" added Van Duyne, who has visited at least two of the state's detention centres. But Democrat Congresswoman Sylvia R. Garcia, who has visited several sites, says the administration has taken significant strides to improve conditions for children. ""Yes there are [issues], but I'm telling you that based on what I'm seeing and ones I've visited the administration is doing much better than it did before when the surge started, because they were not prepared for the sheer numbers and they did not have the facilities in place, and they do now."" The core of the problem is that the number of migrant children arriving in the US, either with their families or alone, has been rising steadily over the past decade and the US does not have an efficient system in place to reunite migrant children with their US-based family members, critics say. ""Children arriving to the United States are being needlessly traumatised due to the long-standing failure of the US to build a modern border management system that recognises 21st Century migration trends,"" said Warren Binford, of the Willamette University College of Law. Ariany, the 10-year-old who was held in the Donna tents for weeks, later drew pictures while she was in another shelter, of love hearts and flowers. Sonia says her daughter has changed ""I made them because I was sad,"" she told us. She showed us the words she had written in Spanish by her drawing. ""It says, 'I love you, Mom. I love you all.'"" Ariany's mother says her daughter, once a bubbly, sociable girl, has changed since her time in detention. ""She's very quiet, she hardly speaks. She can't stand children near her right now."" ""The children we worry about most are the children who go quiet,"" said Amy Cohen, child trauma specialist. She says the danger, particularly for the youngest children, is that ""the trauma goes underground, it sits like land mines under the surface"". Now Ariany has nightmares. ""She's very afraid of going to sleep. She wakes up crying, screaming,"" said her mother Sonia. Paola said she cried when she came home at all times of night and day, and she also had difficulties sleeping. ""I don't think anyone in this countryâ¦ deserves to be treated like this,"" she said. ""Sometimes I pretended to be strong, because in this life you have to be strong. But this kind of thing leaves our hearts marked because even If we overcome it, we always remember.""

"The UK's energy regulator has approved plans to invest Â£300m in low carbon projects including support for 3,550 charging points for electric vehicles. Ofgem said the funds would allow energy networks to build robust electricity infrastructure for installing charging points across UK motorways. It said while more people are buying electric cars, others are put off due to a lack of charging points near home. Ofgem said a wider charging network would help address ""range anxiety"". The new funding will support the infrastructure needed to support 1,800 new ultra-rapid charging points at motorway service areas. There are currently 918 ultra-rapid charge points in the UK which can add a range of 100 miles to an electric car in around 30 minutes. The investment will also allow an additional 1,750 rapid charging points to be installed. In addition to motorways, cities and train stations will also see increased network capacity to support more charging points. Car buyers still sceptical about electric - Ford Electric cars ditched over lack of chargers in NI In total, the UK has nearly 24,000 charging points, which have more than 41,000 connectors - or cables - that can be plugged into an electric car, according to electric vehicle app and website Zap-Map. ""As drivers make the switch from petrol and diesel to electric, Britain's cables, substations and other infrastructure need a massive upgrade to support this new demand for electricity,"" Ofgem said. When it comes to public charging points for electric cars, the UK isn't doing too badly. According to Zap-Map, there are nearly 24,000 chargers installed around the country. That's less than half the number available in the Netherlands, but not far short of what France and Germany have to offer. It's also more than double the number available in 2018. But with the sale of new petrol and diesel cars to be banned from 2030, more infrastructure is needed, and Ofgem has acknowledged that fact. Today's announcement is not a game changer, but rather a statement of intent. Some 1,800 ultra-fast chargers, capable of charging car batteries in minutes rather than hours, will be installed across the motorway network - as reassurance for electric vehicle drivers who want to embark on long journeys. The Â£300m investment is, relatively speaking, a drop in the ocean. But it forms part of a much bigger Â£40bn investment programme for the energy network as a whole approved last year. It's likely a much more significant portion of those funds will ultimately be allocated towards getting the country ready for electric vehicles. The investment, which will be made over two years, will also support the provision of more ""clean"", low carbon electric heating for homes and businesses. Sales of new cars powered solely by petrol or diesel will be banned in the UK from 2030. A recent report by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) found that while demand for electric vehicles is growing in the UK - accounting for one in 10 car registrations last year - it was mainly fuelled by businesses or buyers of fleets. ""Just 4.6% of new consumer vehicles were battery powered,"" it said. So far, the installation of charging points has mainly been concentrated in London and the South East. Ofgem said the investment by energy networks would support more ultra-rapid charge points in cities such as Glasgow, Kirkwall, Warrington, Llandudno, York and Truro. While the number of charging points in the UK is growing, it is still far short of the estimated 2.7 million the SMMT said the country would need by 2030, the vast majority of which need to be available for people who park their cars on a nearby street at home. ""Drivers need certainty that they can recharge their vehicle conveniently and on demand,"" it said. ""For many, that means using a charging point at home. ""However, at least one in three households rely on on-street parking as they have no driveway or garage and still more have no designated off-street parking."" The SMMT said that to accommodate these drivers ""there must be a commitment to expand on-street public charging in residential areas"".

"The World Health Organization's head says all health workers and elderly worldwide would be vaccinated by now if jabs were shared fairly Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus says governments vaccinating low risk groups do so at the expense of vulnerable people elsewhere He says the world should do a ""massive push to vaccinate at least 10% of the population of every country by September"" British tourists can now enter Spain without any restrictions, but UK rules mean they must still take tests and quarantine when they're back ""We are not trying to rush into this... we have learnt from the pandemic,"" says Spain's tourism minister Fernando ValdÃ©s Statistics show overseas visitors to the UK fell by about three-quarters in 2020 - as did overseas travel by UK residents The number of coronavirus deaths in India passes 300,000, although experts say the number could be much higher Lockdown rules are easing in Northern Ireland - with indoor socialising in groups of up to six allowed and pubs reopening inside More than 250 pupils are isolating after 26 positive cases were confirmed at a school in Porthcawl, south Wales Edited by James Clarke And that's it from us today. This coverage has been brought to you by Francesca Gillett, Doug Faulkner, Jennifer Meierhans, Rob Corp and James Clarke. Thanks for joining us and we will be back again tomorrow to bring you the latest coronavirus news from across the world. A medical worker injects a man with a dose of the Covid-19 vaccine at a hospital in Accra, capital of Ghana as part of the Covax scheme We're about to bring our coverage to a close but here is a little reminder of some of today's headlines from around the world:   A secondary school in Middlesbrough is closing for the rest of the week following a number of positive Covid cases. Students at The King's Academy in Coulby Newham will continue their learning online after Middlesbrough Council closed the school after Covid infections were found in all year groups. A mobile testing unit will soon be set up in the grounds with all students and staff encouraged to have a PCR test. Principal David Dawes says: ""We've acted quickly in response to a small number of cases. We will always put the safety of the wider community first."" Clackmannanshire has overtaken Glasgow City as having the highest Covid rate in Scotland. New figures show the region had a seven-day average rate of 139.7 cases per 100,000 people compared to Glasgow City's 136.8. The equivalent case rate for the whole of the UK is 23 per 100,000 people Glasgow is the only part of Scotland under level three Covid restrictions. Health Secretary Humza Yousaf says: ""Clackmannanshire has a really small population, so even four, five, six households testing positive can really make the numbers look like they're shooting up. But it is a concerning situation."" Residents have been encouraged to take a Covid test and extra test facilities have been set up. You can read morehere. Here are the latest graphs showing the progress of the pandemic in the UK. As you can see deaths from Covid-19 remain at low levels while the number of cases is leveling off. There is no ""plan B"" for fans inside Hampden at Euro 2020 if Glasgow remains in Scottish government level three restrictions, says the Scottish Football Association. Doubts exist over whether supporters will still be allowed in for the four matches at Scotland's national stadium. A minimum crowd of 12,000 has been agreed with Uefa for those games, butno fans were allowed to attend Saturday's Scottish Cup final. ""The games will be at Hampden,"" says SFA chief executive Ian Maxwell. ""There can't be any plan B in terms of spectators because of ticket sales and stadium processes and all of those things, but hopefully we don't need to get to that point."" Maxwell says the SFA is in daily contact with the Scottish government about the Covid-19 situation in Glasgow. The local authority area is currentlythe only one in Scotland in level three,meaning large crowds are prohibited in the city. Northern Ireland is the latest UK nation to update its rules on weddings. From today, there is no government limit on the number of people allowed at wedding ceremonies in NI. But that doesn't mean you can have unlimited numbers - instead, the limit depends on how many people each venue can safely accommodate. Face masks must also be worn by guests in the ceremony, and while receptions can go ahead, there are some rules. Tables must be no bigger than 10 guests (except for the top table), the wedding couple can only have one dance and live music is not allowed. The rules in England and Wales currently limit the total number of people to 30, while in Scotland the limit is 50 providing people can socially distance. For more information on the latest rules, head here. Chris JeavansBBC News Bolton, Blackburn and
Bedford accounted for almost 900 cases of the variant first identified in
India, in the latest week of available data. Genomic analysis by theSanger Institute,externalfor the week of 9-15 May, found a total of 1,900 cases of
the B.1.617.2 variant across England. Of these, 611 were in
Bolton, 145 in Blackburn with Darwen and 126 in Bedford. All regions of England saw
some cases of the variant, with numbers and rates generally highest in the
North West - as seen on this map. Sequencing positive
coronavirus test results to find out which variant they contain takes several
days so there is always a lag in the data. However, this picture is
broadly similar to the findings Public Health England put out at the
weekend. PHE also found almost
half of all the coronavirus cases it had sequenced in the most recent week were
B.1.617.2 and that prevalence of the variant had risen rapidly. Marilyn Muldoon is looking forward to being reunited with cat Queenie who has a pet passport A British couple who rent a house in Spain say they will attempt to drive over to collect their belongings and their cat now that Spain has opened its borders to UK travellers. Marilyn Muldoon from Westwoodside, North
Lincolnshire, says she and her husband had rented a house in Pruna, between Malaga and Seville, for a year last July. They returned home for Christmas but were not able to get back after the UK went into another lockdown and international travel was banned. With their tenancy up in July, they want to go back and collect their things and cat Queenie who is being looked after by a neighbour, but say they are confused by travel advice. Marilyn says: ""We've no idea what news to believe or even how to go about
trying to find the right information. Itâs been the waiting. Even when people
tell you on the news, itâs still confusing. Spain is on the amber list, so you
can go but youâre not meant to."" She says they will set off in the next week by ferry to Santander and have ""no objections"" to quarantining when they get back. A further three deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test have been reported across the UK. There were also a further 2,439 positive cases identified,according to the latest figures,external. An additional 126,357 people received their first dose of a vaccination, while 252,139 received a second jab. This video can not be played Members of the amateur choir say the rules need changing so they can perform indoors. Members of an amateur choir in North Yorkshire are among a chorus of voices across the country calling for a change in Covid restrictions to allow them to perform. Current Covid guidelines state choirs can only perform or rehearse indoors in groups of no more than six. Craig Ratcliffe, musical director of Tadcaster Community Choir, says: ""There's not been consideration for the differences that choirs can have"". Meanwhile, the chair of the choir, Celia Oldroyd, says not being able to perform is ""depressing"". The Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport says it understands it is ""disappointing"" but ""we are taking decisions based on the advice of our public health experts"". There are reports in India that a couple chartered a plane to hold a mid-air wedding with more than 160 guests in an effort to escape Covid restrictions. Video footage posted on social media appearsto show the couple and their guests packed into a hired jet. The state of Tamil Nadu, where the flight is said to have originated, recently imposed tougher restrictions, limiting weddings to 50 guests. India's aviation authority has launched an investigation, reports say. An official from the Directorate General of Civil Aviation tells the Times of India the SpiceJet staff aboard the flight had been taken off duty. A SpiceJet spokesperson tells the Indian Express the Boeing 737 was booked from Madurai to Bangalore by a travel agent for a trip after a wedding. The spokesperson says the client was ""clearly briefed on Covid guidelines to be followed and denied permission for any activity to be performed on board"".

In total 267 out of about 400 pupils have been sent home from West Park Primary, in Porthcawl, south Wales. Bridgend Council says parents have ""been advised to remain alert"" and online learning is being arranged. A spokesman says four staff and 22 pupils had tested positive. They say ""all staff and most pupils"" in year one were affected. There were also cases among pupils ""in nursery, reception, year two and year threeâ³, theLocal Democracy Reporting Servicesays. The council says 68 brothers and sisters of the pupils sent home have also been told to isolate, meaning a total of 335 people are home learning. More than 1.5 billion doses of coronavirus vaccines have been administered, in at least 189 countries worldwide. However, there are vast differences in the pace of progress in different parts of the world. The UK, for example, is on the brink of vaccinating its under-30s, while some countries are still waiting for their first shipments. Earlier, the head of the World Health Organization said the unequal distribution of vaccines was ""scandalous"". Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the gap was making the global pandemic worse - and that 75% of all doses have gone to just 10 countries. Many poorer countries are relying on deliveries from Covax. Dr Tedros has told rich countries to start donating some of their doses now - rather than waiting for surplus - and asked pharmaceutical companies to give the WHO first refusal on all new batches of vaccine. The aim is to vaccinate 10% of every countryâs population by September, he says. Read more about vaccination worldwide here. People ""should be worried"" about a resurgence in Covid, the Welsh government's chief medical officer says. Dr Frank Atherton says a spike in the Indian variant to ""around 57"" cases from 28 last Thursday is ""something we need to watch very carefully"". He says most of these cases were in Cardiff and the Vale of Glamorgan, although they have been identified in all health board areas apart from Powys. He says measures such as social distancing and using face coverings were ""the things that keep us safe"" and there was a risk the situation could ""go into reverse"" if those measures were relaxed. ""The public should be worried about the resurgence in coronavirus in general really,"" he says. ""We have a small number of cases - 57 at the moment of the so-called Indian variant - but that will be an underestimate and I expect the numbers to rise."" Read more. About half the people who were due to get a Covid jab at a mass vaccination centre in Glasgow failed to turn up over the weekend. The BBC has learned a ""considerable"" number of no shows were recorded on both Saturday and Sunday at the Hydro. The venue can administer a minimum of 4,000 vaccinations each day, with a capacity to scale up to 10,000. Glasgow has the highest coronavirus rates in the country at 133 cases per 100,000 people in the seven days to 20 May. It is the only council area in Scotland under level three Covid restrictions and people aged 18 to 39 in certain postcode areas are being offered jabs early to tackle surging cases.

Doubts exist over whether supporters will still be allowed in for the four matches at Scotland's national stadium. A minimum crowd of 12,000 has been agreed with Uefa for those games, butno fans were allowed to attend Saturday's Scottish Cup final. ""The games will be at Hampden,"" says SFA chief executive Ian Maxwell. ""There can't be any plan B in terms of spectators because of ticket sales and stadium processes and all of those things, but hopefully we don't need to get to that point.""

From today, there is no government limit on the number of people allowed at wedding ceremonies in NI. But that doesn't mean you can have unlimited numbers - instead, the limit depends on how many people each venue can safely accommodate. Face masks must also be worn by guests in the ceremony, and while receptions can go ahead, there are some rules. Tables must be no bigger than 10 guests (except for the top table), the wedding couple can only have one dance and live music is not allowed.

"Ariany spent 22 days in detention The US has a vast system of detention sites scattered across the country, holding more than 20,000 migrant children. In a special investigation, the BBC has uncovered allegations of cold temperatures, sickness, neglect, lice and filth, through a series of interviews with children and staff. It was midnight on the Rio Grande - the imposing river that forms the border between Texas and Mexico - and lights began to flash on the Mexican side. Voices could be heard in the darkness. Figures emerged, got into a small raft, and began to cross the river. As the raft appeared on the US side, the faces of the migrants became visible. More than half of them were children. Over March and April,more than 36,000 children,externalcrossed into the US unaccompanied by an adult. This was a record high for recent years. Many children travelling alone set out on their journey hoping to reunite with a parent already in the US. More than 80% of themalready have a family member in the country,external, the US government says. President Joe Biden has opened the border to unaccompanied children seeking asylum, somewhat relaxing former President Trump's policy of turning migrants away due to Covid-19. The children scrambled up the banks, exhausted. Two young cousins held hands. Another youth, Jordy, 17, said he had fled Guatemala because he was afraid of violent gangs operating there. But tonight he was frightened about what might await him in migrant detention centres in the US. He said he had heard stories about them. ""They will put us in an icebox and ask us questions,"" he said. The so-called ""iceboxes"", notorious among migrants, are extremely cold rooms or cubicles in US Border Patrol migrant processing facilities. Jordy said he was escaping gang violence Jordy was told to join a line with other children. US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) guards were taking the children's shoelaces and belts, a process usually reserved for prisoners to prevent them trying to take their own lives. Jordy and the other children were then taken away by bus into the night. They were to join more than 20,000 migrant children now in US detention, held in a series of extensive camps around the country, at least 13 of which are new. In late March, CBP releaseddisturbing imagesof cramped conditions within one particular facility it runs in Donna, Texas - a mass of enormous white tents looming above the small town. The facility was designed to hold 250 people but housed more than 4,000 at peak occupancy. The Donna temporary facility pictured in late March People are seen separated by plastic sheeting in makeshift rooms Journalists have not been allowed to talk to the children inside. Instead we have been tracking down the children who have been released, to find out about conditions in US detention sites. Ten-year-old Ariany, who crossed into the US alone, spent 22 days in detention this spring, most of them in the Donna camp. She was crammed into a plastic cubicle - as were scores of other children, from toddlers to teens - wrapped in a silver emergency blanket. ""We were very cold,"" she said. ""We had nowhere to sleep so we shared mats. We were five girls on two mats."" Ariany was finally reunited with her mother, Sonia, in late March. She had passed her mother's contact details onto US officials who were able to locate her. Sonia had fled Honduras six years ago with her son due to gang violence, leaving Ariany - who was too young at the time to make the journey - behind with her older sister. Cindy, 16, also held in Donna this spring, said there were 80 girls in her cubicle and that she and most of the children were wet under their blankets, due to dripping pipes. ""We all woke up wet."" She said. ""We slept on our sides, all hugged, so we stayed warm."" Cindy was held in a cubicle with 80 other girls A number of children, including Ariany and Paola, a 16-year-old also released from Donna, told the BBC that they were given food that had expired, or was rotten or not cooked properly. They told us that many children became sick. ""Some girls fainted,"" said Jennifer, who was 17 at the time of her detention. Some girls in Donna were able to shower once a week, but others said they did not shower for several weeks at a time. Paola struggled with the filth. ""I started to feel my head itching, and I realised that it was not normal. They checked my head and told me that I had lice."" This video can not be played âI didn't see the light of day.â Hear from children held inside US detention camps. With children eating and sleeping in close quarters, the cubicles quickly became rancid. Ten-year-old Ariany said the guards threatened the children if they did not keep their cramped quarters clean. ""Sometimes they would tell us that if we were doing a lot of mess, they were going to punish us by leaving us there more days,"" she said. At night, the children said, the tents were filled with the sounds of crying. ""We all cried, from the youngest up. There were two-year-old, or one-and-a-half-year-old babies, crying because they wanted their mother,"" said Cindy. Paola said she tried to help the younger ones, but was also worried that she herself would never be reunited with her mother. Paola, 16, said she tried to comfort others ""They cried in front of me, and I just tried to comfort them and tell them that one day we would get out of there - although sometimes inside me I had doubt, because [the staff] would not ask me for my mom's number, her address, and I felt bad too,"" she said. And then one day Cindy began to deteriorate and feel ill. She tested positive for Covid-19, as have a startling number of migrant children in detention. Health and Human Services (HHS) reports more than 3,000 coronavirus cases among migrant children in Texas alone since last year. It is not known what the total number of cases is in the new emergency detention sites around the country. Eventually Cindy, without being told where she was going, was transferred with 40 other Covid positive children onto bus, then plane, and flown 2,400km (1,500 miles) away to San Diego, California. They were taken to a new detention site - a convention centre with the capacity for almost 1,500 children - with row after row of flimsy camp beds. She says she was kept away from the healthy children, in a section full of children with Covid. She said conditions were better than at Donna, but it was still days before she was able to shower. Persecution, gang violence and organised crime, losses from natural disasters (including two Central American hurricanes in 2020), and poverty are all causing parents to send their children to seek refuge in the US. Migrants are vulnerable to exploitation and sexual abuse along the way Most areteenagers from Guatemala, Honduras or El Salvador,external, though some are reported to be as young assix or seven,external They are either sent by relatives on their own,or with people smugglers,externalwho charge thousands of dollars, though reports suggest some families accompany the children to the border and then send them across alone to improve their chances of US entry Most have family members already in the US, about half of whom are a parent Only 4.3% of unaccompanied minors seeking asylumhave been deported since 2014,external Every day, flights leave US border towns loaded with children. ""On some days we estimate that hundreds of children are being transported around the country on these flights,"" said Thomas Cartwright, of Witness at the Border, an organisation that logs the flights. A plane being loaded with migrant children In the past few weeks, the authorities have moved about 3,000 children out of the Border Patrol facility in Donna, transporting many to a new network of child detention centres around the country run by HHS, including the one Cindy was transferred to in San Diego. There are at least 13 such facilities, known as Emergency Intake Sites, on military bases, convention centres, or arenas in major US cities. These are a new part of a network of 200 detention centres for migrant children spread across 22 states. This means that Donna is far less crowded now, with the camp holding around 300 children. The facility is being expanded, as the influx of migrants across the border continues. One of the new Emergency Intake Sites is the Kay Bailey Hutchinson conference centre in central Dallas, which has 2,270 camp beds set up in a grid system in a huge hall, and held hundreds of teenage boys, aged 13-to-17, at its peak. Staff who work in the Dallas site say they have had to sign non-disclosure agreements specifying they are not to talk about what goes on inside. But some agreed to talk to us on condition of anonymity. ""The children always complain about not having enough, not eating enough,"" one staff member said. He also said the convention hall was cold, the boys had one thin blanket each, and were made to stay by their camp beds almost all day. ""Boys have been in there for 45 days straight with no sunlight, no recreation outside, no fresh air, no nothing,"" said the staff member. The moment Ariany reunited with her mother and brother He said that the boys were only given 30 minutes of recreation twice a week in an indoor room and many had been in the convention centre for weeks. ""They are all depressed. I heard the other day that several were contemplating suicide because of the conditions here. ""They are being treated like prisoners, like inmates,"" he said. ""It's haunting that this centre has not been able to meet the minimal standards of caring for unaccompanied minors."" In response to the allegations of neglect of migrant children in the new detention sites, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) said: ""The children are provided a safe and healthy environment with access to nutritious food, clean clothes, comfortable beds, education, recreational activities, and medical services."" ""The Dallas EIS (Emergency Intake Site) is providing required standards of care,"" the statement said. ""The entire administration is working together to reduce the length of time children are in federal custody by making unifications our top priority,"" it added, pointing out that the number of children in the care of the HHS has more than doubled. Children are being released regularly, but for many it is a very slow process. The average time in detention in the emergency centres is a month. The largest Emergency Intake Site is a tented facility at the Fort Bliss military base in El Paso, Texas, holding more than 4,500 children in the searing desert. It has a capacity for more than 10,000. A source inside has told the BBC that some of the tents contain 500-800 girls and boys who sleep in long rows of bunks. The source said hundreds of children are in Covid isolation, and that there are designated tents at the site now for scabies and lice, of which there are also outbreaks. Sources say the living conditions are unsanitary, and that there has been at least one report of sexual abuse in the girls' tent. An official document indicates children under six may be sent to Fort Bliss. The HHS did not respond to a BBC request for comment on these allegations. Amy Cohen, a psychiatrist based on the other side of the country in Los Angeles, has more than 30 years of experience working with traumatised children. She said the alleged conditions in the camps could be extremely damaging for those inside. ""Even after weeks in these conditions, many children are at greater risk of developing major psychiatric illnesses later in life, at greater risk of substance abuse and a greater risk of suicide,"" she said. Cohen said these migrant children would be even more vulnerable because many had been separated from a non-parental family member, or someone they came to rely on as a family member, at the border. ""If a child comes over with someone who is not their biological parent, even if they are their psychological parent, they are uniformly taken away from that individual, taken out of their laps, taken out of their arms, and called an unaccompanied minor."" She also said parents were being forced to make the decision to separate themselves from their children, because families who are turned away often then send their children back across the border alone, rather than risk their welfare in dangerous cities along the Mexican border. There, she says, they are vulnerable to rape, trafficking and assault. ""So these parents, when they find they're unable to protect their children, end up feeling forced to send their children by themselves across the river, in order to preserve their lives."" Cohen said that although children were no longer being physically taken from their biological parents by border guards - as had happened for a time under former President Trump's so-called ""zero tolerance policy"" - the process of family separation was deeply psychologically damaging. ""I interviewed children who were removed from parents under the Trump administration's 'zero tolerance' policyâ¦ and I've interviewed many children who've been now taken away from aunts, and uncles, and siblingsâ¦ I am seeing exactly the same trauma in these children now as we saw in those children then."" The CPB told the BBC that under federal law any child arriving without a parent or legal guardian was considered unaccompanied and must be transferred to the HHS without the adult relative. Has suspended the Migrant Protection Protocols programme, also known as the Remain in Mexico policy, which required migrants to wait in Mexico while their cases were being heard by US immigration courts. Has gradually admitted those already enrolled in the programme to wait in the US while their cases are heard, while stressing that the border remains closed for others. Has created a taskforce to reunite families who were divided during Trump's so-called ""zero tolerance"" policy Has paused construction on the Mexican border wall, and has proposed a major new immigration bill which would offer a pathway to citizenship for undocumented migrants already living in the US Read more here A pandemic health order,externalmeans that large numbers of adults and families are still being turned away at the border, and Mr Biden has urged migrants not to make the dangerous journey. But the Biden administration has allowed unaccompanied children under the age of 18 and, more recentlya small number of families with young children,,externalto enter the US while their claims are processed. In addition, it was announced last week that the US would also process250 asylum seekers a day,externalwho are deemed particularly vulnerable. Many children are travelling to meet family, spurred on by a widespread rumour that Mr Biden has taken massive strides to welcome immigrants, and reverse the immigration crackdown of his predecessor. Republican Beth Van Duyne, the congressional representative for Texas, said Mr Biden's policy of allowing children to cross the border alone was to blame for the crisis. ""[The administration] are absolutely incentivising the separation of families,"" she said. ""None of these centres are equipped to take care of children,"" added Van Duyne, who has visited at least two of the state's detention centres. But Democrat Congresswoman Sylvia R. Garcia, who has visited several sites, says the administration has taken significant strides to improve conditions for children. ""Yes there are [issues], but I'm telling you that based on what I'm seeing and ones I've visited the administration is doing much better than it did before when the surge started, because they were not prepared for the sheer numbers and they did not have the facilities in place, and they do now."" The core of the problem is that the number of migrant children arriving in the US, either with their families or alone, has been rising steadily over the past decade and the US does not have an efficient system in place to reunite migrant children with their US-based family members, critics say. ""Children arriving to the United States are being needlessly traumatised due to the long-standing failure of the US to build a modern border management system that recognises 21st Century migration trends,"" said Warren Binford, of the Willamette University College of Law. Ariany, the 10-year-old who was held in the Donna tents for weeks, later drew pictures while she was in another shelter, of love hearts and flowers. Sonia says her daughter has changed ""I made them because I was sad,"" she told us. She showed us the words she had written in Spanish by her drawing. ""It says, 'I love you, Mom. I love you all.'"" Ariany's mother says her daughter, once a bubbly, sociable girl, has changed since her time in detention. ""She's very quiet, she hardly speaks. She can't stand children near her right now."" ""The children we worry about most are the children who go quiet,"" said Amy Cohen, child trauma specialist. She says the danger, particularly for the youngest children, is that ""the trauma goes underground, it sits like land mines under the surface"". Now Ariany has nightmares. ""She's very afraid of going to sleep. She wakes up crying, screaming,"" said her mother Sonia. Paola said she cried when she came home at all times of night and day, and she also had difficulties sleeping. ""I don't think anyone in this countryâ¦ deserves to be treated like this,"" she said. ""Sometimes I pretended to be strong, because in this life you have to be strong. But this kind of thing leaves our hearts marked because even If we overcome it, we always remember.""

Many children are travelling to meet family, spurred on by a widespread rumour that Mr Biden has taken massive strides to welcome immigrants, and reverse the immigration crackdown of his predecessor. Republican Beth Van Duyne, the congressional representative for Texas, said Mr Biden's policy of allowing children to cross the border alone was to blame for the crisis. ""[The administration] are absolutely incentivising the separation of families,"" she said. ""None of these centres are equipped to take care of children,"" added Van Duyne, who has visited at least two of the state's detention centres. But Democrat Congresswoman Sylvia R. Garcia, who has visited several sites, says the administration has taken significant strides to improve conditions for children. ""Yes there are [issues], but I'm telling you that based on what I'm seeing and ones I've visited the administration is doing much better than it did before when the surge started, because they were not prepared for the sheer numbers and they did not have the facilities in place, and they do now."" The core of the problem is that the number of migrant children arriving in the US, either with their families or alone, has been rising steadily over the past decade and the US does not have an efficient system in place to reunite migrant children with their US-based family members, critics say. ""Children arriving to the United States are being needlessly traumatised due to the long-standing failure of the US to build a modern border management system that recognises 21st Century migration trends,"" said Warren Binford, of the Willamette University College of Law. Ariany, the 10-year-old who was held in the Donna tents for weeks, later drew pictures while she was in another shelter, of love hearts and flowers. Sonia says her daughter has changed ""I made them because I was sad,"" she told us. She showed us the words she had written in Spanish by her drawing. ""It says, 'I love you, Mom. I love you all.'"" Ariany's mother says her daughter, once a bubbly, sociable girl, has changed since her time in detention. ""She's very quiet, she hardly speaks. She can't stand children near her right now."" ""The children we worry about most are the children who go quiet,"" said Amy Cohen, child trauma specialist. She says the danger, particularly for the youngest children, is that ""the trauma goes underground, it sits like land mines under the surface"". Now Ariany has nightmares. ""She's very afraid of going to sleep. She wakes up crying, screaming,"" said her mother Sonia. Paola said she cried when she came home at all times of night and day, and she also had difficulties sleeping. ""I don't think anyone in this countryâ¦ deserves to be treated like this,"" she said. ""Sometimes I pretended to be strong, because in this life you have to be strong. But this kind of thing leaves our hearts marked because even If we overcome it, we always remember.""

"Ariany spent 22 days in detention The US has a vast system of detention sites scattered across the country, holding more than 20,000 migrant children. In a special investigation, the BBC has uncovered allegations of cold temperatures, sickness, neglect, lice and filth, through a series of interviews with children and staff. It was midnight on the Rio Grande - the imposing river that forms the border between Texas and Mexico - and lights began to flash on the Mexican side. Voices could be heard in the darkness. Figures emerged, got into a small raft, and began to cross the river. As the raft appeared on the US side, the faces of the migrants became visible. More than half of them were children. Over March and April,more than 36,000 children,externalcrossed into the US unaccompanied by an adult. This was a record high for recent years. Many children travelling alone set out on their journey hoping to reunite with a parent already in the US. More than 80% of themalready have a family member in the country,external, the US government says. President Joe Biden has opened the border to unaccompanied children seeking asylum, somewhat relaxing former President Trump's policy of turning migrants away due to Covid-19. The children scrambled up the banks, exhausted. Two young cousins held hands. Another youth, Jordy, 17, said he had fled Guatemala because he was afraid of violent gangs operating there. But tonight he was frightened about what might await him in migrant detention centres in the US. He said he had heard stories about them. ""They will put us in an icebox and ask us questions,"" he said. The so-called ""iceboxes"", notorious among migrants, are extremely cold rooms or cubicles in US Border Patrol migrant processing facilities. Jordy said he was escaping gang violence Jordy was told to join a line with other children. US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) guards were taking the children's shoelaces and belts, a process usually reserved for prisoners to prevent them trying to take their own lives. Jordy and the other children were then taken away by bus into the night. They were to join more than 20,000 migrant children now in US detention, held in a series of extensive camps around the country, at least 13 of which are new. In late March, CBP releaseddisturbing imagesof cramped conditions within one particular facility it runs in Donna, Texas - a mass of enormous white tents looming above the small town. The facility was designed to hold 250 people but housed more than 4,000 at peak occupancy. The Donna temporary facility pictured in late March People are seen separated by plastic sheeting in makeshift rooms Journalists have not been allowed to talk to the children inside. Instead we have been tracking down the children who have been released, to find out about conditions in US detention sites. Ten-year-old Ariany, who crossed into the US alone, spent 22 days in detention this spring, most of them in the Donna camp. She was crammed into a plastic cubicle - as were scores of other children, from toddlers to teens - wrapped in a silver emergency blanket. ""We were very cold,"" she said. ""We had nowhere to sleep so we shared mats. We were five girls on two mats."" Ariany was finally reunited with her mother, Sonia, in late March. She had passed her mother's contact details onto US officials who were able to locate her. Sonia had fled Honduras six years ago with her son due to gang violence, leaving Ariany - who was too young at the time to make the journey - behind with her older sister. Cindy, 16, also held in Donna this spring, said there were 80 girls in her cubicle and that she and most of the children were wet under their blankets, due to dripping pipes. ""We all woke up wet."" She said. ""We slept on our sides, all hugged, so we stayed warm."" Cindy was held in a cubicle with 80 other girls A number of children, including Ariany and Paola, a 16-year-old also released from Donna, told the BBC that they were given food that had expired, or was rotten or not cooked properly. They told us that many children became sick. ""Some girls fainted,"" said Jennifer, who was 17 at the time of her detention. Some girls in Donna were able to shower once a week, but others said they did not shower for several weeks at a time. Paola struggled with the filth. ""I started to feel my head itching, and I realised that it was not normal. They checked my head and told me that I had lice."" This video can not be played âI didn't see the light of day.â Hear from children held inside US detention camps. With children eating and sleeping in close quarters, the cubicles quickly became rancid. Ten-year-old Ariany said the guards threatened the children if they did not keep their cramped quarters clean. ""Sometimes they would tell us that if we were doing a lot of mess, they were going to punish us by leaving us there more days,"" she said. At night, the children said, the tents were filled with the sounds of crying. ""We all cried, from the youngest up. There were two-year-old, or one-and-a-half-year-old babies, crying because they wanted their mother,"" said Cindy. Paola said she tried to help the younger ones, but was also worried that she herself would never be reunited with her mother. Paola, 16, said she tried to comfort others ""They cried in front of me, and I just tried to comfort them and tell them that one day we would get out of there - although sometimes inside me I had doubt, because [the staff] would not ask me for my mom's number, her address, and I felt bad too,"" she said. And then one day Cindy began to deteriorate and feel ill. She tested positive for Covid-19, as have a startling number of migrant children in detention. Health and Human Services (HHS) reports more than 3,000 coronavirus cases among migrant children in Texas alone since last year. It is not known what the total number of cases is in the new emergency detention sites around the country. Eventually Cindy, without being told where she was going, was transferred with 40 other Covid positive children onto bus, then plane, and flown 2,400km (1,500 miles) away to San Diego, California. They were taken to a new detention site - a convention centre with the capacity for almost 1,500 children - with row after row of flimsy camp beds. She says she was kept away from the healthy children, in a section full of children with Covid. She said conditions were better than at Donna, but it was still days before she was able to shower. Persecution, gang violence and organised crime, losses from natural disasters (including two Central American hurricanes in 2020), and poverty are all causing parents to send their children to seek refuge in the US. Migrants are vulnerable to exploitation and sexual abuse along the way Most areteenagers from Guatemala, Honduras or El Salvador,external, though some are reported to be as young assix or seven,external They are either sent by relatives on their own,or with people smugglers,externalwho charge thousands of dollars, though reports suggest some families accompany the children to the border and then send them across alone to improve their chances of US entry Most have family members already in the US, about half of whom are a parent Only 4.3% of unaccompanied minors seeking asylumhave been deported since 2014,external Every day, flights leave US border towns loaded with children. ""On some days we estimate that hundreds of children are being transported around the country on these flights,"" said Thomas Cartwright, of Witness at the Border, an organisation that logs the flights. A plane being loaded with migrant children In the past few weeks, the authorities have moved about 3,000 children out of the Border Patrol facility in Donna, transporting many to a new network of child detention centres around the country run by HHS, including the one Cindy was transferred to in San Diego. There are at least 13 such facilities, known as Emergency Intake Sites, on military bases, convention centres, or arenas in major US cities. These are a new part of a network of 200 detention centres for migrant children spread across 22 states. This means that Donna is far less crowded now, with the camp holding around 300 children. The facility is being expanded, as the influx of migrants across the border continues. One of the new Emergency Intake Sites is the Kay Bailey Hutchinson conference centre in central Dallas, which has 2,270 camp beds set up in a grid system in a huge hall, and held hundreds of teenage boys, aged 13-to-17, at its peak. Staff who work in the Dallas site say they have had to sign non-disclosure agreements specifying they are not to talk about what goes on inside. But some agreed to talk to us on condition of anonymity. ""The children always complain about not having enough, not eating enough,"" one staff member said. He also said the convention hall was cold, the boys had one thin blanket each, and were made to stay by their camp beds almost all day. ""Boys have been in there for 45 days straight with no sunlight, no recreation outside, no fresh air, no nothing,"" said the staff member. The moment Ariany reunited with her mother and brother He said that the boys were only given 30 minutes of recreation twice a week in an indoor room and many had been in the convention centre for weeks. ""They are all depressed. I heard the other day that several were contemplating suicide because of the conditions here. ""They are being treated like prisoners, like inmates,"" he said. ""It's haunting that this centre has not been able to meet the minimal standards of caring for unaccompanied minors."" In response to the allegations of neglect of migrant children in the new detention sites, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) said: ""The children are provided a safe and healthy environment with access to nutritious food, clean clothes, comfortable beds, education, recreational activities, and medical services."" ""The Dallas EIS (Emergency Intake Site) is providing required standards of care,"" the statement said. ""The entire administration is working together to reduce the length of time children are in federal custody by making unifications our top priority,"" it added, pointing out that the number of children in the care of the HHS has more than doubled. Children are being released regularly, but for many it is a very slow process. The average time in detention in the emergency centres is a month. The largest Emergency Intake Site is a tented facility at the Fort Bliss military base in El Paso, Texas, holding more than 4,500 children in the searing desert. It has a capacity for more than 10,000. A source inside has told the BBC that some of the tents contain 500-800 girls and boys who sleep in long rows of bunks. The source said hundreds of children are in Covid isolation, and that there are designated tents at the site now for scabies and lice, of which there are also outbreaks. Sources say the living conditions are unsanitary, and that there has been at least one report of sexual abuse in the girls' tent. An official document indicates children under six may be sent to Fort Bliss. The HHS did not respond to a BBC request for comment on these allegations. Amy Cohen, a psychiatrist based on the other side of the country in Los Angeles, has more than 30 years of experience working with traumatised children. She said the alleged conditions in the camps could be extremely damaging for those inside. ""Even after weeks in these conditions, many children are at greater risk of developing major psychiatric illnesses later in life, at greater risk of substance abuse and a greater risk of suicide,"" she said. Cohen said these migrant children would be even more vulnerable because many had been separated from a non-parental family member, or someone they came to rely on as a family member, at the border. ""If a child comes over with someone who is not their biological parent, even if they are their psychological parent, they are uniformly taken away from that individual, taken out of their laps, taken out of their arms, and called an unaccompanied minor."" She also said parents were being forced to make the decision to separate themselves from their children, because families who are turned away often then send their children back across the border alone, rather than risk their welfare in dangerous cities along the Mexican border. There, she says, they are vulnerable to rape, trafficking and assault. ""So these parents, when they find they're unable to protect their children, end up feeling forced to send their children by themselves across the river, in order to preserve their lives."" Cohen said that although children were no longer being physically taken from their biological parents by border guards - as had happened for a time under former President Trump's so-called ""zero tolerance policy"" - the process of family separation was deeply psychologically damaging. ""I interviewed children who were removed from parents under the Trump administration's 'zero tolerance' policyâ¦ and I've interviewed many children who've been now taken away from aunts, and uncles, and siblingsâ¦ I am seeing exactly the same trauma in these children now as we saw in those children then."" The CPB told the BBC that under federal law any child arriving without a parent or legal guardian was considered unaccompanied and must be transferred to the HHS without the adult relative. Has suspended the Migrant Protection Protocols programme, also known as the Remain in Mexico policy, which required migrants to wait in Mexico while their cases were being heard by US immigration courts. Has gradually admitted those already enrolled in the programme to wait in the US while their cases are heard, while stressing that the border remains closed for others. Has created a taskforce to reunite families who were divided during Trump's so-called ""zero tolerance"" policy Has paused construction on the Mexican border wall, and has proposed a major new immigration bill which would offer a pathway to citizenship for undocumented migrants already living in the US Read more here A pandemic health order,externalmeans that large numbers of adults and families are still being turned away at the border, and Mr Biden has urged migrants not to make the dangerous journey.

"The raid happened days after Arundel Castle reopened on Tuesday A set of gold rosary beads carried by Mary Queen of Scots at her execution in 1587 was among items worth more than Â£1m stolen in a raid on Arundel Castle. The gold and silver artefacts were snatched from the West Sussex castle on Friday night. Other pieces taken during the raid include coronation cups given by Mary to the Earl Marshal. An Arundel Castle spokesman said the stolen items were of ""priceless historical importance"". The castle only reopened to the public on Tuesday. Staff were alerted to the break-in at 22:30 BST on Friday after a burglar alarm went off. Sussex Police told the BBC the thieves entered through a window and smashed a glass cabinet to grab the items. Det Con Molly O'Malley said the force thinks a 4x4 saloon found abandoned and on fire in nearby Barlavington ""was linked"" to the raid. The castle spokesman said the rosary had ""little intrinsic value as metal"" but was ""irreplaceable"". The rosary beads were carried by Mary as she was led to her death A spokesman for Arundel Castle Trustees said: ""The stolen items have significant monetary value, but as unique artefacts of the Duke of Norfolk's collection have immeasurably greater and priceless historical importance. ""We therefore urge anyone with information to come forward to the police to assist them in returning these treasures back where they belong."" Peter Squires, professor of criminology at the University of Brighton, said there was a ""surprising amount"" of thefts of ""antiquities or cultural artefacts"". He said items were often stolen to order and end up in the private collections of very rich people. He told BBC Radio Sussex: ""In war zones in the Middle East, there is a lot of evidence of museums being looted and the stolen items quickly finding themselves on to the dark web where they are bid on by dealers. ""Gold of course may just be melted down, which massively reduces its value, so to find someone who wants the items rather than just the bullion value is the thieves' objective here."" The items were taken from a display cabinet, police say Professor Kate Williams of Reading University said: ""When [Mary] fled Scotland into England most of her belongings were despoiled and shared out. ""Then after she was executed, nearly everything she had was taken and burned because people were concerned she would turn into a Catholic martyr. ""So we had one tiny memorial of Mary Queen of Scots - and now it has gone."" Det Con O'Malley urged people who were in Arundel on Friday evening and saw any suspicious activity around the area of the castle to contact the force either online or by calling 101, quoting Operation Deuce. ""The castle only re-opened to visitors on Tuesday 18 May, so if you were visiting during the past few days do you on reflection recall anyone behaving at all suspiciously?"" he said. Mary Queen of Scots was held in captivity for 18 years before she was executed Mary was born at Linlithgow Palace in 1542 and became queen when her father died soon after her birth However, Mary was taken to France in 1548 and Scotland was ruled by regents She returned in 1561 to begin her reign as Queen of Scots but was forced to abdicate at the age of 24 after six tumultuous years After an unsuccessful attempt to regain the throne, Mary fled to England seeking the protection of her cousin, Elizabeth I Mary had once claimed Elizabeth's throne as her own and was considered the legitimate sovereign by many English Catholics The Scots queen was held in captivity for 18 years before she was executed at Fotheringhay Castle in 1587, at the age of 44 Her son James became king of Scotland and England Mary, Queen of Scots film 'problematic' Mary Queen of Scots documents found Fierce winds threaten more fire destruction as LA struggles to contain blazes Powerful images of loss and heroism from LA UK has enough gas says No 10 after storage warning What's the latest on the Los Angeles wildfires and what caused them?

Migrants are vulnerable to exploitation and sexual abuse along the way Most areteenagers from Guatemala, Honduras or El Salvador,external, though some are reported to be as young assix or seven,external They are either sent by relatives on their own,or with people smugglers,externalwho charge thousands of dollars, though reports suggest some families accompany the children to the border and then send them across alone to improve their chances of US entry Most have family members already in the US, about half of whom are a parent Only 4.3% of unaccompanied minors seeking asylumhave been deported since 2014,external Every day, flights leave US border towns loaded with children. ""On some days we estimate that hundreds of children are being transported around the country on these flights,"" said Thomas Cartwright, of Witness at the Border, an organisation that logs the flights. A plane being loaded with migrant children In the past few weeks, the authorities have moved about 3,000 children out of the Border Patrol facility in Donna, transporting many to a new network of child detention centres around the country run by HHS, including the one Cindy was transferred to in San Diego. There are at least 13 such facilities, known as Emergency Intake Sites, on military bases, convention centres, or arenas in major US cities. These are a new part of a network of 200 detention centres for migrant children spread across 22 states. This means that Donna is far less crowded now, with the camp holding around 300 children. The facility is being expanded, as the influx of migrants across the border continues. One of the new Emergency Intake Sites is the Kay Bailey Hutchinson conference centre in central Dallas, which has 2,270 camp beds set up in a grid system in a huge hall, and held hundreds of teenage boys, aged 13-to-17, at its peak. Staff who work in the Dallas site say they have had to sign non-disclosure agreements specifying they are not to talk about what goes on inside. But some agreed to talk to us on condition of anonymity. ""The children always complain about not having enough, not eating enough,"" one staff member said. He also said the convention hall was cold, the boys had one thin blanket each, and were made to stay by their camp beds almost all day. ""Boys have been in there for 45 days straight with no sunlight, no recreation outside, no fresh air, no nothing,"" said the staff member. The moment Ariany reunited with her mother and brother He said that the boys were only given 30 minutes of recreation twice a week in an indoor room and many had been in the convention centre for weeks. ""They are all depressed. I heard the other day that several were contemplating suicide because of the conditions here. ""They are being treated like prisoners, like inmates,"" he said. ""It's haunting that this centre has not been able to meet the minimal standards of caring for unaccompanied minors."" In response to the allegations of neglect of migrant children in the new detention sites, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) said: ""The children are provided a safe and healthy environment with access to nutritious food, clean clothes, comfortable beds, education, recreational activities, and medical services."" ""The Dallas EIS (Emergency Intake Site) is providing required standards of care,"" the statement said. ""The entire administration is working together to reduce the length of time children are in federal custody by making unifications our top priority,"" it added, pointing out that the number of children in the care of the HHS has more than doubled. Children are being released regularly, but for many it is a very slow process. The average time in detention in the emergency centres is a month. The largest Emergency Intake Site is a tented facility at the Fort Bliss military base in El Paso, Texas, holding more than 4,500 children in the searing desert. It has a capacity for more than 10,000. A source inside has told the BBC that some of the tents contain 500-800 girls and boys who sleep in long rows of bunks. The source said hundreds of children are in Covid isolation, and that there are designated tents at the site now for scabies and lice, of which there are also outbreaks. Sources say the living conditions are unsanitary, and that there has been at least one report of sexual abuse in the girls' tent. An official document indicates children under six may be sent to Fort Bliss. The HHS did not respond to a BBC request for comment on these allegations. Amy Cohen, a psychiatrist based on the other side of the country in Los Angeles, has more than 30 years of experience working with traumatised children. She said the alleged conditions in the camps could be extremely damaging for those inside. ""Even after weeks in these conditions, many children are at greater risk of developing major psychiatric illnesses later in life, at greater risk of substance abuse and a greater risk of suicide,"" she said. Cohen said these migrant children would be even more vulnerable because many had been separated from a non-parental family member, or someone they came to rely on as a family member, at the border. ""If a child comes over with someone who is not their biological parent, even if they are their psychological parent, they are uniformly taken away from that individual, taken out of their laps, taken out of their arms, and called an unaccompanied minor."" She also said parents were being forced to make the decision to separate themselves from their children, because families who are turned away often then send their children back across the border alone, rather than risk their welfare in dangerous cities along the Mexican border. There, she says, they are vulnerable to rape, trafficking and assault. ""So these parents, when they find they're unable to protect their children, end up feeling forced to send their children by themselves across the river, in order to preserve their lives."" Cohen said that although children were no longer being physically taken from their biological parents by border guards - as had happened for a time under former President Trump's so-called ""zero tolerance policy"" - the process of family separation was deeply psychologically damaging. ""I interviewed children who were removed from parents under the Trump administration's 'zero tolerance' policyâ¦ and I've interviewed many children who've been now taken away from aunts, and uncles, and siblingsâ¦ I am seeing exactly the same trauma in these children now as we saw in those children then."" The CPB told the BBC that under federal law any child arriving without a parent or legal guardian was considered unaccompanied and must be transferred to the HHS without the adult relative. Has suspended the Migrant Protection Protocols programme, also known as the Remain in Mexico policy, which required migrants to wait in Mexico while their cases were being heard by US immigration courts. Has gradually admitted those already enrolled in the programme to wait in the US while their cases are heard, while stressing that the border remains closed for others. Has created a taskforce to reunite families who were divided during Trump's so-called ""zero tolerance"" policy Has paused construction on the Mexican border wall, and has proposed a major new immigration bill which would offer a pathway to citizenship for undocumented migrants already living in the US Read more here A pandemic health order,externalmeans that large numbers of adults and families are still being turned away at the border, and Mr Biden has urged migrants not to make the dangerous journey. But the Biden administration has allowed unaccompanied children under the age of 18 and, more recentlya small number of families with young children,,externalto enter the US while their claims are processed. In addition, it was announced last week that the US would also process250 asylum seekers a day,externalwho are deemed particularly vulnerable. Many children are travelling to meet family, spurred on by a widespread rumour that Mr Biden has taken massive strides to welcome immigrants, and reverse the immigration crackdown of his predecessor. Republican Beth Van Duyne, the congressional representative for Texas, said Mr Biden's policy of allowing children to cross the border alone was to blame for the crisis. ""[The administration] are absolutely incentivising the separation of families,"" she said. ""None of these centres are equipped to take care of children,"" added Van Duyne, who has visited at least two of the state's detention centres. But Democrat Congresswoman Sylvia R. Garcia, who has visited several sites, says the administration has taken significant strides to improve conditions for children. ""Yes there are [issues], but I'm telling you that based on what I'm seeing and ones I've visited the administration is doing much better than it did before when the surge started, because they were not prepared for the sheer numbers and they did not have the facilities in place, and they do now."" The core of the problem is that the number of migrant children arriving in the US, either with their families or alone, has been rising steadily over the past decade and the US does not have an efficient system in place to reunite migrant children with their US-based family members, critics say. ""Children arriving to the United States are being needlessly traumatised due to the long-standing failure of the US to build a modern border management system that recognises 21st Century migration trends,"" said Warren Binford, of the Willamette University College of Law. Ariany, the 10-year-old who was held in the Donna tents for weeks, later drew pictures while she was in another shelter, of love hearts and flowers. Sonia says her daughter has changed ""I made them because I was sad,"" she told us. She showed us the words she had written in Spanish by her drawing. ""It says, 'I love you, Mom. I love you all.'"" Ariany's mother says her daughter, once a bubbly, sociable girl, has changed since her time in detention. ""She's very quiet, she hardly speaks. She can't stand children near her right now."" ""The children we worry about most are the children who go quiet,"" said Amy Cohen, child trauma specialist. She says the danger, particularly for the youngest children, is that ""the trauma goes underground, it sits like land mines under the surface"". Now Ariany has nightmares. ""She's very afraid of going to sleep. She wakes up crying, screaming,"" said her mother Sonia. Paola said she cried when she came home at all times of night and day, and she also had difficulties sleeping. ""I don't think anyone in this countryâ¦ deserves to be treated like this,"" she said. ""Sometimes I pretended to be strong, because in this life you have to be strong. But this kind of thing leaves our hearts marked because even If we overcome it, we always remember.""

"The World Health Organization's head says all health workers and elderly worldwide would be vaccinated by now if jabs were shared fairly Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus says governments vaccinating low risk groups do so at the expense of vulnerable people elsewhere He says the world should do a ""massive push to vaccinate at least 10% of the population of every country by September"" British tourists can now enter Spain without any restrictions, but UK rules mean they must still take tests and quarantine when they're back ""We are not trying to rush into this... we have learnt from the pandemic,"" says Spain's tourism minister Fernando ValdÃ©s Statistics show overseas visitors to the UK fell by about three-quarters in 2020 - as did overseas travel by UK residents The number of coronavirus deaths in India passes 300,000, although experts say the number could be much higher Lockdown rules are easing in Northern Ireland - with indoor socialising in groups of up to six allowed and pubs reopening inside More than 250 pupils are isolating after 26 positive cases were confirmed at a school in Porthcawl, south Wales Edited by James Clarke And that's it from us today. This coverage has been brought to you by Francesca Gillett, Doug Faulkner, Jennifer Meierhans, Rob Corp and James Clarke. Thanks for joining us and we will be back again tomorrow to bring you the latest coronavirus news from across the world. A medical worker injects a man with a dose of the Covid-19 vaccine at a hospital in Accra, capital of Ghana as part of the Covax scheme We're about to bring our coverage to a close but here is a little reminder of some of today's headlines from around the world:   A secondary school in Middlesbrough is closing for the rest of the week following a number of positive Covid cases. Students at The King's Academy in Coulby Newham will continue their learning online after Middlesbrough Council closed the school after Covid infections were found in all year groups. A mobile testing unit will soon be set up in the grounds with all students and staff encouraged to have a PCR test. Principal David Dawes says: ""We've acted quickly in response to a small number of cases. We will always put the safety of the wider community first."" Clackmannanshire has overtaken Glasgow City as having the highest Covid rate in Scotland. New figures show the region had a seven-day average rate of 139.7 cases per 100,000 people compared to Glasgow City's 136.8. The equivalent case rate for the whole of the UK is 23 per 100,000 people Glasgow is the only part of Scotland under level three Covid restrictions. Health Secretary Humza Yousaf says: ""Clackmannanshire has a really small population, so even four, five, six households testing positive can really make the numbers look like they're shooting up. But it is a concerning situation."" Residents have been encouraged to take a Covid test and extra test facilities have been set up. You can read morehere. Here are the latest graphs showing the progress of the pandemic in the UK. As you can see deaths from Covid-19 remain at low levels while the number of cases is leveling off. There is no ""plan B"" for fans inside Hampden at Euro 2020 if Glasgow remains in Scottish government level three restrictions, says the Scottish Football Association. Doubts exist over whether supporters will still be allowed in for the four matches at Scotland's national stadium. A minimum crowd of 12,000 has been agreed with Uefa for those games, butno fans were allowed to attend Saturday's Scottish Cup final. ""The games will be at Hampden,"" says SFA chief executive Ian Maxwell. ""There can't be any plan B in terms of spectators because of ticket sales and stadium processes and all of those things, but hopefully we don't need to get to that point."" Maxwell says the SFA is in daily contact with the Scottish government about the Covid-19 situation in Glasgow. The local authority area is currentlythe only one in Scotland in level three,meaning large crowds are prohibited in the city. Northern Ireland is the latest UK nation to update its rules on weddings. From today, there is no government limit on the number of people allowed at wedding ceremonies in NI. But that doesn't mean you can have unlimited numbers - instead, the limit depends on how many people each venue can safely accommodate. Face masks must also be worn by guests in the ceremony, and while receptions can go ahead, there are some rules. Tables must be no bigger than 10 guests (except for the top table), the wedding couple can only have one dance and live music is not allowed. The rules in England and Wales currently limit the total number of people to 30, while in Scotland the limit is 50 providing people can socially distance. For more information on the latest rules, head here. Chris JeavansBBC News Bolton, Blackburn and
Bedford accounted for almost 900 cases of the variant first identified in
India, in the latest week of available data. Genomic analysis by theSanger Institute,externalfor the week of 9-15 May, found a total of 1,900 cases of
the B.1.617.2 variant across England. Of these, 611 were in
Bolton, 145 in Blackburn with Darwen and 126 in Bedford. All regions of England saw
some cases of the variant, with numbers and rates generally highest in the
North West - as seen on this map. Sequencing positive
coronavirus test results to find out which variant they contain takes several
days so there is always a lag in the data. However, this picture is
broadly similar to the findings Public Health England put out at the
weekend. PHE also found almost
half of all the coronavirus cases it had sequenced in the most recent week were
B.1.617.2 and that prevalence of the variant had risen rapidly. Marilyn Muldoon is looking forward to being reunited with cat Queenie who has a pet passport A British couple who rent a house in Spain say they will attempt to drive over to collect their belongings and their cat now that Spain has opened its borders to UK travellers. Marilyn Muldoon from Westwoodside, North
Lincolnshire, says she and her husband had rented a house in Pruna, between Malaga and Seville, for a year last July. They returned home for Christmas but were not able to get back after the UK went into another lockdown and international travel was banned. With their tenancy up in July, they want to go back and collect their things and cat Queenie who is being looked after by a neighbour, but say they are confused by travel advice. Marilyn says: ""We've no idea what news to believe or even how to go about
trying to find the right information. Itâs been the waiting. Even when people
tell you on the news, itâs still confusing. Spain is on the amber list, so you
can go but youâre not meant to."" She says they will set off in the next week by ferry to Santander and have ""no objections"" to quarantining when they get back. A further three deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test have been reported across the UK. There were also a further 2,439 positive cases identified,according to the latest figures,external. An additional 126,357 people received their first dose of a vaccination, while 252,139 received a second jab. This video can not be played Members of the amateur choir say the rules need changing so they can perform indoors. Members of an amateur choir in North Yorkshire are among a chorus of voices across the country calling for a change in Covid restrictions to allow them to perform. Current Covid guidelines state choirs can only perform or rehearse indoors in groups of no more than six. Craig Ratcliffe, musical director of Tadcaster Community Choir, says: ""There's not been consideration for the differences that choirs can have"". Meanwhile, the chair of the choir, Celia Oldroyd, says not being able to perform is ""depressing"". The Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport says it understands it is ""disappointing"" but ""we are taking decisions based on the advice of our public health experts"". There are reports in India that a couple chartered a plane to hold a mid-air wedding with more than 160 guests in an effort to escape Covid restrictions. Video footage posted on social media appearsto show the couple and their guests packed into a hired jet. The state of Tamil Nadu, where the flight is said to have originated, recently imposed tougher restrictions, limiting weddings to 50 guests. India's aviation authority has launched an investigation, reports say. An official from the Directorate General of Civil Aviation tells the Times of India the SpiceJet staff aboard the flight had been taken off duty. A SpiceJet spokesperson tells the Indian Express the Boeing 737 was booked from Madurai to Bangalore by a travel agent for a trip after a wedding. The spokesperson says the client was ""clearly briefed on Covid guidelines to be followed and denied permission for any activity to be performed on board"".

It features 33 blossom trees to represent the 32 London Boroughs and the City of London. To mark the opening Sadiq Khan is announcing the launch of a bereavement support programme that will direct people to advice and support and that will begin with a public awareness campaign. He says the garden will be a lasting living memorial to the more than 19,000 Londoners who have died during the pandemic.

""Nothing will make losing someone you love any easier, but we want Londoners to know they are not alone. We are here for you, as a city."" More than 250 pupils are isolating after 26 people tested positive for coronavirus at a Welsh school. In total 267 out of about 400 pupils have been sent home from West Park Primary, in Porthcawl, south Wales. Bridgend Council says parents have ""been advised to remain alert"" and online learning is being arranged. A spokesman says four staff and 22 pupils had tested positive. They say ""all staff and most pupils"" in year one were affected. There were also cases among pupils ""in nursery, reception, year two and year threeâ³, theLocal Democracy Reporting Servicesays. The council says 68 brothers and sisters of the pupils sent home have also been told to isolate, meaning a total of 335 people are home learning. More than 1.5 billion doses of coronavirus vaccines have been administered, in at least 189 countries worldwide. However, there are vast differences in the pace of progress in different parts of the world. The UK, for example, is on the brink of vaccinating its under-30s, while some countries are still waiting for their first shipments. Earlier, the head of the World Health Organization said the unequal distribution of vaccines was ""scandalous"". Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the gap was making the global pandemic worse - and that 75% of all doses have gone to just 10 countries. Many poorer countries are relying on deliveries from Covax. Dr Tedros has told rich countries to start donating some of their doses now - rather than waiting for surplus - and asked pharmaceutical companies to give the WHO first refusal on all new batches of vaccine. The aim is to vaccinate 10% of every countryâs population by September, he says. Read more about vaccination worldwide here. People ""should be worried"" about a resurgence in Covid, the Welsh government's chief medical officer says. Dr Frank Atherton says a spike in the Indian variant to ""around 57"" cases from 28 last Thursday is ""something we need to watch very carefully"". He says most of these cases were in Cardiff and the Vale of Glamorgan, although they have been identified in all health board areas apart from Powys. He says measures such as social distancing and using face coverings were ""the things that keep us safe"" and there was a risk the situation could ""go into reverse"" if those measures were relaxed. ""The public should be worried about the resurgence in coronavirus in general really,"" he says. ""We have a small number of cases - 57 at the moment of the so-called Indian variant - but that will be an underestimate and I expect the numbers to rise."" Read more. About half the people who were due to get a Covid jab at a mass vaccination centre in Glasgow failed to turn up over the weekend. The BBC has learned a ""considerable"" number of no shows were recorded on both Saturday and Sunday at the Hydro. The venue can administer a minimum of 4,000 vaccinations each day, with a capacity to scale up to 10,000. Glasgow has the highest coronavirus rates in the country at 133 cases per 100,000 people in the seven days to 20 May. It is the only council area in Scotland under level three Covid restrictions and people aged 18 to 39 in certain postcode areas are being offered jabs early to tackle surging cases.

"This video can not be played DR Congo's Goma volcano: Drone images show devastation Ernestine Kabuo returned home after fleeing the lava flow in Goma, Democratic Republic of Congo, to find that her husband had not survived. The 68 year old was unable to carry her sick husband out of their house and she found him burnt to death, she told Reuters news agency. At least 22 deaths have been confirmed following Saturday's eruption of a nearby volcano, Mount Nyiragongo. But the lava stopped short of the city's built-up area. This avoided the level of death and destruction witnessed in 2002. It did, however, hit the Buhene district, where Ms Kabuo's home was. Africa Live: Latest updates from the continent In pictures: Mount Nyiragongo erupts Watch: 'I monitor Congo's deadliest volcano' ""I said to myself: I can't go alone, we've been married for the best and for the worst,"" she told Reuters reflecting on what happened on Saturday. Ernestine Kabuo was unable to save her husband ""I went back to at least try to get him out but couldn't. I ran away and he got burned inside. I don't know what to do. I curse this day."" Five people died of asphyxiation while trying to cross the lava when it was cooling in a place just north of Goma. A sixth person is in hospital with breathing difficulties, civil society leader Mambo Kawaya told the AFP news agency. Since then, the authorities have tried to prevent people from visiting places where the lava is cooling, Goma journalist Esdras Tsongo told the BBC's Focus on Africa radio programme. Other Goma residents, a city of 670,000 according to UN estimates, are searching for missing loved ones as the city, and the region, continues to experience earthquakes. More than 170 children are feared to be missing and 150 others had been separated from their families, the UN's children's agency, Unicef, said, adding that centres would be set up to help unaccompanied minors. Please refresh your browser Nine of the deaths so far recorded by the authorities occurred in a traffic accident as people fled. Four others died as they tried to escape a prison while two were burned to death, government spokesman Patrick Muyaya said on Sunday. But there are fears that more deaths may be confirmed as people return to the remains of their houses. The lava stopped in the Buhene district, on the outskirts of Goma, burying hundreds of houses and even large buildings. Reconstruction efforts are likely to take months. ""All the houses in Buhene neighbourhood were burned,"" Innocent Bahala Shamavu told the Associated Press news agency. Local people have been sifting through the remains of flattened houses Elsewhere, lava crossed the N2 road connecting Goma to the city of Beni, severing a key aid and supply route. However, the city's airport was untouched, despite earlier reports that it had been affected. The volcano, located 10km (six miles) from Goma, last erupted in 2002, killing 250 people and making 120,000 homeless. Residents started leaving their houses even before the government announced an evacuation plan. At night, crowds were seen fleeing on foot with mattresses and other belongings. Rwandan authorities said more than 3,000 people had officially crossed from Goma. Some started to return on Sunday. Others went to higher ground to the west of the city. One Goma resident, Richard Bahati, said he was in his house when he heard screaming and became extremely worried as he saw the sky reddening outside. ""I lived through the problem with this volcano in 2002. The volcano devastated all our homes and possessions,"" he said. A local trader, Kambere Ombeni, was among those who returned to the scene as the rubble still smouldered. ""We watched the whole neighbourhood in the Nyiragongo territory go up in smoke. The fire came right down to here. Even now we can still see lava,"" he said. Another resident, Irene Bauma, said people would need help from the government to rebuild their lives. ""There's land, people, a population that has lost everything, maybe there are also deaths, who knows? We are asking the government to come and help the survivors of this eruption."" Tom Peyre-Costa, from the Norwegian Refugee Council in Goma, told the BBC what had happened. ""The lava was pretty slow, like, 1km/h, but it didn't stop.... It started burning the houses,"" he said, adding that humanitarian organisations were already trying to address people's needs. This image captured on Saturday shows how the lava was destroying everything in its path Mount Nyiragongo is one of the world's more active volcanoes but there were concerns that its activity had not been properly observed by the Goma Volcano Observatory, since the World Bank cut funding amid allegations of corruption. Professor Mike Burton, a volcanologist at the University of Manchester in England, told the BBC that the lava in Mount Nyiragongo is particularly fluid and has the potential to move fast. In a report on 10 May, the observatory warned that seismic activity at Nyiragongo had increased. Last year, the observatory's director,Katcho Karume, told the BBC World Service's Science in Action that the volcano's lava lake had been filling up quickly,increasing the chances of an eruption in the next few years. But he also warned that an earthquake could trigger a disaster earlier. The volcano's deadliest eruption happened in 1977, when more than 600 people died.

"The UK's energy regulator has approved plans to invest Â£300m in low carbon projects including support for 3,550 charging points for electric vehicles. Ofgem said the funds would allow energy networks to build robust electricity infrastructure for installing charging points across UK motorways. It said while more people are buying electric cars, others are put off due to a lack of charging points near home. Ofgem said a wider charging network would help address ""range anxiety"". The new funding will support the infrastructure needed to support 1,800 new ultra-rapid charging points at motorway service areas. There are currently 918 ultra-rapid charge points in the UK which can add a range of 100 miles to an electric car in around 30 minutes. The investment will also allow an additional 1,750 rapid charging points to be installed. In addition to motorways, cities and train stations will also see increased network capacity to support more charging points. Car buyers still sceptical about electric - Ford Electric cars ditched over lack of chargers in NI In total, the UK has nearly 24,000 charging points, which have more than 41,000 connectors - or cables - that can be plugged into an electric car, according to electric vehicle app and website Zap-Map. ""As drivers make the switch from petrol and diesel to electric, Britain's cables, substations and other infrastructure need a massive upgrade to support this new demand for electricity,"" Ofgem said. When it comes to public charging points for electric cars, the UK isn't doing too badly. According to Zap-Map, there are nearly 24,000 chargers installed around the country. That's less than half the number available in the Netherlands, but not far short of what France and Germany have to offer. It's also more than double the number available in 2018. But with the sale of new petrol and diesel cars to be banned from 2030, more infrastructure is needed, and Ofgem has acknowledged that fact. Today's announcement is not a game changer, but rather a statement of intent. Some 1,800 ultra-fast chargers, capable of charging car batteries in minutes rather than hours, will be installed across the motorway network - as reassurance for electric vehicle drivers who want to embark on long journeys. The Â£300m investment is, relatively speaking, a drop in the ocean. But it forms part of a much bigger Â£40bn investment programme for the energy network as a whole approved last year. It's likely a much more significant portion of those funds will ultimately be allocated towards getting the country ready for electric vehicles. The investment, which will be made over two years, will also support the provision of more ""clean"", low carbon electric heating for homes and businesses. Sales of new cars powered solely by petrol or diesel will be banned in the UK from 2030. A recent report by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) found that while demand for electric vehicles is growing in the UK - accounting for one in 10 car registrations last year - it was mainly fuelled by businesses or buyers of fleets. ""Just 4.6% of new consumer vehicles were battery powered,"" it said. So far, the installation of charging points has mainly been concentrated in London and the South East. Ofgem said the investment by energy networks would support more ultra-rapid charge points in cities such as Glasgow, Kirkwall, Warrington, Llandudno, York and Truro. While the number of charging points in the UK is growing, it is still far short of the estimated 2.7 million the SMMT said the country would need by 2030, the vast majority of which need to be available for people who park their cars on a nearby street at home. ""Drivers need certainty that they can recharge their vehicle conveniently and on demand,"" it said. ""For many, that means using a charging point at home. ""However, at least one in three households rely on on-street parking as they have no driveway or garage and still more have no designated off-street parking."" The SMMT said that to accommodate these drivers ""there must be a commitment to expand on-street public charging in residential areas"".

"The World Health Organization's head says all health workers and elderly worldwide would be vaccinated by now if jabs were shared fairly Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus says governments vaccinating low risk groups do so at the expense of vulnerable people elsewhere He says the world should do a ""massive push to vaccinate at least 10% of the population of every country by September"" British tourists can now enter Spain without any restrictions, but UK rules mean they must still take tests and quarantine when they're back ""We are not trying to rush into this... we have learnt from the pandemic,"" says Spain's tourism minister Fernando ValdÃ©s Statistics show overseas visitors to the UK fell by about three-quarters in 2020 - as did overseas travel by UK residents The number of coronavirus deaths in India passes 300,000, although experts say the number could be much higher Lockdown rules are easing in Northern Ireland - with indoor socialising in groups of up to six allowed and pubs reopening inside More than 250 pupils are isolating after 26 positive cases were confirmed at a school in Porthcawl, south Wales Edited by James Clarke And that's it from us today. This coverage has been brought to you by Francesca Gillett, Doug Faulkner, Jennifer Meierhans, Rob Corp and James Clarke. Thanks for joining us and we will be back again tomorrow to bring you the latest coronavirus news from across the world. A medical worker injects a man with a dose of the Covid-19 vaccine at a hospital in Accra, capital of Ghana as part of the Covax scheme We're about to bring our coverage to a close but here is a little reminder of some of today's headlines from around the world:   A secondary school in Middlesbrough is closing for the rest of the week following a number of positive Covid cases. Students at The King's Academy in Coulby Newham will continue their learning online after Middlesbrough Council closed the school after Covid infections were found in all year groups. A mobile testing unit will soon be set up in the grounds with all students and staff encouraged to have a PCR test. Principal David Dawes says: ""We've acted quickly in response to a small number of cases. We will always put the safety of the wider community first."" Clackmannanshire has overtaken Glasgow City as having the highest Covid rate in Scotland. New figures show the region had a seven-day average rate of 139.7 cases per 100,000 people compared to Glasgow City's 136.8. The equivalent case rate for the whole of the UK is 23 per 100,000 people Glasgow is the only part of Scotland under level three Covid restrictions. Health Secretary Humza Yousaf says: ""Clackmannanshire has a really small population, so even four, five, six households testing positive can really make the numbers look like they're shooting up. But it is a concerning situation."" Residents have been encouraged to take a Covid test and extra test facilities have been set up. You can read morehere. Here are the latest graphs showing the progress of the pandemic in the UK. As you can see deaths from Covid-19 remain at low levels while the number of cases is leveling off. There is no ""plan B"" for fans inside Hampden at Euro 2020 if Glasgow remains in Scottish government level three restrictions, says the Scottish Football Association. Doubts exist over whether supporters will still be allowed in for the four matches at Scotland's national stadium. A minimum crowd of 12,000 has been agreed with Uefa for those games, butno fans were allowed to attend Saturday's Scottish Cup final. ""The games will be at Hampden,"" says SFA chief executive Ian Maxwell. ""There can't be any plan B in terms of spectators because of ticket sales and stadium processes and all of those things, but hopefully we don't need to get to that point."" Maxwell says the SFA is in daily contact with the Scottish government about the Covid-19 situation in Glasgow. The local authority area is currentlythe only one in Scotland in level three,meaning large crowds are prohibited in the city. Northern Ireland is the latest UK nation to update its rules on weddings. From today, there is no government limit on the number of people allowed at wedding ceremonies in NI. But that doesn't mean you can have unlimited numbers - instead, the limit depends on how many people each venue can safely accommodate. Face masks must also be worn by guests in the ceremony, and while receptions can go ahead, there are some rules. Tables must be no bigger than 10 guests (except for the top table), the wedding couple can only have one dance and live music is not allowed. The rules in England and Wales currently limit the total number of people to 30, while in Scotland the limit is 50 providing people can socially distance. For more information on the latest rules, head here. Chris JeavansBBC News Bolton, Blackburn and
Bedford accounted for almost 900 cases of the variant first identified in
India, in the latest week of available data. Genomic analysis by theSanger Institute,externalfor the week of 9-15 May, found a total of 1,900 cases of
the B.1.617.2 variant across England. Of these, 611 were in
Bolton, 145 in Blackburn with Darwen and 126 in Bedford. All regions of England saw
some cases of the variant, with numbers and rates generally highest in the
North West - as seen on this map. Sequencing positive
coronavirus test results to find out which variant they contain takes several
days so there is always a lag in the data. However, this picture is
broadly similar to the findings Public Health England put out at the
weekend. PHE also found almost
half of all the coronavirus cases it had sequenced in the most recent week were
B.1.617.2 and that prevalence of the variant had risen rapidly. Marilyn Muldoon is looking forward to being reunited with cat Queenie who has a pet passport A British couple who rent a house in Spain say they will attempt to drive over to collect their belongings and their cat now that Spain has opened its borders to UK travellers. Marilyn Muldoon from Westwoodside, North
Lincolnshire, says she and her husband had rented a house in Pruna, between Malaga and Seville, for a year last July. They returned home for Christmas but were not able to get back after the UK went into another lockdown and international travel was banned. With their tenancy up in July, they want to go back and collect their things and cat Queenie who is being looked after by a neighbour, but say they are confused by travel advice. Marilyn says: ""We've no idea what news to believe or even how to go about
trying to find the right information. Itâs been the waiting. Even when people
tell you on the news, itâs still confusing. Spain is on the amber list, so you
can go but youâre not meant to."" She says they will set off in the next week by ferry to Santander and have ""no objections"" to quarantining when they get back. A further three deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test have been reported across the UK. There were also a further 2,439 positive cases identified,according to the latest figures,external. An additional 126,357 people received their first dose of a vaccination, while 252,139 received a second jab. This video can not be played Members of the amateur choir say the rules need changing so they can perform indoors. Members of an amateur choir in North Yorkshire are among a chorus of voices across the country calling for a change in Covid restrictions to allow them to perform. Current Covid guidelines state choirs can only perform or rehearse indoors in groups of no more than six. Craig Ratcliffe, musical director of Tadcaster Community Choir, says: ""There's not been consideration for the differences that choirs can have"". Meanwhile, the chair of the choir, Celia Oldroyd, says not being able to perform is ""depressing"". The Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport says it understands it is ""disappointing"" but ""we are taking decisions based on the advice of our public health experts"". There are reports in India that a couple chartered a plane to hold a mid-air wedding with more than 160 guests in an effort to escape Covid restrictions. Video footage posted on social media appearsto show the couple and their guests packed into a hired jet. The state of Tamil Nadu, where the flight is said to have originated, recently imposed tougher restrictions, limiting weddings to 50 guests. India's aviation authority has launched an investigation, reports say. An official from the Directorate General of Civil Aviation tells the Times of India the SpiceJet staff aboard the flight had been taken off duty. A SpiceJet spokesperson tells the Indian Express the Boeing 737 was booked from Madurai to Bangalore by a travel agent for a trip after a wedding. The spokesperson says the client was ""clearly briefed on Covid guidelines to be followed and denied permission for any activity to be performed on board"".

It features 33 blossom trees to represent the 32 London Boroughs and the City of London. To mark the opening Sadiq Khan is announcing the launch of a bereavement support programme that will direct people to advice and support and that will begin with a public awareness campaign. He says the garden will be a lasting living memorial to the more than 19,000 Londoners who have died during the pandemic.

""Nothing will make losing someone you love any easier, but we want Londoners to know they are not alone. We are here for you, as a city."" More than 250 pupils are isolating after 26 people tested positive for coronavirus at a Welsh school. In total 267 out of about 400 pupils have been sent home from West Park Primary, in Porthcawl, south Wales. Bridgend Council says parents have ""been advised to remain alert"" and online learning is being arranged. A spokesman says four staff and 22 pupils had tested positive. They say ""all staff and most pupils"" in year one were affected. There were also cases among pupils ""in nursery, reception, year two and year threeâ³, theLocal Democracy Reporting Servicesays. The council says 68 brothers and sisters of the pupils sent home have also been told to isolate, meaning a total of 335 people are home learning. More than 1.5 billion doses of coronavirus vaccines have been administered, in at least 189 countries worldwide. However, there are vast differences in the pace of progress in different parts of the world. The UK, for example, is on the brink of vaccinating its under-30s, while some countries are still waiting for their first shipments. Earlier, the head of the World Health Organization said the unequal distribution of vaccines was ""scandalous"". Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the gap was making the global pandemic worse - and that 75% of all doses have gone to just 10 countries. Many poorer countries are relying on deliveries from Covax. Dr Tedros has told rich countries to start donating some of their doses now - rather than waiting for surplus - and asked pharmaceutical companies to give the WHO first refusal on all new batches of vaccine. The aim is to vaccinate 10% of every countryâs population by September, he says. Read more about vaccination worldwide here. People ""should be worried"" about a resurgence in Covid, the Welsh government's chief medical officer says. Dr Frank Atherton says a spike in the Indian variant to ""around 57"" cases from 28 last Thursday is ""something we need to watch very carefully"". He says most of these cases were in Cardiff and the Vale of Glamorgan, although they have been identified in all health board areas apart from Powys. He says measures such as social distancing and using face coverings were ""the things that keep us safe"" and there was a risk the situation could ""go into reverse"" if those measures were relaxed. ""The public should be worried about the resurgence in coronavirus in general really,"" he says. ""We have a small number of cases - 57 at the moment of the so-called Indian variant - but that will be an underestimate and I expect the numbers to rise."" Read more. About half the people who were due to get a Covid jab at a mass vaccination centre in Glasgow failed to turn up over the weekend. The BBC has learned a ""considerable"" number of no shows were recorded on both Saturday and Sunday at the Hydro. The venue can administer a minimum of 4,000 vaccinations each day, with a capacity to scale up to 10,000. Glasgow has the highest coronavirus rates in the country at 133 cases per 100,000 people in the seven days to 20 May. It is the only council area in Scotland under level three Covid restrictions and people aged 18 to 39 in certain postcode areas are being offered jabs early to tackle surging cases.

"This video can not be played DR Congo's Goma volcano: Drone images show devastation Ernestine Kabuo returned home after fleeing the lava flow in Goma, Democratic Republic of Congo, to find that her husband had not survived. The 68 year old was unable to carry her sick husband out of their house and she found him burnt to death, she told Reuters news agency. At least 22 deaths have been confirmed following Saturday's eruption of a nearby volcano, Mount Nyiragongo. But the lava stopped short of the city's built-up area. This avoided the level of death and destruction witnessed in 2002. It did, however, hit the Buhene district, where Ms Kabuo's home was. Africa Live: Latest updates from the continent In pictures: Mount Nyiragongo erupts Watch: 'I monitor Congo's deadliest volcano' ""I said to myself: I can't go alone, we've been married for the best and for the worst,"" she told Reuters reflecting on what happened on Saturday. Ernestine Kabuo was unable to save her husband ""I went back to at least try to get him out but couldn't. I ran away and he got burned inside. I don't know what to do. I curse this day."" Five people died of asphyxiation while trying to cross the lava when it was cooling in a place just north of Goma. A sixth person is in hospital with breathing difficulties, civil society leader Mambo Kawaya told the AFP news agency. Since then, the authorities have tried to prevent people from visiting places where the lava is cooling, Goma journalist Esdras Tsongo told the BBC's Focus on Africa radio programme. Other Goma residents, a city of 670,000 according to UN estimates, are searching for missing loved ones as the city, and the region, continues to experience earthquakes. More than 170 children are feared to be missing and 150 others had been separated from their families, the UN's children's agency, Unicef, said, adding that centres would be set up to help unaccompanied minors. Please refresh your browser Nine of the deaths so far recorded by the authorities occurred in a traffic accident as people fled. Four others died as they tried to escape a prison while two were burned to death, government spokesman Patrick Muyaya said on Sunday. But there are fears that more deaths may be confirmed as people return to the remains of their houses. The lava stopped in the Buhene district, on the outskirts of Goma, burying hundreds of houses and even large buildings. Reconstruction efforts are likely to take months. ""All the houses in Buhene neighbourhood were burned,"" Innocent Bahala Shamavu told the Associated Press news agency. Local people have been sifting through the remains of flattened houses Elsewhere, lava crossed the N2 road connecting Goma to the city of Beni, severing a key aid and supply route. However, the city's airport was untouched, despite earlier reports that it had been affected. The volcano, located 10km (six miles) from Goma, last erupted in 2002, killing 250 people and making 120,000 homeless. Residents started leaving their houses even before the government announced an evacuation plan. At night, crowds were seen fleeing on foot with mattresses and other belongings. Rwandan authorities said more than 3,000 people had officially crossed from Goma. Some started to return on Sunday. Others went to higher ground to the west of the city. One Goma resident, Richard Bahati, said he was in his house when he heard screaming and became extremely worried as he saw the sky reddening outside. ""I lived through the problem with this volcano in 2002. The volcano devastated all our homes and possessions,"" he said. A local trader, Kambere Ombeni, was among those who returned to the scene as the rubble still smouldered. ""We watched the whole neighbourhood in the Nyiragongo territory go up in smoke. The fire came right down to here. Even now we can still see lava,"" he said. Another resident, Irene Bauma, said people would need help from the government to rebuild their lives. ""There's land, people, a population that has lost everything, maybe there are also deaths, who knows? We are asking the government to come and help the survivors of this eruption."" Tom Peyre-Costa, from the Norwegian Refugee Council in Goma, told the BBC what had happened. ""The lava was pretty slow, like, 1km/h, but it didn't stop.... It started burning the houses,"" he said, adding that humanitarian organisations were already trying to address people's needs. This image captured on Saturday shows how the lava was destroying everything in its path Mount Nyiragongo is one of the world's more active volcanoes but there were concerns that its activity had not been properly observed by the Goma Volcano Observatory, since the World Bank cut funding amid allegations of corruption. Professor Mike Burton, a volcanologist at the University of Manchester in England, told the BBC that the lava in Mount Nyiragongo is particularly fluid and has the potential to move fast. In a report on 10 May, the observatory warned that seismic activity at Nyiragongo had increased. Last year, the observatory's director,Katcho Karume, told the BBC World Service's Science in Action that the volcano's lava lake had been filling up quickly,increasing the chances of an eruption in the next few years. But he also warned that an earthquake could trigger a disaster earlier. The volcano's deadliest eruption happened in 1977, when more than 600 people died.

"Phil Mickelson and his brother Tim as caddie won together at a major for the first time US PGA Championship final leaderboard -6P Mickelson (US);-4B Koepka (US), L Oosthuizen (SA);-2P Harrington (Ire), S Lowry (Ire), P Casey (Eng) H Higgs (US) Selected others: -1J Rose (Eng), C Morikawa (US);+1M Fitzpatrick (Eng), M Laird (Sco), I Poulter (Eng), H Matsuyama (Jpn);+2J Spieth (US);+5R McIlroy (NI) Phil Mickelson became the oldest man to win a major title as he claimed the US PGA Championship at Kiawah Island amid extraordinary scenes as thousands of fans swarmed on to the final fairway to witness the winning moment. It was a throwback victory for 50-year-old Mickelson and a reminder of what sport has been missing in the absence of crowds during the Covid-19 pandemic. Spectators swamped the American as he marched up to the 18th green on his way to clinching a sixth major title, eight years after his last. ""It was quite unnerving, but exceptionally awesome. I don't think I've ever experienced anything like that before,"" said Mickelson, who won on six under par at the Ocean Course after a closing one-over 73. He finished two clear of fellow American Brooks Koepka, who closed with a 74, and South Africa's Louis Oosthuizen, who signed for a 73. Mickelson takes the record of oldest major winner from Julius Boros, who won this title in 1968 at the age of 48, and also joins England's Sir Nick Faldo and American Lee Trevino as a six-time major winner. Only 11 male players have won more. ""This is just an incredible feeling. I just believed that it was possible yet everything was saying it wasn't and I hope that others find that inspiration,"" added Mickelson. ""It may take a little extra work and harder effort to maintain the physicality, or maintain the skills, but gosh is it worth it in the end. ""I just love this game and I love what I do and I love the challenge of competing against such great players."" He will now be among the favourites at next month's US Open, the only major he needs to become the sixth man to complete the career Grand Slam. It is being held near his home in San Diego at Torrey Pines, a course on which he has won three titles. Ireland's Padraig Harrington and Shane Lowry finished in a tie for fourth at two under after closing rounds of 69. They were level with American Harry Higgs and England's Paul Casey, who scored consistently throughout the week and posted his third 71 on Sunday. It's a family affair - how crucial caddie intervention inspired Mickelson victory It was a final pairing packed with potential storylines: Mickelson aiming to become the oldest major championship winner, Koepka looking for victory just two months after serious knee surgery. In the end, it was Mickelson who controlled the narrative and held his nerve during a tense final round. Koepka was eight months old when Mickelson claimed the first of his 45 PGA Tour titles as an amateur at the Northern Telecom Open in 1991 and 13 years later the American became a major champion with the first of his three Masters crowns. He added to those at the 2005 PGA Championship and 2013 Open, but victory at Kiawah Island must rank as the most remarkable after dropping out of the top 100 earlier this year for the first time since 1993. Mickelson says he has being trying to improve his concentration and stay more ""present"" by practising meditation and other drills to increase his focus and he needed all of that composure on a rollercoaster front nine. He led by one overnight on seven under, but began with a bogey and when Koepka rolled in a birdie from 12 feet a two-shot swing handed the 31-year-old the lead. But a double bogey followed for Koepka as he duffed a chip from a bank behind the second green and then watched as Mickelson clipped on before sinking a birdie putt to reclaim top spot and take a two-stroke advantage on the field. Phil Mickelson claimed his sixth major eight years after his fifth title Mickelson held on to the sole lead despite a bogey at three after two loose chips around the green, but only because Koepka missed a three-footer for birdie. Then came a moment of magic from the champion, chipping in from the sand to birdie the par-three fifth and send the Kiawah Island crowd almost delirious. Mickelson followed up with a bogey and Koepka took advantage by pulling back level, only to send a disastrous approach at seven on to the cart path on his way to another dropped shot as Mickelson got up and down for a birdie that sent him clear once more. The veteran hit the turn with his two-stroke lead intact and increased it to four at 10 with a well-made birdie as Koepka found the sand and failed to recover. The left-hander had a five-stroke lead at the same stage on Saturday, only to watch it evaporate over the next three holes, but not even a fan picking up his ball after a wayward drive at 11 could faze him this time as Mickelson saved par and Koepka bogeyed to drop five back, meaning Oosthuizen was once again his closest challenger. Having avoided the water off the tee at 13, Mickelson then found it with his approach to the green and made back-to-back bogeys, though Oosthuizen dropped two shots on the same hole after also finding the water. That meant Mickelson led by three shots with four to play. Oosthuizen, whose sole major win came at the 2010 Open, birdied the 16th to keep the fight alive but moments later Mickelson, who turns 51 next month, hit the longest drive of any player this week on the hole - 366 yards - on his way to a birdie of his own. Mickelson said he was having fun this week, though there was nothing enjoyable about the daunting par-three 17th, but he could afford to drop a shot and head to the 18th with a two-stroke advantage. Up to 10,000 fans were allowed on site each day at Kiawah Island He pushed his drive left and as he assessed his options from in front of a hospitality stand, fans started to swarm onto the fairway. After some deliberation, he hit a nine-iron into the heart of the green, and the boisterous crowd immediately surrounded Mickelson who, with the help of officials, had to push his way through to reach the putting surface to put the finishing touches on his historic win. Koepka was disappointed with his putting on Saturday and also missed several close-range attempts on Sunday. He still had an outside chance of taking the tournament to a play-off on the last but had to finish amid the madness surrounding Mickelson. ""It would have been cool if I didn't have a knee injury and got dinged a few times in the knee in that crowd,"" said the four-time major champion who took a couple of extra minutes to make his way through to the green. ""It's cool for Phil. But getting dinged a few times isn't exactly my idea of fun."" Harrington and Lowry both posted rounds of 69 on the final day An eagle at the par-five second and chip-in birdie on the 14th were the highlights of European Ryder Cup captain Harrington's round as he rolled back the years to card a three-under 69 on Sunday and finish at two under par for a share of fourth place. That is the three-time major champion's best finish at a major since winning this event in 2008. The 49-year-old had a terrific time playing with fellow Irishman Lowry and the Open champion also posted a 69 to finish at two under. ""I don't think I have enjoyed a round of golf as much as I have playing with Shane,"" said Harrington. ""It was amazing how relaxed I was from tee to green. When you have your head in the right place it is much easier to play good golf. It was a very nice pairing."" Casey also shared fourth and briefly threatened to put an early run together with back-to-back birdies on two and three, but five birdies overall were offset by four bogeys as he finished four off the lead. Justin Rose failed to break par in the opening three days but posted one of the rounds of the day with a five-under 67 that included eight birdies, a bogey and a double to leave the Englishman one under for the tournament. Northern Ireland's Rory McIlroy was unable to tame the Ocean Course as he did during his 2012 victory, with the pre-tournament favourite finishing on five over par. Jordan Spieth's wait to complete the career Grand Slam continues after he finished at two over par, one behind Japan's Masters champion Hideki Matsuyama, while US Open champion Bryson DeChambeau faded to three over par with a final-day 77. The US PGA Championship's Covid-19protocols,externalfor fans included ""no handshakes, fist bumps, autographs, photographs or selfies""; for people attending to ""respect their [players'] space and watch your distance"" and ""avoid unnecessary touchpoints and large crowds"". Fans who had not been vaccinated were advised to wear masks when they could not be socially distant. But Mickelson needed a security and police escort to make his way through the jam-packed crowd of spectators to complete his historic moment. ""I've never had that experience and to see that, to feel that kind of excitement and enthusiasm, and be at the forefront of that, was pretty special. That's a moment I'll always, always cherish."" Considering where we are in the world right now, it was sort of weird,"" Mickelson's caddie and brother Tim said about the swarming crowds. ""But it was also pretty darned cool to see."" Thousands of fans swarmed across the 18th fairway as Mickelson marched towards a sixth victory in his 112th major It took a bit of pushing and shoving but Mickelson finally got through with his putter to finish his round Mickelson credited his brother and caddie Tim as one of several people who helped him win on the big stage again The vast majority of the spectators at Kiawah Island were rooting for Mickelson to win on Sunday Jon Rahm was one of several players to congratulate Mickelson after he walked off the 18th green Allow Twitter content?

"Phil Mickelson and his brother Tim as caddie won together at a major for the first time US PGA Championship final leaderboard -6P Mickelson (US);-4B Koepka (US), L Oosthuizen (SA);-2P Harrington (Ire), S Lowry (Ire), P Casey (Eng) H Higgs (US) Selected others: -1J Rose (Eng), C Morikawa (US);+1M Fitzpatrick (Eng), M Laird (Sco), I Poulter (Eng), H Matsuyama (Jpn);+2J Spieth (US);+5R McIlroy (NI) Phil Mickelson became the oldest man to win a major title as he claimed the US PGA Championship at Kiawah Island amid extraordinary scenes as thousands of fans swarmed on to the final fairway to witness the winning moment. It was a throwback victory for 50-year-old Mickelson and a reminder of what sport has been missing in the absence of crowds during the Covid-19 pandemic. Spectators swamped the American as he marched up to the 18th green on his way to clinching a sixth major title, eight years after his last. ""It was quite unnerving, but exceptionally awesome. I don't think I've ever experienced anything like that before,"" said Mickelson, who won on six under par at the Ocean Course after a closing one-over 73. He finished two clear of fellow American Brooks Koepka, who closed with a 74, and South Africa's Louis Oosthuizen, who signed for a 73. Mickelson takes the record of oldest major winner from Julius Boros, who won this title in 1968 at the age of 48, and also joins England's Sir Nick Faldo and American Lee Trevino as a six-time major winner. Only 11 male players have won more. ""This is just an incredible feeling. I just believed that it was possible yet everything was saying it wasn't and I hope that others find that inspiration,"" added Mickelson. ""It may take a little extra work and harder effort to maintain the physicality, or maintain the skills, but gosh is it worth it in the end. ""I just love this game and I love what I do and I love the challenge of competing against such great players."" He will now be among the favourites at next month's US Open, the only major he needs to become the sixth man to complete the career Grand Slam. It is being held near his home in San Diego at Torrey Pines, a course on which he has won three titles. Ireland's Padraig Harrington and Shane Lowry finished in a tie for fourth at two under after closing rounds of 69. They were level with American Harry Higgs and England's Paul Casey, who scored consistently throughout the week and posted his third 71 on Sunday. It's a family affair - how crucial caddie intervention inspired Mickelson victory It was a final pairing packed with potential storylines: Mickelson aiming to become the oldest major championship winner, Koepka looking for victory just two months after serious knee surgery. In the end, it was Mickelson who controlled the narrative and held his nerve during a tense final round. Koepka was eight months old when Mickelson claimed the first of his 45 PGA Tour titles as an amateur at the Northern Telecom Open in 1991 and 13 years later the American became a major champion with the first of his three Masters crowns. He added to those at the 2005 PGA Championship and 2013 Open, but victory at Kiawah Island must rank as the most remarkable after dropping out of the top 100 earlier this year for the first time since 1993. Mickelson says he has being trying to improve his concentration and stay more ""present"" by practising meditation and other drills to increase his focus and he needed all of that composure on a rollercoaster front nine. He led by one overnight on seven under, but began with a bogey and when Koepka rolled in a birdie from 12 feet a two-shot swing handed the 31-year-old the lead. But a double bogey followed for Koepka as he duffed a chip from a bank behind the second green and then watched as Mickelson clipped on before sinking a birdie putt to reclaim top spot and take a two-stroke advantage on the field. Phil Mickelson claimed his sixth major eight years after his fifth title Mickelson held on to the sole lead despite a bogey at three after two loose chips around the green, but only because Koepka missed a three-footer for birdie. Then came a moment of magic from the champion, chipping in from the sand to birdie the par-three fifth and send the Kiawah Island crowd almost delirious. Mickelson followed up with a bogey and Koepka took advantage by pulling back level, only to send a disastrous approach at seven on to the cart path on his way to another dropped shot as Mickelson got up and down for a birdie that sent him clear once more. The veteran hit the turn with his two-stroke lead intact and increased it to four at 10 with a well-made birdie as Koepka found the sand and failed to recover. The left-hander had a five-stroke lead at the same stage on Saturday, only to watch it evaporate over the next three holes, but not even a fan picking up his ball after a wayward drive at 11 could faze him this time as Mickelson saved par and Koepka bogeyed to drop five back, meaning Oosthuizen was once again his closest challenger. Having avoided the water off the tee at 13, Mickelson then found it with his approach to the green and made back-to-back bogeys, though Oosthuizen dropped two shots on the same hole after also finding the water. That meant Mickelson led by three shots with four to play. Oosthuizen, whose sole major win came at the 2010 Open, birdied the 16th to keep the fight alive but moments later Mickelson, who turns 51 next month, hit the longest drive of any player this week on the hole - 366 yards - on his way to a birdie of his own. Mickelson said he was having fun this week, though there was nothing enjoyable about the daunting par-three 17th, but he could afford to drop a shot and head to the 18th with a two-stroke advantage. Up to 10,000 fans were allowed on site each day at Kiawah Island He pushed his drive left and as he assessed his options from in front of a hospitality stand, fans started to swarm onto the fairway.

"This video can not be played First pictures have emerged after the cable car fell on a mountain in northern Italy Fourteen people, including at least one child, have been killed and another child is seriously injured after a cable car fell on a mountain near Lake Maggiore in northern Italy on Sunday. The accident happened on a service transporting passengers from the resort town of Stresa up the nearby Mottarone mountain in the region of Piedmont. Images from the scene show the wreckage lying in a steep wooded area. Five Israeli nationals were among the dead, Israel's foreign ministry says. Most of the victims died at the crash site, with the death toll steadily rising on Sunday afternoon as the wreckage was searched. Officials said two survivors, children aged about five and nine, were airlifted to a hospital in Turin but the older child later died. The younger child - who is also an Israeli national - underwent surgery and is in a critical condition. ""We are devastated,"" Marcella Severino, mayor of Stresa, told broadcaster RAI. It reportedly happened at about 12:30 local time (10:30 GMT) on Sunday. The cause of the incident remains unclear, but local reports suggest the cable may have failed about 300m (984ft) from the top of the mountain. The cabin fell about 20m to the ground and rolled over down the slope before being stopped by trees, Mayor Severino said. Nearby hikers heard a loud hiss before the accident, she added. Walter Milan, an alpine rescue spokesman, told television network RaiNews24 that the cable car was left ""crumpled"". Emergency services shared an image of the deadly crash on Sunday Police were among emergency service rescuers working at the scene Rescuers faced a crash site on steep and difficult terrain. A fire service vehicle overturned while responding but no-one was injured. Stresa's mayor said victims had been found both inside and outside the wreckage of the cable car. Luisa Tesserin, a 27-year-old student from Genoa, told the AFP news agency that she and friends had been on the service about an hour before the crash happened. ""When we got on, the cable car didn't give any strange signals, everything was fine. When they told us the news, we were shocked,"" Ms Tesserin said. Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi described the crash as a ""tragic accident"" and said he was receiving updates from local and national officials. ""I express the condolences of the whole government to the families of the victims, with a special thought for the seriously injured children and their families,"" he said in a statement. Infrastructure Minister Enrico Giovannini has announced an inquiry into the incident with a local prosecutor's office also opening an investigation. EU Council PresidentCharles Michel offered his condolences to the victims' loved ones in a tweet,externalwritten in Italian, adding that ""Europe is in mourning with you"". The website for the Stresa-Alpine-Mottarone service said it usually takes 20 minutes to transport passengers 1,491m above sea level. The cable car originally opened in 1970 and was closed for maintenance between 2014 and 2016. Mottarone is situated between Lake Maggiore and Lake Orta, offering scenic views of the region for tourists. Each cable car can usually hold about 40 passengers. The service had recently reopened following the lifting of coronavirus restrictions. Are you in the area?  If it is safe to do so, share your experiences.  Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external.

""We have done everything we can do - sanitisers, distancing and track and trace in place. We just have to see how we go,"" he told BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme. However, he added that businesses would still need financial help. ""Landlords are still looking for rent and there are still wages to pay and overheads, which haven't decreased in price."" Economy Minister Diane Dodds said the continued easing of restrictions was a ""huge step forward for Northern Ireland's economy"".

"The raid happened days after Arundel Castle reopened on Tuesday A set of gold rosary beads carried by Mary Queen of Scots at her execution in 1587 was among items worth more than Â£1m stolen in a raid on Arundel Castle. The gold and silver artefacts were snatched from the West Sussex castle on Friday night. Other pieces taken during the raid include coronation cups given by Mary to the Earl Marshal. An Arundel Castle spokesman said the stolen items were of ""priceless historical importance"". The castle only reopened to the public on Tuesday. Staff were alerted to the break-in at 22:30 BST on Friday after a burglar alarm went off. Sussex Police told the BBC the thieves entered through a window and smashed a glass cabinet to grab the items. Det Con Molly O'Malley said the force thinks a 4x4 saloon found abandoned and on fire in nearby Barlavington ""was linked"" to the raid. The castle spokesman said the rosary had ""little intrinsic value as metal"" but was ""irreplaceable"". The rosary beads were carried by Mary as she was led to her death A spokesman for Arundel Castle Trustees said: ""The stolen items have significant monetary value, but as unique artefacts of the Duke of Norfolk's collection have immeasurably greater and priceless historical importance. ""We therefore urge anyone with information to come forward to the police to assist them in returning these treasures back where they belong."" Peter Squires, professor of criminology at the University of Brighton, said there was a ""surprising amount"" of thefts of ""antiquities or cultural artefacts"". He said items were often stolen to order and end up in the private collections of very rich people. He told BBC Radio Sussex: ""In war zones in the Middle East, there is a lot of evidence of museums being looted and the stolen items quickly finding themselves on to the dark web where they are bid on by dealers. ""Gold of course may just be melted down, which massively reduces its value, so to find someone who wants the items rather than just the bullion value is the thieves' objective here."" The items were taken from a display cabinet, police say Professor Kate Williams of Reading University said: ""When [Mary] fled Scotland into England most of her belongings were despoiled and shared out. ""Then after she was executed, nearly everything she had was taken and burned because people were concerned she would turn into a Catholic martyr. ""So we had one tiny memorial of Mary Queen of Scots - and now it has gone."" Det Con O'Malley urged people who were in Arundel on Friday evening and saw any suspicious activity around the area of the castle to contact the force either online or by calling 101, quoting Operation Deuce. ""The castle only re-opened to visitors on Tuesday 18 May, so if you were visiting during the past few days do you on reflection recall anyone behaving at all suspiciously?"" he said. Mary Queen of Scots was held in captivity for 18 years before she was executed Mary was born at Linlithgow Palace in 1542 and became queen when her father died soon after her birth However, Mary was taken to France in 1548 and Scotland was ruled by regents She returned in 1561 to begin her reign as Queen of Scots but was forced to abdicate at the age of 24 after six tumultuous years After an unsuccessful attempt to regain the throne, Mary fled to England seeking the protection of her cousin, Elizabeth I Mary had once claimed Elizabeth's throne as her own and was considered the legitimate sovereign by many English Catholics The Scots queen was held in captivity for 18 years before she was executed at Fotheringhay Castle in 1587, at the age of 44 Her son James became king of Scotland and England Mary, Queen of Scots film 'problematic' Mary Queen of Scots documents found Fierce winds threaten more fire destruction as LA struggles to contain blazes Powerful images of loss and heroism from LA UK has enough gas says No 10 after storage warning What's the latest on the Los Angeles wildfires and what caused them?

"Carwyn Jones stepped down as a member of the Senedd this month after 22 years Tackling climate change slipped ""down the agenda"" in the years following the 2008 financial crash, according to Wales' former first minister. Carwyn Jones was defending his record in power after being announced as chair of climate charity Size of Wales. Mr Jones, a Senedd member for 22 years, said the issue needed to be the world's ""top priority"", warning communities and livelihoods risked being ""destroyed"". Hestood down from the Seneddahead of the election earlier this month. Mr Jones said he now wanted to make campaigning for action on climate change - ""the biggest challenge that humanity has faced since the second world war"" - a focus of his post-politics life. Greener Wales 'must not hit poorer communities' New targets to eliminate climate change gases Â£40m emissions cut plan from industry During his time as first minister between 2009 and 2018, major new laws such as the Environment Act and Well-being of Future Generations Act were passed, but Wales consistently failed to meet tree-planting targets and experienced years when greenhouse gas emissions went up instead of down. Pressed on his actions in office, he said there was ""always more to do"". This video can not be played University Hospital of Wales staff are planting trees to offset the environmental impact of treating Covid patients He pointed to support for public transport and the creation of Transport for Wales as examples of positive action, despite criticism from the environment sector that emissions from transport only fell 3% in Wales between 1990 and 2016. ""I think the problem we've had in the past decade is people seem to be more supportive of dealing with climate change when they feel financially secure,"" he said. ""After 2008 andthe crash that happened there, climate change started to go down the agenda across the world. ""People were more interested in the need to prop up our economies, making sure people have money in their pockets and are secure. ""The two things are not contradictory, and I'm glad to see now that climate change is going back up the agenda across the world."" While the pandemic had shown how changes could be instigated quickly, it had also highlighted a problem of ""countries not working together"", something that needed to be addressed in responding to global warming, he warned. This video can not be played Could changes we have been forced to make in the pandemic become long-term environmental solutions? His successor Mark Drakeford's decision to set up a climate change department in the Welsh government with a new minister and deputy minister to take charge of the issue was a ""hugely important signal"", he said. ""We can give practical examples to show other countries that we're doing our bit in Wales - we're a small country but we can have a positive effect,"" he said. Size of Wales' director Nicola Pulman said the former first minister would bring ""a track record at the highest level of government in tackling climate change"" to the charity's work. It supports forest protection and tree growing projects in Africa, South America and south-east Asia as well as running a Wales-wide educational programme to help teach young people about climate change.

"This video can not be played First pictures have emerged after the cable car fell on a mountain in northern Italy Fourteen people, including at least one child, have been killed and another child is seriously injured after a cable car fell on a mountain near Lake Maggiore in northern Italy on Sunday. The accident happened on a service transporting passengers from the resort town of Stresa up the nearby Mottarone mountain in the region of Piedmont. Images from the scene show the wreckage lying in a steep wooded area. Five Israeli nationals were among the dead, Israel's foreign ministry says. Most of the victims died at the crash site, with the death toll steadily rising on Sunday afternoon as the wreckage was searched. Officials said two survivors, children aged about five and nine, were airlifted to a hospital in Turin but the older child later died. The younger child - who is also an Israeli national - underwent surgery and is in a critical condition. ""We are devastated,"" Marcella Severino, mayor of Stresa, told broadcaster RAI. It reportedly happened at about 12:30 local time (10:30 GMT) on Sunday. The cause of the incident remains unclear, but local reports suggest the cable may have failed about 300m (984ft) from the top of the mountain. The cabin fell about 20m to the ground and rolled over down the slope before being stopped by trees, Mayor Severino said. Nearby hikers heard a loud hiss before the accident, she added. Walter Milan, an alpine rescue spokesman, told television network RaiNews24 that the cable car was left ""crumpled"". Emergency services shared an image of the deadly crash on Sunday Police were among emergency service rescuers working at the scene Rescuers faced a crash site on steep and difficult terrain. A fire service vehicle overturned while responding but no-one was injured. Stresa's mayor said victims had been found both inside and outside the wreckage of the cable car. Luisa Tesserin, a 27-year-old student from Genoa, told the AFP news agency that she and friends had been on the service about an hour before the crash happened. ""When we got on, the cable car didn't give any strange signals, everything was fine. When they told us the news, we were shocked,"" Ms Tesserin said. Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi described the crash as a ""tragic accident"" and said he was receiving updates from local and national officials. ""I express the condolences of the whole government to the families of the victims, with a special thought for the seriously injured children and their families,"" he said in a statement. Infrastructure Minister Enrico Giovannini has announced an inquiry into the incident with a local prosecutor's office also opening an investigation. EU Council PresidentCharles Michel offered his condolences to the victims' loved ones in a tweet,externalwritten in Italian, adding that ""Europe is in mourning with you"". The website for the Stresa-Alpine-Mottarone service said it usually takes 20 minutes to transport passengers 1,491m above sea level. The cable car originally opened in 1970 and was closed for maintenance between 2014 and 2016. Mottarone is situated between Lake Maggiore and Lake Orta, offering scenic views of the region for tourists. Each cable car can usually hold about 40 passengers. The service had recently reopened following the lifting of coronavirus restrictions. Are you in the area?  If it is safe to do so, share your experiences.  Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external.

"Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko, Europe's longest-serving ruler, is facing unprecedented opposition to his power. The 66-year-old former Soviet farm boss claimed a sixth term as president in a widely disputed election on 9 August. He has faced weeks of mass protests against his rule. About 100,000 people have rallied against him weekly in Minsk - by far the biggest opposition protests of his rule. Mr Lukashenko has been in power since 1994, with an authoritarian style reminiscent of the Soviet era, controlling the main media channels, harassing and jailing political opponents and marginalising independent voices. The country's powerful secret police - still called the KGB - closely monitors dissidents. Political novice Svetlana Tikhanovskaya is now Mr Lukashenko's main political rival. She stepped in to challenge him for the presidency after her husband Sergei Tikhanovsky, a popular blogger, was barred from running and sent to jail. On 30 July a huge crowd rallied in support of Svetlana Tikhanovskaya She claims to have won 60-70% in places where votes were properly counted - but the president claimed a landslide victory. None of the previous presidential elections held during Mr Lukashenko's long reign were ever judged free and fair by the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), a top election monitoring body. The mother challenging Belarus's longtime ruler Belarus ban on election challengers stirs protests Why does Lukashenko take son Kolya to work? But the latest vote, and subsequent crackdown with thousands arrested, has sparked the widest condemnation yet. Major opposition figures, including Ms Tikhanovskaya, are now in exile in neighbouring countries, amid a wave of arrests. For years Mr Lukashenko has sought to convince the nation of 9.5 million that he is the best guarantor of stability, a tough nationalist protecting them from foreign meddling. That message still appeals to many older Belarusians. The country was devastated in World War Two - victim of a Nazi scorched-earth policy - and lost nearly one-third of its population. So suspicion of foreigners and pride in the security forces play well among many voters. Victory parade defies pandemic and upstages Putin Back in 2005 the administration of then US President George W Bush called Belarus ""the last remaining true dictatorship in the heart of Europe"". Mr Lukashenko once warned that anyone joining an opposition protest would be treated as a ""terrorist"", adding: ""We will wring their necks, as one might a duck"". This video can not be played Activists and journalists were rounded up and jailed in Belarus before the election In recent years, however, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orban have also drawn strong Western criticism for harassing opponents and extending state power. Coronavirus has added an extra dimension to the political ferment in Belarus. Opponents consider Mr Lukashenko's bravado about the virus to be reckless and a sign that he is out of touch. In late May he said Belarus was right not to lock down. ""You see that in the affluent West, unemployment is out of control. People are banging on pots. People want to eat. Thank God, we avoided this. We didn't shut down."" In March, as countries across Europe were imposing lockdowns, he said: ""I am convinced that we may suffer more from panic than from the virus"". He suggested combating the virus with hard work, the sauna and vodka. When the rest of Europe cancelled football matches the continuing Belarus fixtures - still drawing big crowds to stadiums - suddenly attracted international interest. Belarus league plays on amid coronavirus In February Mr Lukashenko (C) played against Mr Putin (L) in a friendly ice hockey match in Sochi, Russia Before the election Mr Lukashenko's security chiefs accused unnamed Russian forces of trying to help his opponents and foment unrest. Russia remains Belarus's chief ally - they have held joint military exercises and the struggling Belarus economy relies on trade with its powerful neighbour. But in recent years relations have cooled since Moscow moved to end subsidised oil and gas supplies. Belarus authorities arrested 33 Russians near Minsk - all but one at a sanatorium - in July and said they belonged to Wagner, a shadowy Russian mercenary group active in Ukraine, Africa and the Middle East. Russia denied the Belarusian claim that the detained Russians were plotting acts of terrorism, insisting that they were actually in transit, waiting for a flight to Istanbul. They were later released. Belarus accuses 'Russian mercenaries' of plot A former Soviet state farm director, Mr Lukashenko became president in 1994 after leading an anti-corruption drive in parliament. In the August 1991 botched coup attempt against then Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, Mr Lukashenko supported the communist hardliners. Like Vladimir Putin, Mr Lukashenko remains nostalgic for the Soviet Union. And both are keen ice hockey players. This video can not be played A rare audience with Belarus' President Alexander Lukashenko A referendum in 2004 lifted the two-term limit on presidents, making it possible for Mr Lukashenko to lead Belarus indefinitely. His origins were humble - raised by a single mother in a poor village in eastern Belarus. He is married to Galina Lukashenko, with whom he has two adult sons, Viktor and Dmitry. He told an interviewer in 2015 that he had no intention of divorcing Galina, although they have not lived together for decades. He has a third son, Nikolai, born in 2004, whose mother Irina Abelskaya was Mr Lukashenko's personal doctor. ""An authoritarian style of rule is characteristic of me, and I have always admitted it,"" he said in August 2003. ""You need to control the country, and the main thing is not to ruin people's lives."" Despite the mass unrest, Mr Lukashenko insists he will not leave office - but has acknowledged some Belarusians might be ""fed up"" with his rule. He said Belarus could not return to the instability of the years following the break-up of the Soviet Union in 1991, and he has twice appeared brandishing a gun during the protests. President Putin says he has formed a police reserve force to intervene in Belarus if necessary - as requested by Mr Lukashenko. Russia could send them in if the protests  got really ""out of control"", Mr Putin said.

The 68 year old was unable to carry her sick husband out of their house and she found him burnt to death, she told Reuters news agency. At least 22 deaths have been confirmed following Saturday's eruption of a nearby volcano, Mount Nyiragongo. But the lava stopped short of the city's built-up area. This avoided the level of death and destruction witnessed in 2002. It did, however, hit the Buhene district, where Ms Kabuo's home was. Africa Live: Latest updates from the continent In pictures: Mount Nyiragongo erupts Watch: 'I monitor Congo's deadliest volcano' ""I said to myself: I can't go alone, we've been married for the best and for the worst,"" she told Reuters reflecting on what happened on Saturday. Ernestine Kabuo was unable to save her husband ""I went back to at least try to get him out but couldn't. I ran away and he got burned inside. I don't know what to do. I curse this day."" Five people died of asphyxiation while trying to cross the lava when it was cooling in a place just north of Goma. A sixth person is in hospital with breathing difficulties, civil society leader Mambo Kawaya told the AFP news agency. Since then, the authorities have tried to prevent people from visiting places where the lava is cooling, Goma journalist Esdras Tsongo told the BBC's Focus on Africa radio programme. Other Goma residents, a city of 670,000 according to UN estimates, are searching for missing loved ones as the city, and the region, continues to experience earthquakes. More than 170 children are feared to be missing and 150 others had been separated from their families, the UN's children's agency, Unicef, said, adding that centres would be set up to help unaccompanied minors.

Four others died as they tried to escape a prison while two were burned to death, government spokesman Patrick Muyaya said on Sunday. But there are fears that more deaths may be confirmed as people return to the remains of their houses. The lava stopped in the Buhene district, on the outskirts of Goma, burying hundreds of houses and even large buildings. Reconstruction efforts are likely to take months. ""All the houses in Buhene neighbourhood were burned,"" Innocent Bahala Shamavu told the Associated Press news agency. Local people have been sifting through the remains of flattened houses Elsewhere, lava crossed the N2 road connecting Goma to the city of Beni, severing a key aid and supply route. However, the city's airport was untouched, despite earlier reports that it had been affected. The volcano, located 10km (six miles) from Goma, last erupted in 2002, killing 250 people and making 120,000 homeless. Residents started leaving their houses even before the government announced an evacuation plan. At night, crowds were seen fleeing on foot with mattresses and other belongings. Rwandan authorities said more than 3,000 people had officially crossed from Goma. Some started to return on Sunday. Others went to higher ground to the west of the city. One Goma resident, Richard Bahati, said he was in his house when he heard screaming and became extremely worried as he saw the sky reddening outside. ""I lived through the problem with this volcano in 2002. The volcano devastated all our homes and possessions,"" he said. A local trader, Kambere Ombeni, was among those who returned to the scene as the rubble still smouldered. ""We watched the whole neighbourhood in the Nyiragongo territory go up in smoke. The fire came right down to here. Even now we can still see lava,"" he said. Another resident, Irene Bauma, said people would need help from the government to rebuild their lives. ""There's land, people, a population that has lost everything, maybe there are also deaths, who knows? We are asking the government to come and help the survivors of this eruption."" Tom Peyre-Costa, from the Norwegian Refugee Council in Goma, told the BBC what had happened. ""The lava was pretty slow, like, 1km/h, but it didn't stop.... It started burning the houses,"" he said, adding that humanitarian organisations were already trying to address people's needs. This image captured on Saturday shows how the lava was destroying everything in its path Mount Nyiragongo is one of the world's more active volcanoes but there were concerns that its activity had not been properly observed by the Goma Volcano Observatory, since the World Bank cut funding amid allegations of corruption. Professor Mike Burton, a volcanologist at the University of Manchester in England, told the BBC that the lava in Mount Nyiragongo is particularly fluid and has the potential to move fast. In a report on 10 May, the observatory warned that seismic activity at Nyiragongo had increased. Last year, the observatory's director,Katcho Karume, told the BBC World Service's Science in Action that the volcano's lava lake had been filling up quickly,increasing the chances of an eruption in the next few years. But he also warned that an earthquake could trigger a disaster earlier. The volcano's deadliest eruption happened in 1977, when more than 600 people died.

"This video can not be played Roman Protasevich's father tells the BBC's Sarah Rainsford he is fearful his son may be tortured Western countries have condemned Belarus for diverting a plane flying over its territory to arrest an opposition journalist. EU leaders are due to discuss their response to what the union's executive called a ""hijacking"" and the US state department said was ""a shocking act"". Belarus scrambled a fighter jet to force the plane - bound for Lithuania - to land, claiming a bomb threat. Police took Roman Protasevich away when passengers disembarked. The 26-year-old was aboard the Ryanair plane, which was flying from the Greek capital, Athens. The aircraft was due to land in Vilnius, but was still in Belarusian airspace when it was told to divert to Minsk, the capital of Belarus. Witnesses said the activist was ""super-scared"" and told fellow passengers he would face the death penalty - Belarus is the only European country that still executes prisoners. State media in Belarus saidPresident Alexander Lukashenko had personally given the order,externalfor the move. The plane landed in Vilnius more than six hours after its scheduled arrival. Follow live updates here Passengers describe panic on Belarus Ryanair plane What action can the EU take against Belarus? Since winning a disputed election last August, Mr Lukashenko, 66, who has ruled the country since 1994, has cracked down on dissenting voices. Many opposition figures have been arrested, while others fled into exile. The incident drew sharp condemnation from across the European Union, with countries urging the immediate release of Mr Protasevich and a full investigation. The EU later summoned the Belarusian ambassador and informed him of the bloc's ""firm condemnation"". Dozens of Belarusian officials, including President Lukashenko, are already under EU sanctions including travel bans and asset freezes, imposed in response to the repression on opponents. Several countries, including the UK and Lithuania, have told flights to avoid Belarusian airspace. UK Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said he issued the instructions ""in order to keep passengers safe"". Flight FR4978 turned east to Minsk shortly before it reached the Lithuanian border. Lithuanian officials, citing Ryanair, said 126 passengers boarded the plane in Greece. In a statement, Irish carrier Ryanair said the crew had been ""notified by Belarus (Air Traffic Control) of a potential security threat on board and were instructed to divert to the nearest airport, Minsk"". But Tadeusz Giczan - the editor of Nexta, the media outlet Mr Protasevich used to work for - tweeted thatagents from Belarusian security service the KGB had boarded the plane and were the source of the bomb alert,external. Franak Viacorka, a friend and associate of Mr Protasevich, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the journalist ""already felt something bad"" in Athens airport because he had seen that someone was following him. Some passengers described seeing Mr Protasevich looking nervous as the incident unfolded. ""He just turned to people and said he was facing the death penalty,"" Monika Simkiene told AFP news agency. Another passenger told Reuters news agency that Mr Protasevich had opened an overhead locker after they were told of the diversion, pulled out a laptop and a phone and gave them to a female companion. Mr Viacorka said the woman, who was Mr Protasevich's girlfriend and was arrested with him, was ""not involved at all in anything, but they will be pursuing her because she's a close person to him"". She has been named as Sofia Sapega, a Russian citizen. ""This was a case of state-sponsored hijacking... state-sponsored piracy,"" Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary told Irish Newstalk radio on Monday. ""It appears the intent of the authorities was to remove a journalist and his travelling companion... we believe there were some KGB agents offloaded at the airport as well,"" Mr O'Leary said. Later on Monday, Lithuanian officials said five passengers who boarded the flight in Athens did not reach Vilnius. ""The latest... is that 126 passengers left Athens and 121 landed in Vilnius. This does not include the crew of six,"" a spokeswoman for the Lithuanian prime minister told Reuters. EU leaders are expected to discuss the incident at a summit in Brussels later on Monday. Nato ambassadors are due to meet on Tuesday. A package of measures being worked on includes a ban on overflights of Belarus, a ban on entry to European airports by national carrier Belavia and a suspension of ground transport links, French officials say. Ursula von der Leyen, head of the European Commission, said ""the outrageous and illegal behaviour... will have consequences"". Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda urged the EU to impose fresh economic sanctions. He told the BBC this ""could make a larger impact on the behaviour of the Belarusian regime"". The country has advised its citizens against travel to Belarus, and urged those already in the country to leave. Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said actions, not words, and sanctions with ""a real edge"" were needed. ""We cannot allow this incident to pass on the basis of warnings or strong press releases,"" he told state broadcaster RTE. UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said Mr Protasevich had been arrested ""on the basis of a ruse"" and called for his immediate release. Mr Protasevich is a former editor of Nexta, a media operation with a Telegram channel. He left Belarus in 2019 to live in exile in Lithuania. From there he covered the events of the 2020 presidential election, after which he was charged with terrorism and inciting riots. Nexta played a key role for the opposition during the vote, which was won by Mr Lukashenko and is widely regarded as rigged. It has continued to do so in its aftermath, particularly with the government imposing news blackouts. But he first attracted the attention of the authorities as a teenager, when he was expelled from school after taking part in a protest in 2011. Mr Protasevich now works for a different Telegram channel, Belamova. He stepped in to write for it after blogger Igor Losik was arrested by the Belarusian authorities in June last year. How Nexta channel bypassed Belarus news blackout Why wearing the wrong socks is risky in Belarus TV journalists jailed for filming Belarus protest He was in Athens to attend an economic conference along with Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, the opposition leader who claimed victory in the election. She too now lives in exile in Lithuania. Where is Belarus?It has its ally Russia to the east and Ukraine to the south. To the north and west lie EU and Nato members Latvia, Lithuania and Poland. Why does it matter?Like Ukraine, this nation of 9.5 million is caught in rivalry between the West and Russia. President Lukashenko has been nicknamed ""Europe's last dictator"" - he has been in power for 27 years. What's going on there?There is a huge opposition movement demanding new, democratic leadership and economic reform. The opposition movement and Western governments say Mr Lukashenko rigged the 9 August election. Officially he won by a landslide. A huge police crackdown has curbed street protests and sent opposition leaders to prison or into exile. Were you on the flight? Share your experiences by emailinghaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external.
