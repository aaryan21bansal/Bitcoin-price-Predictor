"New arrivals into the UK from abroad have to test themselves for Covid-19 using a kit delivered by approved vendors There are still ""serious problems"" among private Covid testing firms, with rogue operators making misleading claims, says consumer group Which?. Most travellers to the UK are required to pre-book tests for day two and day eight after their return. But several test providers on a government approved list are offering misleading information about pricing and availability, Which? found. The Department for Health said it was carefully monitoring test providers. Problems with private test providers first came to light in April when there was an increase in the number of people travelling. Several firms, listed by the government as approved providers, failed to deliver test kits on time, or failed to return results. Travellers were left quarantining at home unsure how to meet government testing requirements and in many cases unable to reach the testing companies online or by phone. Some didn't receive test kits at all, despite having paid hundreds of pounds. A few received results for tests they hadn't taken. Covid firm 'sorry' for negative test results error What's happening with foreign travel? US eases travel rules for 61 countries, but not UK Since 17 May the rules on international travel have been eased, and the vast majority of countries are on the government's ""amber"" list meaning travellers, including UK nationals, must pre-book a two-test package before they are allowed into the UK. Now, Which? has found some providers are quoting headline prices for one test, when two are required. Others are marketing tests although they aren't ready to deliver them. ""Weeks on from some international travel being allowed to resume, it's very concerning to still be uncovering such serious problems with the government's testing system for travellers - problems that could have easily been ironed out well ahead of travel restarting, had proper regulatory oversight been ensured early on,"" said Rory Boland, travel editor at Which? ""As it stands, travellers risk being left at the mercy of rogue operators who, at best, attempt to profiteer off of those looking for testing services to allow them to travel, and at worst, risk leaving them out of pocket for services that don't even exist."" He said the government needed to sort out problems at testing firms before mass travel resumes, to avoid ""chaos for travellers"". Confused pricing In late May, Which? investigated the three cheapest offers, that appeared on the list of approved providers from the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC). The prices offered by Biograd Diagnostics, Screen 4 and Book A Travel Test were between Â£60 and Â£98. However, when Which? investigated further it found the quoted prices were for a single test, not the compulsory two-test package. Almost all travellers to the UK are required to take two Covid tests The firms involved said the problem lay with how the DHSC recorded price information. ""A number of companies including ourselves were initially confused by the government listing forms,"" said a Book A Travel Test spokesperson. ""We have gone to great lengths to support travellers, however, we are not immune to costs and have had to navigate fluctuating charges from labs. We remain committed to doing all we can to deliver an excellent service to travellers during this difficult time.'' A Screen 4 spokesperson said the problem lay in ""differences in terminology"". ""We do not and have never tried to manipulate the listings and we have tried to provide a competitive and reliable service with clearly stated capacity of tests available,"" Screen 4 said. Following Which's enquiries the headline listed prices of several firms rose. However Which? said the underlying problem had not been corrected, as subsequently other firms were still quoting prices for a single test, making it appear that tests are available at half the true cost. Which? also found that among the DHSC's accredited providers, several were not yet able to provide tests. Following Which?'s enquiries three firms were removed from the list. The consumer group said taken together the problems suggested a lack of regulatory oversight and called for the government to explore options for reducing the cost of testing and to ensure providers were offering accurate information. A DHSC spokesperson said: ""The government regularly evaluates all providers' performance, including their delivery and test turnaround times. ""Providers who do not meet the minimum standards set by DHSC and reviewed by the independent United Kingdom Accreditation Service (UKAS), or where our monitoring highlights concerns about their customer service performance, are removed from the gov.uk travel test list. Additionally, providers may not appear on the list where they are temporarily out of stock.""

"Health minister Nadine Dorries wants women to feel they can demand different treatment, if they are unhappy with how medical staff are looking after them. Ms Dorries, who deals with patient safety, suicide prevention and mental health, said she was ""very aware"" women faced inequalities in healthcare. She said unconscious biases against women had ""always been an issue"". It comes as the government calls for public views to informEngland's first women's health strategy.,external Ms Dorries said: ""I want women to be more confident and not to take no for an answer. ""And if you are still in pain and if you are not being taken seriously and if your GP is not referring you on for consultant treatment then ask for it - demand it - because it is your right to do so."" Asked by BBC Radio 4'sWoman's Hourpresenter Emma Barnett if she thought the NHS was ""sexist"", Ms Dorries said: ""I think sexist is a strong word to use, particularly about a system which has a predominate number of female doctors and nurses working within it. This video can not be played Nadine Dorries MP thinks women need to advocate for themselves to have their medical needs taken seriously. ""But I think the system gets into the people who are working within the system - and they become part of that system -  possibly sometimes unknowingly."" She added that women often told her they had not been listened to, and this had been a core theme of many inquires, reports and recommendations. Ms Dorries said: ""I think there has been unconscious biases against women since the beginning of time. I'm going back to the whole connection between hysterectomy and hysteria for example."" Meanwhile Elinor Cleghorn, medical historian and author, told the same programme she thought the NHS was systemically sexist. But she said: ""I feel strongly that the responsibility for changing medical culture should not be on women"". She said this was particularly the case when women's concerns had been dismissed. She discussed her own diagnosis of lupus - an autoimmune disease - which she explained happened after many years of trying to get answers for her symptoms. Meanwhile Professor Martin Marshall, chair of the Royal College of GPs, said women's health was a major priority for the college. He added: ""GPs want to work with their patients to make shared and mutually acceptable decisions about their health, based on their individual circumstances, taking into account benefits and risks, as well as patient need."" In the online call for public evidence to inform the women's health strategy, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: "" For generations, women have lived with a health and care system that is mostly designed by men, for men. ""This has meant that not enough is known about conditions that only affect women, or about how conditions that affect both men and women impact women in different ways."" He added that this could lead to poorer advice, diagnoses and worse outcomes. About 100,000 women, organisations, clinicians and carers have responded to the call for evidence so far. But the government says its early findings show some groups are under-represented. Ministers are urging women from minority ethnic backgrounds, people living in the Midlands and east of England, women between the ages of 16 and 18 years old and those over 50, to respond.

"The government acted unlawfully when it awarded a Â£560,000 contract to a firm run by former colleagues of Michael Gove and the PM's adviser Dominic Cummings, the High Court has ruled. Mr Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, denied any favouritism had been shown to market research agency Public First. But the judge said a failure to consider other firms could be seen as suggesting a ""real danger"" of bias. Public First looked into public understanding of coronavirus. Campaigners took legal action against Mr Gove over the Cabinet Office's decision to use the company following the start of the pandemic last year. They also questioned the involvement of Mr Cummings, who worked in Downing Street until he quit as the prime minister's chief adviser last autumn. Lawyers for the Good Law Project argued that Mr Cummings wanted focus group and communications support services work to be given to Public First, whose founding partners were Rachel Wolf and James Frayne. In 2011, Mr Frayne became director of communications at the Department of Education, where he worked alongside Mr Cummings, who was a special adviser to Mr Gove, the then education secretary. Ms Wolf formerly worked as an adviser to Mr Gove and for Mr Cummings, and co-wrote the Conservatives' 2019 general election manifesto. Dominic Cummings said the amounts spent on focus groups had been ""trivial"" in the context of the Covid-19 crisis The government and Mr Cummings disputed the Good Law Project's claim. Delivering her ruling, Mrs Justice O'Farrell said: ""The claimant is entitled to a declaration that the decision of 5 June 2020 to award the contract to Public First gave rise to apparent bias and was unlawful."" She said: ""The defendant's failure to consider any other research agency, by reference to experience, expertise, availability or capacity, would lead a fair-minded and informed observer to conclude that there was a real possibility, or a real danger, that the decision-maker was biased."" But she also said: ""The fair-minded and informed observer would have appreciated that there was an urgent need or research through focus groups on effective communications in response to the Covid-19 crisis and that those research services were required immediately."" Mr Cummings had been ""uniquely placed, given his experience and expertise, to form a rapid view on which organisation might best be able to deliver those urgent requirements"", the judge said. The High Court rejected two other claims made against the government by the Good Law Project. The first was that the ""direct"" award of the contract to Public First was ""unnecessary"" because there were other firms who could potentially have done the work. The second was that giving it a six-month contract was ""disproportionate"" for the government's ""immediate"" needs - and that a shorter arrangement could have been followed by a ""competitive process"" for a longer contract. In his witness statement, Mr Cummings told the court: ""The country was facing an unprecedented national emergency. Thousands of lives were at stake, hundreds of billions of pounds were at stake. ""The extra money spent on doubling the focus groups and polling was essentially irrelevant in those circumstances. ""A few people did raise the question of how we could justify this as value for money. I responded that this was not the normal world, we were in a once-a-century pandemic and many thousands of pounds here was trivial if it helped us save lives and minimise economic destruction."" After the High Court ruling, he tweeted: ""When it became clear [the Department of Health, Public Health England and the Cabinet Office] weren't gathering vital data, I acted urgently. This data immediately helped key decisions and saved lives."" But Good Law Project director Jo Maugham said: ""This is not government for the public good - it is government for the good of friends of the Conservative Party."" Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner accused the government of acting ""immorally and unethically"". ""In the middle of a deadly pandemic not only were those at the heart of government giving out taxpayers' money to their friends and associates, they have wasted even more trying to cover it up,"" she added. However, a Public First spokesman said the company was ""deeply proud of the work we did in the early stages of the pandemic, which helped save lives"". He added: ""The judge rejected most of the Good Law Project's claims, not finding actual bias in the awarding of this work, nor any problems with the pace or scale of the award."" And the Cabinet Office said: ""The judgement makes clear that there was no suggestion of actual bias and that the decision to award the contract was not due to any personal or professional connections.""

"Travel industry figures have dismissed the latest moves by the US and UK to reopen travel. A new taskforce will be set up to make recommendations on easing restrictions as part of an ""Atlantic Charter"", set to be agreed on Thursday. A Number 10 statement said the prime minister and president would ""work to relaunch UK-US travel as soon as possible"". But the boss of Virgin Atlantic said the announcement ""falls short"". Chief executive Shai Weiss said: ""The creation of the Atlantic Taskforce is positive recognition of the importance of the UK-US travel corridor and a first step towards reopening the skies."" But he said the lack of a specific time frame for reopening travel meant airlines, businesses and passengers faced a lack of certainty. Ahead of the start of the G7 summit in Cornwall, Mr Weiss urged Mr Biden and Mr Johnson to allow trans-Atlantic travel no later than 4 July. Nearly all passengers from the UK are currently banned from travelling to the US. Under a presidential decree introduced last March, non-US citizens who have been in the UK in the last 14 days cannot enter the countryunless a specific exemption applies.,external Meanwhile, travellers from the US to the UK must self-isolate for 10 days on arrival as the country is on the""amber list"",external. Read more on restrictions when travelling to Amber list countrieshere. Clive Wratten, chief executive of the Business Travel Association, also called for a firm commitment on a date. ""We welcome the formation of the Atlantic Charter 2021 as a step in the right direction for transatlantic travel. ""However, this is the latest in a long line of travel taskforces which so far have only wreaked further devastation on our industry. Jobs won't be saved, nor livelihoods protected, until we are given a certainty on dates for the resumption of international travel."" A spokeswoman for the Association of British Travel Agents said that ""steps to get travel restarted are very welcome"". But she also pointed out the lack of detail in the announcement. She added: ""Consideration should also be given to capitalising on the success of the UK vaccine rollout by relaxing rules for fully vaccinated individuals when travelling between low-risk areas, as the US, and many other countries, are already doing."" The taskforce will be overseen in the UK by Transport Secretary Grant Shapps and will be chaired by senior officials in the US and UK. It will ""work to explore options for resuming US-UK travel and ensure that the UK and US closely share thinking and expertise on international travel policy going forward"", Downing Street said in a statement. Airline bosses demand UK-US travel corridor Travel sector 'frustrated' over rule changes It added: ""Links between the UK and US are not only crucial for our people, they create and sustain jobs across and throughout our two countries."" In a letter callingfor trans-Atlantic travel to reopen on Monday, airline bosses and Heathrow Airport estimated that UK businesses are losing Â£23m each day that the route remains closed. Boris Johnson and Joe Biden will also agree to work together on issues such as the post-pandemic recovery, climate change and security as part of Atlantic Charter, which is expected to be agreed when they meet on Thursday in Cornwall. The original Atlantic Charter was a joint statement made by Winston Churchill and Franklin D Roosevelt in 1941, setting out joint goals in the wake of the Second World War.

"Harry has previously said of his grandmother: ""She's my colonel-in-chief, right? She always will be"" The Queen was not asked by the Duke and Duchess of Sussex about naming their daughter Lilibet, a Palace source has told the BBC. The source disputed reports in the wake of the announcement of the name that Prince Harry and Meghan had spoken to the Queen before the birth. But a Sussexes' spokesperson insisted they would not have used the name had the Queen not been supportive. They said the monarch was the first family member the duke had called. The spokesperson said: ""The duke spoke with his family in advance of the announcement - in fact his grandmother was the first family member he called. ""During that conversation, he shared their hope of naming their daughter Lilibet in her honour. Had she not been supportive, they would not have used the name."" In a letter to some news broadcasters and publishers, the law firm Schillings, which acts for Prince Harry and Meghan, said the BBC report that the Queen was not asked for permission to use the name Lilibet was false and defamatory and should not be repeated. Lilibet has been the Queen's nickname among family since her childhood. 12 claims from Meghan's Oprah interview Harry: I want to break cycle of pain for my family Royal Family tree and line of succession The relationship between the couple and the Royal Family has made headlines in recent months. Earlier this year, while the couple were expecting their daughter, they aired criticisms of the Royal Family and made an allegation of racism inan explosive interview with Oprah Winfrey. And although Harry spoke about difficulties between him and his father, he said that he had a ""really good"" relationship with the Queen and they spoke regularly over video call. At the weekend,the couple announcedthat Lilibet ""Lili"" Diana Mountbatten-Windsor had been born at a hospital in Santa Barbara in California on Friday morning. The name ""Lilibet"" is heavy with personal history for Her Majesty. The nickname was coined when then-Princess Elizabeth was just a toddler and couldn't pronounce her own name properly. Her grandfather King George V would affectionately call her Lilibet, imitating her  attempts to say her name. It stuck and came to be used by close relatives. She signed her name as Lilibet on the funeral wreath for one of her closest friends Earl Mountbatten. The Queen's late husband, the Duke of Edinburgh, also called her by the nickname. The Queen, pictured here with her grandparents in 1932, was called Lilibet by her grandfather King George V Following Lilibet's birth, it was widely presumed that Harry and Meghan had first spoken to the Queen about the choice of name. There were subsequent stories in the press quoting ""friends"" of the couple who strongly suggested that Harry had sought permission from his grandmother. The Times also reported,externalthat it understood the Queen had been informed by Harry about the name. And a source close to the Sussexes also told the BBC that Harry had spoken to the Queen before the birth and ""would have mentioned the name"" - claims a Palace source has since disputed. The couple's first son, Archie, was born in the UK before they moved across the Atlantic Lilibet is the Queen's 11th great-grandchild and younger sister to Archie, who is now two years old. Her middle name, Diana, is a tribute to Prince Harry's late mother. Princess Charlotte, the daughter of Prince William and Catherine, also has Diana as one of her middle names, as well as Elizabeth. After her birth, Buckingham Palace said the Queen and other senior royals had been informed and were ""delighted with the news"". During the interview with Oprah in March, the couple said they would be done after baby number two - meaning they were not planning to have any more children.

"President Joe Biden has revoked an executive order from his predecessor Donald Trump banning Chinese apps TikTok and WeChat in the US. The ban faced a series of legal challenges and never came into force. Instead, the US Department of Commerce will now review apps designed and developed by those in ""the jurisdiction of a foreign adversary"", such as China. It should use an ""evidence-based approach"" to see if they pose a risk to US national security, Mr Biden said. TikTok did not offer comment on the news. Mr Trump ordered the banon new downloads of the viral video app TikTok, which is owned by Chinese firm Bytedance, in 2020. He described it at the time as a threat to national security. A proposal was produced that would have seen Oracle and Walmart owning a US entity of the service, and taking responsibility for handling TikTok's US user data and content moderation. But a series of legal challenges, and the fact Mr Trump was due to leave office shortly afterwards, meant neither the ban nor the involvement of the US companies ever came to fruition. In his new executive order,,externalPresident Biden said that the federal government should evaluate threats posed by China-based apps and software through ""rigorous, evidence-based analysis"", and should address ""any unacceptable or undue risks consistent with overall national security, foreign policy, and economic objectives"". He acknowledged that apps can ""access and capture vast swathes of information from users"". ""This data collection threatens to provide foreign adversaries with access to that information,"" he said. TikTok is used by about 80 million Americans every month. Ashley Gorski, a senior lawyer at the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), welcomed the decision to overturn the ban. ""President Biden is right to revoke these Trump administration executive orders, which blatantly violated the First Amendment rights of TikTok and WeChat users in the United States,"" she said. ""The Commerce Department's review of these and other apps must not take us down the same misguided path, by serving as a smokescreen for future bans or other unlawful actions."" Next week, President Biden is due to meet European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, and the two are expected to announce a partnership around technology and trade, in an attempt to push back on China's rise as a technology superpower. It is likely the partnership will include joint standards around emerging technologies, as well as commitments to take firmer action policing the internet, and to act on the critical supply chain issues that have arisen during the Covid pandemic.

"Joe's sister Alex says her brother suffered mood swings Joe began buying what he believed were genuine diazepam and Xanex pills from the internet to help with anxiety. But he became addicted to the fake pills - which he continued to believe were real - and earlier this year they almost killed him. Joe had struggled with shyness in his late teens and, like many, he found moving away to university a challenge. But when the 23-year-old returned home to rural mid Wales after his first year, mum Sarah was initially excited to see changes in him. ""I would say his personality had changed,"" said Sarah. ""He was much louder and almost like a little bit brash. Naively, I thought he'd just come out of his shell."" What Sarah didn't know was Joe - not their real names - had begun to self-medicate with what he believed were genuine diazepam and Xanax pills bought online in an effort to help with his anxiety. It wasn't long before his family noticed other changes in him too. Joe's mum found him after he had overdosed on fake prescription pills and suffered a cardiac arrest ""He'd go through phases of sleep walking, mood changes, very dilated pupils,"" said 25-year-old Alex, Joe's older sister. ""I asked him to talk to me as a sibling, I said I wouldn't say anything to mum and dad, but he never did."" How can I overcome my anxiety? 'Major concern' over online drug purchases Call for further improvement in mental health care When he returned to university for his second year, his mum began to get phone calls from him in the middle of the night. ""He said 'I've been using prescription drugs to try and help myself and I think it's getting out of control','"" said Sarah. ""I became aware he was buying them on the internet and that he was using them to address his mental health issues. He'd researched what he thought he needed to take - and in his mind he'd tackled the problem. ""But as things got worse I think he became very afraid that he was being overtaken by the addiction."" When he was at home normal-looking packages would arrive for him - inside were what he believed to be prescription drugs. He eventually showed his mum them, hoping to reassure her. Prescription drugs have to be prescribed by your GP but many people, like Joe, are going online to buy pills that they believe are legitimate to avoid consulting with a doctor. Joe's mum and sister had been getting worried about his sudden mood swings ""It was mostly diazepam,"" she said. ""It was in fully printed and marked packaging with batch numbers, dates and the information leaflet inside. ""To me they were the genuine drugs - and to Joe they were the genuine drugs. ""He used to say to me 'I know not to take too many, I know how many I should take, I'm in control, don't worry mum.' ""It didn't for one minute enter my mind that it wasn't what it said on the tin."" However the pills weren't what they claimed to be. Joe showed his mum the drugs he had bought online in an attempt to reassure her According to drugs testing lab Wedinos, between 45% to 65% of benzodiazepines sent in for testing, which include diazepam and Xanax, are actually fakes. These pills can use unregulated and much stronger ingredients, frequently leaving users with pills up to 10 times stronger than what they think they are taking. Joe had no idea the pills he was taking were fake. Earlier this year his mum went to wake him, only to find he had overdosed. ""I could see as soon as I approached the door that he was lying across his bed,"" recalled Sarah. ""The look of him, the feel of him, it just said to me 'he's dead, he's gone.' ""I just became hysterical. There was no-one in the house. I dialled the emergency services - and I couldn't speak - I was just shouting."" The paramedics battled to save Joe's life for hours. Eventually a decision was made to try to move him to hospital. According to a drugs testing lab about a half of benzodiazepines sent in for testing, which include diazepam and Xanax, are fakes. Sarah was told he could die on the way down the stairs, let alone the long journey to the nearest emergency department. Joe had suffered a cardiac arrest.

"This video can not be played Protecting trade flows east-west and north-south across the island of Ireland is ""easily doable"", says Boris Johnson The EU says its patience is ""wearing very thin"" with the UK in talks aimed at avoiding a post-Brexit trade war. Top EU official Maros Sefcovic said the UK must start checking goods entering Northern Ireland, as agreed in the 2019 Brexit ""divorce"" settlement. The UK says it is ready to ignore the rules to prevent further disruption - sparking threats of EU retaliation. Boris Johnson said a solution that protects trade flows and the peace process was ""easily doable"". And he dismissed talk of a trade war with the EU, saying he was ""not worried"" it would overshadow the G7 summit. The prime minister is in Cornwall, where he will host the leaders of the world's richest nations, including US President Joe Biden, who is said to have ""deep"" concerns that a UK-EU trade row could endanger peace in Northern Ireland. Why is there a UK-EU row over sausages? Don't imperil NI peace, Biden to warn UK and EU EU to begin legal action over NI Protocol 'breach' Asked about this, Mr Johnson said everyone needed to be ""absolutely clear"" that the purpose of the Northern Ireland protocol - the part of the Brexit deal at the centre of the row - was to ""uphold the Belfast Good Friday Agreement, to make sure that we keep the balance in relationships in Northern Ireland"". He said he was ""optimistic"" a solution could be found that ""protects the peace process, but also guarantees the economic and territorial integrity of the whole United Kingdom"". Lord Frost (L) has been discussing border issues with his EU counterpart Maros Sefcovic in central London Talks between Mr Sefcovic - a vice-president of the European Commission - and UK Brexit minister Lord Frost broke up earlier without agreement. Mr Sefcovic said he was ""positive we can find a solution"" but added: ""Our patience really is wearing very, very thin, and therefore we have to assess all options we have at our disposal."" This could include legal action, arbitration or retaliatory trade measures such as tariffs, he explained. He said ""trust"" had to be restored between the two sides, after the UK had broken the terms of the 2019 Northern Ireland protocol. A key flashpoint is a looming ban on the export of sausages and other chilled meats from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) no longer follows EU rules but Northern Ireland does - because it shares a land border with the Republic of Ireland, an EU member. EU food safety rules do not allow chilled meat products to enter its market from non-members like the UK. Frozen meat is not covered by the rules. In January, the two sides agreed a six month ""grace"" period to allow companies to set up alternative supply chains, but that runs out at the end of June. The UK has already held back from carrying out full checks on supermarket goods and parcels moving from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, prompting the EU to accuse the UK of undermining the protocol and tobegin legal proceedings. Mr Sefcovic said: ""If the UK were to take further unilateral action in the coming weeks the EU will not be shy in acting swiftly, firmly and resolutely to ensure the UK abides by its international obligations."" A UK source close to the negotiations said: ""Nobody wants to get into a trade war or anything close to it."" It was ""much better to find agreed ways forward"", added the source, and ""the people in Northern Ireland want solutions not threats"". ""But unfortunately we have got used to living in an atmosphere where there are threats."" Asked by ITV's Robert Peston if the UK would take unilateral action, Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis said ""we're not at that stage yet but we've said we will keep all options open."" There's a clash of cultures at the heart of this increasingly serious dispute. The EU is a union of laws and rules - and once it has an agreement it tends to stick to the details. The British government, on the other hand, decided to kick some of the details down the road in its desire to ""Get Brexit Done"". But those details never went away, and now they are threatening to provoke another crisis in Britain's relationship with Europe, and to destabilise Northern Ireland. During the 2019 general election campaign Boris Johnson said there would be no checks on goods moving in either direction between Great Britain and Northern Ireland as a result of his Brexit deal, even though official documents at the time made clear that there would be. Now his government says the EU needs to show more flexibility, that it's being too legalistic. The practicalities of implementing the Northern Ireland Protocol in full are certainly pretty challenging. Northern Ireland's chief vet recently told Assembly members in Belfast that it would require more checks on food than are done in the whole of the EU. And he only has 12 vets. The EU says it is prepared to be flexible, but says the UK cannot walk away from its legal obligations. Both sides talk about ""considering all our options"" if a compromise can't be found. In public at least, it's hard to see where the common ground lies. Mr Sefcovic said the EU had offered a temporary solution to the chilled meats row, ahead of a comprehensive trade deal, but he said the UK was not prepared to accept it because it would involve signing up to EU food standards. ""Ideology prevails over what is good for the people of Northern Ireland,"" he added. Northern Irish ports such as Larne have seen additional border checks under the protocol Speaking after his meeting with Mr Sefcovic, Lord Frost said the protocol was ""being implemented in a way which is causing disruption in Northern Ireland and we had some pretty frank and honest discussions about that situation"". ""There weren't any breakthroughs, there weren't any breakdowns either and we are going to carry on talking,"" he added. ""What we really now need to do is very urgently find some solutions, which support the Belfast Good Friday Agreement, Support the peace process in Northern Ireland and allow things to return to normal."" Government 'knew NI Protocol was bad deal' Can sea border âteething problemsâ be solved? Lord Frost said the EU was insisting that the two sides ""operate the protocol in an extremely purist way"" and he did not see any problem with continuing to allow exports of chilled meats. ""We don't see what risk is caused to Northern Ireland if chilled meats are imported there from GB."" Northern Ireland's deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill - who also took part in the meeting - challenged the UK government to ""honour its commitments"" on the Brexit protocol. ""Certainly there's a frustration that the British government have signed up to this agreement, however they have failed to bring forward ways to implement the Protocol in its entirety,"" she added.

"This video can not be played US President Joe Biden arrives in the UK ahead of the G7 summit US President Joe Biden's administration will provide 500 million doses of the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine to about 100 countries over the next two years, US media report. About 200 million doses will be distributed this year, with the remainder delivered in 2022. The US has been under pressure to raise vaccination rates in poor countries. The move comes as Mr Biden landed in the UK at the start of his first foreign trip as US president. The White House is yet to officially comment on the plan to roll out 500 million doses worldwide. But when asked if the US government had a vaccination strategy for the world, Mr Biden said: ""I have one, and I'll be announcing it,"" before boarding Air Force One. Awkward conversation looms for Biden and Putin Why are world leaders coming to the English seaside? An eager crowd awaited his arrival on Wednesdayat the RAF Mildenhall airbase in Suffolk, keen to catch a glimpse of Air Force One when Mr Biden touched down on Wednesday evening. Mr Biden addressed US troops stationed at the base, paying tribute to military families and remembering his late son, Beau, who served in the National Guard. He praised US allies - ""like-minded nations"" - and added: ""The United States is back!"" President Biden arrived with his wife Jill ""Democracies of the world are standing together to tackle the toughest challenges and the issues that matter most to our future,"" he said. Mr Biden later travelled on to Cornwall. The US president and Prime Minister Boris Johnson will meet for the first time on Thursday, ahead of the G7 summit in the south-western corner of England. Also in his eight-day trip Mr Biden will meet the Queen at Windsor Castle and join his first Nato summit as president. He has said the visit is about""America rallying the world's democracies"",external. The US president is due to meet his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, at the end of his travels in Europe. The US government will donate the vaccines to 92 lower-income countries and the African Union, Reuters news agency reports. Distribution will go through the Covax scheme, which was set up last year to try to ensure fair access to vaccines among rich and poor nations. What's the plan for rich countries to share spare vaccines? The US had previously said it would donate 60m vaccine doses through Covax. People familiar with the deal told the New York Times that the US would pay for the doses at a ""not-for-profit"" price. Albert Bourla, chief executive of Pfizer, is expected to appear with Mr Biden when he officially announces the initiative on Thursday. Earlier this week, Mr Johnson said he would urge G7 leaders to commit tovaccinating the world against Covid-19 by the end of next year. The UK and Canada have not yet said how many doses they will provide to the Covax scheme. The G7 (Group of Seven) is made up of the world's seven largest so-called advanced economies - Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK and the US - plus the EU. Why does the G7 summit matter? Other G7 leaders will arrive in Cornwall on Friday, and meetings will get under way the following morning. Tracy Williams (L) and family members were among those waiting for Air Force One outside RAF Mildenhall The main topic of conversation will be Covid recovery, including ""a stronger global health system that can protect us all from future pandemics,external"". The agenda also includes climate change and trade. Mr Biden is expected to warn that the ongoing UK-EU trade rowcould imperil peace in Northern Ireland. He will call on fellow leaders to protect the gains of the Good Friday agreement. At the end of the summit, the UK - as the host nation - will publish a document outlining what has been agreed by the leaders. The first US-Russia summit of the Biden presidency will take place in Geneva, Switzerland, on 16 June. It comes at the tail end of Mr Biden's trip, giving the president plenty of time to hear from US allies beforehand. The White House has indicated that he intends to cover a ""full range of pressing issues"" with his Russian counterpart, including arms control, climate change, Russian military involvement in Ukraine, Russia's cyber-hacking activities and the jailing of Russian dissident Alexei Navalny. Three organisations linked to Mr Navalny were outlawed by a Moscow court on Wednesday as ""extremist"". Mr Putin threw cold water on the Biden meeting last week, saying he hoped to improve the ""extremely low level of relations"" between the two countries but expected no breakthroughs. Russian dissident Alexei Navalny will be one of Mr Biden's topics when he meets Vladimir Putin Speaking in Suffolk on Wednesday evening, Mr Biden said that the US was not seeking conflict with Russia but wanted a stable, predictable relationship. ""I've been clear: the United States will respond in a robust and meaningful way if the Russian government engages in harmful activities."" He said he would tell Mr Putin there were consequences for ""violating the sovereignty of democracies in the United States, in Europe and elsewhere"". The transatlantic alliance (Nato) would remain a vital source of strength for the UK, Europe and the US, the president said. The White House said Mr Biden's meeting with Mr Johnson ahead of the summit would ""affirm the enduring strength"" of the countries' ""special relationship"". Both leaders took part in a virtual climate action summit hosted by the US in April but have not yet met in person. The president and First Lady Jill Biden will also be received by the Queen at Windsor Castle. It will be the 95-year-old monarch's first meeting with a foreign leader since the death of her husband Prince Philip. The next leg of Mr Biden's trip takes him to Brussels, where he will meet leaders of other Nato countries. US relations with Nato were strained under his predecessor Donald Trump, but Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg - in a White House visit on Monday - hailed Mr Biden's ""powerful commitment"" to US allies.

"The government has set out new post-Brexit trade arrangements between Northern Ireland, the rest of the UK and the European Union (EU). Northern Ireland's largest unionist party, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), refused to support earlier plans but has backed the new deal. Itclears the way for the Northern Ireland Assembly to meet again- two years after power-sharing collapsed. Trade between Northern Ireland, the rest of the UK and the Republic of Ireland was straightforward before Brexit - all parties were in the EU and shared the same trade rules. However, when the UK left the EU, a deal was required to allow trade to continue between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. The EU has strict food rules, and requires border checks when certain goods - such as milk and eggs - arrive from non-EU countries like the UK. Paperwork is also required for other goods. But the idea of checks at the Irish border is a sensitive issue because of Northern Ireland's political history. It was feared that introducing cameras or border posts as part of checks on incoming and outgoing goods could lead to instability. Post-Brexit controls on food and farm imports start What trade deals has the UK done since Brexit? The new dealagreed between the UK government and the DUP,external- called ""Safeguarding the Union"" - will reduce checks and paperwork on goods going from Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) to Northern Ireland. There will be no routine checks on British items being sold to consumers in Northern Ireland. However, some British products brought in for processing, such as raw materials and components, will still face full customs processes. DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said the deal meets his party's objectives. He said: ""We're no longer in a situation where if you bring goods in to sell in Northern Ireland, you need a customs declaration."" The UK government will also introduce two pieces of legislation, to guarantee Northern Irish goods can be sold in Great Britain in all circumstances, and to confirm Northern Ireland's place in the UK. A new body called Intertrade UK will work to boost trade between UK nations. At present, some online shoppers in Northern Ireland are told goods sold in the rest of the UK are not available for them to buy. What exactly is in the DUP deal? The first agreement with the EU, called the Northern Ireland Protocol, came into force on 1 January 2021. That introduced new checks on goods from Great Britain, at Northern Ireland's ports. The checks applied even if the goods were to remain in Northern Ireland. This angered unionists and led the DUP to boycott Northern Ireland's power-sharing administration at Stormont. The Windsor Framework was announced by Rishi Sunak and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen The protocol was amended by another agreement called the Windsor Framework, which wasadopted by the UK and EU in 2023. It created two ""lanes"" for goods arriving in Northern Ireland from Great Britain: Agreen lanefor goods remaining in Northern Ireland Ared lanefor goods which may be sent on to the EU Products going through the green lane do not need checks or additional paperwork. Red lane goods are still subject to checks. A ban on certain products - like chilled sausages - entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain was removed. And Northern Ireland no longer had to follow certain EU rules, for example on VAT and alcohol duties. The Windsor Framework also introduced a mechanism called the ""Stormont brake"",which would let the Northern Ireland Assembly object to new EU rules which would affect Northern Ireland's trade arrangements. That has not been tested yet because the assembly has not sat since the agreement was made. Despite the DUP's refusal to support the Windsor Framework,the system of green and red lines started operating on 1 October 2023. The BBC's NI economics and business editor John Campbell says the new deal maximises the flexibility allowed under the existing Windsor Framework, without changing its fundamental elements.

"Intensive talks are taking place on the NI Protocol which created a trade border in the Irish Sea The EU has warned the UK not to take any further unilateral action to delay post-Brexit checks on products entering Northern Ireland from Britain. The warning came from the European Commission's vice president. Maros Sefcovic said the EU ""will not be shy in reacting swiftly, firmly and resolutely to ensure that the UK abides by its international law obligations"". It comes as the two sides prepare to meet to assess possible simplifications of the Northern Ireland Protocol. The protocol is the part of the Brexit deal that created a trade border in the Irish Sea, in order to prevent goods checks along the Irish land border. Why is there a UK-EU row over sausages? The 2019 deal kept Northern Ireland in the EU single market for goods and means EU customs rules are now enforced at its ports. It was agreed that the checks would be phased in through the use of so-called""grace periods"". But earlier this year the UK unilaterally extended and enhanced some of these grace periods. TheEU started legal action as a result. The next phase of new controls, affecting chilled meat products like sausages and mince, are due to begin next month after the grace period overseeing them ends. By 1 July, the products will be prohibited from moving from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, or the grace period will be extended either by agreement or unilaterally by the UK. Inan article for the Daily Telegraph newspaper,external, Mr Sefcovic writes: 'If the UK takes further unilateral action over the coming weeks, the EU will not be shy in reacting swiftly, firmly and resolutely to ensure that the UK abides by its international law obligations."" The sausage and the chicken nugget have long enjoyed the right to roam around the UK; their legal passage from Great Britain to Northern Ireland assured. But this is due to end in a little over three weeks. The Brexit deal included an agreement that some products would be checked within the UK - when moved from Britain to Northern Ireland - as an alternative to a hard border with the Republic. And the movement of some goods, including chilled meats, would be banned, albeit after a grace period - that expires at the end of this month. The government regards the prospect of blocking the free movement of the sausage within the UK as ridiculous and has claimed the European Union is acting with what it called ""legal purism"". The EU is threatening to act ""swiftly, firmly and resolutely"" to ensure the UK abides by its ""obligations under international law"" as Brussels sees them. The British government agreed to the protocol in late 2019 but there have been some problems since it came into operation in January this year, and the UK is now seeking changes. George Eustice, the UK's Agriculture Minister, described the chilled meats issue as ""bonkers"" on Radio 4's Today programme on Tuesday. On Monday, the UK's Brexit Minister Lord Frost admitted the UK had ""underestimated"" the effect of the protocol on goods movements to Northern Ireland. In an article in the Financial Times,he accused the EU of ""legal purism""and called for ""pragmatic solutions between friends, not the imposition of one side's rules on the other"". However, in his Daily Telegraph article on Tuesday, Mr Sefcovic denied that the EU had been intransigent over the protocol. ""Far from being inflexible, the EU has shown from the very beginning that we are willing to find creative solutions when required,"" the European Commission vice president wrote. Maros Sefcovic said the EU would react swiftly, firmly and resolutely to any UK unilateral changes to the protocol ""The continued availability of medicines to Northern Ireland is among those tailor-made flexible solutions - something I personally take very seriously in this time of pandemic."" Mr Sefcovic added that the EU team was ""working hard to find ways to ensure that the protocol is implemented in a way that both facilitates the everyday life of Northern Ireland's communities and preserves the integrity of the EU's Single Market"". He stressed the need for UK-EU cooperation to implement the existing 2019 deal, saying ""we should not waste time turning the tables and washing our hands of an agreement that we shaped, agreed and signed jointly"". The EU-UK Joint Committee is due to meet in London on Wednesday to review progress on technical talks that have been examining ways to simplify the Northern Ireland Protocol. Officials have been holding intensive talks, but there is little expectation of a major breakthrough at the meeting. It is understood UK officials believe there has been significant progress in only two of about 30 problem areas and each side has accused the other of a lack of real engagement However, the EU is preparing to offer a number of concessions, that would include: Ensuring ""uninterrupted supply"" for medicines destined for Northern Ireland that have been authorised by the UK Flexibility on steel quotas and tariffs which have affected Northern Ireland in a way that was ""not anticipated in the protocol"" A pet passport exemption for guide dogs entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain An easing of livestock rules to avoid ""multiple tagging"" But an EU official said the EU's patience with the UK was ""wearing thin"" and warned that there could be trade sanctions if there is no breakthrough on implementing the protocol by next month. Ahead of Wednesday's meeting, Northern Ireland business groups urged the UK and EU to find ""immediate solutions"" to Irish Sea border trading problems. ""We cannot afford another missed opportunity at the joint committee,"" said the Northern Ireland Business Brexit Working Group - a coalition of organisations and companies. ""We continue to hear that the EU and UK are committed to their assertion in the preamble to the protocol that they are 'determined that the application of this protocol should impact as little as possible on the everyday life of communities in both Ireland and Northern Ireland'. ""But it undoubtedly is having an impact and will increasingly do so as more stringent requirements come in from October."" Customs checks are carried out at ports in Northern Ireland as a result of the new trade rules It added: ""We are heartened by the increased level of engagement that we have had in the past few weeks and months, however, we need to see that our faith in this process is justified by the delivery of solutions."" The working group added that there will be opportunities under the protocol, given the access it gives to both the UK and EU markets, but trade frictions need to be removed for the economy as a whole. Government 'knew NI Protocol was bad deal' Can sea border âteething problemsâ be solved? Meanwhile, the Northern Ireland trade union representative body, NIC ICTU, said ""a space has to be created that acknowledges the practical problems with the protocol while also respecting the integrity of EU single market"". It added that it is ""not acceptable or credible that those who demanded a hard Brexit now say the 'protocol must go!' This simplistic rhetoric misleads and abuses the electorate and encourages division."" But it said: ""The concerns of many within the unionist community around the practical issues with the protocol need to be respected, considered and addressed.""

"Joe Biden has ""deep"" concerns that a UK-EU trade row could endanger peace in Northern Ireland, his national security adviser has told the BBC. The US president will tell fellow leaders at this week's G7 summit that gains since the Good Friday Agreement must be protected, Jake Sullivan said. The UK and EU are at loggerheads over checks on goods going between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. If no compromise is reached, there are fears of potential violence in NI. Mr Sullivan's comments also come as the UK is trying to secure a free-trade deal with the US. He insisted he was not trying to ""negotiate in public"" or issue a ""warning"" to Boris Johnson's government, but merely stating ""how the president feels about this issue"". UK and EU urge compromises over Irish Sea border Why is there a UK-EU row over sausages? Thousands of extra police arrive ahead of G7 The UK and EU are in talks over simplifying the Northern Ireland Protocol, which set up a post-Brexit trade border between Northern Ireland and Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) in order to prevent goods checks along the Irish land border. Some checks are taking place on British goods going to Northern Ireland, causing some disruption to food supplies and online deliveries. Unionists are strongly opposed to these because they do not want Northern Ireland to be treated differently to the rest of the UK. Sinn FÃ©in, the SDLP, and Alliance have said there are problems with the protocol but have argued that the UK and EU must ensure its ""rigorous implementation"". One loyalist group haswritten to Mr Johnsonto withdraw support for the Good Friday Agreement - signed in 1998 following heavy involvement by the US - which helped bring an end to the Troubles. This video can not be played Biden adviser Jake Sullivan says the gains of the Good Friday Agreement must be protected In an interview with BBC North America editor Jon Sopel, Mr Sullivan said the success or failure of the Northern Ireland Protocol was ""critical to ensuring that the spirit, promise and future of the Good Friday Agreement is protected"". He urged the UK and EU to ""work out the specifics"" and ""find a way to proceed that works for both"", adding: ""But whatever way they find to proceed must at its core fundamentally protect the gains of the Good Friday Agreement and not imperil that."" That was the ""message President Biden will send"" at the G7 summit, which runs from Friday to Sunday in Carbis Bay, Cornwall, Mr Sullivan said. The conflict in Northern Ireland known as the Troubles lasted almost 30 years from the late 1960s, and cost the lives of more than 3,500 people. Northern Ireland was createdin 1921 and remained part of the UK, while the rest of Ireland became an independent state. This created a split in the population between the unionists - who were mainly Protestants and were happy to stay in the UK - and nationalists, who were predominantly Catholics and wanted to join the new Irish state. Many Catholics faced discrimination in jobs and housing and in the late 1960s began protests which were met with a crackdown from the Northern Ireland government. In 1969, after violence across Northern Ireland, the UK government deployed troops to restore public order. They were largely welcomed, but later armed groups from both sides, like the Irish Republican Army (IRA) and Ulster Defence Association (UDA), began carrying out bombings and shootings. Peace talks started in the early 1990s, and culminated in the signing of theGood Friday Agreementin 1998, which ended the worst of the violence. Issues including climate change and post-pandemic recovery are set to dominate the meeting of leaders of most of the world's biggest economies. The G7 summit also comes as the UK is keen to reach free-trade deals with other countries, including the US, as it readjusts its economy following Brexit. ""I'm not intending to send any warnings,"" Mr Sullivan said. But he added: ""Our concern [on Northern Ireland] does run deep. That is simply a statement of principle. That's how the president feels about this issue. ""What it does to a US-UK free-trade agreement, I don't want to sit here and negotiate in public... or make some claim or threat,"" Mr Sullivan said. ""We want to make sure that the work that the US, UK, and Ireland have all done, in addition to the key parties in NI, has got to be honoured and respected and protected as we go forward,"" he added. A senior UK government source said the government was ""positive"" about President Biden's engagement with Northern Ireland and the peace process, saying: ""We welcome the balanced tone from the US."" Jake Sullivan was very keen to impress upon me that, if the administration were a rock-'n'-roll band, this would be the ""America is back"" tour. He wants the world to know that the isolationist, poke-your-allies-in-the-eye Trump years are gone, that the familiar, multilateral America is returning. Mr Sullivan argues that on climate change, the global economy and leading the world out of the pandemic, the US will play a leading role. This will be welcomed by the other G7 nations after the bumpiness that came with his predecessor. But Mr Sullivan is aware that will be met with some scepticism too. After the scarring events of 6 January, when Washington's Capitol building was stormed, how can America be the role model of functioning liberal democracy? How reliable a partner will it be? Could the go-it-alone America re-emerge in four years' time? The UK has pushed back the full implementation of checks on supermarket goods and parcels travelling from Britain to Northern Ireland to ease disruption to supplies. This has prompted the EU to accuse the UK of undermining the Northern Ireland Protocol and begin legal action. The next phase of controls, on chilled meat products including sausages and mince, is due to begin on 1 July. The UK's Brexit minister, Lord Frost, is meeting his EU counterpart Maros Sefcovic in London to discuss ways to reduce trade disruption. He has urged the EU to show ""common sense"", but Mr Sefcovic has warned against ""quick fixes"" to border issues.

"Do summits like this matter? ""Occasionally!"" comes the answer from a former government insider who worked for years at the very top. They warn that global get-togethers - however glamorous the location, however acute any particular political emergency, however good the freebies for the thousands of attendees - can descend into 'waffelage'. As the most powerful elected people in the world prepare to occupy a tiny Cornish bay for a few days, will this be an occasion that makes a difference to any of our lives or will it be waffle in the end? A senior diplomat closely involved in the preparation is confident, ""this will be very meaningful."" It is the first time the new American president will have met the relatively new British prime minister in person - a big moment by any measure. And it's the first time that the leaders of the world's biggest democracies have gathered like this since their countries were hit by a genuine emergency - Covid. Thousands of extra police arrive ahead of G7 Why are world leaders coming to the English seaside? Don't imperil NI peace, Biden to warn UK and EU This current cast of leaders, particularly with a new boss in the White House, has given the impression in the run up to this meeting that they want genuinely to work together as the pandemic, while still with us, begins to fade. The next few days will show whether they really mean it or not. Even in the age of video calls and instant messages pinging their way around the world, summits do matter, because leaders and their officials can talk face to face. Real business can get done during ""the hallway conversations, the drinks at the bar"", the diplomat says. Huge public attention puts the pressure on, and the moment where they all wave goodbye and climb back into their limos or helicopters provides a deadline to decide. Without doubt, real life contact makes a difference to what is decided. One former senior figure in Theresa May's administration recalls a moment of jeopardy at a summit with President Trump. He was planning to leave early, without signing up to the form of words that the other nations wanted. The former official told me he was ushered into what was described as a ""secure broom cupboard"" with the then Australian leader, Malcolm Turnbull and the French President, Emmanuel Macron. It's said they remained locked in argument in the tiny room, until Mr Trump agreed. The traditional G7 ""family photo"" taken in Canada, 2018 At a different G7 meeting in 2018, again the other nations were struggling to get Mr Trump and his officials to agree on the principles the others wanted to publish. The dispute was over if and how the final document would refer to the ""international rules based order"" - the loose jargon for how democracies agree to behave and work with each other through shared institutions like the UN. Without a specific definition of what the ""rules based order"" really meant though, the US was reluctant. So a small group of leaders themselves and a few key officials haggled face-to-face with the president and his powerful adviser, John Bolton, outside the formal meetings to do a deal. The compromise was that the document would refer to ""a"" rules based order, not ""the"" when referring to the ""international rules based order"". At a summit, leaders of the free world, and a few of their close aides, spent precious time arguing over the use of the definite or indefinite article... And some of the broader tensions during that meeting were captured in a classic photograph. Summits are the product of months and months of work by the hosts, and are carefully planned to within an inch of their lives and are huge opportunities for countries to show off. Covering the meetings over the years I've witnessed astonishing firework displays in China, the Argentine first lady hosting an elaborate tea party for leaders' spouses where even the air kissing seemed to be choreographed, parades, concerts, and plenty of the events themselves that are designed to show the leaders' interactions to the world. Summits have their own language too - the 'family photos' - the moments where the leaders have to take pre-appointed places for official snaps to be taken. The 'bilats' or 'trilats' - one-to-one, or one-to-two meetings where the bond, or lack of, between the politicians is so blindingly obvious. The 'communique' - the final document that leaders sign up to that's published at the end; prepared for months in advance by the 'sherpas', senior officials for each country, but the final version agreed only by the leaders themselves at the last minute. But when the most senior politicians in the world and their most senior staff are in essence locked down together for a few days it is those unscripted moments that stick in the mind. Bumping into a European prime minister who was wandering around a corridor in Brussels, who seemed lost, but said yes to an interview then and there in the dingy basement, filmed on a phone - that made the news. One very early morning in a hot, foreign clime when trying to get some sea air to wake up after only a couple of hours of sleep, I encountered a very prominent official on the beach who rather mysteriously had company at that time of day. One of their colleagues, seconds later, came leaping out of the sea having been confronted by some jellyfish - ending the need for a longer, awkward conversation. When a tense European summit dragged on with David Cameron, while we hacks were still hanging around inside waiting for news, the German Chancellor Angela Merkel had had enough and popped out with her team for chips. And at the prime minister's own first summit in charge in Biarritz he went for his own swim off the French Atlantic coast. Of course, Boris Johnson being Boris Johnson, he didn't keep it to himself, but in classic style he used his swim out to a large rock as a metaphor for supporters for his hoped for heroics on Brexit. One diplomat expressed concern at the notion of the leaders taking a dip this time round worrying about the all important 'optics'. The summit will be Mrs Johnson's first official public engagement since her wedding to the prime minister. But alongside the very serious hoped for progress on vaccines, on Covid recovery, on the climate, on reaffirming the links between the most powerful democracies in the world after the Trump Presidency, the events that have not been planned might be the ones that stay in the mind. The next few days will also see the first official public engagements of the new Mrs Carrie Johnson. Like it or not, always nicknamed the ""leaders' wives"" summit, the ""spousal programme"" as it's officially termed is a universe all of its own. This time, without question, this G7 should be an occasion that matters, for the serious discussions that are due to take place. The government hopes for strong confirmation of the relationship between the UK and the US, commitments to help get vaccines to the developing world, and for progress on climate change. They plan also for convincing conversations with the other nations that have been invited, what the prime minister is terming the ""football team"" - the ""D 11"" - the G7 plus India (attending virtually), South Korea, South Africa and Australia too, forging links ever more important among democracies in the face of growing influence from China. But this summit will also matter for the glimpses of our leaders, and snapshots of the vital relationships they forge.

"The UK government faces a difficult choice in the next few days. Many people are desperate to see the return to normality promised by the final stage of the roadmap to lifting lockdown. But ministers always said 21 June was not set in stone - and could be affected by changes in the pandemic, including the emergence of new variants. What will they be weighing up as they make their final decision? Here are four key numbers to watch out for in the coming days. There are just under 1,000 people with coronavirus in hospitals in the UK, up about 5% from a low point a week ago. That's far below the peak of nearly 40,000 people in January. And NHS Providers say the people who are going in aren't as seriously ill as they were in early waves. They are younger, or don't require intensive care as much - and they're coming out sooner. That means this wave is different, and better, than previous ones but eventually rising admissions will mount up. In the two parts of the UK that are furthest into this ""third wave"", the North West of England and Scotland, the number of people in hospital with coronavirus is rising faster than the rest of the UK. How far and how fast this trend develops depends on how fast infections are rising and how likely you are to get seriously sick with the new variant. Health Secretary Matt Hancock told Parliament on Tuesday that the main type of coronavirus in the UK - the Delta variant first identified in India - is ""at least 40%"" more transmissible than the version that sparked the winter wave - the Alpha variant first seen in Kent. And as Delta takes over, infections are on the rise again. Last week, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) suggested thatUK infections had risen by 60% in a single week. If that growth rate remains steady or picks up, it suggests that cases will rise pretty quickly if and when society reopens further. We'll learn more on Friday. But rising infections on their own aren't a reason to extend lockdown. The government'skey test,externalis whether rising infections ""risk a surge in hospitalisations which would put unsustainable pressure on the NHS"". And that also depends on your chances of getting seriously ill if you catch coronavirus. When could social distancing end? That is much harder to predict now than it was in the first or second waves, when scientists could predict what proportion of cases would need treatment. That's because vaccines do reduce your chance of getting really sick if you do get infected with any variant. Already we can see thatwhile people who have been double jabbed make up more than 40% of the population, they make up fewer than 5% of people who have been admitted to hospitalwith the Delta variant. But it does look like it takes two doses before someone gets high levels of protection from that variant. So there's a race on: double-jab as many people as possible, before the virus spreads enough to find the vulnerable or to put pressure on the NHS. More than 50% of adults have been given the best protection possible - two doses of the vaccine. That's still a way off herd immunity, even if you add in people who have some immunity from having had coronavirus in the past. Say each infected person would, on average, pass the virus on to six other people in a fully open society that hadn't seen the virus before. Then five out of six people, not just five out of six adults, would need to be able to fight off the virus - that would be the ""herd immunity threshold"". We're not there yet, and it's possible that the threshold is higher as Delta could be more infectious than imagined in this example. But every person vaccinated helps to slow the spread. How many people have been vaccinated so far? To predict what rising infections will mean for the NHS, you need to know how fast cases will rise and how many cases will get really sick. We don't know either figure precisely, and probably won't by 14 June. And a rough estimate doesn't help. The last time UK government modellers made their forecasts, the difference between ""40% more transmissible"" (the orange line below) and ""50% more transmissible"" (the blue line below) made a huge difference to the predicted severity of a third wave. And then, to know what to do about rising cases, you need to predict what effect any change to the rules might have on spread. It's uncertainty piled on uncertainty. To know the cost of that action, you need to know what effect another few weeks of being shut, or trading at a loss, would do to the businesses that are desperate to open up. It's a mammoth task and one that will require some old-fashioned political judgement as well as hi-tech epidemiological models. LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area?

"Joe Biden has ""deep"" concerns that a UK-EU trade row could endanger peace in Northern Ireland, his national security adviser has told the BBC. The US president will tell fellow leaders at this week's G7 summit that gains since the Good Friday Agreement must be protected, Jake Sullivan said. The UK and EU are at loggerheads over checks on goods going between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. If no compromise is reached, there are fears of potential violence in NI. Mr Sullivan's comments also come as the UK is trying to secure a free-trade deal with the US. He insisted he was not trying to ""negotiate in public"" or issue a ""warning"" to Boris Johnson's government, but merely stating ""how the president feels about this issue"". UK and EU urge compromises over Irish Sea border Why is there a UK-EU row over sausages? Thousands of extra police arrive ahead of G7 The UK and EU are in talks over simplifying the Northern Ireland Protocol, which set up a post-Brexit trade border between Northern Ireland and Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) in order to prevent goods checks along the Irish land border. Some checks are taking place on British goods going to Northern Ireland, causing some disruption to food supplies and online deliveries. Unionists are strongly opposed to these because they do not want Northern Ireland to be treated differently to the rest of the UK. Sinn FÃ©in, the SDLP, and Alliance have said there are problems with the protocol but have argued that the UK and EU must ensure its ""rigorous implementation"". One loyalist group haswritten to Mr Johnsonto withdraw support for the Good Friday Agreement - signed in 1998 following heavy involvement by the US - which helped bring an end to the Troubles.

"The Halo Trust workers were shot ""in cold blood"" Masked gunmen have shot dead 10 mine clearers working for the Halo Trust in Afghanistan's northern province of Baghlan, and wounded more than a dozen. The workers were killed when gunmen burst into their compound at 21:50 (17:20 GMT) on Tuesday, after they had spent a day removing mines from a nearby field. The Islamic State group (IS) said it had carried out the attack. Afghan officials had blamed the Taliban, who denied involvement. Halo Trust CEO James Cowan told the BBC that the local Taliban had, on the contrary, helped in the aftermath. IS made the claim in a statement via its channels on the messaging app Telegram. Violence has surged in Afghanistan since the US began to withdraw its last troops on 1 May. The departure of international troops comes amid a deadlock in peace talks between the Afghan government and the Taliban. Rapid relocation planned for Afghan interpreters How can the West fight terror after leaving Afghanistan? Have things got better in Afghanistan? Mr Cowan of the Halo Trust told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the attackers had gone ""bed to bed"" shooting the workers ""in cold blood"" - but that the local Taliban had helped the deminers. ""I think it's important to know that the Taliban have denied responsibility for this, and indeed the local Taliban group came to our aid and scared the assailants off,"" he said. ""I think we have the capacity as the Halo Trust to operate on both sides of the line in this awful conflict,"" he added. Mr Cowan later told the BBC Afghan service that the attackers had specifically targeted members of the Hazara ethnic minority group. Hazaras, Afghanistan's third-largest ethnic group, have faced long-term discrimination and persecution, primarily because of their Shia Muslim faith. In recent years, they have faced abductions and killings at the hands of IS and the Taliban, which are both Sunni Muslim. 'IS wants to wipe us out' - Afghan Shias in the firing line ""A group of armed men came to our camp and sought out members of the Hazara community, and then murdered them,"" Mr Cowan said. ""This was not expected. The broader security situation [in Afghanistan] is understood, but this kind of cold-blooded killing was not expected."" After an interior ministry spokesman told reporters that the Taliban had carried out the attack, the militant group's spokesman, Zabihullah Mujahid, tweeted that it condemned attacks on the defenceless. ""We have normal relations with NGOs [non-governmental organisations]. Our Mujahideen will never carry out such brutal attacks,"" he said. Several districts in Baghlan province have seen fierce fighting between the Taliban and government forces. Analysis by Inayatulhaq Yasini, BBC Kabul bureau editor Halo Trust and other demining organisations have been working in Afghanistan for more than three decades, freely moving even near frontlines, a fact I have seen for myself. Halo Trust has 3,000 staff in Afghanistan. Warring factions have been helpful to deminers in the past - however it has been rare for the Taliban or other groups to come forward to help victims of an attack. Halo Trust mostly hires local people, which also creates jobs for local communities. The organisation's CEO, James Cowan, told the BBC the attackers had ""fled to an area which is not controlled by the Taliban"". The province of Baghlan where the attack happened has been the scene of fighting between the government and the Taliban for weeks. Anyone can exploit a situation where different local militias and warlords are also active in the province. The aim of the attack is clear: to incite ethnic tension among Afghans, where 40 years of war has already widely affected unity in the country. In a clip police in Baghlan shared with reporters, a survivor of the attack also said the gunmen had asked if any of them were from the Hazara minority community before opening fire. ""Five to six armed men came, they took us to a room,"" he said. ""First they took all our money and mobile phones, and then they asked who our leader was. They asked, 'Is any Hazara here among you?' We told them, 'We don't have any Hazara here.'"" He added that he had been shot in the head, but managed to escape through a window. The UK-based Halo Trust was founded in 1988 to remove ordnance left behind from the almost decade-long Soviet occupation of Afghanistan. It was supported by Princess Diana, as well as by her son Prince Harry.

Here's a round-up of the main headlines today: This video can not be played Free Hugs: Does Covid mean the end of hugging strangers? The Covid pandemic put a stop to the Free Hugs movement - with social distancing guidelines and restrictions in place in countries around the world. The group used to offer hugs to strangers every weekend - but they say any decision to relax social distancing should be treated with caution. BBC health reporter, Laura Foster, spoke to some members of Free Hugs UK about the importance of hugs and when they might be able to freely hug again. The Penta Hotel in Reading's Oxford Rd opened as a quarantine facility on 29 April A local council has called on the government to shut a quarantine hotel in Reading after a total of 44 positive cases of Covid-19 were identified among residents and staff. Reading Council says it is ""unconvinced"" the outbreak is under control or that robust safety measures are in place. The quarantine facility, run by the Department of Health and Social Care, opened on 29 April. Reading Borough Council says it was notified of the first Covid outbreak on 9 May. The local authority says cases have spread ""between guests, and hotel and security staff"". It says it believes at least three cases in the community have been directly linked to the hotel's outbreak and the spread ""could have been avoided had the correct safety procedures been in place"" at the outset. The majority of the positive cases have been identified as the Delta variant. The Department for Health and Social Care has been approached for comment. Prime Minister Boris Johnson says itâs
too early to say if England's lockdown can end on 21 June as data on whether
the vaccine rollout offers enough protection from the Delta variant is still being assessed. ""On Monday... we'll have a look
at where we are. I think what everybody can see very clearly is that cases are
going up, and in some places hospitalisations are going up,"" he says, speaking in Cornwall ahead of the G7 conference. ""What we need to assess is the
extent to which the vaccine rollout - which has been phenomenal - has built up
protection in the population in order for us to go ahead to the next stage. And
so that's what we'll be looking at."" As we reported earlier, the UK has recorded another 7,540 coronavirus cases over the past 24 hours - the highest number of daily cases reported since the end of February. Cases have risen dramatically over the past week, with a seven-day average of 5,984 - as the Delta variant continues to make its presence felt. But the number of cases is still far off the peak in January - and daily deaths remain low: on Wednesday, data showed a further six deaths within 28 days of a positive test - compared with 12 deaths a week ago. Scientists attribute the fall in both hospitalisations and deaths to the success of the vaccine rollout. More than half the adult population - 54.2% - are now fully vaccinated, while 77.3% have had one jab.   High school pupils in Scotland retuned to face-to-face lessons after the Easter holidays The number of Covid infections recorded among children in Scotland is now at the highest level it has been since the start of the outbreak. Weekly infections among children aged up to 14 reached 1,064 on 7 June - higher than the peak in early January, according to Public Health Scotland. While there is no evidence children are becoming seriously ill - with no significant rise in hospital admissions - growing numbers of pupils are off school. Provisional figures indicate 15,687 pupils were absent for Covid-related reasons at the end of last week, with overall attendance dropping to 87.8%. Data shows a four-fold increase in cases among children under 15, but infection rates are still considerably higher among young adults and older teenagers. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said Scotland will move quickly to vaccinate 12-15 year olds if recommended by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation. Read the full story. A number of government reviews are currently under way looking at Covid-19 measures in England. Their findings will inform wider policy forstep four of the roadmap plan,external- which will happen on 21 June at the earliest, butcould be delayed past then. What
reviews are there?  Find out morehere. Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics The number of people in
hospital with coronavirus is on the rise again and reached 1,024 on Monday 7 June,
rising above 1,000 for the first time since mid-May. Back then, numbers were
falling and they reached a low point of just under 870 on 27 May. But they have risen by nearly
20% in the 11 days since then. This is still far below the
peak in Januaryâs wave when nearly 40,000 people were in hospital with
coronavirus in the UK. And people in the NHS say the cases theyâre seeing now are less serious than in previous waves. But they underline the inevitable
impact of the rising case numbers that we have been seeing in the UK. The rises in people in
hospital are driven by increasing numbers of people in hospital in Scotland and
the North West of England, the region and nation where cases have been rising
for the longest in the UK in the early stages of this third wave. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Traffic control measures have been imposed in parts of Guangzhou in an attempt to limit the spread of the virus In the past 24
hours, China has confirmed eight new domestic symptomatic cases of Covid-19,
all in southern Guangdong province. This is the
only area of mainland China where there is currently an outbreak; 164 people
are currently in hospital across the province. Most patients are in the
populous city of Guangzhou, which along with the nearby city of Foshan and
Wuchuan County, has local lockdowns in place. Guangzhou is
one of Chinaâs biggest cities, and as cases of mutant variants have been
detected, there have been some fears that it could see a large-scale outbreak,
like those seen in the cities ofWuhanorShijiazhuang. However, huge
vaccine uptake has helped China avoid a third wave â more than 800 million
vaccine doses have now been administeredacross the country,externaland recent media reports have suggested new patients have exhibited mild or no
symptoms. Even with
triple-digit cases, tens of thousands of students have still been able to sit
their university entrance exams in Guangzhou this week. This would have been
unthinkable during earlier outbreaks â Chinaâs approach to date has been to
swiftly lock down communities and order mass testing drives, allowing people
very little room for manoeuvre. But vaccination uptake has helped China relax
its Covid-19 regulations. Local governments have been increasingly finding safe
ways for events to go ahead, rather than simply cancelling them. It is still
not clear how this latest outbreak began. Health officials in Guangzhou say the genetic sequencing of cases in the city show a 98% similarity,
suggesting they are all linked to the same chain of transmission. A local
health commission official tells the official CCTV broadcasterâmore investigation is needed to identify patient zeroâ,external. Philippa RoxbyHealth reporter, BBC News There are still many unknowns about the Delta variant, first
detected in India, which is causing a worrying rise in cases and hospital
admissions in some areas of the UK. Overall, the virus is still at low levels â but there is now
clear concern from scientists that a third wave could be on its way. Prof Neil Ferguson, virus modeller from Imperial College
London, tells journalists the size and scale of that wave depends on how
effective the vaccines are at protecting against illness from the Delta
variant. That still isnât clear and more data needs to be collected. The Delta variant could be anywhere from 40-80% more
transmissible, he says, with 60% his âbest estimateâ. âBut thereâs still an enormous amount of uncertainty,â he
adds. In the meantime, administering as many second doses as
quickly as possible is a priority - to give people the best possible protection. As for easing final restrictions on 21 June, there is
caution from Prof Ferguson. Delaying unlocking, he says, would allow more people to be
vaccinated - and reduce the size of a third wave. But the final say rests with
the government.  Vaccines
should be prioritised for high-risk areas where there are a large number of cases
of the Delta variant, say a group of MPs and council leaders from north-west England. In a letter
to the prime minister, the group - which includes Blackburn MP Kate Hollern and
leader of Manchester City Council Sir Richard Leese - say the challenges
posed by the Delta variant are different to those faced by the country a few
months ago. Greater Manchester and Lancashire accounts for 90% of the areas with the highest infection rates in England, according to last week's data. The local leaders say with the vast majority of the most vulnerable fully vaccinated,
the âfocus should now shiftâ to areas where the likelihood of contracting the
Delta variant is greatest. The
letter calls on the government to ensure vaccines are making their way to
areas âthat need them mostâ, adding: âDoing so would not only benefit our local areas, but the national effort to contain
the spread of the Delta variant.â Around three million text messages are being sent out over this week to ask 25 to 29-year-olds to book their coronavirus vaccine through the national booking service. GPs are also set to urge the newly-eligible groups to come forward over the coming days. Text invitations, which do not expire, should appear as an alert from ""NHSvaccine"" and include a web link to the NHS website to reserve an appointment. When invited, people will be able to book at one of the 1,600 vaccination centres, pharmacies or GP sites across the country that are available through the national booking service. Vaccination centres are also popping up in places such as mosques, museums and sports stadiums. Who can book the vaccine now? Find out here. The UKâs latest
figures also show the number of people to have had one vaccine dose is now
40.7 million, while the number who have received both doses is 28.5 million. That's 77.3%
of the adult population who have had one jab, and 54.2% who have had two jabs. The UK
has recorded another 7,540 coronavirus cases,according to the latest government figures.,external That is
the highest number of daily cases reported since 26 February. The
seven-day average for cases is up by 66%, amid concerns the Delta variant is
fuelling a rise in infections. There
have also been a further six deaths within 28 days of a positive test. Today's figures compare with 4,330 cases a week ago and 12 deaths. We've got more now on the record day for vaccination bookings. When vaccine appointments opened to 25 to 29-year-olds yesterday the initial surge prompted 100,000 bookings an hour between 07:00 BST and midday, according to NHS figures. NHS chief executive Sir Simon Stevens labels it a ""Glastonbury-style"" rush for jabs - a reference to the traditional stampede to book tickets for the music festival. He says: ""The obvious enthusiasm of younger adults to get their jab has blown out of the water the suggestion that people in their 20s might not come forward to protect themselves and their loved ones."" Hitting one million bookings in a day ""sends a fantastic signal"", says Dr Emily Lawson, lead for the NHS Covid Vaccination Programme. She says it shows ""the Covid-19 vaccine is something that all of us - no matter our age â can value and be excited by and most importantly should get, when our opportunity comes."" Coronavirus vaccine bookings on the NHS website reached a record high of more than one million yesterday. It's first time daily appointments made through the national booking service have topped the million mark. As vaccines were opened up to people aged 25 to 29 yesterday morning, a total of 1,082,596 first and second dose slots were snapped up across the day online and by phone. That's about 45,000 an hour on average and more than 750 every minute, over the full 24 hours. The daily total for the National Booking Service yesterday means around four times as many slots were booked yesterday compared with the day before and the same day last week. Covid-19 testing in Northern Ireland's post-primary schools is to be extended to all pupils from this week until the end of the summer term. Previously, lateral flow device (LFD) testshad been made available to older students in years 12 to 14 onlywhere prevalence of Covid-19 tends to be higher. But for the final fortnight of term, the twice-weekly tests will be expanded to cover years eight to 11 - encompassing pupils aged 12 and upwards. NI Education Minister Peter Weir is urging schools ""to make use of their stock of LFD kits to extend the offer to all pupils in Years 8-11 for the remaining weeks of term"". ""The purpose of asymptomatic testing is to find individuals who are infected but do not realise it."" he explains. ""They can then be advised to isolate so reducing the risk of them unwittingly spreading infection in the school and elsewhere."" Read the full story. The chairs of two parliamentary select committees have written to Dominic Cummings asking him to provide documentary evidence for âseveral serious allegationsâ he made last month. In the letter, sent last week, Greg Clark and Jeremy Hunt asked for evidence for the claims Cummings made about Health Secretary Matt Hancockâs honesty. In addition, Cummings has been asked to provide text exchanges he had with the prime minister, as well as numerous ministers, officials and journalists. The pair had asked for the evidence to be provided by 4 June to allow it to be studied by their joint inquiry on coronavirus, ahead of Hancockâs appearance tomorrow. But âno evidence has been received to date from Dominic Cummingsâ by the Committee. While older people have been the most at risk from coronavirus itself, the young have disproportionately suffered from its economic fallout, according to unemployment figures. The unemployment rate among young people was 14.6% in 2020 but 5.2% for over 25s, according to the International Labour Organization (ILO). ""The young jobless have been stuck in a Covid-19 limbo-land,"" says Sher Verick, from ILO. ""This crisis has...not only led to the closure of businesses and job losses, but the lockdown measures have also severely constrained young people's ability to search for a job,"" he says. The data shows young women have generally suffered more from the economic consequences of Covid than young men and you can find out morehere. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Joe Biden has ""deep"" concerns that a UK-EU trade row could endanger peace in Northern Ireland, his national security adviser has told the BBC. The US president will tell fellow leaders at this week's G7 summit that gains since the Good Friday Agreement must be protected, Jake Sullivan said. The UK and EU are at loggerheads over checks on goods going between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. If no compromise is reached, there are fears of potential violence in NI. Mr Sullivan's comments also come as the UK is trying to secure a free-trade deal with the US. He insisted he was not trying to ""negotiate in public"" or issue a ""warning"" to Boris Johnson's government, but merely stating ""how the president feels about this issue"". UK and EU urge compromises over Irish Sea border Why is there a UK-EU row over sausages? Thousands of extra police arrive ahead of G7 The UK and EU are in talks over simplifying the Northern Ireland Protocol, which set up a post-Brexit trade border between Northern Ireland and Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) in order to prevent goods checks along the Irish land border. Some checks are taking place on British goods going to Northern Ireland, causing some disruption to food supplies and online deliveries. Unionists are strongly opposed to these because they do not want Northern Ireland to be treated differently to the rest of the UK. Sinn FÃ©in, the SDLP, and Alliance have said there are problems with the protocol but have argued that the UK and EU must ensure its ""rigorous implementation"". One loyalist group haswritten to Mr Johnsonto withdraw support for the Good Friday Agreement - signed in 1998 following heavy involvement by the US - which helped bring an end to the Troubles. This video can not be played Biden adviser Jake Sullivan says the gains of the Good Friday Agreement must be protected In an interview with BBC North America editor Jon Sopel, Mr Sullivan said the success or failure of the Northern Ireland Protocol was ""critical to ensuring that the spirit, promise and future of the Good Friday Agreement is protected"". He urged the UK and EU to ""work out the specifics"" and ""find a way to proceed that works for both"", adding: ""But whatever way they find to proceed must at its core fundamentally protect the gains of the Good Friday Agreement and not imperil that."" That was the ""message President Biden will send"" at the G7 summit, which runs from Friday to Sunday in Carbis Bay, Cornwall, Mr Sullivan said. The conflict in Northern Ireland known as the Troubles lasted almost 30 years from the late 1960s, and cost the lives of more than 3,500 people. Northern Ireland was createdin 1921 and remained part of the UK, while the rest of Ireland became an independent state. This created a split in the population between the unionists - who were mainly Protestants and were happy to stay in the UK - and nationalists, who were predominantly Catholics and wanted to join the new Irish state. Many Catholics faced discrimination in jobs and housing and in the late 1960s began protests which were met with a crackdown from the Northern Ireland government. In 1969, after violence across Northern Ireland, the UK government deployed troops to restore public order. They were largely welcomed, but later armed groups from both sides, like the Irish Republican Army (IRA) and Ulster Defence Association (UDA), began carrying out bombings and shootings. Peace talks started in the early 1990s, and culminated in the signing of theGood Friday Agreementin 1998, which ended the worst of the violence. Issues including climate change and post-pandemic recovery are set to dominate the meeting of leaders of most of the world's biggest economies. The G7 summit also comes as the UK is keen to reach free-trade deals with other countries, including the US, as it readjusts its economy following Brexit. ""I'm not intending to send any warnings,"" Mr Sullivan said. But he added: ""Our concern [on Northern Ireland] does run deep. That is simply a statement of principle. That's how the president feels about this issue. ""What it does to a US-UK free-trade agreement, I don't want to sit here and negotiate in public... or make some claim or threat,"" Mr Sullivan said. ""We want to make sure that the work that the US, UK, and Ireland have all done, in addition to the key parties in NI, has got to be honoured and respected and protected as we go forward,"" he added. A senior UK government source said the government was ""positive"" about President Biden's engagement with Northern Ireland and the peace process, saying: ""We welcome the balanced tone from the US."" Jake Sullivan was very keen to impress upon me that, if the administration were a rock-'n'-roll band, this would be the ""America is back"" tour. He wants the world to know that the isolationist, poke-your-allies-in-the-eye Trump years are gone, that the familiar, multilateral America is returning. Mr Sullivan argues that on climate change, the global economy and leading the world out of the pandemic, the US will play a leading role. This will be welcomed by the other G7 nations after the bumpiness that came with his predecessor. But Mr Sullivan is aware that will be met with some scepticism too. After the scarring events of 6 January, when Washington's Capitol building was stormed, how can America be the role model of functioning liberal democracy? How reliable a partner will it be? Could the go-it-alone America re-emerge in four years' time? The UK has pushed back the full implementation of checks on supermarket goods and parcels travelling from Britain to Northern Ireland to ease disruption to supplies. This has prompted the EU to accuse the UK of undermining the Northern Ireland Protocol and begin legal action. The next phase of controls, on chilled meat products including sausages and mince, is due to begin on 1 July. The UK's Brexit minister, Lord Frost, is meeting his EU counterpart Maros Sefcovic in London to discuss ways to reduce trade disruption. He has urged the EU to show ""common sense"", but Mr Sefcovic has warned against ""quick fixes"" to border issues.

"The UK government faces a difficult choice in the next few days. Many people are desperate to see the return to normality promised by the final stage of the roadmap to lifting lockdown. But ministers always said 21 June was not set in stone - and could be affected by changes in the pandemic, including the emergence of new variants. What will they be weighing up as they make their final decision? Here are four key numbers to watch out for in the coming days. There are just under 1,000 people with coronavirus in hospitals in the UK, up about 5% from a low point a week ago. That's far below the peak of nearly 40,000 people in January. And NHS Providers say the people who are going in aren't as seriously ill as they were in early waves. They are younger, or don't require intensive care as much - and they're coming out sooner. That means this wave is different, and better, than previous ones but eventually rising admissions will mount up. In the two parts of the UK that are furthest into this ""third wave"", the North West of England and Scotland, the number of people in hospital with coronavirus is rising faster than the rest of the UK. How far and how fast this trend develops depends on how fast infections are rising and how likely you are to get seriously sick with the new variant. Health Secretary Matt Hancock told Parliament on Tuesday that the main type of coronavirus in the UK - the Delta variant first identified in India - is ""at least 40%"" more transmissible than the version that sparked the winter wave - the Alpha variant first seen in Kent. And as Delta takes over, infections are on the rise again. Last week, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) suggested thatUK infections had risen by 60% in a single week. If that growth rate remains steady or picks up, it suggests that cases will rise pretty quickly if and when society reopens further. We'll learn more on Friday. But rising infections on their own aren't a reason to extend lockdown. The government'skey test,externalis whether rising infections ""risk a surge in hospitalisations which would put unsustainable pressure on the NHS"". And that also depends on your chances of getting seriously ill if you catch coronavirus. When could social distancing end? That is much harder to predict now than it was in the first or second waves, when scientists could predict what proportion of cases would need treatment. That's because vaccines do reduce your chance of getting really sick if you do get infected with any variant. Already we can see thatwhile people who have been double jabbed make up more than 40% of the population, they make up fewer than 5% of people who have been admitted to hospitalwith the Delta variant. But it does look like it takes two doses before someone gets high levels of protection from that variant. So there's a race on: double-jab as many people as possible, before the virus spreads enough to find the vulnerable or to put pressure on the NHS. More than 50% of adults have been given the best protection possible - two doses of the vaccine. That's still a way off herd immunity, even if you add in people who have some immunity from having had coronavirus in the past. Say each infected person would, on average, pass the virus on to six other people in a fully open society that hadn't seen the virus before. Then five out of six people, not just five out of six adults, would need to be able to fight off the virus - that would be the ""herd immunity threshold"". We're not there yet, and it's possible that the threshold is higher as Delta could be more infectious than imagined in this example. But every person vaccinated helps to slow the spread. How many people have been vaccinated so far? To predict what rising infections will mean for the NHS, you need to know how fast cases will rise and how many cases will get really sick. We don't know either figure precisely, and probably won't by 14 June. And a rough estimate doesn't help. The last time UK government modellers made their forecasts, the difference between ""40% more transmissible"" (the orange line below) and ""50% more transmissible"" (the blue line below) made a huge difference to the predicted severity of a third wave. And then, to know what to do about rising cases, you need to predict what effect any change to the rules might have on spread. It's uncertainty piled on uncertainty. To know the cost of that action, you need to know what effect another few weeks of being shut, or trading at a loss, would do to the businesses that are desperate to open up. It's a mammoth task and one that will require some old-fashioned political judgement as well as hi-tech epidemiological models. LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area?

"The number of infections among younger children has passed the peak in early January Recorded Covid infections among children are now the highest they have been during the outbreak in Scotland. Weekly infections in 0-14 year olds reached 1,064 on 7 June - higher than the peak in early January, according to Public Health Scotland. While there is no evidence children are becoming seriously ill, growing numbers of pupils are off school. Nicola Sturgeon has said Scotland would move quickly to vaccinate 12-15 year olds if recommended by the regulator. The number of cases among the youngest age group is rising rapidly, having seen a near four-fold increase since early May. Despite the rise,medics have said children's wards are not seeing any significant rise in admissionsdue to Covid and said there is no reason for parents to worry. However, a number of schools have had to shut temporarily because of pupils testing positive, with St Peter's Primary in Galashiels among the latest to announce a short closure to allow contact tracing. Scotland would move quickly to vaccinate children Global vaccination should be 'focus' over teenagers UK approves Pfizer jab for 12 to 15-year-olds While most schools are open, growing numbers of pupils have been asked to stay home because they are possible contacts of pupils who have tested positive. Provisional figures indicate 15,687 pupils were absent for Covid-related reasons at the end of last week, with overall attendance dropping to 87.8%, the lowest percentage since pupils returned after Easter. Children under the age of 15 represent about quarter of the daily case numbers in recent weeks in terms of total numbers. However, when the size of the population in each age group is factored in, it is clear that infection rates are considerably higher among young adults and older teenagers. On 7 June, the weekly case rate among people in their early 20s was 277.2 per 100,000. Older teenagers had the second highest rate, at 228.4, while for younger children it was 122.9. What is clear from the data is that infections among older age groups are relatively low during the latest outbreaks, possibly a reflection of the rollout of the vaccination programme. More than half of Scotland's adult population has now had both doses of a Covid vaccine. The UK regulator hasapproved the use of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine in childrenaged 12-15. The Scottish government is now awaiting advice from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI)  on whether it should begin vaccinating children. On Tuesday the first minister said the focus remained on getting all adults vaccinated but if the JCVI recommends vaccination of children, she saidScotland would ""move as quickly as possible to implement the advice"". Should all children get a vaccine? Scottish government adviser Prof Devi Sridhar has backed the rollout of the vaccine to those over the age of 12. Speaking to ITV's Good Morning Britain earlier this week, she said: ""If we want schools to continue without disruption in the autumn and lift restrictions so children can have a normal experience, we need to vaccinate them â if we wait and watch for the evidence it will be too late in the next few weeks. ""We have the supply. It's not a large amount, it's a couple of million doses to cover that population of 12-plus. ""Given that we know children can transmit, where we are going to see problems is not going to be in care homes, it's not going to be in hospitals, it's going to be in schools."" High school pupils in Scotland retuned to face-to-face lessons after the Easter holidays Another leading health expert, Prof Linda Bauld, has said she ""really welcomed"" plans to vaccinate teenagers but said completing the adult age groups must come first. She told theBBC's Good Morning Scotland programme:""They will be next in line after we have issued vaccinations to all the 18-29 year olds, as Wales has already done. I really welcome the vaccine programme for teenagers... it will make a difference but they will not be able to receive it until older groups have. ""Over two million teenagers in the US have already received the vaccine, the trials suggest it's safe, so let's hope this all goes well."" With world leaders facing calls to do more to share vaccines internationally, some have argued a greater priority should be driving down infections globally, which could be the source of new variants. Christine Tait-Burkhard, an infection expert from University of Edinburgh, said it was a complex issue because while vaccination might help school attendance, there is little evidence of children becoming seriously ill. She told Drivetime with John Beattie: ""The last question is an ethical one. If we are starting to vaccinate children in this country yet other countries haven't got any vaccines or very little vaccines to vaccinate their most vulnerable. ""It is not only an ethical question, it's also a message that it sends to the world that says we don't care."" Prof Adam Finn, a member of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, has said that if enough immunity was built up through the adult vaccination programme then vaccinating children may not be justified. He said: ""The issue is not that there's a problem doing it, it's just a question of whether we need to do it, given the very low incidence of serious illness in children and the fact that we're achieving so much with the adult programme at the moment with very high coverage. ""If indeed it turns out that children can be indirectly protected by the immunity that we induce in adults then there's clearly no justification for immunising - or at least immunising all of them.""

"The ESL proposals sparked a number of fan protests outside the clubs' stadiums The six Premier League clubs involved in the European Super League (ESL) have agreed to make a combined ""goodwill"" payment of Â£22m. Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United and Tottenhamwanted to form a breakaway league. Should they attempt a similar project again, the clubs will be fined Â£25m each and have 30 points deducted. Meanwhile, Uefa has temporarily paused disciplinary proceedings against Juventus, Barcelona and Real Madrid. They are the only three clubs from the 12 that signed up that are yet to accept any punishment or renounce the ESL. European football's governing body had opened disciplinary proceedings against them in May. In a joint statement, the Football Association and Premier League said the English clubs had ""collectively agreed"" to make a payment of Â£22m as ""a gesture of goodwill"". The money ""will go towards the good of the game"", which includes ""new investment in support for fans"" and will help fund grassroots and community projects. ""The six clubs involved in proposals to form a European Super League have acknowledged once again that their actions were a mistake, and have reconfirmed their commitment to the Premier League and the future of the English game,"" the two bodies said in a statement. ""They have wholeheartedly apologised to their fans, fellow clubs, the Premier League and the FA. ""The Premier League and the FA have worked closely together throughout this process, and this agreement brings both investigations into the matter to a conclusion."" BBC Sport understands Manchester United's owners the Glazer family, Liverpool owners Fenway Sports Group, Arsenal's majority shareholders Kroenke Sports Enterprises and Tottenham's owners will pay the fine rather than their clubs. Former Manchester United and England defender Gary Neville, who has beena vocal critic of football's governance and the ESL,tweeted the punishment was ""an absolute embarrassment"". How football's volatile 48 hours unfolded Nine of the ESL clubs - the six Premier League sides, plus AC Milan, Inter Milan and Atletico Madrid -were fined a similar amountby European governing body Uefa last month. They agreed to pay 15m euros (Â£13.4m) between them and have 5% of their Uefa competition revenues held for one season, starting in 2023-24. In May, Uefa said the other three clubs involved - Real, Barca and Juve - would face ""appropriate action"" having failed to distance themselves from the ESL. BBC Sport was told the clubs were risking being removed from the Champions League if the case went against them, but that now looks unlikely. The three clubs believe an order issued by a Madrid court in April that prevents Uefa taking action against them is valid in Switzerland, where the governing body is based. This has now been passed to the European Court of Justice for a ruling, which has led to the initial case being stopped. Uefa said it was ""confident"" in its case and would ""continue to defend its position in all the relevant jurisdictions"". Football Supporters' Association chair Malcolm Clarke says the Â£22m payment should not be the end of the matter if the Premier League wants to ensure a similar breakaway proposal will not return in the future. ""It cannot guarantee that clubs won't try similar again in the decades ahead,"" he said. ""The European Super League's legacy should be a total restructure of the game - an independent regulator, genuine power to fans, and wealth redistribution."" The negative reaction to the ESL has sparked a huge debate about how football is run. The government has already announced a fan-led review into football governance and the prospect of an independent regulator in English football is set for a parliamentary debate after a petition, launched by a number of ex-footballers,gained more than 100,000 signatures.

"Joe's sister Alex says her brother suffered mood swings Joe began buying what he believed were genuine diazepam and Xanex pills from the internet to help with anxiety. But he became addicted to the fake pills - which he continued to believe were real - and earlier this year they almost killed him. Joe had struggled with shyness in his late teens and, like many, he found moving away to university a challenge. But when the 23-year-old returned home to rural mid Wales after his first year, mum Sarah was initially excited to see changes in him. ""I would say his personality had changed,"" said Sarah. ""He was much louder and almost like a little bit brash. Naively, I thought he'd just come out of his shell."" What Sarah didn't know was Joe - not their real names - had begun to self-medicate with what he believed were genuine diazepam and Xanax pills bought online in an effort to help with his anxiety. It wasn't long before his family noticed other changes in him too. Joe's mum found him after he had overdosed on fake prescription pills and suffered a cardiac arrest ""He'd go through phases of sleep walking, mood changes, very dilated pupils,"" said 25-year-old Alex, Joe's older sister. ""I asked him to talk to me as a sibling, I said I wouldn't say anything to mum and dad, but he never did."" How can I overcome my anxiety? 'Major concern' over online drug purchases Call for further improvement in mental health care When he returned to university for his second year, his mum began to get phone calls from him in the middle of the night. ""He said 'I've been using prescription drugs to try and help myself and I think it's getting out of control','"" said Sarah. ""I became aware he was buying them on the internet and that he was using them to address his mental health issues. He'd researched what he thought he needed to take - and in his mind he'd tackled the problem. ""But as things got worse I think he became very afraid that he was being overtaken by the addiction."" When he was at home normal-looking packages would arrive for him - inside were what he believed to be prescription drugs. He eventually showed his mum them, hoping to reassure her. Prescription drugs have to be prescribed by your GP but many people, like Joe, are going online to buy pills that they believe are legitimate to avoid consulting with a doctor. Joe's mum and sister had been getting worried about his sudden mood swings ""It was mostly diazepam,"" she said. ""It was in fully printed and marked packaging with batch numbers, dates and the information leaflet inside. ""To me they were the genuine drugs - and to Joe they were the genuine drugs. ""He used to say to me 'I know not to take too many, I know how many I should take, I'm in control, don't worry mum.' ""It didn't for one minute enter my mind that it wasn't what it said on the tin."" However the pills weren't what they claimed to be. Joe showed his mum the drugs he had bought online in an attempt to reassure her According to drugs testing lab Wedinos, between 45% to 65% of benzodiazepines sent in for testing, which include diazepam and Xanax, are actually fakes. These pills can use unregulated and much stronger ingredients, frequently leaving users with pills up to 10 times stronger than what they think they are taking. Joe had no idea the pills he was taking were fake. Earlier this year his mum went to wake him, only to find he had overdosed. ""I could see as soon as I approached the door that he was lying across his bed,"" recalled Sarah. ""The look of him, the feel of him, it just said to me 'he's dead, he's gone.' ""I just became hysterical. There was no-one in the house. I dialled the emergency services - and I couldn't speak - I was just shouting."" The paramedics battled to save Joe's life for hours. Eventually a decision was made to try to move him to hospital. According to a drugs testing lab about a half of benzodiazepines sent in for testing, which include diazepam and Xanax, are fakes. Sarah was told he could die on the way down the stairs, let alone the long journey to the nearest emergency department. Joe had suffered a cardiac arrest.  He survived, but suffered major brain damage. ""The prescription drugs that Joe had been buying on the internet were not legitimate,"" she said. ""It wasn't what he believed, and I believed, was in the tablets.

"Laws on coal tips were brought in after the Aberfan disaster in 1966 Plans to overhaul ""outdated"" laws introduced following the Aberfan coal tip disaster have been unveiled. A mountain of coal waste collapsed on the village's schoolin the south Wales valleys in October 1966, killing 116 children and 28 adults It led to changes in the way coal tips were managed across the country. But these rules have been described as ""no longer fit for purpose"" and a new system to monitor tips has been put forward. The proposals have been developed by the Law Commission of England and Wales, and would replace the Mines and Quarries Act, brought in to force in 1969 following the disaster. Under the plans, it is claimed tip safety would improve, with earlier intervention at sites to prevent problems developing. A new body would be set up to supervise tips in Wales, with powers to: Compile and maintain a list of all disused tips Arrange inspections and tip management plans The power to designate tips as a ""high risk"" of slides or other dangers - bringing in an enhanced safety regime at a site This video can not be played In February 2020, 60,000 tonnes slipped down the hillside at Tylorstown ""The laws governing coal tips in Wales date from an earlier age and no longer offer adequate tools to manage Wales' legacy of coal tips,"" said Nicholas Paines QC, the public law commissioner at the Law Commission of England and Wales. ""We think our proposed reforms would significantly improve the management of coal tips and especially the highest-risk tips."" TÂ£2.5m from UK government for tip slip From toil to tourism: Wales' industrial past The issue of tip dangers in Wales was highlighted last year following Storm Dennis, when60,000 tonnes of coal waste slipped from the hillsideabove Tylorstown in Rhondda Cynon Taf. It led to checks on more than 100 tips considered to be of highest risk from storm damage,with a Â£500m price tag put on the bill to make all Wales' 2,000 disused sites secure. But Mr Paines stressed ""only a small minority of tips have the potential to be a danger"". He said new laws would help avert that danger and make sure work was carried out to reduce risks. The Law Commission said the laws brought in following Aberfan were ""fragmented"" across councils, with inconsistent safety plans and risk management. Wales has 2,000 disused tips - in 2020 this one at Tylorstown in the Rhondda slid down the hillside The commission said there were no mechanisms in place to prioritise tips at highest risk and needing urgent work. There were also no powers for councils to intervene until there was an imminent danger, and no powers to ensure maintenance had been carried out in the first place. The Welsh government's new Climate Minister, Julie James, said the legislation being put forward was an important part of ""action to heal these industrial scars and create a stronger, greener and fairer Wales"". She said it also recognised the direct impact climate change could have on Welsh communities. ""To protect the wellbeing of communities who live in the presence of coal tips, the legislation needs to be improved to reflect advances in scientific knowledge, the changes in our economy and society, and the implications of our changing climate."" A public consultation on the new proposals runs until 10 September, with a final report for Welsh government due in early 2022.

"Signs, like this one in County Antrim, have appeared in parts of NI, in response to the NI Protocol Eight prominent unionists involved in negotiating theGood Friday Agreementhave called for the Northern Ireland Protocol to be suspended. A letter has been sent to Prime Minister Boris Johnson, taoiseach (Irish PM) MicheÃ¡l Martin, US President Joe Biden and European Commission vice president Maros Sefcovic. Among the signatories are Lord Trimble, Lord Maginnis and Lord Empey. They saythe NI Protocoldisrespects the integrity of the UK. The signatories of the letter said the protocol breaches many of the guarantees that were in Good Friday Agreement and that the mechanism works against the wishes of unionists in Northern Ireland and therefore is unacceptable. Why are there Brexit checks in Northern Ireland? Irish Sea border 'still causing difficulties' What is the Good Friday Agreement? Lord Trimble had been positiveabout Boris Johnson's Brexit deal in the past. In 2019he described the prime minister's deal as ""fully in accordance with the spirit of the Good Friday Agreement"". The letter has been sent to Boris Johnson, Joe Biden, MicheÃ¡l Martin, Maros Sefcovic Who signed the letter? Lord Trimble Lord Kilclooney Lord Maginnis Lord Empey Mr Dermot Nesbitt Cllr Billy Hutchinson Mr David Campbell Mr Gary McMichael The men wrote that they had signed the Good Friday Agreement - the key document that helped bringthe Troubles in Northern Irelandto an end - ""in the belief that that it guaranteed that our country's constitutional status would not change without the consent of its people exercised in a free vote"". They said it was their belief any ""significant decision affecting the lives and livelihoods of all our people would require the consent of both communities here"". Former UUP leader Lord Trimble won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1998 for his role in the Good Friday Agreement The letter continued: ""A fundamental principle of international law is respect for the territorial integrity of a country. ""The protocol completely disrespects the territorial integrity of the United Kingdom. ""Consequently, you are collectively guilty of exceptional anti-democratic behaviour, of breaking a fundamental principle of international law, and are imperilling the very peace process you claim to want to protect and preserve. ""We expect you to now suspend the Northern Ireland Protocol forthwith and engage with the representatives of the people of Northern Ireland to agree new arrangements which are consistent with the guarantees and provisions of the Belfast Agreement and which command the support of both communities in Northern Ireland.""

"This video can not be played Protecting trade flows east-west and north-south across the island of Ireland is ""easily doable"", says Boris Johnson The EU says its patience is ""wearing very thin"" with the UK in talks aimed at avoiding a post-Brexit trade war. Top EU official Maros Sefcovic said the UK must start checking goods entering Northern Ireland, as agreed in the 2019 Brexit ""divorce"" settlement. The UK says it is ready to ignore the rules to prevent further disruption - sparking threats of EU retaliation. Boris Johnson said a solution that protects trade flows and the peace process was ""easily doable"". And he dismissed talk of a trade war with the EU, saying he was ""not worried"" it would overshadow the G7 summit. The prime minister is in Cornwall, where he will host the leaders of the world's richest nations, including US President Joe Biden, who is said to have ""deep"" concerns that a UK-EU trade row could endanger peace in Northern Ireland. Why is there a UK-EU row over sausages? Don't imperil NI peace, Biden to warn UK and EU EU to begin legal action over NI Protocol 'breach' Asked about this, Mr Johnson said everyone needed to be ""absolutely clear"" that the purpose of the Northern Ireland protocol - the part of the Brexit deal at the centre of the row - was to ""uphold the Belfast Good Friday Agreement, to make sure that we keep the balance in relationships in Northern Ireland"". He said he was ""optimistic"" a solution could be found that ""protects the peace process, but also guarantees the economic and territorial integrity of the whole United Kingdom"". Lord Frost (L) has been discussing border issues with his EU counterpart Maros Sefcovic in central London Talks between Mr Sefcovic - a vice-president of the European Commission - and UK Brexit minister Lord Frost broke up earlier without agreement. Mr Sefcovic said he was ""positive we can find a solution"" but added: ""Our patience really is wearing very, very thin, and therefore we have to assess all options we have at our disposal."" This could include legal action, arbitration or retaliatory trade measures such as tariffs, he explained. He said ""trust"" had to be restored between the two sides, after the UK had broken the terms of the 2019 Northern Ireland protocol. A key flashpoint is a looming ban on the export of sausages and other chilled meats from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) no longer follows EU rules but Northern Ireland does - because it shares a land border with the Republic of Ireland, an EU member. EU food safety rules do not allow chilled meat products to enter its market from non-members like the UK. Frozen meat is not covered by the rules. In January, the two sides agreed a six month ""grace"" period to allow companies to set up alternative supply chains, but that runs out at the end of June. The UK has already held back from carrying out full checks on supermarket goods and parcels moving from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, prompting the EU to accuse the UK of undermining the protocol and tobegin legal proceedings. Mr Sefcovic said: ""If the UK were to take further unilateral action in the coming weeks the EU will not be shy in acting swiftly, firmly and resolutely to ensure the UK abides by its international obligations."" A UK source close to the negotiations said: ""Nobody wants to get into a trade war or anything close to it."" It was ""much better to find agreed ways forward"", added the source, and ""the people in Northern Ireland want solutions not threats"". ""But unfortunately we have got used to living in an atmosphere where there are threats."" Asked by ITV's Robert Peston if the UK would take unilateral action, Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis said ""we're not at that stage yet but we've said we will keep all options open."" There's a clash of cultures at the heart of this increasingly serious dispute. The EU is a union of laws and rules - and once it has an agreement it tends to stick to the details. The British government, on the other hand, decided to kick some of the details down the road in its desire to ""Get Brexit Done"". But those details never went away, and now they are threatening to provoke another crisis in Britain's relationship with Europe, and to destabilise Northern Ireland. During the 2019 general election campaign Boris Johnson said there would be no checks on goods moving in either direction between Great Britain and Northern Ireland as a result of his Brexit deal, even though official documents at the time made clear that there would be. Now his government says the EU needs to show more flexibility, that it's being too legalistic. The practicalities of implementing the Northern Ireland Protocol in full are certainly pretty challenging. Northern Ireland's chief vet recently told Assembly members in Belfast that it would require more checks on food than are done in the whole of the EU. And he only has 12 vets. The EU says it is prepared to be flexible, but says the UK cannot walk away from its legal obligations. Both sides talk about ""considering all our options"" if a compromise can't be found. In public at least, it's hard to see where the common ground lies. Mr Sefcovic said the EU had offered a temporary solution to the chilled meats row, ahead of a comprehensive trade deal, but he said the UK was not prepared to accept it because it would involve signing up to EU food standards. ""Ideology prevails over what is good for the people of Northern Ireland,"" he added. Northern Irish ports such as Larne have seen additional border checks under the protocol Speaking after his meeting with Mr Sefcovic, Lord Frost said the protocol was ""being implemented in a way which is causing disruption in Northern Ireland and we had some pretty frank and honest discussions about that situation"". ""There weren't any breakthroughs, there weren't any breakdowns either and we are going to carry on talking,"" he added. ""What we really now need to do is very urgently find some solutions, which support the Belfast Good Friday Agreement, Support the peace process in Northern Ireland and allow things to return to normal."" Government 'knew NI Protocol was bad deal' Can sea border âteething problemsâ be solved? Lord Frost said the EU was insisting that the two sides ""operate the protocol in an extremely purist way"" and he did not see any problem with continuing to allow exports of chilled meats. ""We don't see what risk is caused to Northern Ireland if chilled meats are imported there from GB."" Northern Ireland's deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill - who also took part in the meeting - challenged the UK government to ""honour its commitments"" on the Brexit protocol. ""Certainly there's a frustration that the British government have signed up to this agreement, however they have failed to bring forward ways to implement the Protocol in its entirety,"" she added.

"Laws on coal tips were brought in after the Aberfan disaster in 1966 Plans to overhaul ""outdated"" laws introduced following the Aberfan coal tip disaster have been unveiled. A mountain of coal waste collapsed on the village's schoolin the south Wales valleys in October 1966, killing 116 children and 28 adults It led to changes in the way coal tips were managed across the country. But these rules have been described as ""no longer fit for purpose"" and a new system to monitor tips has been put forward. The proposals have been developed by the Law Commission of England and Wales, and would replace the Mines and Quarries Act, brought in to force in 1969 following the disaster. Under the plans, it is claimed tip safety would improve, with earlier intervention at sites to prevent problems developing. A new body would be set up to supervise tips in Wales, with powers to: Compile and maintain a list of all disused tips Arrange inspections and tip management plans The power to designate tips as a ""high risk"" of slides or other dangers - bringing in an enhanced safety regime at a site This video can not be played In February 2020, 60,000 tonnes slipped down the hillside at Tylorstown ""The laws governing coal tips in Wales date from an earlier age and no longer offer adequate tools to manage Wales' legacy of coal tips,"" said Nicholas Paines QC, the public law commissioner at the Law Commission of England and Wales. ""We think our proposed reforms would significantly improve the management of coal tips and especially the highest-risk tips."" TÂ£2.5m from UK government for tip slip From toil to tourism: Wales' industrial past The issue of tip dangers in Wales was highlighted last year following Storm Dennis, when60,000 tonnes of coal waste slipped from the hillsideabove Tylorstown in Rhondda Cynon Taf. It led to checks on more than 100 tips considered to be of highest risk from storm damage,with a Â£500m price tag put on the bill to make all Wales' 2,000 disused sites secure. But Mr Paines stressed ""only a small minority of tips have the potential to be a danger"". He said new laws would help avert that danger and make sure work was carried out to reduce risks. The Law Commission said the laws brought in following Aberfan were ""fragmented"" across councils, with inconsistent safety plans and risk management. Wales has 2,000 disused tips - in 2020 this one at Tylorstown in the Rhondda slid down the hillside The commission said there were no mechanisms in place to prioritise tips at highest risk and needing urgent work. There were also no powers for councils to intervene until there was an imminent danger, and no powers to ensure maintenance had been carried out in the first place. The Welsh government's new Climate Minister, Julie James, said the legislation being put forward was an important part of ""action to heal these industrial scars and create a stronger, greener and fairer Wales"". She said it also recognised the direct impact climate change could have on Welsh communities. ""To protect the wellbeing of communities who live in the presence of coal tips, the legislation needs to be improved to reflect advances in scientific knowledge, the changes in our economy and society, and the implications of our changing climate."" A public consultation on the new proposals runs until 10 September, with a final report for Welsh government due in early 2022.

"More than a million coronavirus vaccine bookings were made on the NHS website yesterday - a record total The NHS chief executive compares the demand, on the first day all 25 to 29-year-olds could book, to the rush for Glastonbury tickets The UK has recorded another 7,540 coronavirus cases, the highest number reported in a day since 26 February About 8 in 10 adults in the UK had antibodies to coronavirus by 17 May, according to the Office for National Statistics Asked about a possible delay to the 21 June easing of restrictions, Boris Johnson says there are arguments being made both ways He says data is still being studied, including on how much impact the ""phenomenal"" vaccine rollout is having The PM's former adviser Dominic Cummings has been asked for evidence of claims he made to MPs a fortnight ago Cummings questioned Health Secretary Matt Hancockâs honesty when quizzed about the handling of early stages of the pandemic The US eases travel restrictions for 61 countries as the roll-out of coronavirus vaccines continues - but not the UK France is easing some of its lockdown measures in time for the summer Edited by James Clarke We're ending our live coverage today, thanks for
joining us. Weâll be back tomorrow morning with more coronavirus news. Todayâs updates
were brought to you by Victoria Lindrea, Jennifer Meierhans, Joshua Nevett, Ella
Willis and Katie Wright. The page was edited by James Clarke. We'll shortly be pausing our live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic. Here's a round-up of the main headlines today: This video can not be played Free Hugs: Does Covid mean the end of hugging strangers? The Covid pandemic put a stop to the Free Hugs movement - with social distancing guidelines and restrictions in place in countries around the world. The group used to offer hugs to strangers every weekend - but they say any decision to relax social distancing should be treated with caution. BBC health reporter, Laura Foster, spoke to some members of Free Hugs UK about the importance of hugs and when they might be able to freely hug again. The Penta Hotel in Reading's Oxford Rd opened as a quarantine facility on 29 April A local council has called on the government to shut a quarantine hotel in Reading after a total of 44 positive cases of Covid-19 were identified among residents and staff. Reading Council says it is ""unconvinced"" the outbreak is under control or that robust safety measures are in place. The quarantine facility, run by the Department of Health and Social Care, opened on 29 April. Reading Borough Council says it was notified of the first Covid outbreak on 9 May. The local authority says cases have spread ""between guests, and hotel and security staff"". It says it believes at least three cases in the community have been directly linked to the hotel's outbreak and the spread ""could have been avoided had the correct safety procedures been in place"" at the outset. The majority of the positive cases have been identified as the Delta variant. The Department for Health and Social Care has been approached for comment. Prime Minister Boris Johnson says itâs
too early to say if England's lockdown can end on 21 June as data on whether
the vaccine rollout offers enough protection from the Delta variant is still being assessed. ""On Monday... we'll have a look
at where we are. I think what everybody can see very clearly is that cases are
going up, and in some places hospitalisations are going up,"" he says, speaking in Cornwall ahead of the G7 conference. ""What we need to assess is the
extent to which the vaccine rollout - which has been phenomenal - has built up
protection in the population in order for us to go ahead to the next stage. And
so that's what we'll be looking at."" As we reported earlier, the UK has recorded another 7,540 coronavirus cases over the past 24 hours - the highest number of daily cases reported since the end of February. Cases have risen dramatically over the past week, with a seven-day average of 5,984 - as the Delta variant continues to make its presence felt. But the number of cases is still far off the peak in January - and daily deaths remain low: on Wednesday, data showed a further six deaths within 28 days of a positive test - compared with 12 deaths a week ago. Scientists attribute the fall in both hospitalisations and deaths to the success of the vaccine rollout. More than half the adult population - 54.2% - are now fully vaccinated, while 77.3% have had one jab.   High school pupils in Scotland retuned to face-to-face lessons after the Easter holidays The number of Covid infections recorded among children in Scotland is now at the highest level it has been since the start of the outbreak. Weekly infections among children aged up to 14 reached 1,064 on 7 June - higher than the peak in early January, according to Public Health Scotland. While there is no evidence children are becoming seriously ill - with no significant rise in hospital admissions - growing numbers of pupils are off school. Provisional figures indicate 15,687 pupils were absent for Covid-related reasons at the end of last week, with overall attendance dropping to 87.8%. Data shows a four-fold increase in cases among children under 15, but infection rates are still considerably higher among young adults and older teenagers. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said Scotland will move quickly to vaccinate 12-15 year olds if recommended by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation. Read the full story. A number of government reviews are currently under way looking at Covid-19 measures in England. Their findings will inform wider policy forstep four of the roadmap plan,external- which will happen on 21 June at the earliest, butcould be delayed past then. What
reviews are there?  Find out morehere. Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics The number of people in
hospital with coronavirus is on the rise again and reached 1,024 on Monday 7 June,
rising above 1,000 for the first time since mid-May. Back then, numbers were
falling and they reached a low point of just under 870 on 27 May. But they have risen by nearly
20% in the 11 days since then. This is still far below the
peak in Januaryâs wave when nearly 40,000 people were in hospital with
coronavirus in the UK. And people in the NHS say the cases theyâre seeing now are less serious than in previous waves. But they underline the inevitable
impact of the rising case numbers that we have been seeing in the UK. The rises in people in
hospital are driven by increasing numbers of people in hospital in Scotland and
the North West of England, the region and nation where cases have been rising
for the longest in the UK in the early stages of this third wave. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Traffic control measures have been imposed in parts of Guangzhou in an attempt to limit the spread of the virus In the past 24
hours, China has confirmed eight new domestic symptomatic cases of Covid-19,
all in southern Guangdong province. This is the
only area of mainland China where there is currently an outbreak; 164 people
are currently in hospital across the province. Most patients are in the
populous city of Guangzhou, which along with the nearby city of Foshan and
Wuchuan County, has local lockdowns in place. Guangzhou is
one of Chinaâs biggest cities, and as cases of mutant variants have been
detected, there have been some fears that it could see a large-scale outbreak,
like those seen in the cities ofWuhanorShijiazhuang. However, huge
vaccine uptake has helped China avoid a third wave â more than 800 million
vaccine doses have now been administeredacross the country,externaland recent media reports have suggested new patients have exhibited mild or no
symptoms. Even with
triple-digit cases, tens of thousands of students have still been able to sit
their university entrance exams in Guangzhou this week. This would have been
unthinkable during earlier outbreaks â Chinaâs approach to date has been to
swiftly lock down communities and order mass testing drives, allowing people
very little room for manoeuvre. But vaccination uptake has helped China relax
its Covid-19 regulations. Local governments have been increasingly finding safe
ways for events to go ahead, rather than simply cancelling them. It is still
not clear how this latest outbreak began. Health officials in Guangzhou say the genetic sequencing of cases in the city show a 98% similarity,
suggesting they are all linked to the same chain of transmission. A local
health commission official tells the official CCTV broadcasterâmore investigation is needed to identify patient zeroâ,external. Philippa RoxbyHealth reporter, BBC News There are still many unknowns about the Delta variant, first
detected in India, which is causing a worrying rise in cases and hospital
admissions in some areas of the UK. Overall, the virus is still at low levels â but there is now
clear concern from scientists that a third wave could be on its way. Prof Neil Ferguson, virus modeller from Imperial College
London, tells journalists the size and scale of that wave depends on how
effective the vaccines are at protecting against illness from the Delta
variant. That still isnât clear and more data needs to be collected. The Delta variant could be anywhere from 40-80% more
transmissible, he says, with 60% his âbest estimateâ. âBut thereâs still an enormous amount of uncertainty,â he
adds. In the meantime, administering as many second doses as
quickly as possible is a priority - to give people the best possible protection. As for easing final restrictions on 21 June, there is
caution from Prof Ferguson. Delaying unlocking, he says, would allow more people to be
vaccinated - and reduce the size of a third wave. But the final say rests with
the government.  Vaccines
should be prioritised for high-risk areas where there are a large number of cases
of the Delta variant, say a group of MPs and council leaders from north-west England. In a letter
to the prime minister, the group - which includes Blackburn MP Kate Hollern and
leader of Manchester City Council Sir Richard Leese - say the challenges
posed by the Delta variant are different to those faced by the country a few
months ago. Greater Manchester and Lancashire accounts for 90% of the areas with the highest infection rates in England, according to last week's data. The local leaders say with the vast majority of the most vulnerable fully vaccinated,
the âfocus should now shiftâ to areas where the likelihood of contracting the
Delta variant is greatest. The
letter calls on the government to ensure vaccines are making their way to
areas âthat need them mostâ, adding: âDoing so would not only benefit our local areas, but the national effort to contain
the spread of the Delta variant.â Around three million text messages are being sent out over this week to ask 25 to 29-year-olds to book their coronavirus vaccine through the national booking service. GPs are also set to urge the newly-eligible groups to come forward over the coming days. Text invitations, which do not expire, should appear as an alert from ""NHSvaccine"" and include a web link to the NHS website to reserve an appointment. When invited, people will be able to book at one of the 1,600 vaccination centres, pharmacies or GP sites across the country that are available through the national booking service. Vaccination centres are also popping up in places such as mosques, museums and sports stadiums. Who can book the vaccine now? Find out here. The UKâs latest
figures also show the number of people to have had one vaccine dose is now
40.7 million, while the number who have received both doses is 28.5 million. That's 77.3%
of the adult population who have had one jab, and 54.2% who have had two jabs. The UK
has recorded another 7,540 coronavirus cases,according to the latest government figures.,external That is
the highest number of daily cases reported since 26 February. The
seven-day average for cases is up by 66%, amid concerns the Delta variant is
fuelling a rise in infections. There
have also been a further six deaths within 28 days of a positive test. Today's figures compare with 4,330 cases a week ago and 12 deaths. We've got more now on the record day for vaccination bookings. When vaccine appointments opened to 25 to 29-year-olds yesterday the initial surge prompted 100,000 bookings an hour between 07:00 BST and midday, according to NHS figures. NHS chief executive Sir Simon Stevens labels it a ""Glastonbury-style"" rush for jabs - a reference to the traditional stampede to book tickets for the music festival. He says: ""The obvious enthusiasm of younger adults to get their jab has blown out of the water the suggestion that people in their 20s might not come forward to protect themselves and their loved ones."" Hitting one million bookings in a day ""sends a fantastic signal"", says Dr Emily Lawson, lead for the NHS Covid Vaccination Programme. She says it shows ""the Covid-19 vaccine is something that all of us - no matter our age â can value and be excited by and most importantly should get, when our opportunity comes."" Coronavirus vaccine bookings on the NHS website reached a record high of more than one million yesterday. It's first time daily appointments made through the national booking service have topped the million mark. As vaccines were opened up to people aged 25 to 29 yesterday morning, a total of 1,082,596 first and second dose slots were snapped up across the day online and by phone. That's about 45,000 an hour on average and more than 750 every minute, over the full 24 hours. The daily total for the National Booking Service yesterday means around four times as many slots were booked yesterday compared with the day before and the same day last week. Covid-19 testing in Northern Ireland's post-primary schools is to be extended to all pupils from this week until the end of the summer term. Previously, lateral flow device (LFD) testshad been made available to older students in years 12 to 14 onlywhere prevalence of Covid-19 tends to be higher. But for the final fortnight of term, the twice-weekly tests will be expanded to cover years eight to 11 - encompassing pupils aged 12 and upwards. NI Education Minister Peter Weir is urging schools ""to make use of their stock of LFD kits to extend the offer to all pupils in Years 8-11 for the remaining weeks of term"". ""The purpose of asymptomatic testing is to find individuals who are infected but do not realise it."" he explains. ""They can then be advised to isolate so reducing the risk of them unwittingly spreading infection in the school and elsewhere."" Read the full story. The chairs of two parliamentary select committees have written to Dominic Cummings asking him to provide documentary evidence for âseveral serious allegationsâ he made last month. In the letter, sent last week, Greg Clark and Jeremy Hunt asked for evidence for the claims Cummings made about Health Secretary Matt Hancockâs honesty. In addition, Cummings has been asked to provide text exchanges he had with the prime minister, as well as numerous ministers, officials and journalists. The pair had asked for the evidence to be provided by 4 June to allow it to be studied by their joint inquiry on coronavirus, ahead of Hancockâs appearance tomorrow. But âno evidence has been received to date from Dominic Cummingsâ by the Committee. While older people have been the most at risk from coronavirus itself, the young have disproportionately suffered from its economic fallout, according to unemployment figures. The unemployment rate among young people was 14.6% in 2020 but 5.2% for over 25s, according to the International Labour Organization (ILO).

"This video can not be played Protecting trade flows east-west and north-south across the island of Ireland is ""easily doable"", says Boris Johnson The EU says its patience is ""wearing very thin"" with the UK in talks aimed at avoiding a post-Brexit trade war. Top EU official Maros Sefcovic said the UK must start checking goods entering Northern Ireland, as agreed in the 2019 Brexit ""divorce"" settlement. The UK says it is ready to ignore the rules to prevent further disruption - sparking threats of EU retaliation. Boris Johnson said a solution that protects trade flows and the peace process was ""easily doable"". And he dismissed talk of a trade war with the EU, saying he was ""not worried"" it would overshadow the G7 summit. The prime minister is in Cornwall, where he will host the leaders of the world's richest nations, including US President Joe Biden, who is said to have ""deep"" concerns that a UK-EU trade row could endanger peace in Northern Ireland. Why is there a UK-EU row over sausages? Don't imperil NI peace, Biden to warn UK and EU EU to begin legal action over NI Protocol 'breach' Asked about this, Mr Johnson said everyone needed to be ""absolutely clear"" that the purpose of the Northern Ireland protocol - the part of the Brexit deal at the centre of the row - was to ""uphold the Belfast Good Friday Agreement, to make sure that we keep the balance in relationships in Northern Ireland"". He said he was ""optimistic"" a solution could be found that ""protects the peace process, but also guarantees the economic and territorial integrity of the whole United Kingdom"". Lord Frost (L) has been discussing border issues with his EU counterpart Maros Sefcovic in central London Talks between Mr Sefcovic - a vice-president of the European Commission - and UK Brexit minister Lord Frost broke up earlier without agreement. Mr Sefcovic said he was ""positive we can find a solution"" but added: ""Our patience really is wearing very, very thin, and therefore we have to assess all options we have at our disposal."" This could include legal action, arbitration or retaliatory trade measures such as tariffs, he explained. He said ""trust"" had to be restored between the two sides, after the UK had broken the terms of the 2019 Northern Ireland protocol. A key flashpoint is a looming ban on the export of sausages and other chilled meats from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) no longer follows EU rules but Northern Ireland does - because it shares a land border with the Republic of Ireland, an EU member. EU food safety rules do not allow chilled meat products to enter its market from non-members like the UK. Frozen meat is not covered by the rules. In January, the two sides agreed a six month ""grace"" period to allow companies to set up alternative supply chains, but that runs out at the end of June. The UK has already held back from carrying out full checks on supermarket goods and parcels moving from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, prompting the EU to accuse the UK of undermining the protocol and tobegin legal proceedings. Mr Sefcovic said: ""If the UK were to take further unilateral action in the coming weeks the EU will not be shy in acting swiftly, firmly and resolutely to ensure the UK abides by its international obligations."" A UK source close to the negotiations said: ""Nobody wants to get into a trade war or anything close to it."" It was ""much better to find agreed ways forward"", added the source, and ""the people in Northern Ireland want solutions not threats"". ""But unfortunately we have got used to living in an atmosphere where there are threats."" Asked by ITV's Robert Peston if the UK would take unilateral action, Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis said ""we're not at that stage yet but we've said we will keep all options open."" There's a clash of cultures at the heart of this increasingly serious dispute. The EU is a union of laws and rules - and once it has an agreement it tends to stick to the details. The British government, on the other hand, decided to kick some of the details down the road in its desire to ""Get Brexit Done"". But those details never went away, and now they are threatening to provoke another crisis in Britain's relationship with Europe, and to destabilise Northern Ireland. During the 2019 general election campaign Boris Johnson said there would be no checks on goods moving in either direction between Great Britain and Northern Ireland as a result of his Brexit deal, even though official documents at the time made clear that there would be. Now his government says the EU needs to show more flexibility, that it's being too legalistic. The practicalities of implementing the Northern Ireland Protocol in full are certainly pretty challenging. Northern Ireland's chief vet recently told Assembly members in Belfast that it would require more checks on food than are done in the whole of the EU. And he only has 12 vets. The EU says it is prepared to be flexible, but says the UK cannot walk away from its legal obligations. Both sides talk about ""considering all our options"" if a compromise can't be found. In public at least, it's hard to see where the common ground lies. Mr Sefcovic said the EU had offered a temporary solution to the chilled meats row, ahead of a comprehensive trade deal, but he said the UK was not prepared to accept it because it would involve signing up to EU food standards. ""Ideology prevails over what is good for the people of Northern Ireland,"" he added. Northern Irish ports such as Larne have seen additional border checks under the protocol Speaking after his meeting with Mr Sefcovic, Lord Frost said the protocol was ""being implemented in a way which is causing disruption in Northern Ireland and we had some pretty frank and honest discussions about that situation"". ""There weren't any breakthroughs, there weren't any breakdowns either and we are going to carry on talking,"" he added. ""What we really now need to do is very urgently find some solutions, which support the Belfast Good Friday Agreement, Support the peace process in Northern Ireland and allow things to return to normal."" Government 'knew NI Protocol was bad deal' Can sea border âteething problemsâ be solved? Lord Frost said the EU was insisting that the two sides ""operate the protocol in an extremely purist way"" and he did not see any problem with continuing to allow exports of chilled meats. ""We don't see what risk is caused to Northern Ireland if chilled meats are imported there from GB."" Northern Ireland's deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill - who also took part in the meeting - challenged the UK government to ""honour its commitments"" on the Brexit protocol. ""Certainly there's a frustration that the British government have signed up to this agreement, however they have failed to bring forward ways to implement the Protocol in its entirety,"" she added.

"More than a million coronavirus vaccine bookings were made on the NHS website yesterday - a record total The NHS chief executive compares the demand, on the first day all 25 to 29-year-olds could book, to the rush for Glastonbury tickets The UK has recorded another 7,540 coronavirus cases, the highest number reported in a day since 26 February About 8 in 10 adults in the UK had antibodies to coronavirus by 17 May, according to the Office for National Statistics Asked about a possible delay to the 21 June easing of restrictions, Boris Johnson says there are arguments being made both ways He says data is still being studied, including on how much impact the ""phenomenal"" vaccine rollout is having The PM's former adviser Dominic Cummings has been asked for evidence of claims he made to MPs a fortnight ago Cummings questioned Health Secretary Matt Hancockâs honesty when quizzed about the handling of early stages of the pandemic The US eases travel restrictions for 61 countries as the roll-out of coronavirus vaccines continues - but not the UK France is easing some of its lockdown measures in time for the summer Edited by James Clarke We're ending our live coverage today, thanks for
joining us. Weâll be back tomorrow morning with more coronavirus news. Todayâs updates
were brought to you by Victoria Lindrea, Jennifer Meierhans, Joshua Nevett, Ella
Willis and Katie Wright. The page was edited by James Clarke. We'll shortly be pausing our live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic. Here's a round-up of the main headlines today: This video can not be played Free Hugs: Does Covid mean the end of hugging strangers? The Covid pandemic put a stop to the Free Hugs movement - with social distancing guidelines and restrictions in place in countries around the world. The group used to offer hugs to strangers every weekend - but they say any decision to relax social distancing should be treated with caution. BBC health reporter, Laura Foster, spoke to some members of Free Hugs UK about the importance of hugs and when they might be able to freely hug again. The Penta Hotel in Reading's Oxford Rd opened as a quarantine facility on 29 April A local council has called on the government to shut a quarantine hotel in Reading after a total of 44 positive cases of Covid-19 were identified among residents and staff. Reading Council says it is ""unconvinced"" the outbreak is under control or that robust safety measures are in place. The quarantine facility, run by the Department of Health and Social Care, opened on 29 April. Reading Borough Council says it was notified of the first Covid outbreak on 9 May. The local authority says cases have spread ""between guests, and hotel and security staff"". It says it believes at least three cases in the community have been directly linked to the hotel's outbreak and the spread ""could have been avoided had the correct safety procedures been in place"" at the outset. The majority of the positive cases have been identified as the Delta variant. The Department for Health and Social Care has been approached for comment. Prime Minister Boris Johnson says itâs
too early to say if England's lockdown can end on 21 June as data on whether
the vaccine rollout offers enough protection from the Delta variant is still being assessed. ""On Monday... we'll have a look
at where we are. I think what everybody can see very clearly is that cases are
going up, and in some places hospitalisations are going up,"" he says, speaking in Cornwall ahead of the G7 conference. ""What we need to assess is the
extent to which the vaccine rollout - which has been phenomenal - has built up
protection in the population in order for us to go ahead to the next stage. And
so that's what we'll be looking at."" As we reported earlier, the UK has recorded another 7,540 coronavirus cases over the past 24 hours - the highest number of daily cases reported since the end of February. Cases have risen dramatically over the past week, with a seven-day average of 5,984 - as the Delta variant continues to make its presence felt. But the number of cases is still far off the peak in January - and daily deaths remain low: on Wednesday, data showed a further six deaths within 28 days of a positive test - compared with 12 deaths a week ago. Scientists attribute the fall in both hospitalisations and deaths to the success of the vaccine rollout. More than half the adult population - 54.2% - are now fully vaccinated, while 77.3% have had one jab.   High school pupils in Scotland retuned to face-to-face lessons after the Easter holidays The number of Covid infections recorded among children in Scotland is now at the highest level it has been since the start of the outbreak. Weekly infections among children aged up to 14 reached 1,064 on 7 June - higher than the peak in early January, according to Public Health Scotland. While there is no evidence children are becoming seriously ill - with no significant rise in hospital admissions - growing numbers of pupils are off school. Provisional figures indicate 15,687 pupils were absent for Covid-related reasons at the end of last week, with overall attendance dropping to 87.8%. Data shows a four-fold increase in cases among children under 15, but infection rates are still considerably higher among young adults and older teenagers. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said Scotland will move quickly to vaccinate 12-15 year olds if recommended by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation. Read the full story. A number of government reviews are currently under way looking at Covid-19 measures in England. Their findings will inform wider policy forstep four of the roadmap plan,external- which will happen on 21 June at the earliest, butcould be delayed past then. What
reviews are there?  Find out morehere. Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics The number of people in
hospital with coronavirus is on the rise again and reached 1,024 on Monday 7 June,
rising above 1,000 for the first time since mid-May. Back then, numbers were
falling and they reached a low point of just under 870 on 27 May. But they have risen by nearly
20% in the 11 days since then. This is still far below the
peak in Januaryâs wave when nearly 40,000 people were in hospital with
coronavirus in the UK. And people in the NHS say the cases theyâre seeing now are less serious than in previous waves. But they underline the inevitable
impact of the rising case numbers that we have been seeing in the UK. The rises in people in
hospital are driven by increasing numbers of people in hospital in Scotland and
the North West of England, the region and nation where cases have been rising
for the longest in the UK in the early stages of this third wave. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Traffic control measures have been imposed in parts of Guangzhou in an attempt to limit the spread of the virus In the past 24
hours, China has confirmed eight new domestic symptomatic cases of Covid-19,
all in southern Guangdong province. This is the
only area of mainland China where there is currently an outbreak; 164 people
are currently in hospital across the province. Most patients are in the
populous city of Guangzhou, which along with the nearby city of Foshan and
Wuchuan County, has local lockdowns in place. Guangzhou is
one of Chinaâs biggest cities, and as cases of mutant variants have been
detected, there have been some fears that it could see a large-scale outbreak,
like those seen in the cities ofWuhanorShijiazhuang. However, huge
vaccine uptake has helped China avoid a third wave â more than 800 million
vaccine doses have now been administeredacross the country,externaland recent media reports have suggested new patients have exhibited mild or no
symptoms. Even with
triple-digit cases, tens of thousands of students have still been able to sit
their university entrance exams in Guangzhou this week. This would have been
unthinkable during earlier outbreaks â Chinaâs approach to date has been to
swiftly lock down communities and order mass testing drives, allowing people
very little room for manoeuvre. But vaccination uptake has helped China relax
its Covid-19 regulations. Local governments have been increasingly finding safe
ways for events to go ahead, rather than simply cancelling them. It is still
not clear how this latest outbreak began. Health officials in Guangzhou say the genetic sequencing of cases in the city show a 98% similarity,
suggesting they are all linked to the same chain of transmission. A local
health commission official tells the official CCTV broadcasterâmore investigation is needed to identify patient zeroâ,external. Philippa RoxbyHealth reporter, BBC News There are still many unknowns about the Delta variant, first
detected in India, which is causing a worrying rise in cases and hospital
admissions in some areas of the UK. Overall, the virus is still at low levels â but there is now
clear concern from scientists that a third wave could be on its way. Prof Neil Ferguson, virus modeller from Imperial College
London, tells journalists the size and scale of that wave depends on how
effective the vaccines are at protecting against illness from the Delta
variant. That still isnât clear and more data needs to be collected. The Delta variant could be anywhere from 40-80% more
transmissible, he says, with 60% his âbest estimateâ. âBut thereâs still an enormous amount of uncertainty,â he
adds. In the meantime, administering as many second doses as
quickly as possible is a priority - to give people the best possible protection. As for easing final restrictions on 21 June, there is
caution from Prof Ferguson. Delaying unlocking, he says, would allow more people to be
vaccinated - and reduce the size of a third wave. But the final say rests with
the government.  Vaccines
should be prioritised for high-risk areas where there are a large number of cases
of the Delta variant, say a group of MPs and council leaders from north-west England. In a letter
to the prime minister, the group - which includes Blackburn MP Kate Hollern and
leader of Manchester City Council Sir Richard Leese - say the challenges
posed by the Delta variant are different to those faced by the country a few
months ago. Greater Manchester and Lancashire accounts for 90% of the areas with the highest infection rates in England, according to last week's data. The local leaders say with the vast majority of the most vulnerable fully vaccinated,
the âfocus should now shiftâ to areas where the likelihood of contracting the
Delta variant is greatest. The
letter calls on the government to ensure vaccines are making their way to
areas âthat need them mostâ, adding: âDoing so would not only benefit our local areas, but the national effort to contain
the spread of the Delta variant.â Around three million text messages are being sent out over this week to ask 25 to 29-year-olds to book their coronavirus vaccine through the national booking service. GPs are also set to urge the newly-eligible groups to come forward over the coming days. Text invitations, which do not expire, should appear as an alert from ""NHSvaccine"" and include a web link to the NHS website to reserve an appointment. When invited, people will be able to book at one of the 1,600 vaccination centres, pharmacies or GP sites across the country that are available through the national booking service. Vaccination centres are also popping up in places such as mosques, museums and sports stadiums. Who can book the vaccine now? Find out here. The UKâs latest
figures also show the number of people to have had one vaccine dose is now
40.7 million, while the number who have received both doses is 28.5 million. That's 77.3%
of the adult population who have had one jab, and 54.2% who have had two jabs. The UK
has recorded another 7,540 coronavirus cases,according to the latest government figures.,external That is
the highest number of daily cases reported since 26 February. The
seven-day average for cases is up by 66%, amid concerns the Delta variant is
fuelling a rise in infections. There
have also been a further six deaths within 28 days of a positive test. Today's figures compare with 4,330 cases a week ago and 12 deaths. We've got more now on the record day for vaccination bookings. When vaccine appointments opened to 25 to 29-year-olds yesterday the initial surge prompted 100,000 bookings an hour between 07:00 BST and midday, according to NHS figures. NHS chief executive Sir Simon Stevens labels it a ""Glastonbury-style"" rush for jabs - a reference to the traditional stampede to book tickets for the music festival. He says: ""The obvious enthusiasm of younger adults to get their jab has blown out of the water the suggestion that people in their 20s might not come forward to protect themselves and their loved ones."" Hitting one million bookings in a day ""sends a fantastic signal"", says Dr Emily Lawson, lead for the NHS Covid Vaccination Programme. She says it shows ""the Covid-19 vaccine is something that all of us - no matter our age â can value and be excited by and most importantly should get, when our opportunity comes."" Coronavirus vaccine bookings on the NHS website reached a record high of more than one million yesterday. It's first time daily appointments made through the national booking service have topped the million mark. As vaccines were opened up to people aged 25 to 29 yesterday morning, a total of 1,082,596 first and second dose slots were snapped up across the day online and by phone. That's about 45,000 an hour on average and more than 750 every minute, over the full 24 hours. The daily total for the National Booking Service yesterday means around four times as many slots were booked yesterday compared with the day before and the same day last week. Covid-19 testing in Northern Ireland's post-primary schools is to be extended to all pupils from this week until the end of the summer term. Previously, lateral flow device (LFD) testshad been made available to older students in years 12 to 14 onlywhere prevalence of Covid-19 tends to be higher. But for the final fortnight of term, the twice-weekly tests will be expanded to cover years eight to 11 - encompassing pupils aged 12 and upwards. NI Education Minister Peter Weir is urging schools ""to make use of their stock of LFD kits to extend the offer to all pupils in Years 8-11 for the remaining weeks of term"". ""The purpose of asymptomatic testing is to find individuals who are infected but do not realise it."" he explains. ""They can then be advised to isolate so reducing the risk of them unwittingly spreading infection in the school and elsewhere."" Read the full story. The chairs of two parliamentary select committees have written to Dominic Cummings asking him to provide documentary evidence for âseveral serious allegationsâ he made last month. In the letter, sent last week, Greg Clark and Jeremy Hunt asked for evidence for the claims Cummings made about Health Secretary Matt Hancockâs honesty. In addition, Cummings has been asked to provide text exchanges he had with the prime minister, as well as numerous ministers, officials and journalists. The pair had asked for the evidence to be provided by 4 June to allow it to be studied by their joint inquiry on coronavirus, ahead of Hancockâs appearance tomorrow. But âno evidence has been received to date from Dominic Cummingsâ by the Committee. While older people have been the most at risk from coronavirus itself, the young have disproportionately suffered from its economic fallout, according to unemployment figures. The unemployment rate among young people was 14.6% in 2020 but 5.2% for over 25s, according to the International Labour Organization (ILO). ""The young jobless have been stuck in a Covid-19 limbo-land,"" says Sher Verick, from ILO.

"Viewing a partial eclipse means observing the Sun and needs special care Shetland is expected to have the best view in the UK of a solar eclipse on Thursday, experts have said. Some parts of the world will see the annular eclipse or so-called ring of fire in full, but from the UK there will be a partial solar eclipse. Shetland is expected to have a 39% obscuration, which indicates how much of the Sun's disc area is covered as a percentage. It is followed by Lochinver at 36.8%, Inverness at 35% and Edinburgh at 31%. The spectacle will begin shortly after 10:00 and will last for more than two hours, with the quality of view dependent on clear skies. The locationalfigures have been detailed by the BBC's Sky at Night Magazine,external, ahead of Thursday morning's eclipse. They show that Belfast is to have obscuration of 30%, with Newcastle seeing 28%, Penzance is at just under 22%, and London is expected to see 20% obscuration. Unst-based organisation Wild Skies Shetland, which organises sky-related events, is looking forward to the spectacle. Crowds in Asia watch 'ring of fire' solar eclipse When is the next solar eclipse in my country? Secretary Jane Macaulay said: ""The further north you are, the more of the sun will be obscured by the moon. ""Watching from Unst, the most northerly island in the UK, folk will be in the best position in the whole country to observe the phenomenon."" Protective glasses allow a safe glimpse of the spectacle Steve Mathieson, the VisitScotland development manager in Shetland, said that before Covid-19 there had been an increase in the popularity of astro tourism - the interest of tourists in space-related activities such as dark sky observation, astronomy, astro-photography and space technology. Viewing the eclipse - when the moon moves between the earth and the Sun, causing the moon to cast its shadow over the earth directly - with the naked eye can be hazardous. Eclipse glasses that allow the Sun to be viewed safely can be used, or it can be done indirectly using a projection device such as a pinhole camera. The annular solar eclipse will be visible in the far northern hemisphere, sweeping from northern Canada across Greenland and the North Pole before ending over Siberia. Those viewing from the UK will be able to see a late morning partial solar eclipse because they will be thousands of miles south of the path of annularity enjoyed by eclipse-watchers further north.

"The G7 Leaders (L-R): Boris Johnson, Yoshihide Suga, Emmanuel Macron, Mario Draghi, Justin Trudeau, Angela Merkel and Joe Biden A sculpture of the G7 leaders shaped likeMount Rushmoremade of electronic waste has been erected in Cornwall ahead of the G7 Summit. It has been named ""Mount Recyclemore"" and bids to highlight the damage caused by the disposal of electronic devices. Sculptor Joe Rush said he hoped it would show they needed to be made more easily reusable or recyclable.

"Andrew Lloyd Webber is the owner of seven London theatres Andrew Lloyd Webber has said he is determined to open his theatres on 21 June, even if he risks being arrested. The impresario's West End production of Cinderella is scheduled to begin previews on 25 June, four days after so-called ""freedom day"". ""We are going to open, come hell or high water,""he told the Telegraph,external. The government has said it will make a judgement soon on whether to proceed with the lifting of lockdown restrictions on 21 June. According to reports, that date may be pushed back by the government due to concerns over the impact of Covid-19 variant. Theatres are currently able to operate with with reduced capacities and socially distanced audiences. Lord Lloyd-Webber has previously insisted that productions like his large-scale musicals are ""impossible"" under those restrictions. A defiant announcement for Cinderella at the Gillian Lynne Theatre in London The 73-year-old told the Telegraph he is prepared to be arrested if authorities try to intervene in his reopening plans. ""We will say 'come to the theatre and arrest us,'"" the Evita and Phantom of the Opera composer is quoted as saying. The theatre mogul said he may have to sell his six West End venues if the government does not relax its restrictions. The pandemic has had a catastrophic financial impact on the theatre industry and many have remained closed despite the ease in Covid-19 measures. ""If the government ignore their own science, we have the mother of all legal cases against them,"" Lord Lloyd-Webber continued. ""If Cinderella couldn't open we'd go, 'look, either we go to law about it or you'll have to compensate us.""' Speaking to Radio 4's Today programme on Wednesday, he called on the government to stop ""penalising"" the live music and theatre sector. ""We can open safely,"" the impresario insisted. ""Please, please let us get open."" He claimed that recent pilot events had shown there was ""no chance of infection being passed... provided certain protocols are maintained"". Five ways to avoid catching coronavirus indoors Scientists tell us what they will (and won't) be doing The government has yet to publish the results of its test event programme, which included having a live audience at last month's Brit Awards. Audience members at the Brits, held at London's O2 arena, were not required to wear masks or socially distance as they had all been required to take a Covid test. Lord Lloyd-Webber said he was happy for his audiences to wear masks at his shows and for so-called vaccine passports to be used. Carrie Hope Fletcher will play the title role in Emerald Fennell's reworking He said he had spoken to ""leading counsel"" who had told him it would be ""neither rational nor proportionate"" for the government to ""stop us from going forward."" ""My feeling is I've gone through everything with the counsel,"" he continued. ""I've gone through [everything] about the theatre itself, which has no recirculated air, the incoming air passes through filters completely. ""There are 30 places in the theatre where the spread of air comes from. I'm not a mechanic, but we have the CO2 [carbon dioxide] monitoring that shows that the air is purer in there than it is outside."" An organisation representing venues that open at night, such as pubs, nightclubs and live music venues, has said it is also considering taking action should the government delay its lockdown relaxing measures. ""The decision to delay will leave us no other option but to challenge the government aggressively,"" said Michael Kill, CEO of the Night Time Industries Association (NTIA). Cinderella was due to open last August but is now scheduled to have its opening night at the Gillian Lynne Theatre on 14 July. Lord Lloyd-Webber also has plans to re-launch his West End productions of The Phantom of the Opera and Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat. Communities secretary Robert Jenrick said on Wednesday he ""completely sympathised"" with the impresario and those in the theatre sector. ""We want to get them open, we are doing pilots,"" he told Sky News. ""We want to get those theatres open so great new productions like Cinderella can open. ""But you have just got a few more days to wait until the judgment that the Prime Minister is going to make on the basis of the data."" When asked if Lord Lloyd-Webber should be arrested if he does open theatres without restrictions relaxing, Mr Jenrick said: ""We all have to abide by the rules."" Julian Knight, the chair of the DCMS (Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport) Committee said: ""It is very frustrating for the live events industry as we can see from Lord Lloyd-Webber's comments though clearly I wouldn't support anyone breaking the law. ""With the 21 June reopening on a knife edge the government needs to be absolutely upfront about the results of its pilot events and how they feed into decision-making.""

"Sir Kevan Collins said the funding for school recovery ""does not come close"" to what was needed The phrase ""build back better"" used to be stuck in every government statement like an irritating ring tone you couldn't escape. And helping schools in England to recover after so much disruption caused by the pandemic was one of the top priorities. But the chief architect of the recovery plan, Sir Kevan Collins, has walked out over a lack of ""credible"" funding, suggesting that he wouldn't put his name to building on the cheap. If not a poundshop, then a Â£22 shop, which he said would be the amount of catch-up cash the average primary school would receive per pupil per year. ""The support announced by government so far does not come close to meeting the scale of the challenge, and is why I have no option but to resign from my post,"" said Sir Kevan, as he quit his high-profile role. School catch-up tsar quits over lack of funding PM vows more school catch-up cash amid funding row What students want from catch-up plans Sport and music 'should be part of pupil catch-up' It was a damning response from someone highly respected and with decades of experience. The only thing not straightforward about Sir Kevan is how he spells Kevan. So what happens next? Does that scupper the government's recovery plan in one of its key areas? As Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said, the Â£1.4bn promised over three years is a ""pretty hefty amount"". So what was wrong with that? Weren't the head teachers who called it a ""damp squib"" expecting far too much? Boris Johnson said more money would be ""coming down the track"" The tutoring plan announced will presumably go ahead. Sir Kevan has continued to back it - but he saw the tutoring cash as an appetising starter rather than the nourishing main course. It will be aimed at disadvantaged children who are most likely to have fallen behind, but it will not be available for all pupils. Many will not get any tutoring from this. ""It is not a panacea,"" Sir Kevan said. The much bigger what-happens-next question is about the much wider, more expensive investment in schools that Sir Kevan had proposed. ""The stakes here are very high. Namely the future prosperity and health of our children,"" said Sir Peter Lampl, founder of the Sutton Trust social mobility charity. He said that Sir Kevan was right to walk away ""given the derisory amount"" being offered for catch-up. The much bigger plan, which failed to turn up on Wednesday, was about extra hours in school. There were some mixed messages about this - with the education secretary talking about a longer day, such as for schools which might finish at 14:45. Decisions about schools are caught up in wider debates about regional lockdowns But Sir Kevan's plan called for a major injection of cash to extend the school day by 30 minutes, in a flexible and fully-funded way, which might be for extra lessons or for sports or arts clubs or other ""enrichment"" activities. This was the big ticket part of the plan and would have run for three years, with the aim of recovering lost learning and stopping the disruption of the pandemic becoming a long-term disadvantage. It would give schools funding for extra staffing and services, without putting extra pressure on their teachers. It had echoes of the ""extended schools"" scheme, rolled out under Tony Blair's Labour government. With Sir Kevan's resignation, the government will now have to decide what to do with the blueprint left on their desks as the door slammed. Apart from the core questions of helping children to catch up, there will be other factors to consider. Like money. And it will become part of the arm-wrestling over the next spending review. The prime minister promised more funding would be ""coming down the track"", but without any specific commitment. As well as this possible Â£15bn bid for catch-up cash, the Treasury will also be thinking about another big education project - the funding of student finance for people on vocational courses. There are still many big questions about how this expanded loan system is going to operate and how much it will cost. There's also the issue of timing and changing moods. The school catch-up tsar was appointed in February, when many pupils were studying at home, and there was huge pressure to show a pathway to a recovery. In the autumn, when funding plans are next considered, the biggest recent education issue is likely to have been another round of arguments over replacement exam results. Will the political heat have left the catch-up debate? Will there be more appetite to get back to normal rather than push for more upheaval and new initiatives? Parents might also have reservations about longer school days. Robert Halfon, chair of the education select committee, argues that education recovery has to remain a top priority - and the government needs to ""find the money from the back of the sofa"". This has to be more than a patch-up effort, he argues. ""We need some radical thinking, some thinking out of the box, a proper long-term plan,"" he said. A Downing Street spokesman said: ""The prime minister is hugely grateful to Sir Kevan for his work in helping pupils catch up and recover from the effects of the pandemic. ""The government will continue to focus on education recovery and making sure no child is left behind with their learning, with over Â£3bn committed for catch-up so far.""

"Sir Kevan Collins said the funding for school recovery ""does not come close"" to what was needed The education recovery commissioner for England, Sir Kevan Collins, has resigned in a row over the lack of ""credible"" Covid catch-up funding. Sir Kevan took on the role as catch-up tsar in February to develop a long-term plan to help pupils make up for lost learning during the pandemic. But on Wednesday he stepped down saying the government's funding for the plan ""falls far short of what is needed"". Head teachers labelled the Â£1.4bn cash over three years as a ""damp squib"". The Education Policy Institute had calculated that a catch-up funding recovery would need Â£13.5bn - and Sir Kevan was reported as having put forward plans costing Â£15bn. The government's proposal represents Â£50 per pupil per year - and Sir Kevan wrote to the prime minister saying: ""I do not believe it is credible that a successful recovery can be achieved with a programme of support of this size."" A Downing Street spokesman said: ""The prime minister is hugely grateful to Sir Kevan for his work in helping pupils catch up and recover from the effects of the pandemic. ""The government will continue to focus on education recovery and making sure no child is left behind with their learning, with over Â£3bn committed for catch up so far."" Earlier on Wednesday, the government announced an extra Â£1.4bn over three years for education recovery, in addition to the Â£1.7bn already announced. This included Â£1bn for 100 million hours of tutoring, aimed at disadvantaged pupils, and Â£250m for teacher training and development. PM vows more school catch-up cash amid funding row What students want from catch-up plans Sport and music 'should be part of pupil catch-up' The resignation statement from Sir Kevan,reported by The TES,external, said: ""A half-hearted approach risks failing hundreds of thousands of pupils. ""The support announced by government so far does not come close to meeting the scale of the challenge and is why I have no option but to resign from my post."" His resignation letter to Boris Johnson said: ""When we met last week, I told you that I do not believe it will be possible to deliver a successful recovery without significantly greater support than the government has to date indicated it intends to provide."" This video can not be played PM Boris Johnson says there will be more funding coming ""down the track"" This was a chaotic end to what should have been a showcase of the catch-up plan for England's schools. The widely-respected adviser brought in to deliver the plans walked out in protest - turning a story that should have been about extra money into an awkward debate about the lack of it. The resignation letter from Sir Kevan Collins to the prime minister makes plain that this should not have come as a surprise. ""When we met last week, I told you that I do not believe it will be possible to deliver a successful recovery without significantly greater support,"" wrote Sir Kevan. Boris Johnson and Education Secretary Gavin Williamson had spent the day trying to keep the plans afloat, presenting them as a ""next step"" with more to follow - after strong criticism that the funding was only a tenth of what was required. But Sir Kevan's resignation has fired a torpedo at the government's contention that school recovery is one of its top priorities. Earlier, head teachers had said they were ""hugely disappointed"" by the announcement after expectations of a much bigger set of proposals. Paul Whiteman, leader of the National Association of Head Teachers, described it as a ""damp squib"" and said ""education recovery cannot be done on the cheap"". As such, he said: ""It is completely understandable that Sir Kevan chose not to become a pawn in whatever game the government is playing."" Mr Johnson then reassured schools and parents thatmore funding would be ""coming down the track"". Sir Kevan had been responsible for overseeing efforts to help schools in England recover from the disruption of the pandemic and lockdowns, which has seen pupils studying from home and exams cancelled over two academic years. He had reportedly called for funding for 100 extra hours of teaching per pupil - including for sports, music and the arts. But any extra teaching time, or longer school days, will now depend on getting further funding from the spending review. In a statement, Sir Kevan said a ""sustained and comprehensive programme of support"" would be needed and that ""more will be needed to meet the scale of the challenge"". Geoff Barton, head of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: ""We are sad but not surprised that Sir Kevan Collins is standing down. ""We know that Sir Kevan had much bolder and broader plans but that these required substantially more investment than the government was willing to provide. ""He's tried his hardest on behalf of children and young people, but, in the final analysis, the political will just wasn't there to support him."" Labour's shadow education secretary Kate Green said the resignation was a ""damning indictment of the Conservatives' education catch-up plan"". ""He was brought in by Boris Johnson because of his experience and expertise in education, but the government have thrown out his ideas as soon as it came to stumping up the money needed to deliver them."" Before taking up his post as tsar, Sir Kevan was head of the Education Endowment Foundation (EEF), which examines evidence for what works in education. As EEF chief executive, he ran an organisation that examined ideas for raising achievement, with the aim of breaking the link between deprivation and poor outcomes in school. Sir Kevan has had a long career in education, as a former teacher who went on to be the director of children's services and chief executive of Tower Hamlets, east London.

"Boris Johnson has faced MPs questions in the Commons Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer asks Mr Johnson about the recent resignation of education catch up adviser Sir Kevan Collins Mr Johnson responds by saying the government is funding ""the biggest tutoring programme anywhere in the world"" Mr Starmer and the SNP's Ian Blackford both criticise government cuts to foreign aid The prime minister says the Conservatives have spent ""more than Labour ever did"" on foreign aid Former Tory PM Theresa May asks Boris Johnson about the lack of convictions after the Hillsborough disaster in 1989 Mr Johnson will meet US President Joe Biden in Cornwall later, ahead of the start of the G7 summit Talks between the EU-UK are being held in London to try to find a compromise to post-Brexit rules in Northern Ireland Edited by Johanna Howitt Thanks for following along with us today. The team with you today were Justin Parkinson, Owen Amos, Richard Morris, and Sinead Wilson. Hope you'll join us again next week. Reality Check Labour
leader Keir Starmer said the prime minister was âthe only G7 leader cutting his
aid budgetâ. In 2015, G7 countries
committed to spending 0.7% of their gross national income on international aid. The UK
achieved this but is planning to cut spending to 0.5% this year. Germany was above 0.7% in 2020. France was at 0.53% but has said
it will be increasing to 0.7% by 2025. Other
G7 members areat a lower level,external, including the United States (on 0.17%) The
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) says it cannot
confirm whether the UK is the only G7 country cutting foreign aid because it
doesnât have 2021 data for all seven countries. However, it was not
aware of any other country having announced cuts to its aid budgets. You can read more here. Jessica ParkerBBC political correspondent Sir Keir Starmer and Boris Johnson clashed over catch up funding for students following the resignation of education tsar Sir Kevan Collins. Sir Kevansaid the governmentâs plan fell âfar shortâ
of what was needed. Sir Keir agreed itâs not enough, while the prime minister passionately defends the plan. Regardless of any short term tussles,
there is likely to be a long term, broader tension; between calls to invest in
various sectors - to make up for lost time - versus a desire in some quarters
to get greater control over public spending. So what did we learn from today's session? Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Brexit minister Lord Frost Lord Frost has said that âthere werenât any breakthroughs, there werenât any breakdowns eitherâ in the talks with the EU Commission this morning.  He said the two sides would âcarry on talkingâ. In a short interview at the end of today's meeting, the UK's Brexit Minister said there had been âsome frank and honest discussionsâ about the situation in Northern Ireland, including on the movement of chilled meats from GB to NI. Responding to the suggestion that the UK knew that this was part of the Protocol it signed and needs to obey the rules it agreed, Frost said that âthe EU is insisting we operate the Protocol in an extremely purist way. ""The reality is that itâs a very balanced document designedâ¦ to deal with very sensitive politics in Northern Irelandâ he said. Jessica ParkerBBC political correspondent The issue of Brexit - and the Northern
Ireland protocol - emerged at Prime Ministerâs Questions. On one side a call
from the SDLP for the UK to come to terms with the EU in order to ensure fewer
checks. On the other, a Tory backbencher saying itâs the EU that needs to be
more pragmatic. Itâs a strong flavour of the arguments in play at todayâs talks
â between Lord Frost and his EU counterpart Maros Sefcovic - that
have been going on as we speak not far away from Parliament. Welsh Independent MP Jonathan Edwards asks the PM about the fate of the steel industry - will it be next to be betrayed by Brexit, he asks. The PM says Brexit offers export opportunities for Welsh farmers. Labour's Ian Lavery calls the government's catch up help for school children in England ""derisory"". He says the PM, who went to Eton and Oxford University, has a ""wonderfully privileged education background"" and asks him to explain the situation. Boris Johnson replies that this is wrong and that the scheme in place will make a ""huge difference"" to pupils. The issue of forced adoptions is raised by the Conservative Sir David Amess who says thousands of women suffered as a result, including those in his Southend constituency. Does the PM agree that an apology should be given and an acknowledgement that this was wrong, he asks. Johnson says he echoes the sentiments about those who have been affected. But he says the practices can't happen now because the law has been changed to protect people. The agencies involved have apologised he adds and that's  ""quite right too"". TheBBC has reported the stories of hundreds of womenforced to  give up their babies for adoption in the 1950s, 60s and 70s. Former prime minister Theresa May says in April 1989, 96 Liverpool fans ""were unlawfully killed at Hillsborough"" but nobody has ever been prosecuted for these deaths. She says the most recent trial collapsed because police evidence had been changed. She asks for the PM to look at the ramifications of this for future inquiries, and for the families of the Hillsborough 96. Boris Johnson says the families of those killed in the Hillsborough disaster ""have shown tremendous courage and determination"". He says ""we will always consider opportunities to consider the law and how it operates"" and will be considering this case. Labour's Andrew Gwynne asks about the resignation of advisers and recent criticisms over standards in government, saying: ""Does the prime minister wonder why this keeps happening to him?"" The PM responds that the government takes standards seriously. Conservative David Jones is up next and he also asks about the ongoing Brexit tensions with the EU. He says he notes that some in Brussels have problems with Lord Frost, who negotiated Britain's departure. Jones asks if the PM agrees with Frost's assessment that matters would be easier if the EU adopted a pragmatic rather than a purist approach to implementing the rules. Johnson says he agrees with Frost ""completely"" and thinks he is doing an ""outstanding job"". Labour MP Fabian Hamilton asks what is being done to avoid marriage and inheritance exploitation. He says an elderly constituent of his with late stage dementia was married by a man who befriended her. This, he says, wiped out her previous will, and meant her entire estate was left to him. Since this episode, he says he has been contacted by ""hundreds"" of other people whose family members have had the same thing happen to them. Boris Johnson says he will put Mr Hamilton in contact with the relevant people in government to deal with the issue. Labour's Barry Sheerman asks when the government's ""levelling-up"" agenda is ""going to start"", criticising the level of resources and quality of management of projects. The PM responds that people ""across the country"" are responding to a ""massive"" investment, transforming ""lives, hopes and opportunities"". Colum Eastwood from the SDLP raises the issue of how Brexit is playing out in Northern Ireland with the so-called Northern Ireland protocol. He asks why the PM is prioritising getting ""cheap, dodgy beef from Australia"" over the concerns of the people of Northern Ireland and reducing checks in the Irish sea. The PM says that is wrong. He says he is prioritising the rights and ability of the people of Northern Ireland to have access to goods from GB and is also protecting  the integrity of the UK. Tory MP Scott Benton calls the catch-up help for children in England a ""tutoring revolution"". The PM agrees, describing it as an ""evidence-based"" intervention, offering three to five months' worth of help. SNP Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, is up. He wishes all the best to Scotland's team for the forthcoming European football championship. He says the PM will walk in to the G7 summit as the only country to cut aid spending at a time when people need it most and is ""on the run from his own moral and legal responsibilities"". Will Johnson commit to a vote on ""his inhumane cuts"" he asks? The PM says people of this country are in favour of the balance the country is striking because we are in very difficult financial times and are already spending Â£10bn. But ""no-one is safe until all are safe"" says Blackford so we should support each other ""rather than walk away from those in need"". Johnson repeats his earlier comment that one in three of the vaccines being distributed around the world come from the Oxford AstraZeneca supply. For his final question, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer says the government is the only member of the G7 which is cutting its aid budget. He says business development groups are calling for leadership from the UK on overseas aid. He says the prospect of a new government in Israel is an opportunity to reset talks in the Middle East for Israelis and Palestinians. He says over 60 Palestinian children died in the latest conflict. ""For too many in Palestine"" the ""recognition of a sovereign state"" is too distant, he states. Boris Johnson says it's ""been a long standing"" view of the UK that the way to achieve peace in the Middle East is for a two state solution. ""Under this government, we continue to spend more than Labour ever did"" on overseas aid, he adds. In his fifth, and penultimate, question to the PM, Sir Keir Starmer says the attainment gap will rise under the government's plans, accusing Boris Johnson of being ""all over the place"". Turnng to this week's G7 summit, Sir Keir says the UK must lead a ""truly global effort"" to increase Covid vaccinations. Johnson replies that this is ""indeed"" happening already, and that one in three doses distributed around the world are of Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine. Â© 2025 BBC.

Here's a round-up of the main headlines today: This video can not be played Free Hugs: Does Covid mean the end of hugging strangers? The Covid pandemic put a stop to the Free Hugs movement - with social distancing guidelines and restrictions in place in countries around the world. The group used to offer hugs to strangers every weekend - but they say any decision to relax social distancing should be treated with caution. BBC health reporter, Laura Foster, spoke to some members of Free Hugs UK about the importance of hugs and when they might be able to freely hug again. The Penta Hotel in Reading's Oxford Rd opened as a quarantine facility on 29 April A local council has called on the government to shut a quarantine hotel in Reading after a total of 44 positive cases of Covid-19 were identified among residents and staff. Reading Council says it is ""unconvinced"" the outbreak is under control or that robust safety measures are in place. The quarantine facility, run by the Department of Health and Social Care, opened on 29 April. Reading Borough Council says it was notified of the first Covid outbreak on 9 May. The local authority says cases have spread ""between guests, and hotel and security staff"". It says it believes at least three cases in the community have been directly linked to the hotel's outbreak and the spread ""could have been avoided had the correct safety procedures been in place"" at the outset. The majority of the positive cases have been identified as the Delta variant. The Department for Health and Social Care has been approached for comment. Prime Minister Boris Johnson says itâs
too early to say if England's lockdown can end on 21 June as data on whether
the vaccine rollout offers enough protection from the Delta variant is still being assessed. ""On Monday... we'll have a look
at where we are. I think what everybody can see very clearly is that cases are
going up, and in some places hospitalisations are going up,"" he says, speaking in Cornwall ahead of the G7 conference. ""What we need to assess is the
extent to which the vaccine rollout - which has been phenomenal - has built up
protection in the population in order for us to go ahead to the next stage. And
so that's what we'll be looking at."" As we reported earlier, the UK has recorded another 7,540 coronavirus cases over the past 24 hours - the highest number of daily cases reported since the end of February. Cases have risen dramatically over the past week, with a seven-day average of 5,984 - as the Delta variant continues to make its presence felt. But the number of cases is still far off the peak in January - and daily deaths remain low: on Wednesday, data showed a further six deaths within 28 days of a positive test - compared with 12 deaths a week ago. Scientists attribute the fall in both hospitalisations and deaths to the success of the vaccine rollout. More than half the adult population - 54.2% - are now fully vaccinated, while 77.3% have had one jab.   High school pupils in Scotland retuned to face-to-face lessons after the Easter holidays The number of Covid infections recorded among children in Scotland is now at the highest level it has been since the start of the outbreak. Weekly infections among children aged up to 14 reached 1,064 on 7 June - higher than the peak in early January, according to Public Health Scotland. While there is no evidence children are becoming seriously ill - with no significant rise in hospital admissions - growing numbers of pupils are off school. Provisional figures indicate 15,687 pupils were absent for Covid-related reasons at the end of last week, with overall attendance dropping to 87.8%. Data shows a four-fold increase in cases among children under 15, but infection rates are still considerably higher among young adults and older teenagers. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said Scotland will move quickly to vaccinate 12-15 year olds if recommended by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation. Read the full story. A number of government reviews are currently under way looking at Covid-19 measures in England.

hospital with coronavirus is on the rise again and reached 1,024 on Monday 7 June,
rising above 1,000 for the first time since mid-May. Back then, numbers were
falling and they reached a low point of just under 870 on 27 May. But they have risen by nearly
20% in the 11 days since then. This is still far below the
peak in Januaryâs wave when nearly 40,000 people were in hospital with
coronavirus in the UK. And people in the NHS say the cases theyâre seeing now are less serious than in previous waves. But they underline the inevitable
impact of the rising case numbers that we have been seeing in the UK. The rises in people in
hospital are driven by increasing numbers of people in hospital in Scotland and
the North West of England, the region and nation where cases have been rising
for the longest in the UK in the early stages of this third wave. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Traffic control measures have been imposed in parts of Guangzhou in an attempt to limit the spread of the virus In the past 24
hours, China has confirmed eight new domestic symptomatic cases of Covid-19,
all in southern Guangdong province. This is the
only area of mainland China where there is currently an outbreak; 164 people
are currently in hospital across the province. Most patients are in the
populous city of Guangzhou, which along with the nearby city of Foshan and
Wuchuan County, has local lockdowns in place. Guangzhou is
one of Chinaâs biggest cities, and as cases of mutant variants have been
detected, there have been some fears that it could see a large-scale outbreak,
like those seen in the cities ofWuhanorShijiazhuang. However, huge
vaccine uptake has helped China avoid a third wave â more than 800 million
vaccine doses have now been administeredacross the country,externaland recent media reports have suggested new patients have exhibited mild or no
symptoms. Even with
triple-digit cases, tens of thousands of students have still been able to sit
their university entrance exams in Guangzhou this week. This would have been
unthinkable during earlier outbreaks â Chinaâs approach to date has been to
swiftly lock down communities and order mass testing drives, allowing people
very little room for manoeuvre. But vaccination uptake has helped China relax
its Covid-19 regulations. Local governments have been increasingly finding safe
ways for events to go ahead, rather than simply cancelling them. It is still
not clear how this latest outbreak began. Health officials in Guangzhou say the genetic sequencing of cases in the city show a 98% similarity,
suggesting they are all linked to the same chain of transmission. A local
health commission official tells the official CCTV broadcasterâmore investigation is needed to identify patient zeroâ,external. Philippa RoxbyHealth reporter, BBC News There are still many unknowns about the Delta variant, first
detected in India, which is causing a worrying rise in cases and hospital
admissions in some areas of the UK. Overall, the virus is still at low levels â but there is now
clear concern from scientists that a third wave could be on its way. Prof Neil Ferguson, virus modeller from Imperial College
London, tells journalists the size and scale of that wave depends on how
effective the vaccines are at protecting against illness from the Delta
variant. That still isnât clear and more data needs to be collected. The Delta variant could be anywhere from 40-80% more
transmissible, he says, with 60% his âbest estimateâ. âBut thereâs still an enormous amount of uncertainty,â he
adds. In the meantime, administering as many second doses as
quickly as possible is a priority - to give people the best possible protection. As for easing final restrictions on 21 June, there is
caution from Prof Ferguson. Delaying unlocking, he says, would allow more people to be
vaccinated - and reduce the size of a third wave. But the final say rests with
the government.  Vaccines
should be prioritised for high-risk areas where there are a large number of cases
of the Delta variant, say a group of MPs and council leaders from north-west England. In a letter
to the prime minister, the group - which includes Blackburn MP Kate Hollern and
leader of Manchester City Council Sir Richard Leese - say the challenges
posed by the Delta variant are different to those faced by the country a few
months ago. Greater Manchester and Lancashire accounts for 90% of the areas with the highest infection rates in England, according to last week's data. The local leaders say with the vast majority of the most vulnerable fully vaccinated,
the âfocus should now shiftâ to areas where the likelihood of contracting the
Delta variant is greatest. The
letter calls on the government to ensure vaccines are making their way to
areas âthat need them mostâ, adding: âDoing so would not only benefit our local areas, but the national effort to contain
the spread of the Delta variant.â Around three million text messages are being sent out over this week to ask 25 to 29-year-olds to book their coronavirus vaccine through the national booking service. GPs are also set to urge the newly-eligible groups to come forward over the coming days. Text invitations, which do not expire, should appear as an alert from ""NHSvaccine"" and include a web link to the NHS website to reserve an appointment. When invited, people will be able to book at one of the 1,600 vaccination centres, pharmacies or GP sites across the country that are available through the national booking service. Vaccination centres are also popping up in places such as mosques, museums and sports stadiums. Who can book the vaccine now? Find out here. The UKâs latest
figures also show the number of people to have had one vaccine dose is now
40.7 million, while the number who have received both doses is 28.5 million. That's 77.3%
of the adult population who have had one jab, and 54.2% who have had two jabs. The UK
has recorded another 7,540 coronavirus cases,according to the latest government figures.,external That is
the highest number of daily cases reported since 26 February. The
seven-day average for cases is up by 66%, amid concerns the Delta variant is
fuelling a rise in infections. There
have also been a further six deaths within 28 days of a positive test. Today's figures compare with 4,330 cases a week ago and 12 deaths. We've got more now on the record day for vaccination bookings. When vaccine appointments opened to 25 to 29-year-olds yesterday the initial surge prompted 100,000 bookings an hour between 07:00 BST and midday, according to NHS figures. NHS chief executive Sir Simon Stevens labels it a ""Glastonbury-style"" rush for jabs - a reference to the traditional stampede to book tickets for the music festival. He says: ""The obvious enthusiasm of younger adults to get their jab has blown out of the water the suggestion that people in their 20s might not come forward to protect themselves and their loved ones."" Hitting one million bookings in a day ""sends a fantastic signal"", says Dr Emily Lawson, lead for the NHS Covid Vaccination Programme. She says it shows ""the Covid-19 vaccine is something that all of us - no matter our age â can value and be excited by and most importantly should get, when our opportunity comes."" Coronavirus vaccine bookings on the NHS website reached a record high of more than one million yesterday. It's first time daily appointments made through the national booking service have topped the million mark. As vaccines were opened up to people aged 25 to 29 yesterday morning, a total of 1,082,596 first and second dose slots were snapped up across the day online and by phone. That's about 45,000 an hour on average and more than 750 every minute, over the full 24 hours. The daily total for the National Booking Service yesterday means around four times as many slots were booked yesterday compared with the day before and the same day last week. Covid-19 testing in Northern Ireland's post-primary schools is to be extended to all pupils from this week until the end of the summer term. Previously, lateral flow device (LFD) testshad been made available to older students in years 12 to 14 onlywhere prevalence of Covid-19 tends to be higher. But for the final fortnight of term, the twice-weekly tests will be expanded to cover years eight to 11 - encompassing pupils aged 12 and upwards. NI Education Minister Peter Weir is urging schools ""to make use of their stock of LFD kits to extend the offer to all pupils in Years 8-11 for the remaining weeks of term"". ""The purpose of asymptomatic testing is to find individuals who are infected but do not realise it."" he explains. ""They can then be advised to isolate so reducing the risk of them unwittingly spreading infection in the school and elsewhere."" Read the full story. The chairs of two parliamentary select committees have written to Dominic Cummings asking him to provide documentary evidence for âseveral serious allegationsâ he made last month. In the letter, sent last week, Greg Clark and Jeremy Hunt asked for evidence for the claims Cummings made about Health Secretary Matt Hancockâs honesty. In addition, Cummings has been asked to provide text exchanges he had with the prime minister, as well as numerous ministers, officials and journalists. The pair had asked for the evidence to be provided by 4 June to allow it to be studied by their joint inquiry on coronavirus, ahead of Hancockâs appearance tomorrow. But âno evidence has been received to date from Dominic Cummingsâ by the Committee. While older people have been the most at risk from coronavirus itself, the young have disproportionately suffered from its economic fallout, according to unemployment figures. The unemployment rate among young people was 14.6% in 2020 but 5.2% for over 25s, according to the International Labour Organization (ILO). ""The young jobless have been stuck in a Covid-19 limbo-land,"" says Sher Verick, from ILO. ""This crisis has...not only led to the closure of businesses and job losses, but the lockdown measures have also severely constrained young people's ability to search for a job,"" he says.

Here's a round-up of the main headlines today: This video can not be played Free Hugs: Does Covid mean the end of hugging strangers? The Covid pandemic put a stop to the Free Hugs movement - with social distancing guidelines and restrictions in place in countries around the world. The group used to offer hugs to strangers every weekend - but they say any decision to relax social distancing should be treated with caution. BBC health reporter, Laura Foster, spoke to some members of Free Hugs UK about the importance of hugs and when they might be able to freely hug again. The Penta Hotel in Reading's Oxford Rd opened as a quarantine facility on 29 April A local council has called on the government to shut a quarantine hotel in Reading after a total of 44 positive cases of Covid-19 were identified among residents and staff. Reading Council says it is ""unconvinced"" the outbreak is under control or that robust safety measures are in place. The quarantine facility, run by the Department of Health and Social Care, opened on 29 April. Reading Borough Council says it was notified of the first Covid outbreak on 9 May. The local authority says cases have spread ""between guests, and hotel and security staff"". It says it believes at least three cases in the community have been directly linked to the hotel's outbreak and the spread ""could have been avoided had the correct safety procedures been in place"" at the outset. The majority of the positive cases have been identified as the Delta variant. The Department for Health and Social Care has been approached for comment. Prime Minister Boris Johnson says itâs
too early to say if England's lockdown can end on 21 June as data on whether
the vaccine rollout offers enough protection from the Delta variant is still being assessed. ""On Monday... we'll have a look
at where we are. I think what everybody can see very clearly is that cases are
going up, and in some places hospitalisations are going up,"" he says, speaking in Cornwall ahead of the G7 conference. ""What we need to assess is the
extent to which the vaccine rollout - which has been phenomenal - has built up
protection in the population in order for us to go ahead to the next stage. And
so that's what we'll be looking at."" As we reported earlier, the UK has recorded another 7,540 coronavirus cases over the past 24 hours - the highest number of daily cases reported since the end of February. Cases have risen dramatically over the past week, with a seven-day average of 5,984 - as the Delta variant continues to make its presence felt. But the number of cases is still far off the peak in January - and daily deaths remain low: on Wednesday, data showed a further six deaths within 28 days of a positive test - compared with 12 deaths a week ago. Scientists attribute the fall in both hospitalisations and deaths to the success of the vaccine rollout. More than half the adult population - 54.2% - are now fully vaccinated, while 77.3% have had one jab.   High school pupils in Scotland retuned to face-to-face lessons after the Easter holidays The number of Covid infections recorded among children in Scotland is now at the highest level it has been since the start of the outbreak. Weekly infections among children aged up to 14 reached 1,064 on 7 June - higher than the peak in early January, according to Public Health Scotland. While there is no evidence children are becoming seriously ill - with no significant rise in hospital admissions - growing numbers of pupils are off school.

"The government acted unlawfully when it awarded a Â£560,000 contract to a firm run by former colleagues of Michael Gove and the PM's adviser Dominic Cummings, the High Court has ruled. Mr Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, denied any favouritism had been shown to market research agency Public First. But the judge said a failure to consider other firms could be seen as suggesting a ""real danger"" of bias. Public First looked into public understanding of coronavirus. Campaigners took legal action against Mr Gove over the Cabinet Office's decision to use the company following the start of the pandemic last year. They also questioned the involvement of Mr Cummings, who worked in Downing Street until he quit as the prime minister's chief adviser last autumn. Lawyers for the Good Law Project argued that Mr Cummings wanted focus group and communications support services work to be given to Public First, whose founding partners were Rachel Wolf and James Frayne. In 2011, Mr Frayne became director of communications at the Department of Education, where he worked alongside Mr Cummings, who was a special adviser to Mr Gove, the then education secretary. Ms Wolf formerly worked as an adviser to Mr Gove and for Mr Cummings, and co-wrote the Conservatives' 2019 general election manifesto. Dominic Cummings said the amounts spent on focus groups had been ""trivial"" in the context of the Covid-19 crisis The government and Mr Cummings disputed the Good Law Project's claim. Delivering her ruling, Mrs Justice O'Farrell said: ""The claimant is entitled to a declaration that the decision of 5 June 2020 to award the contract to Public First gave rise to apparent bias and was unlawful."" She said: ""The defendant's failure to consider any other research agency, by reference to experience, expertise, availability or capacity, would lead a fair-minded and informed observer to conclude that there was a real possibility, or a real danger, that the decision-maker was biased."" But she also said: ""The fair-minded and informed observer would have appreciated that there was an urgent need or research through focus groups on effective communications in response to the Covid-19 crisis and that those research services were required immediately."" Mr Cummings had been ""uniquely placed, given his experience and expertise, to form a rapid view on which organisation might best be able to deliver those urgent requirements"", the judge said. The High Court rejected two other claims made against the government by the Good Law Project. The first was that the ""direct"" award of the contract to Public First was ""unnecessary"" because there were other firms who could potentially have done the work. The second was that giving it a six-month contract was ""disproportionate"" for the government's ""immediate"" needs - and that a shorter arrangement could have been followed by a ""competitive process"" for a longer contract. In his witness statement, Mr Cummings told the court: ""The country was facing an unprecedented national emergency. Thousands of lives were at stake, hundreds of billions of pounds were at stake. ""The extra money spent on doubling the focus groups and polling was essentially irrelevant in those circumstances. ""A few people did raise the question of how we could justify this as value for money. I responded that this was not the normal world, we were in a once-a-century pandemic and many thousands of pounds here was trivial if it helped us save lives and minimise economic destruction."" After the High Court ruling, he tweeted: ""When it became clear [the Department of Health, Public Health England and the Cabinet Office] weren't gathering vital data, I acted urgently. This data immediately helped key decisions and saved lives."" But Good Law Project director Jo Maugham said: ""This is not government for the public good - it is government for the good of friends of the Conservative Party."" Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner accused the government of acting ""immorally and unethically"". ""In the middle of a deadly pandemic not only were those at the heart of government giving out taxpayers' money to their friends and associates, they have wasted even more trying to cover it up,"" she added. However, a Public First spokesman said the company was ""deeply proud of the work we did in the early stages of the pandemic, which helped save lives"". He added: ""The judge rejected most of the Good Law Project's claims, not finding actual bias in the awarding of this work, nor any problems with the pace or scale of the award."" And the Cabinet Office said: ""The judgement makes clear that there was no suggestion of actual bias and that the decision to award the contract was not due to any personal or professional connections.""

"Sir Kevan Collins said the funding for school recovery ""does not come close"" to what was needed The phrase ""build back better"" used to be stuck in every government statement like an irritating ring tone you couldn't escape. And helping schools in England to recover after so much disruption caused by the pandemic was one of the top priorities. But the chief architect of the recovery plan, Sir Kevan Collins, has walked out over a lack of ""credible"" funding, suggesting that he wouldn't put his name to building on the cheap. If not a poundshop, then a Â£22 shop, which he said would be the amount of catch-up cash the average primary school would receive per pupil per year. ""The support announced by government so far does not come close to meeting the scale of the challenge, and is why I have no option but to resign from my post,"" said Sir Kevan, as he quit his high-profile role. School catch-up tsar quits over lack of funding PM vows more school catch-up cash amid funding row What students want from catch-up plans Sport and music 'should be part of pupil catch-up' It was a damning response from someone highly respected and with decades of experience. The only thing not straightforward about Sir Kevan is how he spells Kevan. So what happens next? Does that scupper the government's recovery plan in one of its key areas? As Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said, the Â£1.4bn promised over three years is a ""pretty hefty amount"". So what was wrong with that? Weren't the head teachers who called it a ""damp squib"" expecting far too much? Boris Johnson said more money would be ""coming down the track"" The tutoring plan announced will presumably go ahead. Sir Kevan has continued to back it - but he saw the tutoring cash as an appetising starter rather than the nourishing main course. It will be aimed at disadvantaged children who are most likely to have fallen behind, but it will not be available for all pupils. Many will not get any tutoring from this. ""It is not a panacea,"" Sir Kevan said. The much bigger what-happens-next question is about the much wider, more expensive investment in schools that Sir Kevan had proposed. ""The stakes here are very high. Namely the future prosperity and health of our children,"" said Sir Peter Lampl, founder of the Sutton Trust social mobility charity. He said that Sir Kevan was right to walk away ""given the derisory amount"" being offered for catch-up. The much bigger plan, which failed to turn up on Wednesday, was about extra hours in school. There were some mixed messages about this - with the education secretary talking about a longer day, such as for schools which might finish at 14:45. Decisions about schools are caught up in wider debates about regional lockdowns But Sir Kevan's plan called for a major injection of cash to extend the school day by 30 minutes, in a flexible and fully-funded way, which might be for extra lessons or for sports or arts clubs or other ""enrichment"" activities. This was the big ticket part of the plan and would have run for three years, with the aim of recovering lost learning and stopping the disruption of the pandemic becoming a long-term disadvantage. It would give schools funding for extra staffing and services, without putting extra pressure on their teachers. It had echoes of the ""extended schools"" scheme, rolled out under Tony Blair's Labour government. With Sir Kevan's resignation, the government will now have to decide what to do with the blueprint left on their desks as the door slammed. Apart from the core questions of helping children to catch up, there will be other factors to consider. Like money. And it will become part of the arm-wrestling over the next spending review. The prime minister promised more funding would be ""coming down the track"", but without any specific commitment. As well as this possible Â£15bn bid for catch-up cash, the Treasury will also be thinking about another big education project - the funding of student finance for people on vocational courses. There are still many big questions about how this expanded loan system is going to operate and how much it will cost. There's also the issue of timing and changing moods. The school catch-up tsar was appointed in February, when many pupils were studying at home, and there was huge pressure to show a pathway to a recovery. In the autumn, when funding plans are next considered, the biggest recent education issue is likely to have been another round of arguments over replacement exam results. Will the political heat have left the catch-up debate? Will there be more appetite to get back to normal rather than push for more upheaval and new initiatives? Parents might also have reservations about longer school days. Robert Halfon, chair of the education select committee, argues that education recovery has to remain a top priority - and the government needs to ""find the money from the back of the sofa"". This has to be more than a patch-up effort, he argues. ""We need some radical thinking, some thinking out of the box, a proper long-term plan,"" he said. A Downing Street spokesman said: ""The prime minister is hugely grateful to Sir Kevan for his work in helping pupils catch up and recover from the effects of the pandemic. ""The government will continue to focus on education recovery and making sure no child is left behind with their learning, with over Â£3bn committed for catch-up so far.""

leader Keir Starmer said the prime minister was âthe only G7 leader cutting his
aid budgetâ. In 2015, G7 countries
committed to spending 0.7% of their gross national income on international aid. The UK
achieved this but is planning to cut spending to 0.5% this year. Germany was above 0.7% in 2020. France was at 0.53% but has said
it will be increasing to 0.7% by 2025. Other
G7 members areat a lower level,external, including the United States (on 0.17%) The
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) says it cannot
confirm whether the UK is the only G7 country cutting foreign aid because it
doesnât have 2021 data for all seven countries. However, it was not
aware of any other country having announced cuts to its aid budgets. You can read more here.

Brexit minister Lord Frost Lord Frost has said that âthere werenât any breakthroughs, there werenât any breakdowns eitherâ in the talks with the EU Commission this morning.  He said the two sides would âcarry on talkingâ. In a short interview at the end of today's meeting, the UK's Brexit Minister said there had been âsome frank and honest discussionsâ about the situation in Northern Ireland, including on the movement of chilled meats from GB to NI. Responding to the suggestion that the UK knew that this was part of the Protocol it signed and needs to obey the rules it agreed, Frost said that âthe EU is insisting we operate the Protocol in an extremely purist way. ""The reality is that itâs a very balanced document designedâ¦ to deal with very sensitive politics in Northern Irelandâ he said. Jessica ParkerBBC political correspondent The issue of Brexit - and the Northern
Ireland protocol - emerged at Prime Ministerâs Questions. On one side a call
from the SDLP for the UK to come to terms with the EU in order to ensure fewer
checks. On the other, a Tory backbencher saying itâs the EU that needs to be
more pragmatic. Itâs a strong flavour of the arguments in play at todayâs talks
â between Lord Frost and his EU counterpart Maros Sefcovic - that
have been going on as we speak not far away from Parliament. Welsh Independent MP Jonathan Edwards asks the PM about the fate of the steel industry - will it be next to be betrayed by Brexit, he asks. The PM says Brexit offers export opportunities for Welsh farmers. Labour's Ian Lavery calls the government's catch up help for school children in England ""derisory"". He says the PM, who went to Eton and Oxford University, has a ""wonderfully privileged education background"" and asks him to explain the situation. Boris Johnson replies that this is wrong and that the scheme in place will make a ""huge difference"" to pupils. The issue of forced adoptions is raised by the Conservative Sir David Amess who says thousands of women suffered as a result, including those in his Southend constituency. Does the PM agree that an apology should be given and an acknowledgement that this was wrong, he asks. Johnson says he echoes the sentiments about those who have been affected. But he says the practices can't happen now because the law has been changed to protect people. The agencies involved have apologised he adds and that's  ""quite right too"". TheBBC has reported the stories of hundreds of womenforced to  give up their babies for adoption in the 1950s, 60s and 70s. Former prime minister Theresa May says in April 1989, 96 Liverpool fans ""were unlawfully killed at Hillsborough"" but nobody has ever been prosecuted for these deaths. She says the most recent trial collapsed because police evidence had been changed. She asks for the PM to look at the ramifications of this for future inquiries, and for the families of the Hillsborough 96. Boris Johnson says the families of those killed in the Hillsborough disaster ""have shown tremendous courage and determination"". He says ""we will always consider opportunities to consider the law and how it operates"" and will be considering this case. Labour's Andrew Gwynne asks about the resignation of advisers and recent criticisms over standards in government, saying: ""Does the prime minister wonder why this keeps happening to him?"" The PM responds that the government takes standards seriously. Conservative David Jones is up next and he also asks about the ongoing Brexit tensions with the EU. He says he notes that some in Brussels have problems with Lord Frost, who negotiated Britain's departure. Jones asks if the PM agrees with Frost's assessment that matters would be easier if the EU adopted a pragmatic rather than a purist approach to implementing the rules. Johnson says he agrees with Frost ""completely"" and thinks he is doing an ""outstanding job"". Labour MP Fabian Hamilton asks what is being done to avoid marriage and inheritance exploitation. He says an elderly constituent of his with late stage dementia was married by a man who befriended her. This, he says, wiped out her previous will, and meant her entire estate was left to him. Since this episode, he says he has been contacted by ""hundreds"" of other people whose family members have had the same thing happen to them. Boris Johnson says he will put Mr Hamilton in contact with the relevant people in government to deal with the issue. Labour's Barry Sheerman asks when the government's ""levelling-up"" agenda is ""going to start"", criticising the level of resources and quality of management of projects. The PM responds that people ""across the country"" are responding to a ""massive"" investment, transforming ""lives, hopes and opportunities"". Colum Eastwood from the SDLP raises the issue of how Brexit is playing out in Northern Ireland with the so-called Northern Ireland protocol. He asks why the PM is prioritising getting ""cheap, dodgy beef from Australia"" over the concerns of the people of Northern Ireland and reducing checks in the Irish sea. The PM says that is wrong. He says he is prioritising the rights and ability of the people of Northern Ireland to have access to goods from GB and is also protecting  the integrity of the UK. Tory MP Scott Benton calls the catch-up help for children in England a ""tutoring revolution"". The PM agrees, describing it as an ""evidence-based"" intervention, offering three to five months' worth of help. SNP Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, is up. He wishes all the best to Scotland's team for the forthcoming European football championship. He says the PM will walk in to the G7 summit as the only country to cut aid spending at a time when people need it most and is ""on the run from his own moral and legal responsibilities"". Will Johnson commit to a vote on ""his inhumane cuts"" he asks? The PM says people of this country are in favour of the balance the country is striking because we are in very difficult financial times and are already spending Â£10bn. But ""no-one is safe until all are safe"" says Blackford so we should support each other ""rather than walk away from those in need"". Johnson repeats his earlier comment that one in three of the vaccines being distributed around the world come from the Oxford AstraZeneca supply. For his final question, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer says the government is the only member of the G7 which is cutting its aid budget. He says business development groups are calling for leadership from the UK on overseas aid. He says the prospect of a new government in Israel is an opportunity to reset talks in the Middle East for Israelis and Palestinians. He says over 60 Palestinian children died in the latest conflict. ""For too many in Palestine"" the ""recognition of a sovereign state"" is too distant, he states. Boris Johnson says it's ""been a long standing"" view of the UK that the way to achieve peace in the Middle East is for a two state solution. ""Under this government, we continue to spend more than Labour ever did"" on overseas aid, he adds. In his fifth, and penultimate, question to the PM, Sir Keir Starmer says the attainment gap will rise under the government's plans, accusing Boris Johnson of being ""all over the place"". Turnng to this week's G7 summit, Sir Keir says the UK must lead a ""truly global effort"" to increase Covid vaccinations. Johnson replies that this is ""indeed"" happening already, and that one in three doses distributed around the world are of Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Billie Eilish, David Beckham and Priyanka Chopra Jonas signed the letter Millions of Covid vaccines could be wasted if rich countries send large amounts of leftover doses to poorer nations in one go, Unicef has warned. The charity said there needed to be a steady supply throughout the year because poor countries do not have resources to use them all at once. The UK and others have promised to donate their surplus doses - but they have been asked to give more earlier. Stars including Billie Eilish and David Beckham are backing Unicef's plea. The celebrities have signed a letter to the G7 group of rich countries - including the UK - asking them to donate 20% of their vaccines by August. ""The pandemic will not be over anywhere until it is over everywhere,"" said Beckham. The other stars who have signed the letter include Andy Murray, Olivia Colman, Ewan McGregor, Liam Payne, Priyanka Chopra Jonas, Orlando Bloom, Katy Perry, Gemma Chan, Whoopi Goldberg, Claudia Schiffer and Chris Hoy. Unicef's vaccine lead Lily Caprani told BBC Newsnight that countries needed to vaccinate their own populations at the same time as the rest of the world. ""At some point, no doubt, we will need to vaccinate under-18s,"" she said. ""But the priority at this moment has to be making sure that all of the vulnerable and priority groups around the world get vaccines. ""So we're saying countries like the UK and the G7 need to donate their doses to those low income countries now, while still vaccinating their populations at home."" But last week, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said vaccinating children in the UK would take priority over sending doses abroad. Unlike other countries, the UK has not revealed how many doses it plans to donate to the Covax vaccine-sharing scheme, saying only that it will donate its excess doses. On Friday Mr Hancock said the UK did not currently have any spare doses. People queue to receive vaccines in Delhi, India, which has been hit hard by the virus Earlier this week more than 100 former prime ministers, presidents and foreign ministers urged leaders of the G7 countries to pay two-thirds of the Â£46.6bn needed to vaccinate low-income countries against Covid. Ex-PM Tony Blair said the ""reality"" was that governments are ""obliged to look after [their] own people"" and so will always prioritise vaccinating their own country first. But he said, ""you can't be absolutist about this, there may be some vaccine that we can ship out in advance"". Another former UK PM, Gordon Brown, said the G7 and other wealthy nations ""should pay their share"" to help parts of Africa and Asia. He said it should not be left to a ""whip round"" to deal with a ""disease that has got to be brought under control."" Vaccines: How fast is worldwide progress? Covid vaccine tracker: How's my country doing? Where are cases the highest? Unicef's Ms Caprani called on G7 countries to start donating jabs now as well as throughout the summer and the rest of the year. ""Low income countries need a steady supply that they can get off the tarmac and into the arms of health care workers,"" she said. ""The unintended consequence of saving all these vaccines up to Christmas time is that countries won't be able to absorb them and roll them out and therefore they could end up going to waste. We could see millions of doses of vaccines not used and expiring, and that will be a tragedy."" In their letter, the celebrities said Unicef was already delivering vaccines in poor countries - but the charity was 190 million doses short. The letter said the G7 countries  - the UK, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the US - will soon have enough to donate 20% of their doses between June and August without significant delay to their own rollouts, and doing that would provide more than 150 million doses to Covax. ""The virus is still spreading in many countries and producing new variants with the potential to put us all back where we started,"" said the letter to the G7 group. Some of the celebrities such as tennis star Murray are also urging people in the UK to donate to Unicef's VaccinAid appeal. This video can not be played Covax vaccine plan: What is it and how will it work? Some countries, like the UK which has ordered 400 million doses of various vaccines, have already vaccinated a large proportion of their citizens. But other countries are still waiting for their first shipments to arrive. Many poorer countries are relying on deliveries from Covax. At the G7 summit later this week, Prime Minister Boris Johnsonis planning to urge setting a targetto vaccinate the world by the end of 2022. Campaigners and critics - as well as a group of MPs - say action needs to be taken now and Britain should donate a dose for every jab imported into the UK. The UK governmenthas already donated Â£548min aid money to the Covax scheme, andhalf a billion doses of the Oxford/AstraZeneca jab have been ordered,externalby other countries and sent abroad. The leaders of the seven G7 countries are meeting in Cornwall for their annual summit this weekend. The US, France, Germany, Italy and Japan have all said how many doses they will donate to Covax.

"This video can not be played Protecting trade flows east-west and north-south across the island of Ireland is ""easily doable"", says Boris Johnson The EU says its patience is ""wearing very thin"" with the UK in talks aimed at avoiding a post-Brexit trade war. Top EU official Maros Sefcovic said the UK must start checking goods entering Northern Ireland, as agreed in the 2019 Brexit ""divorce"" settlement. The UK says it is ready to ignore the rules to prevent further disruption - sparking threats of EU retaliation. Boris Johnson said a solution that protects trade flows and the peace process was ""easily doable"". And he dismissed talk of a trade war with the EU, saying he was ""not worried"" it would overshadow the G7 summit. The prime minister is in Cornwall, where he will host the leaders of the world's richest nations, including US President Joe Biden, who is said to have ""deep"" concerns that a UK-EU trade row could endanger peace in Northern Ireland. Why is there a UK-EU row over sausages? Don't imperil NI peace, Biden to warn UK and EU EU to begin legal action over NI Protocol 'breach' Asked about this, Mr Johnson said everyone needed to be ""absolutely clear"" that the purpose of the Northern Ireland protocol - the part of the Brexit deal at the centre of the row - was to ""uphold the Belfast Good Friday Agreement, to make sure that we keep the balance in relationships in Northern Ireland"". He said he was ""optimistic"" a solution could be found that ""protects the peace process, but also guarantees the economic and territorial integrity of the whole United Kingdom"". Lord Frost (L) has been discussing border issues with his EU counterpart Maros Sefcovic in central London Talks between Mr Sefcovic - a vice-president of the European Commission - and UK Brexit minister Lord Frost broke up earlier without agreement. Mr Sefcovic said he was ""positive we can find a solution"" but added: ""Our patience really is wearing very, very thin, and therefore we have to assess all options we have at our disposal."" This could include legal action, arbitration or retaliatory trade measures such as tariffs, he explained. He said ""trust"" had to be restored between the two sides, after the UK had broken the terms of the 2019 Northern Ireland protocol. A key flashpoint is a looming ban on the export of sausages and other chilled meats from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) no longer follows EU rules but Northern Ireland does - because it shares a land border with the Republic of Ireland, an EU member. EU food safety rules do not allow chilled meat products to enter its market from non-members like the UK. Frozen meat is not covered by the rules. In January, the two sides agreed a six month ""grace"" period to allow companies to set up alternative supply chains, but that runs out at the end of June. The UK has already held back from carrying out full checks on supermarket goods and parcels moving from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, prompting the EU to accuse the UK of undermining the protocol and tobegin legal proceedings. Mr Sefcovic said: ""If the UK were to take further unilateral action in the coming weeks the EU will not be shy in acting swiftly, firmly and resolutely to ensure the UK abides by its international obligations."" A UK source close to the negotiations said: ""Nobody wants to get into a trade war or anything close to it."" It was ""much better to find agreed ways forward"", added the source, and ""the people in Northern Ireland want solutions not threats"". ""But unfortunately we have got used to living in an atmosphere where there are threats."" Asked by ITV's Robert Peston if the UK would take unilateral action, Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis said ""we're not at that stage yet but we've said we will keep all options open."" There's a clash of cultures at the heart of this increasingly serious dispute. The EU is a union of laws and rules - and once it has an agreement it tends to stick to the details. The British government, on the other hand, decided to kick some of the details down the road in its desire to ""Get Brexit Done"". But those details never went away, and now they are threatening to provoke another crisis in Britain's relationship with Europe, and to destabilise Northern Ireland. During the 2019 general election campaign Boris Johnson said there would be no checks on goods moving in either direction between Great Britain and Northern Ireland as a result of his Brexit deal, even though official documents at the time made clear that there would be. Now his government says the EU needs to show more flexibility, that it's being too legalistic. The practicalities of implementing the Northern Ireland Protocol in full are certainly pretty challenging. Northern Ireland's chief vet recently told Assembly members in Belfast that it would require more checks on food than are done in the whole of the EU. And he only has 12 vets. The EU says it is prepared to be flexible, but says the UK cannot walk away from its legal obligations. Both sides talk about ""considering all our options"" if a compromise can't be found. In public at least, it's hard to see where the common ground lies. Mr Sefcovic said the EU had offered a temporary solution to the chilled meats row, ahead of a comprehensive trade deal, but he said the UK was not prepared to accept it because it would involve signing up to EU food standards. ""Ideology prevails over what is good for the people of Northern Ireland,"" he added. Northern Irish ports such as Larne have seen additional border checks under the protocol Speaking after his meeting with Mr Sefcovic, Lord Frost said the protocol was ""being implemented in a way which is causing disruption in Northern Ireland and we had some pretty frank and honest discussions about that situation"". ""There weren't any breakthroughs, there weren't any breakdowns either and we are going to carry on talking,"" he added. ""What we really now need to do is very urgently find some solutions, which support the Belfast Good Friday Agreement, Support the peace process in Northern Ireland and allow things to return to normal."" Government 'knew NI Protocol was bad deal' Can sea border âteething problemsâ be solved? Lord Frost said the EU was insisting that the two sides ""operate the protocol in an extremely purist way"" and he did not see any problem with continuing to allow exports of chilled meats. ""We don't see what risk is caused to Northern Ireland if chilled meats are imported there from GB."" Northern Ireland's deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill - who also took part in the meeting - challenged the UK government to ""honour its commitments"" on the Brexit protocol. ""Certainly there's a frustration that the British government have signed up to this agreement, however they have failed to bring forward ways to implement the Protocol in its entirety,"" she added.

Brexit minister Lord Frost Lord Frost has said that âthere werenât any breakthroughs, there werenât any breakdowns eitherâ in the talks with the EU Commission this morning.  He said the two sides would âcarry on talkingâ. In a short interview at the end of today's meeting, the UK's Brexit Minister said there had been âsome frank and honest discussionsâ about the situation in Northern Ireland, including on the movement of chilled meats from GB to NI.

""The reality is that itâs a very balanced document designedâ¦ to deal with very sensitive politics in Northern Irelandâ he said. Jessica ParkerBBC political correspondent The issue of Brexit - and the Northern
Ireland protocol - emerged at Prime Ministerâs Questions. On one side a call
from the SDLP for the UK to come to terms with the EU in order to ensure fewer
checks. On the other, a Tory backbencher saying itâs the EU that needs to be
more pragmatic. Itâs a strong flavour of the arguments in play at todayâs talks
â between Lord Frost and his EU counterpart Maros Sefcovic - that
have been going on as we speak not far away from Parliament. Welsh Independent MP Jonathan Edwards asks the PM about the fate of the steel industry - will it be next to be betrayed by Brexit, he asks. The PM says Brexit offers export opportunities for Welsh farmers. Labour's Ian Lavery calls the government's catch up help for school children in England ""derisory"". He says the PM, who went to Eton and Oxford University, has a ""wonderfully privileged education background"" and asks him to explain the situation. Boris Johnson replies that this is wrong and that the scheme in place will make a ""huge difference"" to pupils. The issue of forced adoptions is raised by the Conservative Sir David Amess who says thousands of women suffered as a result, including those in his Southend constituency. Does the PM agree that an apology should be given and an acknowledgement that this was wrong, he asks. Johnson says he echoes the sentiments about those who have been affected. But he says the practices can't happen now because the law has been changed to protect people. The agencies involved have apologised he adds and that's  ""quite right too"". TheBBC has reported the stories of hundreds of womenforced to  give up their babies for adoption in the 1950s, 60s and 70s. Former prime minister Theresa May says in April 1989, 96 Liverpool fans ""were unlawfully killed at Hillsborough"" but nobody has ever been prosecuted for these deaths. She says the most recent trial collapsed because police evidence had been changed. She asks for the PM to look at the ramifications of this for future inquiries, and for the families of the Hillsborough 96. Boris Johnson says the families of those killed in the Hillsborough disaster ""have shown tremendous courage and determination"". He says ""we will always consider opportunities to consider the law and how it operates"" and will be considering this case. Labour's Andrew Gwynne asks about the resignation of advisers and recent criticisms over standards in government, saying: ""Does the prime minister wonder why this keeps happening to him?"" The PM responds that the government takes standards seriously. Conservative David Jones is up next and he also asks about the ongoing Brexit tensions with the EU. He says he notes that some in Brussels have problems with Lord Frost, who negotiated Britain's departure. Jones asks if the PM agrees with Frost's assessment that matters would be easier if the EU adopted a pragmatic rather than a purist approach to implementing the rules. Johnson says he agrees with Frost ""completely"" and thinks he is doing an ""outstanding job"". Labour MP Fabian Hamilton asks what is being done to avoid marriage and inheritance exploitation. He says an elderly constituent of his with late stage dementia was married by a man who befriended her. This, he says, wiped out her previous will, and meant her entire estate was left to him. Since this episode, he says he has been contacted by ""hundreds"" of other people whose family members have had the same thing happen to them. Boris Johnson says he will put Mr Hamilton in contact with the relevant people in government to deal with the issue. Labour's Barry Sheerman asks when the government's ""levelling-up"" agenda is ""going to start"", criticising the level of resources and quality of management of projects. The PM responds that people ""across the country"" are responding to a ""massive"" investment, transforming ""lives, hopes and opportunities"". Colum Eastwood from the SDLP raises the issue of how Brexit is playing out in Northern Ireland with the so-called Northern Ireland protocol. He asks why the PM is prioritising getting ""cheap, dodgy beef from Australia"" over the concerns of the people of Northern Ireland and reducing checks in the Irish sea. The PM says that is wrong. He says he is prioritising the rights and ability of the people of Northern Ireland to have access to goods from GB and is also protecting  the integrity of the UK. Tory MP Scott Benton calls the catch-up help for children in England a ""tutoring revolution"". The PM agrees, describing it as an ""evidence-based"" intervention, offering three to five months' worth of help. SNP Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, is up. He wishes all the best to Scotland's team for the forthcoming European football championship. He says the PM will walk in to the G7 summit as the only country to cut aid spending at a time when people need it most and is ""on the run from his own moral and legal responsibilities"". Will Johnson commit to a vote on ""his inhumane cuts"" he asks? The PM says people of this country are in favour of the balance the country is striking because we are in very difficult financial times and are already spending Â£10bn. But ""no-one is safe until all are safe"" says Blackford so we should support each other ""rather than walk away from those in need"". Johnson repeats his earlier comment that one in three of the vaccines being distributed around the world come from the Oxford AstraZeneca supply. For his final question, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer says the government is the only member of the G7 which is cutting its aid budget. He says business development groups are calling for leadership from the UK on overseas aid. He says the prospect of a new government in Israel is an opportunity to reset talks in the Middle East for Israelis and Palestinians. He says over 60 Palestinian children died in the latest conflict. ""For too many in Palestine"" the ""recognition of a sovereign state"" is too distant, he states. Boris Johnson says it's ""been a long standing"" view of the UK that the way to achieve peace in the Middle East is for a two state solution. ""Under this government, we continue to spend more than Labour ever did"" on overseas aid, he adds. In his fifth, and penultimate, question to the PM, Sir Keir Starmer says the attainment gap will rise under the government's plans, accusing Boris Johnson of being ""all over the place"". Turnng to this week's G7 summit, Sir Keir says the UK must lead a ""truly global effort"" to increase Covid vaccinations. Johnson replies that this is ""indeed"" happening already, and that one in three doses distributed around the world are of Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine. Â© 2025 BBC.

"The Halo Trust workers were shot ""in cold blood"" Masked gunmen have shot dead 10 mine clearers working for the Halo Trust in Afghanistan's northern province of Baghlan, and wounded more than a dozen. The workers were killed when gunmen burst into their compound at 21:50 (17:20 GMT) on Tuesday, after they had spent a day removing mines from a nearby field. The Islamic State group (IS) said it had carried out the attack. Afghan officials had blamed the Taliban, who denied involvement. Halo Trust CEO James Cowan told the BBC that the local Taliban had, on the contrary, helped in the aftermath. IS made the claim in a statement via its channels on the messaging app Telegram. Violence has surged in Afghanistan since the US began to withdraw its last troops on 1 May. The departure of international troops comes amid a deadlock in peace talks between the Afghan government and the Taliban. Rapid relocation planned for Afghan interpreters How can the West fight terror after leaving Afghanistan? Have things got better in Afghanistan? Mr Cowan of the Halo Trust told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the attackers had gone ""bed to bed"" shooting the workers ""in cold blood"" - but that the local Taliban had helped the deminers. ""I think it's important to know that the Taliban have denied responsibility for this, and indeed the local Taliban group came to our aid and scared the assailants off,"" he said. ""I think we have the capacity as the Halo Trust to operate on both sides of the line in this awful conflict,"" he added. Mr Cowan later told the BBC Afghan service that the attackers had specifically targeted members of the Hazara ethnic minority group. Hazaras, Afghanistan's third-largest ethnic group, have faced long-term discrimination and persecution, primarily because of their Shia Muslim faith. In recent years, they have faced abductions and killings at the hands of IS and the Taliban, which are both Sunni Muslim. 'IS wants to wipe us out' - Afghan Shias in the firing line ""A group of armed men came to our camp and sought out members of the Hazara community, and then murdered them,"" Mr Cowan said. ""This was not expected. The broader security situation [in Afghanistan] is understood, but this kind of cold-blooded killing was not expected."" After an interior ministry spokesman told reporters that the Taliban had carried out the attack, the militant group's spokesman, Zabihullah Mujahid, tweeted that it condemned attacks on the defenceless. ""We have normal relations with NGOs [non-governmental organisations]. Our Mujahideen will never carry out such brutal attacks,"" he said. Several districts in Baghlan province have seen fierce fighting between the Taliban and government forces. Analysis by Inayatulhaq Yasini, BBC Kabul bureau editor Halo Trust and other demining organisations have been working in Afghanistan for more than three decades, freely moving even near frontlines, a fact I have seen for myself. Halo Trust has 3,000 staff in Afghanistan. Warring factions have been helpful to deminers in the past - however it has been rare for the Taliban or other groups to come forward to help victims of an attack. Halo Trust mostly hires local people, which also creates jobs for local communities. The organisation's CEO, James Cowan, told the BBC the attackers had ""fled to an area which is not controlled by the Taliban"". The province of Baghlan where the attack happened has been the scene of fighting between the government and the Taliban for weeks. Anyone can exploit a situation where different local militias and warlords are also active in the province. The aim of the attack is clear: to incite ethnic tension among Afghans, where 40 years of war has already widely affected unity in the country. In a clip police in Baghlan shared with reporters, a survivor of the attack also said the gunmen had asked if any of them were from the Hazara minority community before opening fire. ""Five to six armed men came, they took us to a room,"" he said. ""First they took all our money and mobile phones, and then they asked who our leader was. They asked, 'Is any Hazara here among you?' We told them, 'We don't have any Hazara here.'"" He added that he had been shot in the head, but managed to escape through a window. The UK-based Halo Trust was founded in 1988 to remove ordnance left behind from the almost decade-long Soviet occupation of Afghanistan. It was supported by Princess Diana, as well as by her son Prince Harry.

committed to spending 0.7% of their gross national income on international aid. The UK
achieved this but is planning to cut spending to 0.5% this year. Germany was above 0.7% in 2020. France was at 0.53% but has said
it will be increasing to 0.7% by 2025. Other
G7 members areat a lower level,external, including the United States (on 0.17%) The
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) says it cannot
confirm whether the UK is the only G7 country cutting foreign aid because it
doesnât have 2021 data for all seven countries. However, it was not
aware of any other country having announced cuts to its aid budgets. You can read more here. Jessica ParkerBBC political correspondent Sir Keir Starmer and Boris Johnson clashed over catch up funding for students following the resignation of education tsar Sir Kevan Collins. Sir Kevansaid the governmentâs plan fell âfar shortâ
of what was needed. Sir Keir agreed itâs not enough, while the prime minister passionately defends the plan. Regardless of any short term tussles,
there is likely to be a long term, broader tension; between calls to invest in
various sectors - to make up for lost time - versus a desire in some quarters
to get greater control over public spending. So what did we learn from today's session? Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Brexit minister Lord Frost Lord Frost has said that âthere werenât any breakthroughs, there werenât any breakdowns eitherâ in the talks with the EU Commission this morning.  He said the two sides would âcarry on talkingâ. In a short interview at the end of today's meeting, the UK's Brexit Minister said there had been âsome frank and honest discussionsâ about the situation in Northern Ireland, including on the movement of chilled meats from GB to NI. Responding to the suggestion that the UK knew that this was part of the Protocol it signed and needs to obey the rules it agreed, Frost said that âthe EU is insisting we operate the Protocol in an extremely purist way. ""The reality is that itâs a very balanced document designedâ¦ to deal with very sensitive politics in Northern Irelandâ he said. Jessica ParkerBBC political correspondent The issue of Brexit - and the Northern
Ireland protocol - emerged at Prime Ministerâs Questions. On one side a call
from the SDLP for the UK to come to terms with the EU in order to ensure fewer
checks. On the other, a Tory backbencher saying itâs the EU that needs to be
more pragmatic. Itâs a strong flavour of the arguments in play at todayâs talks
â between Lord Frost and his EU counterpart Maros Sefcovic - that
have been going on as we speak not far away from Parliament. Welsh Independent MP Jonathan Edwards asks the PM about the fate of the steel industry - will it be next to be betrayed by Brexit, he asks. The PM says Brexit offers export opportunities for Welsh farmers. Labour's Ian Lavery calls the government's catch up help for school children in England ""derisory"". He says the PM, who went to Eton and Oxford University, has a ""wonderfully privileged education background"" and asks him to explain the situation. Boris Johnson replies that this is wrong and that the scheme in place will make a ""huge difference"" to pupils. The issue of forced adoptions is raised by the Conservative Sir David Amess who says thousands of women suffered as a result, including those in his Southend constituency. Does the PM agree that an apology should be given and an acknowledgement that this was wrong, he asks. Johnson says he echoes the sentiments about those who have been affected. But he says the practices can't happen now because the law has been changed to protect people. The agencies involved have apologised he adds and that's  ""quite right too"". TheBBC has reported the stories of hundreds of womenforced to  give up their babies for adoption in the 1950s, 60s and 70s. Former prime minister Theresa May says in April 1989, 96 Liverpool fans ""were unlawfully killed at Hillsborough"" but nobody has ever been prosecuted for these deaths. She says the most recent trial collapsed because police evidence had been changed. She asks for the PM to look at the ramifications of this for future inquiries, and for the families of the Hillsborough 96. Boris Johnson says the families of those killed in the Hillsborough disaster ""have shown tremendous courage and determination"". He says ""we will always consider opportunities to consider the law and how it operates"" and will be considering this case. Labour's Andrew Gwynne asks about the resignation of advisers and recent criticisms over standards in government, saying: ""Does the prime minister wonder why this keeps happening to him?"" The PM responds that the government takes standards seriously. Conservative David Jones is up next and he also asks about the ongoing Brexit tensions with the EU. He says he notes that some in Brussels have problems with Lord Frost, who negotiated Britain's departure. Jones asks if the PM agrees with Frost's assessment that matters would be easier if the EU adopted a pragmatic rather than a purist approach to implementing the rules. Johnson says he agrees with Frost ""completely"" and thinks he is doing an ""outstanding job"". Labour MP Fabian Hamilton asks what is being done to avoid marriage and inheritance exploitation. He says an elderly constituent of his with late stage dementia was married by a man who befriended her. This, he says, wiped out her previous will, and meant her entire estate was left to him. Since this episode, he says he has been contacted by ""hundreds"" of other people whose family members have had the same thing happen to them. Boris Johnson says he will put Mr Hamilton in contact with the relevant people in government to deal with the issue. Labour's Barry Sheerman asks when the government's ""levelling-up"" agenda is ""going to start"", criticising the level of resources and quality of management of projects. The PM responds that people ""across the country"" are responding to a ""massive"" investment, transforming ""lives, hopes and opportunities"". Colum Eastwood from the SDLP raises the issue of how Brexit is playing out in Northern Ireland with the so-called Northern Ireland protocol. He asks why the PM is prioritising getting ""cheap, dodgy beef from Australia"" over the concerns of the people of Northern Ireland and reducing checks in the Irish sea. The PM says that is wrong. He says he is prioritising the rights and ability of the people of Northern Ireland to have access to goods from GB and is also protecting  the integrity of the UK. Tory MP Scott Benton calls the catch-up help for children in England a ""tutoring revolution"". The PM agrees, describing it as an ""evidence-based"" intervention, offering three to five months' worth of help. SNP Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, is up. He wishes all the best to Scotland's team for the forthcoming European football championship. He says the PM will walk in to the G7 summit as the only country to cut aid spending at a time when people need it most and is ""on the run from his own moral and legal responsibilities"". Will Johnson commit to a vote on ""his inhumane cuts"" he asks? The PM says people of this country are in favour of the balance the country is striking because we are in very difficult financial times and are already spending Â£10bn. But ""no-one is safe until all are safe"" says Blackford so we should support each other ""rather than walk away from those in need"". Johnson repeats his earlier comment that one in three of the vaccines being distributed around the world come from the Oxford AstraZeneca supply. For his final question, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer says the government is the only member of the G7 which is cutting its aid budget. He says business development groups are calling for leadership from the UK on overseas aid. He says the prospect of a new government in Israel is an opportunity to reset talks in the Middle East for Israelis and Palestinians. He says over 60 Palestinian children died in the latest conflict. ""For too many in Palestine"" the ""recognition of a sovereign state"" is too distant, he states. Boris Johnson says it's ""been a long standing"" view of the UK that the way to achieve peace in the Middle East is for a two state solution. ""Under this government, we continue to spend more than Labour ever did"" on overseas aid, he adds. In his fifth, and penultimate, question to the PM, Sir Keir Starmer says the attainment gap will rise under the government's plans, accusing Boris Johnson of being ""all over the place"". Turnng to this week's G7 summit, Sir Keir says the UK must lead a ""truly global effort"" to increase Covid vaccinations. Johnson replies that this is ""indeed"" happening already, and that one in three doses distributed around the world are of Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine. Â© 2025 BBC.

"French cafes reopened last month for customers sitting outside - now they can sit inside too France and Belgium have both entered their next phase for reopening in time for summer. In France, bars, restaurants, gyms and swimming pools are welcoming people indoors for the first time in seven months. Belgium is also easing its rules to allow indoor dining at cafes and restaurants. Both countries retain some limits, however, with numbers of customers restricted in both cases. In France, restaurants and bars can now operate at 50% capacity indoors. Gyms and indoor swimming pools are also only able to admit half of their maximum capacity. Outdoor terraces, which were allowed to open with restrictions last month, will now be able to operate at full capacity. Renowned bistro chef Yves Camdeborde told French radio ""we feel happy and a little relieved after the months we've just gone through which have been psychologically hard and financially catastrophic"". ""It's almost strange to hear a client say 'a coffee inside please',"" Christophe Guedes, who owns a bar in the suburbs of Paris, told the AFP news agency. How is Europe lifting lockdown restrictions? What is happening with the EU vaccine rollout? An overnight curfew will also be delayed by two hours, meaning that people will be able to remain outside until 23:00 local time. The curfew could be scrapped altogether on 30 June if infection rates remain low. Other changes include an end to rules on working from home, although employers will have to agree the number of days staff come into the office in advance. Visitors from the EU and a number of other countries - including Australia, Israel, Lebanon and South Korea - can now visit France from without a PCR test, as long as they have completed the full course of an EU-approved vaccine (Pfizer/BioNTech, Oxford/AstraZeneca, Moderna or Johnson & Johnson). Fully vaccinated people from other areas, including the UK and the US, will still have to provide a negative test, but will no longer have to provide a compelling reason for travel. UK visitors have to quarantine on their return home. The rules will remain in place until the EU's green pass comes into effect in early July. While promoting the easing of restrictions on Tuesday,President Emmanuel Macron was slapped during a visit to a hotel school in the south east of France. President Macron later called it an ""isolated event"", while politicians from across the political divide condemned the incident. This video can not be played President Macron was slapped in the face by a member of the public Two 28-year-old men were detained after the incident in the town of Tain-l'Hermitage. French media said firearms and a copy of Hitler's Mein Kampf were found during a search of one of the pair, Arthur C, who is suspected of filming the slap. A similar roll-back of restrictions is taking place in Belgium from Wednesday, with cafes and restaurants allowing up to four customers per table indoors. Indoor events of no more than 200 people, or 75% capacity, are also being permitted. Working from home rules remain in place, although workers can now request to spend one day per week in the office as long as larger offices keep to a daily capacity of 20% of the workforce. Belgians can now visit each other at home, with up to four visitors permitted. The European Parliament voted on Wednesday to enshrine into law an EU-wide travel document known as the digital Covid certificate. Allow Twitter content?

were brought to you by Victoria Lindrea, Jennifer Meierhans, Joshua Nevett, Ella

Here's a round-up of the main headlines today: This video can not be played Free Hugs: Does Covid mean the end of hugging strangers? The Covid pandemic put a stop to the Free Hugs movement - with social distancing guidelines and restrictions in place in countries around the world. The group used to offer hugs to strangers every weekend - but they say any decision to relax social distancing should be treated with caution. BBC health reporter, Laura Foster, spoke to some members of Free Hugs UK about the importance of hugs and when they might be able to freely hug again. The Penta Hotel in Reading's Oxford Rd opened as a quarantine facility on 29 April A local council has called on the government to shut a quarantine hotel in Reading after a total of 44 positive cases of Covid-19 were identified among residents and staff. Reading Council says it is ""unconvinced"" the outbreak is under control or that robust safety measures are in place. The quarantine facility, run by the Department of Health and Social Care, opened on 29 April. Reading Borough Council says it was notified of the first Covid outbreak on 9 May. The local authority says cases have spread ""between guests, and hotel and security staff"". It says it believes at least three cases in the community have been directly linked to the hotel's outbreak and the spread ""could have been avoided had the correct safety procedures been in place"" at the outset. The majority of the positive cases have been identified as the Delta variant. The Department for Health and Social Care has been approached for comment. Prime Minister Boris Johnson says itâs
too early to say if England's lockdown can end on 21 June as data on whether
the vaccine rollout offers enough protection from the Delta variant is still being assessed. ""On Monday... we'll have a look
at where we are. I think what everybody can see very clearly is that cases are
going up, and in some places hospitalisations are going up,"" he says, speaking in Cornwall ahead of the G7 conference. ""What we need to assess is the
extent to which the vaccine rollout - which has been phenomenal - has built up
protection in the population in order for us to go ahead to the next stage. And
so that's what we'll be looking at."" As we reported earlier, the UK has recorded another 7,540 coronavirus cases over the past 24 hours - the highest number of daily cases reported since the end of February. Cases have risen dramatically over the past week, with a seven-day average of 5,984 - as the Delta variant continues to make its presence felt. But the number of cases is still far off the peak in January - and daily deaths remain low: on Wednesday, data showed a further six deaths within 28 days of a positive test - compared with 12 deaths a week ago. Scientists attribute the fall in both hospitalisations and deaths to the success of the vaccine rollout. More than half the adult population - 54.2% - are now fully vaccinated, while 77.3% have had one jab.   High school pupils in Scotland retuned to face-to-face lessons after the Easter holidays The number of Covid infections recorded among children in Scotland is now at the highest level it has been since the start of the outbreak. Weekly infections among children aged up to 14 reached 1,064 on 7 June - higher than the peak in early January, according to Public Health Scotland. While there is no evidence children are becoming seriously ill - with no significant rise in hospital admissions - growing numbers of pupils are off school. Provisional figures indicate 15,687 pupils were absent for Covid-related reasons at the end of last week, with overall attendance dropping to 87.8%. Data shows a four-fold increase in cases among children under 15, but infection rates are still considerably higher among young adults and older teenagers. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said Scotland will move quickly to vaccinate 12-15 year olds if recommended by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation. Read the full story. A number of government reviews are currently under way looking at Covid-19 measures in England. Their findings will inform wider policy forstep four of the roadmap plan,external- which will happen on 21 June at the earliest, butcould be delayed past then. What
reviews are there?  Find out morehere. Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics The number of people in
hospital with coronavirus is on the rise again and reached 1,024 on Monday 7 June,
rising above 1,000 for the first time since mid-May. Back then, numbers were
falling and they reached a low point of just under 870 on 27 May. But they have risen by nearly
20% in the 11 days since then. This is still far below the
peak in Januaryâs wave when nearly 40,000 people were in hospital with
coronavirus in the UK. And people in the NHS say the cases theyâre seeing now are less serious than in previous waves. But they underline the inevitable
impact of the rising case numbers that we have been seeing in the UK. The rises in people in
hospital are driven by increasing numbers of people in hospital in Scotland and
the North West of England, the region and nation where cases have been rising
for the longest in the UK in the early stages of this third wave. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Traffic control measures have been imposed in parts of Guangzhou in an attempt to limit the spread of the virus In the past 24
hours, China has confirmed eight new domestic symptomatic cases of Covid-19,
all in southern Guangdong province. This is the
only area of mainland China where there is currently an outbreak; 164 people
are currently in hospital across the province. Most patients are in the
populous city of Guangzhou, which along with the nearby city of Foshan and
Wuchuan County, has local lockdowns in place. Guangzhou is
one of Chinaâs biggest cities, and as cases of mutant variants have been
detected, there have been some fears that it could see a large-scale outbreak,
like those seen in the cities ofWuhanorShijiazhuang. However, huge
vaccine uptake has helped China avoid a third wave â more than 800 million
vaccine doses have now been administeredacross the country,externaland recent media reports have suggested new patients have exhibited mild or no
symptoms. Even with
triple-digit cases, tens of thousands of students have still been able to sit
their university entrance exams in Guangzhou this week. This would have been
unthinkable during earlier outbreaks â Chinaâs approach to date has been to
swiftly lock down communities and order mass testing drives, allowing people
very little room for manoeuvre. But vaccination uptake has helped China relax
its Covid-19 regulations. Local governments have been increasingly finding safe
ways for events to go ahead, rather than simply cancelling them. It is still
not clear how this latest outbreak began. Health officials in Guangzhou say the genetic sequencing of cases in the city show a 98% similarity,
suggesting they are all linked to the same chain of transmission. A local
health commission official tells the official CCTV broadcasterâmore investigation is needed to identify patient zeroâ,external. Philippa RoxbyHealth reporter, BBC News There are still many unknowns about the Delta variant, first
detected in India, which is causing a worrying rise in cases and hospital
admissions in some areas of the UK. Overall, the virus is still at low levels â but there is now
clear concern from scientists that a third wave could be on its way. Prof Neil Ferguson, virus modeller from Imperial College
London, tells journalists the size and scale of that wave depends on how
effective the vaccines are at protecting against illness from the Delta
variant. That still isnât clear and more data needs to be collected. The Delta variant could be anywhere from 40-80% more
transmissible, he says, with 60% his âbest estimateâ. âBut thereâs still an enormous amount of uncertainty,â he
adds. In the meantime, administering as many second doses as
quickly as possible is a priority - to give people the best possible protection. As for easing final restrictions on 21 June, there is
caution from Prof Ferguson. Delaying unlocking, he says, would allow more people to be
vaccinated - and reduce the size of a third wave. But the final say rests with
the government.  Vaccines
should be prioritised for high-risk areas where there are a large number of cases
of the Delta variant, say a group of MPs and council leaders from north-west England. In a letter
to the prime minister, the group - which includes Blackburn MP Kate Hollern and
leader of Manchester City Council Sir Richard Leese - say the challenges
posed by the Delta variant are different to those faced by the country a few
months ago. Greater Manchester and Lancashire accounts for 90% of the areas with the highest infection rates in England, according to last week's data. The local leaders say with the vast majority of the most vulnerable fully vaccinated,
the âfocus should now shiftâ to areas where the likelihood of contracting the
Delta variant is greatest. The
letter calls on the government to ensure vaccines are making their way to
areas âthat need them mostâ, adding: âDoing so would not only benefit our local areas, but the national effort to contain
the spread of the Delta variant.â Around three million text messages are being sent out over this week to ask 25 to 29-year-olds to book their coronavirus vaccine through the national booking service. GPs are also set to urge the newly-eligible groups to come forward over the coming days. Text invitations, which do not expire, should appear as an alert from ""NHSvaccine"" and include a web link to the NHS website to reserve an appointment. When invited, people will be able to book at one of the 1,600 vaccination centres, pharmacies or GP sites across the country that are available through the national booking service. Vaccination centres are also popping up in places such as mosques, museums and sports stadiums. Who can book the vaccine now? Find out here. The UKâs latest
figures also show the number of people to have had one vaccine dose is now
40.7 million, while the number who have received both doses is 28.5 million. That's 77.3%
of the adult population who have had one jab, and 54.2% who have had two jabs. The UK
has recorded another 7,540 coronavirus cases,according to the latest government figures.,external That is
the highest number of daily cases reported since 26 February. The
seven-day average for cases is up by 66%, amid concerns the Delta variant is
fuelling a rise in infections. There
have also been a further six deaths within 28 days of a positive test. Today's figures compare with 4,330 cases a week ago and 12 deaths. We've got more now on the record day for vaccination bookings. When vaccine appointments opened to 25 to 29-year-olds yesterday the initial surge prompted 100,000 bookings an hour between 07:00 BST and midday, according to NHS figures. NHS chief executive Sir Simon Stevens labels it a ""Glastonbury-style"" rush for jabs - a reference to the traditional stampede to book tickets for the music festival. He says: ""The obvious enthusiasm of younger adults to get their jab has blown out of the water the suggestion that people in their 20s might not come forward to protect themselves and their loved ones."" Hitting one million bookings in a day ""sends a fantastic signal"", says Dr Emily Lawson, lead for the NHS Covid Vaccination Programme. She says it shows ""the Covid-19 vaccine is something that all of us - no matter our age â can value and be excited by and most importantly should get, when our opportunity comes."" Coronavirus vaccine bookings on the NHS website reached a record high of more than one million yesterday. It's first time daily appointments made through the national booking service have topped the million mark. As vaccines were opened up to people aged 25 to 29 yesterday morning, a total of 1,082,596 first and second dose slots were snapped up across the day online and by phone. That's about 45,000 an hour on average and more than 750 every minute, over the full 24 hours. The daily total for the National Booking Service yesterday means around four times as many slots were booked yesterday compared with the day before and the same day last week. Covid-19 testing in Northern Ireland's post-primary schools is to be extended to all pupils from this week until the end of the summer term. Previously, lateral flow device (LFD) testshad been made available to older students in years 12 to 14 onlywhere prevalence of Covid-19 tends to be higher. But for the final fortnight of term, the twice-weekly tests will be expanded to cover years eight to 11 - encompassing pupils aged 12 and upwards. NI Education Minister Peter Weir is urging schools ""to make use of their stock of LFD kits to extend the offer to all pupils in Years 8-11 for the remaining weeks of term"". ""The purpose of asymptomatic testing is to find individuals who are infected but do not realise it."" he explains. ""They can then be advised to isolate so reducing the risk of them unwittingly spreading infection in the school and elsewhere."" Read the full story. The chairs of two parliamentary select committees have written to Dominic Cummings asking him to provide documentary evidence for âseveral serious allegationsâ he made last month. In the letter, sent last week, Greg Clark and Jeremy Hunt asked for evidence for the claims Cummings made about Health Secretary Matt Hancockâs honesty. In addition, Cummings has been asked to provide text exchanges he had with the prime minister, as well as numerous ministers, officials and journalists. The pair had asked for the evidence to be provided by 4 June to allow it to be studied by their joint inquiry on coronavirus, ahead of Hancockâs appearance tomorrow. But âno evidence has been received to date from Dominic Cummingsâ by the Committee. While older people have been the most at risk from coronavirus itself, the young have disproportionately suffered from its economic fallout, according to unemployment figures. The unemployment rate among young people was 14.6% in 2020 but 5.2% for over 25s, according to the International Labour Organization (ILO). ""The young jobless have been stuck in a Covid-19 limbo-land,"" says Sher Verick, from ILO. ""This crisis has...not only led to the closure of businesses and job losses, but the lockdown measures have also severely constrained young people's ability to search for a job,"" he says. The data shows young women have generally suffered more from the economic consequences of Covid than young men and you can find out morehere. Â© 2025 BBC.

"The UK government faces a difficult choice in the next few days. Many people are desperate to see the return to normality promised by the final stage of the roadmap to lifting lockdown. But ministers always said 21 June was not set in stone - and could be affected by changes in the pandemic, including the emergence of new variants. What will they be weighing up as they make their final decision? Here are four key numbers to watch out for in the coming days. There are just under 1,000 people with coronavirus in hospitals in the UK, up about 5% from a low point a week ago. That's far below the peak of nearly 40,000 people in January. And NHS Providers say the people who are going in aren't as seriously ill as they were in early waves. They are younger, or don't require intensive care as much - and they're coming out sooner. That means this wave is different, and better, than previous ones but eventually rising admissions will mount up. In the two parts of the UK that are furthest into this ""third wave"", the North West of England and Scotland, the number of people in hospital with coronavirus is rising faster than the rest of the UK. How far and how fast this trend develops depends on how fast infections are rising and how likely you are to get seriously sick with the new variant. Health Secretary Matt Hancock told Parliament on Tuesday that the main type of coronavirus in the UK - the Delta variant first identified in India - is ""at least 40%"" more transmissible than the version that sparked the winter wave - the Alpha variant first seen in Kent. And as Delta takes over, infections are on the rise again. Last week, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) suggested thatUK infections had risen by 60% in a single week. If that growth rate remains steady or picks up, it suggests that cases will rise pretty quickly if and when society reopens further. We'll learn more on Friday. But rising infections on their own aren't a reason to extend lockdown. The government'skey test,externalis whether rising infections ""risk a surge in hospitalisations which would put unsustainable pressure on the NHS"". And that also depends on your chances of getting seriously ill if you catch coronavirus. When could social distancing end? That is much harder to predict now than it was in the first or second waves, when scientists could predict what proportion of cases would need treatment. That's because vaccines do reduce your chance of getting really sick if you do get infected with any variant. Already we can see thatwhile people who have been double jabbed make up more than 40% of the population, they make up fewer than 5% of people who have been admitted to hospitalwith the Delta variant. But it does look like it takes two doses before someone gets high levels of protection from that variant. So there's a race on: double-jab as many people as possible, before the virus spreads enough to find the vulnerable or to put pressure on the NHS. More than 50% of adults have been given the best protection possible - two doses of the vaccine. That's still a way off herd immunity, even if you add in people who have some immunity from having had coronavirus in the past. Say each infected person would, on average, pass the virus on to six other people in a fully open society that hadn't seen the virus before. Then five out of six people, not just five out of six adults, would need to be able to fight off the virus - that would be the ""herd immunity threshold"". We're not there yet, and it's possible that the threshold is higher as Delta could be more infectious than imagined in this example. But every person vaccinated helps to slow the spread. How many people have been vaccinated so far? To predict what rising infections will mean for the NHS, you need to know how fast cases will rise and how many cases will get really sick. We don't know either figure precisely, and probably won't by 14 June. And a rough estimate doesn't help. The last time UK government modellers made their forecasts, the difference between ""40% more transmissible"" (the orange line below) and ""50% more transmissible"" (the blue line below) made a huge difference to the predicted severity of a third wave. And then, to know what to do about rising cases, you need to predict what effect any change to the rules might have on spread. It's uncertainty piled on uncertainty. To know the cost of that action, you need to know what effect another few weeks of being shut, or trading at a loss, would do to the businesses that are desperate to open up. It's a mammoth task and one that will require some old-fashioned political judgement as well as hi-tech epidemiological models. LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area?

"This video can not be played Protecting trade flows east-west and north-south across the island of Ireland is ""easily doable"", says Boris Johnson The EU says its patience is ""wearing very thin"" with the UK in talks aimed at avoiding a post-Brexit trade war. Top EU official Maros Sefcovic said the UK must start checking goods entering Northern Ireland, as agreed in the 2019 Brexit ""divorce"" settlement. The UK says it is ready to ignore the rules to prevent further disruption - sparking threats of EU retaliation. Boris Johnson said a solution that protects trade flows and the peace process was ""easily doable"". And he dismissed talk of a trade war with the EU, saying he was ""not worried"" it would overshadow the G7 summit. The prime minister is in Cornwall, where he will host the leaders of the world's richest nations, including US President Joe Biden, who is said to have ""deep"" concerns that a UK-EU trade row could endanger peace in Northern Ireland. Why is there a UK-EU row over sausages? Don't imperil NI peace, Biden to warn UK and EU EU to begin legal action over NI Protocol 'breach' Asked about this, Mr Johnson said everyone needed to be ""absolutely clear"" that the purpose of the Northern Ireland protocol - the part of the Brexit deal at the centre of the row - was to ""uphold the Belfast Good Friday Agreement, to make sure that we keep the balance in relationships in Northern Ireland"". He said he was ""optimistic"" a solution could be found that ""protects the peace process, but also guarantees the economic and territorial integrity of the whole United Kingdom"". Lord Frost (L) has been discussing border issues with his EU counterpart Maros Sefcovic in central London Talks between Mr Sefcovic - a vice-president of the European Commission - and UK Brexit minister Lord Frost broke up earlier without agreement. Mr Sefcovic said he was ""positive we can find a solution"" but added: ""Our patience really is wearing very, very thin, and therefore we have to assess all options we have at our disposal."" This could include legal action, arbitration or retaliatory trade measures such as tariffs, he explained. He said ""trust"" had to be restored between the two sides, after the UK had broken the terms of the 2019 Northern Ireland protocol. A key flashpoint is a looming ban on the export of sausages and other chilled meats from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) no longer follows EU rules but Northern Ireland does - because it shares a land border with the Republic of Ireland, an EU member. EU food safety rules do not allow chilled meat products to enter its market from non-members like the UK. Frozen meat is not covered by the rules. In January, the two sides agreed a six month ""grace"" period to allow companies to set up alternative supply chains, but that runs out at the end of June. The UK has already held back from carrying out full checks on supermarket goods and parcels moving from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, prompting the EU to accuse the UK of undermining the protocol and tobegin legal proceedings. Mr Sefcovic said: ""If the UK were to take further unilateral action in the coming weeks the EU will not be shy in acting swiftly, firmly and resolutely to ensure the UK abides by its international obligations."" A UK source close to the negotiations said: ""Nobody wants to get into a trade war or anything close to it."" It was ""much better to find agreed ways forward"", added the source, and ""the people in Northern Ireland want solutions not threats"". ""But unfortunately we have got used to living in an atmosphere where there are threats."" Asked by ITV's Robert Peston if the UK would take unilateral action, Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis said ""we're not at that stage yet but we've said we will keep all options open."" There's a clash of cultures at the heart of this increasingly serious dispute. The EU is a union of laws and rules - and once it has an agreement it tends to stick to the details. The British government, on the other hand, decided to kick some of the details down the road in its desire to ""Get Brexit Done"". But those details never went away, and now they are threatening to provoke another crisis in Britain's relationship with Europe, and to destabilise Northern Ireland. During the 2019 general election campaign Boris Johnson said there would be no checks on goods moving in either direction between Great Britain and Northern Ireland as a result of his Brexit deal, even though official documents at the time made clear that there would be. Now his government says the EU needs to show more flexibility, that it's being too legalistic. The practicalities of implementing the Northern Ireland Protocol in full are certainly pretty challenging. Northern Ireland's chief vet recently told Assembly members in Belfast that it would require more checks on food than are done in the whole of the EU. And he only has 12 vets. The EU says it is prepared to be flexible, but says the UK cannot walk away from its legal obligations. Both sides talk about ""considering all our options"" if a compromise can't be found. In public at least, it's hard to see where the common ground lies. Mr Sefcovic said the EU had offered a temporary solution to the chilled meats row, ahead of a comprehensive trade deal, but he said the UK was not prepared to accept it because it would involve signing up to EU food standards. ""Ideology prevails over what is good for the people of Northern Ireland,"" he added. Northern Irish ports such as Larne have seen additional border checks under the protocol Speaking after his meeting with Mr Sefcovic, Lord Frost said the protocol was ""being implemented in a way which is causing disruption in Northern Ireland and we had some pretty frank and honest discussions about that situation"". ""There weren't any breakthroughs, there weren't any breakdowns either and we are going to carry on talking,"" he added. ""What we really now need to do is very urgently find some solutions, which support the Belfast Good Friday Agreement, Support the peace process in Northern Ireland and allow things to return to normal."" Government 'knew NI Protocol was bad deal' Can sea border âteething problemsâ be solved? Lord Frost said the EU was insisting that the two sides ""operate the protocol in an extremely purist way"" and he did not see any problem with continuing to allow exports of chilled meats. ""We don't see what risk is caused to Northern Ireland if chilled meats are imported there from GB."" Northern Ireland's deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill - who also took part in the meeting - challenged the UK government to ""honour its commitments"" on the Brexit protocol. ""Certainly there's a frustration that the British government have signed up to this agreement, however they have failed to bring forward ways to implement the Protocol in its entirety,"" she added.

"The government acted unlawfully when it awarded a Â£560,000 contract to a firm run by former colleagues of Michael Gove and the PM's adviser Dominic Cummings, the High Court has ruled. Mr Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, denied any favouritism had been shown to market research agency Public First. But the judge said a failure to consider other firms could be seen as suggesting a ""real danger"" of bias. Public First looked into public understanding of coronavirus. Campaigners took legal action against Mr Gove over the Cabinet Office's decision to use the company following the start of the pandemic last year. They also questioned the involvement of Mr Cummings, who worked in Downing Street until he quit as the prime minister's chief adviser last autumn. Lawyers for the Good Law Project argued that Mr Cummings wanted focus group and communications support services work to be given to Public First, whose founding partners were Rachel Wolf and James Frayne. In 2011, Mr Frayne became director of communications at the Department of Education, where he worked alongside Mr Cummings, who was a special adviser to Mr Gove, the then education secretary. Ms Wolf formerly worked as an adviser to Mr Gove and for Mr Cummings, and co-wrote the Conservatives' 2019 general election manifesto. Dominic Cummings said the amounts spent on focus groups had been ""trivial"" in the context of the Covid-19 crisis The government and Mr Cummings disputed the Good Law Project's claim. Delivering her ruling, Mrs Justice O'Farrell said: ""The claimant is entitled to a declaration that the decision of 5 June 2020 to award the contract to Public First gave rise to apparent bias and was unlawful."" She said: ""The defendant's failure to consider any other research agency, by reference to experience, expertise, availability or capacity, would lead a fair-minded and informed observer to conclude that there was a real possibility, or a real danger, that the decision-maker was biased."" But she also said: ""The fair-minded and informed observer would have appreciated that there was an urgent need or research through focus groups on effective communications in response to the Covid-19 crisis and that those research services were required immediately."" Mr Cummings had been ""uniquely placed, given his experience and expertise, to form a rapid view on which organisation might best be able to deliver those urgent requirements"", the judge said. The High Court rejected two other claims made against the government by the Good Law Project. The first was that the ""direct"" award of the contract to Public First was ""unnecessary"" because there were other firms who could potentially have done the work. The second was that giving it a six-month contract was ""disproportionate"" for the government's ""immediate"" needs - and that a shorter arrangement could have been followed by a ""competitive process"" for a longer contract. In his witness statement, Mr Cummings told the court: ""The country was facing an unprecedented national emergency. Thousands of lives were at stake, hundreds of billions of pounds were at stake. ""The extra money spent on doubling the focus groups and polling was essentially irrelevant in those circumstances. ""A few people did raise the question of how we could justify this as value for money. I responded that this was not the normal world, we were in a once-a-century pandemic and many thousands of pounds here was trivial if it helped us save lives and minimise economic destruction."" After the High Court ruling, he tweeted: ""When it became clear [the Department of Health, Public Health England and the Cabinet Office] weren't gathering vital data, I acted urgently. This data immediately helped key decisions and saved lives."" But Good Law Project director Jo Maugham said: ""This is not government for the public good - it is government for the good of friends of the Conservative Party."" Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner accused the government of acting ""immorally and unethically"". ""In the middle of a deadly pandemic not only were those at the heart of government giving out taxpayers' money to their friends and associates, they have wasted even more trying to cover it up,"" she added. However, a Public First spokesman said the company was ""deeply proud of the work we did in the early stages of the pandemic, which helped save lives"". He added: ""The judge rejected most of the Good Law Project's claims, not finding actual bias in the awarding of this work, nor any problems with the pace or scale of the award."" And the Cabinet Office said: ""The judgement makes clear that there was no suggestion of actual bias and that the decision to award the contract was not due to any personal or professional connections.""

"Claire MacDonald was looking forward to a trip to Portugal with her family when the first lockdown was imposed in March 2020. She and her husband booked the Ryanair tickets at the beginning of the year, but found themselves in a situation where legally they couldn't fly. However, Ryanair declined to give them a refund, and instead they had to rebook, incurring extra costs. Claire said the situation was ""incredibly frustrating"". The MacDonalds had paid Â£1,000 for the flights for themselves and their two children, but were refused a refund, and were told they would lose their money unless they paid an extra Â£300 to rebook. ""This is an utter disgrace that Ryanair charged us for this,"" Claire told the BBC. ""They [Ryanair] can say: 'The flight took off and you weren't on it. It's your problem.'"" To make matters worse, the family are now due to fly out to Portugal in two weeks time - but given the government is still advising not to travel to amber destinations for leisure, they do not want to go. ""Ryanair still will not issue a refund,"" said Claire who lives in Edinburgh. ""So we are due to lose Â£1,300 now and I am currently furloughed. Where is the justice here? I feel pretty despondent and angry to say the least."" Customers spoke out after a watchdog started an investigation into whether Ryanair and British Airways had broken the law in not offering refunds to customers who couldn't legally take flights due to Covid lockdowns. Travel firms warned over summer holiday refunds Watchdog threatens legal action on holiday refunds The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said the airlines' stance may have left customers out of pocket. The airlines offered other options, but both refused refunds, it said. However, BA said it had acted lawfully and Ryanair said it had refunded customers in justified cases. Andy Watts says it is 'morally wrong' for Ryanair not to give a refund Andy Watts, a sheet-metal worker from Nottingham, booked a holiday for his family of four to travel to Alicante for August 2020 with flights costing Â£1,200. However, they then got a letter from their GP saying his eldest daughter, then 12, should shield for medical reasons. ""This cut no ice with Ryanair,"" he said. The family was ""forced"" to transfer the flights to August this year at a cost of Â£860. ""I now believe those flights for us are very unlikely to happen as Spain will remain an amber country,"" he said. ""We looked at transferring again, due to the uncertainty, to next year 2022 but can only transfer up until Christmas 2021 at an additional cost of Â£300."" Andy now stands to be more than Â£2,000 out of pocket and has the choice to either walk away from the trip or book more flights not knowing if he'll be able to use them. ""It's pretty disgusting,"" Andy said. ""The government advice is that you shouldn't travel. It's poor customer service, and it's morally wrong."" During the three UK lockdowns people were told to avoid all non-essential travel. The CMA's investigation is looking at flights that weren't cancelled, but that people legally could not go on due to lockdown restrictions. The watchdog said that while BA had offered vouchers and rebooking for flights that weren't cancelled, and Ryanair had offered rebooking, both had declined refunds. Andrea Coscelli, chief executive of the CMA, said: ""While we understand that airlines have had a tough time during the pandemic, people should not be left unfairly out of pocket for following the law. ""Customers booked these flights in good faith and were legally unable to take them due to circumstances entirely outside of their control. We believe these people should have been offered their money back."" The watchdog is concerned that during lockdowns in the UK, when most people were legally unable to fly, the airlines failed to offer refunds. It said it wanted to resolve those concerns, which might include the airlines offering affected customers refunds ""or other redress"". The CMA has sent a letter to the companies outlining its concerns. Usually the watchdog tries to work with firms to address any issues. However, if the firms push back, it can seek a court order to compel them to refund customers and make changes to their practices. The CMA cannot fine the firms if it is found they breached consumer law - which is different to its powers in competition cases, where it can levy fines. But BA said it offered ""highly flexible booking policies at the same time as operating a vastly reduced schedule due to government-imposed travel restrictions, and we have acted lawfully at all times"". A spokesperson said: ""During this unprecedented crisis we have issued well over three million refunds and helped millions of our customers change their travel dates or destinations and we're grateful to them for their ongoing support. ""It is incredible that the government is seeking to punish further an industry that is on its knees, after prohibiting airlines from meaningful flying for well over a year now."" Covid: What refund rights are there for holidays abroad? Ryanair said it had looked at refunds on a case-by-case basis and had paid money back ""in justified cases"". ""Since June 2020, all our customers have also had the ability to rebook their flights without paying a change fee and millions of our UK customers have availed of this option,"" it said. The CMA has been investigating various parts of the travel industry, following complaints about refunds, cancellations and price rises during the pandemic. It has received 148,000 complaints so far, with many thousands of those being about holiday refunds. In April itthreatened legal actionagainst firms offering vouchers instead of refunds for accommodation. Then in May itwarned travel companiesthat they needed to be ready to refund customers, and said that five big package holiday firms including Tui, Lastminute.com and Virgin Holidays had refunded a total of Â£200m.

"Amanda Bellwood, a part-time worker, has been on furlough since the UK's first coronavirus lockdown and fears she will never return to the company where she has worked for 20 years. The 57-year-old, who is not using her real name, says she is ""certain"" she'll be made redundant in July, when the governmentwill reduce the proportion of people's wages it pays to 70% and employers will have to pay 10% for hours not worked. ""I feel cast aside. No one has touched base with me or said even said 'hi' in over a year,"" says the grandmother-of-three, who works for a pen manufacturing and sales company. ""It seems to me that lots of businesses are getting rid of their part-timers, scaling down on more experienced personnel and keeping on to junior staff, to save costs."" According to flexible working campaigners Timewise, Mrs Bellwood is not alone in fearing redundancy. The consultancy is warning that the UK's 7.8 million part-time workers, most of whom are women, will bear the brunt of job losses when the furlough scheme ends in September. A study commissioned by Timewise found that half of all part-time workers had been furloughed at one point during the pandemic, compared to a third of full-time employees. Meanwhile, part-time employment has fallen at its fastest rate in at least 30 years during the crisis, with the share of women working part-time at its lowest since records began. Research suggests part-time workers have been hit hardest by the pandemic Emma Stewart, Timewise's director of development, says employees feel like they are ""clinging on to jobs that will soon disappear"". She says part-time workers could ""effectively be locked out of work"" after analysis of job adverts revealed just 8% of UK job vacancies are advertised as part-time. Mrs Bellwood, from Hitchin, Hertfordshire, says working part-time is ""crucial"" to her supporting her children by looking after and spending time with her grandchildren. She says she has found searching for part-time roles ""demoralising"" and ""all very impersonal"" after sending off hundreds of applications with no reply. ""My husband was made redundant last October, he worked for a removal business for 35 years,"" she says. ""Suddenly, we face an uncertain future and it's frightening. I know so many people like me. Over 50, who have lost their part-time jobs."" Timewise says that in 2020, 44% of part-time workers who were classified as being ""away from work"" - or on furlough - during the first lockdown continued to be away between July and September. That compares to about a third of full-time workers. Tony Wilson, director of Institute for Employment Studies, says part-time workers have been ""hit harder"" by successive lockdowns and are taking on full-time jobs to ""make up for lost earnings"" - both factors driving the fall in part-time roles. ""Either way, the signs are that far from heralding a new era of flexible working, this recovery may see far fewer people getting the hours and the flexibility that they need,"" he says. Office for National Statisticsfigures,externalshow 7.8 million people were employed part-time between January and March this year compared to 8.7 million in the same period last year. The number of women employed part-time fell from 6.4 million to 5.7 million. Kelly Burns, who does not want to use her real name, says it shocked her that it was so hard to find a part-time job after she was made redundant last July.

Here's a round-up of the main headlines today: This video can not be played Free Hugs: Does Covid mean the end of hugging strangers? The Covid pandemic put a stop to the Free Hugs movement - with social distancing guidelines and restrictions in place in countries around the world. The group used to offer hugs to strangers every weekend - but they say any decision to relax social distancing should be treated with caution. BBC health reporter, Laura Foster, spoke to some members of Free Hugs UK about the importance of hugs and when they might be able to freely hug again. The Penta Hotel in Reading's Oxford Rd opened as a quarantine facility on 29 April A local council has called on the government to shut a quarantine hotel in Reading after a total of 44 positive cases of Covid-19 were identified among residents and staff. Reading Council says it is ""unconvinced"" the outbreak is under control or that robust safety measures are in place. The quarantine facility, run by the Department of Health and Social Care, opened on 29 April. Reading Borough Council says it was notified of the first Covid outbreak on 9 May. The local authority says cases have spread ""between guests, and hotel and security staff"". It says it believes at least three cases in the community have been directly linked to the hotel's outbreak and the spread ""could have been avoided had the correct safety procedures been in place"" at the outset. The majority of the positive cases have been identified as the Delta variant. The Department for Health and Social Care has been approached for comment. Prime Minister Boris Johnson says itâs
too early to say if England's lockdown can end on 21 June as data on whether
the vaccine rollout offers enough protection from the Delta variant is still being assessed. ""On Monday... we'll have a look
at where we are. I think what everybody can see very clearly is that cases are
going up, and in some places hospitalisations are going up,"" he says, speaking in Cornwall ahead of the G7 conference. ""What we need to assess is the
extent to which the vaccine rollout - which has been phenomenal - has built up
protection in the population in order for us to go ahead to the next stage. And
so that's what we'll be looking at."" As we reported earlier, the UK has recorded another 7,540 coronavirus cases over the past 24 hours - the highest number of daily cases reported since the end of February. Cases have risen dramatically over the past week, with a seven-day average of 5,984 - as the Delta variant continues to make its presence felt. But the number of cases is still far off the peak in January - and daily deaths remain low: on Wednesday, data showed a further six deaths within 28 days of a positive test - compared with 12 deaths a week ago. Scientists attribute the fall in both hospitalisations and deaths to the success of the vaccine rollout. More than half the adult population - 54.2% - are now fully vaccinated, while 77.3% have had one jab.   High school pupils in Scotland retuned to face-to-face lessons after the Easter holidays The number of Covid infections recorded among children in Scotland is now at the highest level it has been since the start of the outbreak. Weekly infections among children aged up to 14 reached 1,064 on 7 June - higher than the peak in early January, according to Public Health Scotland. While there is no evidence children are becoming seriously ill - with no significant rise in hospital admissions - growing numbers of pupils are off school. Provisional figures indicate 15,687 pupils were absent for Covid-related reasons at the end of last week, with overall attendance dropping to 87.8%. Data shows a four-fold increase in cases among children under 15, but infection rates are still considerably higher among young adults and older teenagers. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said Scotland will move quickly to vaccinate 12-15 year olds if recommended by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation. Read the full story. A number of government reviews are currently under way looking at Covid-19 measures in England. Their findings will inform wider policy forstep four of the roadmap plan,external- which will happen on 21 June at the earliest, butcould be delayed past then. What
reviews are there?  Find out morehere. Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics The number of people in
hospital with coronavirus is on the rise again and reached 1,024 on Monday 7 June,
rising above 1,000 for the first time since mid-May. Back then, numbers were
falling and they reached a low point of just under 870 on 27 May. But they have risen by nearly
20% in the 11 days since then. This is still far below the
peak in Januaryâs wave when nearly 40,000 people were in hospital with
coronavirus in the UK. And people in the NHS say the cases theyâre seeing now are less serious than in previous waves. But they underline the inevitable
impact of the rising case numbers that we have been seeing in the UK. The rises in people in
hospital are driven by increasing numbers of people in hospital in Scotland and
the North West of England, the region and nation where cases have been rising
for the longest in the UK in the early stages of this third wave. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Traffic control measures have been imposed in parts of Guangzhou in an attempt to limit the spread of the virus In the past 24
hours, China has confirmed eight new domestic symptomatic cases of Covid-19,
all in southern Guangdong province. This is the
only area of mainland China where there is currently an outbreak; 164 people
are currently in hospital across the province. Most patients are in the
populous city of Guangzhou, which along with the nearby city of Foshan and
Wuchuan County, has local lockdowns in place. Guangzhou is
one of Chinaâs biggest cities, and as cases of mutant variants have been
detected, there have been some fears that it could see a large-scale outbreak,
like those seen in the cities ofWuhanorShijiazhuang. However, huge
vaccine uptake has helped China avoid a third wave â more than 800 million
vaccine doses have now been administeredacross the country,externaland recent media reports have suggested new patients have exhibited mild or no
symptoms. Even with
triple-digit cases, tens of thousands of students have still been able to sit
their university entrance exams in Guangzhou this week. This would have been
unthinkable during earlier outbreaks â Chinaâs approach to date has been to
swiftly lock down communities and order mass testing drives, allowing people
very little room for manoeuvre. But vaccination uptake has helped China relax
its Covid-19 regulations. Local governments have been increasingly finding safe
ways for events to go ahead, rather than simply cancelling them. It is still
not clear how this latest outbreak began. Health officials in Guangzhou say the genetic sequencing of cases in the city show a 98% similarity,
suggesting they are all linked to the same chain of transmission. A local
health commission official tells the official CCTV broadcasterâmore investigation is needed to identify patient zeroâ,external. Philippa RoxbyHealth reporter, BBC News There are still many unknowns about the Delta variant, first
detected in India, which is causing a worrying rise in cases and hospital
admissions in some areas of the UK. Overall, the virus is still at low levels â but there is now
clear concern from scientists that a third wave could be on its way. Prof Neil Ferguson, virus modeller from Imperial College
London, tells journalists the size and scale of that wave depends on how
effective the vaccines are at protecting against illness from the Delta
variant. That still isnât clear and more data needs to be collected. The Delta variant could be anywhere from 40-80% more
transmissible, he says, with 60% his âbest estimateâ. âBut thereâs still an enormous amount of uncertainty,â he
adds. In the meantime, administering as many second doses as
quickly as possible is a priority - to give people the best possible protection. As for easing final restrictions on 21 June, there is
caution from Prof Ferguson. Delaying unlocking, he says, would allow more people to be
vaccinated - and reduce the size of a third wave. But the final say rests with
the government.  Vaccines
should be prioritised for high-risk areas where there are a large number of cases
of the Delta variant, say a group of MPs and council leaders from north-west England. In a letter
to the prime minister, the group - which includes Blackburn MP Kate Hollern and
leader of Manchester City Council Sir Richard Leese - say the challenges
posed by the Delta variant are different to those faced by the country a few
months ago. Greater Manchester and Lancashire accounts for 90% of the areas with the highest infection rates in England, according to last week's data. The local leaders say with the vast majority of the most vulnerable fully vaccinated,
the âfocus should now shiftâ to areas where the likelihood of contracting the
Delta variant is greatest. The
letter calls on the government to ensure vaccines are making their way to
areas âthat need them mostâ, adding: âDoing so would not only benefit our local areas, but the national effort to contain
the spread of the Delta variant.â Around three million text messages are being sent out over this week to ask 25 to 29-year-olds to book their coronavirus vaccine through the national booking service. GPs are also set to urge the newly-eligible groups to come forward over the coming days. Text invitations, which do not expire, should appear as an alert from ""NHSvaccine"" and include a web link to the NHS website to reserve an appointment. When invited, people will be able to book at one of the 1,600 vaccination centres, pharmacies or GP sites across the country that are available through the national booking service. Vaccination centres are also popping up in places such as mosques, museums and sports stadiums. Who can book the vaccine now? Find out here. The UKâs latest
figures also show the number of people to have had one vaccine dose is now
40.7 million, while the number who have received both doses is 28.5 million. That's 77.3%
of the adult population who have had one jab, and 54.2% who have had two jabs. The UK
has recorded another 7,540 coronavirus cases,according to the latest government figures.,external That is
the highest number of daily cases reported since 26 February. The
seven-day average for cases is up by 66%, amid concerns the Delta variant is
fuelling a rise in infections. There
have also been a further six deaths within 28 days of a positive test. Today's figures compare with 4,330 cases a week ago and 12 deaths. We've got more now on the record day for vaccination bookings. When vaccine appointments opened to 25 to 29-year-olds yesterday the initial surge prompted 100,000 bookings an hour between 07:00 BST and midday, according to NHS figures. NHS chief executive Sir Simon Stevens labels it a ""Glastonbury-style"" rush for jabs - a reference to the traditional stampede to book tickets for the music festival. He says: ""The obvious enthusiasm of younger adults to get their jab has blown out of the water the suggestion that people in their 20s might not come forward to protect themselves and their loved ones."" Hitting one million bookings in a day ""sends a fantastic signal"", says Dr Emily Lawson, lead for the NHS Covid Vaccination Programme. She says it shows ""the Covid-19 vaccine is something that all of us - no matter our age â can value and be excited by and most importantly should get, when our opportunity comes."" Coronavirus vaccine bookings on the NHS website reached a record high of more than one million yesterday. It's first time daily appointments made through the national booking service have topped the million mark. As vaccines were opened up to people aged 25 to 29 yesterday morning, a total of 1,082,596 first and second dose slots were snapped up across the day online and by phone. That's about 45,000 an hour on average and more than 750 every minute, over the full 24 hours. The daily total for the National Booking Service yesterday means around four times as many slots were booked yesterday compared with the day before and the same day last week. Covid-19 testing in Northern Ireland's post-primary schools is to be extended to all pupils from this week until the end of the summer term. Previously, lateral flow device (LFD) testshad been made available to older students in years 12 to 14 onlywhere prevalence of Covid-19 tends to be higher. But for the final fortnight of term, the twice-weekly tests will be expanded to cover years eight to 11 - encompassing pupils aged 12 and upwards. NI Education Minister Peter Weir is urging schools ""to make use of their stock of LFD kits to extend the offer to all pupils in Years 8-11 for the remaining weeks of term"". ""The purpose of asymptomatic testing is to find individuals who are infected but do not realise it."" he explains. ""They can then be advised to isolate so reducing the risk of them unwittingly spreading infection in the school and elsewhere."" Read the full story. The chairs of two parliamentary select committees have written to Dominic Cummings asking him to provide documentary evidence for âseveral serious allegationsâ he made last month. In the letter, sent last week, Greg Clark and Jeremy Hunt asked for evidence for the claims Cummings made about Health Secretary Matt Hancockâs honesty. In addition, Cummings has been asked to provide text exchanges he had with the prime minister, as well as numerous ministers, officials and journalists. The pair had asked for the evidence to be provided by 4 June to allow it to be studied by their joint inquiry on coronavirus, ahead of Hancockâs appearance tomorrow. But âno evidence has been received to date from Dominic Cummingsâ by the Committee. While older people have been the most at risk from coronavirus itself, the young have disproportionately suffered from its economic fallout, according to unemployment figures. The unemployment rate among young people was 14.6% in 2020 but 5.2% for over 25s, according to the International Labour Organization (ILO). ""The young jobless have been stuck in a Covid-19 limbo-land,"" says Sher Verick, from ILO. ""This crisis has...not only led to the closure of businesses and job losses, but the lockdown measures have also severely constrained young people's ability to search for a job,"" he says. The data shows young women have generally suffered more from the economic consequences of Covid than young men and you can find out morehere. Â© 2025 BBC.

"This video can not be played Protecting trade flows east-west and north-south across the island of Ireland is ""easily doable"", says Boris Johnson The EU says its patience is ""wearing very thin"" with the UK in talks aimed at avoiding a post-Brexit trade war. Top EU official Maros Sefcovic said the UK must start checking goods entering Northern Ireland, as agreed in the 2019 Brexit ""divorce"" settlement. The UK says it is ready to ignore the rules to prevent further disruption - sparking threats of EU retaliation. Boris Johnson said a solution that protects trade flows and the peace process was ""easily doable"". And he dismissed talk of a trade war with the EU, saying he was ""not worried"" it would overshadow the G7 summit. The prime minister is in Cornwall, where he will host the leaders of the world's richest nations, including US President Joe Biden, who is said to have ""deep"" concerns that a UK-EU trade row could endanger peace in Northern Ireland. Why is there a UK-EU row over sausages? Don't imperil NI peace, Biden to warn UK and EU EU to begin legal action over NI Protocol 'breach' Asked about this, Mr Johnson said everyone needed to be ""absolutely clear"" that the purpose of the Northern Ireland protocol - the part of the Brexit deal at the centre of the row - was to ""uphold the Belfast Good Friday Agreement, to make sure that we keep the balance in relationships in Northern Ireland"". He said he was ""optimistic"" a solution could be found that ""protects the peace process, but also guarantees the economic and territorial integrity of the whole United Kingdom"". Lord Frost (L) has been discussing border issues with his EU counterpart Maros Sefcovic in central London Talks between Mr Sefcovic - a vice-president of the European Commission - and UK Brexit minister Lord Frost broke up earlier without agreement. Mr Sefcovic said he was ""positive we can find a solution"" but added: ""Our patience really is wearing very, very thin, and therefore we have to assess all options we have at our disposal."" This could include legal action, arbitration or retaliatory trade measures such as tariffs, he explained. He said ""trust"" had to be restored between the two sides, after the UK had broken the terms of the 2019 Northern Ireland protocol. A key flashpoint is a looming ban on the export of sausages and other chilled meats from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) no longer follows EU rules but Northern Ireland does - because it shares a land border with the Republic of Ireland, an EU member. EU food safety rules do not allow chilled meat products to enter its market from non-members like the UK. Frozen meat is not covered by the rules. In January, the two sides agreed a six month ""grace"" period to allow companies to set up alternative supply chains, but that runs out at the end of June. The UK has already held back from carrying out full checks on supermarket goods and parcels moving from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, prompting the EU to accuse the UK of undermining the protocol and tobegin legal proceedings. Mr Sefcovic said: ""If the UK were to take further unilateral action in the coming weeks the EU will not be shy in acting swiftly, firmly and resolutely to ensure the UK abides by its international obligations."" A UK source close to the negotiations said: ""Nobody wants to get into a trade war or anything close to it."" It was ""much better to find agreed ways forward"", added the source, and ""the people in Northern Ireland want solutions not threats"". ""But unfortunately we have got used to living in an atmosphere where there are threats."" Asked by ITV's Robert Peston if the UK would take unilateral action, Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis said ""we're not at that stage yet but we've said we will keep all options open."" There's a clash of cultures at the heart of this increasingly serious dispute. The EU is a union of laws and rules - and once it has an agreement it tends to stick to the details. The British government, on the other hand, decided to kick some of the details down the road in its desire to ""Get Brexit Done"". But those details never went away, and now they are threatening to provoke another crisis in Britain's relationship with Europe, and to destabilise Northern Ireland. During the 2019 general election campaign Boris Johnson said there would be no checks on goods moving in either direction between Great Britain and Northern Ireland as a result of his Brexit deal, even though official documents at the time made clear that there would be. Now his government says the EU needs to show more flexibility, that it's being too legalistic. The practicalities of implementing the Northern Ireland Protocol in full are certainly pretty challenging. Northern Ireland's chief vet recently told Assembly members in Belfast that it would require more checks on food than are done in the whole of the EU. And he only has 12 vets. The EU says it is prepared to be flexible, but says the UK cannot walk away from its legal obligations. Both sides talk about ""considering all our options"" if a compromise can't be found. In public at least, it's hard to see where the common ground lies. Mr Sefcovic said the EU had offered a temporary solution to the chilled meats row, ahead of a comprehensive trade deal, but he said the UK was not prepared to accept it because it would involve signing up to EU food standards. ""Ideology prevails over what is good for the people of Northern Ireland,"" he added. Northern Irish ports such as Larne have seen additional border checks under the protocol Speaking after his meeting with Mr Sefcovic, Lord Frost said the protocol was ""being implemented in a way which is causing disruption in Northern Ireland and we had some pretty frank and honest discussions about that situation"". ""There weren't any breakthroughs, there weren't any breakdowns either and we are going to carry on talking,"" he added. ""What we really now need to do is very urgently find some solutions, which support the Belfast Good Friday Agreement, Support the peace process in Northern Ireland and allow things to return to normal."" Government 'knew NI Protocol was bad deal' Can sea border âteething problemsâ be solved? Lord Frost said the EU was insisting that the two sides ""operate the protocol in an extremely purist way"" and he did not see any problem with continuing to allow exports of chilled meats. ""We don't see what risk is caused to Northern Ireland if chilled meats are imported there from GB."" Northern Ireland's deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill - who also took part in the meeting - challenged the UK government to ""honour its commitments"" on the Brexit protocol. ""Certainly there's a frustration that the British government have signed up to this agreement, however they have failed to bring forward ways to implement the Protocol in its entirety,"" she added.

"Harry has previously said of his grandmother: ""She's my colonel-in-chief, right? She always will be"" The Queen was not asked by the Duke and Duchess of Sussex about naming their daughter Lilibet, a Palace source has told the BBC. The source disputed reports in the wake of the announcement of the name that Prince Harry and Meghan had spoken to the Queen before the birth. But a Sussexes' spokesperson insisted they would not have used the name had the Queen not been supportive. They said the monarch was the first family member the duke had called. The spokesperson said: ""The duke spoke with his family in advance of the announcement - in fact his grandmother was the first family member he called. ""During that conversation, he shared their hope of naming their daughter Lilibet in her honour. Had she not been supportive, they would not have used the name."" In a letter to some news broadcasters and publishers, the law firm Schillings, which acts for Prince Harry and Meghan, said the BBC report that the Queen was not asked for permission to use the name Lilibet was false and defamatory and should not be repeated. Lilibet has been the Queen's nickname among family since her childhood. 12 claims from Meghan's Oprah interview Harry: I want to break cycle of pain for my family Royal Family tree and line of succession The relationship between the couple and the Royal Family has made headlines in recent months. Earlier this year, while the couple were expecting their daughter, they aired criticisms of the Royal Family and made an allegation of racism inan explosive interview with Oprah Winfrey. And although Harry spoke about difficulties between him and his father, he said that he had a ""really good"" relationship with the Queen and they spoke regularly over video call. At the weekend,the couple announcedthat Lilibet ""Lili"" Diana Mountbatten-Windsor had been born at a hospital in Santa Barbara in California on Friday morning. The name ""Lilibet"" is heavy with personal history for Her Majesty. The nickname was coined when then-Princess Elizabeth was just a toddler and couldn't pronounce her own name properly. Her grandfather King George V would affectionately call her Lilibet, imitating her  attempts to say her name. It stuck and came to be used by close relatives. She signed her name as Lilibet on the funeral wreath for one of her closest friends Earl Mountbatten. The Queen's late husband, the Duke of Edinburgh, also called her by the nickname. The Queen, pictured here with her grandparents in 1932, was called Lilibet by her grandfather King George V Following Lilibet's birth, it was widely presumed that Harry and Meghan had first spoken to the Queen about the choice of name. There were subsequent stories in the press quoting ""friends"" of the couple who strongly suggested that Harry had sought permission from his grandmother. The Times also reported,externalthat it understood the Queen had been informed by Harry about the name. And a source close to the Sussexes also told the BBC that Harry had spoken to the Queen before the birth and ""would have mentioned the name"" - claims a Palace source has since disputed. The couple's first son, Archie, was born in the UK before they moved across the Atlantic Lilibet is the Queen's 11th great-grandchild and younger sister to Archie, who is now two years old. Her middle name, Diana, is a tribute to Prince Harry's late mother. Princess Charlotte, the daughter of Prince William and Catherine, also has Diana as one of her middle names, as well as Elizabeth. After her birth, Buckingham Palace said the Queen and other senior royals had been informed and were ""delighted with the news"". During the interview with Oprah in March, the couple said they would be done after baby number two - meaning they were not planning to have any more children.

It says it believes at least three cases in the community have been directly linked to the hotel's outbreak and the spread ""could have been avoided had the correct safety procedures been in place"" at the outset. The majority of the positive cases have been identified as the Delta variant. The Department for Health and Social Care has been approached for comment. Prime Minister Boris Johnson says itâs
too early to say if England's lockdown can end on 21 June as data on whether
the vaccine rollout offers enough protection from the Delta variant is still being assessed. ""On Monday... we'll have a look
at where we are. I think what everybody can see very clearly is that cases are
going up, and in some places hospitalisations are going up,"" he says, speaking in Cornwall ahead of the G7 conference. ""What we need to assess is the
extent to which the vaccine rollout - which has been phenomenal - has built up
protection in the population in order for us to go ahead to the next stage. And
so that's what we'll be looking at."" As we reported earlier, the UK has recorded another 7,540 coronavirus cases over the past 24 hours - the highest number of daily cases reported since the end of February. Cases have risen dramatically over the past week, with a seven-day average of 5,984 - as the Delta variant continues to make its presence felt. But the number of cases is still far off the peak in January - and daily deaths remain low: on Wednesday, data showed a further six deaths within 28 days of a positive test - compared with 12 deaths a week ago. Scientists attribute the fall in both hospitalisations and deaths to the success of the vaccine rollout. More than half the adult population - 54.2% - are now fully vaccinated, while 77.3% have had one jab.   High school pupils in Scotland retuned to face-to-face lessons after the Easter holidays The number of Covid infections recorded among children in Scotland is now at the highest level it has been since the start of the outbreak. Weekly infections among children aged up to 14 reached 1,064 on 7 June - higher than the peak in early January, according to Public Health Scotland. While there is no evidence children are becoming seriously ill - with no significant rise in hospital admissions - growing numbers of pupils are off school. Provisional figures indicate 15,687 pupils were absent for Covid-related reasons at the end of last week, with overall attendance dropping to 87.8%. Data shows a four-fold increase in cases among children under 15, but infection rates are still considerably higher among young adults and older teenagers. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said Scotland will move quickly to vaccinate 12-15 year olds if recommended by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation. Read the full story. A number of government reviews are currently under way looking at Covid-19 measures in England. Their findings will inform wider policy forstep four of the roadmap plan,external- which will happen on 21 June at the earliest, butcould be delayed past then. What
reviews are there?  Find out morehere. Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics The number of people in
hospital with coronavirus is on the rise again and reached 1,024 on Monday 7 June,
rising above 1,000 for the first time since mid-May. Back then, numbers were
falling and they reached a low point of just under 870 on 27 May. But they have risen by nearly
20% in the 11 days since then. This is still far below the
peak in Januaryâs wave when nearly 40,000 people were in hospital with
coronavirus in the UK. And people in the NHS say the cases theyâre seeing now are less serious than in previous waves. But they underline the inevitable
impact of the rising case numbers that we have been seeing in the UK. The rises in people in
hospital are driven by increasing numbers of people in hospital in Scotland and
the North West of England, the region and nation where cases have been rising
for the longest in the UK in the early stages of this third wave. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Traffic control measures have been imposed in parts of Guangzhou in an attempt to limit the spread of the virus In the past 24
hours, China has confirmed eight new domestic symptomatic cases of Covid-19,
all in southern Guangdong province. This is the
only area of mainland China where there is currently an outbreak; 164 people
are currently in hospital across the province. Most patients are in the
populous city of Guangzhou, which along with the nearby city of Foshan and
Wuchuan County, has local lockdowns in place. Guangzhou is
one of Chinaâs biggest cities, and as cases of mutant variants have been
detected, there have been some fears that it could see a large-scale outbreak,
like those seen in the cities ofWuhanorShijiazhuang. However, huge
vaccine uptake has helped China avoid a third wave â more than 800 million
vaccine doses have now been administeredacross the country,externaland recent media reports have suggested new patients have exhibited mild or no
symptoms. Even with
triple-digit cases, tens of thousands of students have still been able to sit
their university entrance exams in Guangzhou this week. This would have been
unthinkable during earlier outbreaks â Chinaâs approach to date has been to
swiftly lock down communities and order mass testing drives, allowing people
very little room for manoeuvre. But vaccination uptake has helped China relax
its Covid-19 regulations. Local governments have been increasingly finding safe
ways for events to go ahead, rather than simply cancelling them. It is still
not clear how this latest outbreak began. Health officials in Guangzhou say the genetic sequencing of cases in the city show a 98% similarity,
suggesting they are all linked to the same chain of transmission. A local
health commission official tells the official CCTV broadcasterâmore investigation is needed to identify patient zeroâ,external. Philippa RoxbyHealth reporter, BBC News There are still many unknowns about the Delta variant, first
detected in India, which is causing a worrying rise in cases and hospital
admissions in some areas of the UK. Overall, the virus is still at low levels â but there is now
clear concern from scientists that a third wave could be on its way. Prof Neil Ferguson, virus modeller from Imperial College
London, tells journalists the size and scale of that wave depends on how
effective the vaccines are at protecting against illness from the Delta
variant. That still isnât clear and more data needs to be collected. The Delta variant could be anywhere from 40-80% more
transmissible, he says, with 60% his âbest estimateâ. âBut thereâs still an enormous amount of uncertainty,â he
adds. In the meantime, administering as many second doses as
quickly as possible is a priority - to give people the best possible protection. As for easing final restrictions on 21 June, there is
caution from Prof Ferguson. Delaying unlocking, he says, would allow more people to be
vaccinated - and reduce the size of a third wave. But the final say rests with
the government.  Vaccines
should be prioritised for high-risk areas where there are a large number of cases
of the Delta variant, say a group of MPs and council leaders from north-west England. In a letter
to the prime minister, the group - which includes Blackburn MP Kate Hollern and
leader of Manchester City Council Sir Richard Leese - say the challenges
posed by the Delta variant are different to those faced by the country a few
months ago. Greater Manchester and Lancashire accounts for 90% of the areas with the highest infection rates in England, according to last week's data. The local leaders say with the vast majority of the most vulnerable fully vaccinated,
the âfocus should now shiftâ to areas where the likelihood of contracting the
Delta variant is greatest. The
letter calls on the government to ensure vaccines are making their way to
areas âthat need them mostâ, adding: âDoing so would not only benefit our local areas, but the national effort to contain
the spread of the Delta variant.â Around three million text messages are being sent out over this week to ask 25 to 29-year-olds to book their coronavirus vaccine through the national booking service. GPs are also set to urge the newly-eligible groups to come forward over the coming days. Text invitations, which do not expire, should appear as an alert from ""NHSvaccine"" and include a web link to the NHS website to reserve an appointment. When invited, people will be able to book at one of the 1,600 vaccination centres, pharmacies or GP sites across the country that are available through the national booking service. Vaccination centres are also popping up in places such as mosques, museums and sports stadiums. Who can book the vaccine now? Find out here. The UKâs latest
figures also show the number of people to have had one vaccine dose is now
40.7 million, while the number who have received both doses is 28.5 million. That's 77.3%
of the adult population who have had one jab, and 54.2% who have had two jabs. The UK
has recorded another 7,540 coronavirus cases,according to the latest government figures.,external That is
the highest number of daily cases reported since 26 February. The
seven-day average for cases is up by 66%, amid concerns the Delta variant is
fuelling a rise in infections. There
have also been a further six deaths within 28 days of a positive test. Today's figures compare with 4,330 cases a week ago and 12 deaths. We've got more now on the record day for vaccination bookings. When vaccine appointments opened to 25 to 29-year-olds yesterday the initial surge prompted 100,000 bookings an hour between 07:00 BST and midday, according to NHS figures. NHS chief executive Sir Simon Stevens labels it a ""Glastonbury-style"" rush for jabs - a reference to the traditional stampede to book tickets for the music festival. He says: ""The obvious enthusiasm of younger adults to get their jab has blown out of the water the suggestion that people in their 20s might not come forward to protect themselves and their loved ones."" Hitting one million bookings in a day ""sends a fantastic signal"", says Dr Emily Lawson, lead for the NHS Covid Vaccination Programme. She says it shows ""the Covid-19 vaccine is something that all of us - no matter our age â can value and be excited by and most importantly should get, when our opportunity comes."" Coronavirus vaccine bookings on the NHS website reached a record high of more than one million yesterday. It's first time daily appointments made through the national booking service have topped the million mark. As vaccines were opened up to people aged 25 to 29 yesterday morning, a total of 1,082,596 first and second dose slots were snapped up across the day online and by phone. That's about 45,000 an hour on average and more than 750 every minute, over the full 24 hours. The daily total for the National Booking Service yesterday means around four times as many slots were booked yesterday compared with the day before and the same day last week. Covid-19 testing in Northern Ireland's post-primary schools is to be extended to all pupils from this week until the end of the summer term. Previously, lateral flow device (LFD) testshad been made available to older students in years 12 to 14 onlywhere prevalence of Covid-19 tends to be higher. But for the final fortnight of term, the twice-weekly tests will be expanded to cover years eight to 11 - encompassing pupils aged 12 and upwards. NI Education Minister Peter Weir is urging schools ""to make use of their stock of LFD kits to extend the offer to all pupils in Years 8-11 for the remaining weeks of term"". ""The purpose of asymptomatic testing is to find individuals who are infected but do not realise it."" he explains. ""They can then be advised to isolate so reducing the risk of them unwittingly spreading infection in the school and elsewhere."" Read the full story. The chairs of two parliamentary select committees have written to Dominic Cummings asking him to provide documentary evidence for âseveral serious allegationsâ he made last month. In the letter, sent last week, Greg Clark and Jeremy Hunt asked for evidence for the claims Cummings made about Health Secretary Matt Hancockâs honesty. In addition, Cummings has been asked to provide text exchanges he had with the prime minister, as well as numerous ministers, officials and journalists. The pair had asked for the evidence to be provided by 4 June to allow it to be studied by their joint inquiry on coronavirus, ahead of Hancockâs appearance tomorrow. But âno evidence has been received to date from Dominic Cummingsâ by the Committee. While older people have been the most at risk from coronavirus itself, the young have disproportionately suffered from its economic fallout, according to unemployment figures. The unemployment rate among young people was 14.6% in 2020 but 5.2% for over 25s, according to the International Labour Organization (ILO). ""The young jobless have been stuck in a Covid-19 limbo-land,"" says Sher Verick, from ILO. ""This crisis has...not only led to the closure of businesses and job losses, but the lockdown measures have also severely constrained young people's ability to search for a job,"" he says.

Weekly infections among children aged up to 14 reached 1,064 on 7 June - higher than the peak in early January, according to Public Health Scotland. While there is no evidence children are becoming seriously ill - with no significant rise in hospital admissions - growing numbers of pupils are off school. Provisional figures indicate 15,687 pupils were absent for Covid-related reasons at the end of last week, with overall attendance dropping to 87.8%. Data shows a four-fold increase in cases among children under 15, but infection rates are still considerably higher among young adults and older teenagers. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said Scotland will move quickly to vaccinate 12-15 year olds if recommended by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation. Read the full story.

hospital with coronavirus is on the rise again and reached 1,024 on Monday 7 June,
rising above 1,000 for the first time since mid-May. Back then, numbers were
falling and they reached a low point of just under 870 on 27 May. But they have risen by nearly
20% in the 11 days since then. This is still far below the
peak in Januaryâs wave when nearly 40,000 people were in hospital with
coronavirus in the UK. And people in the NHS say the cases theyâre seeing now are less serious than in previous waves. But they underline the inevitable
impact of the rising case numbers that we have been seeing in the UK. The rises in people in
hospital are driven by increasing numbers of people in hospital in Scotland and
the North West of England, the region and nation where cases have been rising
for the longest in the UK in the early stages of this third wave. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Traffic control measures have been imposed in parts of Guangzhou in an attempt to limit the spread of the virus In the past 24
hours, China has confirmed eight new domestic symptomatic cases of Covid-19,
all in southern Guangdong province. This is the
only area of mainland China where there is currently an outbreak; 164 people
are currently in hospital across the province. Most patients are in the
populous city of Guangzhou, which along with the nearby city of Foshan and
Wuchuan County, has local lockdowns in place. Guangzhou is
one of Chinaâs biggest cities, and as cases of mutant variants have been
detected, there have been some fears that it could see a large-scale outbreak,
like those seen in the cities ofWuhanorShijiazhuang. However, huge
vaccine uptake has helped China avoid a third wave â more than 800 million
vaccine doses have now been administeredacross the country,externaland recent media reports have suggested new patients have exhibited mild or no
symptoms. Even with
triple-digit cases, tens of thousands of students have still been able to sit
their university entrance exams in Guangzhou this week. This would have been
unthinkable during earlier outbreaks â Chinaâs approach to date has been to
swiftly lock down communities and order mass testing drives, allowing people
very little room for manoeuvre. But vaccination uptake has helped China relax
its Covid-19 regulations. Local governments have been increasingly finding safe
ways for events to go ahead, rather than simply cancelling them. It is still
not clear how this latest outbreak began. Health officials in Guangzhou say the genetic sequencing of cases in the city show a 98% similarity,
suggesting they are all linked to the same chain of transmission. A local
health commission official tells the official CCTV broadcasterâmore investigation is needed to identify patient zeroâ,external. Philippa RoxbyHealth reporter, BBC News There are still many unknowns about the Delta variant, first
detected in India, which is causing a worrying rise in cases and hospital
admissions in some areas of the UK. Overall, the virus is still at low levels â but there is now
clear concern from scientists that a third wave could be on its way. Prof Neil Ferguson, virus modeller from Imperial College
London, tells journalists the size and scale of that wave depends on how
effective the vaccines are at protecting against illness from the Delta
variant. That still isnât clear and more data needs to be collected. The Delta variant could be anywhere from 40-80% more
transmissible, he says, with 60% his âbest estimateâ. âBut thereâs still an enormous amount of uncertainty,â he
adds. In the meantime, administering as many second doses as
quickly as possible is a priority - to give people the best possible protection. As for easing final restrictions on 21 June, there is
caution from Prof Ferguson. Delaying unlocking, he says, would allow more people to be
vaccinated - and reduce the size of a third wave. But the final say rests with
the government.  Vaccines
should be prioritised for high-risk areas where there are a large number of cases
of the Delta variant, say a group of MPs and council leaders from north-west England. In a letter
to the prime minister, the group - which includes Blackburn MP Kate Hollern and
leader of Manchester City Council Sir Richard Leese - say the challenges
posed by the Delta variant are different to those faced by the country a few
months ago. Greater Manchester and Lancashire accounts for 90% of the areas with the highest infection rates in England, according to last week's data. The local leaders say with the vast majority of the most vulnerable fully vaccinated,
the âfocus should now shiftâ to areas where the likelihood of contracting the
Delta variant is greatest. The
letter calls on the government to ensure vaccines are making their way to
areas âthat need them mostâ, adding: âDoing so would not only benefit our local areas, but the national effort to contain
the spread of the Delta variant.â Around three million text messages are being sent out over this week to ask 25 to 29-year-olds to book their coronavirus vaccine through the national booking service. GPs are also set to urge the newly-eligible groups to come forward over the coming days. Text invitations, which do not expire, should appear as an alert from ""NHSvaccine"" and include a web link to the NHS website to reserve an appointment. When invited, people will be able to book at one of the 1,600 vaccination centres, pharmacies or GP sites across the country that are available through the national booking service. Vaccination centres are also popping up in places such as mosques, museums and sports stadiums. Who can book the vaccine now? Find out here. The UKâs latest
figures also show the number of people to have had one vaccine dose is now
40.7 million, while the number who have received both doses is 28.5 million. That's 77.3%
of the adult population who have had one jab, and 54.2% who have had two jabs. The UK
has recorded another 7,540 coronavirus cases,according to the latest government figures.,external That is
the highest number of daily cases reported since 26 February. The
seven-day average for cases is up by 66%, amid concerns the Delta variant is
fuelling a rise in infections. There
have also been a further six deaths within 28 days of a positive test. Today's figures compare with 4,330 cases a week ago and 12 deaths. We've got more now on the record day for vaccination bookings. When vaccine appointments opened to 25 to 29-year-olds yesterday the initial surge prompted 100,000 bookings an hour between 07:00 BST and midday, according to NHS figures. NHS chief executive Sir Simon Stevens labels it a ""Glastonbury-style"" rush for jabs - a reference to the traditional stampede to book tickets for the music festival. He says: ""The obvious enthusiasm of younger adults to get their jab has blown out of the water the suggestion that people in their 20s might not come forward to protect themselves and their loved ones."" Hitting one million bookings in a day ""sends a fantastic signal"", says Dr Emily Lawson, lead for the NHS Covid Vaccination Programme. She says it shows ""the Covid-19 vaccine is something that all of us - no matter our age â can value and be excited by and most importantly should get, when our opportunity comes."" Coronavirus vaccine bookings on the NHS website reached a record high of more than one million yesterday. It's first time daily appointments made through the national booking service have topped the million mark. As vaccines were opened up to people aged 25 to 29 yesterday morning, a total of 1,082,596 first and second dose slots were snapped up across the day online and by phone. That's about 45,000 an hour on average and more than 750 every minute, over the full 24 hours. The daily total for the National Booking Service yesterday means around four times as many slots were booked yesterday compared with the day before and the same day last week. Covid-19 testing in Northern Ireland's post-primary schools is to be extended to all pupils from this week until the end of the summer term. Previously, lateral flow device (LFD) testshad been made available to older students in years 12 to 14 onlywhere prevalence of Covid-19 tends to be higher. But for the final fortnight of term, the twice-weekly tests will be expanded to cover years eight to 11 - encompassing pupils aged 12 and upwards. NI Education Minister Peter Weir is urging schools ""to make use of their stock of LFD kits to extend the offer to all pupils in Years 8-11 for the remaining weeks of term"". ""The purpose of asymptomatic testing is to find individuals who are infected but do not realise it."" he explains. ""They can then be advised to isolate so reducing the risk of them unwittingly spreading infection in the school and elsewhere."" Read the full story. The chairs of two parliamentary select committees have written to Dominic Cummings asking him to provide documentary evidence for âseveral serious allegationsâ he made last month. In the letter, sent last week, Greg Clark and Jeremy Hunt asked for evidence for the claims Cummings made about Health Secretary Matt Hancockâs honesty. In addition, Cummings has been asked to provide text exchanges he had with the prime minister, as well as numerous ministers, officials and journalists. The pair had asked for the evidence to be provided by 4 June to allow it to be studied by their joint inquiry on coronavirus, ahead of Hancockâs appearance tomorrow. But âno evidence has been received to date from Dominic Cummingsâ by the Committee. While older people have been the most at risk from coronavirus itself, the young have disproportionately suffered from its economic fallout, according to unemployment figures. The unemployment rate among young people was 14.6% in 2020 but 5.2% for over 25s, according to the International Labour Organization (ILO). ""The young jobless have been stuck in a Covid-19 limbo-land,"" says Sher Verick, from ILO. ""This crisis has...not only led to the closure of businesses and job losses, but the lockdown measures have also severely constrained young people's ability to search for a job,"" he says.

Here's a round-up of the main headlines today: This video can not be played Free Hugs: Does Covid mean the end of hugging strangers? The Covid pandemic put a stop to the Free Hugs movement - with social distancing guidelines and restrictions in place in countries around the world. The group used to offer hugs to strangers every weekend - but they say any decision to relax social distancing should be treated with caution. BBC health reporter, Laura Foster, spoke to some members of Free Hugs UK about the importance of hugs and when they might be able to freely hug again. The Penta Hotel in Reading's Oxford Rd opened as a quarantine facility on 29 April A local council has called on the government to shut a quarantine hotel in Reading after a total of 44 positive cases of Covid-19 were identified among residents and staff. Reading Council says it is ""unconvinced"" the outbreak is under control or that robust safety measures are in place. The quarantine facility, run by the Department of Health and Social Care, opened on 29 April. Reading Borough Council says it was notified of the first Covid outbreak on 9 May. The local authority says cases have spread ""between guests, and hotel and security staff"". It says it believes at least three cases in the community have been directly linked to the hotel's outbreak and the spread ""could have been avoided had the correct safety procedures been in place"" at the outset. The majority of the positive cases have been identified as the Delta variant. The Department for Health and Social Care has been approached for comment. Prime Minister Boris Johnson says itâs
too early to say if England's lockdown can end on 21 June as data on whether
the vaccine rollout offers enough protection from the Delta variant is still being assessed. ""On Monday... we'll have a look
at where we are. I think what everybody can see very clearly is that cases are
going up, and in some places hospitalisations are going up,"" he says, speaking in Cornwall ahead of the G7 conference. ""What we need to assess is the
extent to which the vaccine rollout - which has been phenomenal - has built up
protection in the population in order for us to go ahead to the next stage. And
so that's what we'll be looking at."" As we reported earlier, the UK has recorded another 7,540 coronavirus cases over the past 24 hours - the highest number of daily cases reported since the end of February. Cases have risen dramatically over the past week, with a seven-day average of 5,984 - as the Delta variant continues to make its presence felt. But the number of cases is still far off the peak in January - and daily deaths remain low: on Wednesday, data showed a further six deaths within 28 days of a positive test - compared with 12 deaths a week ago. Scientists attribute the fall in both hospitalisations and deaths to the success of the vaccine rollout.

"UK adults spent an average of three hours and 47 minutes online every day during the pandemic, an annual survey of media habits by regulator Ofcom has found. That was over an hour longer than adults in Germany and France. In addition, online shopping sales in the UK rose by 48% to Â£113bn, with food and drink sales rising the most. Ofcom said the Online Nation 2021 report revealed how the pandemic had accelerated a shift to online. In a year when many had to find what entertainment they could at home, gaming saw a big increase with half who played telling Ofcom it helped them get through lockdown. Sixty-two per cent of adults, and 92% of 16 to 24 year-olds, said they played computer games. Communication at work and at play also changed as workplaces closed and travel was restricted. ""Zoom had extraordinary growth - from a few hundred thousand users in the first two months of 2020 to more than 13 million in April and May,"" the report said. The report found many people were glued to their phones. Mobile apps cost British people nearly Â£2.45bn with most going on Tinder, Disney+, YouTube and Netflix. TikTok grew rapidly, Ofcom said, from three million adult visitors in September 2019 to 14 million by March this year. Young adults aged 18-24 more than doubled the time they spent on the short-form video app each day, from 17 minutes to 38 minutes in September 2020. And, as the High Street was forced to close, online sales rose by almost half. Half of adults said that news and information was a big reason they went online - but they often encountered misinformation. Some 46% of UK adults who looked for information about the pandemic said they had found misleading or untrue information. Among the most commonly shared falsehoods in the first quarter of 2021 were that face masks offered no protection or caused harm, and that the number of deaths linked to coronavirus was much lower than reported. The report found that ""adults are as likely to use social media to find information about the Covid-19 pandemic as they are to use news sites and apps"" with Facebook the main source. However, only 16% who used Facebook for information about Covid-19 said they trusted it as a source. TikTok - popular in many countries of the world - also took off in the UK Around one in eight online adults and more than one in five of those aged 15-34 said they used an online dating service before the first lockdown. But the money lost to romance scams increased 12% to reach Â£18.5m. Nearly half (49%) of UK adults visited an adult website or app in September 2020. Ofcom found the largest site, Pornhub, was visited by around half of all UK online men, but just over one in six of online women. In December, the site removed millions of user-generated videos from view after the New York Times alleged it  was ""infested"" with illegal material, allegations its parent company Mindgeek denied. The report notes that while many benefited from access to the net, it meant that in Ofcom's words ""lockdown had a greater effect on people who are digitally excluded"". It noted nearly one in five over-64s and roughly one in 10 in lower socio-economic households did not have internet access, turning a digital divide into a social one. The digital divide also extended to schoolchildren. It found that nearly all children had access to the internet, but 4% had access only by mobile phone. One in five children lacked a device that would be suitable for doing school work on. While children spent more time online, the report found nearly half reported ""negative experiences"" . On mobile phones, 30% of these negative experiences were being contacted online by someone they didn't know who wanted to be their ""friend"".

"This video can not be played Kamala Harris to illegal migrants: 'Do not come' Vice-President Kamala Harris has faced pressure to visit the US-Mexico border, as she tries to tackle a record migration spike. Ms Harris had a testy exchange with a journalist who asked why she had not gone to the US southern boundary. Members of Ms Harris's own Democratic party meanwhile criticised her after she warned against illegal immigration. On a visit to Mexico on Tuesday, she said Washington aimed to boost economic development in the region. She and Mexican President AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador said it was in the interests of both countries to address the root causes of migration. About 178,000 undocumented migrants arrived at the US southern border this April, the highest total in more than two decades. The vice-president's staff initially said the border was part of Ms Harris's portfolio when US President Joe Biden assigned her in March to stem migration from Latin America. But aides have recently been seeking to distance her from the politically toxic crisis. While recent public polling,externalsuggests a generally favourable view of the Biden administration's policies on the economy and pandemic, its handling of the immigration crisis has proven less popular. Children tell of neglect, filth and fear in US camps Asked in an interview with NBC News aired on Tuesday morning whether she had any plans to visit the border, Ms Harris threw up her arms and responded: ""At some point. You know... we are going to the border. We have been to the border."" When the host pointed out that she had not herself visited the region, she said with a laugh: ""And I haven't been to Europe. I don't understand the point you're making."" Children detained at a holding facility for undocumented migrants in Donna, Texas, in March Ms Harris again brushed off questions about why she had not gone to the border as she spoke to reporters on Tuesday in Mexico. ""It would be very easy to say,"" she said, ""we'll travel to one place and therefore it's solved. I don't think anybody thinks that that would be the solution."" Pressed on why she would not visit the border, Ms Harris said she had done so when she was a senator for California. Ms Harris's remarks came at the end of a two-day visit to Guatemala and Mexico, where she met both countries' leaders in a bid to bolster diplomatic ties and help stem undocumented migration to the US. Capping off her trip on Tuesday, Ms Harris met President LÃ³pez Obrador privately for more than an hour, said the vice-president's aides. It is unclear whether she pushed Mexico's president to do more to detain migrants en route to the US. Mr LÃ³pez Obrador, a left-wing leader, has previously blamed the Biden administration for causing the record surge in undocumented migration. An aide to Ms Harris later said she had pledged $130m (Â£92m) in US aid to support Mexican workers' rights. She has already promised $310m to alleviate the impact of the pandemic and hurricanes last year in Central America. Back at the White House daily briefing on Tuesday, Biden spokeswoman Jen Psaki was asked why Ms Harris had not visited the US-Mexico boundary. ""I think that at some point she may go to the border,"" Ms Psaki said. ""We'll see."" For as much as she may be coming under pressure to visit the border back at home, it's what she said earlier on this trip which is causing dismay in Central America. Specifically her stark warning that would-be migrants ""do not come"" - three words she repeated for added emphasis. A wide array of activists, human rights lawyers and journalists have pointed out the inconsistency in such a message. First, they say, it fails to take into account the reality on the ground for so many millions of the poorest in Central America. Battered by hurricanes, hunger, natural disaster, climate change and coronavirus, the economic downturn in the region could last for many years. That's to mention nothing of the rampant gang violence and forced recruitment of vulnerable young people in the region. Added to that, her statement appeared to ignore the fact that requesting asylum is a legal right, one which Ms Harris had berated the Trump administration for undermining while she was a candidate. More than one observer has commented on how it was particularly jarring to hear it from the vice-president, as the daughter of immigrants herself. In Mexico, the focus shifted to broader bilateral issues: the economy, security co-operation, development plans for southern Mexico and Central America. Yet immigration remains the overriding concern for the Biden administration in this part of the world. For as much as both countries spoke at length of ""orderly, safe and regular migration flows"" or tackling the ""root causes of migration"", most people will remember Vice-President Harris's first international trip for those three short words: ""Do not come"". Critics across the political spectrum said Ms Harris's remarks in Guatemala on Monday contradicted the Biden administration's promise to usher in a more humane approach on migration. ""Do not come. Do not come,"" the vice-president warned illegal immigrants, adding: ""If you come to our border, you will be turned back."" While running for the presidency in 2019, Ms Harris lambasted then-President Donald Trump for turning away undocumented immigrants at the border. ""What does Donald Trump do?"" she said. ""He says, 'go back where you came from.' That is not reflective of our America and our values and it's got to end."" Harris tells Guatemala migrants: 'Do not come' What is Biden doing differently at US border? Ms Harris's remarks on Monday provided fodder for her regular Republican critics, but they also provoked rare rebukes from left-wing members of her own party. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the influential New York City Democratic congresswoman, called the remark ""disappointing"". ""First, seeking asylum at any US border is a 100% legal method of arrival,"" she tweeted. ""Second, the US spent decades contributing to regime change and destabilisation in Latin America. We can't help set someone's house on fire and then blame them for fleeing."" A man detained in Arizona wears a T-shirt saying ""please let us in"" Fellow members of her ultraliberal group known as the Squad also criticised Ms Harris, who is herself the daughter of migrants - an Indian-born mother and a Jamaican-born father. ""The right to seek asylum is not just legally protected. It is a foundational universal human right,"" tweeted Minnesota congresswoman Ilhan Omar, who was born in Somalia. Michigan's Rashida Tlaib also hit out at Ms Harris, writing: ""This whole 'stay there and die' approach is not how our country will promote a more humane and just immigration system."" Asked later about the criticism, Ms Harris said: ""I'm really clear. We have to deal with the root causes and that is my hope. Period."" What are Biden's challenges at the border?

"Harry has previously said of his grandmother: ""She's my colonel-in-chief, right? She always will be"" The Queen was not asked by the Duke and Duchess of Sussex about naming their daughter Lilibet, a Palace source has told the BBC. The source disputed reports in the wake of the announcement of the name that Prince Harry and Meghan had spoken to the Queen before the birth. But a Sussexes' spokesperson insisted they would not have used the name had the Queen not been supportive. They said the monarch was the first family member the duke had called. The spokesperson said: ""The duke spoke with his family in advance of the announcement - in fact his grandmother was the first family member he called. ""During that conversation, he shared their hope of naming their daughter Lilibet in her honour. Had she not been supportive, they would not have used the name."" In a letter to some news broadcasters and publishers, the law firm Schillings, which acts for Prince Harry and Meghan, said the BBC report that the Queen was not asked for permission to use the name Lilibet was false and defamatory and should not be repeated. Lilibet has been the Queen's nickname among family since her childhood. 12 claims from Meghan's Oprah interview Harry: I want to break cycle of pain for my family Royal Family tree and line of succession The relationship between the couple and the Royal Family has made headlines in recent months. Earlier this year, while the couple were expecting their daughter, they aired criticisms of the Royal Family and made an allegation of racism inan explosive interview with Oprah Winfrey. And although Harry spoke about difficulties between him and his father, he said that he had a ""really good"" relationship with the Queen and they spoke regularly over video call. At the weekend,the couple announcedthat Lilibet ""Lili"" Diana Mountbatten-Windsor had been born at a hospital in Santa Barbara in California on Friday morning. The name ""Lilibet"" is heavy with personal history for Her Majesty. The nickname was coined when then-Princess Elizabeth was just a toddler and couldn't pronounce her own name properly. Her grandfather King George V would affectionately call her Lilibet, imitating her  attempts to say her name. It stuck and came to be used by close relatives. She signed her name as Lilibet on the funeral wreath for one of her closest friends Earl Mountbatten. The Queen's late husband, the Duke of Edinburgh, also called her by the nickname. The Queen, pictured here with her grandparents in 1932, was called Lilibet by her grandfather King George V Following Lilibet's birth, it was widely presumed that Harry and Meghan had first spoken to the Queen about the choice of name. There were subsequent stories in the press quoting ""friends"" of the couple who strongly suggested that Harry had sought permission from his grandmother. The Times also reported,externalthat it understood the Queen had been informed by Harry about the name. And a source close to the Sussexes also told the BBC that Harry had spoken to the Queen before the birth and ""would have mentioned the name"" - claims a Palace source has since disputed. The couple's first son, Archie, was born in the UK before they moved across the Atlantic Lilibet is the Queen's 11th great-grandchild and younger sister to Archie, who is now two years old. Her middle name, Diana, is a tribute to Prince Harry's late mother. Princess Charlotte, the daughter of Prince William and Catherine, also has Diana as one of her middle names, as well as Elizabeth. After her birth, Buckingham Palace said the Queen and other senior royals had been informed and were ""delighted with the news"". During the interview with Oprah in March, the couple said they would be done after baby number two - meaning they were not planning to have any more children.

"This video can not be played Kamala Harris to illegal migrants: 'Do not come' Vice-President Kamala Harris has faced pressure to visit the US-Mexico border, as she tries to tackle a record migration spike. Ms Harris had a testy exchange with a journalist who asked why she had not gone to the US southern boundary. Members of Ms Harris's own Democratic party meanwhile criticised her after she warned against illegal immigration. On a visit to Mexico on Tuesday, she said Washington aimed to boost economic development in the region. She and Mexican President AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador said it was in the interests of both countries to address the root causes of migration. About 178,000 undocumented migrants arrived at the US southern border this April, the highest total in more than two decades. The vice-president's staff initially said the border was part of Ms Harris's portfolio when US President Joe Biden assigned her in March to stem migration from Latin America. But aides have recently been seeking to distance her from the politically toxic crisis. While recent public polling,externalsuggests a generally favourable view of the Biden administration's policies on the economy and pandemic, its handling of the immigration crisis has proven less popular.
