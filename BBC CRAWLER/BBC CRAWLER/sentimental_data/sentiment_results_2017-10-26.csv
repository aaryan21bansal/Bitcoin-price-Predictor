"This video can not be played What will top-secret JFK files tell us about Kennedy's killer? The US government has released 2,800 previously classified files on the assassination of President John F Kennedy in 1963. President Donald Trump said the public deserved to be ""fully informed"" about the event, which has been the subject of numerous conspiracy theories. But some documents have been withheld at the request of government agencies. One memo revealed thatthe FBI had warned police of a death threat,externalagainst the assassin Lee Harvey Oswald. ""We at once notified the chief of police and he assured us Oswald would be given sufficient protection"", writes the FBI director J Edgar Hoover. Oswald, a former Marine and self-proclaimed Marxist, was shot dead in the basement of the Dallas Police department two days after President Kennedy was killed. As the documents are pored over and analysed, other findings include a CIA memo that suggestsOswald spoke with a KGB officer,externalat the Russian embassy in Mexico City. The memo says the KGB officer Oswald spoke with worked for a department ""responsible for sabotage and assassination"". Another memo showed thatSoviet officials feared an ""irresponsible general"",externalwould launch a missile at the USSR in the wake of President Kennedy's death. One memo tells howa British regional newspaper, the Cambridge News, received an anonymous call about ""some big news"" in the US, minutes before the assassination. A copy of the memo was released by the National Archives in the US in July, but had gone unreported. The president and first lady in Dallas less than an hour before his assassination President Kennedy was shot dead on 22 November 1963 as he travelled through Dallas in an open-topped limousine. The Warren Commission's report into the shooting, published in September 1964, said that Lee Harvey Oswald had fired the fatal shots from the Texas School Book Depository building. JFK Files: The most interesting points There was ""no evidence that either Lee Harvey Oswald or Jack Ruby was part of any conspiracy, domestic or foreign"", the commission said. A 1992 law passed by Congress required all records related to the assassination - around five million pages - to be publicly disclosed in full within 25 years. The deadline was Thursday. More than 90% of the files were already in the public domain. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Allegations of a government cover-up are unlikely to be assuaged by reports that the CIA, FBI, Department of State and other agencies lobbied at the last minute to keep certain documents under wraps. In a memo directing heads of executive departments to release the files, Mr Trump said the American public deserves to be ""fully informed about all aspects of this pivotal event"". ""Therefore, I am ordering today that the veil finally be lifted,"" the president wrote. JFK assassination: Questions that won't go away JFK and the rise of conspiracy theories Some redacted documents are undergoing a further six-month review, but it is possible those records could stay secret after the deadline on 26 April next year. The president, according to White House officials, was reluctant to agree to agency requests to hold the remaining documents. ""I have no choice - today - but to accept those redactions rather than allow potentially irreversible harm to our Nation's security,"" Mr Trump added in his memo.

"Craig Forbes was jailed for eight years and Sarah Gotham was sentenced to nine years A couple who sexually assaulted a child and live streamed the abuse to an American paedophile via Skype have been jailed. Sarah Gotham, 34, and Craig Forbes, 36, drugged and then abused the girl between December 2012 and March 2013. They streamed the abuse to convicted sex offender Kori Ellis, 42, who was in California, Plymouth Crown Court heard. Gotham, of Plymouth, was jailed for nine years and Forbes, of Torquay, was sentenced to eight years in prison. More on this story and other Devon and Cornwall news Forbes had earlier admitted three charges of sexual assault, possession of indecent images and breaching a sexual harm prevention order. Gotham was found guilty of six charges of sexual assault of a child under 13 following a trial at Plymouth Crown Court. The court heard how the two had sex sessions with the girl present and that Gotham also performed sex acts on her. They broadcast it live via Skype to Ellis, a former magician's assistant and dominatrix, who they had met in a web chat room. The pair came to the attention of British police through the arrest of Ellis, who has since pleaded guilty in a trial in the US to the production of indecent images of children, the court heard. Ellis was flown to the UK accompanied by four FBI officers to give evidence against Gotham at her trial in person. She told the jury she watched Gotham abuse the girl alone and on other occasions with Forbes. Prosecutors said Gotham ""was more than a spectator or a passenger"" and played an active part in the abuse. Passing sentence, Judge Ian Lawrie said he believed Gotham had been ""corrupted"" by Forbes and had been ""under his spell"". He added of Forbes: ""He is manipulative, devious and is unquestionably interested in child pornography and from everything I have read and heard a clear and constant threat to children."" The judge told Forbes: ""You fell under the corrupting influence of Mr Forbes. But that does not excuse your responsibility for the offences."" Nicholas Lewin, defending Gotham, said the offences happened as a result of Forbes's influence and branded him the ""vilest of predatory paedophiles"".

"WannaCry was the biggest cyber-attack that has affected the NHS to date NHS trusts were left vulnerable in a majorransomwareattack in May because cyber-security recommendations were not followed, a government report has said. More than a third of trusts in England were disrupted by the WannaCry ransomware, according to the National Audit Office (NAO). At least 6,900 NHS appointments were cancelled as a result of the attack. NHS England said no patient data had been compromised or stolen and praised the staff response. The NAO chief said the Department of Health and the NHS must now ""get their act together"". Cyber-attack: Your questions answered WannaCry: What can you do to protect your business? Malware, patches and worms defined WannaCry, which spread to more than 150 countries in a worldwide ransomware outbreak beginning on 12 May, wasthe biggest cyber-attack to have hit the NHSto date. The malware encrypted data on infected computers and demanded a ransom roughly equivalent to Â£230 ($300). TheNAO report,externalsaid there was no evidence that any NHS organisation paid the ransom - but the financial cost of the incident remained unknown. An assessment of 88 out of 236 trusts by NHS Digital before the attack found that none passed the required cyber-security standards. As a result of disruption caused by WannaCry, patients were turned away from appointments The report said NHS trusts had not acted on critical alerts from NHS Digital and a warning from the Department of Health and the Cabinet Office in 2014 to patch or migrate away from vulnerable older software. The Department of Health also lacked important information, the report said. ""Before 12 May 2017, the department had no formal mechanism for assessing whether NHS organisations had complied with its advice and guidance."" Organisations could also have better managed their computers' firewalls - but in many cases they did not, it said. NHS organisations have not reported any cases of harm to patients or of their data being stolen as a result of WannaCry. NHS England has identified 6,912 appointments - including operations - that were cancelled as a direct result of the ransomware. But it estimated that about 19,000 appointments in total may have been affected. This video can not be played Technology explained: what is ransomware? Cases included at least 139 people potentially with cancer, who had urgent referrals cancelled. It is not known: how many GP appointments were cancelled how many ambulances and individuals were diverted from five accident and emergency departments unable to treat some patients how many trusts or GPs experienced delays in information, such as test results The NAO credits the widely reported work of cyber-security researcher Marcus Hutchins, who accidentally helped to stop the spread of WannaCry. His ""kill switch""involved registering a domain namelinked to the malware, which deactivated the program's ability to spread automatically. This video can not be played LISTEN: How 'Malware Tech' became an 'accidental hero' Home Office Minister Ben Wallace told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the government was ""as sure as possible"" that North Korea was behind the attack. ""This attack, we believe quite strongly that it came from a foreign state,"" he said. ""It is widely believed in the community and across a number of countries that North Korea [took on] this role"". Speaking on the same programme, former chairman of NHS Digital, Kingsley Manning, said that a failure to upgrade old computer systems at a local level within the NHS had contributed to the rapid spread of the malware. He said: ""The problem with cyber security for the NHS is [that] it has a particular vulnerability... It's very interconnected so if you get an attack in one place it tends to spread."" Mr Manning blamed a lack of time and resources but also ""frankly a lack of focus, a lack of taking it seriously"" for individual NHS organisations' failure to keep up with cyber-security improvements. ""This was an extremely unsophisticated attack,"" he added. The NAO said the NHS ""has accepted that there are lessons to learn"" from WannaCry and will now develop a response plan. It will also ensure that critical cyber-security updates - such as applying software patches - are carried out by IT staff, the NAO said. WannaCry was ""a relatively unsophisticated attack and could have been prevented by the NHS following basic IT security best practice,"" said Sir Amyas Morse, comptroller and auditor-general of the NAO. ""There are more sophisticated cyber-threats out there than WannaCry so the Department and the NHS need to get their act together to ensure the NHS is better protected against future attacks."" Keith McNeil, NHS chief clinical information officer for health and care, said: ""As the NAO report makes clear, no harm was caused to patients and there were no incidents of patient data being compromised or stolen. ""Tried and tested emergency plans were activated quickly and our hard-working NHS staff went the extra mile to provide patient care, keeping the impact on NHS services and patients to a minimum."" For many executives, a serious cyber-attack is now very high on their list of risks to their organisations and a priority for disaster planning. So what is most shocking in this report is the lack of planning at a local level in the NHS for such an event. To be fair, the Department of Health had developed a plan - it was just that it had not been properly communicated or tested in the NHS trusts. When disaster struck, nobody seemed to know who was in charge or what to do. Of course, all of this could have been avoided if security patches had been applied to protect the Windows 7 systems common throughout the NHS. Once again, there had been warnings sent out by NHS Digital, but many trusts failed to act upon them - though in that they were no different from many organisations around the world that were also hit. In one way, the NHS was lucky - if, instead of a Friday in May, the attack had taken place on a Monday in winter, with a week's appointments affected, the damage would have been far worse. Cyber-security experts will tell you that dealing with attacks like these is mostly a management rather than a technology problem. And in this case the NHS proved itself incapable of managing a speedy and effective response to its first major cyber-security crisis.

"For nearly two decades Sweden has been battling a mysterious illness. Called Resignation Syndrome, it affects only the children of asylum-seekers, who withdraw completely, ceasing to walk or talk, or open their eyes. Eventually they recover. But why does this only seem to occur in Sweden? When her father picks her up from her wheelchair, nine-year-old Sophie is lifeless.  In contrast, her hair is thick and shiny - like a healthy child's.  But Sophie's eyes are closed.  And under her tracksuit bottoms she wears a nappy.  A transparent feeding tube runs into Sophie's nose - this is how she has been nourished for the past 20 months. Sophie and her family are asylum seekers from the former USSR.  They arrived in December 2015 and live in accommodation allocated to refugees in a small town in central Sweden. ""Her blood pressure is quite normal,"" says Dr Elisabeth Hultcrantz, a volunteer with Doctors of the World.  ""But she has a high pulse rate, so maybe she's reacting to so many people coming to visit her today."" Hultcrantz tests Sophie's reflexes.  Everything works normally. But the child does not stir. An ENT surgeon before she retired, Hultcrantz is worried because Sophie does not ever open her mouth.  This could be dangerous, because if there were a problem with her feeding tube, Sophie could choke. Elisabeth Hultcrantz: Children disconnect the conscious part of their brain So how could a child who loved to dance become so deeply inert? ""When I explain to the parents what has happened, I tell them the world has been so terrible that Sophie has gone into herself and disconnected the conscious part of her brain,"" says Hultcrantz. The health professionals who treat these children agree that trauma is what has caused them to withdraw from the world.  The children who are most vulnerable are those who have witnessed extreme violence - often against their parents - or whose families have fled a deeply insecure environment. Sophie's parents have a terrifying story of extortion and persecution by a local mafia.  In September 2015 their car was stopped by men in police uniform. ""We were dragged out. Sophie was in the car so she witnessed me and her mother being roughly beaten,"" remembers Sophie's father. The men let Sophie's mother go - she grabbed her daughter and ran.  But Sophie's father did not escape. ""They took me away and then I don't remember anything,"" he says. Sophie's mother took her to a friend's home. The little girl was very upset. She cried, shouted ""Please go and find my dad!"", and beat the wall with her feet. Three days later, her father made contact, and from then on the family remained on the move, hiding in friends' homes until they left for Sweden three months later.  On arrival, they were held for hours by Swedish police.  Then, quite quickly, Sophie deteriorated. ""After a couple of days, I noticed she wasn't playing as much as she used to with her sister,"" says Sophie's mother, who is expecting a new baby next month. Soon afterwards, the family was informed they could not stay in Sweden.  Sophie heard everything in that meeting with the Migration Board, and it was at this point that she stopped speaking and eating. Resignation Syndrome was first reported in Sweden in the late 1990s.  More than 400 cases were reported in the two years from 2003-2005. As more Swedes began to worry about the consequences of immigration, these ""apathetic children"", as they were known, became a huge political issue. There were reports the children were faking it, and that parents were poisoning their offspring to secure residence. None of those stories were proven. Over the last decade, the number of children reported to be suffering from Resignation Syndrome has decreased.  Sweden's National Board of Health recently stated there were 169 cases in 2015 and 2016. It remains the case that children from particular geographical and ethnic groups are the most vulnerable:  those from the former USSR, the Balkans, Roma children, and most recently the Yazidi.  Only a tiny number have been unaccompanied migrants, none have been African, and very few have been Asian.  Unlike Sophie, the children affected have often been living in Sweden for years, speak the language and are well-adjusted to their new, Nordic lives. Numerous conditions resembling Resignation Syndrome have been reported before - among Nazi concentration camp inmates, for example.  In the UK, a similar condition - Pervasive Refusal Syndrome - was identified in children in the early 1990s, but there have been only a tiny handful of cases, and none of them among asylum seekers. ""To our knowledge, no cases have been established outside of Sweden,"" writes Dr Karl Sallin, a paediatrician at the Astrid Lindgren Children's Hospital, part of Karolinska University Hospital in Stockholm. Sophie's mother, sister and father Listen toSweden's Child Migrant Mysteryon Assignment, on the BBC World Service For transmission times or to catch up online,click here So how can an illness respect national boundaries?  There is no definitive answer to that question, says Sallin, who is researching Resignation Syndrome for his PhD. ""The most plausible explanation is that there are some sort of socio-cultural factors that are necessary in order for this condition to develop.  A certain way of reacting or responding to traumatic events seems to be legitimised in a certain context."" So somehow - and we do not know the mechanism for this, and why it should happen in Sweden - the kind of symptoms displayed by the children are culturally sanctioned: this is a way the children are allowed to express their trauma.   If that is the case, it raises an interesting question: could Resignation Syndrome be contagious? ""That is sort of implicit in the model. That if you provide the right sort of nourishment for those kinds of behaviours in a society, you will also see more cases,"" says Sallin. ""If you look at the very first case in 1998 in the north of Sweden, as soon as that case was reported, there were other cases emerging in the same area. And there have also been cases of siblings where first one develops it and then the other. But it should be noted that researchers who proposed that model of disease, they are not certain that there needs to be direct contact between cases.  It's a topic for research."" Here Sallin hits on the main obstacle to understanding Resignation Syndrome - the lack of research into it.  No-one has done follow-up on what happens to these children, but we do know that they survive. For Sophie's parents, that is hard to believe. They have seen no change in their daughter in 20 months.  Their days are punctuated by Sophie's regime - exercises to stop her muscles wasting, attempts to engage her with music and cartoons, walks outside in a wheelchair, feeding and changing. ""You need to harden your heart with these cases,"" says Sophie's paediatrician, Dr Lars Dagson, who has seen her regularly throughout her illness. ""I can only keep her alive.  I can't make her better, because as doctors we don't decide if these children can stay in Sweden or not."" Annica Carlshamre: This sickness has to do with trauma, not asylum Dagson shares the view commonly held among doctors treating children with Resignation Syndrome, that recovery depends on them feeling secure and that it is a permanent residence permit that kick-starts that process. ""In some way the child will have to sense that there's hope, something to live forâ¦  That's the only way I can explain why having the right to stay would, in all the cases I've seen so far, change the situation."" Until recently, families with a sick child were allowed to stay.  But the arrival of some 300,000 migrants in the last three years has led to a change of heart. Last year, a new temporary law came into force that limits all asylum seekers' chances of being granted permanent residence.  Applicants are granted either a three-year or 13-month visa. Sophie's family have the latter, and it expires in March next year. ""What happens afterwards?  The real issue hasn't been dealt with - it's limbo,"" says Dagson. He doubts Sophie will recover in 13 months. ""I can't say it's not possible, but it all depends how the parents sense this - are we going to stay after these 13 months?  If they're not sure about that, they cannot give Sophie the sense that everything is OK."" But evidence from the town of Skara in the south of Sweden suggests that there is a way of curing children with Resignation Syndrome even if the family doesn't receive permanent residence. ""From our point of view, this particular sickness has to do with former trauma, not asylum,"" says Annica Carlshamre, a senior social worker for Gryning Health, a company that runs Solsidan, a home for all kinds of troubled children. When children witness violence or threats against a parent, their most significant connection in the world is ripped apart, the carers at Solsidan believe. ""Then the child understands - my mother can't take care of me,"" Carlshamre explains. ""And they give up hope, because they know they are totally dependent on the parent.  When that happens, to where or what can the child turn?"" That family connection must be re-built, but first the child must begin to recover, so Solsidan's first step is to separate the children from their parents. ""We keep the family informed about their progress, but we don't let them talk because the child must depend on our staff.  Once we have separated the child, it takes only a few days, until we see the first signs that, yes, she's still thereâ¦"" All conversations about the migration process are banned in front of the child. The children get up every day. They have day clothes and night clothes, and experienced staff like Clara Ogren, help them colour or draw by holding their hands to grip a pencil. ""We play for them until they can play on their own.  And we goof around a lot and dance and listen to music.  We want to bring all their senses to life.  So we might take a little bit of Coca Cola, and put it in their mouth so they taste something sweet.  Even if they are tube-fed, we put them in the kitchen so they smell food,"" she says. ""We have an expectation that they want to live, and all their abilities are still there, but they just forgot or lost the sense of using them.  This work takes a lot of energy because we have to live for the children until they start to live on their own."" The longest time it took for a child to recover was six months. Often the children will have no contact with their parents until they are able to talk to them on the phone. Of the 35 children Calshamre has met over the years, one of them got permission to stay in Sweden while still at Solsidan.  The others recovered before their asylum status was assured. A book - The Way Back - has recently been published about Solsidan, but its work is not well-known.  Could this kind of treatment help Sophie?  Twenty months is a very long time for a child of her age to be disengaged from the world.  What do her parents think will aid her recovery? ""Maybe the new baby when it comes will help,"" says Sophie's father. Sophie's mother can only repeat what she has heard from the doctor. ""In order for Sophie to wake up, the doctor says she and her family should feel safe."" Their biggest fear is that they will be deported back to where they came from, and that the men who drove them out will find them. ""They promised they will kill us.  There is nothing more devastating that can happen.""

"Del Boy would be proud of this 'lovely jubbly' replica which was sold for Â£6,000 A life-sized Willy Wonka, a Terminator, and a gremlin - all previously owned by a drug dealer in England - were sold at auction in County Antrim on Thursday. Thousands of pounds worth of silver screen collectables were seized by police in Wiltshire. It followed a raid on a nuclear bunker which housed a giant cannabis farm. Martin Fillery, from Bridgwater, was jailed for eight years in August for conspiracy to produce class-B drugs. Some of the notable sales included: Back to the Future 2 Screen Used BMW - Â£20,000 Batboat - Â£15,000 Starsky and Hutch Ford replica - Â£7,500 Only Fools and Horses Replica Van - Â£6,000 Terminator 2 Statue - Â£3,100 Mini-Me Statue - Â£1,200 You could've had this four-seater replica Batboat for a splash at Â£15,000 Fillery had turned a nuclear bunker in Wiltshire into a drugs factory capable of producing Â£2m worth of cannabis a year, police said. The 46-year-old was also a film fan and a keen collector of ""boy's toys"", including a Star Wars stormtrooper, Batman's speedboat, and the car driven by Biff in the film Back to the Future. But when Fillery pleaded guilty to money laundering, his assets became subject to the proceeds of crime legislation. That means they were seized and then sold at a Wilsons Auctions in Mallusk. The firm holds government auctions every month. Or if you have a spare Â£13,000 perhaps a Batbike is more your thing? Feel those G-forces for Â£11,000! More than 150 items were up for auction, from a six-foot Iron Man which went for a solid Â£3,100 and a range of arcade games including Pac Man to a replica of Roland the Rat's car. Auctioneer Aidan Larkin said the lots, including a Mini-Me from the Austin Powers films, have attracted worldwide interest. These statues found new homes tonight. Ironman set his owner back Â£3,100, and the Terminator went for Â£5,750. ""There's an element of the man cave but there are also a lot of serious movie props and collectors will want them as an investment. ""There's a lot of Star Wars props, and there's life-size Stormtrooper outfit officially licensed by the company that provided them for the movie. ""They all have the certificates and documents."" Alongside the ET and Ewok figures, the lot featured a number of cars - including one that has starred on the big screen. 'Zebra three, zebra three' - a Starsky and Hutch replica car went for Â£7,500 ""We've got the most interest so far in the Back to the Future car,"" said Mr Larkin It was used by Biff in the film, and he famously had hover-boards attached to the back of it. It last changed hands for $25,000."" It was sold for Â£20,000. The Ratmobile, one for the 80s kids But for some, the collectibles are just that - items for film buffs to keep in their house as a memento of their favourite film. Mr Larkin said they received a lot of interest from hotels, bars and restaurants, but the ""sharp end"" of the bidding is normally from the global clientele. ""All of the money we raise goes back into the court and the public purse as part of the wider proceeds of crime case,"" he said.

"Victoria Cilliers described the moment she tried to untangle the parachute The wife of an Army sergeant accused of trying to kill her told a court ""everything went black"" as she struggled with her failing parachute. Victoria Cilliers, 40, suffered multiple injuries in a 4,000ft near-fatal fall at Netheravon Airfield, Wiltshire, in April 2015. Emile Cilliers, 37, denies two counts of attempted murder. His former army officer wife told Winchester Crown Court she was forced to cut away the main parachute. ""Straight away I knew something was not quite right, it had a lot of twists and the canopy wasn't floating,"" she said. ""I can't remember if I pulled the reserve or it deployed automatically.... it was very twisted."" Emile Cilliers denies attempting to murder his wife in April 2015 Prosecutors allege Mr Cilliers, based with the Aldershot-based Royal Army Physical Training Corps, twisted the lines of his wife's main parachute and sabotaged a reserve chute the day before her jump. In her second day of giving evidence, Mrs Cilliers told the jury how she tried to untangle the reserve parachute. ""I'm trying to fly something that is spinning quite fast, it's like a centrifuge, you end up facing the ground spinning quite rapidly. ""I had to use quite a lot of force using the whole body to untangle the twists which I managed. ""Then I couldn't work out why I couldn't get control, it was getting worse."" Physiotherapist Mrs Cilliers said the chances of a main parachute failing was one in 750 jumps but for the reserve to fail as well was ""one-in-a-million"". She suffered broken vertebrae, ribs and pelvis in the fall. ""The last thing I remember is trying to get some kind of control over it, trying to open as many cells as I could then everything went black,"" she said. ""I do not know if it was the G force or the impact but everything cut out."" Mr Cilliers denies two counts of attempted murder and one of criminal damage recklessly endangering life. The case continues. Watching a police video played in court, you would not have known that the woman sitting upright on the blue sofa giving a statement had recently fallen 4,000 feet in a near-fatal parachute jump. While one of her crutches was just about visible on screen, and a police officer mentioned a brace Mrs Cilliers was wearing, the injuries to her pelvis, spine, ribs and some internal organs were not obvious. Speaking calmly throughout, Mrs Cilliers answered questions for approximately 90 minutes. It wasn't until the end of the interview that emotions started to show. She said ""at no point"" did she ""ever suspect"" her husband. Parachute case accused 'despised by wife' Parachute trial accused 'caused gas leak' Parachute sabotage accused 'texted lover' Parachute 'sabotage' possible in minutes Accused husband 'skilled parachute packer' Reserve parachute 'had never failed' Parachute 'not tampered with in toilet' Parachute sabotage trial jury visits site Parachute murder bid accused 'unemotional' Jury shown 'tangled parachute' pictures Parachute fail wife 'among UK's best' HM Courts & Tribunals Service Man sought by police after convenience store incident Fire breaks out at secondary school Secondary school confirms it will be closed after fire Photographs show snow fall in New Forest amid yellow weather warning The Cotswolds named as one of best places to live in country New chairman takes on role at charity after day out with Bobby Van At least two killed and 1,000 structures destroyed as wildfires rage in Los Angeles In maps: Thousands of acres on fire in LA 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Why does Trump want Greenland and what do its people think?

"A couple whose bodies were held in a mortuary for 15 years after being discovered in a freezer in a former fishmonger's shop have been buried. Eugenios and Hilda Marcel were embalmed after they died in Edinburgh in the late 80s and early 90s. Their son Melvyn Marcel had opposed their burial and wanted to build a private mausoleum for his parents in the grounds of his property. However, Edinburgh Council won a legal battle to arrange their funeral. The couple were buried during a ceremony at Craigmillar Castle Park Cemetery on Thursday morning in front of a handful of people. Hilda Marcel died in 1987 from lung failure, and her husband Eugenios died in 1994 from cancer. Melvyn Marcel took legal action in an attempt to prevent the burial The couple's bodies were discovered in the basement of a former fishmonger's shop in the city's Gilmore Place in 2002, during an investigation into alleged fraud at a funeral home in West Lothian. It was claimed that staff at the Broxburn undertakers had been paid to preserve the remains. Four employees were sacked, although none of those alleged to have been involved in the fraud were charged or prosecuted for any offence. Following the discovery, Mr and Mrs Marcel's remains were taken to the city's Cowgate mortuary. Their son Melvyn said he wanted to build a fridge at his Edinburgh home, then build a private mausoleum in the grounds of his property. He eventually planned to take his parents' bodies to be buried in the West Bank. In February, a judgeruled that Edinburgh City Council had the legal authority to bury their bodies. Mr Marcel appealed against that decision, but it was upheld by appeal court judges.

"Tech giants Amazon and Google's parent Alphabet have posted a surge in sales over the last three months. Shares in Alphabet jumped above $1,000 in after-hours trading after the company reported sales up 24% to $27.8bn. Amazon, the world's biggest e-commerce site, saw sales rise 34% to $43.7bn - nearly the size of Slovenia's economy last year. Meanwhile, Microsoft's profit beat estimates on gains from cloud services. Alphabet's profits for the three months to 30 September rose to $7.8bn, from $5.6bn for the same quarter last year. Analysis: Tech results bring sweet Valley highs The company's chief financial officer, Ruth Porat, said the firm was delighted with the way it was performing. ""We had a terrific quarter, with revenues up 24% year on year, reflecting strength across Google and Other Bets,"" she said. ""Our momentum is a result of investments over many years in fantastic people, products and partnerships."" Google continues to make up the vast majority of Alphabet's revenue and income. However the so-called Other Bets unit, which includes the Waymo driverless car business and the Project Loon WiFi-enabled weather balloon venture, saw revenue increase and losses fall. Total Other Bets revenue was up to $302m, from $197m last year. YouTube continued to see ""phenomenal growth"", said Google chief executive Sundar Pichai in a conference call, with more than 1.5 billion people spending an average of an hour a day watching videos there on mobile devices, and surging use on television screens in homes. Despite Amazon's sales growth, the firm's profits were nearly flat as it ploughed money into tech gadgets, streaming video, data centres and warehouses to support its growing empire. The firm said profits in the three months to the end of September were $256m, up from $252m in 2016. Shares surged in after-hours trade anyway, as investors, who had been expecting a smaller number after being warned to expect the reinvestment, cheered the firm's growth prospects. Chief executive Jeff Bezos said the Amazon sales increase was in part down to the growing demand for the firm's smart home products, which are powered by artificially intelligent assistant, Alexa. ""In the last month alone, we've launched five new Alexa-enabled devices, introduced Alexa in India, announced integration with BMW, surpassed 25,000 skills, integrated Alexa with Sonos speakers, taught Alexa to distinguish between two voices, and more,"" Mr Bezos said. Upmarket grocer Whole Foods, which Amazon acquired in August, brought in $1.3bn in sales in the quarter. Excluding Whole Foods, sales increased 29%, Amazon said. Sales were up 35% overall in North America, which accounts for the bulk of Amazon's business. They increased 29% in its international division thanks in part to a Prime Day surge, but the unit is still running at an operating loss. The firm also said it now has nearly 542,000 full and part-time staff, including workers from Whole Foods. It continues to look at ways to expand its physical stores as well. Microsoft said it earned revenue of $24.5bn in the three months to end-September, up 12% year-on-year. The firm's profits were $6.6bn, rising 16%. Microsoft shares rose 3.1% after-hours to a record $81.2. Microsoft said growth was driven in part by its cloud computing products, which it has focused on in a bid to be less reliant on computer sales and older software. Amy Hood, executive vice-president and chief financial officer at Microsoft, called it a ""strong start"" to the year. The firm reported $6.9bn in revenue from its intelligent cloud unit, up 14% year-on-year. Its productivity and business processes division, which includes sales from Office 365, reported $8.2bn in revenue, up 28%. A fourth tech company, Intel, also posted a jump in revenues and profit. The world's largest computer chip maker said revenue rose 2% during the quarter to $16.1bn, with net income up 34% to $4.52bn.

"The 1851 oil painting by Sir Edwin Landseer features a red deer stag The National Galleries of Scotland (NGS) has disputed claims that the iconic Monarch of the Glen stag was painted at a Buckinghamshire hotel. The 1851 painting by Sir Edwin Landseerwas saved for the nation after a campaign to raise Â£4m in March. However, Stoke Park resort, which was once a stately home, said the artist often painted pictures of local deer there, including the Monarch stag. NGS said there was ""no doubt"" the painting was of a Highland setting. The oil painting, which is on tour around Scotland and is currently on show in Inverness, features a red deer stag at an unidentified location. It has been used by advertisers to sell soap and whisky and has become synonymous with a Victorian vision of Scotland. Despite that, the National Galleries of Scotland acknowledged that the Monarch of the Glen was most likely painted at Sir Edwin's studio in St John's Wood in London, where he owned a menagerie of animals that included deer. However, a spokesman said the artist had visited Scotland numerous times to paint the country's wildlife and scenery. It follows claims on the Stoke Park resort website that Sir Edwin often stayed at the Buckinghamshire property and created the iconic Scottish image while he was there. Nick Downie from Stoke Park told the BBC: ""It is our understanding that Sir Edwin Landseer painted many deer paintings at Stoke Park, including Monarch of the Glen. ""At the time Stoke Park had one of the UK's most famous deer parks."" The fundraising campaign at the National Galleries of Scotland launched with a light show A spokesman for the National Galleries of Scotland said: ""Though we can't be sure of the precise location, nobody is in any doubt that it depicts a Highland setting. ""Landseer was indeed an English painter, but from 1824 he made annual trips to the Highlands and painted the magnificent wildlife and landscapes of the region. ""The resulting paintings range from intimate and remarkably fresh studies painted on the spot, to his most famous large-scale picture, The Monarch of the Glen. ""Landseer suggested its identity when he first exhibited the painting, by including in the accompanying catalogue lines from an anonymous poem called Legends of Glenorchay, which describes a stag named 'The Monarch the Glen' surveying the landscape around his 'lair' in the 'wild Glen-Strae'."" When NGS began their fundraising campaign to buy the painting from drinks giant Diageo they received donations from as far afield as Los Angeles and Hong Kong. Public donations totalled more than Â£260,000, with the biggest donor the Heritage Lottery Fund, who gave Â£2.65m. The work, which measures 163.8cm x 169cm, is currently on tour and will be on public display in Inverness, Perth, Paisley and Kirkcudbright.

"Police said the charge against Mr Lythgoe was related to Labour MP Rosie Cooper A man arrested as part of an investigation into the far-right group, National Action, has been charged with encouragement to commit murder. The BBC understands the charge against Christopher Lythgoe, 31, from Cheshire, relates to Labour MP Rosie Cooper. He is one of six men charged with being members of the banned group. A 22-year-old man, from Lancashire, who cannot be named, has also been charged with the intention of committing acts of terrorism and ""threats to kill"". All six are to appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court on Friday. National Action became the first far-right organisation to be banned in the UK in December 2016. It means that being a member of or inviting support for the organisation is a criminal offence carrying a sentence of up to 10 years' imprisonment. Ms Cooper said: ""I would like to thank everyone involved in this case, especially the counter-terrorism police, for keeping me, my staff and the public safe. ""There remains an ongoing criminal investigation so it would not be appropriate for me to comment further."" By Dominic Casciani, BBC home affairs correspondent National Action became the first British neo-Nazi group to be banned last December after Home Secretary Amber Rudd said it was promoting violence and acts of terrorism. Members and supporters applauded the murder of Jo Cox MP by a white supremacist - and the group had carried out a series of small, but confrontational, demonstrations in towns and cities throughout England. One of its most notorious events saw masked members - many of them very young men - gathering outside York Minster to make Hitler salutes. Since it was banned, detectives have been carrying out more and more investigations into the group which, to all intents and purposes, has organised itself in a similar way to the banned al Muhajiroun network - the extremist Islamist youth movement. Both have used social media to target young people, attracting them with a simplistic us-and-them message designed to make them angry. The charges follow a number of raids across England and Wales by counter-terrorism officers as part of a national investigation into the group. The others charged with belonging to a proscribed organisation are: Garron Helm, 24, of Seaforth, Merseyside Matthew Hankinson, 23, of Newton-le-Willows, Merseyside Andrew Clarke, 33, of Warrington Michael Trubini, 35, of Warrington A spokeswoman for Greater Manchester Police said the men were charged following ""co-ordinated activity"" by police.

"This video can not be played Students with Catalan flags chanted ""independence"" Backers and opponents of independence in Catalonia have clashed in parliament over the way forward as the Spanish government is set to reassert control. The debate began after Catalan President Carles Puigdemont did not reveal a favoured course of action, and called on MPs to decide on a response. On Friday Spain's Senate is expected to curtail the region's autonomous powers. The move follows Catalonia's independence referendum, which Spain's Constitutional Court declared illegal. Mr Puigdemont declared independence after the 1 October vote. But he immediately suspended implementation, calling for talks. The Catalan government said that of the 43% who took part in the referendum, 90% were in favour of independence. Carles Puigdemont (right) has been under pressure not to call a snap election Many people gathered in Barcelona on Thursday hoping Mr Puigdemont would declare independence. But there has also been speculation that he might call regional elections in an effort to avoid rule from Madrid. However Mr Puigdemont did neither. ""I have been prepared to call elections, as long as guarantees are given,"" he said. He added that Spain's governing Popular Party had not given such assurances - without giving any details.

This video can not be played A Catalan government representative and a Spanish government minister fail to see eye to eye in a BBC interview But  Ines Arrimadas, leader of the anti-independence Citizens's party, accused Mr Puigdemont of missing countless opportunities to resolve the crisis through negotiation. ""You still have time to return to legality and call elections,"" she said. Analysis by James Reynolds, BBC News, Barcelona Spain's profound constitutional crisis in four decades of democracy is currently working its way through two competing parliaments. The country's Senate in Madrid is getting ready to approve emergency powers for the central government. Pro-independence members of the Catalan regional parliament believe that they must do something to counter any moves made in Madrid. Some parliamentarians want to go ahead and make an unequivocal unilateral declaration of Catalan independence. Pro-independence campaign groups have called for demonstrations outside the parliament building in the morning. Reacting to Mr Puigdemont's statement on Thursday, Spanish Deputy Prime Minister Soraya Saenz de Santamaria defended her government's handling of the crisis. She said the Spanish model was ""one of the most decentralised in the world"". She added: ""We've always shown our sincere desire to collaborate. The pro-independence camp have made it clear they don't want dialogue."" The parliamentary session in Barcelona is now suspended, and will resume on Friday morning. It is expected to vote on whether to declare unilateral independence or not. Also on Friday the Senate is due to hold a vote on the government's plan to trigger Article 155 of the Spanish constitution. Under the proposals announced by Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy this week, Mr Puigdemont would be removed and new regional elections held. Madrid would take control of Catalonia's finances, police and public media. Mr Rajoy's centre-right government has a majority in the Senate. The plan has also been approved by opposition parties.

"This video can not be played Abo Rabeea says he is still suffering from the suspected chemical weapons strike in Khan Sheikhoun Syria's government was responsible for a deadly chemical attack on a rebel-held town in the north-west of the country on 4 April, a UN report says. The authors say they are ""confident"" Damascus used sarin nerve agent in Khan Sheikhoun, killing more than 80 people. ""Today's report confirms what we have long known to be true,"" said the US ambassador to the UN, Nikki Haley. However, Syria's foreign ministry said on Friday it ""categorically denies"" the report's conclusions. ""This report and the one that preceded it are falsifications of the truth and distort the exact information on what happened at Khan Sheikhun,"" the statement said. The ministry went on to accuse the report of being a tool with which the UN could ""exert more political pressures"", according to news agency AFP. Syria chemical 'attack': What we know Syria 'still producing chemical weapons' Why is there a war in Syria? Syria's opposition and Western powers have blamed the incident on a government air strike on the area, but Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and his ally Russia have repeatedly said the incident was fabricated. Damascus and Moscow say an air strike hit a rebel depot full of chemical munitions. The Khan Sheikhoun attackprompted the US to use cruise missiles against a nearby Syrian airbase. The report findings were issued by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) and the UN's Joint Investigative Mechanism (JIM). ""The panel is confident that the Syrian Arab Republic is responsible for the release of sarin at Khan Sheikhoun on 4 April 2017,"" stated the report. This video can not be played Rescue workers said many children were among those killed or injured in the attack Meanwhile, Ms Haley said in a statement: â""Time and again, we see independent confirmation of chemical weapons use by the Assad regime. And in spite of these independent reports, we still see some countries trying to protect the regime. That must end now."" UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said: ""Britain condemns this appalling breach of the rules of war and calls on the international community to unite to hold Assad's regime accountable."" Aftermath of attack in pictures(Warning: graphic images) The UN director at Human Rights Watch, Louis Charbonneau, said that ""today's report should lay to rest any discussion about who was responsible for the Khan Sheikhoun attack"". He added: ""The question now is whether Security Council and OPCW members, including Russia, will move to protect a key international rule and hold Syrian authorities accountable as they said they would."" Speaking to the Interfax news agency, Russia's Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said the UN report had ""many inconsistencies"". He said: ""Even the first cursory read shows many inconsistencies, logical discrepancies, using doubtful witness accounts and unverified evidence."" On Tuesday,Russia vetoed a resolution extending the JIM's mandate- the only official mission investigating the use of chemical weapons in Syria. The report also said that so-called Islamic State (IS) was responsible for using sulphur mustard in an attack that in Um-Housh, Syria, on 16 September 2016. Witnesses and activists say warplanes attacked Khan Sheikhoun, about 50km (30 miles) south of the city of Idlib, early on 4 April, when many people were asleep. Mariam Abu Khalil, a 14-year-old resident who was awake,told the New York Times,externalthat she had seen an aircraft drop a bomb on a one-storey building. The explosion sent a yellow mushroom cloud into the air that stung her eyes. ""It was like a winter fog,"" she said. She sheltered in her home, but recalled that when people started arriving to help the wounded, ""they inhaled the gas and died"". Hussein Kayal, a photographer for the pro-opposition Edlib Media Center (EMC), was reported as saying that he was awoken by the sound of an explosion at about 06:30 (03:30 GMT). When he reached the scene, there was no smell, he said. He found people lying on the floor, unable to move and with constricted pupils. Opposition activists said government warplanes dropped bombs containing chemicals Mohammed Rasoul, the head of a charity ambulance service in Idlib, told the BBC that he heard about the attack at about 06:45 and that when his medics arrived 20 minutes later they found people, many of them children, choking in the street. Victims experienced symptoms including redness of the eyes, foaming from the mouth, constricted pupils, blue facial skin and lips, severe shortness of breath and asphyxiation, it added. A Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) medical team supporting the Bab al-Hawa hospital, near the Turkish border,confirmed similar symptoms in eight patients,externalthere from Khan Sheikhoun. Sarin is highly toxic and considered 20 times as deadly as cyanide. As with all nerve agents, sarin inhibits the action of the acetylcholinesterase enzyme, which deactivates signals that cause human nerve cells to fire. This blockage pushes nerves into a continual ""on"" state. The heart and other muscles - including those involved in breathing - spasm. Sufficient exposure can lead to death via asphyxiation within minutes. Sarin is almost impossible to detect because it is a clear, colourless and tasteless liquid that has no odour in its purest form. It can also evaporate and spread through the air.

"This video can not be played James Tringham, who has bipolar disorder, explains that being at work has a ""normalising effect"" Hayley Smith says her manager encouraged her to apply for other jobs when she told her she had depression. The news about her illness spread across the office. ""It was horrible - I felt really exposed,"" she says. After a few anxious, unhappy months, she left. Hayley is one of up to 300,000 people with mental health problems who leave their jobs each year, a report says. The report by mental health experts also says poor mental health costs the UK economy up to Â£99bn each year. Paul Farmer, co-author ofthe Thriving At Work report,external, said mental health was a taboo subject in many workplaces. Can you talk about mental health at work? The illness that affects one in six of us Mental health staff on stress leave up 22% Mr Farmer, who is chief executive of mental health charity Mind, said: ""Opportunities are missed to prevent poor mental health and ensure that employees who may be struggling get the support they need. ""In many instances, employers simply don't understand the crucial role they can play, or know where to go for advice and support."" The review makes 40 recommendations for how to support employees to remain at work, including creating an online wellbeing portal and using digital technology to support workers in the gig economy. Companies are also being encouraged to include a section on employee mental health in their annual reports. Currently only 11% of companies do this, the report said. Prime Minister Theresa May, who commissioned the report, said it showed ""we need to take action"". The civil service has agreed to take on the report's recommendations. Hayley Smith lost her job when she told her employer about her depression One employer the report praised is the insurer, Aviva. James Tringham, who has worked for the company for seven years, said it helped him get his life back on track after suffering with bipolar disorder. ""In 2009, I'd reached crisis point with my mental health, and I gave up my career as a solicitor,"" he says. ""I was unable to work for over a year - the prospect of returning to work was just so frightening and not something that I could imagine."" Eventually he got a job in the insurer's contact centre. ""They gave me a way back into employment and I have worked my way back up. ""Aviva have been brilliant in supporting me to manage my mental health at work, and have given me my confidence back. ""There's an understanding, which means little things like adjusting my workload when I'm feeling on the low side can really help. And the staff - both officially and unofficially - form a great support network."" Footballer Aaron Lennon returned to training after receiving mental health support Create a mental health at work plan Build mental health awareness by making information and support accessible Encourage open conversations Provide good working conditions and ensure employees have a healthy work-life balance Promote effective people management, with line managers holding regular conversations about health and well-being with their staff Routinely monitor employee mental health The review said that people with long-term mental health problems were leaving jobs at twice the rate of colleagues with no such issues, although it did say that some people may be counted twice - if they left one job, returned to work elsewhere after a break but were then unable to continue in their new post. The report also pointed out the cost to employers, estimating they were losing Â£42bn each year because of staff suffering from mental health problems. Mrs May said: ""It is only by making this an everyday concern for everyone that we change the way we see mental illness, so that striving to improve your mental health - whether at work or at home - is seen as just as positive as improving our physical well-being."" What is mental health? For Hayley Smith, support from her employer could have made her chronic depression more bearable. After leaving her job, she started her own company. Five years on, she now employs others. ""In the long term, it's given me awareness of mental health,"" she says. ""And the awareness to make sure I was never going to make people feel the way I was made to feel."" The illness that affects one in six of us Can you talk about mental health at work?

"Del Boy would be proud of this 'lovely jubbly' replica which was sold for Â£6,000 A life-sized Willy Wonka, a Terminator, and a gremlin - all previously owned by a drug dealer in England - were sold at auction in County Antrim on Thursday. Thousands of pounds worth of silver screen collectables were seized by police in Wiltshire. It followed a raid on a nuclear bunker which housed a giant cannabis farm. Martin Fillery, from Bridgwater, was jailed for eight years in August for conspiracy to produce class-B drugs. Some of the notable sales included: Back to the Future 2 Screen Used BMW - Â£20,000 Batboat - Â£15,000 Starsky and Hutch Ford replica - Â£7,500 Only Fools and Horses Replica Van - Â£6,000 Terminator 2 Statue - Â£3,100 Mini-Me Statue - Â£1,200 You could've had this four-seater replica Batboat for a splash at Â£15,000 Fillery had turned a nuclear bunker in Wiltshire into a drugs factory capable of producing Â£2m worth of cannabis a year, police said. The 46-year-old was also a film fan and a keen collector of ""boy's toys"", including a Star Wars stormtrooper, Batman's speedboat, and the car driven by Biff in the film Back to the Future. But when Fillery pleaded guilty to money laundering, his assets became subject to the proceeds of crime legislation. That means they were seized and then sold at a Wilsons Auctions in Mallusk. The firm holds government auctions every month. Or if you have a spare Â£13,000 perhaps a Batbike is more your thing? Feel those G-forces for Â£11,000! More than 150 items were up for auction, from a six-foot Iron Man which went for a solid Â£3,100 and a range of arcade games including Pac Man to a replica of Roland the Rat's car. Auctioneer Aidan Larkin said the lots, including a Mini-Me from the Austin Powers films, have attracted worldwide interest. These statues found new homes tonight. Ironman set his owner back Â£3,100, and the Terminator went for Â£5,750. ""There's an element of the man cave but there are also a lot of serious movie props and collectors will want them as an investment. ""There's a lot of Star Wars props, and there's life-size Stormtrooper outfit officially licensed by the company that provided them for the movie. ""They all have the certificates and documents."" Alongside the ET and Ewok figures, the lot featured a number of cars - including one that has starred on the big screen. 'Zebra three, zebra three' - a Starsky and Hutch replica car went for Â£7,500 ""We've got the most interest so far in the Back to the Future car,"" said Mr Larkin It was used by Biff in the film, and he famously had hover-boards attached to the back of it. It last changed hands for $25,000."" It was sold for Â£20,000. The Ratmobile, one for the 80s kids But for some, the collectibles are just that - items for film buffs to keep in their house as a memento of their favourite film. Mr Larkin said they received a lot of interest from hotels, bars and restaurants, but the ""sharp end"" of the bidding is normally from the global clientele. ""All of the money we raise goes back into the court and the public purse as part of the wider proceeds of crime case,"" he said.

"This video can not be played Students with Catalan flags chanted ""independence"" Backers and opponents of independence in Catalonia have clashed in parliament over the way forward as the Spanish government is set to reassert control. The debate began after Catalan President Carles Puigdemont did not reveal a favoured course of action, and called on MPs to decide on a response. On Friday Spain's Senate is expected to curtail the region's autonomous powers. The move follows Catalonia's independence referendum, which Spain's Constitutional Court declared illegal. Mr Puigdemont declared independence after the 1 October vote. But he immediately suspended implementation, calling for talks. The Catalan government said that of the 43% who took part in the referendum, 90% were in favour of independence. Carles Puigdemont (right) has been under pressure not to call a snap election Many people gathered in Barcelona on Thursday hoping Mr Puigdemont would declare independence. But there has also been speculation that he might call regional elections in an effort to avoid rule from Madrid. However Mr Puigdemont did neither. ""I have been prepared to call elections, as long as guarantees are given,"" he said. He added that Spain's governing Popular Party had not given such assurances - without giving any details.

"The UK government wanted to set up an internal warning system to monitor and react to decisions made by President Donald Trump, emails show. The emails reveal concerns,externalabout the impact of Mr Trump's travel ban on UK citizens and national security. Officials did not want to be caught out by similar orders issued by the US president ""just as London is going to sleep"", one official said. The emails were released to the BBC under the Freedom of Information Act. The BBC's Diplomatic Correspondent James Landale said: ""These emails show just how concerned the Foreign Office was about the flow of unexpected announcements emerging from the Trump White House and the potential impact on the UK."" ""But we have to remember that this concern was also shared by other parts of the US administration that were at times equally blindsided by the president's early morning tweets,"" added our correspondent. ""So the emails do not reflect any particular deterioration in UK-US relations. They illustrate the kind of steps foreign governments have had to consider to cope with Mr Trump's unpredictable style of government."" Most of the emails released to the BBC were between the British Embassy in Washington and the Foreign Office around the time of Mr Trump's executive order halting all refugee admissions and temporarily barring people from seven Muslim-majority countries. The order, signed on 27 January, was one of string of decrees, proclamations and orders issued by Mr Trump during his first weeks in the White House. It was signed hours after Prime Minister Theresa May became the first foreign leader to meet Mr Trump at the White House. Foreign Office officials feared the ban would prevent thousands of UK citizens with dual nationality travelling to the United States and discussed the likely impact of that on relations between Mrs May and the new president. ""BE (British Embassy) Washington have been trying to get clarity from State (The State Department) without luck so far,"" officials said in an internal Foreign Office email dated 28 January - the day after Mr Trump signed the order. ""If true, this would obviously mean thousands of dual nationals with British passports being banned from travelling to the US. Not great after the PM visit."" Another email, on the same day, said: ""The dual nationals angle will of course be really difficult for us. I'll come back to you when I have more on our response."" In the end, the new restrictions did not apply to British citizens with dual citizenship, but officials were keen not to be caught out again by the actions of President Trump. On 30 January, Kara Owen, director of the Americas desk at the Foreign Office sent an email around the Foreign Office, including to the deputy British ambassador to the US Patrick Davies, asking for a new warning system to be set up to look at the impact of Mr Trump's executive orders on British interests. ""Many of these orders will no doubt be issued just as London is going to sleep,"" she said. ""I would like us to establish a system for assessing impact of the orders on U.K. interests (if any) and offering quick advice on what to do about it to the right readership (including senior readers in FCO and Whitehall, press and private offices)."" She added: ""I would welcome any other predictions about EOs (executive orders) foreshadowed during the campaign and likely to touch on our interests - he is doing a lot of what he said he would."" The documents also reveal the EU contacted the Foreign Office to check whether Britain was attempting to get a special deal for its citizens in the aftermath of Mr Trump's travel ban - and concerns about the impact on national security. In one exchange, the Home Office's international director, Richard Clarke, discusses ""potential UK activism/adverse reaction"" in response to the travel ban, with officials at the Office for Security and Counter-Terrorism. Also released was a heavily redacted analysis of the first three weeks of the Trump presidency, including a section entitled ""Video killed the radio star"". The documents reveal civil servants expected a change in Theresa May's friendly outlook towards the US President should British citizens be banned from entering the United States. ""You might have seen that the PM didn't engage on the question on Trump's immigration policy saying they were for the US,"" said one official, referring toMrs May's press conference in Turkey on 28 January, when she was questioned about the policy. ""Presumably that changes if Brits (ie dual nationals) are blocked from entering the US?,"" replied another official. The document warned that questions on whether the government explicitly supported US immigration policy were a ""bear trap"". The emails also show Foreign Office also struggled with the weight of communications from MPs in the aftermath of the US President's executive order. One official complained of ""yet another UQ (Urgent Question to be answered in Parliament)"", in reference to a question put by former SNP MP Stuart Donaldson requesting a statement on the impact on the ban on British citizens. In addition, the emails revealed which journalists and public figures the FCO paid particular attention to. Tweets from The Guardian's Anushka Asthana and Alan Travis, Steve Hawkes of The Sun and Jack Blanchard, then of The Mirror, were circulated with Foreign Office updates. What is the Trump travel ban?

"The window display includes the message 'Wishing you an Explosive Christmas' Police in Londonderry have started an investigation after a snowman holding a rocket launcher was painted on the window of a republican support group's office. The image includes the message: ""Wishing you an Explosive Christmas."" It appeared at the office of the Irish Republican Prisoners Welfare Association, a body that supports republican inmates and their families. A former mayor of Londonderry described it as ""threatening and sinister"". The building - Junior McDaid House - is on Chamberlain Street in Derry and also houses the youth organisation Eistigi Doire as well as the dissident republican party Saoradh - named after the Irish word for liberation. BBC News NI has contacted organisations in Junior McDaid House for comment. Democratic Unionist Party councillor Drew Thompson said many people in the city would find the painting offensive. ""It sends out a message to all communities, not just to unionists, that there are those within the city who are intent in causing destruction over the festive period,"" he said. Mr Thompson added that Christmas was a time largely associated with ceasefires during Northern Ireland's Troubles. ""The intent here is certainly not in keeping with the season of peace and good will - it suggests that violence remains on the agenda."" Mr Thompson contacted the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) to ask if the display was legal.

"This video can not be played ""I learned because of Fred,"" Trump said of his brother, who was addicted to alcohol US President Donald Trump has called America's painkiller-addiction crisis a ""national shame"" as he declared it a public health emergency. Mr Trump announced a plan to target the abuse of opioids, which kill more than 140 Americans each day. The president has previously promised to declare a national emergency, which would have triggered federal funding to help states combat the drug scourge. The move instead redirects grant money to be used in dealing with the crisis. Five ways to tackle the US drug epidemic Mr Trump said on Thursday at the White House: ""More people are dying from drug overdoses today than from gun homicides and motor vehicles combined. ""These overdoses are driven by a massive increase in addiction to prescription painkillers, heroin and other opioids."" He added: ""The United States is by far the largest consumer of these drugs using more opioid pills per person than any other country by far in the world."" Mr Trump signed a presidential memorandum directing his acting health secretary to declare a nationwide public health emergency and ordering all federal agencies to take measures to reduce the number of opioid deaths, according to senior White House officials. The order will also ease some regulations to allow states more latitude in how they use federal funds to tackle the problem. But the White House plans to fund the effort through the Public Health Emergency Fund, which reportedly only contains $57,000 (Â£43,000). The Trump administration will then work with Congress to approve additional funding in a year-end spending package, senior officials said. Other elements of the directive include: Allow patients further access to ""telemedicine"" so they can receive prescriptions without seeing a doctor Make grants available to those who have had trouble finding work due to addiction The Department of Health and Human Services will hire more people to address the crisis, particularly in rural areas Allows states to shift federal funds from HIV treatments to opioids, since the two are linked as drug users often share infected needles Proponents suggest Mr Trump's announcement is a critical step in raising awareness about the nationwide epidemic, while some critics argue the move does not go far enough. ""The lack of resources is concerning to us since the opioid epidemic presenting lots of challenges for states' budgets,"" Michael Fraser, executive director of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, told Politico. ""My hope is people will realise with no new money the ball is going to be in Congress's court,""he added.,external Senator Bernie Sanders latertweeted,externalthat while Mr Trump was ""right that the opioid crisis is a national emergency"", Friday's announcement was ""nothing more than an empty promise"". ""Millions depend on Medicaid [healthcare funding] for opioid treatment. Trump's solution is to cut Medicaid by $1 trillion. That is a disgrace,"" wrote the Vermont senator. The 100 words that triggered the opioid crisis Morgue services boom in US opioid crisis Rajini Vaidyanathan, BBC News, Washington Addiction to painkillers and heroin has blighted so many communities across the US - both urban and rural. As I travelled the country reporting on last year's election, I remember the hairdresser in Arkansas whose ex-husband died from medicines he'd been given for his bad back, the family in New Hampshire who'd lost a teenage daughter to an overdose and heard stories of doctors who'd become hooked on the very pills they'd prescribed. President Trump has stopped short of declaring this crisis a national emergency, despite earlier indications he would. Instead his public health emergency is more of a short-term measure which doesn't allocate as much funding. Recovering addicts and charities I've talked to say more investment in round-the-clock rehab and treatment is what is needed to make a difference. But while today's announcement is welcome, many will now be looking to Congress to take more action and secure more money to deal with this crisis. Since 1999, the number of deaths involving opioids have quadrupled, reaching 33,000 deaths in 2015, according to the Presidential Commission on Combating Drug Addiction and the Opioid Crisis, citing data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The CDC first declared opioids, a class of pain medications as well as some street drugs, to be an ""epidemic"" in 2011. Mr Trump first announced his intention to declare opioid abuse a ""national emergency"" in August. ""The opioid crisis is an emergency, and I'm saying officially right now: It is an emergency. It's a national emergency,"" he said at the time. This video can not be played ""We're going to spend a lot of time, a lot of effort and a lot of money on the opioid crisis"" Experts had urged Mr Trump to use his presidential power under the Stafford Act to declare a national emergency, which would have given states access to money from the federal Disaster Relief Fund. States would have had immediate access to funding, much like they would after a natural disaster. But senior officials told reporters that declaring that sort of emergency was not a good fit for an ongoing crisis. The announcement comes after Mr Trump's pick for drug czar withdrew his nomination following a report that he helped neuter government attempts to tackle the opioid crisis. Controversial Trump drug czar pick withdraws Pennsylvania congressman Tom Marino pushed a bill that reportedly stripped a federal agency of the ability to freeze suspicious painkiller shipments. Health Secretary Tom Price also resigned last month after it was revealed he was using expensive private planes for official business. As a candidate, Mr Trump frequently pledged to tackle the drug crisis, and often campaigned in the hardest-hit states.

"This video can not be played Students with Catalan flags chanted ""independence"" Backers and opponents of independence in Catalonia have clashed in parliament over the way forward as the Spanish government is set to reassert control. The debate began after Catalan President Carles Puigdemont did not reveal a favoured course of action, and called on MPs to decide on a response. On Friday Spain's Senate is expected to curtail the region's autonomous powers. The move follows Catalonia's independence referendum, which Spain's Constitutional Court declared illegal. Mr Puigdemont declared independence after the 1 October vote. But he immediately suspended implementation, calling for talks. The Catalan government said that of the 43% who took part in the referendum, 90% were in favour of independence. Carles Puigdemont (right) has been under pressure not to call a snap election Many people gathered in Barcelona on Thursday hoping Mr Puigdemont would declare independence. But there has also been speculation that he might call regional elections in an effort to avoid rule from Madrid. However Mr Puigdemont did neither.

Analysis by James Reynolds, BBC News, Barcelona Spain's profound constitutional crisis in four decades of democracy is currently working its way through two competing parliaments. The country's Senate in Madrid is getting ready to approve emergency powers for the central government. Pro-independence members of the Catalan regional parliament believe that they must do something to counter any moves made in Madrid. Some parliamentarians want to go ahead and make an unequivocal unilateral declaration of Catalan independence. Pro-independence campaign groups have called for demonstrations outside the parliament building in the morning. Reacting to Mr Puigdemont's statement on Thursday, Spanish Deputy Prime Minister Soraya Saenz de Santamaria defended her government's handling of the crisis. She said the Spanish model was ""one of the most decentralised in the world"". She added: ""We've always shown our sincere desire to collaborate. The pro-independence camp have made it clear they don't want dialogue."" The parliamentary session in Barcelona is now suspended, and will resume on Friday morning. It is expected to vote on whether to declare unilateral independence or not. Also on Friday the Senate is due to hold a vote on the government's plan to trigger Article 155 of the Spanish constitution. Under the proposals announced by Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy this week, Mr Puigdemont would be removed and new regional elections held. Madrid would take control of Catalonia's finances, police and public media. Mr Rajoy's centre-right government has a majority in the Senate. The plan has also been approved by opposition parties.

"A woman who bought a combat knife and training dummy for her husband has been found guilty of helping him prepare for a planned terror attack in Birmingham. Madihah Taheer, 21, from the city, denied preparing an act of terrorism by assisting her husband Ummariyat Mirza earlier this year. Woolwich Crown Court heard the husband and wife team had developed their plans after falling in love as teenagers. She has been remanded in custody and will be sentenced at a later date. In March, armed police arrested the husband at gunpoint in Birmingham. The couple who put IS at the heart of their marriage They acted on MI5 intelligence that Mirza was going to carry out a rampaging knife attack, similar to those seen this year in London. His arrest on 29 March came exactly one week after theWestminster Bridge terror attackin London. The court was told the pair had initially hoped to travel to Syria to aid the Islamic State group - but decided to carry out an attack in their home city instead. West Midlands counter-terror officers said they discovered a list of potential targets, including military sites in the area. Taheer also allowed her debit card to be used to buy a plastic knife and a lifelike training dummy so that her husband could practise an attack, the court heard. The dummy was found in their home with slash marks on the forehead, across the throat and abdomen. The court was shown the dummy Mirza made his wife buy, usually sold for use in martial arts The jury at Woolwich Crown Court took less than a day to convict Taheer. The jurors were shown a text message that Taheer sent to Mirza in September 2015, before the couple were married. ""Can we get married already,"" she wrote. ""I want u to kill ppl for me. I have a list."" The court was shown another message she sent to Mirza a month later, where Taheer said it was her ""dream"" to hurt or kill a person the pair both knew. He responded by sending her a video of him making stabbing motions towards a chair - and asking her to buy him a knife. Mirza made Taheer return the first dummy she purchased as it was not the model he wanted Mirza, a former accountant, pleaded guilty to the plotting charge earlier this month, and is also due to be sentenced. His older sister, Zainub Mirza, pleaded guilty in October to sending him terrorist material, including a video showing an IS hostage being beheaded. Sue Hemming, of the Crown Prosecution Service, said the messages showed Taheer was a ""willing accomplice"" who knew what the knife would be used for. She said: ""This couple posed a serious threat to the public in Britain and now face the prospect of time in prison where they will no longer be a danger.""

"This video can not be played The Bloodhound car is tested ahead of its 1,000mph record attempt The Bloodhound Super Sonic Car has conducted its first public runs. Using just the thrust of its jet engine, the vehicle raced to 210mph (340km/h) down the runway at Newquay Airport in southwest England. Ultimately,Bloodhound,externalwill be fitted with a rocket motor as well so that it can go 1,000mph (1,610km/h). That will not happen for two to three years, but the Newquay tests have given the team confidence that the car can achieve its designed performance. Driven by RAF Wing Commander Andy Green, Bloodhound SSC made two trips down Newquay's 1.7-mile (2.7km) runway. Diary: Jet engine's stamp of approval Supersonic car fires up jet engine Chinese auto group backs Bloodhound Climb inside Andy Green's cockpit More than 3,000 VIPs and members of the Bloodhound supporters club were in attendance to see the Eurofighter EJ200 jet engine take the vehicle from a standing start to 200mph in about eight seconds. As well as the ear-splitting noise, the crowd was treated to the bright glare of the engine on reheat. ""We did two back-to-back 200mph runs in a five-tonne car. It felt like about eight seconds, which was what we were expecting,"" Wing Commander Green said on stepping out of the cockpit. ""It was a real hard work-out for the brakes. Probably up to somewhere close to a thousand degrees, the front brakes were smoking furiously after the second run. They just started to flicker with flame - very sort of Formula One, but in a proper high-speed car. And that was exactly what we were hoping for,"" he told BBC News. This video can not be played Bloodhound: Numbers of the beast These ""slow-speed"" trials are really at the limit of what can be done here in the UK. To go faster, Bloodhound will have to head abroad. Next year, it hopes to be on Hakskeen Pan in Northern Cape, South Africa. This dried-out lake bed is super-flat and extends for 12 miles (19km), providing ample space to get up to some very high speeds and then slow and stop safely. Bloodhound still awaits its rocket motor which will go in the hole below the jet engine Testing in Newquay these past few weeks makes the team believe the car can attain 650mph (1,050km/h) with just the EJ200. That is not enough to break the world land speed record (763mph/1,227km/h), but it would take the vehicle into a performance region where engineers would learn a lot more about its capabilities. At over 400mph, the wheels can no longer turn as fast as the car moves and act more like the rudders on a boat. And at 650mph, some of the airflows over Bloodhound's body would approach the sound barrier. This is all knowledge needed to go 800mph in 2019, and then up to 1,000mph in 2020 - when the rocket technology becomes available. This video can not be played Meet Ron Ayers. the 85-year-old aerodynamicist behind the Bloodhound car This is currently being developed by the Norwegian aerospace and defence company Nammo. The Scandinavian firm expects to have two versions available for Bloodhound. The first - a so-called monopropellant motor - should provide sufficient additional thrust to set a new land speed record. The second - what is termed a hybrid motor - will be even more powerful and will be incorporated into Bloodhound following some aerodynamic upgrades to its rear end. ""The total thrust we think we need is about 20 tonnes. So that's a thrust-to-weight ratio of about two-and-a-half. The car when we're breaking records will weigh about eight tonnes,"" said Bloodhound technical director, Mark Chapman. One other significant change to the car by then could be the introduction of a major electric component. The rocket will need oxidiser pushed through it and at the moment the motor destined to drive the pump is a V8 from a Jaguar sports car. But such have been the advances in batteries and capacitors in recent years, the team now thinks these technologies could take over the role of the internal combustion engine. The swap might also give more flexibility to engineers as they look to redistribute weight around the car as it targets higher and higher speeds. Two more days of public running lie ahead. One is on Saturday, for which a few tickets remain,external. The other is on Monday, organised with Cornwall County Council and aimed at local secondary schools. Education is a primary motivation for the Bloodhound project - to inspire children in their study of STEM subjects. Jess Herbert is a product of this initiative. She won an apprenticeship with Rolls-Royce after Bloodhound got her interested in engineering, and even acts now as one of the project's education ambassadors. ""The outreach team - they go out to schools and do workshops and presentations,"" she explained. ""Recently at Rolls-Royce, we ran a 'bring your daughter to work day', where we built rocket-powered cars inspired by Bloodhound. And it was incredible; they loved it.""

"Malthe has been in films such as Elektra and Lake Placid Norwegian actress and model Natassia Malthe has accused Harvey Weinstein of raping her in a London hotel room after the 2008 Bafta awards ceremony. She told a press conference in New York she met Weinstein at an after party and felt pressured into telling him she was staying at the Sanderson Hotel. Malthe alleges Weinstein banged on her door, she let him in and he raped her. Weinstein has previously issued a statement saying he denies all allegations of non-consensual sex. Weinstein faces losing CBE Harvey Weinstein's accusers How the Harvey Weinstein scandal unfolded In a separate development, Reuters reports that Weinstein is suing the Weinstein Co, the firm he founded and until recently was co-chairman of. In the lawsuit filed in Delaware's Court of Chancery, Weinstein said he needed the information to prevent the company from being harmed by unjustified legal settlements, and to find out whether the board and executives wrongfully terminated him from his post there. Malthe, who has appeared in films including This Means War alongside Reese Witherspoon, Tom Hardy and Chris Pine, said she was asleep when she was awoken by Weinstein's ""repeated pounding"" on the door. She said she heard someone yelling: ""Open the door Natassia Malthe, it's Harvey Weinstein."" Malthe claimed when she opened the door, Weinstein implied sex would get her a role in an upcoming film and then began to masturbate in front of her. She said he then ""pushed me back and forced himself onto me. It was not consensual. He did not use a condom"". She added: ""I was completely grossed out. I believe that I disassociated during the time that he was having sex with me. I laid still and closed my eyes and just wanted it to end. I was like a dead person. Afterwards I lay there in complete disgust."" Weinstein has ""unequivocally denied"" all allegations of non-consensual sex She said she received a script the next day and then returned to Los Angeles. Malthe said she was given the impression she had landed a role in the movie Nine, a film produced by Weinstein that would star Daniel Day-Lewis, Nicole Kidman and Dame Judi Dench. Malthe said Weinstein later asked her to meet him at the Beverly Hills Peninsula Hotel, telling her an assistant would be present. But Malthe said when she got there, he instead asked her to engage in a threesome with him and another woman. She says she refused and when she later called him to turn down a role in one of his films, he became angry and verbally abusive. ""I had experienced sexual harassment from other powerful men in Hollywood, but my experiences with Harvey were the worst,"" Malthe said. Her lawyer Gloria Allred said Malthe is ""considering"" whether to make a report to police over the allegation. The news comes the day after a former production assistant, Mimi Haleyi, also accused Weinstein of rape when he forciblyperformed oral sex on her without her consent,externalin 2006. Another actress and model, Dominique Huett, also said she was raped by Weinstein when he allegedly forcibly performed oral sex on her. She has nowhas become the first woman to sue The Weinstein Company,external, alleging a single count of negligence. Dozens of women have made accusations against Weinstein this month, including rape and sexual assault. He has ""unequivocally denied"" all allegations of non-consensual sex.

"This video can not be played ""Sometimes it's worth waiting 40 years,"" said Bill A couple kept apart by the woman's father have married almost 40 years later - after the man proposed on BBC Radio 4. Bill Brookman originally asked Madeleine Coburn to go to the pub with him in 1978, when he was 23 and she was 16, but she was forbidden from going. Their paths crossed again in 2008 and Bill later asked Madeleine out again. They were telling their story to The Listening Projectwhen Bill popped the question. ""The hand of fate is very strange but what I must say is sometimes it's worth waiting 40 years,"" Bill said. Madeleine said she and Bill were ""very lucky"" to have found each other again Madeleine remembers seeing Bill around Loughborough in Leicestershire, where they still live, when she was a child. He went to school with her brother when, according to Bill, she was ""the little sister of no importance whatsoever"". However, they got to know each other better in 1978 when Bill directed a play that 16-year-old Madeleine was taking part in. He asked her on a date and she said yes, but her father thought Bill was ""too arty"" and would not let her see him. ""I was disappointed, but that's just the way life is,"" said Bill, who had no idea why she had cancelled the date. Madeleine was 16 when a 23-year-old Bill originally asked her out Madeleine - a specialist in the heritage and arts sector - never married, but performer Bill had two sons with a previous wife. They met again in 2008 when they collaborated on a school project in Leicester. Four years later he plucked up the courage to ask Madeleine out again. After they became a couple, Bill took her to the pub he had originally intended to go to on their date decades before. ""That was very sweet,"" said Madeleine. Bill proposed to Madeleine when they were recording a conversation for The Listening Project Bill proposed while their conversation was being recorded by BBC Radio 4, but Madeleine did not give an answer at the time. However, the radio producer asked them to pose for a photo afterwards, which was when the bride-to-be said yes. ""The fact we didn't go out together when we were younger meant that we've both lived very rich lives,"" said Madeleine. ""Then we found each other again, and it was a special thing that happened to us, so I think we're very lucky."" Producer Namrata Varia said: ""It was a privilege to record The Listening Project's first ever marriage proposal. ""It took me by complete surprise. To be honest I'm not sure who was more surprised by it - me, Madeleine or Bill."" The pair married in August The couple who waited 40 years for love.

"Police said the charge against Mr Lythgoe was related to Labour MP Rosie Cooper A man arrested as part of an investigation into the far-right group, National Action, has been charged with encouragement to commit murder. The BBC understands the charge against Christopher Lythgoe, 31, from Cheshire, relates to Labour MP Rosie Cooper. He is one of six men charged with being members of the banned group. A 22-year-old man, from Lancashire, who cannot be named, has also been charged with the intention of committing acts of terrorism and ""threats to kill"". All six are to appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court on Friday. National Action became the first far-right organisation to be banned in the UK in December 2016. It means that being a member of or inviting support for the organisation is a criminal offence carrying a sentence of up to 10 years' imprisonment. Ms Cooper said: ""I would like to thank everyone involved in this case, especially the counter-terrorism police, for keeping me, my staff and the public safe. ""There remains an ongoing criminal investigation so it would not be appropriate for me to comment further."" By Dominic Casciani, BBC home affairs correspondent National Action became the first British neo-Nazi group to be banned last December after Home Secretary Amber Rudd said it was promoting violence and acts of terrorism. Members and supporters applauded the murder of Jo Cox MP by a white supremacist - and the group had carried out a series of small, but confrontational, demonstrations in towns and cities throughout England. One of its most notorious events saw masked members - many of them very young men - gathering outside York Minster to make Hitler salutes. Since it was banned, detectives have been carrying out more and more investigations into the group which, to all intents and purposes, has organised itself in a similar way to the banned al Muhajiroun network - the extremist Islamist youth movement. Both have used social media to target young people, attracting them with a simplistic us-and-them message designed to make them angry. The charges follow a number of raids across England and Wales by counter-terrorism officers as part of a national investigation into the group. The others charged with belonging to a proscribed organisation are: Garron Helm, 24, of Seaforth, Merseyside Matthew Hankinson, 23, of Newton-le-Willows, Merseyside Andrew Clarke, 33, of Warrington Michael Trubini, 35, of Warrington A spokeswoman for Greater Manchester Police said the men were charged following ""co-ordinated activity"" by police.

"Madihah Taheer: Convicted of preparing an act of terrorism Three members of the same family have been convictedfor being part of what could have been a major terror attack on the streets of Birmingham. Prosecutors say that at the centre of the plot foiled earlier this year were a husband-and-wife team who put the self-styled Islamic State's cause at the centre of their marriage. At the top of 21-year-old Madihah Taheer's Facebook profile is a painting depicting what appears to be a Muslim warrior from antiquity, galloping away from battle with a maiden clinging tightly to him. She gazes lovingly into his eyes. She is in the arms of her conquering hero. That was the life for the failed A-Level student from Birmingham. She dreamt of escaping her cannabis-smoking dad who had tried to marry her off to her first cousin. The romantic vision Madihah Taheer sought And she thought she had found her hero in Ummariyat Mirza. A life as heroes in Syria. Except the dream ended in squabbles over whether to spend money on weapons or baby clothes  - and her husband wrestled to the floor by armed police. Ummariyat Mirza, also known as Ummar, and his sister Zainub were arrested on 29 March as they drove through Alum Rock in east Birmingham. Plain clothes officers had covertly followed them in a joint operation by MI5 and the West Midlands Counter Terrorism Unit. Ummar Mirza: Pleaded guilty Just a week after the Westminster Bridge attack, intelligence indicated Mirza was planning some kind of similar knife-led rampage in his home city. Earlier this month he admitted preparing an act of terrorism. Prosecutors said that Mirza had: Bought a knife after teaching himself the best way to kill someone on a martial arts dummy at home Devised a way to conceal the weapon with cord turned into a harness over his shoulder Researched potential targets including the city's RAF careers office and Birmingham's central synagogue Martial arts dummy: Used by Mirza to train Days later, as the trial of Mirza's sister approached, Zainub Mirza admitted encouraging him by sharing extremist videos that cemented his mindset. The wife, Madihah Taheer, denied being involved. But today, a jury at Woolwich Crown Court found she was also guilty of preparing an act of terrorism by buying the knife her husband would use - and knowing what he would use it for. Over the course of her trial, Taheer denied that allegation - but the jury at Woolwich Crown Court heard that her relationship with her husband, which began as a teenager's obsessive love, was at the heart of their plots, schemes, plans and fantasies. Taheer was 17 and at sixth form when she met her future husband. It was a secret love. She said she wanted to escape her family and charismatic Mirza said he was going places. In their bedrooms, via mobile phones and iPads, they played out their dreams. He would be the big hero mujahideen fighter giving it to President Assad in Syria and any other Kuffar, the unbelievers. She was the jihadi-bride to-be, inspired by an infamous blog, written by another young woman who had married a fighter in Syria. ""OMG man she made me want it so bad,"" she messaged to her secret boyfriend. ""She's honest and it's beautiful man. Just raw and proper life."" In Whatsapp chats, Mirza described himself to his love as a ""terrorist who doesn't wanna live that long"" and they agreed they should aim to reach Syria within a year of marriage. But Taheer wanted her husband-to-be to first take care of a few local people who had challenged her thinking. ""Can we get married already ffs?,"" said Taheer in late 2015. ""I want you to kill people for me I have a list."" ""The day of niqqah [the marriage] I will kill them all, give me the list,"" replied Mirza. ""You can't have it until you put a ring on it,"" she said. They squabbled over who was the most radical and they laughed at videos of IS killings, hostage beheadings and terrorism attacks. ""I hope our babies look like you. Your [sic] perfect,"" messaged Taheer one day. ""Do you want a boy or girl first?"" ""Boy cuz I want a male best best jihadi friend I don't have none :( so when I'm 40 I'll have a rest [sic] friend who is 20 and he'll be jihadi and funny and my bestest friend,"" he said. As their April 2016 wedding approached, their messages to each other showed Syria was fading into the background. Attacking at home loomed into view. ""You are a perfect partner and soulja and soulmate,"" wrote Mirza. ""What I have in mind is very sophisticated. I need a right hand."" His girlfriend replied: ""If we get married then u know I'm up for it."" Madihah Taheer with her partner's air rifle Throughout her evidence, Taheer said this talk was just a joke. A sick joke that she was now ashamed of, but it had been ""their humour"". She said she had been brainwashed into following IS by a charming but increasingly manipulative young man. ""I was just turned 17 and he was still 16,"" she told the court. ""He was a difficult person to be in a relationship with, very controlling, very jealous and it became clear to me quite early in the relationship that he suffered from depression."" Taheer said her future husband's helplessness and search for answers alighted on IS. ""Talking about Islamic State gave him a distraction,"" she told the jury. ""I was sucked into it as well. In hindsight I see that he was egging me on. I do not have those beliefs now. I was completely wrong, immature and stupid."" Taheer told the jury that she began using ploys to humour her husband rather than challenge him. One, she said, had been to delay a departure date for Syria because her eyesight was poor. ""Ummar, I'm not making Hijrah [moving to Syria] without getting the laser [eye surgery] done first,"" she said. ""You shut up,"" he replied. They have the facilities there ok."" ""Imagine if we're on the run and my glasses break. We're f*ed. I don't wanna be reliant on something to help me see."" Following their April 2016 wedding, Taheer said the reality of working for a living as a nursery administrator and her subsequent pregnancy dispelled her fantasies. She said she woke up to IS heroes. ""When you are brainwashed into something, it takes a long time to get out of it,"" she told the jury. ""I came out of my bubble and began to see the world for what it really was. ""Love is blind. I did not realise that I was under that kind of manipulation."" The case against Mirza, to which he pleaded guilty, was that his plans crystallised early in 2017. His obsessive character - which involved nagging his wife to buy him ""toys"", turned to asking her to buy him a Â£300 combat knife. Arrest: Filmed by witnesses The prosecution's case was that given their history, Taheer knew what her husband was planning. Her only concern was the cost. ""It is too much money,"" she messaged him from work when he told her what he wanted to buy. ""Can't we wait until I get paid. Got bills to pay - baby things to buy. It doesn't have to be bloody state of the art."" Mirza persisted. ""This isn't a fantasy, it's real,"" he said. ""We are living like kuffar [disbelievers]."" Eventually, on 21 February, Taheer bought her husband a knife for Â£120 - the key evidence against her. The knife bought by Madihah Taheer And he had been training how to use it on a martial arts dummy at home. On 20 March, Mirza wrote the following to a family group chat: ""We should try to avoid making all of these big claims of what we can do and how we're going [sic] give victory to Islam. Just do it, don't talk about it.' A week after the Westminster attack, he posted a single picture to his Whatsapp account: an emoticon of a knife. It looked like a signal. The police moved in and his plans were smashed. Taheer said she had no idea that her husband genuinely intended to carry out an attack. But the jury did not believe her - and she was found guilty of a single act of preparing an act of terrorism. During one particularly stormy moment in Taheer and Mirza's relationship, she told him: ""I regret meeting you, talking to you, listening."" Once they are sentenced, she may have a very long time to think about that regret.

""There is a culture - especially within offices - that perceives this as a sign of weakness or an inability to handle their work."" Stephanie places the blame on a culture of long working days, with managers very often making their team feel guilty for even taking their lunch hours.

Daisy says she is lucky to have a supportive employer Daisy from Tauntonhas experienced two different sides to coping with mental health issues at work. Daisy worked with a local authority, but says ""I could see them looking for excuses to get rid of me. ""I left the job because I couldn't stand the environment and lack of support."" Moving from the public to private sector was a revelation. ""I was honest with my new employers about my mental health issues, and their first reaction was, 'It's not a problem'. ""This was such a different attitude that I was completely taken aback"". When she suffered a mental health setback, support was on hand: ""My employer offered me a session with a private psychiatrist to help them understand my condition better and to get an independent medical review. ""I was finally given a diagnosis of Borderline Personality Disorder, combined with my existing diagnoses of PTSD, depression and anxiety. ""My employer's support has saved my life"".

She discovered taking an active approach was the first step toward recovery. ""The medical system helped,"" she says. ""I was very fortunate to get psychological help very quickly and my doctor monitored my progress. ""But it was me who asked if I could come off my medication under supervision"". Lorna also switched to part-time work, which eased the pressure. She now works five half days and uses tools including mindfulness, essential oils and journal-writing to maintain her mental health.

"This video can not be played Karen shares her thoughts about abortion One in three women will have an abortion in their lifetime, yet it is rarely talked about. For some, making the decision can be traumatic and have a long-lasting effect. For others, it is an empowering, life-changing choice. You have been sharing your experiences of abortion with us50 years after the 1967 Abortion Act was passed,external. Louise in London:""When I was 23 I found out I was pregnant. I have never regretted having an abortion. It helped cement my views on not wanting children. ""At first I put my lack of period down to stress. It felt like I had really bad PMT. Then one day at work I had to lie on the floor because I was so tired. I wondered what was wrong with me, and then the penny dropped. ""I took a pregnancy test in my lunch hour. As soon as I saw the positive result I remember violently shaking. I wanted to laugh and cry at the same time. ""A colleague who'd been trying to get pregnant was beaming when I told her. When I said it wasn't a good thing for me, she was wonderful. She just gave me a hug. ""My partner left me to deal with everything on my own. We never had a proper conversation about the abortion. My closest friends were supportive. ""My GP was matter-of-fact about it. I had two phone interviews with nurses before I went ahead. At no point did they ask me if I thought I was doing the right thing. I was certain. The procedure was excruciatingly painful because I chose not to have an anaesthetic, but it was brief. ""When I left, the stress I'd been feeling in the run-up to the procedure was gone. I felt relieved, buoyant and really happy."" Jessis 24 and had an abortion last year.

I thought it was because we were drinking but someone joked that I was pregnant and then I found out I was. ""My boyfriend didn't really say anything about it and let me make the decision about what to do. My mum was very relaxed and calm and said I should do what I wanted to do. ""But a lot of people kept telling me that I was too young and not ready to have a baby. I felt very pressured into having an abortion. It broke my heart. ""I had a breakdown soon afterwards because I was so upset. I felt I'd made the wrong decision but I couldn't do anything about it. ""My doctor gave me medication and counselling.

It was like I was forced into a corner and not able to have this baby because I couldn't afford it. ""It was very upsetting waking up from the anaesthetic. I was over three months so had to have a surgical procedure. It was awful. I woke up wanting to know what had happened to my body, but also not wanting to know.

"A group of 100 Cambridge students have called for the university to include more black and ethnic minority writers in its English Literature curriculum, leading to a row over race. But the university has condemned the backlash and says it supports debate over its reading list. The literary rowstarted with a letter,externalwritten in June by the students to the university's English faculty, asking it to ""decolonise"" its curriculum by including more BME writers. The letter, mainly signed by white students, stated: ""This is not a call for the exclusion of white men from reading lists... it is a call to recentre the lives of other marginalised writers."" One of the students, Lola Olufemi, women's officer for Cambridge University's student union,then explained the position in an article for the university's student newspaper Varsity.,externalShe wrote that it was ""simply not enough"" for the university to offer one optional course to read post-colonial BME texts at the end of a three year degree. Cambridge University defended its student Lola Olumfemi Her picture was splashed on the front page of theDaily Telegraph,externalon Wednesday under the headline: ""Student forces Cambridge to drop white authors"". The paper then faced criticism for ""twisting the facts"" and ""demonising"" Ms Olufemi. Lola Olumfemi speaks to BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour The university has responded by saying it supports ""robust academic debate"" and that ""very early"" academic discussions had already been held on this issue. But for now it said, there ""has been no decision to alter the way English is taught at the University of Cambridge"". So what do students studying English Literature at Cambridge read and why? Thecourse outline advises students,externalthey will be studying a full range of ""English literature from the Middle Ages to the present day"". Across the three years, it lists four compulsory papers that must be taken by all students: English Literature and its Contexts 1300-1550 Shakespeare Practical Criticism Tragedy There are also more than 20 optional papers - ""which change regularly"", with lecturers providing suggested reading lists and students making decisions on what books to study based on that guidance. But some students say all too often they are steered towards white, male writers. One of the lecturers is Dr Priyamvada Gopal, who teaches postcolonial literature. She says she has noticed ""more assertiveness"" from students about what kinds of issues they want to explore. Because many have not learned about the British Empire while at school, she says, this makes them keen to study books that examine the issues of Britishness or Englishness, and ""how that relates to questions of race, immigration and even class"". So what should be on the agenda? Dr Gopal has five books she suggests are worthy of inclusion: Writers Olaudah Equiano, CLR James, Sam Selvon Recommended reading from Dr Priyamvada Gopal, Reader in Anglophone Literatures and Fellow at Churchill College, Cambridge: The Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah Equiano by Olaudah Equiano Olaudah Equianowas a black African writer whose experiences as a slave prompted him to become involved in Britain's abolition movement. His autobiography was first published in 1789 and was immensely popular. The Lonely Londoners by Sam Selvon The son of an Indian father and a Scottish-Indian mother, Sam Selvon moved to England in 1950 after serving in the Trinidadian navy. The Lonely Londoners is perhaps his best-known and commercially most successful novel and was his first to address the migrant experience. The Black Jacobins by CLR James Caribbean intellectual and political activistCyril Lionel Robert Jamesmoved to England from Trinidad in 1932. Six years later he published the historical account, The Black Jacobins, his seminal work on the Haitian slave revolt. The Emperor's Babe by Bernardine Evaristo Born in London to an English mother and Nigerian father, Bernardine Evaristo is an award-winning author and current professor of creative writing at Brunel University London. Published in 2001, The Emperor's Babe is a mash-up of culture and history, set in Roman London. The Times crowned it the ""Book of the Decade"". Feminist Fables by Suniti Namjoshi Indian-born Suniti Namjoshi's first book of fiction, Feminist Fables, was published in 1981. An important figure in contemporary Indian literature in English, she is known for exploring issues of gender, sexual and cultural identity. Mariam said the discussion ""had been happening in non-academic circles for a long time"" Mariam Ansar, who helped draft the open letter, said it came as a ""result of years of frustration felt as an undergraduate, as a student of colour studying English at Cambridge"". The 22-year-old from Bradford graduated this summer and said: ""This discussion had been happening in non-academic circles for a long time."" Fellow graduate Rebecca Hirst, 21, from Chester, said: ""At the moment a system exists at Cambridge whereby a student could complete an entire literature degree without studying the writings of a person of colour or the context of slavery and colonialism in any depth."" Lizzie said adding to the list of authors would help ""challenge"" conceptions of Englishness Cambridge student Lizzie Bowes, 19, from Peterborough, criticised those who are ""too quick"" to fall back on the argument that there are no BME authors of the same calibre as William Shakespeare, Geoffrey Chaucer or John Milton. ""As a BME student myself, being constantly told that BME authors are excluded from the canon and the curriculum simply because they're 'not good enough' is hugely disheartening and alienating,"" she said. Miss Bowes said adding to the list of authors would help students ""challenge and interrogate the dominant conceptions of Englishness"". Stella Swain, in her second year at Cambridge, pointed to the ""disturbing lack"" of non-white authors on the course and said it made the English Literature degree appear ""archaic"". Finley claims most academics ""don't seem to take BME writers into consideration"" Cambridge student Finley Kidd, 19, from Norwich, who signed the letter, said the problems with the English literature curriculum begins well before university level. She said: ""Britain's history of colonialism, empire, and institutional racism is one such context that has been so fundamental in shaping our literature that we can make no excuses for ignoring it. ""My high school English curriculum was similarly whitewashed.  I have had some incredible lecturers and supervisors during my degree who have encouraged my reading of authors such as Chinua Achebe and Ngugi wa Thiong'o, but the majority of academics I've come across don't seem to take BME writers into consideration. ""The onus should not be on students to reach beyond reading lists - many may not realise they are even allowed [to do so] - but on academics to diversify their reading lists.""

"When it comes to taking opioids, the United States has the dubious honour of leading the world. For every one million Americans, almost 50,000 doses of opioids are taken every day. That's four times the rate in the UK. There are often good reasons for taking opioids. Cancer patients use them for pain relief, as do patients recovering from surgery (codeine and morphine are opioids, for example). But take too many and you have a problem. And America certainly has a problem. In two years, the town of Kermit in West Virginia received almost nine million opioid pills,according to a congressional committee.,external Just 400 people live in Kermit. Nationally, opioids killed more than 33,000 people in 2015,according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,external. That figure includes deaths from heroin, an illegal opioid. But almost half involved a prescription opioid - that is, a painkiller available from a pharmacy with a note from a doctor. So why does America - more than any country in the world - have an opioid problem? There is more than one cause. But these are some of the most important. Unlike most European countries, the US does not have universal healthcare paid for by taxes. Instead, Americans must get their own insurance - usually via an employer or the government. ""Most insurance, especially for poor people, won't pay for anything but a pill,"" says Professor Judith Feinberg from the West Virginia University School of Medicine. ""Say you have a patient that's 45 years old. They have lower back pain, you examine them, they have a muscle spasm. ""Really the best thing is physical therapy, but no one will pay for that. So doctors get very ready to pull out the prescription pad. ""Even if the insurance covers physical therapy, you probably need prior authorisation (from the insurer) - which is a lot of time and paperwork."" The CDC says opioid prescriptions have fallen by 18% from their peak in 2010. But the total is stillthree times higher than in 1999,external. The US and New Zealand are the only countries that allow prescription drugs to be advertised on television. According to the research firm Kantar, spending on advertising by pharmaceutical companies in the USreached $6.4 billion in 2016,external- a rise of 64% since 2012. None of the 10 most-advertised brands in 2016 was an opioid. But mass-marketing of drugs has an effect, says Professor Feinberg. ""As a clinician, people will come and say 'I saw this on TV - can you give me this drug'. ""Sometimes they were so confused, they were already on the drug - they were using the brand name, where I used the generic name."" In 2015, the American Medical Associationcalled for a ban,externalon adverts for prescription drugs. It didn't happen. Three months later, the extent of America's opioid culture was seen at half-time of the Superbowl - the country's most expensive advertising slot. A 60-second ad was devoted to opioid-induced constipation. The advert - paid for by AstraZeneca - advised sufferers to visit their doctor and ""ask about prescription treatment options"". President Obama's chief of staff was not impressed. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

In the US, it is common for drug companies to court doctors, in an effort to promote their products. ""When you're a doctor in the US, these detailing people (salespeople) come in from the industry,"" says Professor Keith Humphreys from Stanford University. ""They are invariably smooth, friendly, attractive, sharply dressed, adorable, they're giving out gifts to everybody. They host dinners, they sponsor conferences, they sponsor junkets. ""That is going to affect prescribing."" For the past four years, the US government haspublished the amounts,externalpaid by drug and device companies to doctors and teaching hospitals. The total in 2016 was more than $8bn. More than 630,000 physicians had payment records. For example, Purdue Pharma - which makes OxyContin, a popular opioid painkiller - made almost 80,000 transactions in 2016, worth more than $7m in total. In 2016, a study looked at the link between doctors, the free meals they received from drug companies, and the medication they prescribed. The study found receiving free meals was ""associated with an increased rate of prescribing the promoted brand-name medication"". Pharmaceutical companies say their reps are merely sharing information with doctors. But Professor Humphreys says there is a ""corrupting"" influence. ""We need a pharma industry, it's not that it's wrong,"" he says. ""But you can't let the fox guard the hen house. ""I would create completely clear blue water between the people that manufacture drugs and all the training and operation of the healthcare system."" Pharmaceutical companies also spend money on health care workers and organisations in other countries. In the UK in 2016,companies gave Â£116m ($153m),externalto health workers and organisations for non-research and development in 2016. But, although the UK figure is 7% higher than in 2015, it is less than 2% of the amount paid in the US. This video can not be played The grandparents' burden: 'We don't resent the kids - but life's hard' Dr Richard Frank is professor of health economics at Harvard Business School, and served in the Health Department from 2009 to 2016, during President Obama's administration. He thinks medical training in the US has not been good enough. ""Physicians have received almost no training in pain management,"" he says. ""Until recently they have been under some pretty important misconceptions about how addictive various products are."" He adds: ""A couple of years ago I testified before congress when I was in government. One of the representatives, before going into congress, was a thoracic surgeon. ""He noted that he had gotten almost no training in pain management - and what he had learned came entirely from the nursing staff he worked with."" This video can not be played The heroin-ravaged city in West Virginia fighting back against drug companies Dr Frank says medical training isn't the only reason for America's opioid problem. ""There's plenty of blame to go round,"" he says. But his criticism is echoed by Professor Judith Feinberg. ""Doctors didn't learn anything about addiction at medical school,"" she says. ""That is now changing, but everyone who's a doctor already, didn't learn anything. I learned about opioid drugs in the part of pharmacology where we learned about anaesthesia. ""Probably the whole topic of anaesthesia-like drugs was two hours. People don't have much knowledge about opioids. There was no curriculum that includes addiction."" In 1980, Dr Hershel Jick wrote a short letter to the New England Journal of Medicine. It said that ""despite widespread use of narcotic drugs in hospitals, the development of addiction is rare in medical patients with no history of addiction"". The claim has been debunked, and the letter now carries anonline warning note,external. But Dr Jick's letter had a big impact. This year, Canadian researchers said the letter had been cited 600 times - usually to claim opioids weren't addictive. This video can not be played ""We're going to spend a lot of time, a lot of effort and a lot of money on the opioid crisis"" In the late 1990s the Veterans Health Administration - which runs healthcare for military veterans - pushed for pain to be recognised as the ""fifth vital sign"". This gave pain equal status with blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and temperature. Then in 2001, the Joint Commission - which certifies almost 21,000 US health organisations and programmes - established standards for pain assessment and treatment. In 2016, the JC released a statement that claimed that ""everyone is looking for someone to blame"" for the opioid problem. It insisted that its 2001 standards did not ""require the use of drugs to manage a patient's pain"". Five ways to tackle the US drug epidemic The 100 words that triggered the opioid crisis Morgue services boom in US opioid crisis But Professor Feinberg says the VHA and JC's moves meant doctors were under pressure to prescribe strong painkillers - such as opioids - when they may not have been necessary. ""By the time you reach middle age, it's a rare person who doesn't ache somewhere,"" she says. She adds that - in a country where patientsrate their doctors,external, and low ratings can affect doctors' earnings - the score can be influenced by whether patients receive opioids. Some Americans, says Professor Keith Humphreys from Stanford University, believe that life is ""fixable"". ""I'm 51,"" he says. ""If I go to an American doctor and say 'Hey - I ran the marathon I used to run when I was 30, now I'm all sore, fix me', my doctor will probably try to fix me. ""If you do that in France the doctor would say 'It's life, have a glass of wine - what do you want from me?'"" In 2016, a study compared how Japanese and American doctors prescribed opioids. It found that Japanese doctors treated acute pain with opioids in 47% of cases - compared to 97% in the US. ""There is obviously a willingness, and a habit, of giving opioid pain relief that is not shared elsewhere,"" says Professor Feinberg. ""Other countries deal with pain in much healthier ways.""

"This video can not be played Rebecca says that on seeing her foster parents are Muslim, one friend said, 'I bet they have bombs in their house'. Since moving in with Pakistani Muslim foster parents, Rebecca Brown - who is white British - has had school friends ask if she lives with terrorists, because of their religion. She wants people to know they are just like any other family. ""I am a part of the family,"" Rebecca explains over a family dinner with Shanaz and Muhammad Arshad, her foster parents. Rebecca, who is an atheist, has lived with the Muslim family since the age of 12. Now 18, she has chosen to continue living with them. She is keen to make her voice heard only weeks aftera case involving a five-year-old Christian girl, who was reportedly left distressed after being placed with Muslim foster carers, hit the headlines. A family court judge later ruled there were no concerns about the girl's welfare. Rebecca tells the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme without Shanaz and Muhammad she ""wouldn't have anyone else to call family"". She has referred to them as ""mum and dad"" since the third month of living together. She has learned basic Urdu to become closer to them, and has travelled with the family to Pakistan - something that stirred opinions among school friends. One told her she was ""living with terrorists"", she says. Others have talked about her family having ""explosives"". Rebecca remembers being perplexed. ""I live in a family as anyone else would."" Shanaz is clear that fostering ""isn't about imposing religion"" Shanaz says she has also been hurt by comments. ""People think the girl will lose her identity. People question, 'Is she going to become one of you? Is she going to have an arranged marriage?' ""We are trying to give this child the best care in the world."" The family is also fostering an Afghan boy and Kenyan girl - and Shanaz is keen to explain that Rebecca has been able to maintain ""her own identity"". ""Rebecca is going to be Rebecca,"" she says. ""Fostering isn't about imposing religion. Foster carers are not there to remould them."" She says she has spoken about Islam with Rebecca but ""never imposed it"" on her. ""We celebrate every culture and religion in this household. We celebrate Christmas because it's a holiday and festival time."" The government says it does not have statistics on how many interracial placements there are. But it is estimated that 3,000 Muslim children are placed into foster care each year. Krish Kandiah, a Christian theologian, has fostered children from a broad range of religious and cultural backgrounds. ""Reading the Bible, it has so much to say about vulnerable kids in our society,"" he says, explaining his choice to foster. Christian Krish Kandiah says he has made a Koran available to Muslim children in his care He dismisses the idea that having Christianity as a key motivator for becoming a foster parent is in conflict with the role, which requires children's religious choices to be respected. ""When Muslim kids have come into my care I have asked how we can help, how we should honour that. ""We've had Halal meat, made a Koran available. If my kid was in care, I'd want their faith to be respected."" He says that there have been instances where people are ""very critical"" of foster carers. But, he adds, ""I'd tell critics to step up and foster themselves"". Jerome says his former foster parents did not take his identity into account Not all placements are a success. Jerome Harvey, who's 26, said his identity was overlooked by a Muslim family he lived with at the age of four. ""The first family I lived with were Indian Muslim, and it was just a massive culture shock,"" he says. ""The first thing that stood out to me was the food. We didn't recognise it, [but] they forced us to eat it. ""They lost us,"" he adds. ""A carer's job is to find you, but they lost us because they weren't interested in who we were before we got there. ""We didn't celebrate Christmas."" He says the family did not introduce him to their culture either. ""If anything they damaged us further. They excluded us from who they were. ""We'd watch them pray but not really understand why they were doing it, or what it is, and just copy."" Kevin Williams, chief executive of the charity Fostering Network, says over the last 20 years there has been much greater understanding of the need to support a foster child's ""culture and beliefs"". Foster parents are trained to ensure they are prepared to look after children of all backgrounds, he adds, with social workers acting as a safeguard. Mr Williams is clear that foster parents should ""not be forcing a religion onto a child"", but that - if they are religious - they can talk to the child about this, as it is important for them to be made aware of ""different experiences"". The charity estimates that there is currently a shortage of 8,000 foster carers across the UK. ""We want children to be matched as closely as possible with a family - including religious and cultural needs - but this is not always possible,"" Mr Williams explains. He hopes more Muslim families will want to foster in future so that they can care for children of all beliefs. Rebecca asks people not to take a negative view of Muslim foster parents. ""Don't judge a book by its cover. You can't believe everything that's on the news, or what's been said about Islam,"" she says.

"At the last election, the Conservative Party promised to plant millions of trees. But, as Reality Check correspondent Chris Morris reports, it is going to have to dramatically speed up the planting to meet the target. Campaigners have called on the government to do more to address the ""unacceptably low"" level of woodland cover in the United Kingdom, arguing it is causing the country both economic and environmental damage. Only 13% of the UK's total land area is covered in trees, compared with an average elsewhere in the EU of about 35%. In England, the figure is just 10%, and efforts to plant more trees have been falling short. A statement from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) says: ""Planting more trees is at the heart of our work to protect the environment for future generations."" But critics say the government is not doing enough. On the Bromborough estate in Northamptonshire, four hectares (10 acres) of new woodland were planted two years ago. It's a mix of fast-growing species such as grey alder, coniferous trees such as larch and Douglas fir, and species such as sycamore and oak that will take more than a century to reach maturity. ""It provides us with different products,"" says Justin Mumford, from the forestry consultants Lockhart Garrett. ""But it also creates a resilient woodland, a robust woodland."" The trouble is, across the country, there isn't enough of it. Tree planting is a devolved issue, so there are different policies in place across the United Kingdom. But Stuart Goodall, the chief executive of Confor - which represents the forestry and sawmilling sector across the UK - says all of them are ""failing miserably."" ""There's a big need to plant trees both to provide a future supply of wood for the sawmilling industry in 20 years' time,"" he says, ""but also to hit our climate change targets - we need to lock up carbon."" ""So we're failing on both those counts."" Between 2010 and 2015, there were 11 million trees planted as part of government schemes in England. The2015 Conservative Party manifesto,externalpromised to plant another 11 million trees over the next five years, but planting was well behind schedule when the snap election was called earlier this year. In 2015-16, 642,000 trees were planted in England. In 2016-17, it was 802,000. The 2017 Tory manifesto repeated the pledge of 11 million, and added that another one million trees would be planted in towns and cities. There is some catching up to do. Elsewhere in the UK, the picture is mixed. Forest and woodland currently cover about 18% of Scotland, and the Scottish government intends to increase that to 21% by 2032. Its current target is to plant 10,000 hectares of new woodland every year, rising to 15,000 per year by 2024-25. The Welsh government promised in 2008 to plant a tree for every child born or adopted in Wales, and in 2014 it extended that to plant another tree in Uganda for every child. This year, it plans to restock government-owned woodland with five million trees. So both Scotland and Wales appear to be planting faster than England. But the overall lack of tree cover means the UK has now become the second largest net importer of timber in the world, after China. ""We buy a lot of timber in from France,"" says David Kinns, who owns a family-run sawmill and timber merchants near Milton Keynes, ""in fact [our timber comes from] all over the world."" He too, is unimpressed with government targets. ""Eleven million isn't many trees. They'll take a long while to grow, and they won't all come to fruition."" The other problem with the Conservative manifesto commitment is it is almost impossible to say what 11 million trees means in terms of land area, because they can be planted at a density of anything between 1,000 and 2,500 per hectare. Secondly, the government's five-year target is not a net figure, so it doesn't take account of the number of trees being cut down. Conservation charity the Woodland Trust says it is extremely difficult to get an accurate figure for the number of trees being felled in England every year. But it believes that England may have reached, or be on the cusp of, deforestation - cutting down more trees than it plants. It puts the government's long-term ambition - of increasing woodland cover to 12% of land area in England by 2060 - into sobering perspective. Meeting that target would require at least 5,000 hectares of tree cover to be added every year. In the past few years, planting levels have been far below that. Even the 12% figure is considerably lower than a recommendation made in 2012 by theIndependent Panel on Forestry,external, which said the government should be aiming for 15% woodland cover by 2060. In other words, tree planting in England is falling well behind a target many experts believe was insufficient in the first place. So can anything be done? Defra says it is committed to working with landowners to grow woodland cover. It highlights a new Â£19m Woodland Carbon Fund to encourage large-scale planting. And it argues it has made it easier to apply for schemes such as the Countryside Stewardship Woodland Creation grant, which offers up to Â£6,800 per hectare to plant, weed and protect trees. But again, some experts beg to differ. There may be an increasing number of farmers who want to see trees forming part of their farming systems, but it has to be worth their while. ""There are all sorts of reasons at the moment why you wouldn't want to plant trees,"" says Beccy Speight, the chief executive of the Woodland Trust, ""and there's not a huge amount to incentivise you to do so."" ""As a farmer you can lose some of your basic farm payment if you have tree cover. So that's a problem."" The Woodland Trust also says the grant schemes that exist are still too complex and the timescale around applications is too tight. A post-Brexit replacement for current schemes under the Common Agricultural Policy could provide one opportunity to change the way grants for farmers link up with trees and woods. But, realistically, tree planting is unlikely to emerge as a top priority in what will be a complex negotiation. Tree cover in the UK has increased considerably over the past century, after it reached a historic low at the end of World War One. But the UK is still far behind comparable developed economies around the world. And last year the rate of planting in England fell to its lowest level in more than 40 years.

"This video can not be played Students with Catalan flags chanted ""independence"" Backers and opponents of independence in Catalonia have clashed in parliament over the way forward as the Spanish government is set to reassert control. The debate began after Catalan President Carles Puigdemont did not reveal a favoured course of action, and called on MPs to decide on a response. On Friday Spain's Senate is expected to curtail the region's autonomous powers. The move follows Catalonia's independence referendum, which Spain's Constitutional Court declared illegal. Mr Puigdemont declared independence after the 1 October vote. But he immediately suspended implementation, calling for talks. The Catalan government said that of the 43% who took part in the referendum, 90% were in favour of independence. Carles Puigdemont (right) has been under pressure not to call a snap election Many people gathered in Barcelona on Thursday hoping Mr Puigdemont would declare independence. But there has also been speculation that he might call regional elections in an effort to avoid rule from Madrid. However Mr Puigdemont did neither. ""I have been prepared to call elections, as long as guarantees are given,"" he said. He added that Spain's governing Popular Party had not given such assurances - without giving any details.

""We will continue on the path to a Catalan republic,"" an MP for the far-left CUP, which provides key support for the pro-independence governing coalition. This video can not be played A Catalan government representative and a Spanish government minister fail to see eye to eye in a BBC interview But  Ines Arrimadas, leader of the anti-independence Citizens's party, accused Mr Puigdemont of missing countless opportunities to resolve the crisis through negotiation. ""You still have time to return to legality and call elections,"" she said. Analysis by James Reynolds, BBC News, Barcelona Spain's profound constitutional crisis in four decades of democracy is currently working its way through two competing parliaments. The country's Senate in Madrid is getting ready to approve emergency powers for the central government. Pro-independence members of the Catalan regional parliament believe that they must do something to counter any moves made in Madrid. Some parliamentarians want to go ahead and make an unequivocal unilateral declaration of Catalan independence. Pro-independence campaign groups have called for demonstrations outside the parliament building in the morning. Reacting to Mr Puigdemont's statement on Thursday, Spanish Deputy Prime Minister Soraya Saenz de Santamaria defended her government's handling of the crisis. She said the Spanish model was ""one of the most decentralised in the world"". She added: ""We've always shown our sincere desire to collaborate. The pro-independence camp have made it clear they don't want dialogue."" The parliamentary session in Barcelona is now suspended, and will resume on Friday morning. It is expected to vote on whether to declare unilateral independence or not. Also on Friday the Senate is due to hold a vote on the government's plan to trigger Article 155 of the Spanish constitution. Under the proposals announced by Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy this week, Mr Puigdemont would be removed and new regional elections held. Madrid would take control of Catalonia's finances, police and public media. Mr Rajoy's centre-right government has a majority in the Senate. The plan has also been approved by opposition parties.

"At the last election, the Conservative Party promised to plant millions of trees. But, as Reality Check correspondent Chris Morris reports, it is going to have to dramatically speed up the planting to meet the target. Campaigners have called on the government to do more to address the ""unacceptably low"" level of woodland cover in the United Kingdom, arguing it is causing the country both economic and environmental damage. Only 13% of the UK's total land area is covered in trees, compared with an average elsewhere in the EU of about 35%. In England, the figure is just 10%, and efforts to plant more trees have been falling short. A statement from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) says: ""Planting more trees is at the heart of our work to protect the environment for future generations."" But critics say the government is not doing enough. On the Bromborough estate in Northamptonshire, four hectares (10 acres) of new woodland were planted two years ago. It's a mix of fast-growing species such as grey alder, coniferous trees such as larch and Douglas fir, and species such as sycamore and oak that will take more than a century to reach maturity. ""It provides us with different products,"" says Justin Mumford, from the forestry consultants Lockhart Garrett. ""But it also creates a resilient woodland, a robust woodland."" The trouble is, across the country, there isn't enough of it. Tree planting is a devolved issue, so there are different policies in place across the United Kingdom. But Stuart Goodall, the chief executive of Confor - which represents the forestry and sawmilling sector across the UK - says all of them are ""failing miserably."" ""There's a big need to plant trees both to provide a future supply of wood for the sawmilling industry in 20 years' time,"" he says, ""but also to hit our climate change targets - we need to lock up carbon."" ""So we're failing on both those counts."" Between 2010 and 2015, there were 11 million trees planted as part of government schemes in England. The2015 Conservative Party manifesto,externalpromised to plant another 11 million trees over the next five years, but planting was well behind schedule when the snap election was called earlier this year. In 2015-16, 642,000 trees were planted in England. In 2016-17, it was 802,000. The 2017 Tory manifesto repeated the pledge of 11 million, and added that another one million trees would be planted in towns and cities. There is some catching up to do. Elsewhere in the UK, the picture is mixed. Forest and woodland currently cover about 18% of Scotland, and the Scottish government intends to increase that to 21% by 2032. Its current target is to plant 10,000 hectares of new woodland every year, rising to 15,000 per year by 2024-25. The Welsh government promised in 2008 to plant a tree for every child born or adopted in Wales, and in 2014 it extended that to plant another tree in Uganda for every child. This year, it plans to restock government-owned woodland with five million trees. So both Scotland and Wales appear to be planting faster than England. But the overall lack of tree cover means the UK has now become the second largest net importer of timber in the world, after China. ""We buy a lot of timber in from France,"" says David Kinns, who owns a family-run sawmill and timber merchants near Milton Keynes, ""in fact [our timber comes from] all over the world."" He too, is unimpressed with government targets. ""Eleven million isn't many trees. They'll take a long while to grow, and they won't all come to fruition."" The other problem with the Conservative manifesto commitment is it is almost impossible to say what 11 million trees means in terms of land area, because they can be planted at a density of anything between 1,000 and 2,500 per hectare. Secondly, the government's five-year target is not a net figure, so it doesn't take account of the number of trees being cut down. Conservation charity the Woodland Trust says it is extremely difficult to get an accurate figure for the number of trees being felled in England every year. But it believes that England may have reached, or be on the cusp of, deforestation - cutting down more trees than it plants. It puts the government's long-term ambition - of increasing woodland cover to 12% of land area in England by 2060 - into sobering perspective. Meeting that target would require at least 5,000 hectares of tree cover to be added every year. In the past few years, planting levels have been far below that. Even the 12% figure is considerably lower than a recommendation made in 2012 by theIndependent Panel on Forestry,external, which said the government should be aiming for 15% woodland cover by 2060. In other words, tree planting in England is falling well behind a target many experts believe was insufficient in the first place. So can anything be done? Defra says it is committed to working with landowners to grow woodland cover. It highlights a new Â£19m Woodland Carbon Fund to encourage large-scale planting. And it argues it has made it easier to apply for schemes such as the Countryside Stewardship Woodland Creation grant, which offers up to Â£6,800 per hectare to plant, weed and protect trees. But again, some experts beg to differ. There may be an increasing number of farmers who want to see trees forming part of their farming systems, but it has to be worth their while. ""There are all sorts of reasons at the moment why you wouldn't want to plant trees,"" says Beccy Speight, the chief executive of the Woodland Trust, ""and there's not a huge amount to incentivise you to do so."" ""As a farmer you can lose some of your basic farm payment if you have tree cover. So that's a problem."" The Woodland Trust also says the grant schemes that exist are still too complex and the timescale around applications is too tight. A post-Brexit replacement for current schemes under the Common Agricultural Policy could provide one opportunity to change the way grants for farmers link up with trees and woods. But, realistically, tree planting is unlikely to emerge as a top priority in what will be a complex negotiation. Tree cover in the UK has increased considerably over the past century, after it reached a historic low at the end of World War One. But the UK is still far behind comparable developed economies around the world. And last year the rate of planting in England fell to its lowest level in more than 40 years.

"The UK's population is set to exceed 70 million before the end of the next decade, according to the Office for National Statistics. The UK population was estimated to stand at 65.6 million in 2016. TheONS projections,externalare now for a 3.6 million, or 5.5%, increase over the 10 years to 2026, with the 70m mark being passed in the middle of 2029. This is two years later than the ONS's 2014 projection that the UK population would pass the 70m barrier in mid-2027. The reason for the change is that since the 2014 study the assumption of net migration of 185,000 a year has been cut to 165,000 a year, while the expected number of children per woman has been cut from 1.89 to 1.84 - with growth in life expectancy trimmed for men from 84.3 to 83.4 and for women from 87.1 to 86.2. Scots population 'to grow and age' 2016 saw biggest UK population rise for 70 years BBC history: Animation of UK population from the Iron Age onwards Andrew Nash, of the ONS Population Projections Unit, said: ""Over that period 54% of growth is projected to result directly from net international migration. The other 46% is because there will be more births than deaths."" Over the decade from mid-2016 projected growth in England's population is put at 5.9%, for Northern Ireland the figure is 4.2% while for Scotland and Wales the percentages are 3.2% and 3.1% respectively. The figures, which do not take into account any Brexit impact, puts projected UK population growth between 2015 and 2040 at 16%, compared with 10% growth for France and 4% for Germany, while Italy's population is projected to see a slight decline. The study also says that the numbers of people aged 85 and over with have doubled to from 1.6m in 2016 to 3.2m in 2041. The Brexit vote has made calculating the growth of the UK's population much more difficult.  The level of net migration and, indeed, the potential emigration of young, fertile residents are dependent on the kind of post-Brexit agreement that emerges. Nevertheless, the Office for National Statistics has had a stab at it and concluded that the UK population will not grow as fast as previously thought. In 25 years' time, it believes there will be close to 73m people in the UK - some 2m fewer than they had thought before the EU referendum. Net migration will be lower and so will the fertility rate with fewer young foreign-born women coming to live in the UK. They also expect a slower rate of increased life expectancy than previously assumed. The impact of Brexit is dependent on the kind of deal that emerges and what happens to the UK economy as a result.  Those factors will affect the numbers who wish to come and wish to leave. The ONS thinks, annually over the next 25 years, net migration will fall by about 20,000 compared with previous forecasts.  But the uncertain nature of our politics makes these kind of projections fraught - particularly for those who use the data to make decisions about building roads and houses and transport infrastructure.

"Southend Hospital has distanced itself from a pilot scheme were hospital patients could be discharged to recuperate in people's spare rooms A hospital has backed down over plans for patients to recuperate in people's homes as part of an Airbnb-style trial. Southend Hospital in Essex said it has ""no intention... to support the pilot at this time"". The trial by healthcare start-up CareRooms involves 30 hospital patients staying in local residents' spare rooms while waiting to be discharged. It had been criticised by politicians and health groups as a ""ridiculous"" idea. Labour's Shadow Health Minister Justin Madders said the scheme would be a ""sticking plaster"" for wider issues in the care sector. The hospital had previously said ""only preliminary discussions"" had been held, but has since clarified the pilot would not be supported until certain criteria had been met. Deputy chief executive of Southend University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, Tom Abell, said: ""While we welcome and encourage new ideas and innovation, there is no intention and there never has been for the hospital to support this pilot at this time. ""We will never compromise the safety and quality of care for patients and we will not support this pilot until the necessary safeguarding and quality arrangements are in place and there has been full engagement and discussion with our local communities on the proposal."" Earlier, CareRooms said it would recruit ""hosts"" whose properties had spare rooms or annexes with a private bathroom to create ""secure care spaces for patients who are waiting to be discharged"". The hosts - who would earn up to a maximum of Â£1,000 per month - would not need any previous care experience but would need to go through security checks to be approved for the scheme.

"BT will slash costs for customers who only have a landline, after a review by regulator Ofcom. From April 2018, the telecoms company will reduce the price of its monthly line rental by Â£7, a 37% decrease from the current cost of Â£18.99. The reduction will save up to a million households Â£84 a year, and customers will have their rental costs capped at the rate of inflation. Ofcom expects three other providers to follow suit. Nearly two-thirds of BT customers with only a landline are over 65 and more than three-quarters have never switched provider, the regulator said. Ofcom said they had been getting poor value for money in recent years, compared to those who buy bundles of landline, broadband and/or pay-TV services. BT said it welcomed ""a balanced voluntary agreement with Ofcom"" and that it had ""listened to the concerns of our line-only customers"". Two other providers have increased their rental charges by even more than BT. According to Ofcom, both Sky and Virgin Media have put up their charges by 47% above the rate of inflation since 2009. At the same time the wholesale cost of providing the service has actually fallen by 27% in real terms. ""For many people, their landline is their lifeline,"" said Jonathan Oxley, Ofcom's competition group director. ""But households who only have a landline - and no broadband - have seen their phone bills soar. Many are elderly and have been with BT for decades. We've been clear that they must get a better deal."" The other firms that provide landline-only deals, Virgin Media, Sky and the Post Office, have not yet commentated on whether they will reduce their charges. However Virgin Media said it had already frozen rental charges for elderly and disabled customers at Â£17.99 a month. The Post Office said it would look again at the issue. Talk Talk withdrew from that part of the market, to concentrate on broadband and phone bundles. Age UK said it was disappointed that BT had to be prompted to cut charges by the regulator. ""We welcome the reduced tariffs, but we do find it disappointing that it has taken the intervention from Ofcom for this to happen,"" said Caroline Abrahams, charity director at Age UK. Ofcom also said it wanted to help those who buy a phone service from one provider and broadband from another.

"A woman who bought a combat knife and training dummy for her husband has been found guilty of helping him prepare for a planned terror attack in Birmingham. Madihah Taheer, 21, from the city, denied preparing an act of terrorism by assisting her husband Ummariyat Mirza earlier this year. Woolwich Crown Court heard the husband and wife team had developed their plans after falling in love as teenagers. She has been remanded in custody and will be sentenced at a later date. In March, armed police arrested the husband at gunpoint in Birmingham. The couple who put IS at the heart of their marriage They acted on MI5 intelligence that Mirza was going to carry out a rampaging knife attack, similar to those seen this year in London. His arrest on 29 March came exactly one week after theWestminster Bridge terror attackin London. The court was told the pair had initially hoped to travel to Syria to aid the Islamic State group - but decided to carry out an attack in their home city instead. West Midlands counter-terror officers said they discovered a list of potential targets, including military sites in the area. Taheer also allowed her debit card to be used to buy a plastic knife and a lifelike training dummy so that her husband could practise an attack, the court heard. The dummy was found in their home with slash marks on the forehead, across the throat and abdomen. The court was shown the dummy Mirza made his wife buy, usually sold for use in martial arts The jury at Woolwich Crown Court took less than a day to convict Taheer. The jurors were shown a text message that Taheer sent to Mirza in September 2015, before the couple were married. ""Can we get married already,"" she wrote. ""I want u to kill ppl for me. I have a list."" The court was shown another message she sent to Mirza a month later, where Taheer said it was her ""dream"" to hurt or kill a person the pair both knew. He responded by sending her a video of him making stabbing motions towards a chair - and asking her to buy him a knife. Mirza made Taheer return the first dummy she purchased as it was not the model he wanted Mirza, a former accountant, pleaded guilty to the plotting charge earlier this month, and is also due to be sentenced. His older sister, Zainub Mirza, pleaded guilty in October to sending him terrorist material, including a video showing an IS hostage being beheaded. Sue Hemming, of the Crown Prosecution Service, said the messages showed Taheer was a ""willing accomplice"" who knew what the knife would be used for. She said: ""This couple posed a serious threat to the public in Britain and now face the prospect of time in prison where they will no longer be a danger.""

"Madihah Taheer: Convicted of preparing an act of terrorism Three members of the same family have been convictedfor being part of what could have been a major terror attack on the streets of Birmingham. Prosecutors say that at the centre of the plot foiled earlier this year were a husband-and-wife team who put the self-styled Islamic State's cause at the centre of their marriage. At the top of 21-year-old Madihah Taheer's Facebook profile is a painting depicting what appears to be a Muslim warrior from antiquity, galloping away from battle with a maiden clinging tightly to him. She gazes lovingly into his eyes. She is in the arms of her conquering hero. That was the life for the failed A-Level student from Birmingham. She dreamt of escaping her cannabis-smoking dad who had tried to marry her off to her first cousin. The romantic vision Madihah Taheer sought And she thought she had found her hero in Ummariyat Mirza. A life as heroes in Syria. Except the dream ended in squabbles over whether to spend money on weapons or baby clothes  - and her husband wrestled to the floor by armed police. Ummariyat Mirza, also known as Ummar, and his sister Zainub were arrested on 29 March as they drove through Alum Rock in east Birmingham. Plain clothes officers had covertly followed them in a joint operation by MI5 and the West Midlands Counter Terrorism Unit. Ummar Mirza: Pleaded guilty Just a week after the Westminster Bridge attack, intelligence indicated Mirza was planning some kind of similar knife-led rampage in his home city. Earlier this month he admitted preparing an act of terrorism. Prosecutors said that Mirza had: Bought a knife after teaching himself the best way to kill someone on a martial arts dummy at home Devised a way to conceal the weapon with cord turned into a harness over his shoulder Researched potential targets including the city's RAF careers office and Birmingham's central synagogue Martial arts dummy: Used by Mirza to train Days later, as the trial of Mirza's sister approached, Zainub Mirza admitted encouraging him by sharing extremist videos that cemented his mindset. The wife, Madihah Taheer, denied being involved. But today, a jury at Woolwich Crown Court found she was also guilty of preparing an act of terrorism by buying the knife her husband would use - and knowing what he would use it for. Over the course of her trial, Taheer denied that allegation - but the jury at Woolwich Crown Court heard that her relationship with her husband, which began as a teenager's obsessive love, was at the heart of their plots, schemes, plans and fantasies. Taheer was 17 and at sixth form when she met her future husband. It was a secret love. She said she wanted to escape her family and charismatic Mirza said he was going places. In their bedrooms, via mobile phones and iPads, they played out their dreams. He would be the big hero mujahideen fighter giving it to President Assad in Syria and any other Kuffar, the unbelievers. She was the jihadi-bride to-be, inspired by an infamous blog, written by another young woman who had married a fighter in Syria. ""OMG man she made me want it so bad,"" she messaged to her secret boyfriend. ""She's honest and it's beautiful man. Just raw and proper life."" In Whatsapp chats, Mirza described himself to his love as a ""terrorist who doesn't wanna live that long"" and they agreed they should aim to reach Syria within a year of marriage. But Taheer wanted her husband-to-be to first take care of a few local people who had challenged her thinking. ""Can we get married already ffs?,"" said Taheer in late 2015. ""I want you to kill people for me I have a list."" ""The day of niqqah [the marriage] I will kill them all, give me the list,"" replied Mirza. ""You can't have it until you put a ring on it,"" she said. They squabbled over who was the most radical and they laughed at videos of IS killings, hostage beheadings and terrorism attacks. ""I hope our babies look like you. Your [sic] perfect,"" messaged Taheer one day. ""Do you want a boy or girl first?"" ""Boy cuz I want a male best best jihadi friend I don't have none :( so when I'm 40 I'll have a rest [sic] friend who is 20 and he'll be jihadi and funny and my bestest friend,"" he said. As their April 2016 wedding approached, their messages to each other showed Syria was fading into the background. Attacking at home loomed into view. ""You are a perfect partner and soulja and soulmate,"" wrote Mirza. ""What I have in mind is very sophisticated. I need a right hand."" His girlfriend replied: ""If we get married then u know I'm up for it."" Madihah Taheer with her partner's air rifle Throughout her evidence, Taheer said this talk was just a joke. A sick joke that she was now ashamed of, but it had been ""their humour"". She said she had been brainwashed into following IS by a charming but increasingly manipulative young man. ""I was just turned 17 and he was still 16,"" she told the court. ""He was a difficult person to be in a relationship with, very controlling, very jealous and it became clear to me quite early in the relationship that he suffered from depression."" Taheer said her future husband's helplessness and search for answers alighted on IS. ""Talking about Islamic State gave him a distraction,"" she told the jury. ""I was sucked into it as well. In hindsight I see that he was egging me on. I do not have those beliefs now. I was completely wrong, immature and stupid."" Taheer told the jury that she began using ploys to humour her husband rather than challenge him. One, she said, had been to delay a departure date for Syria because her eyesight was poor. ""Ummar, I'm not making Hijrah [moving to Syria] without getting the laser [eye surgery] done first,"" she said. ""You shut up,"" he replied. They have the facilities there ok."" ""Imagine if we're on the run and my glasses break. We're f*ed. I don't wanna be reliant on something to help me see."" Following their April 2016 wedding, Taheer said the reality of working for a living as a nursery administrator and her subsequent pregnancy dispelled her fantasies. She said she woke up to IS heroes. ""When you are brainwashed into something, it takes a long time to get out of it,"" she told the jury. ""I came out of my bubble and began to see the world for what it really was. ""Love is blind. I did not realise that I was under that kind of manipulation."" The case against Mirza, to which he pleaded guilty, was that his plans crystallised early in 2017. His obsessive character - which involved nagging his wife to buy him ""toys"", turned to asking her to buy him a Â£300 combat knife. Arrest: Filmed by witnesses The prosecution's case was that given their history, Taheer knew what her husband was planning. Her only concern was the cost. ""It is too much money,"" she messaged him from work when he told her what he wanted to buy. ""Can't we wait until I get paid. Got bills to pay - baby things to buy. It doesn't have to be bloody state of the art."" Mirza persisted. ""This isn't a fantasy, it's real,"" he said. ""We are living like kuffar [disbelievers]."" Eventually, on 21 February, Taheer bought her husband a knife for Â£120 - the key evidence against her. The knife bought by Madihah Taheer And he had been training how to use it on a martial arts dummy at home. On 20 March, Mirza wrote the following to a family group chat: ""We should try to avoid making all of these big claims of what we can do and how we're going [sic] give victory to Islam. Just do it, don't talk about it.' A week after the Westminster attack, he posted a single picture to his Whatsapp account: an emoticon of a knife. It looked like a signal. The police moved in and his plans were smashed. Taheer said she had no idea that her husband genuinely intended to carry out an attack. But the jury did not believe her - and she was found guilty of a single act of preparing an act of terrorism. During one particularly stormy moment in Taheer and Mirza's relationship, she told him: ""I regret meeting you, talking to you, listening."" Once they are sentenced, she may have a very long time to think about that regret.

"Maxine Peake has written a new play but won't appear in the cast She's known for her acting on stage and screen, but Maxine Peake has another career - writing plays about fearless women who overcame the odds in a man's world. It took four policemen to physically hold Lillian Bilocca back when she tried to stop a trawler leaving port in Hull in 1968 at the height of her campaign for safety at sea. Three ships and 58 lives had just been lost and emotions were high. ""Big Lil"" was a fishwife, and her husband, father and son all worked on the trawlers. She had had enough. She tried to board under-manned ships to prevent them from departing and took a petition with 10,000 signatures to the government. For their efforts, she and her fellow ""headscarf revolutionaries"" were met with disdain, misogyny and even death threats by some Hull men and trawler owners. She was blacklisted and never worked in the fishing industry again. But the campaign worked. The law was changed, and lives were undoubtedly saved. Lillian Bilocca died in 1988 at the age of 59 Bilocca is the heroine of Maxine Peake's latest play The Last Testament of Lillian Bilocca, which opens in Hull next week. ""It felt an important story to tell,"" the actress and playwright says. ""It's about women putting their head above the parapet, and she did get punished for it by the community."" One of Britain's most sought-after performers, Peake has starred in TV dramas including Shameless, Silk and Three Girls, and films like The Theory of Everything. But she also has a burning desire to tell her own stories - mostly about unsung British heroines whose achievements have been swept under history's carpet. Before The Last Testament of Lillian Bilocca,she wrote Beryl, about Beryl Burton, the champion cyclist who went faster than her male rivals, as well as Queens of the Coal Age, about four miners' wives who tried to save pits from closure by occupying a mine. The Bolton-born actress and writer wants to celebrate ""ordinary women who had led extraordinary lives"", she explains. She says: ""There's a determination and a fearlessness in those women that I really gravitated towards. They were 'get up and go and sod the consequences'. ""I sort of aspire to [that]. They really spoke to me. They didn't let being a womanâ¦ obviously it was an issue, but they didn't feel it was something that ever stopped them or became a barrier. They knew what they wanted to do. ""With Beryl and with Lil, they had a passion and they followed it. I suppose that's what I've always tried to do, although it's not always easy."" Maxine Peake isn't keeping up with the Kardashians There are some ""amazing role models out there"" today, Peake says - but she believes Beryl, Lil and the rest set better examples than some celebrities who are held up as idols for young women. She's looking at you, the Kardashians. ""Look at our role models,"" she says. ""I won't mention her name, but there's a family, you know, and it's all about beauty and looks, and that drives me insane. ""For young women now it's about education. That's our weapon. If you want to fight, as they say, the pen is the sword."" The smartphone may not be the sword, though - especially if social media gets in the way of our path to personal freedom. Peake continues: ""It's about following your dream and being brave and - I know it's difficult - but we get very stilted by what other people think of us in this media age now. ""I feel in some respects lucky that it wasn't part of my generation. It feels like it's even more [about] the body beautiful and selfies and Twitter, and people getting held back by what other people think about them and opinions about them. ""You just want to say to girls and young women, 'You can. Think big. Even if you don't get to where you're going, you'll get somewhere along the ladder.'"" Prepare the Baftas: Maxine Peake in Three Girls Peake herself is near the top of the acting ladder, despite saying she's never taken the most obvious career opportunities. Her high-profile roles have been peppered with projects like a concept album about the Pendle Witch Trials, playing Hamlet on stage - and now writing a play about a Hull fishwife. ""Sometimes people go, 'Why are you doing that now? You had quite a good acting career there,'"" she says. ""But that's me. If the path's going one way, I have to jump off. ""If I feel like if there's a few too many people on that path with me then I want to jump off and find another one."" She's not the only person celebrating Lillian Bilocca's story, almost 50 years after her campaign and 30 years since her death from cancer at the age of 59. As well as Peake's play, which is being staged at Hull Guildhall in a production by Hull Truck theatre, a TV drama is in the works from Red Production Company, which made shows like Trust Me and Happy Valley. And by coincidence, another play is being staged in Hull at the same time as Peake's. Lil has been written by Hull playwright Val Holmes, who was 15 when Bilocca was fighting for better safety. Growing up, she recalls how Bilocca's name was ""often used with this lingering hate"". Men in the fishing industry often felt women shouldn't be interfering with their business, while the extra measures her campaign won - like full crews, radio operators for all ships, improved safety equipment and a ""mother ship"" with medical facilities for all fleets - were blamed for the economic decline of the industry, Holmes explains. ""The awareness is there now about what she actually achieved,"" the writer says. ""It's in the schools. But up to about 15 years ago, no. They forgot all about what she'd actually achieved and the fate of the fishing industry was laid at her door. ""I think people are just realising what she did actually achieve. The thousands of lives that were saved because of her and the other women's actions. ""I think they really do appreciate that now. And thank goodness."" The Last Testament of Lillian Bilocca is at Hull Guildhall from 3-18 November. Lil is at Jubilee Central, Hull, from 6-11 November.

"Nick Grimshaw has recorded the lowest listening figures for BBC Radio 1's breakfast show since records began. The DJ, who took over the slot from Chris Moyles in 2012, saw his audience drop below five million listeners per week in the third quarter of this year. The show recorded 4.93 million weekly listeners between July and September - down from 5.5 million last quarter. Controller Ben Cooper defended the stats and said it was still ""the most relevant youth brand in the UK today"". Why is Radio 1 struggling to find new DJs? BBC One reveals new primetime music show He also said there was still a 10.5 million weekly listenership across the station and that Radio 1 had 9.4 million subscribers on social media, with an additional five million on YouTube. Listening figures for all stations are traditionally lower in the summer months - but Grimshaw's figures are the lowest for any Radio 1 breakfast show since audience research body Rajar began collecting data. A.Dot helped 1Xtra reach its highest ever breakfast show audience A source at Radio 1 said: ""Grimmy is the number one breakfast show in the UK for young audiences and that's all they really care about. ""Teens are addicted to their phones so you can see why Radio 1 does so well on YouTube and Facebook."" There was better news for Radio 1's sister station - with A.Dot giving BBC Radio 1Xtra its highest ever audience for its breakfast show. It recorded 390,000 listeners in the last quarter - up 33,000 on the previous three months. People aged between 15-24 listened to just over 14 hours of radio per week last year - seven hours less than the average adult, and 15% less than they did a decade earlier, according to broadcasting regulator Ofcom. Roman Kemp took over from Dave Berry on Capital's breakfast show earlier this year Roman Kemp's Capital London breakfast show increased its audience - posting 1.11 million in the third quarter. The results were up by nearly 30,000 on the previous three months - it was the first full quarter he's presented the show, after becoming host in May this year. Chris Moyles's Radio X breakfast show has also grown its listenership, pulling in almost 75,000 more listeners across the same period, giving it a new weekly reach of 823,000.

"This video can not be played James Tringham, who has bipolar disorder, explains that being at work has a ""normalising effect"" Hayley Smith says her manager encouraged her to apply for other jobs when she told her she had depression. The news about her illness spread across the office. ""It was horrible - I felt really exposed,"" she says. After a few anxious, unhappy months, she left. Hayley is one of up to 300,000 people with mental health problems who leave their jobs each year, a report says. The report by mental health experts also says poor mental health costs the UK economy up to Â£99bn each year. Paul Farmer, co-author ofthe Thriving At Work report,external, said mental health was a taboo subject in many workplaces. Can you talk about mental health at work? The illness that affects one in six of us Mental health staff on stress leave up 22% Mr Farmer, who is chief executive of mental health charity Mind, said: ""Opportunities are missed to prevent poor mental health and ensure that employees who may be struggling get the support they need. ""In many instances, employers simply don't understand the crucial role they can play, or know where to go for advice and support."" The review makes 40 recommendations for how to support employees to remain at work, including creating an online wellbeing portal and using digital technology to support workers in the gig economy. Companies are also being encouraged to include a section on employee mental health in their annual reports. Currently only 11% of companies do this, the report said. Prime Minister Theresa May, who commissioned the report, said it showed ""we need to take action"". The civil service has agreed to take on the report's recommendations. Hayley Smith lost her job when she told her employer about her depression One employer the report praised is the insurer, Aviva. James Tringham, who has worked for the company for seven years, said it helped him get his life back on track after suffering with bipolar disorder. ""In 2009, I'd reached crisis point with my mental health, and I gave up my career as a solicitor,"" he says. ""I was unable to work for over a year - the prospect of returning to work was just so frightening and not something that I could imagine."" Eventually he got a job in the insurer's contact centre. ""They gave me a way back into employment and I have worked my way back up. ""Aviva have been brilliant in supporting me to manage my mental health at work, and have given me my confidence back. ""There's an understanding, which means little things like adjusting my workload when I'm feeling on the low side can really help. And the staff - both officially and unofficially - form a great support network."" Footballer Aaron Lennon returned to training after receiving mental health support Create a mental health at work plan Build mental health awareness by making information and support accessible Encourage open conversations Provide good working conditions and ensure employees have a healthy work-life balance Promote effective people management, with line managers holding regular conversations about health and well-being with their staff Routinely monitor employee mental health The review said that people with long-term mental health problems were leaving jobs at twice the rate of colleagues with no such issues, although it did say that some people may be counted twice - if they left one job, returned to work elsewhere after a break but were then unable to continue in their new post. The report also pointed out the cost to employers, estimating they were losing Â£42bn each year because of staff suffering from mental health problems. Mrs May said: ""It is only by making this an everyday concern for everyone that we change the way we see mental illness, so that striving to improve your mental health - whether at work or at home - is seen as just as positive as improving our physical well-being."" What is mental health? For Hayley Smith, support from her employer could have made her chronic depression more bearable. After leaving her job, she started her own company. Five years on, she now employs others. ""In the long term, it's given me awareness of mental health,"" she says. ""And the awareness to make sure I was never going to make people feel the way I was made to feel."" The illness that affects one in six of us Can you talk about mental health at work?

"The new measures apply to all commercial flights into the US New security measures affecting flights into the US are coming into effect, which US authorities say are aimed at reducing the threat of hidden explosives. They include enhanced screening of passengers and electronic devices. About 2,000 commercial flights a day from more than 100 countries will be affected. Some airline officials have expressed concern that the checks could cause delays and lead to higher prices. The measures apply to all commercial flights into the US, theDepartment of Homeland Security says,external. They replace a ban on laptops in airline cabin baggage from eight predominantly-Muslim countries which the US government announced in March but later dropped. Emails show UK alarm over US travel ban The ban was prompted by fears that terrorists could hide a bomb inside a laptop computer. The new measures could include short security interviews with passengers at check-in or the boarding gate, airlines say. Hong Kong-based airline Cathay Pacific said it would suspend its city check in and self bag-drop services and advised travellers to arrive at the airport three hours before departure. Singapore Airlines said personal electronic devices could be inspected. The US is currentlyenforcing a travel banon some people from eight countries - Iran, Libya, Syria, Yemen, Somalia, North Korea, Venezuela and Chad. However Sudan has been removed from the ban.

"This video can not be played Xie Yanyi: 'I didn't see sunlight for six months' For Xie Yanyi it was not the physical abuse that was the hardest to endure - although his list of the deliberate cruelties inflicted upon him is long. He was kept in a stress position, crouched on a low stool, from 06:00 in the morning until 22:00 at night. After 15 days like this, he tells me, his legs went numb and he had difficulty urinating. At times he was denied food and was subjected to gruelling interrogations for ""dozens of hours"" on end. He was beaten. And he was watched while he slept, with his guards insisting that he kept the same sleeping position all night. But harder to bear than all of this, Mr Xie insists, was the time spent in solitary confinement. ""I was kept alone in a small room and saw no daylight for half a year. I had nothing to read, nothing to do but to sit on that low stool."" ""People could go mad in that situation. I was isolated from the world. This is torture - the isolation is more painful than being beaten."" Although impossible to verify, his account tallies with other reports of the suffering endured under the so-called ""war on law"", launched during the Chinese Leader Xi Jinping's first five years in office. Only in Mr Xie's case it is a rare, first-hand account. President Xi has tightened the government's grip on dissenters Like theother lawyersinvolved, Mr Xie was, upon his release, warned not to speak to the foreign media but it is a prohibition he has chosen to ignore. ""It might be risky to do this interview,"" he tells me. ""But I feel it's my responsibility to speak out. I have no choice. I can't accept a society that arrests people for what they think and what they say."" The crackdown on China's already beleaguered human rights field began in mid 2015, halfway through Xi Jinping's first term. Now, anointed in office for a second term by the Communist Party Congress that ended this week, it stands as one of his most gloomy legacies. In total, more than 300 lawyers, legal assistants and activists have been brought in for questioning, with more than two dozen pursued as formal investigations. Two years on, some have been givenlong jail terms, others stillawait sentenceand at least one appears to havedisappeared completely. Lawyer Wang Quanzhang hasn't been seen or heard from since 2015 Xie Yanyi, like the others targeted by the campaign, has spent much of his legal career representing clients involved in sensitive cases - victims of official corruption, police violence or religious persecution - and harassment andabuse,externalhave always been part of the job. He was also a bold advocate for peaceful democratic reform, once having filed a lawsuit against the former Chinese Leader Jiang Zemin for refusing to step down from the Central Military Commission at the end of his presidency. But it is under China's current president that things have taken a dramatic turn for the worse. Shortly after Xi Jinping came to power, at the last Communist Party Congress in 2012, aleaked document,externalbegan circulating online that outlined seven key ideological concepts that posed a threat to Communist Party rule and forbade the promotion of them in China's universities or in the media. Issued by an office close to the senior Communist Party leadership, the list of forbidden ideologies included ""Western constitutional democracy"", ""universal values"" and ""civil society"". In hindsight, the document now appears to have set the tone for much of what has followed. Mr Xi has presided over anarrowing of the room for public discussion,external, tightercontrol over the media, newrestrictions on foreign organisations and charities,external, aclampdown on the internet, and of course, the campaign against the human rights lawyers. How Chinese authorities censor your thoughts Human cost of China's economic reforms China congress: The communist slogans praising Xi Jinping It was never meant to be this way. For decades, the mantra in the West was that ever increasing trade with China would bring political reform in its wake. ""Economic freedom creates the habits of liberty,"" former US President George W Bush once said in a speech on the subject of engagement with China. And there was a time when that promise appeared to be bearing fruit. Ahead of the 2007 Party Congress, the meeting at which Xi Jinping first emerged as a likely future leader, state media were openly, if tentatively,discussing incremental political change.,external In 2017, political change is off the agenda Even around the 2012 Congress - by which time any glimpses of optimism had already begun fading -open letters and petitionswere being published calling for democratic reform in the shape of an independent judiciary and a bill of rights. It would be a brave academic, journalist or lawyer who would put their signature to such a manifesto today. Chinese state run media has dismissed at least one of the accounts of the torture of the human rights lawyers as""fake news"",externaland has accused the foreign media, in its coverage of such cases, as being""great enthusiasts"" for negative stories,external. But evenforeign observers,externalcan find themselves dazzled by China's skyscrapers, high-speed railways and its rising middle class millions. The plight of a few lawyers and activists can seem to be a diversion from what really matters. But Xie Yanyi's account of torture, and others like it, ought to tell us something very important. As China grows in power, influence and confidence, it is determined to do so without any of the political freedoms that conventional wisdom had once thought of as a prerequisite to becoming a world leading, prosperous economy. The message sent to 1.4 billion citizens has been clear: think very carefully before daring to challenge the authority of the Communist Party, even in the country's own, Communist Party-run courts. China congress: Why Beijing has banned hot air balloons Xi Jinping - The president who lived in a cave How China's Communist Party picks leaders Xie Yanyi was released on bail after a total of 18 months in detention. But he is not yet free of surveillance and intimidation. Shortly after we recorded our interview with him in late August, he was visited by the authorities and warned again. This time it was more specific: don't do anything that might upset the preparations for Communism's largest and most sacrosanct political gathering. The interrogators also threatened to arrest Mr Xie's wife Out of concern for his safety we agreed to a delay and have waited until after the Party Congress to publish this story. Even the recording itself - as viewers of the video on this page will see - was overshadowed by an ominous presence - a group of around a dozen men who surrounded Mr Xie's apartment. As we watched them out of the window, I asked him if, as a father with three children, it might be better for him to keep a low profile and to stay quiet for a bit? ""I am always quiet,"" came the reply. ""My family is kind to everyone. We are always sensible and peaceful."" ""We are lawful citizens. We are using our lawful rights. We hope all people can live with dignity, respect each other and abide by the rule of law."" As the BBC team left, the men surrounded our car, banging on the window and angrily demanding we open the doors. We refused to get out until, eventually, the police arrived. After an hour or so we were told we were free to go. It's a luxury that Xi Jinping's government does not afford to human rights lawyers and their families. Or for that matter, anyone who dares to stand in its way. How Chinese authorities censor your thoughts Human cost of China's economic reforms Communist slogans: Xi's the man.

"The Swedish furniture chain has a large presence in China Ikea has apologised and pulled a controversial television advertisement in China which some said was sexist. The commercial by the Swedish furniture chain shows a mother scolding her daughter for not ""bringing home a boyfriend"" to meet her parents. It attracted accusations of insensitivity towards single women. Unmarried females, colloquially known as ""leftover women"" in China, have long faced pressure to wed in a society that prioritises marriage. China 'leftover women' ad goes viral The over-27s China calls 'leftover women' Though Ikea pulled the 29-second advertisement after the uproar,copies can still be viewed online.,external It opens with a tense family dinner scene, where a young woman turns to her mother and says apprehensively, ""Mum..."" Her mother plonks down her chopsticks and retorts: ""If you don't bring home a boyfriend next time, then don't call me Mum!"" A well-dressed young man then appears at the door with a bouquet. The daughter introduces him as her boyfriend to her beaming parents, who whip out Ikea tableware and home decorations. The young woman smiles bashfully as her boyfriend appears at the door The advert parents are thrilled by his appearance The parents happily heap food into the boyfriend's rice bowl at the dinner table, while their bewildered daughter looks on. The ad, which rolled out this week, became an immediate talking point online and in the mainstream media. Many online said it was sexist. ""This discriminates against singles and single women. No boyfriend, so your own family members look down on you, what kind of values does this transmit?"" said one Weibo user. ""Even if this sort of situation does happen in a lot of families, it's not suitable to make advertisements about it, because it's wrong,"" said another Weibo user. Chinese women are often encouraged to marry and have children early Ikeaposted an apology,externalin Chinese and English on its Weibo account on Tuesday, saying it was sorry for ""giving the wrong perception"". ""This TV ad tried to show how Ikea can help customers easily and affordably convert a typical living room into a place for celebration. The purpose was to encourage customers to celebrate moments in everyday life,"" it said. It added that the company ""encourages people to live many different lifestyles"", and that ""gender equality is a fundamental part of the Ikea culture and values"". Its reply did little to mollify netizens, however, some of whom found it ironic that the advertisement came from a Swedish brand. ""It comes from a country that values women's rights, yet Ikea can actually come up with such an advertisement,"" said one commenter. Another said: ""As an international brand Ikea should bring us the best things from the world and benefit China. It shouldn't be learning bad things from China and spreading them to the world."" This video can not be played Single women over 27 in China are known as ""leftover women"" The topic of unmarried women has become more sensitive in recent years, as more Chinese women push back against the traditional notion that they must marry and have children at a young age. The ruling Chinese Communist Party has urged women to marry early - and a few years ago a government website featured articles about ""leftover women"" - defined as unmarried females above the age of 27 - until it received several complaints. Last year a Chinese advertisement by the Japanese skincare brand SK-II addressed the issue of ""leftover women"" in a campaign to end the stigma, which was received positively in China.

"Relations between the US and Iran have an outsized impact on the global trade in pistachios There are lots of casualties in international conflicts but this one is nuts, you might say - although strictly speaking the pistachio is a seed. The international pistachio trade has faced unexpected headwinds due to the tensions between Iran and the US. The global pistachio industry is a multi-billion dollar a year sector that is continuing to grow in value as its popularity as a foodstuff grows. The US and Iran dominate the world's trade in pistachios - collectively controlling between 70% and 80% of yearly output for the last decade. Over the last forty years, Iran's growers have faced pressures from sanctions, tariffs and restrictions on their ability to access international financial tools. Although pistachios themselves were not on the list of sanctioned products, restrictions on global banking made trade difficult for Iranian farmers. All that changed in 2016 following the Iran nuclear deal, officiallyThe Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action(JCPOA). This agreement with the US and its allies removed sanctions. It wasn't just Iranian oil that came flowing back onto the international market, pistachio exports began gaining overseas markets. That progress could face challenges though. US President Donald Trump called the agreement created under his predecessor the ""worst"" deal the US has ever made. In October he decertified the agreement. The move passes responsibility to the US Congress to evaluate and determine whether it believes Iran is compliant with the terms and if the US should remain in the deal. Over 90% of US pistachios are grown in California President Trump said in the speech announcing his decision that the agreement ""threw Iran's dictatorship a political and economic lifeline,"" but had failed to prevent Iran's ""sprint"" towards nuclear weapon development. For Iran's pistachio industry the threat of losing the deal and reinstating sanctions could mean the return of what Hojat Hassani Sadi, deputy director of the Iran Pistachio Association calls ""unfair and unequal competition"". The pistachio industry in Iran dates back thousands of years. By contrast, pistachio farming in the US started in the 1930s with Persian seeds. The boom in commercial pistachio cultivation came after the US severed ties with Iran following the1979 hostage crisis,after which the US and its allies placed sanctions on Iran. Over the next several decades, even in countries where Iranian pistachios were welcomed, restrictions on its companies' ability to access international financing made it hard for the industry to flourish. Archaeological evidence suggests pistachios were first grown in what is now Iraq in 7,000BC During that time the US market expanded, with farmers - mainly across California - planting the crop. But in 2014. hot and dry weather conditions across the western US cost the industry nearly half its crop and cut profits for 2015 - the year those nuts were sold - by close to $1.4bn (Â£1bn). Globally, pistachio prices rose, but for Iran's growers it was also an opportunity. The price of pistachios has been on the rise since 2002. Richard Matoian, executive director of the American Pistachio Growers (APG) trade association, attributes this to increased awareness of theirhealth propertiesand global demand for healthy snacks. ""The industry has been pushing the products with advertising,"" he says, adding that middle-class demand in developing markets has also boosted exports. More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade: A blockage in global waste disposal Are big brand perfumes losing their allure? Are these the best job perks in the world? The Italians who prefer American coffee What it takes to get Beyonce on a world tour The problem for the worldâs most expensive spice Read more global trade series here Increased demand in China has been key to sector growth. Between 2008 and 2013 Chinese imports of US pistachios rose 146% according to APG. But the 2014 drought saw the price of California's nuts rocket from $3/lb (453g) to over $5/lb. By contrast Iran's pistachio yield that year was strong. In markets like China, they were able to undercut American prices by close to $0.20/lb. Pistachio plants grow best in arid climates but that leave crops vulnerable to water shortages A strong growing year in 2016 has helped the US market recover and led to a moderation in price. But Iran has another advantage that helps it in global trade - its location. ""Iran has a transportation advantage. They can certainly take markets away and China is an example of that,"" says Mr Matoian. The advantages and disadvantages for Iran are not only linked to sanctions. Iran claims its pistachios have a better taste, as do several large European distributors, though the US and Iran mainly grow the same strain. (Turkish pistachios, for example, are a different variety.) The US also imposes a 241% tariff on Iranian pistachios meaning even without sanctions the US market has been all but cut off for Iran. Aging water infrastructure in Iran is a major difficultly for Iran's farmers Water shortages are another problem for Iran. According to Mr Sadi it is the ""major obstacle to growth"" for his industry. Iran's pistachio sector is second in the world following the strong 2016 season in the US. And with the two countries dominating so much of the global market, Iran isn't in dire need of a comeback. But for the growing number of pistachio fans around the world increased access to Iran's pistachio exports and decreasing prices would be a sweet outcome.

"This video can not be played Qantas boss Alan Joyce tells Today why Australia is an incredible ""meritocracy"" Alan Joyce, boss of the Australian airline Qantas, has been named the world's most influential LGBT business executive in an annual listing. He was chosen for his vocal campaigning in favour of same-sex marriage, an issue Australians are voting on now. ""No one should feel like they need to live a double life,"" said Mr Joyce. Networking group OUTstanding and the Financial Times compile the annual list recognising positive LGBT role models in business. ""In the past year I've worked hard to drive changes in my own workplace and indeed my own country,"" Mr Joyce said. As well as speaking up personally on the question of same-sex marriage, Mr Joyce has encouraged other business leaders to join him in campaigning for a ""yes"" vote in the Australian ballot. He said more than 1,300 firms have put their name to the cause. Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has promised that if a majority of Australians support same-sex marriage in the poll, parliament will debate amending the Marriage Act, which could lead to the country becoming the 25th country to permit same-sex marriage. The ballot will close on 7 November; latest reports indicate that nearly three-quarters of eligible voters have already returned their ballots with nearly two weeks left to go. Why are businesses taking a stand on political debates? Australia's heated same-sex marriage debate Watch: Lord Browne says more gay business people should come out ""As an openly gay man and being the leader of this organisation and a high profile business leader in Australia, I felt it was very important that I led by example and was out there promoting the case,"" Mr Joyce told the BBC. Results of the postal ballot will be announced on 15 November Mr Joyce was born in Ireland and took over as chief executive of Qantas in 2008. Last month eyebrows were raised as his remuneration package almost doubled to nearly A$25m (Â£14.5m) following a significant rise in the Qantas share price. ""I think Australia is a great meritocracy. Where else in the world would you have an openly gay Irish man coming to this country to run probably the most iconic Australian brand in the world?"" he said. However, in March Australia's Immigration Minister Peter Dutton criticised Mr Joyce and other business leaders for intervening in the debate. And in May a man smeared a lemon meringue pie in Mr Joyce's face during a public event, apparently in response to his pro-equal marriage stance. The OUTstanding list, which has been running for five years, also names the chief executive of Campbell Soup, Denise Morrison, as the leading ""Ally Executive"" for her role in supporting members of the LGBT community in the workplace. The list's authors said Ms Morrison had gone further than other executives in supporting diversity, through policies such as celebrating Pride events, offering a gender-neutral parental leave policy and urging the repeal of a measure in North Carolina requiring transgender persons to use bathrooms corresponding to the sex on their birth certificate. Stuart Barette, a senior project manager at HSBC, was named OUTstanding Future Leader and praised as a transgender role model.

"BT will slash costs for customers who only have a landline, after a review by regulator Ofcom. From April 2018, the telecoms company will reduce the price of its monthly line rental by Â£7, a 37% decrease from the current cost of Â£18.99. The reduction will save up to a million households Â£84 a year, and customers will have their rental costs capped at the rate of inflation. Ofcom expects three other providers to follow suit. Nearly two-thirds of BT customers with only a landline are over 65 and more than three-quarters have never switched provider, the regulator said. Ofcom said they had been getting poor value for money in recent years, compared to those who buy bundles of landline, broadband and/or pay-TV services. BT said it welcomed ""a balanced voluntary agreement with Ofcom"" and that it had ""listened to the concerns of our line-only customers"". Two other providers have increased their rental charges by even more than BT. According to Ofcom, both Sky and Virgin Media have put up their charges by 47% above the rate of inflation since 2009. At the same time the wholesale cost of providing the service has actually fallen by 27% in real terms. ""For many people, their landline is their lifeline,"" said Jonathan Oxley, Ofcom's competition group director. ""But households who only have a landline - and no broadband - have seen their phone bills soar. Many are elderly and have been with BT for decades. We've been clear that they must get a better deal."" The other firms that provide landline-only deals, Virgin Media, Sky and the Post Office, have not yet commentated on whether they will reduce their charges. However Virgin Media said it had already frozen rental charges for elderly and disabled customers at Â£17.99 a month. The Post Office said it would look again at the issue. Talk Talk withdrew from that part of the market, to concentrate on broadband and phone bundles. Age UK said it was disappointed that BT had to be prompted to cut charges by the regulator. ""We welcome the reduced tariffs, but we do find it disappointing that it has taken the intervention from Ofcom for this to happen,"" said Caroline Abrahams, charity director at Age UK. Ofcom also said it wanted to help those who buy a phone service from one provider and broadband from another.

Using just the thrust of its jet engine, the vehicle raced to 210mph (340km/h) down the runway at Newquay Airport in southwest England. Ultimately,Bloodhound,externalwill be fitted with a rocket motor as well so that it can go 1,000mph (1,610km/h). That will not happen for two to three years, but the Newquay tests have given the team confidence that the car can achieve its designed performance. Driven by RAF Wing Commander Andy Green, Bloodhound SSC made two trips down Newquay's 1.7-mile (2.7km) runway. Diary: Jet engine's stamp of approval Supersonic car fires up jet engine Chinese auto group backs Bloodhound Climb inside Andy Green's cockpit More than 3,000 VIPs and members of the Bloodhound supporters club were in attendance to see the Eurofighter EJ200 jet engine take the vehicle from a standing start to 200mph in about eight seconds. As well as the ear-splitting noise, the crowd was treated to the bright glare of the engine on reheat. ""We did two back-to-back 200mph runs in a five-tonne car. It felt like about eight seconds, which was what we were expecting,"" Wing Commander Green said on stepping out of the cockpit. ""It was a real hard work-out for the brakes. Probably up to somewhere close to a thousand degrees, the front brakes were smoking furiously after the second run. They just started to flicker with flame - very sort of Formula One, but in a proper high-speed car. And that was exactly what we were hoping for,"" he told BBC News. This video can not be played Bloodhound: Numbers of the beast These ""slow-speed"" trials are really at the limit of what can be done here in the UK. To go faster, Bloodhound will have to head abroad. Next year, it hopes to be on Hakskeen Pan in Northern Cape, South Africa. This dried-out lake bed is super-flat and extends for 12 miles (19km), providing ample space to get up to some very high speeds and then slow and stop safely. Bloodhound still awaits its rocket motor which will go in the hole below the jet engine Testing in Newquay these past few weeks makes the team believe the car can attain 650mph (1,050km/h) with just the EJ200. That is not enough to break the world land speed record (763mph/1,227km/h), but it would take the vehicle into a performance region where engineers would learn a lot more about its capabilities. At over 400mph, the wheels can no longer turn as fast as the car moves and act more like the rudders on a boat. And at 650mph, some of the airflows over Bloodhound's body would approach the sound barrier. This is all knowledge needed to go 800mph in 2019, and then up to 1,000mph in 2020 - when the rocket technology becomes available. This video can not be played Meet Ron Ayers. the 85-year-old aerodynamicist behind the Bloodhound car This is currently being developed by the Norwegian aerospace and defence company Nammo. The Scandinavian firm expects to have two versions available for Bloodhound. The first - a so-called monopropellant motor - should provide sufficient additional thrust to set a new land speed record. The second - what is termed a hybrid motor - will be even more powerful and will be incorporated into Bloodhound following some aerodynamic upgrades to its rear end. ""The total thrust we think we need is about 20 tonnes. So that's a thrust-to-weight ratio of about two-and-a-half. The car when we're breaking records will weigh about eight tonnes,"" said Bloodhound technical director, Mark Chapman. One other significant change to the car by then could be the introduction of a major electric component. The rocket will need oxidiser pushed through it and at the moment the motor destined to drive the pump is a V8 from a Jaguar sports car. But such have been the advances in batteries and capacitors in recent years, the team now thinks these technologies could take over the role of the internal combustion engine. The swap might also give more flexibility to engineers as they look to redistribute weight around the car as it targets higher and higher speeds. Two more days of public running lie ahead. One is on Saturday, for which a few tickets remain,external. The other is on Monday, organised with Cornwall County Council and aimed at local secondary schools. Education is a primary motivation for the Bloodhound project - to inspire children in their study of STEM subjects. Jess Herbert is a product of this initiative. She won an apprenticeship with Rolls-Royce after Bloodhound got her interested in engineering, and even acts now as one of the project's education ambassadors. ""The outreach team - they go out to schools and do workshops and presentations,"" she explained. ""Recently at Rolls-Royce, we ran a 'bring your daughter to work day', where we built rocket-powered cars inspired by Bloodhound. And it was incredible; they loved it.""

"This video can not be played James Tringham, who has bipolar disorder, explains that being at work has a ""normalising effect"" Hayley Smith says her manager encouraged her to apply for other jobs when she told her she had depression. The news about her illness spread across the office. ""It was horrible - I felt really exposed,"" she says. After a few anxious, unhappy months, she left. Hayley is one of up to 300,000 people with mental health problems who leave their jobs each year, a report says. The report by mental health experts also says poor mental health costs the UK economy up to Â£99bn each year. Paul Farmer, co-author ofthe Thriving At Work report,external, said mental health was a taboo subject in many workplaces. Can you talk about mental health at work? The illness that affects one in six of us Mental health staff on stress leave up 22% Mr Farmer, who is chief executive of mental health charity Mind, said: ""Opportunities are missed to prevent poor mental health and ensure that employees who may be struggling get the support they need. ""In many instances, employers simply don't understand the crucial role they can play, or know where to go for advice and support."" The review makes 40 recommendations for how to support employees to remain at work, including creating an online wellbeing portal and using digital technology to support workers in the gig economy. Companies are also being encouraged to include a section on employee mental health in their annual reports. Currently only 11% of companies do this, the report said. Prime Minister Theresa May, who commissioned the report, said it showed ""we need to take action"". The civil service has agreed to take on the report's recommendations. Hayley Smith lost her job when she told her employer about her depression One employer the report praised is the insurer, Aviva. James Tringham, who has worked for the company for seven years, said it helped him get his life back on track after suffering with bipolar disorder. ""In 2009, I'd reached crisis point with my mental health, and I gave up my career as a solicitor,"" he says. ""I was unable to work for over a year - the prospect of returning to work was just so frightening and not something that I could imagine."" Eventually he got a job in the insurer's contact centre. ""They gave me a way back into employment and I have worked my way back up. ""Aviva have been brilliant in supporting me to manage my mental health at work, and have given me my confidence back. ""There's an understanding, which means little things like adjusting my workload when I'm feeling on the low side can really help. And the staff - both officially and unofficially - form a great support network."" Footballer Aaron Lennon returned to training after receiving mental health support Create a mental health at work plan Build mental health awareness by making information and support accessible Encourage open conversations Provide good working conditions and ensure employees have a healthy work-life balance Promote effective people management, with line managers holding regular conversations about health and well-being with their staff Routinely monitor employee mental health The review said that people with long-term mental health problems were leaving jobs at twice the rate of colleagues with no such issues, although it did say that some people may be counted twice - if they left one job, returned to work elsewhere after a break but were then unable to continue in their new post. The report also pointed out the cost to employers, estimating they were losing Â£42bn each year because of staff suffering from mental health problems. Mrs May said: ""It is only by making this an everyday concern for everyone that we change the way we see mental illness, so that striving to improve your mental health - whether at work or at home - is seen as just as positive as improving our physical well-being."" What is mental health? For Hayley Smith, support from her employer could have made her chronic depression more bearable. After leaving her job, she started her own company. Five years on, she now employs others. ""In the long term, it's given me awareness of mental health,"" she says.

"This video can not be played Speaking in September 2017, claimants told the BBC about the problems they faced The six-week waiting time for universal credit should be cut and be a maximum of one month, MPs say. The Work and Pensions Select Committee said the six-week wait before claimants receive their first payment was causing ""acute financial difficulty"". It said reducing the delay - designed to mimic waiting for a first pay cheque for a new job - would remove a ""major obstacle"" to the policy's success. Theresa May has said the government was listening and was making changes. At Wednesday's Prime Minister's Questions, Mrs May defended the concept of universal credit, which she said was a ""simpler"" system that ""makes sure work pays"". Universal credit, which rolls six working-age benefits into a single payment, is designed to make the system simpler and ensure no-one faces a situation where they would be better off claiming benefits than working. But it has faced a backlash from some MPs, who fear payment delays risk pushing families into destitution. What is universal credit? 'My five-year-old searched bins for food' Archbishop calls for cut to universal credit delays Universal credit helpline charges scrapped Conservative committee member Heidi Allen said: ""Despite the clear support for universal credit, there is cross-party recognition that the six-week wait does not honour the original intentions of the system. ""To truly represent the world of work, the payment cycle must mirror how the majority of people are paid i.e. monthly."" The cross-party committee said advance payments could ""mitigate some of the unwelcome consequences of the current design of universal credit, but they do not address their underlying foundations"". Its report concluded: ""The baked-in six-week wait for the first payment in universal credit is a major obstacle to the success of the policy. ""In areas where the full service has rolled out, evidence compellingly links it to an increase in acute financial difficulty."" Work and pensions committee chairman Frank Field said the waiting period for the first payment was ""cruel"". ""Such a long wait bears no relation to anyone's working life and the terrible hardship it has been proven to cause actually makes it more difficult for people to find work,"" the Labour MP said. Universal credit has been introduced in stages to different groups of claimants over the past four years, with about 610,000 people now receiving it. Almost a quarter of all claimants have had to wait more than six weeks to receive their first payment in full because of errors and problems evidencing claims. But the government recently approved a major extension of the programme to a further 45 job centres across the country, with another 50 to be added each month. Don't ignore Parliament, Tory MP warns Universal credit helpline charges scrapped 'Selling everything' because of universal credit.

"This video can not be played Kenya's election re-run explained Kenya's presidential election re-run has been marred by isolated clashes and a boycott by the main opposition. A teenage boy was shot by police and later died amid clashes in the opposition stronghold of Kisumu, one of four counties hit by violence. The electoral commission said voting in those areas would be postponed until Saturday. President Uhuru Kenyatta was declared the winner in an August vote, which was annulled because of ""irregularities"". Mr Kenyatta is seeking a second term. Opposition leader Raila Odinga has pulled out of the contest. Legitimacy of Kenya re-run unclear Kenya's controversial vote as it happened Kenya needs healing Key moment for African democracy Tens of thousands of police and other security staff deployed to protect voters and polling stations, which closed at 17:00 local time (14:00 GMT). International observers have scaled down their missions for security reasons. The electoral commission has seven days to declare the results. After casting his vote in the town of Gatundu, Mr Kenyatta had urged people to cast their ballots so the country could move on. ""We're tired as a country of electioneering. It's time we moved forward,"" he said, adding that most of the country was ""calm and peaceful"". Kisumu Governor Peter Anyang' Nyong'o, father of the Oscar-winning actress Lupita Nyong'o, said 29 people had been injured and two killed by police. BBC's Emmanuel Igunza at the scene in Kisumu Live rounds have been fired by police in the opposition stronghold of Kisumu, in western Kenya, killing at least one person. Nineteen-year-old George Odhiambo was brought to the main hospital in Kisumu bleeding heavily from a thigh wound. His brother told me that they had been sitting outside their house watching opposition demonstrations when he was shot. Four other patients nursing gunshot wounds are all in a stable condition. We've been coming across pockets of protesters as we drive around the city - with police firing teargas to disperse them. Most people here have heeded the boycott call by the opposition and stayed at home, and many polling stations have been barricaded to stop any would-be voters. A voting official in Kisumu told me just three of 399 polling station officials had turned up, fearing they might face intimidation for taking part in the election. A lone but determined voter came to the main polling distribution centre this morning to find out how he could vote as his polling station was closed. BBC Kenya analyst Dickens Olewe says the ethnic divide can already be seen in the voting, with a high turnout so far in regions where President Kenyatta's Kikuyu community and Deputy President William Ruto's Kalenjin community reside. In parts of western Kenya where Mr Odinga's Luo community is mostly based, there is a near-100% boycott of the poll. The electoral commission has postponed voting until Saturday in the western counties of Homa Bay, Kisumu, Migori and Siaya because of ""security challenges"". These areas are all likely to continue observing the opposition's boycott. This video can not be played Kenya opposition supporters bring machetes and rocks to election protests Ethnic-based politics is deep-seated in Kenya, fuelled by the illusion that if ""one of us"" is in power then people from that community will benefit, he says. Some Kenyans may also feel Mr Odinga's withdrawal makes the competition somewhat redundant; others may be just fed up with the ongoing political crisis - all factors that could affect the overall turnout, he adds. Uhuru Kenyatta: Kenya's 'digital president' Raila Odinga - love him or loathe him Full election coverage The announcement by the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) of Mr Kenyatta's victory on 8 August led to inflammatory rhetoric and attacks on the body. President Uhuru Kenyatta, posing here with a voter, said it was time for the country to move on Last week,a senior member of the IEBC fled to the USamid death threats. About 50 people are reported to have been killed in violence since Mr Kenyatta was declared the winner in August's election. Mr Odinga had wanted the repeat ballot to be held at a later date, but a bid to delay the election re-run fell apart after only two of seven Supreme Court judges attended a hearing on Wednesday. One judge, Deputy Chief Justice Philomena Mwilu, failed to appear after her bodyguard was shot and wounded by unknown gunmen on Tuesday. Kenya's Supreme Court took the unprecedented decision to annul the August presidential election and demand a re-run in September citing ""irregularities and illegalities"". Voting in the re-run has been calm in most areas Chief Justice David Maraga said the election had not been ""conducted in accordance with the constitution"" and declared it ""invalid, null and void"". He said the verdict, which was backed by four of the six Supreme Court judges, found that the IECB had committed irregularities ""in the transmission of results"". The court said the result was ""neither transparent nor verifiable"". The ruling did not attribute any blame to President Kenyatta's party or campaign but it nevertheless raised tensions, with rival protests in support of and against the court. There were running battles between police firing tear gas and stone-throwing protesters in the city of Kisumu, an opposition stronghold, on Wednesday. Mr Odinga has said that the IECB failed to make the changes needed to prevent a repeat of the mistakes that marred the earlier poll, although the IECB disputes this. His opposition coalition - the National Super Alliance (Nasa) - made clear its participation in the election was contingent on reforms being made. Raila Odinga told his supporters: ""We are going to win the battle"" Mr Odinga had vowed to disrupt Thursday's vote, calling for ""massive"" demonstrations, but has asked his supporters to stay away from polling stations in an attempt to avoid violent clashes. In a statement earlier this month, he accused the government of instituting a ""dictatorship"", adding: ""We are going to win the battle for a free and fair election"". ""Our opponents want an election for the sake of it, we want a better election,"" he said.
