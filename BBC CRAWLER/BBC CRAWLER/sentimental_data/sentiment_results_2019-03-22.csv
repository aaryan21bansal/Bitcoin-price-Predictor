"The BBC said Sir David's film would be ""an unflinching exploration"" Sir David Attenborough is to present an ""urgent"" new documentary about climate change for BBC One. The one-off film will focus on the potential threats to our planet and the possible solutions. The broadcaster says ""conditions have changed far faster"" than he ever imagined when he first started talking about the environment 20 years ago. The documentary will show footage showing the impact global warming has already had. It will also feature interviews with climatologists and meteorologists to explore the science behind recent extreme weather conditions, including the California wildfires in November 2018. Red carpets cancelled after wildfires Celebrity homes destroyed by wildfires Last December, Sir David called climate change ""humanity's greatest threat in thousands of years"" at the opening ceremony of the United Nations climate change conference. He said it could lead to the collapse of civilisations and the extinction of ""much of the natural world"". What is a climate emergency? Rain melts Greenland ice even in winter 'Attenborough would have rescued penguins' Earlier this year he spoke to Prince William at the World Economic Forum about how people must care, respect and revere the natural world. Sir David, 92, said that when he started his career in the mid-1950s, he did not think there was anybody who thought ""there was a danger that we might annihilate part of the natural world."" This video can not be played Sir David told Prince William it was ""difficult to overstate"" the threat of climate change ""It may sound frightening, but the scientific evidence is that if we have not taken dramatic action within the next decade, we could face irreversible damage to the natural world and the collapse of our societies,"" he says in the documentary. The BBC said the film would ""deliver an unflinching exploration of what dangerous levels of climate change could mean for human populations."" ""There is a real hunger from audiences to find out more about climate change and understand the facts,"" said Charlotte Moore, the BBC's director of content. ""We have a trusted guide in Sir David Attenborough, who will be speaking to the challenging issues that it raises, and present an engaging and informative look at one of the biggest issues of our time.""

"Charlotte Howard spotted the note as she was waiting for a bus to go to college A man who has been living on the streets for nine years has been found a home and job after a teenager spotted his note posted next to a bus stop. Anthony Johnson's note said he was looking for a job ""to make life worth living"". Charlotte Howard, 16, saw the note on the Hastings bus stop and decided to post an appeal on social media. She has so far raised Â£1,000 and found a caravan for Mr Johnson, who has also been offered a job as a handyman. Charlotte said when she saw Anthony's note at the bus stop next to his tent it ""broke her heart"". Mr Johnson's note read: ""I will do a trial for free to show how I work. I don't take drugs or drink. ""I will also do dog walking/minding, window cleaning, shopping, gardening, car valeting/washing, housework, cooking.. ""Anything to earn a living and make life seem worth living."" Charlotte posted an appeal for donations online: ""There is a caravan for sale and it cost Â£100, the goal is Â£300 as it needs some work done."" Charlotte told BBC Sussex:  ""Everyone deserves a home."" She said the caravan was donated to Mr Johnson and now a local homeless charity is trying to find a permanent site for it.

"Libby Squire was last seen in the early hours of 1 February The death of Hull student Libby Squire is being treated as ""a potential homicide"", Humberside Police has said. The 21-year-old's body was found in the Humber estuary on Wednesday, seven weeks after she went missing following a night out on 1 February. Detectives said she could have been killed but ""would not be releasing results of a post-mortem examination for investigative reasons"". Det Supt Martin Smalley said ""one man remains under investigation"". He said: ""In regards to our investigation, while we have considered throughout the missing person inquiry that Libby may have come to some harm, Libby's death and the recovery of her body now leads us to solely investigate as a potential homicide. ""The post-mortem examination concluded late last night and at this stage, we will not be releasing any results for investigative and operational reasons."" An inquest into her death is due to open and adjourn on Monday. Flowers and tributes have been left on a bench in Hull's Beverley Road where Ms Squire was last seen Det Supt Smalley said specially trained officers were continuing to support Ms Squire's family. ""Our thoughts remain today with Libby's family and friends at this incredibly sad and devastating time for them,"" he said. ""Libby captured the hearts of not just the people in Hull, but across the country, and as I have said before, the support shown has been overwhelming and my sincerest thanks to absolutely everyone who has been involved."" Hull Minster has invited people to light a candle in memory of the student Libby's body was recovered at around 15:30 GMT on Wednesday close to Spurn Point and taken to Grimsby Docks. A major police inquiry saw hundreds of officers and about 50 detectives search for the student. On the night of her disappearance, police believe Ms Squire got a taxi at the Welly Club music venue before arriving at her student house in Wellesley Avenue at about 23:30 on 31 January, where her mobile phone was found. They think she did not enter the house and have said her phone ""has not provided any further insight as to her movements that night"". She was spotted on CCTV 10 minutes later near a bench on Beverley Road, where it is thought a motorist stopped to offer her help. The bench has become a focal point for those wishing to remember Ms Squire, from High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, and floral tributes have been left at the site.

"Thousands of people are still awaiting rescue from flooded areas across in southern Africa A week after the flooded Mozambican port of Beira was hit by Cyclone Idai, cases of cholera have been recorded, a humanitarian aid group said on Friday. The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) warned of the risk of other outbreaks, already noting an increase in malaria. The storm has so far killed 557 people across Mozambique, Zimbabwe and Malawi, butthe death toll is expected to rise. Idai made landfall near Beira with 177km/h (106 mph) winds on 14 March. Aid workers are slowly delivering relief but conditions are said to be extremely difficult, with some areas completely inaccessible and a scarcity of helicopters. Some 1.7 million people are said to be affected across southern Africa, with no electricity or running water in areas where homes have been swept away and roads destroyed by the floods. Cyclone Idai: What are the dangers? 'We saw 200 bodies by the roadside' Maps reveal Cyclone Idai's destruction ""There is growing concern among aid groups on the ground of potential disease outbreaks,"" the IFRC statement said. ""Already, some cholera cases have been reported in Beira along with an increasing number of malaria infections among people trapped by the flooding."" Cholera, which is endemic in Mozambique, is spread by water contaminated by sewage, and can kill within hours if left untreated. ""There's stagnant water, it's not draining, decomposing bodies, lack of good hygiene and sanitation,"" Henrietta Fore, the head of Unicef who is in Mozambique, told AFP news agency. This video can not be played 'It has become an inland sea' ""We are running out of time, it is at a critical point here,"" she said, warning that hygiene and safe drinking water were absolute priorities. ""The scale of this crisis is staggering,"" Elhadj As Sy, the head of the IFRC, said after seeing Beira, which was home to 500,000 people. ""We can't forget that it is an intimate and human crisis. Tens of thousands of families have lost everything. Children have lost parents. Communities have lost schools and clinics."" In pictures: Cyclone Idai devastation Idai and the climate connection 'My hotel haven for cyclone homeless' A spokesperson for the World Food Programme (WFP) said the aid effort was ""slow to start, [but]... is now accelerating, thankfully."" ""We are not yet where it needs to be,"" he told AFP. The United Nations has released $20m (Â£15m) from its emergency fund, and on Friday its chief made a personal appeal for more international support. Aid groups said Mozambique has borne the brunt of flooding from rivers that flow downstream from neighbouring countries. At least 65,000 people are sheltering in 100 temporary sites, many of which are in ""desperate conditions"", according to the UN. Many people are said to have not yet received emergency rations, with some still clinging to rooftops and trees.

"The men suffered serious electrical burns on the line between Hackney Wick and Stratford Two men found dead on the train tracks had been riding on top of a freight train wagon, police said. Officers were called to the line between Hackney Wick and Stratford in east London in the early hours of Thursday. British Transport Police said a 27-year-old man from Clerkenwell and a 25-year-old man from Aberystwyth suffered severe electrical burns and died. Their next of kin were being supported by family liaison officers, it added. Det Sgt David Taylor said officers had worked throughout the night to understand what had happened to the men. He added: ""The initial evidence that we've been able to gather suggests that both men were on top of a moving freight train wagon when they came into contact with the overhead power lines."" On Thursday, a police spokesman confirmed they were investigating whether the victims were graffiti artists or possibly ""train surfers"".

"The email allegedly sent to Connor Scothern was said to be a ""masterpiece of back-covering"" Two men accused of being members of an illegal neo-Nazi group were urged to destroy evidence, a court has heard. Connor Scothern and Garry Jack have denied being members of National Action (NA). Birmingham Crown Court was told the pair received an email telling them to ""throw away or burn any memorabilia"" following police counter-terror raids. Prosecutors said the message sent by another NA member showed they were part of the group. Barnaby Jameson QC, prosecuting, said it was a ""masterpiece of back-covering"". The message, headed ""recent news"", read: ""I am sure you have all heard the news that four men have been arrested on the grounds that they are members of the terrorist organisation NA."" Advising several recipients to distance themselves from NA, the message added: ""Delete any affiliations you have to the group. ""Throw away or burn any memorabilia you are holding on to. If anyone is caught breaking the NA proscription or advocating for NA or even holding any NA memorabilia they will be kicked from the group. ""Stay safe and be smart. They are watching the far right's every step now and if even one of us slips up it will cost all of us. This is an all for one and one for all situation."" Alice Cutter, who was alleged to have entered a ""Miss Hitler"" contest, and Mark Jones also deny being part of NA Mr Jones and Mr Jack said they were ""committed and unapologetic"" members of NA but quit the organisation when it was banned, the court heard. They are on trial alongside Alice Cutter, 22, and her partner Mark Jones, 24, both of Mulhalls Mill, Sowerby Bridge, West Yorkshire, who both deny being members of NA between December 2016 and September 2017. Mr Jack, 23, from Heathland Avenue, Shard End, Birmingham, and Mr Scothern, 18, of Bagnall Avenue, Nottingham, are charged with belonging to the organisation between the same dates.

"This video can not be played North Lanarkshire Council alerted police after discovering video evidence from Clydeview School in Motherwell A school for children with additional needs is being investigated by police after footage emerged of staff using ""inappropriate restraint techniques,"" the BBC has learned. North Lanarkshire Council alerted police after discovering video evidence from Clydeview School in Motherwell. The BBC understands a member of staff has been suspended over the footage. It shows staff restraining a nine-year-old autistic boy. The investigation concerns a ""small number"" of pupils. Parents of children at the school have been informed. In a letter Derek Brown, North Lanarkshire Council's joint interim director of children and families, wrote: ""We have discovered evidence of what, on the face of it, appears to be inappropriate use of pupil restraint and inappropriate restraint techniques being used."" Mr Brown told parents the evidence was ""historical and not current"". But he added: ""It will be for the police to investigate and determine whether a criminal offence has taken place."" It is understood that the most recent allegations date back to June 2018. The development comes just days after Education Scotland produced a withering inspection report on the school, describing it as ""weak"" in two categories - Learning, Teaching and Assessment, and Raising Attainment and Achievement. It was also graded ""unsatisfactory"" in the categories of Leadership of Change, and Ensuring Wellbeing, Equality and Inclusion. The inspectors also called for a series of measures, including a review of child protection documentation and additional staff training. Police Scotland confirmed detectives are examining the evidence. A force spokeswoman said: ""An investigation is under way after Police Scotland was made aware by the local authority of concerns about the conduct of staff at a school in North Lanarkshire. ""Inquiries, which are at an early stage, are under way."" A North Lanarkshire Council spokesman said: ""Video evidence has come to light showing what appears to be inappropriate use of restraint and the deployment of inappropriate restraint techniques involving a small number of pupils at Clydeview School. ""The safety and wellbeing of children in our care is our primary concern and, on being presented with this material, we took immediate steps to launch a formal investigation. ""Given the nature of some of the video evidence, we also immediately contacted Police Scotland."" The spokesman added: ""Both of these investigations are at an early stage and we will keep parents updated as they progress. ""The safety of children is paramount and we are confident that there is no risk to children attending the school."" Last year Scotland's children and young people's commissioner expressed concern about the ""ungoverned"" and potentially illegal use of restraint and seclusion in the country's schools. Bruce Adamsontold The Guardian,external: ""We are deeply concerned that significant physical interventions may be taking place without any kind of policy or procedure at local authority level to ensure the lawful and rights-compliant treatment of children.""

"It's the story that has dominated Donald Trump's presidency. But it's complicated. Let's take a step back. US intelligence agencies believe Russia tried to sway the election in favour of Mr Trump. A special counsel looked into whether anyone from his campaign colluded in the effort. After two years, we have a 448-page report in which the special counsel finds no evidence the campaign conspired with Russia. No, Robert Mueller also looked at 10 instances where the president obstructed justice. But he was unable to decide whether they amounted to a crime. His report also found that the Russian government did interfere in the election. Not really. We found out he tried to fire Mr Mueller. He had called it a witch hunt from the start. No. It was conducted by the hugely respected Mr Mueller, a Republican who used to run the FBI. There were several meetings between senior members of Mr Trump's team with Russian officials. Several meetings were not initially disclosed. Ex-National Security Adviser Michael Flynn lied to the FBI about meeting the Russian ambassador to the US before Mr Trump took office. The president's son, Donald Jr, met a Russian lawyer who said she had ""dirt"" on Hillary Clinton during the campaign. He brought charges against several of Mr Trump's inner circle. Ex-adviser Roger Stone has been charged with lying to Congress about his contacts with Wikileaks, which released emails belonging to Democratic officials that had allegedly been hacked by Russians. Mr Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen admitted lying to Congress, campaign finance violations and tax evasion and received a 36-month prison sentence. And former campaign chairman Paul Manafort lied to the FBI about his work in Ukraine, according to special counsel Robert Mueller, with whom he had been co-operating. Manafort has been jailed for bank fraud. Since he fired the man leading one of the investigations, ex-FBI Director James Comey, there were questions about whether he obstructed justice.

"Robert Mueller's report goes first to the attorney general, who will decide how much to release to the public It's been 22 months since former FBI Director Robert Mueller was appointed to head a special investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and whether the Trump campaign was involved. Now his work is done and his report has been submitted to the Department of Justice. But what does that mean? Time Magazine senior editor Ryan Teague Beckwith has described trying to keep up with the twists in the Mueller investigation as akin to understanding the plot of a Russian novel by listening to a book club conversation. Now, at last, perhaps we will see the full manuscript. Or at least the CliffsNotes (that's York Notes to you Brits). Or maybe we won't. If it all seems confusing, that's because no-one knows exactly what happens next. It doesn't mean we'll know all the details immediately - or ever. The notoriously tight-lipped former FBI director could simply announce that his work is done, pack his bags and go back to a private life of golf clubs, corporate boards, academic speaking engagements and trips to the Apple store Genius Bar. Not necessarily. In fact, probably not. It doesn't seem likely there will be a detailed investigative narrative presented to the public similar to the multi-tome report produced by Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr back in 1998. Boxes and boxes of the Starr report Mr Starr's wide-ranging investigation that started with a real-estate inquiry and ended up scouring Bill Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky was governed by a federal statute with different rules. And Mr Starr himself - a former judge and Republican administration lawyer - was a different kind of man to the by-the-books ex-Marine Mueller. Mr Mueller's probe is conducted under the auspices of the Justice Department and isgoverned by its regulations,external. The special counsel's obligations at the conclusion of his work are to provide a ""confidential report"" to Attorney General Bill Barr explaining his prosecutorial decisions. The Trump-Russia saga in 250 words What does the special counsel do? Mr Barr must then provide the top members of the Senate and House Judiciary committees with a brief explanation of any actions taken - or instances where he overruled the special counsel's proposed action. It is up to the attorney general to decide whether it would be in the ""public interest"" to make any of these reports or communications accessible to the rest of us. This is the million-dollar question. In his testimony during his January Senate confirmation hearings, Mr Barr was repeatedly pressed by Democrats to promise he would make public any findings or reports produced by the Mueller investigation. He demurred. Now, in his just-released letter to senior members of Congress, the attorney general seems eager to tell us more. ""I am reviewing the report and anticipate that I may be in a position to advise you of the Special Counsel's principal conclusions as soon as this weekend,"" he writes. Who's who in the drama to end all dramas? Five big things Mueller is looking at Traditionally the Justice Department has been reluctant to provide information about investigations that do not lead to criminal prosecution. That was a guideline notably violated by former FBI Director James Comey during his July 2016 press statement outlining the results of a federal investigation into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server while she was Barack Obama's secretary of state. It would be ironic, to say the least, if the resulting political fallout from Mr Comey's decision - which Ms Clinton's campaign believes dealt a mortal wound - is used by Mr Barr to defend a decision to keep confidential damaging details of the Mueller investigation involving Donald Trump. His letter concludes: ""I remain committed to as much transparency as possible, and I will keep you informed as to the status of my review."" It's certainly a possibility. Or if we do learn something, it could take a while to render it into a form for public consumption (or, given the way things work in Washington, to leak). Imagine the scene in Washington, as the political world learns Mr Mueller has provided his findings to Mr Barr and then waits - for hours, days - to learn what, if anything, will come of it. There is another possibility, however. Up until now, Mr Mueller has spoken through his court filings, which are rich in detail and new revelations. While Mr Mueller's report to the attorney general will be confidential, it may not be his final word at the conclusion of his investigations. There may be more indictments to come. This video can not be played Mueller is done... this is what we know so far Over the course of the last 21 months, Mr Mueller - in his prosecutorial documents - has explained how Russian agents and operatives allegedly gathered information about the US political process, initiated a social media campaign to influence and enflame American political views, funded on-the-ground political activities, and hacked the emails and files of top Democratic operatives in an effort to damage Mrs Clinton's presidential campaign. He has prosecuted multiple members of the president's inner campaign circle for a variety of misdeeds, including obstruction of justice and lying about Russian contacts. He helped strike a deal with Mr Trump's personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, which unearthed evidence of Trump business negotiations with Russian officials conducted in the heat of the 2016 presidential campaign.

"Robert Mueller's report goes first to the attorney general, who will decide how much to release to the public It's been 22 months since former FBI Director Robert Mueller was appointed to head a special investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and whether the Trump campaign was involved. Now his work is done and his report has been submitted to the Department of Justice. But what does that mean? Time Magazine senior editor Ryan Teague Beckwith has described trying to keep up with the twists in the Mueller investigation as akin to understanding the plot of a Russian novel by listening to a book club conversation. Now, at last, perhaps we will see the full manuscript. Or at least the CliffsNotes (that's York Notes to you Brits). Or maybe we won't. If it all seems confusing, that's because no-one knows exactly what happens next. It doesn't mean we'll know all the details immediately - or ever. The notoriously tight-lipped former FBI director could simply announce that his work is done, pack his bags and go back to a private life of golf clubs, corporate boards, academic speaking engagements and trips to the Apple store Genius Bar. Not necessarily. In fact, probably not. It doesn't seem likely there will be a detailed investigative narrative presented to the public similar to the multi-tome report produced by Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr back in 1998. Boxes and boxes of the Starr report Mr Starr's wide-ranging investigation that started with a real-estate inquiry and ended up scouring Bill Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky was governed by a federal statute with different rules. And Mr Starr himself - a former judge and Republican administration lawyer - was a different kind of man to the by-the-books ex-Marine Mueller. Mr Mueller's probe is conducted under the auspices of the Justice Department and isgoverned by its regulations,external. The special counsel's obligations at the conclusion of his work are to provide a ""confidential report"" to Attorney General Bill Barr explaining his prosecutorial decisions. The Trump-Russia saga in 250 words What does the special counsel do? Mr Barr must then provide the top members of the Senate and House Judiciary committees with a brief explanation of any actions taken - or instances where he overruled the special counsel's proposed action. It is up to the attorney general to decide whether it would be in the ""public interest"" to make any of these reports or communications accessible to the rest of us. This is the million-dollar question. In his testimony during his January Senate confirmation hearings, Mr Barr was repeatedly pressed by Democrats to promise he would make public any findings or reports produced by the Mueller investigation. He demurred. Now, in his just-released letter to senior members of Congress, the attorney general seems eager to tell us more. ""I am reviewing the report and anticipate that I may be in a position to advise you of the Special Counsel's principal conclusions as soon as this weekend,"" he writes.

"The life stories of the Christchurch mosque victims are a striking reflection of a world in turmoil - one marked by war, poverty and economic inequality. In New Zealand, many thought they had found a safe, remote corner of Earth on which to build new lives. That changed last Friday at 13:40 when a gunman casually opened fire. ""I was so happy that I had a beautiful country to raise my kids in,"" says Mazharuddin Syed Ahmed, a survivor of those attacks. ""This really hurts me."" In the week since 50 lives were abruptly taken, Christchurch has come together with powerful messages of unity. For many here, this has opened their eyes to a diverse and complex community they previously gave little attention. But it is also a reminder of how easy it is for hatred to proliferate and then explode - and a closer look at the stories of those who attended the mosques last Friday is also a stark portrait of just how fragile their worlds had always been. Khaled Mustafa, 44, and his son Hamza, 16, were refugees. They had escaped the war in Syria along with three other family members. The family had spent time in Jordan at first, before they were accepted under New Zealand's refugee resettlement programme. They naturally assumed New Zealand was a safe place and had been there for less than a year when they were killed at the Al Noor mosque on Deans Avenue, the site of the first of the two attacks. Abo Ali, a Syrian man who moved to New Zealand in 1990, says he met the family just once but they were ""so happy to have a better life"". ""They run away from the death, and they die here,"" Mr Ali tells the BBC. Hamza's younger brother, Zaid, was also at the mosque. He survived, but was injured. He attended the funeral of his father and brother on Wednesday in a wheelchair, after surgery. ""I shouldn't be standing in front of you. I should be lying beside you,"" he was reportedly heard muttering at their graveside. Abo Ali says the support of New Zealanders has helped the community through the past week Mr Ali says the news hit the local Syrian and Muslim communities hard. ""But after, when we see the New Zealand people's support, and when we see the Christian people in New Zealand too, their support - believe me, we forget about our problem."" In many ways, 24-year-old Ansi Alibava's path to New Zealand was an unlikely one. She was born in Kerala, India, and not into a wealthy family. After her father died in Saudi Arabia, where he had been working, she began looking after the family, aged just 18. Her husband Abdul Nazer says that when they first met, he was struck by how she was ""supporting everything"". The couple had migrated from India a year ago to pursue her dream of studying and travelling overseas. It had been his dream to make hers a reality, he said. It was only when his father agreed to pledge his house for a loan that the pair were able to get to New Zealand. It was the first time either had even been outside of Kerala. After securing jobs in Christchurch they had been supporting both families at home. Mr Nazer can only manage a few words as he describes the bliss they shared in New Zealand. She loved her studies, he says, sitting in a room at Christchurch's Lincoln University where she was working towards a masters degree in agricultural engineering. She had recently begun an internship. He had just been telling his cousin Fahad Ismail Ponnath, who was there to support him, how the campus brought back so many ""lovely memories"" - rooms they had been in together, places they had walked. But last Friday the couple went to the Al Noor mosque as usual, going their own ways into the male and female areas. Abdul Nazer (left) said his wife had room in her heart for all people When the gunfire erupted, Mr Nazer fled the building and leapt over a fence into a nearby property. The owner of that house initially didn't let him in ""thinking that he was one of the terrorists maybe,"" Mr Ponnath says. But he soon left the safety of that house to look for his wife, and he found her lying motionless on a street. As he moved towards her, calling out, other survivors intervened to tell him she had died. Soon the police were there, moving everyone, including her husband, away. In limited English, Mr Nazer, 34, says of his wife: ""She's a really lovely person. Very kindly."" ""She loved all people,"" he says. ""Cousins, friends. She kept a big space in her mind [for] family members. Especially my father and my mother, my brothers."" Mr Nazer doesn't know for sure whether he'll remain in New Zealand, but it is likely, as he is now committed to supporting Ms Alibava's family - they have no breadwinners left. On Wednesday, flowers and tributes were starting to pile up outside Mohammed Imran Khan's takeaway shop, Indian Grill. Mr Khan, also known among friends as Imran Bhai, died in the Linwood mosque. Originally from India, he was an immensely popular figure in Christchurch. ""It's just been an absolutely overwhelming [amount] of texts and messages or communications from people I don't even know - just saying what a lovely man he was,"" his wife Tracey says. ""I knew that people loved him, not so much to this extent, I think. He was a very known man throughout the community for just his heart and giving of time and everything else."" Who were the victims of the mosque shootings? She is focused on looking after their teenage son, as well as her husband's relatives. ""It's very difficult being over the other side of the world and hearing this, and not having information,"" she says, with relatives arriving from around the world. Having spent much of his life in his native India and then Saudi Arabia, Mazharuddin Syed Ahmed says he ""couldn't comprehend"" how safe and inclusive New Zealand was when he arrived. This video can not be played Mazharuddin Syed Ahmed: ""We were all praying... and I heard gunshots"" He used to tell his friends overseas: ""You're scared to death to go to airports. Here, we love the airport. It's like fun - we enjoy it, it's like a pleasure trip for us. Because this country's safe."" Mr Syed Ahmed says the Linwood mosque was home to a small and close community. ""We really love to go on Friday and we were praying,"" he says, emphasising the final word. He cannot believe what happened to him and his friends in the country he regards as the greatest on Earth. Mr Syed Ahmed says he froze when he heard three gunshots interrupting Friday prayers. Abdul Aziz has been hailed a hero for taking on the gunman at the Linwood mosque People continued briefly to pray but his ears ""were completely focused - there is something happening"". Then, he says, one man started yelling: ""Take cover, take cover - move, move, move."" Despite hearing shots, he ran straight towards the main door - he doesn't know why - and took cover in a storage space next to door when the gunman came in. He believes he was saved by another worshipper, Abdul Aziz, who took on the attacker by hurling a credit card machine at him. ""But that time, I saw my friend right in my line of sight,"" Mr Syed Ahmed says. ""[A] big splash of blood was on the wall - I could see that he had died there."" The dozens of victims largely began their lives outside New Zealand, in South Asia and the Middle East, in Somalia or Fiji, Malaysia and Indonesia. Linda Armstrong's family say her last act was saving a friend in the mosque Linda Armstrong, 64, was a New Zealander but her life had been far from conventional, her nephew Kyron Gosse says. At one point, as ""a bit of a hippy"", she had lived on Waiheke Island near her home city of Auckland ""in this little hut in the middle of the bush with only a long drop [toilet] and no shower"", he says. At other times, she had settled in lofts and granny flats, ridden a motorbike, and travelled extensively - once living in Berlin. Always curious, she found Islam in 2011 while volunteering in a refugee centre in Auckland and talking to people there. ""She'd want to know - why? What do you believe?"" Mr Gosse says. ""And as she found out more and more about Islam, she told me: 'These are really beautiful people and this religion really resonates with me'."" He describes his aunt as ""a kind of outrageous character"" who had always been rebellious and a bit stubborn. She brought her stubbornness to the mosque. Following one conversation with a younger relative, she took issue with the plastic waste being generated there - so she went out and bought everyone reusable plates. She rarely had much money but was endlessly generous. Despite living on welfare payments, she began donating NZ$50 (Â£25; $34) per month to a refugee family from Syria. ""She never met them, she just heard about it and thought: what can I do?"" Mr Gosse says. Ms Armstrong ""wasn't in the best of health"", so she was seated at the back of the mosque when the violence came. That didn't stop her moving quickly to protect others. ""She put herself in front of one of her friends, took the bullet, and then died in her arms with the imam saying a prayer over her,"" Mr Gosse tells the BBC. ""We're all pretty proud that that was the sort of person she was."" Across Christchurch this week, locals have been comparing the collective trauma to an earthquake that struck the city in 2011, killing 185 people. It is, many say, a similar pain although they are fully aware that this particular pain has been inflicted by a person, and on a specific community. After an earthquake, a city can rebuild - a physical healing of its wounds. One victim, Zakaria Bhuiya was part of that process. He had moved to Christchurch from Bangladesh to work on the post-quake rebuild, according to the Indian Social and Cultural Club. Mr Bhuiya, a welder, had taken annual leave on Friday to celebrate his 33rd birthday with friends at the Al Noor mosque. ""He lived on the bare basics in order to maximise the money he could send home to support his family,"" his employer AMT Mechanical said. He leaves behind a wife in Bangladesh, Rina Akter. He had no family in Christchurch, but in the days it took officials to identify his body, the friends he had made staged a small protest outside the mosque. ""Our brother is missing, give us some information,"" read one sign. At times in this city of about 400,000 people it feels like everyone knew a victim, or knows someone who did. Peter Higgins, 67, says cardiologist Amjad Hamid had convinced him to retire following ""a heart attack"" and subsequent complications. Peter Higgins says Amjad Hamid had saved many people during his life ""That bloke really turned my life around,"" he says of Dr Hamid, a 57-year-old Palestinian who migrated decades ago. ""He got shot. And I think, how many people has he saved? And someone decides to play out with a gun."" The tragedy has made many think more deeply about the Muslim community here. Clare Needham, 72, says Daoud Nabi - the first of the dead to be identified - would turn up frequently to a charity shop where she volunteered, and would haggle over items. Daoud Nabi was the first of the victims to be formally named Mr Nabi, 70, told her of his deep love for his grandson. It was only this week that she learned the kind of profile he had within the community. Born in Afghanistan but a long-time New Zealand resident, he was president of a local Afghan association and a known supporter of other migrant groups. This video can not be played Farid Ahmed: ""I have forgiven him and I will pray for him"" One visitor to the tributes, Dave Palmer, was struck by the tolerance of Farid Ahmed, whose wife was killed in the attack, yet who told reporters he had forgiven the shooter. ""I thought: I don't know whether I could ever do that,"" says Mr Palmer, a Christian. ""That takes an amazing amount of strength and courage."" The kind of tolerance personified by Farid Ahmed and Linda Armstrong stands in stark contrast to the gunman and the online communities through which material allegedly posted by him spread. Australian Brenton Tarrant, 28, a self-described white supremacist, has been charged with murder. The gunman live-streamed the massacre on Facebook and a person suspected to be him posted a 65,000-word document online, outlining the alleged reasons for the attacks. As many have pointed out since, it was littered with coded references that sought to engage specific online communities. It was posted on 8chan - a forum favoured by the alt-right. It showed just how easy it is for intolerance and hate to ignite in such forums, unlike in the wider community, where tolerance is patiently built up over time. Ultimately, it took just one man and 17 minutes - in the case of the Al Noor attack - to shatter dozens of carefully built, second-chance lives. This video can not be played A comic is asking searching questions about race relations in the wake of the attack Questions have been raised since the attacks about whether forums should be better monitored for evidence of extremism, but experts say this would be challenging for a few reasons - not least the sheer volume of posts. ""We told them our fears about the rise of the alt-right. And the government has not responded adequately,"" says Anjum Rahman, of the Islamic Women's Council of New Zealand, who says she has been pleading with successive governments to address discrimination. Ms Rahman is also sharply critical of the media. ""Where were you?"" she says, arguing there was not enough scrutiny globally. Australia soul-searches after Christchurch Ardern calls for global anti-racism fight How prevalent is far-right extremism? Paul Hunt, New Zealand's chief human rights commissioner, says it has one of the world's best human rights records although it does see Islamophobia, racism and hate crimes in ""some sectors of society"". But if the gunman -whose name Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has sworn she will never speak- had wanted to tear New Zealand apart, judging from the past week he has failed. On Thursday,the prime minister announced a wide-ranging crackdown on New Zealand's gun laws- including banning all the types of weapons used in the attacks. Ardern: 'A leader with love on full display' How mass killings have changed gun laws What are New Zealand's gun laws? Unlike after attacks in the US, for example, it's been almost universally well-received - some people had begun turning in their guns before the ban was even announced. The past week has seen a constant stream of tributes from New Zealanders of all ages and backgrounds Again and again, locals say they are determined to pull together and ensure this tragedy is not repeated. ""I'm trying to process grief but also anger: how dare he do this to us?"" says Cara Butler, 38. ""But I think he's picked the wrong place - I think he's going to see the opposite of what he thought. He's not going to create division, it's going to create community and more cohesion."" Mr Syed Ahmed, the survivor, says his two children ""have New Zealand, Kiwi values - and I'm so happy with that"". But he fears for them, saying all nations - not just New Zealand - must not become complacent. ""Now I see that people can come to the remotest, peaceful corner of Earth,"" he says. ""This just can't happen to this country. You can't leave it just as another incident. We're [travelling] as far as the Moon and Mars, but our neighbourhoods aren't safe for our kids?

"Brexit's fate is ""in the hands of our British friends"" after EU leaders agreed to delay the departure date by at least two weeks, says Donald Tusk. If MPs approve Theresa May's withdrawal deal next week, Brexit would be delayed from 29 March until 22 May. But if they do not, the UK has until 12 April to come up with a new plan. European Council President Mr Tusk said that until 12 April, ""anything is possible"" including a much longer delay or cancelling Brexit altogether. Speaking in Brussels on Friday, he said he was ""really happy"" the 27 EU leaders had reached a unanimous decision to extend the two-year Article 50 process, under which the UK was due to leave the EU next Friday. MPs set to vote on alternative Brexit plans Nick Robinson podcast: Greg Clark says PM need big majority Nigel Farage back as Brexit Party leader Brexit: What just happened? ""It means that until 12 April, anything is possible: a deal, a long extension if the United Kingdom decided to rethink its strategy, or revoking Article 50, which is a prerogative of the UK government. ""The fate of Brexit is in the hands of our British friends. As the EU, we are prepared for the worst, but hope for the best. As you know, hope dies last."" According to thefinal summit conclusions,external, the UK is expected to ""indicate a way forward"" before 12 April, if MPs do not approve the withdrawal deal negotiated with the EU, which would then be considered by the European Council. Theresa May has been granted a little breathing space. The EU has allowed a few more days to try to get her deal through the House of Commons. But it's not the timetable that she chose. And as things stand, the expectation that the compromise deal will get through is low. And, more to the point, the government does not believe that it can hold off another attempt by a powerful cross-party group of MPs who are resolved to put Parliament forcibly in charge of the process to find alternatives. Ministers are therefore today not just wondering about how to manage one last heave for the prime minister's deal, but what they should do next, when - odds on - the whole issue is in the hands of the Commons, not Number 10. Read Laura's blog The UK must decide by then whether it will be taking part in European Parliamentary elections from 23-26 May - if it does not, then a long delay would become ""impossible"", Mr Tusk said. On Friday, Mrs May's deputy David Lidington met opposition parties to discuss how MPs could vote on alternatives to the government's Brexit plan next week. These could include options such as holding another referendum, leaving with no deal or pursuing a closer economic arrangement such as the ""Common Market 2.0"" plan. MPs are expected to vote on Mrs May's deal for a third time next week,despite Commons Speaker John Bercow ruling that it could not be brought back for another vote without ""substantial"" changes. But in a letter to all MPs on Friday evening, Mrs May said it was possible a third vote on the deal may not take place ""if it appears there is not sufficient support to bring the deal back next week"". The prime minister offered to talk to MPs over the coming days ""as Parliament prepares to take momentous decisions"". She also referred to her televised address on Wednesday, in whichshe blamed the delay to Brexit on MPs. Mrs May acknowledged that ""a number of colleagues had raised concerns"" about her words and it had not been her intention to make a their ""difficult job... any more difficult"". Earlier, Business Secretary Greg Clark told the BBC that if they do not back Mrs May's deal, then the government would give Parliament the means to express their views on a series of other options. He said this meant an attempt by a cross-party group to enable MPs to take control of Commons business, so they can get indicative votes, would not be necessary. But he said the government's ambition should be to try to build as big a consensus as possible on Brexit, rather than simply ""getting it over the line"" with a slim majority of one or two votes. 29 March:Current Brexit date in UK law 12 April:If MPs do not approve the withdrawal deal next week - ""all options will remain open"" until this date. The UK must propose a way forward before this date for consideration by EU leaders 22 May:If MPs do approve the deal next week, Brexit will be delayed until this date 23-26 May:European Parliamentary elections are held across member states Mrs May has ruled out revoking Article 50, which would cancel Brexit, and has said it would be wrong to ask Britons to vote for candidates for the elections to the European Parliament, due to be held from 23-26 May, three years after they voted to leave the EU. Her official spokesman said: ""There is now a clear point of decision. If we are able to have a successful vote next week then we can pass the necessary legislation for ratifying the agreement and we can, as a country, be outside the European Union two months today."" For now, the UK's departure date is still written in to law as next Friday, 29 March. But Mrs May is expected to change that by tabling legislation next week and getting it through the Commons and the Lords. EU wins some Brexit breathing space Stop Brexit petition tops 3m signatures Brexitcast: Tres Spikey The withdrawal deal sets out the terms of the UK's departure from the bloc, including the ""divorce bill"", the transition period, citizens' rights and the controversial ""backstop"" arrangements, aimed at preventing a return to border checks between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. But it must be approved by UK MPs, who have already rejected it twice by large margins. The Irish premier Leo Varadkar said the choices were now obvious: ""It's this agreement, no deal, or the parliament taking indicative votes for a much closer long-term relationship with the EU."" But Nigel Dodds, deputy leader of the DUP - whose votes Mrs May relies on to support her minority government - said the prime minister had ""missed an opportunity"" to propose changes to the withdrawal agreement to help get it through the Commons. ""The prime minister has now agreed with the EU to kick the can down the road for another two weeks and humiliatingly revoke her oft-stated pledge that the UK would leave the EU on 29 March,"" he said.

"President Donald Trump (left) has criticised Robert Mueller's (right) investigation as a ""witch hunt"" Special Counsel Robert Mueller has submitted his long-awaited report on alleged collusion between Russia and President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign. A justice department official said Mr Mueller's report did not recommend any further indictments. Six former Trump aides and a dozen Russians already face unrelated charges in connection with the investigation. The Attorney General William Barr will now summarise the report and decide how much to share with Congress. Mr Barr told congressional leaders in a letter that he anticipated being able to inform them of the report's key findings over the weekend. What might 'Mueller report' look like? Trump Russia: The saga in 250 words Who's who in the drama to end all dramas? The report is intended to explain any prosecutorial decisions the special counsel has made in the 22 months since his appointment by deputy US Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. Mr Trump and other Republicans have repeatedly condemned the probe as a ""witch hunt"". This video can not be played Mueller is done... this is what we know In his letter to Congress' judiciary committee leaders - Senators Lindsey Graham and Dianne Feinstein and Congressmen Jerrold Nadler and Doug Collins - Mr Barr confirmed there were no instances during the investigation where the Department of Justice had interfered with Mr Mueller's work. The attorney general said he will now consult with Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein - who managed the inquiry prior to Mr Barr's appointment - and Mr Mueller ""to determine what other information from the report can be released to Congress and the public"". ""I remain committed to as much transparency as possible, and I will keep you informed as to the status of my review,"" he said. Over the past 22 months, the special counsel has revealed how Russian agents and operatives allegedly obtained information about US elections to initiate a campaign to influence Americans, fund political activities in the US and hack emails of top Democrats to undermine Hillary Clinton's campaign. Who is special counsel Robert Mueller? What does the special counsel do? Key questions answered in the Trump Russia probe Mr Mueller was also investigating whether Mr Trump obstructed justice with his firing of FBI director James Comey, or by trying to mislead or end the inquiry. Mr Trump has repeatedly said there was ""no collusion"" with Russia and ""no obstruction"". The president refused to sit for an interview with Mr Mueller's team during the inquiry, but his lawyers submitted written answers to questions after months of negotiating terms. Is this how the Mueller investigation ends? Not with a bang, but with a letter? The details of the final report have yet to be disclosed, but because Attorney General Barr has said there were no instances where he or his predecessors overrode the special counsel's prosecutorial decisions - and no new indictments have been announced - it seems possible that what we have seen with the criminal portion of the probe is what we're going to get. There may still be politically damaging revelations to come, but Donald Trump has shrugged off many a political threat in his rise to the White House. Without a criminal caseload directly related to ""collusion"" by members of the Trump campaign - the central thrust of the investigation - it seems certain the president and his White House surrogates will shout from the hilltops that their side has been exonerated. This is far from the end of legal jeopardy for the president, his family, his aides and his business empire, of course. Investigations at both the state and federal level into various financial and campaign finance violations grind on, not to mention the aggressive oversight coming down the pipe from the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives. After today's developments, however, the president will continue to claim he is the victim of an unfounded ""witch hunt"". His political adversaries, who were hoping for a courtroom coup de grace, will be left searching for a new silver bullet. This video can not be played How US networks reacted to Mueller news White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said in a statement: ""The next steps are up to Attorney General Barr and we look forward to the process taking its course. The White House has not received or been briefed on the Special Counsel's report."" Mr Trump's personal lawyers Rudy Giuliani and Jay Sekulow echoed a similar sentiment, saying they were ""pleased"" the report had been delivered and trust Mr Barr to ""determine the appropriate next steps"". Mr Nadler, a New York Democrat, acknowledged the investigation had concluded on Twitter, saying: ""We look forward to getting the full Mueller report and related materials."" Allow Twitter content?

Earlier this month, the House of Representatives voted unanimously for a resolution demanding the Department of Justice release the full report to the public, signalling support within both parties to find out whether Mr  Mueller discovered any criminal wrongdoing. Speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer also called for transparency in a joint statement, adding that the White House ""must not be allowed to interfere"". ""The Special Counsel's investigation focused on questions that go to the integrity of our democracy itself: whether foreign powers corruptly interfered in our elections, and whether unlawful means were used to hinder that investigation.  The American people have a right to the truth."" Mr Graham, a South Carolina Republican and vocal Trump supporter, said he ""always believed it was important that Mr Mueller be allowed to do his job without interference, and that has been accomplished"". What happens next is in Mr Barr's hands. Legally, the attorney general is under no obligation to release the report publicly, and his copy to Congress could contain redactions, but during his confirmation hearings before senators he vowed to release as much as he could. And if he does provide Congress with the full details, members could leak the report to the public. Seven legal headaches for the president With the 2020 presidential elections looming, candidates are expected to campaign with promises of making the full report public. Many of the Democratic hopefuls - Beto O'Rourke, Bernie Sanders, Cory Booker, Amy Klobuchar, Kirsten Gillibrand, and Julian Castro - have called for the full release of the report.

"What now? Theresa May has been granted a little breathing space. The EU has allowed a few more days to try to get her deal through the House of Commons. But it's not the timetable that she chose. And as things stand, the expectation that the compromise deal will get through is low. And, more to the point, the government does not believe that it can hold off another attempt by a powerful cross-party group of MPs who are resolved to put Parliament forcibly in charge of the process to find alternatives. Ministers are therefore today not just wondering about how to manage one last heave for the prime minister's deal, but what they should do next, when - odds on - the whole issue is in the hands of the Commons, not Number 10. Brexit pushed back by at least two weeks EU wins some Brexit breathing space Brexit: What just happened? Brexitcast - TrÃ¨s Spikey Within days, MPs will push for a series of votes on different versions of Brexit - the ""Norway"" model, another referendum, Labour's version of Brexit with a customs union, the list goes on. But here's the dilemma. Does Theresa May just wait for Parliament to do what one minister describes as ""grab control of the order paper""? Or should they instead try to lead the process, forcing what another member of the cabinet described as a ""fresh start"", even though it seems ""ludicrous"" to be resetting the whole process in this way at this stage? Some in the government believe the best choice is to take charge of this next stage - to lead the process as Parliament and the opposition parties try to find a new compromise. Sounds like a no brainer. But there is a real hesitation over whether the Labour frontbench are really interested in trying to find a compromise or will, ultimately, be too tempted by the political opportunity of pulling the rug from under the government at the very last minute. And given that the majority of MPs are, theoretically, in favour of a softer Brexit than the one the prime minister has negotiated, could Theresa May really preside over a process that would end up there? But if the government sits back and just lets Parliament get on with it, then Number 10 accepts becoming a passenger - entirely in the hands of the MPs whose behaviour the prime minister so reviled in thatcontroversial address in Number 10 on Wednesday night. Don't forget - for many Brexiteers in the Conservative Party, the idea of a softer Brexit than the one the prime minister has negotiated is nothing short of an abomination. (That could, in a hypothetical world, mean that more of them are willing to back Theresa May's deal than currently expected - if it is the ""hardest"" brexit that is on offer). So for Theresa May's survival as leader of the Conservative Party, there is a case, strange as it sounds, for her to hang back from leading the next phase. If Parliament chooses a softer Brexit in the end, it could suit Mrs May not to have her fingerprints on it. But is it really a tenable leadership strategy, choosing not to lead? Brexit has done some very strange things to our political process. The reality is though, if Theresa May next week accepts the will of Parliament and it is ""soft Brexit"", the reaction from the Conservative Party could be explosive. Frankly, the choices for Theresa May are running out. Many Tories on all sides of the debate are deeply alarmed by how things have unravelled in the last few days. One senior, influential, MP who has been studiously loyal to the prime minister is incandescent, saying that she has ""angered all the people whose support she needed"", and that ""she is the most stubborn and ill-suited person for this job"". Another former minister suggests Theresa May's deal still could pass, but only if she tempts Labour rebels across with a promise of a referendum to give the public the chance to rubber stamp it, or ""we'll have a new PM with a new plan"", and maybe soon. One current member of the government says ""only Number Ten can't see that she is on her way out"". Another minister says the situation is ""super dangerous"". All of the fundamental factors that have preserved her so far remain - there is no obvious alternative plan that is certain to get a majority of MPs on side. There is no obvious leader in waiting that the whole Conservative Party would gladly choose. The Labour Party have their own battles with their own divisions over Brexit. The traditional claim of TINA - There Is No Alternative - has helped Theresa May hang on. But now an alternative to her deal is likely to be forced upon her, one that could make her leadership impossible to maintain. Theresa May arrives back in Number 10 today having won a little bit of extra time, but she has less and less space to breathe.

"A petition on Parliament's website calling for Brexit to be cancelled has now passed more than 5.7m signatures. The petition to revoke the Article 50 withdrawal process has gained more than one million signatures since Saturday's march calling for a new EU referendum. Theresa May has stressed that the UK had already decided to leave the EU in the biggest ever democratic exercise. But European Council chief Donald Tusk has said revoking Brexit was an option if MPs again rejected the PM's deal. Brexit debate: Do petitions ever work? Why bots probably aren't gaming the 'Cancel Brexit' petition Can the UK revoke Article 50? Death threats for Brexit petition woman The UK has to decide its next move by 12 April after the EU agreed a planto delay Brexit beyond 29 March. The prime minister hopes to bring the agreement she has negotiated with the EU back to the Commons for the third time but MPs want other options to be considered as well - and onMonday backed a series of votesto find out the kind of Brexit deal they would support. In December, the European Court of Justice ruled that the UK can unilaterally revoke Article 50 of the Treaty of the European Union, the clause which allows a country to leave the bloc. This means the UK can decide to stay in the EU without the consent of the 27 other member states. Lib Dem MP Layla Moran has said the petition could ""give oxygen"" to the campaign for another Brexit referendum, a so-called People's Vote. However, speaking on Thursday night after the petition reached the two-million mark, Mrs May said the public had already had their say on EU membership. ""They voted in 2016, they voted to leave. I think the time is now to deliver for the British people, the time is now to make the decision,"" she said. Please upgrade your browser Use the list below or select a button People signing petitions on the Parliament website are asked to tick a box saying they are a British citizen or UK resident and to confirm their name, email address and postcode to sign. The petition was started in February and quickly passed the 100,000-signature threshold needed for it to be debated in Parliament. It began to attract thousands of more signatures last week and at one stage caused the petition website to crash. It reached four million signatures on Saturday, ashundreds of thousands of people marched in central London, making it the most popular to have been submitted to the parliament website. A petition for a second EU referendum in June 2016 attracted more than four million signatures and was debated in the Commons - but thousands of signatures were removed after it wasdiscovered to have been hijacked by automated bots. In January, MPsdebated whether the UK should leave the EU without a deal,after a petition calling for that got 137,731 signatures.

"Mr Trump tweeted that ""large-scale"" sanctions had been withdrawn US President Donald Trump has not ordered the withdrawal of recently imposed sanctions against North Korea, administration officials say. Mr Trump caused confusion on Friday when he tweeted that ""additional large-scale sanctions"" would be withdrawn. It was thought he was referring to the treasury's move to blacklist two China-based shipping companies suspected of illegally trading with North Korea. But officials later said he was referring to future sanctions. Citing unnamed administration officials, US media reported that Mr Trump was in fact cancelling measures that had yet to be announced and were scheduled for the coming days. What to make of the Hanoi summit collapse? US threw away 'golden opportunity' - N Korea North Korea crisis in 300 words It had been thought that his tweet was referring to sanctions announced by the Treasury on Thursday. Mr Trump sowed further confusion by referring to sanctions he said had been announced on Friday. The confusion appeared to highlight differences within the Trump administration on how the US should approach relations with Pyongyang. While the White House said the president felt the sanctions were unnecessary, National Security Adviser John Bolton said Thursday's treasury sanctions were ""important"". In a tweet, he wrote that ""the maritime industry must do more to stop North Korea's illicit shipping practices"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Just hours after the announcement,North Korea withdrew from the inter-Korean liaison office. It was not clear if the two events were connected, and Pyongyang did not comment on the latest sanctions. The liaison office, located in the North Korean border city of Kaesong, had allowed officials from North and South Korea to communicate on a regular basis for the first time since the Korean War. The North Korean pullout followed a failed summit between President Trump and North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un in Hanoi, Vietnam, last month.

"Theresa May has told MPs there might not be a third vote on her Brexit deal next week if there is insufficient support for it to pass. If it does not pass, the EU has set a deadline of 12 April for the UK to propose a new plan. Supporters of another EU referendum are due to march through central London later. Labour's Tom Watson will speak at the event, pledging to back May's deal if she agrees to hold a referendum on it. Meanwhile, an online petition calling for the UK to remain in the EU has attracted a record number of signatures. By 11:32 GMT, the total number of signatures calling for Article 50 to be revoked stood at 4,151,815 - beating the previous record reached by another Brexit-related petition in 2016. If Mrs May's deal is approved by MPs next week, the EU has agreed to extend the Brexit deadline until 22 May. If it is not - and no alternative plan is put forward - the UK is set to leave the EU on 12 April. In a letter to all MPs on Friday evening,Mrs May offered to talk to MPs over the coming days ""as Parliament prepares to take momentous decisions"". She said there were now four ""clear choices"". These were: Approving her deal next week - which relies on Commons Speaker John Bercow allowing her to put it to MPs to vote on again,which he has ruled will not be allowed unless ""substantial"" changes are made to it Asking for another extension before 12 April - which would mean the UK would have to take part in elections for the European Parliament Revoking Article 50 - cancelling Brexit - which Mrs May said would ""betray the result of the referendum"" Leaving with no deal Children's minister Nadhim Zahawi told the Today programme failing to support Mrs May's deal would lead to a ""meltdown in our politics, not just for the Conservative party but for all parties"". He said all the other alternatives would require MPs asking for a much longer extension, which Mrs May has said she is not prepared for. Ministers 'divided' on Brexit votes process Brexit's fate in British hands, says Tusk Brexit: What just happened? Why bots probably aren't gaming the 'Cancel Brexit' petition Indicating he would stand down if Mrs May's deal is not voted for, Mr Zahawi said he ""cannot justify"" going to his constituents and saying: ""We failed to deliver this and that now we are having to stay in the EU and go into European elections."" Mrs May also confirmed in her letter that the government would change the law to officially change the UK's departure date from the EU next week. Theresa May said asking for an extension was a matter ""of great personal regret"" Her letter came after the DUP - whose support will be crucial if the government is to win - indicated they still would not back her deal. Mrs May also referred to her televised address on Wednesday, in whichshe blamed the delay to Brexit on MPs. She acknowledged that ""a number of colleagues had raised concerns"" about her words and said it had not been her intention to make their ""difficult job... any more difficult"". Former Tory chief whip Andrew Mitchell told BBC Radio 4's Today programme ""there was a very strong feeling she'd made an error of judgement"" on this. This video can not be played Theresa May's televised address, blaming MPs for a delay, caused anger in Westminster But dismissing reports of growing pressure on Mrs May to quit, he said: ""To change prime minister would be a colossal error - it won't change the numbers [in the vote for Mrs May's deal]"". By Jonathan Blake, political correspondent Theresa May's admission that there may not be a third vote on her deal after all will focus minds on what an alternative plan might be. To avoid asking the EU for a longer extension and holding European parliament elections, the prime minister will need a new course of action. A series ofindicative votesin Parliament looks the most likely way to decide that - but there is no agreement on whether the government should lead that process or relinquish control to Parliament. And when and if a consensus in Parliament emerges, there is no guarantee it will automatically become government policy. It has taken two years for the government to formulate, negotiate and attempt to get a Brexit deal through Parliament. Finding an alternative which ministers, MPs and the EU are happy to embrace within the next two weeks will be a very tough task indeed. Meanwhile, campaigners say they expect hundreds of thousands of people to march through central London as part of the 'Put It To The People' demonstration. Speakers at a rally afterwards will include Labour's deputy leader, Tom Watson, Scotland's First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, London Mayor Sadiq Khan and others. Mr Watson will say: ""I've come to the reluctant view that the only way to resolve this and have legitimacy in the eyes of the public is for the people themselves to sign it off."" James McGrory, the Director of the People's Vote campaign, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""Politicians are unable to agree on a way forward so it seems to the People's Vote campaign that the only way forward it to put any Brexit deal - whether it's the government's deal or any alternative form of Brexit - put it to the people."" Ms Sturgeon said now was ""the moment of maximum opportunity""to avoid a no-deal Brexit. A petition on Parliament's website calling for Brexit to be cancelled by revoking Article 50 has attracted more than four million signatures. Lib Dem MP Layla Moran said the petition could ""give oxygen"" to the campaign for another Brexit referendum. Speaking in Brussels on Friday after the European Council agreed to delay the Brexit date, Mr Tusk said that until 12 April, ""anything is possible"" including a much longer delay or cancelling Brexit altogether. ""The fate of Brexit is in the hands of our British friends. As the EU, we are prepared for the worst, but hope for the best. As you know, hope dies last."" European Council President Donald Tusk, left, with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker According to thefinal summit conclusions,external, the UK is expected to ""indicate a way forward"" before 12 April, if MPs do not approve the withdrawal deal negotiated with the EU, which would then be considered by the European Council. The UK must decide by then whether it will take part in European Parliamentary elections from 23-26 May - if it does not, then a long delay would become ""impossible"", Mr Tusk said. Mrs May will need to table secondary legislation to remove the date March 29 from Brexit laws. 29 March:Current Brexit date in UK law 12 April:If MPs do not approve the withdrawal deal next week - ""all options will remain open"" until this date.

"Mr Trump tweeted that ""large-scale"" sanctions had been withdrawn US President Donald Trump has not ordered the withdrawal of recently imposed sanctions against North Korea, administration officials say. Mr Trump caused confusion on Friday when he tweeted that ""additional large-scale sanctions"" would be withdrawn. It was thought he was referring to the treasury's move to blacklist two China-based shipping companies suspected of illegally trading with North Korea. But officials later said he was referring to future sanctions. Citing unnamed administration officials, US media reported that Mr Trump was in fact cancelling measures that had yet to be announced and were scheduled for the coming days. What to make of the Hanoi summit collapse? US threw away 'golden opportunity' - N Korea North Korea crisis in 300 words It had been thought that his tweet was referring to sanctions announced by the Treasury on Thursday. Mr Trump sowed further confusion by referring to sanctions he said had been announced on Friday. The confusion appeared to highlight differences within the Trump administration on how the US should approach relations with Pyongyang. While the White House said the president felt the sanctions were unnecessary, National Security Adviser John Bolton said Thursday's treasury sanctions were ""important"". In a tweet, he wrote that ""the maritime industry must do more to stop North Korea's illicit shipping practices"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The US Treasury said it had acted because the companies had helped North Korea to evade international and US sanctions,externalby engaging in ship-to-ship transfers with North Korean tankers or exporting North Korean coal. Just hours after the announcement,North Korea withdrew from the inter-Korean liaison office. It was not clear if the two events were connected, and Pyongyang did not comment on the latest sanctions. The liaison office, located in the North Korean border city of Kaesong, had allowed officials from North and South Korea to communicate on a regular basis for the first time since the Korean War. The North Korean pullout followed a failed summit between President Trump and North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un in Hanoi, Vietnam, last month.

"Robert Mueller's report goes first to the attorney general, who will decide how much to release to the public It's been 22 months since former FBI Director Robert Mueller was appointed to head a special investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and whether the Trump campaign was involved. Now his work is done and his report has been submitted to the Department of Justice. But what does that mean? Time Magazine senior editor Ryan Teague Beckwith has described trying to keep up with the twists in the Mueller investigation as akin to understanding the plot of a Russian novel by listening to a book club conversation. Now, at last, perhaps we will see the full manuscript. Or at least the CliffsNotes (that's York Notes to you Brits). Or maybe we won't. If it all seems confusing, that's because no-one knows exactly what happens next. It doesn't mean we'll know all the details immediately - or ever. The notoriously tight-lipped former FBI director could simply announce that his work is done, pack his bags and go back to a private life of golf clubs, corporate boards, academic speaking engagements and trips to the Apple store Genius Bar. Not necessarily. In fact, probably not. It doesn't seem likely there will be a detailed investigative narrative presented to the public similar to the multi-tome report produced by Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr back in 1998. Boxes and boxes of the Starr report Mr Starr's wide-ranging investigation that started with a real-estate inquiry and ended up scouring Bill Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky was governed by a federal statute with different rules. And Mr Starr himself - a former judge and Republican administration lawyer - was a different kind of man to the by-the-books ex-Marine Mueller. Mr Mueller's probe is conducted under the auspices of the Justice Department and isgoverned by its regulations,external. The special counsel's obligations at the conclusion of his work are to provide a ""confidential report"" to Attorney General Bill Barr explaining his prosecutorial decisions. The Trump-Russia saga in 250 words What does the special counsel do? Mr Barr must then provide the top members of the Senate and House Judiciary committees with a brief explanation of any actions taken - or instances where he overruled the special counsel's proposed action. It is up to the attorney general to decide whether it would be in the ""public interest"" to make any of these reports or communications accessible to the rest of us. This is the million-dollar question. In his testimony during his January Senate confirmation hearings, Mr Barr was repeatedly pressed by Democrats to promise he would make public any findings or reports produced by the Mueller investigation. He demurred. Now, in his just-released letter to senior members of Congress, the attorney general seems eager to tell us more. ""I am reviewing the report and anticipate that I may be in a position to advise you of the Special Counsel's principal conclusions as soon as this weekend,"" he writes. Who's who in the drama to end all dramas? Five big things Mueller is looking at Traditionally the Justice Department has been reluctant to provide information about investigations that do not lead to criminal prosecution. That was a guideline notably violated by former FBI Director James Comey during his July 2016 press statement outlining the results of a federal investigation into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server while she was Barack Obama's secretary of state. It would be ironic, to say the least, if the resulting political fallout from Mr Comey's decision - which Ms Clinton's campaign believes dealt a mortal wound - is used by Mr Barr to defend a decision to keep confidential damaging details of the Mueller investigation involving Donald Trump. His letter concludes: ""I remain committed to as much transparency as possible, and I will keep you informed as to the status of my review."" It's certainly a possibility. Or if we do learn something, it could take a while to render it into a form for public consumption (or, given the way things work in Washington, to leak). Imagine the scene in Washington, as the political world learns Mr Mueller has provided his findings to Mr Barr and then waits - for hours, days - to learn what, if anything, will come of it. There is another possibility, however. Up until now, Mr Mueller has spoken through his court filings, which are rich in detail and new revelations. While Mr Mueller's report to the attorney general will be confidential, it may not be his final word at the conclusion of his investigations. There may be more indictments to come. This video can not be played Mueller is done... this is what we know so far Over the course of the last 21 months, Mr Mueller - in his prosecutorial documents - has explained how Russian agents and operatives allegedly gathered information about the US political process, initiated a social media campaign to influence and enflame American political views, funded on-the-ground political activities, and hacked the emails and files of top Democratic operatives in an effort to damage Mrs Clinton's presidential campaign. He has prosecuted multiple members of the president's inner campaign circle for a variety of misdeeds, including obstruction of justice and lying about Russian contacts. He helped strike a deal with Mr Trump's personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, which unearthed evidence of Trump business negotiations with Russian officials conducted in the heat of the 2016 presidential campaign. He indicted a Trump confidant, Roger Stone, for lying about his contacts with Wikileaks, the organisation he says was the conduit through which Russia injected its purloined material into the American political bloodstream. Former Trump adviser Roger Stone is among those indicted in connection with the inquiry The special counsel could be building a prosecutorial path that leads to the White House, with the final stones about to be set. Court-watchers note multiple sealed indictments have been filed in the federal courts used by Mr Mueller's team over the past few months. Those could be political and legal bombs, with their fuses lit. Or they could be duds. Hardly. Even if the Mueller investigation closes up shop and there is no ""report"", there are no new indictments and the attorney general's public pronouncements provide few details, it's not the end of the story. There are a number of cases initiated by the special counsel - involving Former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn and deputy campaign aide Rick Gates - that still await final sentencing. Former campaign chairman Paul Manafort has been jailed for fraud and for conspiracy related to illegal lobbying. Long-time Trump adviser Mr Stone has yet to go to trial on his charges of lying to Congress, witness tampering and obstruction of justice. Mr Mueller has handed this prosecution over to government lawyers. There's also a special counsel case against Concord Management and Consulting, which Mr Mueller has charged with assisting Russia's 2016 social media election-meddling campaign. Meanwhile there's a plethora of other ongoing investigations that are being run independently of the special counsel's office. Federal investigators in New York are looking into possible election-law violations by the Trump campaign and his businesses and misconduct by the Trump inaugural committee. The US attorneys in Washington and Virginia also have their hands full, with the espionage case involving Russian Maria Butina and an unregistered foreign lobbying prosecution of Mr Flynn's business associates. There are also state-level investigations of Mr Trump's charitable foundation and Trump Organization tax filings, as well as an ongoing lawsuit by Maryland and the District of Columbia alleging that the president, through his business dealings, is violating a constitutional rule prohibiting the acceptance of money from foreign governments while in office. Mr Mueller may exit the stage, but the drama will continue. Bernie Sanders runs for president again Bird steals the show at Sanders rally.

"James Gavin, Mick Murray and Michael Hayes were three of four men named by Witness O at the inquests A convicted IRA bomber has named four men he says were responsible for the 1974 Birmingham pub bombings. At inquests into the deaths of the 21 victims, ""Witness O"" named the men responsible as Seamus McLoughlin, Mick Murray, Michael Hayes and James Gavin. He said he had been given permission to reveal the names by the current head of the IRA in Dublin. The witness was part of an active service unit in the city, but was in prison at the time of the bombings. Speaking via video link he accepted the bombings were an ""atrocity"". Bombs detonated in the Mulberry Bush and the Tavern in the Town Seamus McLoughlin, who was also named by Witness O at the inquests, has since died Bombs exploded at the Mulberry Bush in the base of the city's Rotunda and the Tavern in the Town in nearby New Street. Witness O said he believed police had been given a warning that would have given adequate time to evacuate the busy pubs. He named Seamus McLoughlin as the officer commanding the Birmingham IRA at the time and said he was the person responsible for selecting the targets. He said Mick Murray was ""one of the bombers"" and claimed he recalled how Murray told him there would be ""no harm"" if similar bombings had been repeated, because of the ""chaos"" caused. When pressed by a lawyer for the bereaved families, he said Michael Hayes and James Gavin were also part of the team. Julie Hambleton's sister Maxine was killed in the Tavern in the Town All four men have been previously named in connection with the bombings, but not in a formal setting. In July 2017, Michael Hayes gave an interview to BBC News Northern Irelandin which he said he was part of the group responsible for the bombings. He said he was sorry innocent people had been killed. He refused to say who planted the bombs, but said he was speaking out to give ""the point of view of a participant"". The Birmingham pub bombings killed these 21 people in November 1974 At the inquests on Friday Mr Leslie Thomas QC asked Witness O whether a previously named suspect, Michael Patrick Reilly, had been involved. The witness said: ""No, I don't remember him at all. Reilly? I would remember that."" Mr Reilly has always denied any involvement in the bombings. Who were Birmingham pub bombings victims? Pub blasts 'IRA operation that went wrong' Latest news from the West Midlands The inquests previously heard the bombings were ""an IRA operation that went badly wrong"". The bombs killed 21 and injured 220 at the two pubs on 21 November 1974. Former IRA intelligence chief Kieran Conway had previously said the attacks were ""not sanctioned"" by the IRA and were ""accidental deaths"". The inquests were not supposed to address the issue of the identities of the bombers, but after being told that relatives had been in ""pain and suffering for the last 44 years"", Witness O agreed to name them. He said he would do so even though it could put his own life at risk from new dissident groups. As the names were given, many of the bereaved family members broke down in tears. Sheila Hunt, whose son Stephen Whalley was killed in the bombings, told the BBC she would like to know ""who was actually responsible"". This video can not be played Sheila Hunt's son Stephen Whalley died in the bombing Outside court, Julie Hambleton, whose sister Maxine was killed in the Tavern in the Town, said: ""Witness O has today named the bombers involved in the Birmingham pub bombings. ""I have a letter from David Thompson, chief constable of West Midlands Police, that says this is an on-going live investigation [and] as such we expect action. ""[We expect] information as a matter of urgency now as to what is going to happen, what, where and when."" A West Midlands Police spokesman said: ""The pub bombing investigation has never closed. ""Our approach is where new facts come to light, they are scrutinised to see if people can be brought to justice. ""The force will never lose sight of the tragic fact that 21 people lost their lives in the atrocities that took place in Birmingham in 1974. ""It's not appropriate to make further comment at this stage while we're in the middle of the coroner's inquests."" Phil Mackie, in court for BBC News When the Birmingham Coroner agreed in early 2016 that inquests could resume, Julie Hambleton - whose sister Maxine was killed - described it as ""seismic"". Today's surprise development felt equally dramatic. No-one was expecting it to happen. Julie and the relatives of a number of other victims were in tears when the names of the alleged bombers were read out, despite a legal ruling that appeared to rule out the possibility. The campaign group Justice for the 21 says it hopes West Midlands Police will follow up the evidence given by Witness O. Following the hearing, Ulster Unionist Assembly Member Doug Beattie, said: ""Given that numerous Sinn FÃ©in politicians have claimed that there is no IRA, you wonder just who is sitting in Dublin, claiming to be the head of it. ""The PSNI [Police Service of Northern Ireland] and the Garda need to give an assessment of this claim as a matter of urgency."" A Sinn FÃ©in spokesperson said: ""The IRA is gone and is not coming back."" The inquests continue.

"The email allegedly sent to Connor Scothern was said to be a ""masterpiece of back-covering"" Two men accused of being members of an illegal neo-Nazi group were urged to destroy evidence, a court has heard. Connor Scothern and Garry Jack have denied being members of National Action (NA). Birmingham Crown Court was told the pair received an email telling them to ""throw away or burn any memorabilia"" following police counter-terror raids. Prosecutors said the message sent by another NA member showed they were part of the group. Barnaby Jameson QC, prosecuting, said it was a ""masterpiece of back-covering"". The message, headed ""recent news"", read: ""I am sure you have all heard the news that four men have been arrested on the grounds that they are members of the terrorist organisation NA."" Advising several recipients to distance themselves from NA, the message added: ""Delete any affiliations you have to the group. ""Throw away or burn any memorabilia you are holding on to. If anyone is caught breaking the NA proscription or advocating for NA or even holding any NA memorabilia they will be kicked from the group. ""Stay safe and be smart. They are watching the far right's every step now and if even one of us slips up it will cost all of us. This is an all for one and one for all situation."" Alice Cutter, who was alleged to have entered a ""Miss Hitler"" contest, and Mark Jones also deny being part of NA Mr Jones and Mr Jack said they were ""committed and unapologetic"" members of NA but quit the organisation when it was banned, the court heard. They are on trial alongside Alice Cutter, 22, and her partner Mark Jones, 24, both of Mulhalls Mill, Sowerby Bridge, West Yorkshire, who both deny being members of NA between December 2016 and September 2017. Mr Jack, 23, from Heathland Avenue, Shard End, Birmingham, and Mr Scothern, 18, of Bagnall Avenue, Nottingham, are charged with belonging to the organisation between the same dates.

"This video can not be played Protesters in Paris lit fires and vandalised buildings as violence flared last weekend. French police have banned ""yellow vest"" protesters from the Champs-ÃlysÃ©es in Paris on Saturday after rioters destroyed businesses last week. The government has warned that it intends to react severely against any new outbreak of violence. The government for the first time is deploying soldiers to help maintain security, both in Paris and in Nice. But there has been widespread criticism over anti-terrorist forces being used as crowd control. A soldier from the anti-terrorism Sentinelle patrol force told the Franceinfo website of their discomfort at being deployed to control the protests. ""Sentinelle guys are all soldiers - we don't know how to keep order,"" the soldier said, speaking on condition of anonymity. Politicians from across the political spectrum also voiced concerns. Bruno Retailleau, leader of the main opposition Republicans in the Senate, told the France 5 television channel that the decision was a ""serious mistake"". French frustrations boil over in angry debates Anti-Semitism beneath the yellow vests? The story of the yellow vests Who are the yellow vests? The ""yellow vests"" (""gilets jaunes"") started protesting in November, initially because of fuel tax rises. The movement soon evolved into a broader rebellion against perceived elitism, for which activists blame President Emmanuel Macron. Last Saturday shoppers and tourists watched in horror the scenes of lawlessness along the Champs-ÃlysÃ©es, as groups of rioters looted and burned with police seemingly powerless to intervene.  The government says that can't be allowed to happen again. So for this Saturday, the Paris police chief has been replaced, fines for illegal assembly have been increased,  and the area around the Champs-ÃlysÃ©es has been declared off-limits. For the first time soldiers, normally on anti-terrorism patrols, are to be deployed outside public buildings in order to free up police. But that's raised worries about what happens if troops, armed with assault rifles and untrained for riot control, find themselves cornered by a mob. The government says it won't happen because police will always intervene first. Maybe - but the main lessons from four months of yellow vest protests in Paris is that they move quickly from place to place and are very unpredictable. Following last week's riots, which resulted in more than 120 arrests, Mr Macron vowed ""tough"" action. Paris police chief Michel Delpuech was replaced by Didier Lallement, the top police official in the south-west Nouvelle-Aquitaine region. Money has been raised for owners of kiosks that were burned out and some were being replaced on Friday. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Mrs May could put her deal to MPs again but, crucially, allow other options to be voted on as well The cabinet is divided over how to handle the process of asking MPs to vote on alternative Brexit plans. The government has promised to give the Commons the chance to vote on different versions of Brexit if the prime minister's deal is rejected again. But the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg said it had not been decided in government whether the votes should be binding or not and what role ministers would play. MPs believe the process can help break the current parliamentary deadlock. It has been reported MPs could potentially consider up to six options, including remaining in the customs union and single market, a no-deal exit or cancelling Brexit, to gauge support for alternative courses of action. Cabinet minister Greg Clark said it would be the ""right step"" if the prime minister's deal failed again. Brexit's fate in British hands, says Tusk Stop Brexit petition tops 3m signatures He toldNick Robinson's Political Thinking podcastit was not good enough for any plan to ""get over the line"" and there needed to be as wide a consensus as possible behind the terms of withdrawal and the UK's future relations with the EU. ""Something that passes with a majority of one or two, I think, is not doing what we need to do which is to try to build as many people as possible together,"" he told Nick Robinson's Political Thinking Podcast. In the coming days, as many as six other options, in addition to Mrs May's deal, could be voted on: Revoking Article 50 and cancelling Brexit Another referendum The PM's deal plus a customs union The PM's deal plus both a customs union and single market access A Canada-style free trade agreement Leaving the EU without a deal Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who wants his alternative plan for a customs union and guarantees on workers rights to be among those voted on, said there was support for a different way forward. Conservative MP Sir Oliver Letwin, who is spearheading the move with senior Labour MPs including Hilary Benn, said he believed enough MPs would back an amendment to a government motion on Monday to trigger the so-called ""indicative"" votes later in the week. But Conservative Brexiteer Marcus Fysh said the idea of giving MPs a menu of options after two years of negotiations was ""ludicrous and childish"", while ex-minister Steve Baker said it would end in ""national humiliation"". The EU has given the UK until 12 April to decide on a way forward in an attempt to break the current impasse. By the BBC's parliamentary correspondent Mark D'Arcy If the Letwin amendment passes on Monday, it could allow a rough and ready version of the ""indicative votes"" process MPs have been discussing for some time now. Alongside the PM's deal, as many as six other options could be voted on, including: revoking Article 50 and cancelling Brexit another referendum the PM's deal plus a customs union the PM's deal plus both a customs union and single market membership a Canada-style free trade agreement leaving the EU without a deal It is possible other options which could command reasonable levels of support might be added to the mix. At the end all would be voted on simultaneously. MPs would fill out a ballot paper on each, voting for or against, and the relative support could then be seen. Crucially, all the ballot-filling would be done at the same time; it would not be a case of MPs voting on one option, hearing the result, and then voting on the next. So there would be no tactical voting between options. Read Mark's full Parliamentary look-ahead On Thursday, EU leaders agreed to push back the date of Brexit from 29 March until 22 May if Parliament approves the withdrawal agreement at the third time of asking. However, they said the UK would need to come up with a plan B within three weeks if MPs throw out Mrs May's deal yet again. Sir Oliver and Mr Benn hope that Plan B could emerge from indicative votes - with MPs effectively asked to choose from a menu of different options, to see which one gets the most backing. MPs will debate the next steps for Brexit on Monday, as the government scrambles to persuade enough of them to back the prime minister's deal to hold another vote on it later in the week. The indicative votes would not be binding on ministers. But they would signal the degree of support among MPs for alternative options for the UK's future relationship with the EU. After meeting ministers on Friday, Sir Oliver said he believed those searching for a cross-party compromise ""have the numbers"" to guarantee indicative votes will go ahead on Wednesday. ""We are seeking to crystallise a majority in some form of proposition so we have a way forward,"" he said. MPs narrowly failed in an attempt to seize control of the Parliamentary agenda earlier this month to get indicative votes on to the Commons agenda.

"Adam Johnson was jailed for six years in 2016 The father of former England footballer Adam Johnson said it was good to have his son home after his release from prison. The former Middlesbrough, Manchester City and Sunderland star wasjailed for six yearsin 2016 for engaging in sexual activity with a 15-year-old fan. Johnson's father Dave spoke to reporters outside his 31-year-old son's house in Castle Eden, County Durham. The Ministry of Justice said it did not comment on prisoner releases. Johnson had been serving his sentence at HMP Moorland near Doncaster Witnesses said Johnson's father was seen leaving HMP Moorland near Doncaster in the early hours. The car was later seen arriving at the former player's mansion near Hartlepool. Mr Johnson said his son might make a statement later and asked reporters to leave the home's gated entrance. Latest news update from the North East Johnson, who played for England 12 times, was released part way through his jail term. Christopher Stacey, the co-director of Unlock, a charity for people with convictions, said Johnson should be allowed to resume his playing career. He told Press Association Sport: ""People leave prison every day and face difficulties with getting work. It's especially difficult for people convicted of sexual offences. ""The media fascination with Adam Johnson says less about him and his crime and more about us as a society. Do we want people to be punished forever?"" The FA said ""appropriate safeguarding restrictions have been put in place"" regarding Johnson. On the first day of his trial, the winger pleaded guilty to grooming the girl and one charge of sexual activity, relating to kissing her. Sunderland terminated his Â£60,000-a-week contract immediately following his admission of guilt. Jurors found him guilty of sexual touching but cleared him of one charge relating to another sexual act. As a sex offender, Johnson will have to register his address and bank details with police and inform officers of any intention to travel abroad. The crime took place in Johnson's Range Rover His trial at Bradford Crown Court heard Johnson began communicating with the girl at the end of 2014 while his partner, Stacey Flounders, was heavily pregnant with their first child. The victim, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was a Sunderland season ticket holder and was ""infatuated"" with Johnson. Johnson told the jury that when she sent him a friend request on Facebook he recognised her as a Sunderland fan. They exchanged hundreds of messages on various apps before Johnson met up with the girl in his Range Rover on 30 January 2015 after agreeing to sign football shirts for her. It was in the car that the kissing and touching took place.

"Intimidation and abuse of MPs and other people in public office has become worse in the current political climate, a former head of MI5 has said. Lord Evans - the chairman of the Committee on Standards in Public Life - told the BBC it was not just a Brexit-related issue, although that had made things ""particularly acute"". He said some MPs were limiting what they say on public matters. It comes as Met Police figures show a rise in offences against MPs last year. Speaking to Radio 4's World At One programme, Lord Evans said he was ""very concerned"" about a ""problem that isn't going away"". Lord Evans, director general of MI5 between 2007 and 2013, said the threat came from across the political spectrum and has deteriorated since his committee published areport,externalon the issue in December 2017. He said: ""Although there are strong political feelings... it should not and cannot be allowed to spill over into abuse and intimidation."" Lord Evans said he was concerned about damaging impact on public debate Lord Evans added: ""When you get to the point of death threats, when you get to the point of daubing of properties - that is absolutely clearly beyond any acceptable level in a democracy."" He said the problem was connected to the ""political conflict that is going on over our future in or out of Europe"" although such behaviour was not confined to the UK and was a ""sign of our times"". Lord Evans suggested the levels of intimidation were having a damaging impact on public debate and represented an attack on parliamentary democracy. He had three conversations with people who have said they are aware of cases where MPs are ""so concerned that they are both limiting what they are willing to say on public matters, and there is a risk that they will actually feel that they have to change the way in which they are voting"". His comments come a day after anti-Brexit Independent Group MP Anna Soubry said she was unable to go home this weekend to her Broxtowe constituency because she was facing ""serious"" death threats. Meanwhile,MPs were urged to take taxis home from Parliamentand not travel alone in the coming days, over security fears. Deputy Speaker Lindsay Hoyle has written to all MPs ahead of potentially crunch Brexit votes next week, saying police forces have been told to be aware of tensions both at Westminster and locally. Max Hill, the director of public prosecutions, has also written to the Commons human rights committee saying criminal offences against MPs ""imperil both the democratic process and public service"". A Metropolitan Police team was set up to deal with crimes on the Parliamentary estate and against MPs across the UK after themurder of Labour's Jo Coxin 2016. A Freedom of Information request by the BBC shows that 142 offences were reported to the unit in 2017. These included 90 offences related to malicious communications, such as threats via social media e-mail or telephone, as well as harassment and assault. In 2018 that increased to 270 offences  - with the figures showing the number of reports of malicious communications to the police doubled.

"Mike Pompeo is among the administration's most religious members, even attending a bible study group with other Cabinet members US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has said it is ""possible"" that President Donald Trump was sent by God to save Israel from Iran. In an interview with the Christian Broadcasting Network during a high-profile trip to Israel, he said it was his faith that made him believe that. He also praised US efforts to ""make sure that this democracy in the Middle East, that this Jewish state, remains"". The comments came on a Jewish holiday celebrating rescue from genocide. The holiday, Purim, commemorates the biblical rescue of the Jewish people by Queen Esther from the Persians, as the interviewer noted to Mr Pompeo. He was asked if ""President Trump right now has been sort of raised for such a time as this, just like Queen Esther, to help save the Jewish people from an Iranian menace"". ""As a Christian, I certainly believe that's possible,"" said Mr Pompeo, a former member of Congress for Kansas and CIA director. ""I am confident that the Lord is at work here,"" he added. Mr Pompeo came under fire during his tour of the Middle East for holding a conference call and only inviting ""faith-based"" members of the media to join. Mr Pompeo is not the first Trump official to suggest a divine will behind Mr Trump's actions: In January, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders told a religious television network that God ""wanted Donald Trump to become president"". Vice-President Mike Pence and former Attorney General Jeff Sessions have also referenced Christianity orbible verses in official remarks. His administration is also the first in 100 years to have aCabinet member bible study group- of which Mr Pompeo was a member. 'God wanted Trump as president' Trump's unlikely Christian covenant Do more people believe in God in Trump's America? Since becoming president, Mr Trump has sought a hard-line stance against Iran. In May 2018, Mr Trump withdrew the US from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action nuclear deal, calling it ""a horrible one-sided deal"". On Friday, his administration imposed new sanctions on 14 individuals and 17 organisations allegedly involved with Iran's nuclear programme, claiming Iran would not answer questions about its weapons and research. The new sanctions have barred these individuals and organisations from accessing the US financial system or any US assets. And the threat of secondary US sanctions also discourages other countries from doing business with the targeted entities, making them ""radioactive internationally"". Also on Thursday, Mr Trump announced a change in US policy toward the Golan Heights, saying that the territory Israel has occupied from Syria since 1967 should be recognised as part of Israel.

"Sainsbury's and Asda have said they would sell between 125 and 150 supermarkets and a number of convenience stores if allowed to merge. The supermarket giants would also sell some petrol stations, while Sainsbury's has already said it would cap fuel profits for five years. Earlier this week,the supermarkets also vowed Â£1bn in price cuts. The UK's competition watchdog said last month it could block the merger between Sainsbury's and Walmart-owned Asda. Indocuments published by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) on Friday,external, the supermarkets claimed that shoppers would be deprived of lower prices should the Â£12bn deal be blocked. Sainsbury's has more than 1,400 shops in the UK, of which about 800 are convenience stores, while Asda has more than 600. The supermarkets described the CMA's provisional findings into the merger, in which the watchdog warned the deal could be blocked unless they sold off a significant number of stores or even one of the brands, as ""prohibition in all but name"". Their submission said that the CMA's proposed remedy was ""impossible to implement"". They added that they ""categorically reject the CMA's view that coming together will lead to a worse outcome for customers"". Sainsbury's boss Mike Coupe and Asda chief executive Roger Burnley said: ""We have asked the CMA to correct significant errors in its provisional findings. ""Its analysis fundamentally misunderstands how people shop today as well as ignores the intensity of competition and the dynamism of the UK grocery market, which evolves on an almost weekly basis."" Sainsbury's-Asda merger in jeopardy Sainsbury's-Asda deal in nine charts The chief executives added: ""We regret the uncertainty this process causes for our colleagues and want to reassure them that no stores would close because of this merger, with any divested stores run by a credible third party."" The CMA's final report is expected by 30 April. The competition authority published a number of responses to the proposed merger on Friday from a wide-ranging number of organisations, including Waitrose, the National Farmers Union and the consultancy Alix Partners. Waitrose said: ""We remain of the view that should the merger go ahead, the possibility of having two large national players representing well over half of the groceries market, with a significant presence in general merchandising and fuel markets, would fundamentally shift the dynamics of the retail sector, substantially lessening competition at both a national and local level, for both in-store and online activities.""

"It never fails to spark a debate in the pub - but now people applying for civil service jobs are being asked it too. Government bosses want to know how working class their staff think they are - when compared with most people. The answers will not be used to decide who gets a job - but to help recruit a more diverse workforce. The question will be: ""Compared to people in general, would you describe yourself as coming from a lower socio-economic background?"" The options are: Yes, No, Don't Know and Prefer Not To Say. Applicants will also be asked whether they were entitled to free school meals, the type of school they went to and their parents' occupations and qualifications. Eton attacks jobseekers' schools question Why your name matters in the search for a job How hidden bias can stop you getting a job The government has drawn up the questionnaire with leading employers, including telecom giant Telefonica O2 and accountants Ernst and Young. Some employers said they did not want to ask staff and job applicants to rate their own socio-economic background because it would be too subjective,according to the consultation document,external. But the civil service said that particular question had proved popular with its staff and managers - so they would continue to ask it. James Turner, chief executive of social mobility charity The Sutton Trust, said asking about socio-economic background ""in isolation"" would have limited value. ""Anecdotally, when you ask working class people about their social status, they inflate it. There is a tendency to try and sound posher than they are. ""The opposite is true for people from affluent homes."" But he argued that taken together with the other questions on family background and schooling, it could help make the civil service more diverse. A Cabinet Office spokeswoman said: ""We are determined to become the UK's most inclusive employer. ""To monitor progress against that aim, we need to build a picture of our workforce, and one part of that is socio-economic background. ""We want the brightest and best working in the Civil Service and our whole approach is to level the playing field and make sure opportunities are open to everyone, regardless of their background."" The initiative was also backed by the civil service union The First Division Association.

"Josh Coles swallowed a live goldfish after being ""egged on"" by friends, a court heard A man who was filmed swallowing a live goldfish at a funfair and washing it down with a beer has been fined Â£300 for animal cruelty. Josh Coles, 27, from Washfield near Tiverton, was filmed in September 2018 putting the fish he won in his mouth. Exeter magistrates heard Coles was ""amused and bemused"" by the investigation, saying it was ""only a goldfish"". He admitted causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal. The 14-second long video - posted by Coles' girlfriend - showed him holding the fish in his right hand before putting it into his mouth. The clip showed he then drank half a pint of beer to swallow it before opening his mouth to show his friends that he had gulped it down. He was filmed at the Bridgwater Fair in Somerset, which took place between 26 and 29 September. The court heard Coles was a ""class clown"" who showed off in front of people Vet David Martin said the goldfish was still alive when it was swallowed, the court heard. Prosecutor, Lindi Meyer said Coles, a tree surgeon by profession, was ""egged on"" by two other people who laughed as he carried out the act. ""He caused the death of the animal,"" she said. A probation officer said Coles was a ""class clown"" who showed off in front of people and he was ""embarrassed and ashamed"" by what he had done. Solicitor Jeremy Tricks, defending, said Coles had been diagnosed with ADHD, depression and anxiety. Coles was sentenced to a 12-month community order with 200 hours of unpaid work and five days of rehabilitation. From abused dog to Instagram star Beanstalk blunder prompts crowdfund plea 'No consent' for teeth removal operation He was also ordered to pay Â£300 with an Â£85 victim surcharge and was given a five-year ban from keeping fish. Speaking after the hearing, RSPCA Inspector John Pollock said the goldfish would have suffered a ""great deal"".

"The life stories of the Christchurch mosque victims are a striking reflection of a world in turmoil - one marked by war, poverty and economic inequality. In New Zealand, many thought they had found a safe, remote corner of Earth on which to build new lives. That changed last Friday at 13:40 when a gunman casually opened fire. ""I was so happy that I had a beautiful country to raise my kids in,"" says Mazharuddin Syed Ahmed, a survivor of those attacks. ""This really hurts me."" In the week since 50 lives were abruptly taken, Christchurch has come together with powerful messages of unity. For many here, this has opened their eyes to a diverse and complex community they previously gave little attention. But it is also a reminder of how easy it is for hatred to proliferate and then explode - and a closer look at the stories of those who attended the mosques last Friday is also a stark portrait of just how fragile their worlds had always been. Khaled Mustafa, 44, and his son Hamza, 16, were refugees. They had escaped the war in Syria along with three other family members. The family had spent time in Jordan at first, before they were accepted under New Zealand's refugee resettlement programme. They naturally assumed New Zealand was a safe place and had been there for less than a year when they were killed at the Al Noor mosque on Deans Avenue, the site of the first of the two attacks. Abo Ali, a Syrian man who moved to New Zealand in 1990, says he met the family just once but they were ""so happy to have a better life"". ""They run away from the death, and they die here,"" Mr Ali tells the BBC. Hamza's younger brother, Zaid, was also at the mosque. He survived, but was injured. He attended the funeral of his father and brother on Wednesday in a wheelchair, after surgery. ""I shouldn't be standing in front of you. I should be lying beside you,"" he was reportedly heard muttering at their graveside. Abo Ali says the support of New Zealanders has helped the community through the past week Mr Ali says the news hit the local Syrian and Muslim communities hard. ""But after, when we see the New Zealand people's support, and when we see the Christian people in New Zealand too, their support - believe me, we forget about our problem."" In many ways, 24-year-old Ansi Alibava's path to New Zealand was an unlikely one. She was born in Kerala, India, and not into a wealthy family. After her father died in Saudi Arabia, where he had been working, she began looking after the family, aged just 18. Her husband Abdul Nazer says that when they first met, he was struck by how she was ""supporting everything"". The couple had migrated from India a year ago to pursue her dream of studying and travelling overseas. It had been his dream to make hers a reality, he said. It was only when his father agreed to pledge his house for a loan that the pair were able to get to New Zealand. It was the first time either had even been outside of Kerala. After securing jobs in Christchurch they had been supporting both families at home. Mr Nazer can only manage a few words as he describes the bliss they shared in New Zealand. She loved her studies, he says, sitting in a room at Christchurch's Lincoln University where she was working towards a masters degree in agricultural engineering. She had recently begun an internship. He had just been telling his cousin Fahad Ismail Ponnath, who was there to support him, how the campus brought back so many ""lovely memories"" - rooms they had been in together, places they had walked. But last Friday the couple went to the Al Noor mosque as usual, going their own ways into the male and female areas. Abdul Nazer (left) said his wife had room in her heart for all people When the gunfire erupted, Mr Nazer fled the building and leapt over a fence into a nearby property. The owner of that house initially didn't let him in ""thinking that he was one of the terrorists maybe,"" Mr Ponnath says. But he soon left the safety of that house to look for his wife, and he found her lying motionless on a street. As he moved towards her, calling out, other survivors intervened to tell him she had died. Soon the police were there, moving everyone, including her husband, away. In limited English, Mr Nazer, 34, says of his wife: ""She's a really lovely person. Very kindly."" ""She loved all people,"" he says. ""Cousins, friends. She kept a big space in her mind [for] family members. Especially my father and my mother, my brothers."" Mr Nazer doesn't know for sure whether he'll remain in New Zealand, but it is likely, as he is now committed to supporting Ms Alibava's family - they have no breadwinners left. On Wednesday, flowers and tributes were starting to pile up outside Mohammed Imran Khan's takeaway shop, Indian Grill. Mr Khan, also known among friends as Imran Bhai, died in the Linwood mosque. Originally from India, he was an immensely popular figure in Christchurch. ""It's just been an absolutely overwhelming [amount] of texts and messages or communications from people I don't even know - just saying what a lovely man he was,"" his wife Tracey says. ""I knew that people loved him, not so much to this extent, I think. He was a very known man throughout the community for just his heart and giving of time and everything else."" Who were the victims of the mosque shootings? She is focused on looking after their teenage son, as well as her husband's relatives. ""It's very difficult being over the other side of the world and hearing this, and not having information,"" she says, with relatives arriving from around the world. Having spent much of his life in his native India and then Saudi Arabia, Mazharuddin Syed Ahmed says he ""couldn't comprehend"" how safe and inclusive New Zealand was when he arrived. This video can not be played Mazharuddin Syed Ahmed: ""We were all praying... and I heard gunshots"" He used to tell his friends overseas: ""You're scared to death to go to airports. Here, we love the airport. It's like fun - we enjoy it, it's like a pleasure trip for us. Because this country's safe."" Mr Syed Ahmed says the Linwood mosque was home to a small and close community. ""We really love to go on Friday and we were praying,"" he says, emphasising the final word. He cannot believe what happened to him and his friends in the country he regards as the greatest on Earth. Mr Syed Ahmed says he froze when he heard three gunshots interrupting Friday prayers. Abdul Aziz has been hailed a hero for taking on the gunman at the Linwood mosque People continued briefly to pray but his ears ""were completely focused - there is something happening"". Then, he says, one man started yelling: ""Take cover, take cover - move, move, move."" Despite hearing shots, he ran straight towards the main door - he doesn't know why - and took cover in a storage space next to door when the gunman came in. He believes he was saved by another worshipper, Abdul Aziz, who took on the attacker by hurling a credit card machine at him. ""But that time, I saw my friend right in my line of sight,"" Mr Syed Ahmed says. ""[A] big splash of blood was on the wall - I could see that he had died there."" The dozens of victims largely began their lives outside New Zealand, in South Asia and the Middle East, in Somalia or Fiji, Malaysia and Indonesia. Linda Armstrong's family say her last act was saving a friend in the mosque Linda Armstrong, 64, was a New Zealander but her life had been far from conventional, her nephew Kyron Gosse says. At one point, as ""a bit of a hippy"", she had lived on Waiheke Island near her home city of Auckland ""in this little hut in the middle of the bush with only a long drop [toilet] and no shower"", he says. At other times, she had settled in lofts and granny flats, ridden a motorbike, and travelled extensively - once living in Berlin. Always curious, she found Islam in 2011 while volunteering in a refugee centre in Auckland and talking to people there. ""She'd want to know - why? What do you believe?"" Mr Gosse says. ""And as she found out more and more about Islam, she told me: 'These are really beautiful people and this religion really resonates with me'."" He describes his aunt as ""a kind of outrageous character"" who had always been rebellious and a bit stubborn. She brought her stubbornness to the mosque. Following one conversation with a younger relative, she took issue with the plastic waste being generated there - so she went out and bought everyone reusable plates. She rarely had much money but was endlessly generous. Despite living on welfare payments, she began donating NZ$50 (Â£25; $34) per month to a refugee family from Syria. ""She never met them, she just heard about it and thought: what can I do?"" Mr Gosse says. Ms Armstrong ""wasn't in the best of health"", so she was seated at the back of the mosque when the violence came. That didn't stop her moving quickly to protect others. ""She put herself in front of one of her friends, took the bullet, and then died in her arms with the imam saying a prayer over her,"" Mr Gosse tells the BBC. ""We're all pretty proud that that was the sort of person she was."" Across Christchurch this week, locals have been comparing the collective trauma to an earthquake that struck the city in 2011, killing 185 people. It is, many say, a similar pain although they are fully aware that this particular pain has been inflicted by a person, and on a specific community. After an earthquake, a city can rebuild - a physical healing of its wounds. One victim, Zakaria Bhuiya was part of that process. He had moved to Christchurch from Bangladesh to work on the post-quake rebuild, according to the Indian Social and Cultural Club. Mr Bhuiya, a welder, had taken annual leave on Friday to celebrate his 33rd birthday with friends at the Al Noor mosque. ""He lived on the bare basics in order to maximise the money he could send home to support his family,"" his employer AMT Mechanical said. He leaves behind a wife in Bangladesh, Rina Akter. He had no family in Christchurch, but in the days it took officials to identify his body, the friends he had made staged a small protest outside the mosque. ""Our brother is missing, give us some information,"" read one sign. At times in this city of about 400,000 people it feels like everyone knew a victim, or knows someone who did. Peter Higgins, 67, says cardiologist Amjad Hamid had convinced him to retire following ""a heart attack"" and subsequent complications. Peter Higgins says Amjad Hamid had saved many people during his life ""That bloke really turned my life around,"" he says of Dr Hamid, a 57-year-old Palestinian who migrated decades ago. ""He got shot. And I think, how many people has he saved? And someone decides to play out with a gun."" The tragedy has made many think more deeply about the Muslim community here. Clare Needham, 72, says Daoud Nabi - the first of the dead to be identified - would turn up frequently to a charity shop where she volunteered, and would haggle over items. Daoud Nabi was the first of the victims to be formally named Mr Nabi, 70, told her of his deep love for his grandson. It was only this week that she learned the kind of profile he had within the community. Born in Afghanistan but a long-time New Zealand resident, he was president of a local Afghan association and a known supporter of other migrant groups. This video can not be played Farid Ahmed: ""I have forgiven him and I will pray for him"" One visitor to the tributes, Dave Palmer, was struck by the tolerance of Farid Ahmed, whose wife was killed in the attack, yet who told reporters he had forgiven the shooter. ""I thought: I don't know whether I could ever do that,"" says Mr Palmer, a Christian. ""That takes an amazing amount of strength and courage."" The kind of tolerance personified by Farid Ahmed and Linda Armstrong stands in stark contrast to the gunman and the online communities through which material allegedly posted by him spread. Australian Brenton Tarrant, 28, a self-described white supremacist, has been charged with murder. The gunman live-streamed the massacre on Facebook and a person suspected to be him posted a 65,000-word document online, outlining the alleged reasons for the attacks. As many have pointed out since, it was littered with coded references that sought to engage specific online communities. It was posted on 8chan - a forum favoured by the alt-right. It showed just how easy it is for intolerance and hate to ignite in such forums, unlike in the wider community, where tolerance is patiently built up over time. Ultimately, it took just one man and 17 minutes - in the case of the Al Noor attack - to shatter dozens of carefully built, second-chance lives. This video can not be played A comic is asking searching questions about race relations in the wake of the attack Questions have been raised since the attacks about whether forums should be better monitored for evidence of extremism, but experts say this would be challenging for a few reasons - not least the sheer volume of posts. ""We told them our fears about the rise of the alt-right. And the government has not responded adequately,"" says Anjum Rahman, of the Islamic Women's Council of New Zealand, who says she has been pleading with successive governments to address discrimination. Ms Rahman is also sharply critical of the media. ""Where were you?"" she says, arguing there was not enough scrutiny globally. Australia soul-searches after Christchurch Ardern calls for global anti-racism fight How prevalent is far-right extremism? Paul Hunt, New Zealand's chief human rights commissioner, says it has one of the world's best human rights records although it does see Islamophobia, racism and hate crimes in ""some sectors of society"". But if the gunman -whose name Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has sworn she will never speak- had wanted to tear New Zealand apart, judging from the past week he has failed. On Thursday,the prime minister announced a wide-ranging crackdown on New Zealand's gun laws- including banning all the types of weapons used in the attacks. Ardern: 'A leader with love on full display' How mass killings have changed gun laws What are New Zealand's gun laws? Unlike after attacks in the US, for example, it's been almost universally well-received - some people had begun turning in their guns before the ban was even announced. The past week has seen a constant stream of tributes from New Zealanders of all ages and backgrounds Again and again, locals say they are determined to pull together and ensure this tragedy is not repeated. ""I'm trying to process grief but also anger: how dare he do this to us?"" says Cara Butler, 38. ""But I think he's picked the wrong place - I think he's going to see the opposite of what he thought. He's not going to create division, it's going to create community and more cohesion."" Mr Syed Ahmed, the survivor, says his two children ""have New Zealand, Kiwi values - and I'm so happy with that"". But he fears for them, saying all nations - not just New Zealand - must not become complacent. ""Now I see that people can come to the remotest, peaceful corner of Earth,"" he says. ""This just can't happen to this country. You can't leave it just as another incident. We're [travelling] as far as the Moon and Mars, but our neighbourhoods aren't safe for our kids? ""It's everyone's responsibility to deal with this hate."" . Â© 2025 BBC.

"Sainsbury's and Asda have said they would sell between 125 and 150 supermarkets and a number of convenience stores if allowed to merge. The supermarket giants would also sell some petrol stations, while Sainsbury's has already said it would cap fuel profits for five years. Earlier this week,the supermarkets also vowed Â£1bn in price cuts. The UK's competition watchdog said last month it could block the merger between Sainsbury's and Walmart-owned Asda. Indocuments published by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) on Friday,external, the supermarkets claimed that shoppers would be deprived of lower prices should the Â£12bn deal be blocked. Sainsbury's has more than 1,400 shops in the UK, of which about 800 are convenience stores, while Asda has more than 600. The supermarkets described the CMA's provisional findings into the merger, in which the watchdog warned the deal could be blocked unless they sold off a significant number of stores or even one of the brands, as ""prohibition in all but name"". Their submission said that the CMA's proposed remedy was ""impossible to implement"". They added that they ""categorically reject the CMA's view that coming together will lead to a worse outcome for customers"". Sainsbury's boss Mike Coupe and Asda chief executive Roger Burnley said: ""We have asked the CMA to correct significant errors in its provisional findings. ""Its analysis fundamentally misunderstands how people shop today as well as ignores the intensity of competition and the dynamism of the UK grocery market, which evolves on an almost weekly basis."" Sainsbury's-Asda merger in jeopardy Sainsbury's-Asda deal in nine charts The chief executives added: ""We regret the uncertainty this process causes for our colleagues and want to reassure them that no stores would close because of this merger, with any divested stores run by a credible third party."" The CMA's final report is expected by 30 April. The competition authority published a number of responses to the proposed merger on Friday from a wide-ranging number of organisations, including Waitrose, the National Farmers Union and the consultancy Alix Partners. Waitrose said: ""We remain of the view that should the merger go ahead, the possibility of having two large national players representing well over half of the groceries market, with a significant presence in general merchandising and fuel markets, would fundamentally shift the dynamics of the retail sector, substantially lessening competition at both a national and local level, for both in-store and online activities.""

"Thousands of people are still stranded after the cyclone An appeal to help people in Mozambique and Zimbabwe affected by Cyclone Idai has raised Â£8m in 24 hours, the Disasters Emergency Committee has said. The Queen and Prince of Wales were among those who gave donations after the disaster which killed more than 500 people. The total includes Â£2m matched by the government - and it has now pledged to match a further Â£2m on new donations. Broadcasters including the BBC showed DEC's fundraising appeal on Thursday. The powerful cyclone swept in to the city of Beira in Mozambique on 14 March, bringing winds of more than 177 km/h (106 mph). It left a trail of devastation as it moved inland across Zimbabwe and Malawi. More than two million have been affected by the storm and the flooding it caused, with the International Red Cross saying at least 400,000 people have been displaced in Beira. Maps reveal storm's destruction 'We saw 200 bodies by the roadside' Cyclone Idai: What are the immediate dangers? DEC, which brings together 14 UK charities to provide and deliver aid, says it is supporting the rescue and relief effort by delivering clean water, emergency shelter materials, food and health assistance. Chief executive Saleh Saeed said the situation remained ""desperate"" and thousands of people were yet to be brought to safety as rising water continues to hamper the efforts in some areas. The committee brings together 14 UK charities to provide and deliver aid to ensure successful appeals The charities include Oxfam GB, Save the Children UK, Age International, British Red Cross, Cafod, Christian Aid and Islamic Relief Worldwide Its website,externalprovides more details of its Cyclone Idai Appeal and its other current appeals In addition to the pledge to match Â£4m of public donations, the Department for International Development has also provided Â£18m in aid.

"Chris Davies admitted the charges at Westminster Magistrates' Court A Conservative MP has pleaded guilty to two charges of making a false expenses claim. Chris Davies admitted to one charge of providing false or misleading information for allowances claims and one of attempting to do so. The court heard how the charges related to when he was setting up his constituency office following the 2015 general election. The MP for Brecon and Radnorshire will be sentenced at the crown court. Davies, 51, appeared at Westminster Magistrates' Court on Friday, where District Judge John Zani said he did not consider his sentencing powers to be sufficient. MP charged with forgery on expenses claims Police quiz MP again over expenses claim He admitted that in March 2016 he made a claim under the MPs' allowances scheme and provided an invoice that he knew to be ""false or misleading"". The second charge was attempting to provide false or misleading information for an allowance claim using an invoice ""that he knew to be false or misleading"" in April 2016. Two offences of forgery were dropped. The court heard Davies had contacted a photographer in Brecon and purchased nine images from him to decorate and display in his constituency office - using his own money to pay the Â£700 for them initially. There were two budgets available to him, the Start Up Costs Budget - for office furniture and IT equipment - and The Office Costs Budget, both of which he could claim the full amount from. But Philip Stott, prosecuting, revealed Davies found in February 2016 that only Â£476.02 was left in the Start Up Costs Budget, with Â£8,303.75 remaining in the other. He then proceeded to create two fake invoices, so the Â£700 cost could be split between the two budgets - Â£450 to the Start Up and Â£250 for the other. The court heard he could have claimed the full amount from the budget with the larger amount available or had the photographer create new legitimate invoices to split the cost that way. Chris Davies unseated Liberal Democrat Roger Williams at the 2015 general election Mr Stott highlighted in a letter to the party investigating officer sent in February 2018, in which he responded to the allegations against him, that he had been ""told in a conversation by a more experienced MP that you could 'split' expenses"" and therefore attempted to do so. Davies has since repaid the Â£450, with the Â£250 claim never submitted. This is the first prosecution of its kind under the Parliamentary Standards Act. Thomas Forster, defending, said this was a ""disastrous accounting episode"" and added that Davies was the ""author of his own misfortune."" He argued the expenses system was not an ""easy"" one to understand and claimed Davies was ""not motivated"" by ""personal gain"". Mr Forster said his client was a ""family man"" with two children who was local to his constituency. There have been calls for Davies to quit District Judge Zani said he noted that Davies was a man of good character who has shown ""considerable remorse"" and how there was no financial gain for actions. ""However, in my view, these are two very serious offences to which you have pleaded guilty,"" he said. ""The documents you created are troublesome in that they carried a deal of information that you put together which absolutely intended to deceive."" He said as an MP, a position of considerable responsibility and trust, there was a need to be ""meticulous in your claims"". A Welsh Liberal Democrat spokesman said Davies should resign, adding: ""Representing his constituents in these circumstances is untenable. ""Brecon and Radnorshire deserves better from its MP."" Labour Party chairman Ian Lavery, MP for Northumberland, also called on Davies to quit. He said: ""Trust in politics and politicians is essential to our democracy. Chris Davies cannot remain a Tory MP after admitting to this offence."" Davies was charged in February this year. He served as a councillor in Powys before he was elected as MP for Brecon and Radnorshire at the 2015 general election, beating incumbent Liberal Democrat Roger Williams with the seat's largest majority since 1983. He was a Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Wales Office from January to July 2018 Before entering politics he worked as a rural auctioneer, an estate agent and also managed a mixed veterinary practice in Hay-on-Wye.

"Mrs May could put her deal to MPs again but, crucially, allow other options to be voted on as well The cabinet is divided over how to handle the process of asking MPs to vote on alternative Brexit plans. The government has promised to give the Commons the chance to vote on different versions of Brexit if the prime minister's deal is rejected again. But the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg said it had not been decided in government whether the votes should be binding or not and what role ministers would play. MPs believe the process can help break the current parliamentary deadlock. It has been reported MPs could potentially consider up to six options, including remaining in the customs union and single market, a no-deal exit or cancelling Brexit, to gauge support for alternative courses of action. Cabinet minister Greg Clark said it would be the ""right step"" if the prime minister's deal failed again. Brexit's fate in British hands, says Tusk Stop Brexit petition tops 3m signatures He toldNick Robinson's Political Thinking podcastit was not good enough for any plan to ""get over the line"" and there needed to be as wide a consensus as possible behind the terms of withdrawal and the UK's future relations with the EU. ""Something that passes with a majority of one or two, I think, is not doing what we need to do which is to try to build as many people as possible together,"" he told Nick Robinson's Political Thinking Podcast. In the coming days, as many as six other options, in addition to Mrs May's deal, could be voted on: Revoking Article 50 and cancelling Brexit Another referendum The PM's deal plus a customs union The PM's deal plus both a customs union and single market access A Canada-style free trade agreement Leaving the EU without a deal Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who wants his alternative plan for a customs union and guarantees on workers rights to be among those voted on, said there was support for a different way forward. Conservative MP Sir Oliver Letwin, who is spearheading the move with senior Labour MPs including Hilary Benn, said he believed enough MPs would back an amendment to a government motion on Monday to trigger the so-called ""indicative"" votes later in the week. But Conservative Brexiteer Marcus Fysh said the idea of giving MPs a menu of options after two years of negotiations was ""ludicrous and childish"", while ex-minister Steve Baker said it would end in ""national humiliation"". The EU has given the UK until 12 April to decide on a way forward in an attempt to break the current impasse. By the BBC's parliamentary correspondent Mark D'Arcy If the Letwin amendment passes on Monday, it could allow a rough and ready version of the ""indicative votes"" process MPs have been discussing for some time now. Alongside the PM's deal, as many as six other options could be voted on, including: revoking Article 50 and cancelling Brexit another referendum the PM's deal plus a customs union the PM's deal plus both a customs union and single market membership a Canada-style free trade agreement leaving the EU without a deal It is possible other options which could command reasonable levels of support might be added to the mix. At the end all would be voted on simultaneously. MPs would fill out a ballot paper on each, voting for or against, and the relative support could then be seen. Crucially, all the ballot-filling would be done at the same time; it would not be a case of MPs voting on one option, hearing the result, and then voting on the next. So there would be no tactical voting between options. Read Mark's full Parliamentary look-ahead On Thursday, EU leaders agreed to push back the date of Brexit from 29 March until 22 May if Parliament approves the withdrawal agreement at the third time of asking. However, they said the UK would need to come up with a plan B within three weeks if MPs throw out Mrs May's deal yet again. Sir Oliver and Mr Benn hope that Plan B could emerge from indicative votes - with MPs effectively asked to choose from a menu of different options, to see which one gets the most backing. MPs will debate the next steps for Brexit on Monday, as the government scrambles to persuade enough of them to back the prime minister's deal to hold another vote on it later in the week. The indicative votes would not be binding on ministers. But they would signal the degree of support among MPs for alternative options for the UK's future relationship with the EU. After meeting ministers on Friday, Sir Oliver said he believed those searching for a cross-party compromise ""have the numbers"" to guarantee indicative votes will go ahead on Wednesday. ""We are seeking to crystallise a majority in some form of proposition so we have a way forward,"" he said. MPs narrowly failed in an attempt to seize control of the Parliamentary agenda earlier this month to get indicative votes on to the Commons agenda.

"This video can not be played Funeral services were held on Friday for Morgan Barnard, Lauren Bullock and Connor Currie The head of the Catholic Church in Ireland has said a ""valley of tears"" has been caused by the death of three teenagers at a hotel in County Tyrone. Speaking at the funeral for Morgan Barnard, 17, Archbishop Eamon Martin described the anguish felt by relatives and friends of the children. Morgan, Lauren Bullock, 17, and Connor Currie, 16,died after a crush at the Greenvale Hotelin Cookstown. Hundreds of young people were queuing to get into the St Patrick's Day disco. In pictures: Cookstown victims laid to rest Much loved teens remembered How to talk to traumatised teens The funeral service for Morgan Barnard was the first of the three to take place on Friday Two men, including the hotel owner Michael McElhatton, were arrested on Tuesday on suspicion of manslaughter. Mr McElhatton, 52, has since been released on police bail, as has the other man, who is aged 40. Guards of honour were held at all three funerals. Among the mourners at Morgan's funeral at St Patrick's Church in Dungannon, County Tyrone, were pupils from schools in the town and neighbouring Cookstown and Coalisland. Hundreds of mourners attended the funeral service for Morgan Barnard It was a day when young people clung to everything they could to try to bring some comfort. A friend of Morgan Barnard looked at the teenager's picture on the front of the funeral order of service, shook his head, wiped a tear and said: ""We were lucky to have him."" Between them, the three young victims only lived for 50 years. There were three separate funerals in Dungannon, Donaghmore and Edendork. Many people in the area travelled between the three areas in order to be able to offer their condolences to all three families. Archbishop Martin said: ""Words fail us at times like this. ""All that really matters and makes a difference is love and friendship and compassion. ""The shocking events of Sunday last have reminded us that life is very fragile; we need to cherish every moment and always look for each other and keep each other safe,"" he added. Father Aidan McCann, the curate of Dungannon, said Morgan was ""a vivacious, charismatic and energetic young man who nobody had a bad word to say about. This video can not be played On St Patrick's Day, a crush outside a disco in Cookstown killed Lauren Bullock, Morgan Barnard and Connor Currie. ""Morgan was a person of character with a great sense of humour with an abundance of wit, always a smile on his face."" School pupils at the funeral service for Lauren at St Patrick's Church in Donaghmore, County Tyrone, wore purple ribbons in tribute to the teenager who was an accomplished cheerleader with the Euphoria Allstate Group. Friends and family members carried her pink floral coffin into the church. In his homily, Fr David Moore said St Patrick's Day 2019 would be remembered as the ""awful day when three beautiful young people were overpowered, literally, in the mad rush of our modern world and needlessly lost their lives"". Mourners at Lauren Bullock's funeral heard that she gave her time to do good for others Lauren was a girl with a positive outlook on life, he said. ""She was a girl who was happiest when she was doing things to help others and gave of herself and her time to do a good deed whenever and wherever she could,"" he added. Connor Currie's funeral at St Malachy's Church in Edendork, County Tyrone, was the last of the three to take place. Members of St Malachy's Edendork GAC, who Connor Currie played for, flank his coffin Fr Kevin Donaghy said friends had remembered how Connor ""lit up a room as he entered it and his infectious smile warmed everyone's hearts"". He said the Armagh-born teenager was a ""star on the football field"" as well as a ""conscientious student who had his sights set on doing accountancy"". ""He recently went to the McKenna Cup Final with his Tyrone top on but before leaving he let his Armagh-born mother have a peep to see that he had an Armagh top on underneath the Tyrone one,"" added the priest. ""Connor was going to be a winner either way.""

"Thousands of people are still stranded after the cyclone An appeal to help people in Mozambique and Zimbabwe affected by Cyclone Idai has raised Â£8m in 24 hours, the Disasters Emergency Committee has said. The Queen and Prince of Wales were among those who gave donations after the disaster which killed more than 500 people. The total includes Â£2m matched by the government - and it has now pledged to match a further Â£2m on new donations. Broadcasters including the BBC showed DEC's fundraising appeal on Thursday. The powerful cyclone swept in to the city of Beira in Mozambique on 14 March, bringing winds of more than 177 km/h (106 mph). It left a trail of devastation as it moved inland across Zimbabwe and Malawi. More than two million have been affected by the storm and the flooding it caused, with the International Red Cross saying at least 400,000 people have been displaced in Beira. Maps reveal storm's destruction 'We saw 200 bodies by the roadside' Cyclone Idai: What are the immediate dangers? DEC, which brings together 14 UK charities to provide and deliver aid, says it is supporting the rescue and relief effort by delivering clean water, emergency shelter materials, food and health assistance.

"Josh Coles swallowed a live goldfish after being ""egged on"" by friends, a court heard A man who was filmed swallowing a live goldfish at a funfair and washing it down with a beer has been fined Â£300 for animal cruelty. Josh Coles, 27, from Washfield near Tiverton, was filmed in September 2018 putting the fish he won in his mouth. Exeter magistrates heard Coles was ""amused and bemused"" by the investigation, saying it was ""only a goldfish"". He admitted causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal. The 14-second long video - posted by Coles' girlfriend - showed him holding the fish in his right hand before putting it into his mouth. The clip showed he then drank half a pint of beer to swallow it before opening his mouth to show his friends that he had gulped it down. He was filmed at the Bridgwater Fair in Somerset, which took place between 26 and 29 September. The court heard Coles was a ""class clown"" who showed off in front of people Vet David Martin said the goldfish was still alive when it was swallowed, the court heard. Prosecutor, Lindi Meyer said Coles, a tree surgeon by profession, was ""egged on"" by two other people who laughed as he carried out the act. ""He caused the death of the animal,"" she said. A probation officer said Coles was a ""class clown"" who showed off in front of people and he was ""embarrassed and ashamed"" by what he had done. Solicitor Jeremy Tricks, defending, said Coles had been diagnosed with ADHD, depression and anxiety. Coles was sentenced to a 12-month community order with 200 hours of unpaid work and five days of rehabilitation. From abused dog to Instagram star Beanstalk blunder prompts crowdfund plea 'No consent' for teeth removal operation He was also ordered to pay Â£300 with an Â£85 victim surcharge and was given a five-year ban from keeping fish. Speaking after the hearing, RSPCA Inspector John Pollock said the goldfish would have suffered a ""great deal"".

Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn says there is a ""degree of exasperation"" in Europe and in Parliament about the way the PM has dealt with Brexit. He says he made it clear in Brussels yesterday that there is no support for Theresa May's deal, but there is support for other options. Mr Corbyn says Parliament may have a series of indicative votes on Wednesday afternoon next week - which he says it a ""very promising way around the impasse"". DUP deputy leader Nigel
Dodds says the PM ""missed an opportunity"" at the EU summit to put forward proposals that could have ""improved the prospects of an acceptable withdrawal agreement"". He says ""nothing has changed"" in respect of the withdrawal agreement. ""Nothing fundamentally turns on the formal ratification of documents which
the Attorney General has already said do not change the risk of the UK being
trapped in the backstop,"" he says. ""The DUP has been very clear throughout that we want a deal which
delivers on the referendum result and which works for all parts of the UK and
for the EU as well. ""But it must be a deal that protects the union. ""That remains our
abiding principle. We will not accept any deal which poses a long term risk to
the constitutional and economic integrity of the United Kingdom.â Speaking on the delay to Brexit, Taoiseach (Irish PM) Leo Varadkar says: ""There won't be further extensions. ""We've set out now what the timeline is and in many ways the European Union has taken control of the timeline, which in the past had been set by the UK."" Mr Macron says ""it is clear"" the British people made a decision ""without having all the information"". He says Brexit was a ""sovereign decision"" that was ""based on fake news"". ""All those people who spread that have disappeared from the political situation now,"" he says. European Council president Donald Tusk sums up the past two days. Allow Twitter content?

German Chancellor Angela Merkel has welcomed the decision on a Brexit delay. She tells reporters: ""We have, for the time being, prevented a no-deal Brexit for the 29th. ""But these are very short periods of time, so Britain will have to make clear yet again which path it wishes to pursue. ""With the debate we had yesterday night, we proved yet again that what we have done for the past two years will continue to apply, because as 27 member states, we work together and act together."" Asked whether the decision to delay Brexit had allowed Theresa May to ""kick the can further down the road"", European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker says: ""The road the can has in perspective is a very short one."" He jokes about the themes of this week's talks on EU relations with the UK and China. ""We did not talk only about the United Kingdom, but also about China,"" he says. ""The discussion on China was easier than the discussion on the UK. ""Not because China would like to join the EU, but because China isn't leaving.""

"Libby Squire was last seen in the early hours of 1 February The death of Hull student Libby Squire is being treated as ""a potential homicide"", Humberside Police has said. The 21-year-old's body was found in the Humber estuary on Wednesday, seven weeks after she went missing following a night out on 1 February. Detectives said she could have been killed but ""would not be releasing results of a post-mortem examination for investigative reasons"". Det Supt Martin Smalley said ""one man remains under investigation"". He said: ""In regards to our investigation, while we have considered throughout the missing person inquiry that Libby may have come to some harm, Libby's death and the recovery of her body now leads us to solely investigate as a potential homicide. ""The post-mortem examination concluded late last night and at this stage, we will not be releasing any results for investigative and operational reasons."" An inquest into her death is due to open and adjourn on Monday. Flowers and tributes have been left on a bench in Hull's Beverley Road where Ms Squire was last seen Det Supt Smalley said specially trained officers were continuing to support Ms Squire's family. ""Our thoughts remain today with Libby's family and friends at this incredibly sad and devastating time for them,"" he said. ""Libby captured the hearts of not just the people in Hull, but across the country, and as I have said before, the support shown has been overwhelming and my sincerest thanks to absolutely everyone who has been involved."" Hull Minster has invited people to light a candle in memory of the student Libby's body was recovered at around 15:30 GMT on Wednesday close to Spurn Point and taken to Grimsby Docks. A major police inquiry saw hundreds of officers and about 50 detectives search for the student. On the night of her disappearance, police believe Ms Squire got a taxi at the Welly Club music venue before arriving at her student house in Wellesley Avenue at about 23:30 on 31 January, where her mobile phone was found. They think she did not enter the house and have said her phone ""has not provided any further insight as to her movements that night"". She was spotted on CCTV 10 minutes later near a bench on Beverley Road, where it is thought a motorist stopped to offer her help. The bench has become a focal point for those wishing to remember Ms Squire, from High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, and floral tributes have been left at the site.

"Ian Ogle died in the street near his home in Cluan Place after he was stabbed and beaten Eleven men have been arrested in a major operation into the criminal activities of the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) in east Belfast. The Paramilitary Crime Task Force made the arrests during raids of 14 properties in the greater Belfast, Ards and Comber areas. The men, aged between 22 and 48, are in police custody. The PSNI has linked the operation withthe murder of Ian Ogle in east Belfast. Mr Ogle, 45, died after he was stabbed and beaten in a street near his home on January 27. What is the UVF?,external A history of the UDA,external Analysing a loyalist statement The PSNI said tackling the UVF was a priority for the force because of its drug activities, particularly the supply of Class A drugs. They have confirmed that suspected Class A drugs valued at Â£15,000, ""high value"" vehicles and jewellery and a significant sum of cash were also seized in the raids, which began on Friday morning. These searches around greater Belfast have been in the pipeline for months. It's a pretty significant operation and I've been out with the team since early this morning. We attended a house raid in east Belfast at 07:00 GMT. A team of officers broke the door down and arrested one man inside. Det Supt Bobby Singleton said the UVF were ""nothing more than a drugs gang"" and that the police had a good case against those who had been arrested. ""These gangs aren't there to help the area they're in - they're there to exploit and make money off the community,"" he said. ""This investigation has been ongoing for some time and today's action will likely lead to further action by the Paramilitary Crime Task Force."" The UVF is a loyalist paramilitary group which was responsible for hundreds of murders during the Troubles in Northern Ireland. In some cases its memberscontinue to be heavily involved in violence and crime.

"What now? Theresa May has been granted a little breathing space. The EU has allowed a few more days to try to get her deal through the House of Commons. But it's not the timetable that she chose. And as things stand, the expectation that the compromise deal will get through is low. And, more to the point, the government does not believe that it can hold off another attempt by a powerful cross-party group of MPs who are resolved to put Parliament forcibly in charge of the process to find alternatives. Ministers are therefore today not just wondering about how to manage one last heave for the prime minister's deal, but what they should do next, when - odds on - the whole issue is in the hands of the Commons, not Number 10. Brexit pushed back by at least two weeks EU wins some Brexit breathing space Brexit: What just happened? Brexitcast - TrÃ¨s Spikey Within days, MPs will push for a series of votes on different versions of Brexit - the ""Norway"" model, another referendum, Labour's version of Brexit with a customs union, the list goes on. But here's the dilemma. Does Theresa May just wait for Parliament to do what one minister describes as ""grab control of the order paper""? Or should they instead try to lead the process, forcing what another member of the cabinet described as a ""fresh start"", even though it seems ""ludicrous"" to be resetting the whole process in this way at this stage? Some in the government believe the best choice is to take charge of this next stage - to lead the process as Parliament and the opposition parties try to find a new compromise. Sounds like a no brainer. But there is a real hesitation over whether the Labour frontbench are really interested in trying to find a compromise or will, ultimately, be too tempted by the political opportunity of pulling the rug from under the government at the very last minute. And given that the majority of MPs are, theoretically, in favour of a softer Brexit than the one the prime minister has negotiated, could Theresa May really preside over a process that would end up there? But if the government sits back and just lets Parliament get on with it, then Number 10 accepts becoming a passenger - entirely in the hands of the MPs whose behaviour the prime minister so reviled in thatcontroversial address in Number 10 on Wednesday night. Don't forget - for many Brexiteers in the Conservative Party, the idea of a softer Brexit than the one the prime minister has negotiated is nothing short of an abomination. (That could, in a hypothetical world, mean that more of them are willing to back Theresa May's deal than currently expected - if it is the ""hardest"" brexit that is on offer). So for Theresa May's survival as leader of the Conservative Party, there is a case, strange as it sounds, for her to hang back from leading the next phase. If Parliament chooses a softer Brexit in the end, it could suit Mrs May not to have her fingerprints on it. But is it really a tenable leadership strategy, choosing not to lead? Brexit has done some very strange things to our political process. The reality is though, if Theresa May next week accepts the will of Parliament and it is ""soft Brexit"", the reaction from the Conservative Party could be explosive. Frankly, the choices for Theresa May are running out. Many Tories on all sides of the debate are deeply alarmed by how things have unravelled in the last few days. One senior, influential, MP who has been studiously loyal to the prime minister is incandescent, saying that she has ""angered all the people whose support she needed"", and that ""she is the most stubborn and ill-suited person for this job"". Another former minister suggests Theresa May's deal still could pass, but only if she tempts Labour rebels across with a promise of a referendum to give the public the chance to rubber stamp it, or ""we'll have a new PM with a new plan"", and maybe soon. One current member of the government says ""only Number Ten can't see that she is on her way out"". Another minister says the situation is ""super dangerous"". All of the fundamental factors that have preserved her so far remain - there is no obvious alternative plan that is certain to get a majority of MPs on side. There is no obvious leader in waiting that the whole Conservative Party would gladly choose. The Labour Party have their own battles with their own divisions over Brexit. The traditional claim of TINA - There Is No Alternative - has helped Theresa May hang on. But now an alternative to her deal is likely to be forced upon her, one that could make her leadership impossible to maintain. Theresa May arrives back in Number 10 today having won a little bit of extra time, but she has less and less space to breathe.

"Advertising watchdog the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) has ordered 150 homeopaths operating in the UK to stop claiming they can cure autism. Five of them face prosecution for advertising a treatment called Cease therapy, which has no scientific basis and is potentially harmful. The National Autistic Society says autism is part of who people are and it is wrong to claim that it can be cured. The Society of Homeopaths said the therapy may now be renamed. Cease stands for the Complete Elimination of Autism Spectrum Expression. It is a form of homeopathy, based on the idea that toxins in the environment and vaccines may cause autism. Therapists claim they can cure autism by removing these 'harmful' substances with homeopathic remedies and dietary supplements. But there is no scientific evidence for any link between vaccines and autism, and experts say Cease therapy is potentially harmful. Prof Nicola Martin, from London South Bank University, advised the Westminster Commission on autism and said Cease therapy was ""based on no scientific foundation whatsoever"". ""It talks about curing autism; autism is not a disease and not something which needs to be cured. ""Psychologically it's really harmful to give parents the idea that the way to love and nurture their autistic child is to try and cure their autism."" Cease therapists recommend giving autistic children four to five times more zinc than is recommended by the Department of Health and 200 times more vitamin C, even though large quantities of vitamin C can cause diarrhoea and vomiting. Cease therapists recommend giving autistic children 200 times more vitamin C than is recommended Emma Dalmayne, campaigner against harmful interventions for autism, has been campaigning for five years for legislation against fake cures for autism. ""As an autistic adult, it disgusts me that these charlatans are taking advantage of parents,"" she said. ""There needs to be legislation to stop these snake oil salesmen."" Autism-anorexia link 'must be acted on' How does someone with autism go shopping? Schoolgirl writes book to explain autism The ASA's investigation found that 150 Cease therapists breached advertising guidelines that adverts must not falsely claim a product is able to cure an illness or dysfunction. The ASA wrote to them all of them ordering them to stop making claims they can cure autism. The ASA's chief executive, Guy Parker, told Radio 4's You and Yours that they were concerned about misleading and potentially harmful claims on therapists' websites. ""We sent out enforcement notices to 150 Cease therapists operating in the UK. We have set out very clearly that they must not make either direct or implied claims in their ads including on their own websites that their therapy can either treat or cure autism. ""Those failing to get their houses in order will be targeted with further sanctions."" The National Autistic Society said it was pleased that the ASA is taking action against what it called ""the bogus claims by people pedalling Cease therapy"". Carol Povey, director of the National Autistic Society's Centre for Autism, said: ""Autism is lifelong.  It's not a disease or an illness. And many autistic people feel that their autism is a core part of their identity.

"This video can not be played ""I hope we can all agree we are now at the moment of decision"" Theresa May has been granted an extra two weeks to come up with a Brexit solution after talks with EU leaders. The UK's departure date had originally been set for 29 March. If Mrs May can get her withdrawal deal through Parliament next week, that date will be pushed back to 22 May to give time to pass the necessary legislation. If the prime minister can't get the deal through, the UK will have to propose a way forward by 12 April for EU leaders to consider. European Council President Donald Tusk said all Brexit options would remain open until then. Reaction after EU leaders agree Brexit delay Nigel Farage back as Brexit Party leader Brexit: What just happened? ""The UK government will still have a choice between a deal, no deal, a long extension or revoking Article 50,"" he said. ""The 12 April is a key date in terms of the UK deciding whether to hold European Parliament elections. ""If it has not decided to do so by then, the option of long extension will automatically become impossible."" Mrs May ruled out revoking Article 50, which would cancel Brexit, and she also said ""it would be wrong"" to ask Britons to vote for candidates for the elections to the European Parliament, due to be held from 23-26 May, three years after they voted to leave the EU. The UK's departure date is still written in to law as next Friday, 29 March. 29 March:Current Brexit date in UK law 12 April:If MPs do not approve the withdrawal deal next week - ""all options will remain open"" until this date. The UK must propose a way forward before this date for consideration by EU leaders. 22 May:If MPs do approve the deal next week, Brexit will be delayed until this date 23-26 May:European Parliamentary elections are held across member states EU wins some Brexit breathing space Stop Brexit petition tops 3m signatures Brexitcast: Tres Spikey Mrs May is expected to table secondary legislation - that has to go through the Commons and the Lords by next Friday - to remove 29 March from UK law. But Downing Street sources say an agreement with the EU to extend the Brexit deadline would be a piece of international law and would take precedence even if Parliament rejected it. Mrs May said MPs had a ""clear choice"". Speaking on Thursday, after waiting for the 27 other EU countries to make their decision at a summit in Brussels, the prime minister said she would now be ""working hard to build support for getting the deal through"". The withdrawal deal, negotiated over two years between the UK and EU, sets out the terms of the UK's departure from the bloc, including the ""divorce bill"", the transition period, citizens' rights and the controversial ""backstop"" arrangements, aimed at preventing a return to border checks between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. But it must be approved by UK MPs, who have already rejected it twice by large margins. MPs are expected to vote for a third time on it next week,despite Commons Speaker John Bercow saying what is put forward must be substantially different to be voted on. Theresa May has been granted a little breathing space. The EU has allowed a few more days to try to get her deal through the House of Commons. But it's not the timetable that she chose. And as things stand, the expectation that the compromise deal will get through is low. And, more to the point, the government does not believe that it can hold off another attempt by a powerful cross-party group of MPs who are resolved to put Parliament forcibly in charge of the process to find alternatives. Ministers are therefore today not just wondering about how to manage one last heave for the prime minister's deal, but what they should do next, when - odds on - the whole issue is in the hands of the Commons, not Number 10. Read Laura's blog Senior Labour MP Hilary Benn has also said that he will table an amendment on Monday, enabling MPs to hold a series of ""indicative votes"" on Wednesday on alternatives to Mrs May's plan. He said these could include a free trade agreement, a customs union and a referendum. He told the BBC the EU's decision was ""a case of crisis delayed, not crisis ended"" as it still looked unlikely that Mrs May's deal would be approved. ""We cannot have a no-deal Brexit in three weeks' time,"" he said. The government is also exploring with opposition parties the idea of holding ""indicative"" votes on alternatives to its own Brexit policy, in an effort to retain some control over the process. Plaid Cymru's leader at Westminster, Liz Saville Roberts, who has been taking part in the talks, said: ""The government is now openly exploring a process to allow Parliament to take control - an effective admission that they have lost all authority. ""We will be continuing to push for a People's Vote as a way out of this Brexit mess."" This video can not be played Greg Clark: May's MPs speech 'not a great success' At a news conference on Thursday night, Mrs May also struck a conciliatory tone when she referred toher speech from Downing Street the previous evening, which had sparked an angry reaction from MPs after she blamed them for the Brexit deadlock. ""Last night I expressed my frustration and I know that MPs are frustrated too,"" she said. ""They have difficult jobs to do."" Speaking to Nick Robinson's Political Thinking podcast, Business Secretary Greg Clark said that speech ""clearly wasn't a great success"". ""I don't think it was helpful in resolving the matter. But, listen, none of us is infallible and even prime ministers sometimes don't get the tone quite right,"" he said. It comes after a petition calling for Article 50 to be revokedpassed three million signatures. A march demanding another referendum is also planned for Saturday in central London. In her briefing to journalists, Mrs May dismissed calls to revoke Article 50 - the process by which the UK leaves the EU - which would mean Brexit is cancelled. Mrs May said people had voted to leave and were told their decision would be respected.

"Mike Pompeo is among the administration's most religious members, even attending a bible study group with other Cabinet members US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has said it is ""possible"" that President Donald Trump was sent by God to save Israel from Iran. In an interview with the Christian Broadcasting Network during a high-profile trip to Israel, he said it was his faith that made him believe that. He also praised US efforts to ""make sure that this democracy in the Middle East, that this Jewish state, remains"". The comments came on a Jewish holiday celebrating rescue from genocide. The holiday, Purim, commemorates the biblical rescue of the Jewish people by Queen Esther from the Persians, as the interviewer noted to Mr Pompeo. He was asked if ""President Trump right now has been sort of raised for such a time as this, just like Queen Esther, to help save the Jewish people from an Iranian menace"". ""As a Christian, I certainly believe that's possible,"" said Mr Pompeo, a former member of Congress for Kansas and CIA director. ""I am confident that the Lord is at work here,"" he added. Mr Pompeo came under fire during his tour of the Middle East for holding a conference call and only inviting ""faith-based"" members of the media to join. Mr Pompeo is not the first Trump official to suggest a divine will behind Mr Trump's actions: In January, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders told a religious television network that God ""wanted Donald Trump to become president"". Vice-President Mike Pence and former Attorney General Jeff Sessions have also referenced Christianity orbible verses in official remarks. His administration is also the first in 100 years to have aCabinet member bible study group- of which Mr Pompeo was a member. 'God wanted Trump as president' Trump's unlikely Christian covenant Do more people believe in God in Trump's America? Since becoming president, Mr Trump has sought a hard-line stance against Iran. In May 2018, Mr Trump withdrew the US from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action nuclear deal, calling it ""a horrible one-sided deal"". On Friday, his administration imposed new sanctions on 14 individuals and 17 organisations allegedly involved with Iran's nuclear programme, claiming Iran would not answer questions about its weapons and research. The new sanctions have barred these individuals and organisations from accessing the US financial system or any US assets. And the threat of secondary US sanctions also discourages other countries from doing business with the targeted entities, making them ""radioactive internationally"". Also on Thursday, Mr Trump announced a change in US policy toward the Golan Heights, saying that the territory Israel has occupied from Syria since 1967 should be recognised as part of Israel. Trump: Time to recognise Golan as Israeli What Trumpâs Golan Heights move really means In recent days, Mr Trump has accused his Democratic rivals of being ""anti-Israel"" and ""anti-Jewish"". The president is due to meet Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu next week, when he is in Washington to attend the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (Aipac) annual meeting. The remarks by Mr Pompeo, and the Golan announcement by Mr Trump, come just weeks before Israeli elections are held on 9 April.

"The office was opened with great fanfare in September 2018 North Korea has withdrawn from the inter-Korean liaison office which was opened amid a warming of ties last year to facilitate talks with the South. Seoul said it was contacted on Friday and informed that the North's staff would be leaving later in the day. It has expressed its regret at the decision and is urging staff from the North to return as soon as possible. The pullout follows a failed summit between the US and North Korean leaders in Hanoi last month. The liaison office, located in the North Korean border city of Kaesong, had allowed officials from North and South Korea to communicate on a regular basis for the first time since the Korean War. It is meant to be staffed by up to 20 people from each side. When the office was opened in September 2018, it was hailed as representing a significant step forward in inter-Korean relations. The two sides had in the past communicated by fax or special phone lines, which would often be cut when relations soured. What to make of the Hanoi summit collapse? US threw away 'golden opportunity' - N Korea North Korea crisis in 300 words At the time, Seoul's Unification Minister said it would allow for direct discussion of any issues ""24 hours, 365 days"". Since last month's failed summit in Vietnam between the US and North Korean leaders, Pyongyang has warned that it could resume missile and nuclear testing. Vice Foreign Minister Choe Son-hui said earlier this month that Washington threw away ""a golden opportunity"" at the summit. This video can not be played BBC's Laura Bicker explains why Trump the 'biggest loser' from the summit President Trump had said at the time that Mr Kim had asked for the removal of all sanctions - which the US could not agree to. But Ms Choe said that the North had only asked for five key economic sanctions to be lifted. US officials have insisted that diplomacy is still ""alive"". President Moon had hoped his diplomatic relationship with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un would survive even if talks between the US and the North broke down. At the moment, this position looks questionable. Mr Moon was counting on his skills as a mediator to try to get US-North Korea talks back on track. But Pyongyang now appears unwilling to talk to Seoul and Mr Moon may not have the influence he needs to get Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un back to the negotiating table. North Korea may also be asking itself - what is the point of talking to the South? Before the Trump-Kim summit in Hanoi, the two sides were discussing ways to develop economic ties. South Korea had hoped to ask for sanctions exemptions from the US to take part in part in various projects, but Donald Trump has made it clear that will not be acceptable. Pyongyang concluded in a recent newspaper editorial that South Korea can do nothing without US approval. This announcement will also test the patience of South Korean people. They watched the soaring rhetoric between the two Korean leaders as they held hands during their historic summits last year. Many started to believe, that after 70 years of false hope, this time would be different.  But North Korea is now walking away from the pledges it made and this latest development will be seen by many as a sign that peace is once again a distant prospect.

"Adam Johnson was jailed for six years in 2016 The father of former England footballer Adam Johnson said it was good to have his son home after his release from prison. The former Middlesbrough, Manchester City and Sunderland star wasjailed for six yearsin 2016 for engaging in sexual activity with a 15-year-old fan. Johnson's father Dave spoke to reporters outside his 31-year-old son's house in Castle Eden, County Durham. The Ministry of Justice said it did not comment on prisoner releases. Johnson had been serving his sentence at HMP Moorland near Doncaster Witnesses said Johnson's father was seen leaving HMP Moorland near Doncaster in the early hours. The car was later seen arriving at the former player's mansion near Hartlepool. Mr Johnson said his son might make a statement later and asked reporters to leave the home's gated entrance. Latest news update from the North East Johnson, who played for England 12 times, was released part way through his jail term. Christopher Stacey, the co-director of Unlock, a charity for people with convictions, said Johnson should be allowed to resume his playing career. He told Press Association Sport: ""People leave prison every day and face difficulties with getting work. It's especially difficult for people convicted of sexual offences. ""The media fascination with Adam Johnson says less about him and his crime and more about us as a society. Do we want people to be punished forever?"" The FA said ""appropriate safeguarding restrictions have been put in place"" regarding Johnson. On the first day of his trial, the winger pleaded guilty to grooming the girl and one charge of sexual activity, relating to kissing her. Sunderland terminated his Â£60,000-a-week contract immediately following his admission of guilt. Jurors found him guilty of sexual touching but cleared him of one charge relating to another sexual act. As a sex offender, Johnson will have to register his address and bank details with police and inform officers of any intention to travel abroad. The crime took place in Johnson's Range Rover His trial at Bradford Crown Court heard Johnson began communicating with the girl at the end of 2014 while his partner, Stacey Flounders, was heavily pregnant with their first child. The victim, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was a Sunderland season ticket holder and was ""infatuated"" with Johnson. Johnson told the jury that when she sent him a friend request on Facebook he recognised her as a Sunderland fan. They exchanged hundreds of messages on various apps before Johnson met up with the girl in his Range Rover on 30 January 2015 after agreeing to sign football shirts for her. It was in the car that the kissing and touching took place.

"A suspect package found at a post depot in County Limerick appears to be identical to explosive packages found in the UK earlier this month, gardaÃ­ (Irish police) have said. Irish Defence Forces said a ""viable improvised explosive device"" had been found contained in a plastic envelope. On 5 and 6 March,devices were received at addresses in London and Glasgow. Responsibility was claimed by a group calling itself the IRA. The caller, who used a recognised code word, claimed five devices had been sent, but only four had been discovered. On Friday, gardaÃ­ said they received a report of the package at an An Post office on Dock Road at about 06:00 local time. Speaking on RTÃ's Today programme with Sean O'Rourke, Irish Minister for Justice Charlie Flanagan said the incidents in the UK were the result of heightened tensions in Northern Ireland due to uncertainty over Brexit. He said the sending of such devices was a ""totally unacceptable act"". University of Glasgow evacuated over suspect package Explosives found at airports and station The Limerick post office was evacuated and the army Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) team were notified. One of the devices which was sent to Heathrow Airport in March caught fire when staff opened it Post office staff contacted police after the package was discovered and up to 100 staff employed at the sorting office were moved out when the alert was raised, RTÃ reported. The office is the National Return Letter Centre, which acts as the depot for all undeliverable mail in the country. The packages that arrived at Waterloo railway station and offices at Heathrow and London City airports on 5 and 6 of March were posted with Irish stamps and had Dublin as the return address, prompting Irish police to join the investigation. The stamps appeared to be those issued by the Irish postal service for Valentine's Day 2018, featuring a heart motif and the words ""Love Eire N"". In a statement, a spokesperson for the Metropolitan Police said it was keeping ""an open mind"" as enquiries continue. ""We are aware that those claiming responsibility have indicated five devices were sent. At this time, only four devices have been recovered,"" the statement said. ""Extensive advice has already been issued to relevant businesses and sectors to be vigilant for and report suspicious packages to police. This advice was previously sent to armed forces personnel and is being reiterated again in light of this claim."" Police Scotland said a controlled explosion was carried out as a precaution on a suspicious package found in the mailroom at Glasgow University, after several buildings had been evacuated. All packages were A4-sized white postal bags containing yellow Jiffy bags and appeared capable of igniting a small fire when opened. No-one was injured in any of the incidents in Britain. Responsibility for a car bomb outside Londonderry's court house in January was claimed by the IRA The parcel bomb incidents came almost a year after MI5 downgraded the threat posed in Britain by Irish republicans. It is currently classified as ""moderate"", meaning attacks are possible, but not likely. In Northern Ireland, the risk is greater, exemplified by a car bomb whichdetonated in Londonderryin January. All the attacks were claimed by an organisation calling itself the IRA. It is often referred to as ""the new IRA"", to distinguish it from the group which was active in Northern Ireland's troubles. It is comprised of dissidents who never accepted its namesake's ceasefire more than 20 years ago. Police on both sides of the Irish Sea have mostly been able to contain its threat. They have described it as ""a small"" organisation, perhaps with 50 or so actively engaging in terrorist activity.

"Thousands of people are still stranded after the cyclone An appeal to help people in Mozambique and Zimbabwe affected by Cyclone Idai has raised Â£8m in 24 hours, the Disasters Emergency Committee has said. The Queen and Prince of Wales were among those who gave donations after the disaster which killed more than 500 people. The total includes Â£2m matched by the government - and it has now pledged to match a further Â£2m on new donations. Broadcasters including the BBC showed DEC's fundraising appeal on Thursday. The powerful cyclone swept in to the city of Beira in Mozambique on 14 March, bringing winds of more than 177 km/h (106 mph). It left a trail of devastation as it moved inland across Zimbabwe and Malawi. More than two million have been affected by the storm and the flooding it caused, with the International Red Cross saying at least 400,000 people have been displaced in Beira.

"Sainsbury's and Asda have said they would sell between 125 and 150 supermarkets and a number of convenience stores if allowed to merge. The supermarket giants would also sell some petrol stations, while Sainsbury's has already said it would cap fuel profits for five years. Earlier this week,the supermarkets also vowed Â£1bn in price cuts. The UK's competition watchdog said last month it could block the merger between Sainsbury's and Walmart-owned Asda. Indocuments published by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) on Friday,external, the supermarkets claimed that shoppers would be deprived of lower prices should the Â£12bn deal be blocked. Sainsbury's has more than 1,400 shops in the UK, of which about 800 are convenience stores, while Asda has more than 600. The supermarkets described the CMA's provisional findings into the merger, in which the watchdog warned the deal could be blocked unless they sold off a significant number of stores or even one of the brands, as ""prohibition in all but name"". Their submission said that the CMA's proposed remedy was ""impossible to implement"". They added that they ""categorically reject the CMA's view that coming together will lead to a worse outcome for customers"". Sainsbury's boss Mike Coupe and Asda chief executive Roger Burnley said: ""We have asked the CMA to correct significant errors in its provisional findings. ""Its analysis fundamentally misunderstands how people shop today as well as ignores the intensity of competition and the dynamism of the UK grocery market, which evolves on an almost weekly basis."" Sainsbury's-Asda merger in jeopardy Sainsbury's-Asda deal in nine charts The chief executives added: ""We regret the uncertainty this process causes for our colleagues and want to reassure them that no stores would close because of this merger, with any divested stores run by a credible third party."" The CMA's final report is expected by 30 April. The competition authority published a number of responses to the proposed merger on Friday from a wide-ranging number of organisations, including Waitrose, the National Farmers Union and the consultancy Alix Partners. Waitrose said: ""We remain of the view that should the merger go ahead, the possibility of having two large national players representing well over half of the groceries market, with a significant presence in general merchandising and fuel markets, would fundamentally shift the dynamics of the retail sector, substantially lessening competition at both a national and local level, for both in-store and online activities.""

"A 21-year-old man and a 28-year-old woman, both from Rugby, were arrested on suspicion of arson A five-year-old boy has died from his injuries four months after a house fire - leading police to launch a murder inquiry. Two other children and a woman, believed to be their mother, suffered burns in the fire in Wentworth Road, Rugby, in the early hours of 15 November. Warwickshire Police said a man, 21, and a 28-year-old woman, both from Rugby, were previously arrested on suspicion of arson. They are on police bail until April. The force said it was working with the fire service to establish the cause. Det Insp Teresa McKenna, from the Major Investigation Unit, said: ""We're sad to report that the boy injured in the fire has died and as a result this has now become a murder investigation. ""We remain committed to establishing the exact circumstances leading up to the fire and continue to appeal to the public for any information that could help with our investigation.""

"James Gavin, Mick Murray and Michael Hayes were three of four men named by Witness O at the inquests A convicted IRA bomber has named four men he says were responsible for the 1974 Birmingham pub bombings. At inquests into the deaths of the 21 victims, ""Witness O"" named the men responsible as Seamus McLoughlin, Mick Murray, Michael Hayes and James Gavin. He said he had been given permission to reveal the names by the current head of the IRA in Dublin. The witness was part of an active service unit in the city, but was in prison at the time of the bombings. Speaking via video link he accepted the bombings were an ""atrocity"". Bombs detonated in the Mulberry Bush and the Tavern in the Town Seamus McLoughlin, who was also named by Witness O at the inquests, has since died Bombs exploded at the Mulberry Bush in the base of the city's Rotunda and the Tavern in the Town in nearby New Street. Witness O said he believed police had been given a warning that would have given adequate time to evacuate the busy pubs. He named Seamus McLoughlin as the officer commanding the Birmingham IRA at the time and said he was the person responsible for selecting the targets. He said Mick Murray was ""one of the bombers"" and claimed he recalled how Murray told him there would be ""no harm"" if similar bombings had been repeated, because of the ""chaos"" caused. When pressed by a lawyer for the bereaved families, he said Michael Hayes and James Gavin were also part of the team. Julie Hambleton's sister Maxine was killed in the Tavern in the Town All four men have been previously named in connection with the bombings, but not in a formal setting. In July 2017, Michael Hayes gave an interview to BBC News Northern Irelandin which he said he was part of the group responsible for the bombings. He said he was sorry innocent people had been killed. He refused to say who planted the bombs, but said he was speaking out to give ""the point of view of a participant"". The Birmingham pub bombings killed these 21 people in November 1974 At the inquests on Friday Mr Leslie Thomas QC asked Witness O whether a previously named suspect, Michael Patrick Reilly, had been involved. The witness said: ""No, I don't remember him at all. Reilly? I would remember that."" Mr Reilly has always denied any involvement in the bombings. Who were Birmingham pub bombings victims? Pub blasts 'IRA operation that went wrong' Latest news from the West Midlands The inquests previously heard the bombings were ""an IRA operation that went badly wrong"". The bombs killed 21 and injured 220 at the two pubs on 21 November 1974. Former IRA intelligence chief Kieran Conway had previously said the attacks were ""not sanctioned"" by the IRA and were ""accidental deaths"". The inquests were not supposed to address the issue of the identities of the bombers, but after being told that relatives had been in ""pain and suffering for the last 44 years"", Witness O agreed to name them. He said he would do so even though it could put his own life at risk from new dissident groups. As the names were given, many of the bereaved family members broke down in tears. Sheila Hunt, whose son Stephen Whalley was killed in the bombings, told the BBC she would like to know ""who was actually responsible"".

Following the hearing, Ulster Unionist Assembly Member Doug Beattie, said: ""Given that numerous Sinn FÃ©in politicians have claimed that there is no IRA, you wonder just who is sitting in Dublin, claiming to be the head of it.

"A suspect package found at a post depot in County Limerick appears to be identical to explosive packages found in the UK earlier this month, gardaÃ­ (Irish police) have said. Irish Defence Forces said a ""viable improvised explosive device"" had been found contained in a plastic envelope. On 5 and 6 March,devices were received at addresses in London and Glasgow. Responsibility was claimed by a group calling itself the IRA. The caller, who used a recognised code word, claimed five devices had been sent, but only four had been discovered. On Friday, gardaÃ­ said they received a report of the package at an An Post office on Dock Road at about 06:00 local time. Speaking on RTÃ's Today programme with Sean O'Rourke, Irish Minister for Justice Charlie Flanagan said the incidents in the UK were the result of heightened tensions in Northern Ireland due to uncertainty over Brexit. He said the sending of such devices was a ""totally unacceptable act"". University of Glasgow evacuated over suspect package Explosives found at airports and station The Limerick post office was evacuated and the army Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) team were notified. One of the devices which was sent to Heathrow Airport in March caught fire when staff opened it Post office staff contacted police after the package was discovered and up to 100 staff employed at the sorting office were moved out when the alert was raised, RTÃ reported. The office is the National Return Letter Centre, which acts as the depot for all undeliverable mail in the country. The packages that arrived at Waterloo railway station and offices at Heathrow and London City airports on 5 and 6 of March were posted with Irish stamps and had Dublin as the return address, prompting Irish police to join the investigation. The stamps appeared to be those issued by the Irish postal service for Valentine's Day 2018, featuring a heart motif and the words ""Love Eire N"". In a statement, a spokesperson for the Metropolitan Police said it was keeping ""an open mind"" as enquiries continue. ""We are aware that those claiming responsibility have indicated five devices were sent. At this time, only four devices have been recovered,"" the statement said. ""Extensive advice has already been issued to relevant businesses and sectors to be vigilant for and report suspicious packages to police. This advice was previously sent to armed forces personnel and is being reiterated again in light of this claim."" Police Scotland said a controlled explosion was carried out as a precaution on a suspicious package found in the mailroom at Glasgow University, after several buildings had been evacuated. All packages were A4-sized white postal bags containing yellow Jiffy bags and appeared capable of igniting a small fire when opened. No-one was injured in any of the incidents in Britain. Responsibility for a car bomb outside Londonderry's court house in January was claimed by the IRA The parcel bomb incidents came almost a year after MI5 downgraded the threat posed in Britain by Irish republicans. It is currently classified as ""moderate"", meaning attacks are possible, but not likely. In Northern Ireland, the risk is greater, exemplified by a car bomb whichdetonated in Londonderryin January. All the attacks were claimed by an organisation calling itself the IRA. It is often referred to as ""the new IRA"", to distinguish it from the group which was active in Northern Ireland's troubles. It is comprised of dissidents who never accepted its namesake's ceasefire more than 20 years ago. Police on both sides of the Irish Sea have mostly been able to contain its threat. They have described it as ""a small"" organisation, perhaps with 50 or so actively engaging in terrorist activity.

"Struggling department store chain Debenhams says it is seeking a cash injection of up to Â£200m from existing lenders as it tries to fend off Sports Direct's Mike Ashley. The move would allow it to turn down Mr Ashley's offer of a Â£150m loan as part of a deal that would put him in charge. Lenders have until Thursday next week to approve the cash call, which the firm says will allow it to restructure. It also warned that shareholders could see their investment wiped out. Shareholders reacted with dismay. The company's share price fell by nearly two-thirds to 1.1p before recovering slightly. Debenhams said the move would ""provide liquidity headroom"" and ""deliver stability"" for customers and staff. The firm - which issued three profit warnings last year - is in talks with lenders over renegotiating its debts. It is also reportedlytrying to accelerate plans to close storesand is expected to close about 20 outlets this year. Mike Ashley seeks to remove Debenhams board Debenhams in profit alert as sales slide Sports Direct has a near-30% share in Debenhams. Last week, it confirmed it had offered a Â£150m loan to Debenhams as part of a deal that would make Mr Ashley chief executive. Sports Direct also wants to remove all the current members of the Debenhams board except one. Responding to Debenhams' latest move, Sports Direct reaffirmed its proposal to put Mr Ashley in control and added that it had offered to buy the retailer's Danish business, Magasin Du Nord, for Â£100m. Sports Direct said its plan ""would provide additional management and first-class leadership to Debenhams through this challenging period of restructuring, together with additional funding"". Debenhams retorted that Magasin Du Nord was a key part of the group and ""a meaningful contributor to group profits"". It added that there were ""obvious concerns with the proposal that Mike Ashley becomes CEO of Debenhams, given that Sports Direct owns our direct competitor, House of Fraser"". Debenhams said its appeal to lenders ""would allow the company to enter into new money facilities and give Debenhams the ability to pursue restructuring options to secure the future of the business"". But it also warned: ""Certain of these options - if they materialise - would result in no equity value for the company's current shareholders."" Debenhams gave no further details. However, one such option is a so-called ""pre-pack"" administration - an insolvency procedure in which a firm arranges to sell its assets to a buyer before appointing administrators to facilitate the sale. Patrick O'Brien, UK retail research director at GlobalData, said a pre-pack administration was now in prospect. He added: ""Mike Ashley's attempt to create a 'House of Debenhams' looks doomed to be an expensive failure after Debenhams revealed its restructuring plans. ""It looks likely that creditors will approve plans to take control of the company in return for Â£200m of additional financing, wiping out Sports Direct's near 30% equity stake and all other shareholders."" He said landlords would also lose out, as Debenhams would then be able to exit or renegotiate leases on its stores. Debenhams will 'consider' Ashley loan Mike Ashley seeks to remove Debenhams board Debenhams in profit alert as sales slide Debenhams may close stores this year Ashley votes Debenhams bosses off board Debenhams closure plan threatens 4,000 jobs Debenhams 'seeks to close 50 stores' Los Angeles wildfires approach Hollywood sign, with Sunset Boulevard 'in ruins' Watch: The scene across LA as firefighters attempt to contain blazes Flu numbers rise and A&E performance slips, as you share stories of NHS pressures Million year-old bubbles could solve ice age mystery 'Where do I go?'

"This video can not be played Imam Gamal Fouda, who was leading prayers, thanked the people of New Zealand ""for their tears"" New Zealand has broadcast the Islamic call to prayer and observed a two-minute silence in ceremonies to mark a week since the Christchurch attacks. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern joined thousands of mourners near the Al-Noor mosque, one of two places of worship targeted in last Friday's shootings. Imam Gamal Fouda, who led the prayers, said: ""We are broken-hearted, but we are not broken."" Fifty people were killed and dozens more wounded in the attacks. The lives lost and the world they revealed Australian Brenton Tarrant, a self-proclaimed white supremacist, has been charged with one murder and is expected to face further charges. On Thursday Ms Ardern announced a ban on all types of semi-automatic weapons. This video can not be played The victims have been remembered at events throughout the week Thousands of people have gathered in Hagley Park, near the Al-Noor mosque, to mark Friday's national day of reflection for the victims. The Muslim call to prayer, or adhan, was broadcast on national television and radio at 13:30 (00:30 GMT) and was followed by a two-minute silence.

Like thousands of others in the city of Christchurch, she's been struggling to come to terms with the horror of last week's attacks. All week advertising hoardings have been beaming positive messages back onto the streets: ""This isn't us"", ""Kia Kaha Christchurch"" and ""No room for racism here"". Friday was a chance for Christchurchers to bring those sentiments together in one place at the same time and to pay their respects to the dead. People flocked from all corners of the city and flowers and messages of sympathy were laid at the foot of the park's towering oak trees. A Maori biker gang gathered in the enclosure for Muslim prayers to offer their protection. One had a large red crucifix emblazoned on the back of his leather waistcoat. It felt symbolic of New Zealand's positive, multicultural response to the killings. When the tributes were over people started pouring out of the park, back into the city and their everyday lives.

""I know many New Zealanders wish to mark the week that has passed since the terrorist attack and to support the Muslim community as they return to mosques,"" she said. ""How we choose to reflect during the silence will be different for each of us. Everyone should do what feels right for them, wherever they are - at home, at work, at school."" One social media campaign has urged non-Muslim women in New Zealand to wear a headscarf for the day. Meanwhile, government officials worked into the night to prepare the mosque and the bodies of victims for a mass burial in Christchurch later on Friday. One person who took part said: ""All the bodies are washed. We finished around 1.30am. It was our duty. After we finished, there was a lot of emotion. People were crying and hugging."" Ms Ardern announced a ban on all types of semi-automatic weapons and assault rifles following the Christchurch attacks.

""Related parts used to convert these guns into MSSAs are also being banned, along with all high-capacity magazines."" An amnesty has been imposed so the owners of affected weapons can hand them in, and a buy-back scheme will follow. The buy-back could cost up to NZ$200m ($138m; Â£104m), but Ms Ardern said ""that is the price that we must pay to ensure the safety of our communities"".

"This video can not be played Funeral services were held on Friday for Morgan Barnard, Lauren Bullock and Connor Currie The head of the Catholic Church in Ireland has said a ""valley of tears"" has been caused by the death of three teenagers at a hotel in County Tyrone. Speaking at the funeral for Morgan Barnard, 17, Archbishop Eamon Martin described the anguish felt by relatives and friends of the children. Morgan, Lauren Bullock, 17, and Connor Currie, 16,died after a crush at the Greenvale Hotelin Cookstown. Hundreds of young people were queuing to get into the St Patrick's Day disco. In pictures: Cookstown victims laid to rest Much loved teens remembered How to talk to traumatised teens The funeral service for Morgan Barnard was the first of the three to take place on Friday Two men, including the hotel owner Michael McElhatton, were arrested on Tuesday on suspicion of manslaughter. Mr McElhatton, 52, has since been released on police bail, as has the other man, who is aged 40. Guards of honour were held at all three funerals. Among the mourners at Morgan's funeral at St Patrick's Church in Dungannon, County Tyrone, were pupils from schools in the town and neighbouring Cookstown and Coalisland. Hundreds of mourners attended the funeral service for Morgan Barnard It was a day when young people clung to everything they could to try to bring some comfort. A friend of Morgan Barnard looked at the teenager's picture on the front of the funeral order of service, shook his head, wiped a tear and said: ""We were lucky to have him."" Between them, the three young victims only lived for 50 years. There were three separate funerals in Dungannon, Donaghmore and Edendork. Many people in the area travelled between the three areas in order to be able to offer their condolences to all three families. Archbishop Martin said: ""Words fail us at times like this. ""All that really matters and makes a difference is love and friendship and compassion. ""The shocking events of Sunday last have reminded us that life is very fragile; we need to cherish every moment and always look for each other and keep each other safe,"" he added. Father Aidan McCann, the curate of Dungannon, said Morgan was ""a vivacious, charismatic and energetic young man who nobody had a bad word to say about. This video can not be played On St Patrick's Day, a crush outside a disco in Cookstown killed Lauren Bullock, Morgan Barnard and Connor Currie. ""Morgan was a person of character with a great sense of humour with an abundance of wit, always a smile on his face."" School pupils at the funeral service for Lauren at St Patrick's Church in Donaghmore, County Tyrone, wore purple ribbons in tribute to the teenager who was an accomplished cheerleader with the Euphoria Allstate Group. Friends and family members carried her pink floral coffin into the church. In his homily, Fr David Moore said St Patrick's Day 2019 would be remembered as the ""awful day when three beautiful young people were overpowered, literally, in the mad rush of our modern world and needlessly lost their lives"". Mourners at Lauren Bullock's funeral heard that she gave her time to do good for others Lauren was a girl with a positive outlook on life, he said. ""She was a girl who was happiest when she was doing things to help others and gave of herself and her time to do a good deed whenever and wherever she could,"" he added. Connor Currie's funeral at St Malachy's Church in Edendork, County Tyrone, was the last of the three to take place. Members of St Malachy's Edendork GAC, who Connor Currie played for, flank his coffin Fr Kevin Donaghy said friends had remembered how Connor ""lit up a room as he entered it and his infectious smile warmed everyone's hearts"". He said the Armagh-born teenager was a ""star on the football field"" as well as a ""conscientious student who had his sights set on doing accountancy"". ""He recently went to the McKenna Cup Final with his Tyrone top on but before leaving he let his Armagh-born mother have a peep to see that he had an Armagh top on underneath the Tyrone one,"" added the priest. ""Connor was going to be a winner either way."" The teenagers' deaths have sparked a major police investigation - the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) has identified more than 400 young people who were in the queue or the car park on the night. So far, more than 80 people have been interviewed. Det Ch Supt Raymond Murray said that while most potential witnesses had been identified, if any more were ""still out there"" they should come forward. Officers are examining CCTV footage of the incident and have appealed for any mobile phone footage or photographs of the crush to be passed to investigators. They have asked people in possession of images not to publish them online but to upload them to theMajor Incident Public Portal,external.

"Grady aged 11 months old Scientists say they have made a significant leap towards helping boys with cancer stay fertile, thanks to a baby monkey called Grady. Cancer treatment can damage a boy's undeveloped testes and leaves a third of survivors infertile in adulthood. Baby Grady is the first primate born using frozen samples of testicles taken before her dad started puberty. Experts said the technique,detailed in the journal Science,external, could soon be used in the clinic. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy can destroy someone's ability to have children. Women and girls can have eggs or ovaries frozen in order to have children after their cancer therapy is over. Adult men can have a sperm sample frozen, but this is not an option for boys who have not gone through puberty. Woman has baby using ovary frozen in childhood Scientists at the University of Pittsburgh and the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development started with five male rhesus macaques. The animals had not started puberty so their testes were not yet sperm-making factories. Then the researchers removed a testicle from each monkey, cut it up into small pieces and put the fragments on ice to cryopreserve them. Around half a year later the monkeys were made infertile. Then fragments of their preserved testes were thawed and were grafted underneath the monkey's skin. As the animals went through puberty, the testicular tissue matured and grew; when scientists looked inside ""we found that there were sperm"", said Prof Kyle Orwig, from the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine. This sperm was used to fertilise an egg and baby girl Grady was the result. Baby Grady aged 12 weeks old Just over eight out of every 10 testicular tissue grafts started producing sperm after the macaques went through puberty. The researchers then fertilised 138 eggs using a technique called intracytoplasmic sperm injection or ICSI. Around four in 10 fertilised eggs developed into early stage embryos. A total of 11 embryos were implanted into female macaques, which resulted in one pregnancy and one healthy baby. The scientists think it is close. Prof Orwig said: ""Having succeeded to produce a live-born and healthy baby, we feel that this is a technology that is ready for the human clinic."" But other researchers say they would like to see more evidence before it is tried on humans for the first time. Some boys have already had testicular tissue frozen in the hope that science would one day give them the option of having children. The biggest risk would be giving the child cancer again. If any cancerous material was hidden inside the testes, then it too would be frozen and reintroduced to the child's body along with the graft. Cancers of the blood - like leukaemia and lymphoma - as well as testicular cancer, would be problematic. Doctors would also want to be sure that the process did not affect the genetic material packaged up inside the sperm. Dr Susan Taymans, from the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, told the BBC: ""I think it is very significant. ""It is a very exciting proof of principle that this really can work, but there's a few more things I'd like to see. ""This is one live healthy baby, which is fantastic, but I think we'd like to see a couple more."" She also said: ""I'm hopeful boys whose tissue has been frozen will be able to use it in their lifetime."" Allan Pacey, professor of andrology at the University of Sheffield, said: ""This is a really excellent study, which is a great step forward, but it is important to remember that before we could attempt to use it in humans, further research would be needed to show that it is safe and that it works in the same kind of way. ""This, I think, is still a number of years away.""

"A petition on Parliament's website calling for Brexit to be cancelled has now passed more than 5.7m signatures. The petition to revoke the Article 50 withdrawal process has gained more than one million signatures since Saturday's march calling for a new EU referendum. Theresa May has stressed that the UK had already decided to leave the EU in the biggest ever democratic exercise. But European Council chief Donald Tusk has said revoking Brexit was an option if MPs again rejected the PM's deal. Brexit debate: Do petitions ever work? Why bots probably aren't gaming the 'Cancel Brexit' petition Can the UK revoke Article 50? Death threats for Brexit petition woman The UK has to decide its next move by 12 April after the EU agreed a planto delay Brexit beyond 29 March. The prime minister hopes to bring the agreement she has negotiated with the EU back to the Commons for the third time but MPs want other options to be considered as well - and onMonday backed a series of votesto find out the kind of Brexit deal they would support. In December, the European Court of Justice ruled that the UK can unilaterally revoke Article 50 of the Treaty of the European Union, the clause which allows a country to leave the bloc. This means the UK can decide to stay in the EU without the consent of the 27 other member states. Lib Dem MP Layla Moran has said the petition could ""give oxygen"" to the campaign for another Brexit referendum, a so-called People's Vote. However, speaking on Thursday night after the petition reached the two-million mark, Mrs May said the public had already had their say on EU membership. ""They voted in 2016, they voted to leave. I think the time is now to deliver for the British people, the time is now to make the decision,"" she said. Please upgrade your browser Use the list below or select a button People signing petitions on the Parliament website are asked to tick a box saying they are a British citizen or UK resident and to confirm their name, email address and postcode to sign. The petition was started in February and quickly passed the 100,000-signature threshold needed for it to be debated in Parliament. It began to attract thousands of more signatures last week and at one stage caused the petition website to crash. It reached four million signatures on Saturday, ashundreds of thousands of people marched in central London, making it the most popular to have been submitted to the parliament website. A petition for a second EU referendum in June 2016 attracted more than four million signatures and was debated in the Commons - but thousands of signatures were removed after it wasdiscovered to have been hijacked by automated bots. In January, MPsdebated whether the UK should leave the EU without a deal,after a petition calling for that got 137,731 signatures.

"The Cairngorm mountain railway opened in 2001 but has been closed all winter The private company that ran CairnGorm mountain went bust in November leaving behind a broken mountain railway and a failed plan to bring millions of pounds of much-needed investment to the snowsports centre near Aviemore. What went wrong? From the beginning some people said what was promised at CairnGorm Mountain was too good to be true. When Natural Retreats - a company until then most identified with running a holiday rentals company - took over, it promised a transformation. Publicity material said the aspiration was to host the X games, a world-famous extreme sports event, and produce multiple gold medals at the Winter Olympics by creating a world class training facility. That would have represented a major turnaround for any Scottish resort - never mind one that had struggled to overcome problems caused by the unpredictability of the weather and the need to find a revenue stream that could support a Â£20m mountain railway. When the company that ran the mountain went bust last autumn much of the focus understandably was on protecting jobs and making sure there was a ski season of some sort this winter. But we wanted to try to understand what happened, whether it was preventable and what could be learned from it. That meant unpicking a complicated web of public bodies, private companies and unmet expectations. Even working out who owned what wasn't simple. Natural Retreats ran the mountain until it went bust in November The infrastructure on the mountain - the lifts and railway - are in public hands. Highlands and Islands Enterprise owns them and the land. Until 2014 they ran the mountain through an operating company - CairnGorm Mountain Limited. That year they announced that Natural Retreats were taking over. They were a leisure company who had started off developing holiday rentals in national parks. The operating company - along with assets like vehicles and movable infrastructure on the hill - were sold for just over Â£230,000. We can see from the original tender document that financial backing was crucial to getting the contract. It says: ""The potential operator would be required to provide capital investment to support their business model. Consequently bidders will be expected to demonstrate a credible access to finance."" Thousands of people use the funicular railway to access the slopes Almost immediately bloggers who were critical of the management of the mountain started digging away. They discovered that the company had in fact been sold to Natural Assets Investments Limited (NAIL) - a company with many of the same directors as Natural Retreats. Natural Retreats had the lease to operate the mountain - but the assets had been transferred to the wider group. The funicular carries large numbers of snow sports enthusiasts to the slopes NAIL was also in debt. HIE has since said financial checks were done on both companies. In a 2014 media release, HIE welcomed Natural Retreats' decision to invest more than Â£6m in the mountain. This was the key to the deal - sell the operating company and release private capital to allow the mountain to diversify. An artist's impression of a planned revamp of CairnGorm Mountain that never materialised The hope was that there would be an investment in the ski business. But more than that the intention was to develop the summer business too - this would protect the mountain from the ups and downs of weather-affected skiing. Our research has established that this Â£6m wasn't quite what it seemed. Built at a cost of Â£26m, the funicular was first opened in 2001 When we sat down with HIE they told us that Â£4m of that was to be a loan of public money from HIE to Natural Retreats. Two years after the handover Natural Retreats still hadn't taken that up. The company came to HIE and said that they wanted to change the business model which had won them the original contract. HIE approved a new business plan but that investment didn't happen either. Highland and Islands Enterprise told us that Natural Retreats invested about Â£1m in the Day Lodge on the mountain. So the whole basis for the asset transfer was never realised. As we spoke to local people who had investigated Natural Retreats' time on the mountain it became clear the concern wasn't simply what hadn't been invested, it was also what had been taken out. Natural Assets Investment Limited and Natural Retreats share directors. There are also other leisure companies registered at Companies House where the same names come up over and over again. Their accounts show a complex system of inter-company charging. This isn't unusual or in any way wrong. The structure of an operating company and a property company that charge between each other is common in the leisure industry. But what people wanted to know was if Natural Retreats wasn't investing as originally planned, was it also taking money out? That's where the Administrator's Statement came in handy. It's a document produced by those charged with realising the assets of a company that has gone into administration and settling its debts. It said that there was a monthly ""management fee"" paid from the operating company CairnGorm Mountain Limited to Natural Retreats of Â£40,000. When we asked HIE about that they confirmed that had been negotiated at the point of handover and represented an industry standard level of fee. There were other payments in the accounts that stood out. CairnGorm Mountain Limited was paying administration charges to the wider NAIL Group. These amounted to more than Â£2m in the period 2014 to 2017. That's more than the management fees that were signed off by HIE as part of the asset transfer. What were these for? We asked HIE and they said they didn't know - but were still trying to find out. Which brings us to Natural Retreats. We had a lot of questions. In particular we wanted to know about the flow of money in and out of Cairngorm Mountain Limited. We put them all to the company - which seems to have rebadged itself as Travel Together in the past two weeks. They were not willing to answer any of them, saying that relevant information was in the public domain. They also said that ongoing investigations into the fate of the funicular meant they were not in a position to comment. There was other information in the administrator's statement that raises questions about the relationship between HIE and Natural Retreats. It makes clear what happened when Natural Retreats realised that a combination of the funicular being out of operation and other factors meant administration was inevitable. HIE entered a process where it was the sole bidder to take the operation of the mountain back over. It put in more than Â£150,000 of public money to cover the November wage bill. Then it negotiated a deal to buy the assets of CairnGorm Mountain back. At this point the funicular was out of operation and HIE was the only bidder. It paid over Â£440,000. That's almost twice the original price paid by NAIL. How would HIE explain paying double when the ski operation was struggling to cope with the loss of the funicular? They told us they were securing important assets for the future and that they had paid a fair price. They also said that the original sale had involved a transfer of a company with debts as well as assets and that was reflected in the price in 2014. The agency was clear - it's role was to protect the future viability of the mountain. HIE also told us that over the period Natural Retreats was in charge, HIE spent an additional Â£3.5m of public money on infrastructure. If the original intention of the handover was to bring private capital into the picture and relieve pressure on public funds then what's detailed in the administrator's statement, combined with what HIE told us, suggests that there was far more public cash than private cash being invested. There is one last potential twist. When Cairngorm Mountain went into administration it owed more than Â£2m to the NAIL Group. That makes the company by far the largest unsecured creditor. So whatever is realised by the administrators could largely be paid back to NAIL. Over the last week or so we've seen winter return to our mountains with a vengeance. That holds out hope for all our ski resorts, including CairnGorm. As the wider impact of CairnGorm Mountain Limited going into administration becomes clear the immediate worst case scenarios have not appeared. Jobs have been protected, skiing is happening this winter and there are negotiations under way with community groups about the potential for a community buy-out. Nevertheless, it's still not at all clear that the past four years represent anything other than a wasted opportunity for a business dependent on public money and crucial to the future of a community that desperately needs it to succeed.

In a 2014 media release, HIE welcomed Natural Retreats' decision to invest more than Â£6m in the mountain. This was the key to the deal - sell the operating company and release private capital to allow the mountain to diversify. An artist's impression of a planned revamp of CairnGorm Mountain that never materialised The hope was that there would be an investment in the ski business. But more than that the intention was to develop the summer business too - this would protect the mountain from the ups and downs of weather-affected skiing. Our research has established that this Â£6m wasn't quite what it seemed. Built at a cost of Â£26m, the funicular was first opened in 2001 When we sat down with HIE they told us that Â£4m of that was to be a loan of public money from HIE to Natural Retreats. Two years after the handover Natural Retreats still hadn't taken that up. The company came to HIE and said that they wanted to change the business model which had won them the original contract. HIE approved a new business plan but that investment didn't happen either. Highland and Islands Enterprise told us that Natural Retreats invested about Â£1m in the Day Lodge on the mountain. So the whole basis for the asset transfer was never realised. As we spoke to local people who had investigated Natural Retreats' time on the mountain it became clear the concern wasn't simply what hadn't been invested, it was also what had been taken out. Natural Assets Investment Limited and Natural Retreats share directors. There are also other leisure companies registered at Companies House where the same names come up over and over again. Their accounts show a complex system of inter-company charging. This isn't unusual or in any way wrong. The structure of an operating company and a property company that charge between each other is common in the leisure industry. But what people wanted to know was if Natural Retreats wasn't investing as originally planned, was it also taking money out? That's where the Administrator's Statement came in handy. It's a document produced by those charged with realising the assets of a company that has gone into administration and settling its debts. It said that there was a monthly ""management fee"" paid from the operating company CairnGorm Mountain Limited to Natural Retreats of Â£40,000. When we asked HIE about that they confirmed that had been negotiated at the point of handover and represented an industry standard level of fee. There were other payments in the accounts that stood out. CairnGorm Mountain Limited was paying administration charges to the wider NAIL Group. These amounted to more than Â£2m in the period 2014 to 2017. That's more than the management fees that were signed off by HIE as part of the asset transfer. What were these for? We asked HIE and they said they didn't know - but were still trying to find out. Which brings us to Natural Retreats. We had a lot of questions. In particular we wanted to know about the flow of money in and out of Cairngorm Mountain Limited. We put them all to the company - which seems to have rebadged itself as Travel Together in the past two weeks. They were not willing to answer any of them, saying that relevant information was in the public domain. They also said that ongoing investigations into the fate of the funicular meant they were not in a position to comment. There was other information in the administrator's statement that raises questions about the relationship between HIE and Natural Retreats. It makes clear what happened when Natural Retreats realised that a combination of the funicular being out of operation and other factors meant administration was inevitable. HIE entered a process where it was the sole bidder to take the operation of the mountain back over. It put in more than Â£150,000 of public money to cover the November wage bill. Then it negotiated a deal to buy the assets of CairnGorm Mountain back. At this point the funicular was out of operation and HIE was the only bidder. It paid over Â£440,000. That's almost twice the original price paid by NAIL. How would HIE explain paying double when the ski operation was struggling to cope with the loss of the funicular? They told us they were securing important assets for the future and that they had paid a fair price. They also said that the original sale had involved a transfer of a company with debts as well as assets and that was reflected in the price in 2014. The agency was clear - it's role was to protect the future viability of the mountain. HIE also told us that over the period Natural Retreats was in charge, HIE spent an additional Â£3.5m of public money on infrastructure. If the original intention of the handover was to bring private capital into the picture and relieve pressure on public funds then what's detailed in the administrator's statement, combined with what HIE told us, suggests that there was far more public cash than private cash being invested. There is one last potential twist. When Cairngorm Mountain went into administration it owed more than Â£2m to the NAIL Group. That makes the company by far the largest unsecured creditor. So whatever is realised by the administrators could largely be paid back to NAIL. Over the last week or so we've seen winter return to our mountains with a vengeance. That holds out hope for all our ski resorts, including CairnGorm. As the wider impact of CairnGorm Mountain Limited going into administration becomes clear the immediate worst case scenarios have not appeared. Jobs have been protected, skiing is happening this winter and there are negotiations under way with community groups about the potential for a community buy-out. Nevertheless, it's still not at all clear that the past four years represent anything other than a wasted opportunity for a business dependent on public money and crucial to the future of a community that desperately needs it to succeed.

"Struggling department store chain Debenhams says it is seeking a cash injection of up to Â£200m from existing lenders as it tries to fend off Sports Direct's Mike Ashley. The move would allow it to turn down Mr Ashley's offer of a Â£150m loan as part of a deal that would put him in charge. Lenders have until Thursday next week to approve the cash call, which the firm says will allow it to restructure. It also warned that shareholders could see their investment wiped out. Shareholders reacted with dismay. The company's share price fell by nearly two-thirds to 1.1p before recovering slightly. Debenhams said the move would ""provide liquidity headroom"" and ""deliver stability"" for customers and staff. The firm - which issued three profit warnings last year - is in talks with lenders over renegotiating its debts. It is also reportedlytrying to accelerate plans to close storesand is expected to close about 20 outlets this year. Mike Ashley seeks to remove Debenhams board Debenhams in profit alert as sales slide Sports Direct has a near-30% share in Debenhams. Last week, it confirmed it had offered a Â£150m loan to Debenhams as part of a deal that would make Mr Ashley chief executive. Sports Direct also wants to remove all the current members of the Debenhams board except one. Responding to Debenhams' latest move, Sports Direct reaffirmed its proposal to put Mr Ashley in control and added that it had offered to buy the retailer's Danish business, Magasin Du Nord, for Â£100m. Sports Direct said its plan ""would provide additional management and first-class leadership to Debenhams through this challenging period of restructuring, together with additional funding"". Debenhams retorted that Magasin Du Nord was a key part of the group and ""a meaningful contributor to group profits"". It added that there were ""obvious concerns with the proposal that Mike Ashley becomes CEO of Debenhams, given that Sports Direct owns our direct competitor, House of Fraser"". Debenhams said its appeal to lenders ""would allow the company to enter into new money facilities and give Debenhams the ability to pursue restructuring options to secure the future of the business"". But it also warned: ""Certain of these options - if they materialise - would result in no equity value for the company's current shareholders."" Debenhams gave no further details. However, one such option is a so-called ""pre-pack"" administration - an insolvency procedure in which a firm arranges to sell its assets to a buyer before appointing administrators to facilitate the sale. Patrick O'Brien, UK retail research director at GlobalData, said a pre-pack administration was now in prospect. He added: ""Mike Ashley's attempt to create a 'House of Debenhams' looks doomed to be an expensive failure after Debenhams revealed its restructuring plans. ""It looks likely that creditors will approve plans to take control of the company in return for Â£200m of additional financing, wiping out Sports Direct's near 30% equity stake and all other shareholders."" He said landlords would also lose out, as Debenhams would then be able to exit or renegotiate leases on its stores.

"This video can not be played Funeral services were held on Friday for Morgan Barnard, Lauren Bullock and Connor Currie The head of the Catholic Church in Ireland has said a ""valley of tears"" has been caused by the death of three teenagers at a hotel in County Tyrone. Speaking at the funeral for Morgan Barnard, 17, Archbishop Eamon Martin described the anguish felt by relatives and friends of the children. Morgan, Lauren Bullock, 17, and Connor Currie, 16,died after a crush at the Greenvale Hotelin Cookstown. Hundreds of young people were queuing to get into the St Patrick's Day disco. In pictures: Cookstown victims laid to rest Much loved teens remembered How to talk to traumatised teens The funeral service for Morgan Barnard was the first of the three to take place on Friday Two men, including the hotel owner Michael McElhatton, were arrested on Tuesday on suspicion of manslaughter. Mr McElhatton, 52, has since been released on police bail, as has the other man, who is aged 40. Guards of honour were held at all three funerals. Among the mourners at Morgan's funeral at St Patrick's Church in Dungannon, County Tyrone, were pupils from schools in the town and neighbouring Cookstown and Coalisland. Hundreds of mourners attended the funeral service for Morgan Barnard It was a day when young people clung to everything they could to try to bring some comfort. A friend of Morgan Barnard looked at the teenager's picture on the front of the funeral order of service, shook his head, wiped a tear and said: ""We were lucky to have him."" Between them, the three young victims only lived for 50 years. There were three separate funerals in Dungannon, Donaghmore and Edendork. Many people in the area travelled between the three areas in order to be able to offer their condolences to all three families. Archbishop Martin said: ""Words fail us at times like this. ""All that really matters and makes a difference is love and friendship and compassion. ""The shocking events of Sunday last have reminded us that life is very fragile; we need to cherish every moment and always look for each other and keep each other safe,"" he added. Father Aidan McCann, the curate of Dungannon, said Morgan was ""a vivacious, charismatic and energetic young man who nobody had a bad word to say about.

"Commuters across England faced widespread cancellations throughout 2018 A more exacting standard for punctuality will be brought in on UK railways next month in an attempt to improve performance. From 1 April, train times will be recorded to the minute at every stop. This is against the current measure which deems a train to be ""on time"" if it reaches its final destination within five minutes of the timetable, or 10 minutes for a long distance. Rail punctuality across the UK sank to a 13-year low in 2018. Punctuality information will let passengers get a more accurate picture of exactly how good their service is. UK rail passengers have become increasingly frustrated by delays in recent years as creaking networks, staff shortages, and industrial action have taken their toll. In the year to the middle of October 2018,trains clocked up 32 years of delays. According to the Office of Rail and Road, total delay hours have increased 22% since 2008-9, compared with a 10% increase in the number of trains running. With rail fare increases digging ever deeper into consumers' wallets, passengersdo not believe they are getting the service they are paying for. In September 2018 regulator the Office of Rail and Road said ""no-one took charge"" during timetable chaos that caused severe disruption on Britain's railways in May of that year. It blamed a lack of ""responsibility and accountability"" and said passengers were ""badly treated"". Cancellations and delays continue to plague thousands of commuters. For example, on Friday morning all of the trains coming into and going out of Waterloo, a major London transport hub, were cancelled after over-running engineering work. Industry body the Rail Delivery Group (RDG) said the punctuality information will help train operators pinpoint the causes of delays and improve their services. It won't lead to more compensation for passengers because companies will continue to be held to the standards set down in their franchise agreements, which don't take account of the new measures. However, passenger group Transport Focus welcomed the move towards greater transparency. Anthony Smith, its chief executive, said: ""Train timetables need to be a work of fact, not fiction. ""It is good to see train operators reporting true on-time performance to the minute at every station."" Train firms will publish a spread of information about their services, such as how many were early, within a minute of the timetable or within three, five, 10 or 15 minutes. The proportion of trains cancelled will also be shown. RDG chief executive Paul Plummer said: ""Every second matters to us and our customers which is why rail companies have together developed and are now using these to-the-minute measures for train punctuality at every station as part of our plan to improve the railway today. ""Record investment to upgrade the railway, including the roll out of thousands of new carriages, will continue to help improve journeys over the coming years and in the shorter term, we're using a more transparent measure of punctuality to help us cut delays and reduce disruption.""

School pupils at the funeral service for Lauren at St Patrick's Church in Donaghmore, County Tyrone, wore purple ribbons in tribute to the teenager who was an accomplished cheerleader with the Euphoria Allstate Group. Friends and family members carried her pink floral coffin into the church. In his homily, Fr David Moore said St Patrick's Day 2019 would be remembered as the ""awful day when three beautiful young people were overpowered, literally, in the mad rush of our modern world and needlessly lost their lives"". Mourners at Lauren Bullock's funeral heard that she gave her time to do good for others Lauren was a girl with a positive outlook on life, he said. ""She was a girl who was happiest when she was doing things to help others and gave of herself and her time to do a good deed whenever and wherever she could,"" he added. Connor Currie's funeral at St Malachy's Church in Edendork, County Tyrone, was the last of the three to take place. Members of St Malachy's Edendork GAC, who Connor Currie played for, flank his coffin Fr Kevin Donaghy said friends had remembered how Connor ""lit up a room as he entered it and his infectious smile warmed everyone's hearts"". He said the Armagh-born teenager was a ""star on the football field"" as well as a ""conscientious student who had his sights set on doing accountancy"". ""He recently went to the McKenna Cup Final with his Tyrone top on but before leaving he let his Armagh-born mother have a peep to see that he had an Armagh top on underneath the Tyrone one,"" added the priest. ""Connor was going to be a winner either way."" The teenagers' deaths have sparked a major police investigation - the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) has identified more than 400 young people who were in the queue or the car park on the night. So far, more than 80 people have been interviewed. Det Ch Supt Raymond Murray said that while most potential witnesses had been identified, if any more were ""still out there"" they should come forward. Officers are examining CCTV footage of the incident and have appealed for any mobile phone footage or photographs of the crush to be passed to investigators. They have asked people in possession of images not to publish them online but to upload them to theMajor Incident Public Portal,external.

"The 2017 re-discovery of the night parrot in South Australia is being disputed An Australian conservation group has been forced to retract published research on the discovery of an endangered bird. In 2017, ecologist John Young claimed to have found traces of the night parrot, one of the world's rarest birds, in the state of South Australia. His findings were published by the Australian Wildlife Conservancy (AWC). But last year the evidence was called into question by other scientists. On Friday, AWC - one of the largest conservation organisations in Australia - said it would retract his published research, after a probe found flaws. Mr Young denies any wrongdoing, telling the Australian Broadcasting Corporation:""I have no interest in any criticism."",external The night parrot had not been seen in decades, leading experts to declare it extinct. Since 2013 it has been confirmed to be in Western Australia but no other states. An independent investigation, commissioned by the AWC, and carried out by other scientists found major discrepancies in Mr Young's research. The noted ecologist had been hired by the not-for-profit group in 2016, but resigned last year in the wake of the accusations. Photos of a feather in a nest had been used as proof of the bird's presence For the 2017 discovery, he had submitted a feather, found in a zebra finch nest in Kalamurina Wildlife Sanctuary in South Australia, as proof of the parrot's presence in the remote region. However, the investigation found that photographs of the feather in the nest did not match up with the specimen later submitted to the South Australian Museum. Supposed recordings of the parrot's calls at the sanctuary were also found to be ""playback"" of publicly available recordings. As a result, the conservation group said it had to correct the public record, and retract the published research. The bird's presence in a part of Queensland, based on photographs taken by Mr Young in 2013, is now also in dispute. ""The methods used in this work were not consistent with the AWC's usual procedures,"" said chief executive Tim Allard in a statement on Friday. He added that the organisation was also retracting other records made by Mr Young in relation to other rare bird species.

"Struggling department store chain Debenhams says it is seeking a cash injection of up to Â£200m from existing lenders as it tries to fend off Sports Direct's Mike Ashley. The move would allow it to turn down Mr Ashley's offer of a Â£150m loan as part of a deal that would put him in charge. Lenders have until Thursday next week to approve the cash call, which the firm says will allow it to restructure. It also warned that shareholders could see their investment wiped out. Shareholders reacted with dismay. The company's share price fell by nearly two-thirds to 1.1p before recovering slightly. Debenhams said the move would ""provide liquidity headroom"" and ""deliver stability"" for customers and staff. The firm - which issued three profit warnings last year - is in talks with lenders over renegotiating its debts. It is also reportedlytrying to accelerate plans to close storesand is expected to close about 20 outlets this year. Mike Ashley seeks to remove Debenhams board Debenhams in profit alert as sales slide Sports Direct has a near-30% share in Debenhams. Last week, it confirmed it had offered a Â£150m loan to Debenhams as part of a deal that would make Mr Ashley chief executive. Sports Direct also wants to remove all the current members of the Debenhams board except one. Responding to Debenhams' latest move, Sports Direct reaffirmed its proposal to put Mr Ashley in control and added that it had offered to buy the retailer's Danish business, Magasin Du Nord, for Â£100m. Sports Direct said its plan ""would provide additional management and first-class leadership to Debenhams through this challenging period of restructuring, together with additional funding"". Debenhams retorted that Magasin Du Nord was a key part of the group and ""a meaningful contributor to group profits"". It added that there were ""obvious concerns with the proposal that Mike Ashley becomes CEO of Debenhams, given that Sports Direct owns our direct competitor, House of Fraser"". Debenhams said its appeal to lenders ""would allow the company to enter into new money facilities and give Debenhams the ability to pursue restructuring options to secure the future of the business"". But it also warned: ""Certain of these options - if they materialise - would result in no equity value for the company's current shareholders."" Debenhams gave no further details. However, one such option is a so-called ""pre-pack"" administration - an insolvency procedure in which a firm arranges to sell its assets to a buyer before appointing administrators to facilitate the sale. Patrick O'Brien, UK retail research director at GlobalData, said a pre-pack administration was now in prospect. He added: ""Mike Ashley's attempt to create a 'House of Debenhams' looks doomed to be an expensive failure after Debenhams revealed its restructuring plans. ""It looks likely that creditors will approve plans to take control of the company in return for Â£200m of additional financing, wiping out Sports Direct's near 30% equity stake and all other shareholders."" He said landlords would also lose out, as Debenhams would then be able to exit or renegotiate leases on its stores.

"This video can not be played Funeral services were held on Friday for Morgan Barnard, Lauren Bullock and Connor Currie The head of the Catholic Church in Ireland has said a ""valley of tears"" has been caused by the death of three teenagers at a hotel in County Tyrone. Speaking at the funeral for Morgan Barnard, 17, Archbishop Eamon Martin described the anguish felt by relatives and friends of the children. Morgan, Lauren Bullock, 17, and Connor Currie, 16,died after a crush at the Greenvale Hotelin Cookstown. Hundreds of young people were queuing to get into the St Patrick's Day disco. In pictures: Cookstown victims laid to rest Much loved teens remembered How to talk to traumatised teens The funeral service for Morgan Barnard was the first of the three to take place on Friday Two men, including the hotel owner Michael McElhatton, were arrested on Tuesday on suspicion of manslaughter. Mr McElhatton, 52, has since been released on police bail, as has the other man, who is aged 40. Guards of honour were held at all three funerals. Among the mourners at Morgan's funeral at St Patrick's Church in Dungannon, County Tyrone, were pupils from schools in the town and neighbouring Cookstown and Coalisland. Hundreds of mourners attended the funeral service for Morgan Barnard It was a day when young people clung to everything they could to try to bring some comfort. A friend of Morgan Barnard looked at the teenager's picture on the front of the funeral order of service, shook his head, wiped a tear and said: ""We were lucky to have him."" Between them, the three young victims only lived for 50 years. There were three separate funerals in Dungannon, Donaghmore and Edendork. Many people in the area travelled between the three areas in order to be able to offer their condolences to all three families. Archbishop Martin said: ""Words fail us at times like this. ""All that really matters and makes a difference is love and friendship and compassion. ""The shocking events of Sunday last have reminded us that life is very fragile; we need to cherish every moment and always look for each other and keep each other safe,"" he added. Father Aidan McCann, the curate of Dungannon, said Morgan was ""a vivacious, charismatic and energetic young man who nobody had a bad word to say about.

"Adam Price said European funding for Wales must be guaranteed Wales should hold a referendum on independence if a series of demands are not met after Brexit, Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price has said. In a speech to his party's spring conference, he said European funding for Wales must be guaranteed. Mr Price also called for cuts in VAT for tourism and construction, and for the devolution of powers over air passenger duty. Wales should also control its own migration policy, the leader added. Plaid Cymru needs a rebrand, says study Who is Adam Price? Adam Price replaces Wood as Plaid leader ""If you deny us these reasonable demands then we only have one left,"" Mr Price said. ""And that's the right to ask our people whether we would be better to take control of our future as an independent member of a European Union, not a second-class region in a failing British state."" The Plaid leader called for ""every penny"" of the Â£2.5bn structural funds Wales would have expected in the next EU funding period to be replaced, plus matching funds to provide a Â£5bn fund for ""a fighting chance for us to rebuild our own fortunes"". He said Plaid wanted Wales to join the EU as an independent member state with three times as many MEPs as it currently had and a place at the top table. This was a ""dangerous"" time for Wales, said Mr Price, whose party wants another Brexit referendum. Comparing Jeremy Corbyn and Theresa May, he said: ""There is little to distinguish between them in this toxic tango of pathetic procrastination."" Plaid Cymru has four MPs in Westminster, and ten AMs in the National Assembly for Wales And in an attack on Mark Drakeford, he accused Wales' first minister of rowing back on a commitment to support a second referendum on leaving the EU. ""Mark Drakeford doesn't do demands. He does concessions instead,"" Mr Price said. The conference in Bangor heard a series of policy proposals from the leader. A Plaid government after the next assembly elections in 2021 would pass laws guaranteeing patients' rights to be treated on time by the NHS. On the economy, Plaid would set up two agencies outside the government to attract investment and help businesses. And teachers would see less interference from the government, making sure they are ""better qualified and better paid"". While he wanted to breakthrough outside its traditional heartlands, Mr Price said Plaid would never take its core support for granted as Labour had done. Wales faced big changes in the form of climate change, automation and an ageing population, he claimed. Mark Drakeford was accused of rowing back on a commitment to support a second referendum A Plaid government would meet those by including a minister for the future in the cabinet, he said. ""But friends, if we want to change Wales we have to change too,"" Mr Price added. ""If Wales is going to change, Plaid Cymru has to become a party that wins. ""We have to be more open and look outwards, be closer to the people and attract more voters."" The party was setting up a new campaigns unit, had created a think tank, and promised more co-ordination between politicians in Cardiff Bay and Westminster. Mr Price also paid tribute to Steffan Lewis, the Plaid AM who died in January, saying his legacy was ""an inspiration to us every step we take until we claim our freedom in his name"". Jonathan Edwards said Plaid Cymru ""was not in the business of wanting to be a junior party to the Labour Party"" Earlier, Adam Price ruled out entering a coalition with either Labour or the Conservatives to form a future Welsh Government. He said voters faced a choice between him or the incumbent - Labour's Mark Drakeford - as first minister at the next assembly election in 2021. Plaid and Labour have worked together in the past in the assembly, forming a coalition government from 2007 to 2011. In a BBC Wales interview, Plaid Cymru MP Jonathan Edwards said his party ""was not in the business of wanting to be a junior party to the Labour Party any more in Wales"". Speaking to BBC Radio Wales later, Mr Price insisted the MP was not advocating a Tory-Plaid coalition, but was saying that ""Labour are as bad as the Conservatives in terms of their negative impact on people's lives in Wales"". In his interview, Mr Edwards had welcomed proposals to rename and rebrand Plaid Cymru. The idea had been put forward by Mr Price in his leadership campaign last year and supported by a report he commissioned from former SNP MP Angus Robertson which was published this month. However, Mr Price said on Friday: ""We are not going to change the name of Plaid Cymru, but what we have to do is actually change the conversation we're having with the Welsh people.""

"The Golan Heights has a political and strategic significance which belies its size President Donald Trump has overturned decades of US policy by saying it is time to recognise Israel's sovereignty over the occupied Golan Heights, which it captured from Syria in 1967. In a tweet, Mr Trump declared that the plateau was of""critical strategic and security importance to the State of Israel and regional stability"",external. Israel annexed the Golan in 1981 in a move not recognised internationally. Syria, which has sought to regain the region, has so far made no comments. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu - who has warned about the ""military entrenchment"" of his country's arch-enemy Iran in Syria and has ordered air strikes in an attempt to thwart it -tweeted his thanks to Mr Trump,external. ""At a time when Iran seeks to use Syria as a platform to destroy Israel, President Trump boldly recognises Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights,"" he wrote. Richard Haass, a former senior US state department official who is now president of the Council on Foreign Relations think-tank, said he ""strongly disagreed"" with Mr Trump. He said such recognising Israeli sovereignty would violate a UN Security Council resolution, ""which rules out acquiring territory by war"". What Trumpâs Golan Heights move really meansâ Why are the Golan Heights so important? The president's declaration comes as Mr Netanyahu faces a closely fought general election on 9 April, as well as a series of possible corruption charges. In 2017, Mr Trump recognised Jerusalem as Israel's capital and ordered the relocation of the US embassy to the city from Tel Aviv. The decision was condemned by Palestinians, who want East Jerusalem to be the capital of a future Palestinian state, and the UN General Assembly demanded its cancellation. Was President Trump's tweet a surprise for even his closest aides? The press travelling with the Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was waiting at Prime Minister Netanyahu's house to hear from both men, when word of Mr Trump's Golan decision came through. They delayed their appearance long enough for us to wonder whether they were scrambling to formulate a response. But if the announcement came as a surprise, it was a good surprise for Mr Netanyahu - ""I'm so excited"" were his first words to us. And the surprise would have been in the timing, not the substance, because the idea of the US recognising Israel's sovereignty over the Golan has been under active consideration in the Trump administration for some time. Israel has gained traction in the White House and parts of Congress by arguing that Iran is using Syria as a base from which to target Israel, with the Golan Heights as the front line. But the formal US recognition doesn't change anything on the ground: Israel was already acting with full military authority. So critics have concluded this was a blatant attempt to give Mr Netanyahu a boost in a hotly-contested election. If so, it's one that violates important principles of international law, they say: Mr Trump has endorsed the seizure of territory, and will have no moral authority to criticise Russia for doing so in Ukraine's Crimea. The region is located about 60km (40 miles) south-west of the Syrian capital, Damascus, and covers about 1,000 sq km (400 sq miles). Israel seized most of the Golan from Syria in the closing stages of the 1967 Middle East war, and thwarted a Syrian attempt to retake the region during the 1973 war. The two countries agreed a disengagement plan the following year that involved the creation of a 70km-long (44-mile) demilitarised zone patrolled by a United Nations observer force. But they remained technically in a state of war. Syria will not agree a peace deal with Israel unless it withdraws from the whole of the Golan In 1981, Israel's parliament passed legislation applying Israeli ""law, jurisdiction, and administration"" to the Golan, in effect annexing the territory. But the international community did not recognise the move and maintained that the Golan was occupied Syrian territory.UN Security Council Resolution 497 declared the Israeli decision ""null and void and without international legal effect"",external. Three years ago, when former President Barack Obama was in office,the US voted in favour of a Security Council statement expressing deep concern that Mr Netanyahu had declared Israel would never relinquish the Golan,external. Syria has always insisted that it will not agree a peace deal with Israel unless it withdraws from the whole of the Golan. The last US-brokered direct peace talks broke down in 2000, while Turkey mediated in indirect talks in 2008. There are more than 30 Israeli settlements in the Golan, which are home to an estimated 20,000 people. The settlements are considered illegal under international law, although Israel disputes this. The settlers live alongside some 20,000 Syrians, most of them Druze Arabs, who did not flee when the Golan was captured. Trumplomacy on Golan - what does it mean?

"Ride-hailing firm Uber will list on the New York Stock Exchange, according to reports, in one of the most anticipated stock debuts of the year. The decision to opt for the Wall Street exchange over the tech-heavy Nasdaq was first reported by Bloomberg, citing sources. It comes as smaller, ride-sharing rival Lyft prepares to list on the Nasdaq. Uber is expected to launch its initial public offering (IPO) in April and may be valued as high as $120bn (Â£91.4bn). The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the reports it would list on the New York Stock Exchange. Other major technology companies including Google, Apple and Facebook trade on the Nasdaq. But the New York Stock Exchange has secured some of world's biggest IPOs including Alibaba and General Motors. Uber loss tops $1bn ahead of planned IPO Lyft losses grow ahead of $25bn float Uber 'to focus on bikes over cars' Uber's IPO come as investors have shown strong appetite for new stock listings. Shares in denim iconLevi Strauss surged on its return to the stock marketafter 34 years. The price shot higher immediately after Wall Street opened - and closed up 31.8% - valuing the company at $8.7bn. Analysts said the success of the listing bodes well for investor appetite for other flotations planned this year, including Pinterest, Airbnb, Slack and Uber. Uber has been controversial for disrupting the taxi industry in more than 60 countries. It continues to face opposition from both private hire drivers and regulators in several jurisdictions. The ride-hailing taxi app company has also faced legal action in the UK and US over itsclassification of drivers as self-employed contractors, rather than as workers. A series of scandals dogged Uber in 2017, includingsexual harassment claimsmade by female employees, data breaches, the use of illicit software to thwart government regulators, and theforced resignation of its chief executive Travis Kalanick.

"This video can not be played It took firefighters hours to bring the blaze at the plant under control The death toll in a huge blast at a chemical plant in eastern China has jumped to 47, with 90 badly injured, according to state news agency Xinhua. Many neighbouring factories inside the industrial park caught fire after the explosion. China's earthquake administration reported a tremor equivalent to 2.2-magnitude at the time of the blast. The death toll makes it one of the country's worst industrial accidents in recent years. The blast happened at about 14:50 local time (06:50 GMT) on Thursday at a plant in Yancheng, run by Tianjiayi Chemical. According to Xinhua, a total of 640 people were sent to hospital. Many were in critical condition and dozens had severe injuries, the agency reports. The scale of the destruction is clear Hundreds were injured in the explosion, which was reportedly started by a fire at the plant Images of the site showed a fireball exploding, billowing clouds enveloping the area, injured people, and damage to buildings. The blast was so powerful that it knocked down factory buildings some distance away, trapping workers, according to local media. Staff at the Henglida Chemical Factory, 3km (1.8 miles) from the explosion, said its roof collapsed as they fled, and windows and doors were blown out. Provincial authorities said firefighters had to be brought in from across the province. The fire was brought under control at around 03:00 local time on Friday, state TV said. The cause of the accident is under investigation One woman, who gave her surname as Xiang, said she had been concerned about safety and pollution levels at the plant for some time. ""We knew we'd be blown up one day,"" said told AFP. Reuters quoted local officials as saying there had been no abnormalities detected at the site before the blast, but that the province would be conducting emergency inspections of other chemical producers and warehouses. The blast blew out windows of buildings across a wide area Industrial accidents ranging from factory fires to mining disasters are common in China, often due to poorly enforced safety standards. The biggest accident in recent years wasthe August 2015 Tianjin explosion, which killed more than 160 people and injured nearly 1,000. The exact cause of Thursday's explosion is still under investigation. Tianjiayi Chemical, founded in 2007, has received six government penalties in the past over waste management and air pollution, according to the South China Morning Post. President Xi Jinping has called for an ""all-out effort"" to aid the injured and said authorities must learn lessons from the blast prevent future accidents.

"The office was opened with great fanfare in September 2018 North Korea has withdrawn from the inter-Korean liaison office which was opened amid a warming of ties last year to facilitate talks with the South. Seoul said it was contacted on Friday and informed that the North's staff would be leaving later in the day. It has expressed its regret at the decision and is urging staff from the North to return as soon as possible. The pullout follows a failed summit between the US and North Korean leaders in Hanoi last month. The liaison office, located in the North Korean border city of Kaesong, had allowed officials from North and South Korea to communicate on a regular basis for the first time since the Korean War. It is meant to be staffed by up to 20 people from each side. When the office was opened in September 2018, it was hailed as representing a significant step forward in inter-Korean relations. The two sides had in the past communicated by fax or special phone lines, which would often be cut when relations soured. What to make of the Hanoi summit collapse? US threw away 'golden opportunity' - N Korea North Korea crisis in 300 words At the time, Seoul's Unification Minister said it would allow for direct discussion of any issues ""24 hours, 365 days"". Since last month's failed summit in Vietnam between the US and North Korean leaders, Pyongyang has warned that it could resume missile and nuclear testing. Vice Foreign Minister Choe Son-hui said earlier this month that Washington threw away ""a golden opportunity"" at the summit. This video can not be played BBC's Laura Bicker explains why Trump the 'biggest loser' from the summit President Trump had said at the time that Mr Kim had asked for the removal of all sanctions - which the US could not agree to. But Ms Choe said that the North had only asked for five key economic sanctions to be lifted. US officials have insisted that diplomacy is still ""alive"". President Moon had hoped his diplomatic relationship with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un would survive even if talks between the US and the North broke down. At the moment, this position looks questionable. Mr Moon was counting on his skills as a mediator to try to get US-North Korea talks back on track. But Pyongyang now appears unwilling to talk to Seoul and Mr Moon may not have the influence he needs to get Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un back to the negotiating table. North Korea may also be asking itself - what is the point of talking to the South? Before the Trump-Kim summit in Hanoi, the two sides were discussing ways to develop economic ties. South Korea had hoped to ask for sanctions exemptions from the US to take part in part in various projects, but Donald Trump has made it clear that will not be acceptable. Pyongyang concluded in a recent newspaper editorial that South Korea can do nothing without US approval. This announcement will also test the patience of South Korean people. They watched the soaring rhetoric between the two Korean leaders as they held hands during their historic summits last year. Many started to believe, that after 70 years of false hope, this time would be different.  But North Korea is now walking away from the pledges it made and this latest development will be seen by many as a sign that peace is once again a distant prospect.

"The ferry was on its way to this tourist island upstream from the city centre Almost 100 people are reported to have died after a ferry sank in the Tigris river in Iraq's city of Mosul. Most of the victims were women and children, the interior ministry said. It is thought nearly 200 people were on board. The ferry was heading towards a tourist island as part of new year celebrations. Mosul's civil defence agency reportedly said most on board could not swim.

The vessel was on its way to Umm Rabaen island, a tourist area about 4km (2.5 miles) upstream and north of the city centre. People across the region are celebrating Nowruz, the new year festival.

"This video can not be played Theresa May: ""I hope we can all agree we are now at the moment of decision"" EU leaders have agreed on a plan to delay the Article 50 process, postponing Brexit beyond 29 March. The UK will be offered a delay until 22 May, if MPs approve the withdrawal deal negotiated with the EU next week. If they do not, the EU will back a shorter delay until 12 April, allowing the UK time to get the deal through or to ""indicate a way forward"". Mrs May said there was now a ""clear choice"" facing UK MPs, who could vote for a third time on her deal next week. They could back the withdrawal deal, deliver on the referendum and leave the EU in ""an orderly manner"" or face the prospect of having to stand candidates in the European Parliamentary elections, three years after the UK voted to leave the EU. She said she would be ""working hard to build support for getting the deal through"". She said she had ""expressed frustration"" in her speech last night, in which she blamed MPs for the delay, but added ""I know that MPs are frustrated too"" and she was ""very grateful"" to those who had supported the deal. ""I will make every effort to make sure we can leave with a deal and move our country forward,"" she said. As it happened: EU leaders agree Brexit delay 'Cancel Brexit' petition passes 2m signatures Your really simple guide to Brexit Brexit: What could happen next? She also dismissed calls to revoke Article 50 - as a petition calling for that on the Parliament website attracted more than two million signatures - saying people had voted to leave and were told their decision would be respected.

In a press conference with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, European Council President Donald Tusk said that, until 12 April - by when the UK would have to indicate whether it would stand candidates in the 2019 European Parliament elections - ""all options remain on the table ... the UK government will still have a chance of a deal, no deal, a long extension or revoking Article 50"". If the UK has not decided by 12 April whether to take part in the elections the ""option of a long extension will automatically become impossible"", he said. He added that the atmosphere was ""much better than I had expected"" among EU leaders in discussions and he was now ""much more optimistic"". Mr Juncker said the European Commission had ""worked tirelessly"" to negotiate the withdrawal deal and respond to requests from the UK for further reassurances about keeping the Northern Irish border open.Legally-binding assurances agreed in Strasbourg last weekhad been endorsed, he added. ""This closes and completes the full package. There is no more that we can have."" Discussions ran late into the evening on Thursday amid reports of disagreement between the 27 other EU leaders about the details. They are understood to have discussed potential dates of 7 May or a longer delay until the end of the year. What will EU leaders do if UK MPs reject the deal for a third time? By Reality Check's Chris Morris It's been clear for some time that EU leaders were prepared to offer a short extension of the Article 50 process. But there have been different views about how long ""short"" should be. Now we know. If the UK doesn't take part in European elections, a strict interpretation of the law rules out an extension until the end of June, which is what the Prime Minister had initially requested. That's why the 27 EU leaders offered a possible extension until 22 May, the day before voting in the elections begins. Such an extension is only on offer, though, if UK MPs vote for the Brexit deal in the House of Commons next week. And EU leaders know the numbers there don't look good for the government. So their second offer is a much shorter extension until 12 April, by which time the UK would have to legislate for holding elections in May. The government has insisted that it has no intention of taking part in the elections. But the language used by the EU keeps the possibility of UK participation open. That means that a much longer extension has not been ruled out, even though that too is an idea that has been rejected by Theresa May in the past. So the legal and political calculations that surround the EU's offer are complex, and the outcome is difficult to predict. But one thing is clear - barring dramatic developments, it confirms that the UK will not be leaving the EU on 29 March as originally intended.

"A petition calling for Theresa May to cancel Brexit by revoking Article 50 has passed two million signatures. Parliament'spetitions committee tweeted,externalthat the rate of signatures was ""the highest the site has ever had to deal with"", after the website crashed. EU leaders in Brussels havereached agreement on a plan to delay Brexit beyond 29 March. Downing Street said the prime minister ""has said many times she will not countenance revoking Article 50"". The PM's spokesman added: ""The PM has long been clear that failing to deliver on the referendum result would be a failure of democracy and a failure she wouldn't countenance."" Revoke Article 50 has been trending on Twitter as people were urged to sign it. At one point, the petitions committee said there were nearly 2,000 signatures a minute. It latertweeted,externalthat sudden spikes in numbers continued to cause intermittent problems with the site. It also said validation emails were taking longer than usual to get through. The petition'sheat map,externalshows the constituencies with the highest number of signatories, including seats in Bristol, Edinburgh, Manchester, Oxford, London, Cambridge and Brighton. May 'hopes' UK will leave EU with a deal How could Brexit be delayed? Brexit: What could happen next? It is not the most popular ever on the Parliament website. A petition for a second EU referendum in June 2016 attracted more than four million signatures and was debated in the Commons - but thousands of signatures were removed after it wasdiscovered to have been hijacked by automated bots. People signing petitions on the Parliament website are asked to tick a box saying they are a British citizen or UK resident and to confirm their name, email address, and postcode to sign. Data from the petitions website on Thursday evening suggested 1.3m signatures were from people who said they were from the UK, 10,000 from France, nearly 6,000 from Spain and more than 4,000 from Germany, among others. A Commons spokesman said signature patterns are investigated to check for fraudulent activity and suspect signatures are removed, including those that are ""clearly bots"". He added: ""Anyone who is a UK resident or a British citizen can sign a petition. This includes British citizens living overseas."" By BBC political reporter Brian Wheeler Petitions on the Parliament website rarely lead to a change in the law. They are not even guaranteed to lead to a debate in Parliament - they only get considered for debate if they reach 100,000 signatures. The petitions committee rejects them if it believes the UK government can't do anything about the issue. But what petitions can do is put an issue on the political radar - and that is what appears to have happened with the petition to revoke Article 50. It was previously something of a taboo subject at Westminster. Even the most ardent anti-Brexiteers know it would be political suicide for any prime minister to overturn a referendum result without going back to the people. But some Remainer MPs are now calling on social media for the government to do just that. Earlier Commons leader Andrea Leadsom dismissed the petition as not being on the same scale as the pro-Brexit vote in the 2016 referendum. ""Should it reach 17.4 million respondents then I am sure there will be a very clear case for taking action,"" she told MPs. She added: ""It's absolutely right that people do have the opportunity to put their views and that can then spark yet another Brexit debate."" In December, the European Court of Justice ruled that the UK can unilaterally revoke Article 50 of the Treaty of the European Union. This means the UK can decide to stay in the EU without the consent of the 27 other member states. Few MPs have mentioned this as a potential option so far. Please upgrade your browser Use the list below or select a button The petition has long since passed the 100,000 signatures that means it will be considered for debate. Margaret Anne Georgiadou, who started the petition, told the BBC: ""I became like every other Remainer - very frustrated that we've been silenced and ignored for so long. ""So I think now it's almost like a dam bursting, because we've been held back in a sense - it's almost like last chance saloon now."" She said the petition ""didn't do very well for a week"". ""I nearly gave up but then I contacted a lot of people and it took off,"" she added. In January, MPsdebated whether the UK should leave the EU without a deal,after a petition calling for that got 371,673 signatures. MPs have been sharing the revoke Article 50 petition on social media, including Lib Dem Brexit spokesman Tom Brake, who said Mrs May's ""cliff-edge ultimatum"" had led ""hundreds of thousands"" to sign.

Pete Wishart, who was among a number of SNP MPs who shared the petition, called on the public to sign and ""end the madness"". And Labour MP Neil Coyle urged the public to sign. But Conservative MP Andrew Bowie said the only way to rule out a no-deal Brexit ""at all"" was to back the prime minister's deal. A House of Commons spokesperson said the site crashed on Thursday morning because of ""a large and sustained load on the system"". The petition reads: ""The government repeatedly claims exiting the EU is 'the will of the people'. ""We need to put a stop to this claim by proving the strength of public support now, for remaining in the EU. A People's Vote may not happen - so vote now."" The government will have a third try at getting MPs to back Theresa May's EU withdrawal deal in a Commons vote next week, but only if it thinks it has enough support to win. At the same time, a cross-party group of MPs will try to give Parliament control of Brexit by allowing a series of ""indicative"" votes on alternatives to the PM's deal. Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt insisted MPs only had a ""limited"" range of options ""if we are in the same situation this time next week"". He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""Parliament could vote to revoke Article 50, which is cancelling the Brexit process. I think that's highly unlikely."" He said the other, more likely, options were leaving without a deal, or having a longer extension granted at an emergency EU summit, but with ""onerous conditions"". ""The choice that we have now is one of resolving this issue or extreme unpredictability,"" he said. What happens now that a deal's been done? How does another Brexit delay work?

"This video can not be played Funeral services were held on Friday for Morgan Barnard, Lauren Bullock and Connor Currie The head of the Catholic Church in Ireland has said a ""valley of tears"" has been caused by the death of three teenagers at a hotel in County Tyrone. Speaking at the funeral for Morgan Barnard, 17, Archbishop Eamon Martin described the anguish felt by relatives and friends of the children. Morgan, Lauren Bullock, 17, and Connor Currie, 16,died after a crush at the Greenvale Hotelin Cookstown. Hundreds of young people were queuing to get into the St Patrick's Day disco. In pictures: Cookstown victims laid to rest Much loved teens remembered How to talk to traumatised teens The funeral service for Morgan Barnard was the first of the three to take place on Friday Two men, including the hotel owner Michael McElhatton, were arrested on Tuesday on suspicion of manslaughter. Mr McElhatton, 52, has since been released on police bail, as has the other man, who is aged 40. Guards of honour were held at all three funerals. Among the mourners at Morgan's funeral at St Patrick's Church in Dungannon, County Tyrone, were pupils from schools in the town and neighbouring Cookstown and Coalisland. Hundreds of mourners attended the funeral service for Morgan Barnard It was a day when young people clung to everything they could to try to bring some comfort. A friend of Morgan Barnard looked at the teenager's picture on the front of the funeral order of service, shook his head, wiped a tear and said: ""We were lucky to have him."" Between them, the three young victims only lived for 50 years. There were three separate funerals in Dungannon, Donaghmore and Edendork. Many people in the area travelled between the three areas in order to be able to offer their condolences to all three families. Archbishop Martin said: ""Words fail us at times like this. ""All that really matters and makes a difference is love and friendship and compassion. ""The shocking events of Sunday last have reminded us that life is very fragile; we need to cherish every moment and always look for each other and keep each other safe,"" he added. Father Aidan McCann, the curate of Dungannon, said Morgan was ""a vivacious, charismatic and energetic young man who nobody had a bad word to say about. This video can not be played On St Patrick's Day, a crush outside a disco in Cookstown killed Lauren Bullock, Morgan Barnard and Connor Currie. ""Morgan was a person of character with a great sense of humour with an abundance of wit, always a smile on his face."" School pupils at the funeral service for Lauren at St Patrick's Church in Donaghmore, County Tyrone, wore purple ribbons in tribute to the teenager who was an accomplished cheerleader with the Euphoria Allstate Group. Friends and family members carried her pink floral coffin into the church. In his homily, Fr David Moore said St Patrick's Day 2019 would be remembered as the ""awful day when three beautiful young people were overpowered, literally, in the mad rush of our modern world and needlessly lost their lives"". Mourners at Lauren Bullock's funeral heard that she gave her time to do good for others Lauren was a girl with a positive outlook on life, he said. ""She was a girl who was happiest when she was doing things to help others and gave of herself and her time to do a good deed whenever and wherever she could,"" he added. Connor Currie's funeral at St Malachy's Church in Edendork, County Tyrone, was the last of the three to take place. Members of St Malachy's Edendork GAC, who Connor Currie played for, flank his coffin Fr Kevin Donaghy said friends had remembered how Connor ""lit up a room as he entered it and his infectious smile warmed everyone's hearts"". He said the Armagh-born teenager was a ""star on the football field"" as well as a ""conscientious student who had his sights set on doing accountancy"". ""He recently went to the McKenna Cup Final with his Tyrone top on but before leaving he let his Armagh-born mother have a peep to see that he had an Armagh top on underneath the Tyrone one,"" added the priest. ""Connor was going to be a winner either way."" The teenagers' deaths have sparked a major police investigation - the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) has identified more than 400 young people who were in the queue or the car park on the night. So far, more than 80 people have been interviewed. Det Ch Supt Raymond Murray said that while most potential witnesses had been identified, if any more were ""still out there"" they should come forward. Officers are examining CCTV footage of the incident and have appealed for any mobile phone footage or photographs of the crush to be passed to investigators. They have asked people in possession of images not to publish them online but to upload them to theMajor Incident Public Portal,external.

"Ride-hailing firm Uber will list on the New York Stock Exchange, according to reports, in one of the most anticipated stock debuts of the year. The decision to opt for the Wall Street exchange over the tech-heavy Nasdaq was first reported by Bloomberg, citing sources. It comes as smaller, ride-sharing rival Lyft prepares to list on the Nasdaq. Uber is expected to launch its initial public offering (IPO) in April and may be valued as high as $120bn (Â£91.4bn). The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the reports it would list on the New York Stock Exchange. Other major technology companies including Google, Apple and Facebook trade on the Nasdaq. But the New York Stock Exchange has secured some of world's biggest IPOs including Alibaba and General Motors. Uber loss tops $1bn ahead of planned IPO Lyft losses grow ahead of $25bn float Uber 'to focus on bikes over cars' Uber's IPO come as investors have shown strong appetite for new stock listings. Shares in denim iconLevi Strauss surged on its return to the stock marketafter 34 years. The price shot higher immediately after Wall Street opened - and closed up 31.8% - valuing the company at $8.7bn. Analysts said the success of the listing bodes well for investor appetite for other flotations planned this year, including Pinterest, Airbnb, Slack and Uber. Uber has been controversial for disrupting the taxi industry in more than 60 countries. It continues to face opposition from both private hire drivers and regulators in several jurisdictions. The ride-hailing taxi app company has also faced legal action in the UK and US over itsclassification of drivers as self-employed contractors, rather than as workers. A series of scandals dogged Uber in 2017, includingsexual harassment claimsmade by female employees, data breaches, the use of illicit software to thwart government regulators, and theforced resignation of its chief executive Travis Kalanick.

"The ferry was on its way to this tourist island upstream from the city centre Almost 100 people are reported to have died after a ferry sank in the Tigris river in Iraq's city of Mosul. Most of the victims were women and children, the interior ministry said. It is thought nearly 200 people were on board. The ferry was heading towards a tourist island as part of new year celebrations. Mosul's civil defence agency reportedly said most on board could not swim. At least 19 children and 61 women were among the 94 people said to have died, and 55 people were rescued. The vessel was on its way to Umm Rabaen island, a tourist area about 4km (2.5 miles) upstream and north of the city centre. People across the region are celebrating Nowruz, the new year festival. Footage shows the ferry tilting sharply to the right and taking on water, before flipping over entirely and being dragged swiftly downstream by the fast-flowing river. Images on social media showed the upturned vessel and people floating in the current. ""It was carrying too many passengers, so the water began to rush onboard and the ferry became heavier and overturned,"" one passenger told AFP news agency. ""With my own eyes I saw dead children in the water."" Ambulances and helicopters arrived to help survivors and search for the bodies of those who died. Authorities had reportedly warned people about rising water levels as the gates of the Mosul dam had been opened, and some are accusing the ship operator of ignoring the advice. Iraq's justice ministry reportedly ordered the arrest of nine ferry company workers, and barred the ship's owners and the owners of the tourist site from leaving Iraq. Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi meanwhile has ordered an investigation ""to determine responsibilities"". In a statementMr Mahdi said he was following the story ""with pain and sadness"",external, and had ordered ""all state efforts"" to find survivors and treat victims. The prime minister later toured a hospital and a morgue in the city, and declared three days of national mourning. Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert,the special representative for Iraq of the United Nations secretary general, said it was a ""terrible tragedy"",external. ""Our hearts go out to the families and relatives of the victims,"" she said in a statement. However, local information accountMosul Eye reports that security forces are trying to arrest journalists reporting on the ferry sinking,external. Iraqi soldiers helped join the search for survivors So far dozens of people have been saved from the waters People are celebrating Nowruz, the Kurdish new year festival Mosul lies 400 km (250 miles) north of Iraq's capital Baghdad on the river Tigris, and is home to up to 2 million people. The city was captured by the Islamic State group in June 2014 and became its de-facto capital. It was not liberated until July 2017 after a nine-month battle that left large parts of the city in ruins.

"This video can not be played ""I hope we can all agree we are now at the moment of decision"" Theresa May has been granted an extra two weeks to come up with a Brexit solution after talks with EU leaders. The UK's departure date had originally been set for 29 March. If Mrs May can get her withdrawal deal through Parliament next week, that date will be pushed back to 22 May to give time to pass the necessary legislation. If the prime minister can't get the deal through, the UK will have to propose a way forward by 12 April for EU leaders to consider. European Council President Donald Tusk said all Brexit options would remain open until then. Reaction after EU leaders agree Brexit delay Nigel Farage back as Brexit Party leader Brexit: What just happened? ""The UK government will still have a choice between a deal, no deal, a long extension or revoking Article 50,"" he said. ""The 12 April is a key date in terms of the UK deciding whether to hold European Parliament elections. ""If it has not decided to do so by then, the option of long extension will automatically become impossible."" Mrs May ruled out revoking Article 50, which would cancel Brexit, and she also said ""it would be wrong"" to ask Britons to vote for candidates for the elections to the European Parliament, due to be held from 23-26 May, three years after they voted to leave the EU. The UK's departure date is still written in to law as next Friday, 29 March. 29 March:Current Brexit date in UK law 12 April:If MPs do not approve the withdrawal deal next week - ""all options will remain open"" until this date. The UK must propose a way forward before this date for consideration by EU leaders. 22 May:If MPs do approve the deal next week, Brexit will be delayed until this date 23-26 May:European Parliamentary elections are held across member states EU wins some Brexit breathing space Stop Brexit petition tops 3m signatures Brexitcast: Tres Spikey Mrs May is expected to table secondary legislation - that has to go through the Commons and the Lords by next Friday - to remove 29 March from UK law. But Downing Street sources say an agreement with the EU to extend the Brexit deadline would be a piece of international law and would take precedence even if Parliament rejected it. Mrs May said MPs had a ""clear choice"". Speaking on Thursday, after waiting for the 27 other EU countries to make their decision at a summit in Brussels, the prime minister said she would now be ""working hard to build support for getting the deal through"". The withdrawal deal, negotiated over two years between the UK and EU, sets out the terms of the UK's departure from the bloc, including the ""divorce bill"", the transition period, citizens' rights and the controversial ""backstop"" arrangements, aimed at preventing a return to border checks between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. But it must be approved by UK MPs, who have already rejected it twice by large margins. MPs are expected to vote for a third time on it next week,despite Commons Speaker John Bercow saying what is put forward must be substantially different to be voted on. Theresa May has been granted a little breathing space. The EU has allowed a few more days to try to get her deal through the House of Commons. But it's not the timetable that she chose. And as things stand, the expectation that the compromise deal will get through is low. And, more to the point, the government does not believe that it can hold off another attempt by a powerful cross-party group of MPs who are resolved to put Parliament forcibly in charge of the process to find alternatives. Ministers are therefore today not just wondering about how to manage one last heave for the prime minister's deal, but what they should do next, when - odds on - the whole issue is in the hands of the Commons, not Number 10. Read Laura's blog Senior Labour MP Hilary Benn has also said that he will table an amendment on Monday, enabling MPs to hold a series of ""indicative votes"" on Wednesday on alternatives to Mrs May's plan. He said these could include a free trade agreement, a customs union and a referendum. He told the BBC the EU's decision was ""a case of crisis delayed, not crisis ended"" as it still looked unlikely that Mrs May's deal would be approved. ""We cannot have a no-deal Brexit in three weeks' time,"" he said. The government is also exploring with opposition parties the idea of holding ""indicative"" votes on alternatives to its own Brexit policy, in an effort to retain some control over the process. Plaid Cymru's leader at Westminster, Liz Saville Roberts, who has been taking part in the talks, said: ""The government is now openly exploring a process to allow Parliament to take control - an effective admission that they have lost all authority. ""We will be continuing to push for a People's Vote as a way out of this Brexit mess."" This video can not be played Greg Clark: May's MPs speech 'not a great success' At a news conference on Thursday night, Mrs May also struck a conciliatory tone when she referred toher speech from Downing Street the previous evening, which had sparked an angry reaction from MPs after she blamed them for the Brexit deadlock. ""Last night I expressed my frustration and I know that MPs are frustrated too,"" she said. ""They have difficult jobs to do."" Speaking to Nick Robinson's Political Thinking podcast, Business Secretary Greg Clark said that speech ""clearly wasn't a great success"". ""I don't think it was helpful in resolving the matter. But, listen, none of us is infallible and even prime ministers sometimes don't get the tone quite right,"" he said. It comes after a petition calling for Article 50 to be revokedpassed three million signatures. A march demanding another referendum is also planned for Saturday in central London. In her briefing to journalists, Mrs May dismissed calls to revoke Article 50 - the process by which the UK leaves the EU - which would mean Brexit is cancelled. Mrs May said people had voted to leave and were told their decision would be respected.

"The life stories of the Christchurch mosque victims are a striking reflection of a world in turmoil - one marked by war, poverty and economic inequality. In New Zealand, many thought they had found a safe, remote corner of Earth on which to build new lives. That changed last Friday at 13:40 when a gunman casually opened fire. ""I was so happy that I had a beautiful country to raise my kids in,"" says Mazharuddin Syed Ahmed, a survivor of those attacks. ""This really hurts me."" In the week since 50 lives were abruptly taken, Christchurch has come together with powerful messages of unity. For many here, this has opened their eyes to a diverse and complex community they previously gave little attention. But it is also a reminder of how easy it is for hatred to proliferate and then explode - and a closer look at the stories of those who attended the mosques last Friday is also a stark portrait of just how fragile their worlds had always been. Khaled Mustafa, 44, and his son Hamza, 16, were refugees. They had escaped the war in Syria along with three other family members. The family had spent time in Jordan at first, before they were accepted under New Zealand's refugee resettlement programme. They naturally assumed New Zealand was a safe place and had been there for less than a year when they were killed at the Al Noor mosque on Deans Avenue, the site of the first of the two attacks. Abo Ali, a Syrian man who moved to New Zealand in 1990, says he met the family just once but they were ""so happy to have a better life"". ""They run away from the death, and they die here,"" Mr Ali tells the BBC. Hamza's younger brother, Zaid, was also at the mosque. He survived, but was injured. He attended the funeral of his father and brother on Wednesday in a wheelchair, after surgery. ""I shouldn't be standing in front of you. I should be lying beside you,"" he was reportedly heard muttering at their graveside. Abo Ali says the support of New Zealanders has helped the community through the past week Mr Ali says the news hit the local Syrian and Muslim communities hard. ""But after, when we see the New Zealand people's support, and when we see the Christian people in New Zealand too, their support - believe me, we forget about our problem."" In many ways, 24-year-old Ansi Alibava's path to New Zealand was an unlikely one. She was born in Kerala, India, and not into a wealthy family. After her father died in Saudi Arabia, where he had been working, she began looking after the family, aged just 18. Her husband Abdul Nazer says that when they first met, he was struck by how she was ""supporting everything"". The couple had migrated from India a year ago to pursue her dream of studying and travelling overseas. It had been his dream to make hers a reality, he said. It was only when his father agreed to pledge his house for a loan that the pair were able to get to New Zealand. It was the first time either had even been outside of Kerala. After securing jobs in Christchurch they had been supporting both families at home. Mr Nazer can only manage a few words as he describes the bliss they shared in New Zealand. She loved her studies, he says, sitting in a room at Christchurch's Lincoln University where she was working towards a masters degree in agricultural engineering. She had recently begun an internship. He had just been telling his cousin Fahad Ismail Ponnath, who was there to support him, how the campus brought back so many ""lovely memories"" - rooms they had been in together, places they had walked. But last Friday the couple went to the Al Noor mosque as usual, going their own ways into the male and female areas. Abdul Nazer (left) said his wife had room in her heart for all people When the gunfire erupted, Mr Nazer fled the building and leapt over a fence into a nearby property. The owner of that house initially didn't let him in ""thinking that he was one of the terrorists maybe,"" Mr Ponnath says. But he soon left the safety of that house to look for his wife, and he found her lying motionless on a street. As he moved towards her, calling out, other survivors intervened to tell him she had died. Soon the police were there, moving everyone, including her husband, away. In limited English, Mr Nazer, 34, says of his wife: ""She's a really lovely person. Very kindly."" ""She loved all people,"" he says. ""Cousins, friends. She kept a big space in her mind [for] family members. Especially my father and my mother, my brothers."" Mr Nazer doesn't know for sure whether he'll remain in New Zealand, but it is likely, as he is now committed to supporting Ms Alibava's family - they have no breadwinners left. On Wednesday, flowers and tributes were starting to pile up outside Mohammed Imran Khan's takeaway shop, Indian Grill. Mr Khan, also known among friends as Imran Bhai, died in the Linwood mosque. Originally from India, he was an immensely popular figure in Christchurch. ""It's just been an absolutely overwhelming [amount] of texts and messages or communications from people I don't even know - just saying what a lovely man he was,"" his wife Tracey says. ""I knew that people loved him, not so much to this extent, I think. He was a very known man throughout the community for just his heart and giving of time and everything else."" Who were the victims of the mosque shootings? She is focused on looking after their teenage son, as well as her husband's relatives. ""It's very difficult being over the other side of the world and hearing this, and not having information,"" she says, with relatives arriving from around the world. Having spent much of his life in his native India and then Saudi Arabia, Mazharuddin Syed Ahmed says he ""couldn't comprehend"" how safe and inclusive New Zealand was when he arrived. This video can not be played Mazharuddin Syed Ahmed: ""We were all praying... and I heard gunshots"" He used to tell his friends overseas: ""You're scared to death to go to airports. Here, we love the airport. It's like fun - we enjoy it, it's like a pleasure trip for us. Because this country's safe."" Mr Syed Ahmed says the Linwood mosque was home to a small and close community. ""We really love to go on Friday and we were praying,"" he says, emphasising the final word. He cannot believe what happened to him and his friends in the country he regards as the greatest on Earth. Mr Syed Ahmed says he froze when he heard three gunshots interrupting Friday prayers. Abdul Aziz has been hailed a hero for taking on the gunman at the Linwood mosque People continued briefly to pray but his ears ""were completely focused - there is something happening"". Then, he says, one man started yelling: ""Take cover, take cover - move, move, move."" Despite hearing shots, he ran straight towards the main door - he doesn't know why - and took cover in a storage space next to door when the gunman came in. He believes he was saved by another worshipper, Abdul Aziz, who took on the attacker by hurling a credit card machine at him. ""But that time, I saw my friend right in my line of sight,"" Mr Syed Ahmed says. ""[A] big splash of blood was on the wall - I could see that he had died there."" The dozens of victims largely began their lives outside New Zealand, in South Asia and the Middle East, in Somalia or Fiji, Malaysia and Indonesia. Linda Armstrong's family say her last act was saving a friend in the mosque Linda Armstrong, 64, was a New Zealander but her life had been far from conventional, her nephew Kyron Gosse says. At one point, as ""a bit of a hippy"", she had lived on Waiheke Island near her home city of Auckland ""in this little hut in the middle of the bush with only a long drop [toilet] and no shower"", he says. At other times, she had settled in lofts and granny flats, ridden a motorbike, and travelled extensively - once living in Berlin. Always curious, she found Islam in 2011 while volunteering in a refugee centre in Auckland and talking to people there. ""She'd want to know - why? What do you believe?"" Mr Gosse says. ""And as she found out more and more about Islam, she told me: 'These are really beautiful people and this religion really resonates with me'."" He describes his aunt as ""a kind of outrageous character"" who had always been rebellious and a bit stubborn. She brought her stubbornness to the mosque. Following one conversation with a younger relative, she took issue with the plastic waste being generated there - so she went out and bought everyone reusable plates. She rarely had much money but was endlessly generous. Despite living on welfare payments, she began donating NZ$50 (Â£25; $34) per month to a refugee family from Syria. ""She never met them, she just heard about it and thought: what can I do?"" Mr Gosse says. Ms Armstrong ""wasn't in the best of health"", so she was seated at the back of the mosque when the violence came. That didn't stop her moving quickly to protect others. ""She put herself in front of one of her friends, took the bullet, and then died in her arms with the imam saying a prayer over her,"" Mr Gosse tells the BBC. ""We're all pretty proud that that was the sort of person she was."" Across Christchurch this week, locals have been comparing the collective trauma to an earthquake that struck the city in 2011, killing 185 people. It is, many say, a similar pain although they are fully aware that this particular pain has been inflicted by a person, and on a specific community. After an earthquake, a city can rebuild - a physical healing of its wounds. One victim, Zakaria Bhuiya was part of that process. He had moved to Christchurch from Bangladesh to work on the post-quake rebuild, according to the Indian Social and Cultural Club. Mr Bhuiya, a welder, had taken annual leave on Friday to celebrate his 33rd birthday with friends at the Al Noor mosque. ""He lived on the bare basics in order to maximise the money he could send home to support his family,"" his employer AMT Mechanical said. He leaves behind a wife in Bangladesh, Rina Akter. He had no family in Christchurch, but in the days it took officials to identify his body, the friends he had made staged a small protest outside the mosque. ""Our brother is missing, give us some information,"" read one sign. At times in this city of about 400,000 people it feels like everyone knew a victim, or knows someone who did. Peter Higgins, 67, says cardiologist Amjad Hamid had convinced him to retire following ""a heart attack"" and subsequent complications. Peter Higgins says Amjad Hamid had saved many people during his life ""That bloke really turned my life around,"" he says of Dr Hamid, a 57-year-old Palestinian who migrated decades ago. ""He got shot. And I think, how many people has he saved? And someone decides to play out with a gun."" The tragedy has made many think more deeply about the Muslim community here. Clare Needham, 72, says Daoud Nabi - the first of the dead to be identified - would turn up frequently to a charity shop where she volunteered, and would haggle over items. Daoud Nabi was the first of the victims to be formally named Mr Nabi, 70, told her of his deep love for his grandson. It was only this week that she learned the kind of profile he had within the community. Born in Afghanistan but a long-time New Zealand resident, he was president of a local Afghan association and a known supporter of other migrant groups. This video can not be played Farid Ahmed: ""I have forgiven him and I will pray for him"" One visitor to the tributes, Dave Palmer, was struck by the tolerance of Farid Ahmed, whose wife was killed in the attack, yet who told reporters he had forgiven the shooter. ""I thought: I don't know whether I could ever do that,"" says Mr Palmer, a Christian. ""That takes an amazing amount of strength and courage."" The kind of tolerance personified by Farid Ahmed and Linda Armstrong stands in stark contrast to the gunman and the online communities through which material allegedly posted by him spread. Australian Brenton Tarrant, 28, a self-described white supremacist, has been charged with murder. The gunman live-streamed the massacre on Facebook and a person suspected to be him posted a 65,000-word document online, outlining the alleged reasons for the attacks. As many have pointed out since, it was littered with coded references that sought to engage specific online communities. It was posted on 8chan - a forum favoured by the alt-right. It showed just how easy it is for intolerance and hate to ignite in such forums, unlike in the wider community, where tolerance is patiently built up over time. Ultimately, it took just one man and 17 minutes - in the case of the Al Noor attack - to shatter dozens of carefully built, second-chance lives. This video can not be played A comic is asking searching questions about race relations in the wake of the attack Questions have been raised since the attacks about whether forums should be better monitored for evidence of extremism, but experts say this would be challenging for a few reasons - not least the sheer volume of posts. ""We told them our fears about the rise of the alt-right. And the government has not responded adequately,"" says Anjum Rahman, of the Islamic Women's Council of New Zealand, who says she has been pleading with successive governments to address discrimination. Ms Rahman is also sharply critical of the media. ""Where were you?"" she says, arguing there was not enough scrutiny globally. Australia soul-searches after Christchurch Ardern calls for global anti-racism fight How prevalent is far-right extremism? Paul Hunt, New Zealand's chief human rights commissioner, says it has one of the world's best human rights records although it does see Islamophobia, racism and hate crimes in ""some sectors of society"". But if the gunman -whose name Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has sworn she will never speak- had wanted to tear New Zealand apart, judging from the past week he has failed. On Thursday,the prime minister announced a wide-ranging crackdown on New Zealand's gun laws- including banning all the types of weapons used in the attacks. Ardern: 'A leader with love on full display' How mass killings have changed gun laws What are New Zealand's gun laws? Unlike after attacks in the US, for example, it's been almost universally well-received - some people had begun turning in their guns before the ban was even announced. The past week has seen a constant stream of tributes from New Zealanders of all ages and backgrounds Again and again, locals say they are determined to pull together and ensure this tragedy is not repeated. ""I'm trying to process grief but also anger: how dare he do this to us?"" says Cara Butler, 38. ""But I think he's picked the wrong place - I think he's going to see the opposite of what he thought. He's not going to create division, it's going to create community and more cohesion."" Mr Syed Ahmed, the survivor, says his two children ""have New Zealand, Kiwi values - and I'm so happy with that"". But he fears for them, saying all nations - not just New Zealand - must not become complacent. ""Now I see that people can come to the remotest, peaceful corner of Earth,"" he says. ""This just can't happen to this country. You can't leave it just as another incident. We're [travelling] as far as the Moon and Mars, but our neighbourhoods aren't safe for our kids? ""It's everyone's responsibility to deal with this hate."" . Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Positive,1.0

After an earthquake, a city can rebuild - a physical healing of its wounds. One victim, Zakaria Bhuiya was part of that process. He had moved to Christchurch from Bangladesh to work on the post-quake rebuild, according to the Indian Social and Cultural Club. Mr Bhuiya, a welder, had taken annual leave on Friday to celebrate his 33rd birthday with friends at the Al Noor mosque. ""He lived on the bare basics in order to maximise the money he could send home to support his family,"" his employer AMT Mechanical said. He leaves behind a wife in Bangladesh, Rina Akter. He had no family in Christchurch, but in the days it took officials to identify his body, the friends he had made staged a small protest outside the mosque. ""Our brother is missing, give us some information,"" read one sign. At times in this city of about 400,000 people it feels like everyone knew a victim, or knows someone who did. Peter Higgins, 67, says cardiologist Amjad Hamid had convinced him to retire following ""a heart attack"" and subsequent complications. Peter Higgins says Amjad Hamid had saved many people during his life ""That bloke really turned my life around,"" he says of Dr Hamid, a 57-year-old Palestinian who migrated decades ago. ""He got shot. And I think, how many people has he saved? And someone decides to play out with a gun."" The tragedy has made many think more deeply about the Muslim community here. Clare Needham, 72, says Daoud Nabi - the first of the dead to be identified - would turn up frequently to a charity shop where she volunteered, and would haggle over items. Daoud Nabi was the first of the victims to be formally named Mr Nabi, 70, told her of his deep love for his grandson. It was only this week that she learned the kind of profile he had within the community. Born in Afghanistan but a long-time New Zealand resident, he was president of a local Afghan association and a known supporter of other migrant groups. This video can not be played Farid Ahmed: ""I have forgiven him and I will pray for him"" One visitor to the tributes, Dave Palmer, was struck by the tolerance of Farid Ahmed, whose wife was killed in the attack, yet who told reporters he had forgiven the shooter. ""I thought: I don't know whether I could ever do that,"" says Mr Palmer, a Christian. ""That takes an amazing amount of strength and courage."" The kind of tolerance personified by Farid Ahmed and Linda Armstrong stands in stark contrast to the gunman and the online communities through which material allegedly posted by him spread. Australian Brenton Tarrant, 28, a self-described white supremacist, has been charged with murder. The gunman live-streamed the massacre on Facebook and a person suspected to be him posted a 65,000-word document online, outlining the alleged reasons for the attacks. As many have pointed out since, it was littered with coded references that sought to engage specific online communities. It was posted on 8chan - a forum favoured by the alt-right. It showed just how easy it is for intolerance and hate to ignite in such forums, unlike in the wider community, where tolerance is patiently built up over time. Ultimately, it took just one man and 17 minutes - in the case of the Al Noor attack - to shatter dozens of carefully built, second-chance lives. This video can not be played A comic is asking searching questions about race relations in the wake of the attack Questions have been raised since the attacks about whether forums should be better monitored for evidence of extremism, but experts say this would be challenging for a few reasons - not least the sheer volume of posts. ""We told them our fears about the rise of the alt-right. And the government has not responded adequately,"" says Anjum Rahman, of the Islamic Women's Council of New Zealand, who says she has been pleading with successive governments to address discrimination. Ms Rahman is also sharply critical of the media. ""Where were you?"" she says, arguing there was not enough scrutiny globally. Australia soul-searches after Christchurch Ardern calls for global anti-racism fight How prevalent is far-right extremism? Paul Hunt, New Zealand's chief human rights commissioner, says it has one of the world's best human rights records although it does see Islamophobia, racism and hate crimes in ""some sectors of society"". But if the gunman -whose name Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has sworn she will never speak- had wanted to tear New Zealand apart, judging from the past week he has failed. On Thursday,the prime minister announced a wide-ranging crackdown on New Zealand's gun laws- including banning all the types of weapons used in the attacks. Ardern: 'A leader with love on full display' How mass killings have changed gun laws What are New Zealand's gun laws? Unlike after attacks in the US, for example, it's been almost universally well-received - some people had begun turning in their guns before the ban was even announced. The past week has seen a constant stream of tributes from New Zealanders of all ages and backgrounds Again and again, locals say they are determined to pull together and ensure this tragedy is not repeated. ""I'm trying to process grief but also anger: how dare he do this to us?"" says Cara Butler, 38. ""But I think he's picked the wrong place - I think he's going to see the opposite of what he thought. He's not going to create division, it's going to create community and more cohesion."" Mr Syed Ahmed, the survivor, says his two children ""have New Zealand, Kiwi values - and I'm so happy with that"". But he fears for them, saying all nations - not just New Zealand - must not become complacent. ""Now I see that people can come to the remotest, peaceful corner of Earth,"" he says. ""This just can't happen to this country. You can't leave it just as another incident. We're [travelling] as far as the Moon and Mars, but our neighbourhoods aren't safe for our kids? ""It's everyone's responsibility to deal with this hate."" . Â© 2025 BBC.

"Abdelbaset al-Megrahi is the only person to have been convicted of the 1988 bombing Five former members of the Stasi, the intelligence service in communist East Germany, have been questioned over the Lockerbie bombing. A German state prosecutor has confirmed the five were spoken to at the request of authorities in Scotland. It is part of the ongoing criminal inquiry into the atrocity 30 years ago. According to reports in Germany, the individuals were in their 70s and 80s, and were interviewed as witnesses, not suspects, over the last nine months. ""These are solely witness interrogations,"" a spokeswoman for the prosecutor's office in Frankfurt an der Oder, on the Polish border was quoted as saying by Germany's dpa news agency. Pan Am flight 103 was brought down by a bomb over southern Scotland on 21 December, 1988. All 259 passengers and crew were killed, along with 11 residents of the town of Lockerbie. In 2001, a Scottish court sitting in the Netherlands ruled that the bombing had been carried out by Abdelbaset al Megrahi, a member of the Libyan intelligence service. Megrahi continued to protest his innocence until his death in Libya in 2012. Megrahi was jailed for life but released on compassionate grounds in 2009 when he had terminal cancer, and died three years later in Tripoli. Prosecutors at Scotland's Crown Office have always said that Megrahi did not act alone and was one of a number of Libyans involved in bombing the plane. The prosecution case was that the bomb was placed in an unaccompanied suitcase and smuggled onto a plane from Malta to Frankfurt, where it was loaded onto a feeder flight to Heathrow and then into the hold of Pan Am 103. In 2015, the Crown Office asked the Libyan authorities for permission to interview two unnamed men who were in custody following the revolution which toppled Colonel Gaddafi's regime. Prosecutors said there was a ""proper basis in law"" to treat the men as suspects. The men were Abdullah Senussi, Gaddafi's brother in law and former intelligence chief and Mohammed Abuagila Masud. Senussi had been sentenced to death by a Libyan court that year but is still alive and in custody. Masud was sentenced by the same court to 10 years in prison for bomb-making. The prosecution at the Lockerbie trial alleged that Masud had been with Megrahi on the day the bomb brought down Pan Am 103. Former Stasi agents gave evidence during the trial about the agency's involvement with a Swiss businessman who was said to have made the timer which triggered the Lockerbie bomb. The Stasi also featured in a documentary broadcast in 2015. It was made by American filmmaker Ken Dornstein, whose brother was on board Pan Am 103. Eleven people in Lockerbie died along with 259 passengers and crew from the plane The programme claimed that the Stasi had carried out surveillance on Libyan agents who bombed a disco in West Berlin in 1986. Three people were killed, including two American servicemen.   The documentary said the Stasi had information that Masud was in West Berlin when the disco was attacked. Lockerbie: The town scarred by terror Farmer's tribute to Lockerbie victims Finding words to describe Lockerbie On the 30th anniversary of the bombing last December, the Crown Office said the ongoing criminal inquiry had uncovered ""intelligence and information supportive of the original trial court's finding that the bombing was Libyan state-sponsored terrorism in which Abdelbaset al-Megrahi was a key player"". The Crown said its investigations were also contributing evidence in relation to other individuals ""involved in the conspiracy to commit the atrocity"". Asked about the questioning of the former Stasi agents, the Crown Office said: ""Prosecutors and police, working with UK government and US colleagues, will continue this investigation with the sole aim of bringing those who acted along with al Megrahi to justice. As this is a live criminal investigation, it would not be appropriate to comment."" Megrahi always protested his innocence. The Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission is currently carrying out its own inquiry to decide whether his case should be referred back to the appeal court.

"This video can not be played Imam Gamal Fouda, who was leading prayers, thanked the people of New Zealand ""for their tears"" New Zealand has broadcast the Islamic call to prayer and observed a two-minute silence in ceremonies to mark a week since the Christchurch attacks. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern joined thousands of mourners near the Al-Noor mosque, one of two places of worship targeted in last Friday's shootings. Imam Gamal Fouda, who led the prayers, said: ""We are broken-hearted, but we are not broken."" Fifty people were killed and dozens more wounded in the attacks. The lives lost and the world they revealed Australian Brenton Tarrant, a self-proclaimed white supremacist, has been charged with one murder and is expected to face further charges. On Thursday Ms Ardern announced a ban on all types of semi-automatic weapons. This video can not be played The victims have been remembered at events throughout the week Thousands of people have gathered in Hagley Park, near the Al-Noor mosque, to mark Friday's national day of reflection for the victims. The Muslim call to prayer, or adhan, was broadcast on national television and radio at 13:30 (00:30 GMT) and was followed by a two-minute silence. In an address beforehand, Ms Ardern said: ""New Zealand mourns with you, we are one."" ""According to the Prophet Muhammad... the believers in their mutual kindness, compassion and sympathy are just like one body. When any part of the body suffers, the whole body feels pain."" The child, the father, the aspiring footballer Video: 'The attacker killed my whole family' UK survivor 'cradled young woman' killed at mosque The Imam of Al-Noor mosque, Gamal Fouda, was there when the attack happened and said the gunman ""broke the hearts of millions around the world"". ""Today, from the same place, I look out and I see the love and compassion,"" he said. ""We are alive, we are together, we are determined to not let anyone divide us."" One observer, John Clark, said the message was profound: ""People will be rethinking how they react, how they think, and how they speak sometimes - it's penetrated to that level of society. ""We like to think that we're a liberal community, but we know that there are dark parts,"" said Mr Clark, 72. ""It will positively affect New Zealand and maybe we'll have even more to offer the world."" Imam Gamal Fouda delivered a sermon Many mosques across the country are opening their doors to visitors, and human chains will be formed outside some in symbolic acts of protection and support. A mass funeral is being held for 30 of the dead, including the youngest victim Mucaad Ibrahim, aged three , who was killed at the Al-Noor mosque. Howard Johnson, BBC News, Hagley Park, Christchurch ""I'm wearing this in solidarity today,"" said hairdresser Melody, pointing at a blue headscarf adorned with gold crucifixes. Like thousands of others in the city of Christchurch, she's been struggling to come to terms with the horror of last week's attacks. All week advertising hoardings have been beaming positive messages back onto the streets: ""This isn't us"", ""Kia Kaha Christchurch"" and ""No room for racism here"". Friday was a chance for Christchurchers to bring those sentiments together in one place at the same time and to pay their respects to the dead. People flocked from all corners of the city and flowers and messages of sympathy were laid at the foot of the park's towering oak trees. A Maori biker gang gathered in the enclosure for Muslim prayers to offer their protection. One had a large red crucifix emblazoned on the back of his leather waistcoat. It felt symbolic of New Zealand's positive, multicultural response to the killings. When the tributes were over people started pouring out of the park, back into the city and their everyday lives. I approached Christine McCartney. She was born in the city in 1951 and has lived here her whole life. ""It's all been deeply saddening,"" she told me, ""but I feel positive about the way this has brought us all together."" This video can not be played Robin Molony: ""In solidarity with the Muslim women, we are wearing our headscarves"" Earlier, Ms Ardern encouraged as many New Zealanders as possible to use the day to pause and reflect. ""I know many New Zealanders wish to mark the week that has passed since the terrorist attack and to support the Muslim community as they return to mosques,"" she said. ""How we choose to reflect during the silence will be different for each of us. Everyone should do what feels right for them, wherever they are - at home, at work, at school."" One social media campaign has urged non-Muslim women in New Zealand to wear a headscarf for the day. Meanwhile, government officials worked into the night to prepare the mosque and the bodies of victims for a mass burial in Christchurch later on Friday. One person who took part said: ""All the bodies are washed. We finished around 1.30am. It was our duty. After we finished, there was a lot of emotion. People were crying and hugging."" Ms Ardern announced a ban on all types of semi-automatic weapons and assault rifles following the Christchurch attacks. She said she expected new legislation to be in place by 11 April, saying: ""Our history changed forever. Now, our laws will too."" Victim named in NZ murder charge is alive How mass shootings have changed gun laws What are New Zealand's gun laws? This video can not be played New Zealand's PM said she hoped the ban would be in place by 11 April ""Six days after this attack, we are announcing a ban on all military style semi-automatics (MSSA) and assault rifles in New Zealand,"" Ms Ardern said in a news conference. ""Related parts used to convert these guns into MSSAs are also being banned, along with all high-capacity magazines."" An amnesty has been imposed so the owners of affected weapons can hand them in, and a buy-back scheme will follow. The buy-back could cost up to NZ$200m ($138m; Â£104m), but Ms Ardern said ""that is the price that we must pay to ensure the safety of our communities"". Ms Ardern has also announced that a National Memorial Service for victims is being planned for next week.

May 'hopes' UK will leave EU with a deal How could Brexit be delayed? Brexit: What could happen next? It is not the most popular ever on the Parliament website. A petition for a second EU referendum in June 2016 attracted more than four million signatures and was debated in the Commons - but thousands of signatures were removed after it wasdiscovered to have been hijacked by automated bots. People signing petitions on the Parliament website are asked to tick a box saying they are a British citizen or UK resident and to confirm their name, email address, and postcode to sign. Data from the petitions website on Thursday evening suggested 1.3m signatures were from people who said they were from the UK, 10,000 from France, nearly 6,000 from Spain and more than 4,000 from Germany, among others. A Commons spokesman said signature patterns are investigated to check for fraudulent activity and suspect signatures are removed, including those that are ""clearly bots"". He added: ""Anyone who is a UK resident or a British citizen can sign a petition. This includes British citizens living overseas."" By BBC political reporter Brian Wheeler Petitions on the Parliament website rarely lead to a change in the law. They are not even guaranteed to lead to a debate in Parliament - they only get considered for debate if they reach 100,000 signatures. The petitions committee rejects them if it believes the UK government can't do anything about the issue. But what petitions can do is put an issue on the political radar - and that is what appears to have happened with the petition to revoke Article 50. It was previously something of a taboo subject at Westminster. Even the most ardent anti-Brexiteers know it would be political suicide for any prime minister to overturn a referendum result without going back to the people. But some Remainer MPs are now calling on social media for the government to do just that. Earlier Commons leader Andrea Leadsom dismissed the petition as not being on the same scale as the pro-Brexit vote in the 2016 referendum. ""Should it reach 17.4 million respondents then I am sure there will be a very clear case for taking action,"" she told MPs. She added: ""It's absolutely right that people do have the opportunity to put their views and that can then spark yet another Brexit debate."" In December, the European Court of Justice ruled that the UK can unilaterally revoke Article 50 of the Treaty of the European Union. This means the UK can decide to stay in the EU without the consent of the 27 other member states. Few MPs have mentioned this as a potential option so far. Please upgrade your browser Use the list below or select a button The petition has long since passed the 100,000 signatures that means it will be considered for debate. Margaret Anne Georgiadou, who started the petition, told the BBC: ""I became like every other Remainer - very frustrated that we've been silenced and ignored for so long. ""So I think now it's almost like a dam bursting, because we've been held back in a sense - it's almost like last chance saloon now."" She said the petition ""didn't do very well for a week"". ""I nearly gave up but then I contacted a lot of people and it took off,"" she added. In January, MPsdebated whether the UK should leave the EU without a deal,after a petition calling for that got 371,673 signatures. MPs have been sharing the revoke Article 50 petition on social media, including Lib Dem Brexit spokesman Tom Brake, who said Mrs May's ""cliff-edge ultimatum"" had led ""hundreds of thousands"" to sign.

Pete Wishart, who was among a number of SNP MPs who shared the petition, called on the public to sign and ""end the madness"". And Labour MP Neil Coyle urged the public to sign. But Conservative MP Andrew Bowie said the only way to rule out a no-deal Brexit ""at all"" was to back the prime minister's deal. A House of Commons spokesperson said the site crashed on Thursday morning because of ""a large and sustained load on the system"". The petition reads: ""The government repeatedly claims exiting the EU is 'the will of the people'. ""We need to put a stop to this claim by proving the strength of public support now, for remaining in the EU. A People's Vote may not happen - so vote now."" The government will have a third try at getting MPs to back Theresa May's EU withdrawal deal in a Commons vote next week, but only if it thinks it has enough support to win. At the same time, a cross-party group of MPs will try to give Parliament control of Brexit by allowing a series of ""indicative"" votes on alternatives to the PM's deal. Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt insisted MPs only had a ""limited"" range of options ""if we are in the same situation this time next week"". He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""Parliament could vote to revoke Article 50, which is cancelling the Brexit process. I think that's highly unlikely."" He said the other, more likely, options were leaving without a deal, or having a longer extension granted at an emergency EU summit, but with ""onerous conditions"". ""The choice that we have now is one of resolving this issue or extreme unpredictability,"" he said. What happens now that a deal's been done? How does another Brexit delay work?

"MPs have been urged to take taxis home from Parliament and not travel alone in the coming days, over security fears. Deputy Speaker Lindsay Hoyle has written to all MPs ahead of potentially crunch Brexit votes next week. ""I have never felt this level of tension during my time in the House and I am aware other colleagues feel the same,"" wrote Mr Hoyle. He said regional police forces have been told to be aware of tensions both at Westminster and locally. He added that the Metropolitan Police has been told it must take a lead to ensure MPs can vote without fear. Special provisions to allow MPs to be collected from the Parliamentary estate by taxi have been introduced. MPs have also been advised to travel with colleagues, rather than on their own.

"This video can not be played Theresa May: ""I hope we can all agree we are now at the moment of decision"" EU leaders have agreed on a plan to delay the Article 50 process, postponing Brexit beyond 29 March. The UK will be offered a delay until 22 May, if MPs approve the withdrawal deal negotiated with the EU next week. If they do not, the EU will back a shorter delay until 12 April, allowing the UK time to get the deal through or to ""indicate a way forward"". Mrs May said there was now a ""clear choice"" facing UK MPs, who could vote for a third time on her deal next week. They could back the withdrawal deal, deliver on the referendum and leave the EU in ""an orderly manner"" or face the prospect of having to stand candidates in the European Parliamentary elections, three years after the UK voted to leave the EU. She said she would be ""working hard to build support for getting the deal through"". She said she had ""expressed frustration"" in her speech last night, in which she blamed MPs for the delay, but added ""I know that MPs are frustrated too"" and she was ""very grateful"" to those who had supported the deal. ""I will make every effort to make sure we can leave with a deal and move our country forward,"" she said.

In a press conference with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, European Council President Donald Tusk said that, until 12 April - by when the UK would have to indicate whether it would stand candidates in the 2019 European Parliament elections - ""all options remain on the table ... the UK government will still have a chance of a deal, no deal, a long extension or revoking Article 50"". If the UK has not decided by 12 April whether to take part in the elections the ""option of a long extension will automatically become impossible"", he said. He added that the atmosphere was ""much better than I had expected"" among EU leaders in discussions and he was now ""much more optimistic"". Mr Juncker said the European Commission had ""worked tirelessly"" to negotiate the withdrawal deal and respond to requests from the UK for further reassurances about keeping the Northern Irish border open.Legally-binding assurances agreed in Strasbourg last weekhad been endorsed, he added. ""This closes and completes the full package. There is no more that we can have."" Discussions ran late into the evening on Thursday amid reports of disagreement between the 27 other EU leaders about the details. They are understood to have discussed potential dates of 7 May or a longer delay until the end of the year. What will EU leaders do if UK MPs reject the deal for a third time? By Reality Check's Chris Morris It's been clear for some time that EU leaders were prepared to offer a short extension of the Article 50 process. But there have been different views about how long ""short"" should be. Now we know. If the UK doesn't take part in European elections, a strict interpretation of the law rules out an extension until the end of June, which is what the Prime Minister had initially requested. That's why the 27 EU leaders offered a possible extension until 22 May, the day before voting in the elections begins. Such an extension is only on offer, though, if UK MPs vote for the Brexit deal in the House of Commons next week. And EU leaders know the numbers there don't look good for the government. So their second offer is a much shorter extension until 12 April, by which time the UK would have to legislate for holding elections in May. The government has insisted that it has no intention of taking part in the elections. But the language used by the EU keeps the possibility of UK participation open. That means that a much longer extension has not been ruled out, even though that too is an idea that has been rejected by Theresa May in the past. So the legal and political calculations that surround the EU's offer are complex, and the outcome is difficult to predict. But one thing is clear - barring dramatic developments, it confirms that the UK will not be leaving the EU on 29 March as originally intended.
