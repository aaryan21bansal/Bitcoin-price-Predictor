"Major problems have been reported with Scotland's Covid vaccine passport app, just hours after its launch. People now need proof they have had two doses of vaccine in order to enter nightclubs and many other large events. The NHS Scotland Covid Status app only became available to download onApple,externalandAndroid,externaldevices at about 17:30 on Thursday. But many people have said they were unable to access their vaccination status through the app. The Scottish government said more than 70,000 people had downloaded the app on on Thursday, with a spokesman adding: ""This huge demand did mean that some people experienced delays and we are sorry that happened. ""We have now increased the capacity of the NHS systems that sit behind the app - where most of the issues causing delays have occurred - in order to deal with demand and, as a result, we are seeing increasing numbers of people now able to access their records."" What do we know about Scotland's vaccine passport? Judge refuses to delay vaccine passport scheme Public 'not ready' for vaccine passport scheme Anecdotal evidence on social media suggested that problems may have arisen when people tried to use their NHS CHI number to register. This step comes after users are asked to take a picture of their passport or driving licence. Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said there should be an ""indefinite delay"" to the rollout of the new scheme to avoid a ""weekend of chaos"" at venues across the country. He added: ""Thousands of people will be at the football and going out to hospitality premises this weekend. ""This plan should really be scrapped altogether but, if the SNP insist on charging ahead, they must indefinitely delay the vaccine passport scheme until the most basic issues are ironed out."" Many people reported problems registering with the scheme on Friday People have been sharing their experiences of trying to download the new vaccine passport app. Dean of the Faculty of Advocates, Roddy Dunlop QC, described the app as the ""worst I have ever tried to use"". He wrote on Twitter: ""I am not prone to hyperbole. I promise. ""And I instantly recognise that I was originally instructed to challenge the introduction of Covid passports and so am not neutral. ""But try the app. This is, literally, the worst app I have ever tried to use."" Another app usershared screenshots,externalof his experience on Twitter during which he was told ""no match found"" followed by: ""Something went wrong. We're working on it."" Others reported issues getting past the initial log in page, while aBBC Good Morning Scotlandlistener told the programme that he had tried twice to download the app without success. He said: ""I tried for a couple of hours last night but not joy and this morning I tried again and although I could get past the biometric part it would take me to end of the process and was still not working. ""It just isn't suitable for purpose at the moment, they should have known it was going to happen in the first place."" University of Edinburgh scientist Dr Christine Tait-Burkard said she was unable to get the app working, being told a match could not be found for her on the NHS database. However, the academic told the programme that once up and running, the app will help ""persuade some of the hesitant people [to get vaccinated] if the vaccine passport has consequences."" Mike Rhodes, of the IT firm ConsultMyApp, said he thought the servers being used for the app were being overloaded because of demand but this should have been anticipated. He said: ""It is highly likely that those developers that built the app shell also built the interface to the back-end servers that ended up failing. ""Secondly, this wasn't an unforeseen event - the developers absolutely knew this would be downloaded incredibly quickly and was likely to get hundreds of thousands of people attempting to register at the same time."" Mr Rhodes questioned why there was ""so little time"" between the app being launched and it being needed for entry into events. The new rules came into effect at 05:00 on Friday - but the government announced earlier this week that they will not actually be enforced until 18 October. Paul Banham, of Glasgow's Buff Club, toldBBC Scotland's Lunchtime Live: ""We'll be having a look at them over the next few weeks but we won't be refusing entry if someone doesn't have it - there's too many glitches at the moment. ""We've had a lot of students contact us and a lot of them are saying they have been vaccinated in other areas of the UK and that is not showing on their Covid status so there's a few gaps at the moment and hopefully they will be ironed out."" The Night Time Industries Association (NTIA), which represents nightclub, lost a legal bid to delay the rollout on Thursday. It had argued that the new system was ""discriminatory"" and ""disproportionate"". But judge Lord Burns ruled that the vaccine passports were ""an attempt to address the legitimate issues identified in a balanced way"", and was within the margin of what the government could decide was a reasonable response to the pandemic. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the court judgement was ""clear and emphatic"". She said: ""This is a targeted and proportionate way to try and reduce the harm the virus will do over the winter months, to keep our economy open and fully functioning. ""We will continue to engage with businesses not just in the run-up to the enforcement of this on 18 October, we will do that afterwards as well so we are listening and understanding and working collectively to keep the country as safe as possible."" The vaccine certification scheme will require venues such as nightclubs to put in place a ""reasonable system"" to check the status of customers over the age of 18 The vaccine certification scheme will require venues to put in place a ""reasonable system"" to check the status of customers over the age of 18, with certain exemptions on medical grounds. Venues affected include nightclubs, unseated indoor events with more than 500 people, unseated outdoor events with more than 4,000 people, and any event with more than 10,000 people in attendance. Elsewhere in the UK, Wales plans to introduce its ownCovid passport ruleslater this month but England hasscrapped similar plans. Northern Ireland has yet to announce a formal vaccination passport scheme. The Scottish launch comes as latest figures show that a total of 4,189,701 people have received the coronavirus vaccine in Scotland, of which 3,837,689 people have received two doses.

"Estefan has spoken about the abuse for the first time Singer Gloria Estefan has revealed she was sexually abused by a family member when she was nine years old. The Cuban-American pop star, 64, said she was molested while at music school by someone her mother trusted. ""Ninety-three per cent of abused children know and trust their abusers. And I know this because I was one of them,"" she said. She spoke about the abuse for the first time in a Facebook Watch show alongside her grown-up daughter and niece. TV personality Clare Crawley also appeared on the episode ofRed Table Talk: The Estefans,external, and spoke about how she was abused by a priest. Ms Crawley said she had been abused by a ""counsellor"" while at Catholic school, and had been ""the victim of a predator"". ""I wanted to deal with this subject matter because it is so important to try to prevent. I also did not want to sit here quietly while you share and are brave,"" Ms Estefan told her. Ms Estefan, who sang such hits as Conga and Rhythm is Gonna Get You, said on the programme a distant relative had exploited her mother's trust to molest her. ""You've waited for this moment a long time,"" Ms Estefan's niece, Lili, 54, told her. ""I have,"" the singer replied. ""He was family, but not close family. He was in a position of power because my mother had put me in his music school and he immediately started telling her how talented I was and how I needed special attention, and she felt lucky that he was focusing this kind of attention on me,"" she said. Ms Estefan, who was born in Cuba but moved to Miami with her family when she was a toddler, said the abuse started ""little by little and then it goes fast"". The three-time Grammy Award-winner said she was aware that she was in a ""dangerous"" situation, but could not ward the man off. ""I told him, 'This cannot happen, you cannot do this.' He goes: 'Your father's in Vietnam, your mother's alone and I will kill her if you tell her,'"" Estefan said. ""I knew the man was insane and that's why I thought he might actually hurt my mother."" The anxiety made her lose chunks of hair, she said, and eventually she told her mother about what was happening. Although her mother informed the police, they advised her not to press charges because she would ""go through worse trauma having to get on a stand and testify"".

"Shakira (pictured in 2020) was in Barcelona, Spain, when the animals attacked Pop superstar Shakira says she was the victim of a random attack by a pair of wild boars while walking in a park in Barcelona with her eight-year-old son. The Colombian singer said the animals attacked her, before seizing her bag and retreating with it into the woods. She shared her bizarre tale in a series of Instagram stories on Wednesday. Holding the now recovered but torn bag towards the camera, she said: ""Look at how two wild boar which attacked me in the park have left my bag."" ""They were taking my bag to the woods with my mobile phone in it,"" the singer continued. ""They've destroyed everything."" She then turned to her son, whose father is the Barcelona footballer Gerard PiquÃ©, and said: ""Milan tell the truth. Say how your mummy stood up to the wild boar."" Shakira is the latest victim of the increasingly aggressive hogs which have invaded the Catalan capital in recent years. In 2016, Spanish police received 1,187 phone calls about wild hogs attacking dogs, plundering cat-feeders, holding up traffic and running into cars in the city. In 2013, one city police officer attempted to take charge of the problem himself and shot at a boar with his service revolver, but missed and hit his partner instead. Boars, which can carry a wide variety of diseases, are listed among the world's most invasive species and can survive in almost any environment. But increasingly the animals are drawn to cities, where they live off rubbish discarded by humans. Their numbers have exploded across Europe, with the latest estimates now surpassing around 10 million across the continent. As they have become more aggressive and more of a nuisance, many cities have employed a variety of strategies to cull their numbers. In Berlin, urban hunters have killed thousands of the animals but the problem persists. Last yearpolice officers in Rome sparked outrageafter they shot a family of wild boar that had wandered into a children's playground with tranquiliser darts and gave them lethal injections.

"Ann Jones has run Menai Travel for 15 years The owner of a travel agency says she has resorted to cashing in her pension to pay her staff as furlough ends. Ann Jones, who owns Menai Travel, in Caernarfon, Gwynedd, said: ""I don't want to lose my staff, they are like family and help run the business."" The UK's furlough schemeends on Thursday. It comes ahead of the Â£20-a-week boost to universal credit, introduced in response to the pandemic, isdue to officially end on 6 October. It was introduced in March 2020 and helped pay the wages of 11.6 million workers after large parts of the economy were shut down due to the coronavirus pandemic. Why you might not get what you want this Christmas 'Amazing to be back' to work after 18 months on furlough 'I had no real sense of purpose on furlough' Ann Jones has been campaigning for help for her industry At the end of July it was still supporting the incomes of about 1.6 million workers, the latest HMRC figures show. What will happen when furlough ends? Wales partly agrees to relax travel rules Ms Jonestold BBC Radio Walesshe was ""not happy"" the scheme was ending and has been protesting to try and get the scheme extended throughout the winter. She said she had barely made any revenue in the last two years. ""It's not an easy life being in the travel industry,"" she said. She said if the government continued to ease travel restrictions ""things will get moving again"", adding: ""It's going to take all winter for me to start seeing some proper revenue coming into the business."" ""The government said they've given specific support for every industry - they've given it to the airlines, but not small high-street travel businesses,"" she said. ""It is heart-breaking for me to build up my business over the years... I just feel I'm just a number to them and not a person."" This video can not be played ""Difficult conversations"" as furlough ends in Wales Liz Lewis, from Creigiau, Cardiff, organises education trips abroad for a coach company and said with no sign of foreign trips for pupils returning she was uncertain about her next steps. She said furlough had been ""a lifeline"", adding: ""There is some anxiety around what the future holds."" ""Without those high-value trips, it would be difficult to operate really and the company might not be able to afford how it's staffed at the moment."" UK furlough scheme ends amid calls for further support Furlough cut 'could push businesses off cliff edge Why are hospitality workers leaving the industry? Ms Lewis, who was on flexi-furlough working three hours a week, said she may have to take redundancy if there is no capacity for her company to bring her back full-time. Liz Lewis, who organises education trips abroad for a coach company, said furlough had been ""a lifeline"" That would have ""financial implications"" for her, with one daughter studying in London and the other at a ski academy in Austria. But she said she was ""optimistic things will be okay"" after seeing other colleagues move into roles outside of travel after redundancy. Jonathan Greeatorex is owner of The Hand at Llanarmon hotel near Llangollen, where all 25 staff are now back at work. He told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast with Claire Summers furlough had been a lifeline. ""I remember those dark days in March 2020 when Rishi Sunak announced furlough and I'm not going to lie, I burst into tears with relief,"" he said. ""I had single mums looking at me saying 'Jonathan how am I going to put food on the table? How am I going to pay my rent?' And it genuinely was a lifeline."" He said he feared other industries, including travel were ""staring down the barrel of a jobs Armageddon"" as furlough ends before they have been able to financially recover from the pandemic. Save the Children in Wales raised concerns over the impact on families and said the UK  government should make theÂ£20 increase to Universal Creditpermanent. Its head Melanie Simmonds said:  ""The end of the furlough scheme will spell more uncertainty and financial worry for many families across Wales. And it's coming at a time when lots of parents are facing rising energy bills, higher prices for food and transport, and the extra spending on essentials like heating and warm clothes that comes every autumn. This is all leading to a perfect storm of falling incomes and rising costs."" Natasha Harper, who runs a foodbank, said the cut in the universal credit uplift would hit people hard Natasha Harper runs the foodbank and community hub at Rhyl's Good News Family church in Denbighshire. She said they have seen an increase in demand for their support and one service user has told her: ""'I'm going to be Â£17 worse off each month and there's nowhere else I can pinch that Â£17 from."" ""That's the reality that we're seeing daily,"" she said. She said the cut in the universal credit uplift would hit hard. ""We've had families come to us and say 'we wanted to put that in our savings pot' but the reality has been they've had to use that. ""So that cut of Â£20 a week for us is nothing, it's a couple of coffees, but for them it's like a week's food. And these are not isolated incidents. We're going to see a massive influx of people in need."" HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) figures show 54,700 were still on furlough in Wales in July - that breaks down to 25,900 women and 28,700 men. In June last year, 378,400 jobs in Wales were furloughed and 108,000 self-employed workers were supported. A HM Treasury spokesperson said: ""We deliberately went long with our support to provide certainty to people and businesses over the summer; and that support is continuing with reduced business rates and cuts to VAT in place until March 2022, and the furlough scheme running until the end of September. ""The Universal Credit uplift was always intended to be a temporary measure to help households through the pandemic, but we are continuing to support people and ensure they have the skills and opportunities they need to get great jobs.""

Shoppers in Wales have already seen some empty shelves which has been blamed on a lack of lorry drivers. Now, some business owners are warning supply and delivery issues could affect Christmas stock. Matthew Hunt, of Filco Foods supermarkets, said he expected to see higher prices this winter. He urged shoppers to get orders in early. Next warns of staff shortages and price rises Farmers warn of Christmas turkey shortage What's in short supply and why?

"This video can not be played Relatives waited for news after police stormed the jail in Guayaquil where a deadly riot took place Desperate families have gathered at a jail in Ecuador which police are trying to bring under control after fighting left at least 118 inmates dead. The battle first broke out on Tuesday, with prisoners using explosives and firearms on each other. Families are seeking news on loved ones but with some victims decapitated or dismembered, identifying the bodies could take days. The gang-related violence is the worst in Ecuador's history. What is happening inside the Guayas prison complex, also known as the Litoral Penitentiary, is unclear. Officials said on Wednesday the jail was back under their control, but early on Thursday neighbours said they had heard explosions and gunshots. Late on Thursday, police regained control of the prison following a major operation involving 900 officers and army soldiers. the authorities said. Police commander Tannya Varela told Reuters the death toll could rise further as security forces work their way through the jail. ""We have not yet completed the intervention in the penitentiary, so it is possible that there are other bodies inside, and some of the injured could die from their wounds,"" she said. The fight first broke out on Tuesday when inmates from one wing of the prison crawled through a hole to gain access to a different wing, where they attacked rival gang members. Inmates climbed onto the roof of the Litoral prison as a deadly fight unfolded Police managed to get six cooks, who were trapped in the wing where the fight happened, to safety and only two police officers were injured. Ecuador's prison director, BolÃ­var GarzÃ³n, said that police had entered the prison on Tuesday and found 24 bodies. According to Mr GarzÃ³n, there was renewed shooting inside the prison overnight Tuesday into Wednesday and as police went through the prison wings one by one, they found scores more bodies, bringing the death toll to 116. With security forces inside and outside of the jail, families of inmates face an anxious wait. Some of the relatives said they had been sent photos and video from inside the prison but had been given no official confirmation as to whether their family member was among the victims. Newspaper El Comercio reported that one woman had recognised her husband in one of the videos. She said he was one of those who had been decapitated. By Blanca Moncada Pesantes, Guayaquil When Ecuador's President Guillermo Lasso announced that the death toll had risen to 116 from the initial 24, dozens of families rushed to the forensic laboratory where the bodies of the victims are being taken. They want to find out where their loved ones are and if they are still alive. They have yet to get an answer and their anxiety only increased as explosions could again be heard coming from Guayaquil's biggest prison, a sign that the gang war inside - said to be linked to the drugs trade - had not been brought under control. Among them is Zenaida Moreira, 50, whose 23-year-old son was sent to the prison two years ago for stealing chairs from a school. Ms Moreira fears the worst after having seen videos of the carnage inside the jail. ""I don't know if one of the bodies I saw was his. I saw a decapitated head, the face is similar to his, but the authorities are not saying anything."" Read full story here The fact that only two police officers have been injured but more than 100 inmates killed strongly suggests this is a war among inmates rather than an attempt at a prison uprising. Local media are reporting that the brutal killings could have been ordered from outside the prison mirroring a power struggle between Mexican cartels currently under way in Ecuador. The Litoral Penitentiary holds inmates from Los Choneros, an Ecuadorean gang which is thought to have links with Mexico's powerful Sinaloa drugs cartel. The prison houses members of rival gangs with links to Mexican drug cartels But another Mexican criminal group, the Jalisco New Generation cartel (CJNG), is also trying to forge alliances with Ecuadorean gangs to seize control of drug smuggling routes leading from Ecuador to Central America from its Sinaloa rivals. The decapitations and the brutal nature of the violence seen inside the Litoral prison are hallmarks of the Mexican cartels, which often kill their rivals in the most gruesome ways to spread further terror. This most recent prison fight is the deadliest in the history of Ecuador's prison system but there have been a number of brutal confrontations in the past year. In February, 79 prisoners were killed in simultaneous fights at four jails, one of them Litoral Penitentiary. Ecuador is a transit country for cocaine smuggled from neighbouring Peru and Colombia, and the powerful Mexican drug cartels are said to operate through local gangs. Inside jails there are problems with overcrowding and a shortage of guards. Police are often met with prisoners who are heavily armed. After the latest incident, President Lasso declared a state of emergency in the prison system, which allows officials to suspend certain rights and use the military to regain control. He also said support would be provided to inmates' relatives.

The PRA, which represents independent fuel retailers, said that more than a quarter (27%) of its members' were still out of fuel on Thursday. That was better than the 37% which were out of fuel on Tuesday, but demand remained higher than usual, it said. However the AA said it saw signs that the pressure was starting to ease. The PRA, which represents nearly 5,500 of the UK's 8,300 petrol stations, said Thursday's figures were based on responses from 1,500 stations. ""Trying to calm this down appears to be a monumental task at the moment,"" said PRA chairman Brian Madderson. ""The surge in demand appears to be continuing,"" he said. ""There's been no easing off of the pressure from drivers wanting to refuel whenever they can, wherever they can."" The UK has been grappling with a fuel crisis that has caused huge queues outside some petrol stations, and forced customers to drive round multiple sites in search of supplies. While the government and industry said there was enough fuel at UK refineries, a shortage of drivers has slowed the transport of fuel to petrol stations. The government said it was seeing the ""first signs"" of demand for fuel stabilising, and stressed there was no shortage of fuel. The AA also said it saw signs that the pressure on fuel pumps was starting to ease. The motoring group said that the number of call-outs from drivers who had run out of fuel had initially increased sharply and was ""in the hundreds"" over the weekend. But it said those numbers were now falling rapidly. Although some queues remain in London, the South East and some other built-up areas, AA president Edmund King said daily improvements were now visible. ""We believe we have turned the corner,"" he said. The PRA told the BBC that it had also received ""anecdotal"" evidence that the problems were more acute in London and the South East. It said that Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales appeared to be ""mostly ok"". The PRA's Mr Madderson said he had written to the government this morning to warn them that the price of petrol and diesel at the pump was likely to rise, after a rise in the price of Brent Crude oil. A fall in the value of the pound against the dollar would also push up prices for UK customers, he said. ""Those two [factors] have already started to impinge on wholesale prices, which have gone up - in the last three nights - by nearly 3p a litre,"" he said. Petrol shortage: Is the fuel crisis improving? Petrol supply: Army put on standby to ease fuel crisis Government plans to use the army to address some of the delivery problems in the coming days would help to ease the problems, Mr Madderson said, but the main thing that was required was a change in public behaviour. ""Let's just try and calm it down please,"" he said. He said he understood that the army could be helping with deliveries by the weekend. The majority of sites completely out of stock were BP franchisees, Mr Madderson said, adding the PRA was talking to BP about the issues they were facing. BP told the BBC it was ""working flat out to keep our petrol stations stocked and restock them when they run out"". Some of the government's reserve tanker fleet is stationed in Fenstanton, Cambridgeshire Long queues and frustrated customers have led to multiple reports on social media of abuse of service station staff. BBC broadcast engineerSimon Hardwick tweeted,external: ""Chatting with a member of staff at a supermarket petrol station, who said they are getting deliveries but within a few hours they sell out again. He also mentioned the abuse he's been receiving from members of the public."" Industry leaders have condemned physical and verbal abuse suffered by service station employees during the crisis. Gordon Balmer, the executive director of the PRA, said the abuse was ""completely unacceptable"". ""It is important to remember that fuel stocks remain normal at refineries and terminals, and deliveries have been reduced solely due to the shortage of HGV drivers"", he added. The haulage industry said an existing shortage of lorry drivers had been made worse by a number of factors, including the pandemic, Brexit, an ageing workforce, and low wages and poor working conditions. In an attempt to limit disruption,the government has confirmedthat 5,000 fuel tanker and food lorry drivers can receive temporary UK visas, with the scheme ending on Christmas Eve. The Road Haulage Association said, however, the recent move ""barely scratches the surface"", adding that only offering visas until Christmas Eve ""will not be enough for companies or the drivers themselves to be attractive"". A spokesman for the government said it had taken ""immediate action"" to increase the numbers of HGV drivers. ""We recognise the challenges facing industry and streamlined the testing process in July to boost the number of drivers,"" he added. Meanwhile, petrol station group EG said its workers would get a 5% pay rise for ""heroic"" work since the start of the Covid pandemic. The wage increase takes the minimum rate for over-18s to Â£9.50 per hour at EG Group, which was founded by the Asda-owning Issa brothers. Mohsin and Zuber Issa, the billionaire co-founders and co-chief executives of the group, said: ""Our colleagues have pulled out all the stops and been nothing short of heroic during often very difficult times since the start of the pandemic. ""It is due to their hard work and dedication that EG has continued to be a growth business, performing strongly over the past 12 months. ""We are grateful to each and every one of them for their contributions and are therefore making a total reward package available to them which we believe is among the best in the country."" EG Group was founded in 2001 and has more than 45,000 staff working in more than 6,200 sites in Europe, the US and Australia. Is the fuel crisis improving?

"The silver medieval annular brooch from the 12th to 13th centuries was found by David Johnston Two silver medieval brooches found in fields in Pembrokeshire have been officially declared treasure by a coroner. Both brooches were found independently by metal detectorists. David Johnston and Kevin Higgs both made their finds in 2019. They will now be independently valued before being offered to museums for sale. Tenby Museum & Art Gallery and Scolton Manor Park & Museum are looking to acquire the brooches. The age of the brooches mean they could have been worn around the time freedom fighter William Wallace was executed by the English, or as the bubonic plague swept through Europe. The Â£3m crime which 'deprived heritage' 'I dream of a find that changes history' Detectorist finds stolen treasures on first hunt Mr Johnston found his silver brooch from the 12th to 13th centuries on 10 March 2019, in a field in Penally. Eloise Chapman, from Tenby Museum & Art Gallery, said the museum had nothing like Mr Johnston's find in its collection. ""This lovely little brooch will provide an insight for our visitors into medieval fashion and everyday life in the Tenby area,"" she said. Mr Higgs' brooch is missing its pin Mr Higgs found his brooch, which dates back to the 13 to 14th centuries, on 24 April 2019, in Ambleston. Dr Mark Redknap, from National Museum Wales, said: ""Silver brooches decorated with niello were popular across medieval Wales and this small example may have fastened clothing made of fine cloth."" He said that through the Treasure Act ""we are building a more accurate picture of fashion in the medieval period"". The Treasure Act allows for the sale price to be shared among the finder and the owner of the land. 2021 BAFTA CYMRU NOMINATED:Watch the cream of the crop ARTS AND HERITAGE:Lose yourself in Welsh creativity and culture 'I dream of a find that changes history' The Â£3m crime which 'deprived heritage' Detectorist finds stolen treasures on first hunt Night-time curfew imposed in fire-hit areas of LA as police warn against 'despicable' looting 'I have nothing to go back to' - BBC reporter tells of LA fires heartbreak Trump avoids prison or fine in hush-money case sentencing LA fires: How three days of devastation unfolded What's the latest on the Los Angeles wildfires and what caused them?

"This video can not be played Listen to the words from the victim statement of Sarah Everard's mother, Susan, as voiced by an actor The family of Sarah Everard confronted her murderer in court and laid bare their loss and anguish. These are their victim impact statements in full. The following accounts contain details which readers may find distressing. Sarah is gone and I am broken-hearted. She was my precious little girl, our youngest child. The feeling of loss is so great it is visceral. And with the sorrow come waves of panic at not being able to see her again. I can never talk to her, never hold her again, and never more be a part of her life. We have kept her dressing gown - it still smells of her and I hug that instead of her. Sarah died in horrendous circumstances. I am tormented at the thought of what she endured. I play it out in my mind. I go through the terrible sequence of events. I wonder when she realised she was in mortal danger; I wonder what her murderer said to her. When he strangled her, for how long was she conscious, knowing she would die? It is torture to think of it. Sarah was handcuffed, unable to defend herself, and there was no one to rescue her. She spent her last hours on this earth with the very worst of humanity. She lost her life because Wayne Couzens wanted to satisfy his perverted desires. It is a ridiculous reason, it is nonsensical. How could he value a human life so cheaply? I cannot comprehend it. I am incandescent with rage at the thought of it. He treated my daughter as if she was nothing and disposed of her as if she was rubbish. If Sarah had died because of an illness, she would have been cared for. We could have looked after her and been with her. If she had died because of an accident, people would have tried to help - there would have been kindness. But there is no comfort to be had, there is no consoling thought in the way Sarah died. In her last hours she was faced with brutality and terror, alone with someone intent on doing her harm. The thought of it is unbearable. I am haunted by the horror of it. Sarah Everard: Daughter, sister, friend and colleague Couzens handcuffed Sarah Everard in false arrest When Sarah went missing we suffered days of agony, not knowing where she was or what had happened to her. Then, when Sarah's burnt remains were found, we spent two terrible days waiting for tests to show how she had died, fearing she had been set alight before she was dead - the thought was appalling. Burning her body was the final insult, it meant we could never again see her sweet face and never say goodbye. Our lives will never be the same. We should be a family of five, but now we are four. Her death leaves a yawning chasm in our lives that cannot be filled. I yearn for her. I remember all the lovely things about her. She was caring, she was funny. She was clever, but she was good at practical things too. She was a beautiful dancer. She was a wonderful daughter. She was always there to listen, to advise, or simply to share with the minutiae of the day. And she was also a strongly principled young woman who knew right from wrong and who lived by those values. She was a good person. She had purpose to her life. My outlook on life has changed since Sarah died. I am more cautious, I worry more about our other children. I crave the familiarity and security of home - the wider world has lost its appeal. It is too painful to contemplate a future without Sarah, so I just live in the here and now. I think of Sarah all the time, but the mornings and evenings are particularly painful. In the morning I wake up to the awful reality that Sarah is gone. In the evenings, at the time she was abducted, I let out a silent scream: Don't get in the car, Sarah. Don't believe him. Run! I am repulsed by the thought of Wayne Couzens and what he did to Sarah. I am outraged that he masqueraded as a policeman in order to get what he wanted. Sarah wanted to get married and have children - now all that has gone. He took her life and stole her future and we will never have the joy of sharing that future with her. Each day dawns and I think Sarah should be here, leading her life and embracing new experiences. She had so many years ahead of her. I don't know how anyone could be so cruel as to take my daughter's life. What I do know is that Sarah will never be forgotten and is remembered with boundless love. I cling on to memories of Sarah, I hold them tight to keep them safe. The other night, I dreamt that Sarah appeared at home. In my dream I held her and could feel her physically. Jeremy was there, we were comforting her, saying: 'It's all right Sarah, it's all right'. I would give anything to hold her once more. I hope I dream that dream again. There's a photograph of my beautiful daughter on the screen. She had a beautiful mind too. Mr Couzens, please, will you look at me? The impact of what you have done will never end. The horrendous murder of my daughter, Sarah, is in my mind all the time and will be for the rest of my life. A father wants to look after his children and fix everything, and you have deliberately and with premeditation stopped my ability to do that. Sarah was handcuffed and unable to defend herself. This preys on my mind all the time. I can never forgive you for what you have done, for taking Sarah away from us. You burnt our daughter's body â you further tortured us â so that we could not see her again. We did not know whether you had burnt her alive or dead. You stopped us seeing Sarah for one last time and stopped me from giving my daughter one last kiss goodbye. Jeremy Everard (left), Sarah's father, said no punishment could compare to the family's pain and torture Her body fell apart when she was moved. Her brain and neck bones were removed for months by the pathologist and her body was difficult to preserve so we had to use the services of a specialist embalmer to enable a dignified burial. All my family want is Sarah back with us. No punishment that you receive will ever compare to the pain and torture that you have inflicted on us. You murdered our daughter and forever broke the hearts of her mother, father, brother, sister, family and her friends. Sarah had so much to look forward to and because of you this is now gone forever. She was saving to buy a house and looking forward to marriage and children. We were looking forward to having grandchildren. We loved being a part of Sarah's world and expected her to have a full and happy life. The closest we can get to her now is to visit her grave every day You treated Sarah as if she was nothing. Placed more emphasis on satisfying your sick disgusting perversions than on a life. Her life. You disposed of my sister's body like it was rubbish. Fly-tipped her like she meant nothing. She meant everything. We couldn't even see her, she was so badly burnt. Her brain was removed from her skull to check for trauma and cause of death - I still don't know if they put her brain back in her head or whether it is lying next to her body in her coffin. Shards of her kneecap were returned to us to be placed with her body - shards that you knocked when moving her burnt body from the fridge you had used to hide her and conceal the fire. We are still missing her hyoid bone from her throat, which is being checked to see the force you used to strangle her, to determine how long she may have survived. We know it was broken. Her burnt body still had her necklace and one earring in her ear. The other had fallen from her ear because it had burnt off. You hear from the police that it takes around two minutes to strangle someone, and around eight to ten seconds for them to lose consciousness. At first there is a sense of relief at hearing that your sister might only have been aware of what was happening for eight to 10 seconds. But have you put your hands around your neck and tried pushing hard? Eight to 10 seconds now seems a long time. You used your warrant card to trick my sister into your car. She sat in a car, handcuffed, for hours. What could she have thought she had done wrong? What lies did you tell her? When did she realise that she wasn't going to survive the night? I'm constantly replaying in my head - did you rape her, then kill her? Did you kill her while raping her? You get small nuggets of information and the thought process starts again. Your semen and blood were found in your car. So this suggests you raped her in the car. You find out you may have used a belt to strangle her. New horrendous images forming. You stopped to get a Lucozade and water at a petrol station. Was she still alive at this point? Bound in your car? I am horrified by your ability to flit between what you did and normal, everyday actions. Your casual demeanour on CCTV was very upsetting and shocking to see. Family members repeatedly asked killer Wayne Couzens to look at them as he hung his head in the dock We had to go to the flat and pack up Sarah's whole life - washing left hanging up, half-sewn outfits, deliveries waiting to be returned, packages waiting at the door ready to be opened. All signs of a life waiting to be lived, chores to be done, ready for her to return and continue when she got home. But she never got home because a predator - you - was on the loose. Prowling the streets for hours looking for his prey. You can't comprehend what you are being told when it happened because it is so horrific. Some sort of sick waking nightmare. You can't imagine anyone could do such a thing. You are waiting to hear anything from the police. Every bit you get is different. You hear her body has been found. Then you find out she has been burnt. So badly burnt you can't see her. Can't see her again to say goodbye. The first thought you have in your head after despair and shock is - was she dead before you burnt her? Imagine that even having to be a thought. You find out no soot was found in her lungs, which suggests she was burnt after you murdered her. Imagine being relieved to hear your sister was dead before she was burnt. I replay it continuously round in my head. What you may have said to her, what she may have said back, when she realised she was in grave danger and was not going to survive. Hoping my sister was unconscious and drugged, but we know that was not the case - no drugs found in her body, no trauma to the head. Burst blood vessels in her brain from your strangulation, which meant she was conscious when you were doing these unfathomable things to her. My only hope is that she was in a state of shock and that she wasn't aware of the disgusting things being done to her by a monster. When you forced yourself upon and raped her. When you put your hands around her neck and strangled her. It disgusts me that you were the last person to touch her perfect body, and violate her in the way you did. The last person to see her alive and speak to her. How scared she must have been. The last moments of her life not with loved ones, but frightened and fighting for her life. I hate to think of her being so scared and alone and that in her last moments she had no one with her. No kindness. I hate that I wasn't there to save her. To stop you. I find it hard to believe she is not just living her own life and sick at the thought that her last moments on this earth alive were so horrific. How dare you take her from me? Take away her hopes and dreams. Her life. Children that will never be born. Generations that will never exist. Her future no longer exists. The future I was supposed to live with my sister no longer exists. You have ruined so many lives. Sarah is the very best person, with so many people who love and cherish her. I want to speak to her and hug her and hear her laugh and go out for dinners and drinks and dancing. All those conversations we can never have. There were so many things I wanted to share with her - trips abroad, being each other's bridesmaids, meeting her babies and being an auntie, growing old together and seeing who got the most wrinkles. We weren't even halfway through our journey and you took it all away. I feel like I live in a make-believe world, as if nothing is real. I have to pretend because the thought of not having Sarah forever is too hard to bear. A lifetime now seems a very long time. I should never have to write a eulogy for or bury my little sister. There is no punishment that you could receive that will ever compare to the pain you have caused us. We can never get Sarah back. The last moments of Sarah's life play on my mind constantly. I am so disgusted and appalled. It terrifies me that you have such disregard for a person's life. You have taken from me the most precious person. And I can never get her back.

"The new school lunch menus start on Monday About 500 schools will be offering a reduced lunch menu from next week due to the national lorry driver shortage. Lancashire County Council (LCC), which provides 65,000 meals a day, said food deliveries were being hit by the issue. Education bosses have still promised a healthy meal every day for each child while stock levels are replenished. From Monday, schools will focus on providing jacket potatoes, soups and sandwiches rather than a full menu. Fresh fruit will still be available. Yogurt and daily dessert options, as well as fresh organic milk or drinking water, complete the temporary menus. This video can not be played Headteacher Julie Goodwin says her pupils will be fed properly Jayne Rear, the county council's cabinet member for education and skills, said: ""We're reducing the menu for all our schools to make it fair for everybody. ""We will reduce it for a couple of weeks so we can replenish our stocks hopefully to be back running after half-term. ""It has been so, so difficult to recruit drivers and it is across the country and we are doing all we can."" As the fourth largest authority in England, LCC procures a large amount of food and drink, with 80% of meals freshly prepared and cooked in school kitchens. The authority said it has strict specifications for its school meals. All of its suppliers are classified as ""local"" while 75% of the food it purchases is produced in the UK. Jayne Rear hopes full menus will be restored after half-term Julie Goodwin, headteacher of St Lawrence CE Primary School in Barton, said: ""I'm happy the menu we are providing meets all the nutritional requirements. ""We are going to try and jig it around a little bit. ""The bottom line is that they are going to get a warm meal and there will be a variety.

"Leigh Faulkner's flat was in the Victoria Wharf development in Cardiff Bay Leigh Faulkner's two-bed flat had been worth around Â£175,000 but he sold it for Â£50,000 less after post-Grenfell fire safety problems emerged. The 54-year-old father-of-two decided to ""take the hit"" financially because of uncertainty over government help. He said he felt ""robbed"" when he sold the Cardiff Bay flat for Â£125,000. A Welsh government fund for surveys to establish what repairs buildings require opens for applications on Thursday. Housing minister Julie James said her ""heart goes out"" to those affected, but providing support was ""fiendishly complicated"". What makes cladding unsafe and what are your rights? 'Constant dread' of failed fire safety flat owners Fire fund 'too little, too late' for high-rise Campaigners have been increasingly frustrated at how long the Welsh government is taking to establish a repair fund. Many leaseholders in high-rise apartment blocks have found it impossible to sell as lenders will not provide buyers with mortgages on the properties. They are also facing significantly increased costs to cover insurance premiums and interim fire safety measures. Leigh Faulkner says he could not wait any longer and had to sell his flat After several years living and working in Dubai, the Faulkners moved back into their flat in Victoria Wharf, Cardiff Bay, in 2019 and started the hunt for a house. Before the cladding and other fire safety problems were identified, Mr Faulkner believed the flat was worth around Â£175,000. It was valued at Â£160,000 as part of a part-exchange for a new-build house in Dinas Powys, Vale of Glamorgan. But that deal fell through when the problems at Victoria Wharf came to light. With concerns about safety and his annual service charge rising to Â£5,000, he decided to sell the flat at auction in June. The home was bought by a property investment company. ""It was a tough decision, there was part of me wanted to tough it out and just see how things panned out with the developer.â¯ ""There wasn't much positive coming from Welsh government at the time, it was mostly talk.â¯ ""So it was that uncertainty that drove us finally to say, 'yeah, let's just take the hit'. ""Forty or 50 thousand doesn't sound a lot to some people, but I'm sure for most people to lose that is painful.""â¯ The sale enabled them to buy a house near Llantwit Major, a cheaper option than the one they had wanted in Dinas Powys. 'No Grenfell Tower type cladding here' Legal action threat over cladding support delay Homeowner's tears as cladding costs spiral Mr Faulkner said after leaving school with ""only a few GCSEs"" and working and saving all his life, it was a ""bitter pill to swallow"". ""We've done the right things, we've not spent frivolously on holidays, we've never spent money we never had. ""It does feel like somebody's just come in and taken that money out of my bank account in effect.""â¯ People who live in multi-occupied buildings over 36ft (11m) will be eligible to apply for the survey fund Bex Ashwin from campaign group Welsh Cladiators said the opening of the fund was welcome but questioned if ministers ""fully understand the urgency of the situation"". ""It is also not clear if this will be of any benefit to the number of flats who have already had to undertake survey work at significant cost,"" she said. Asked why the Welsh government was only now at the stage of opening a fund for survey work, Ms James said: ""Because it's so fiendishly complicated is the short answer to that. ""It's nothing to do with how desperate we are to help people get themselves out of this situation. ""I don't say this lightly at all, my heart goes out to people who are stuck in this situation, it's awful. ""But we need to get it right, we need to not make a mess of it and we need to make sure we are funding the right things. ""I know it must seem glacial to the people out there living with this day to day but it's so complicated to do we wanted to get it right so I'm very pleased to be announcing it, now we hope that people will come forward immediately."" She said further funding ""of various sorts"" for repair work would be developed as surveys begin to be completed. She will meet developers next week to discuss their contribution and said she is still awaiting confirmation from the UK government about the ""level and timing"" of funding Wales will receive as a result of fire safety spending in England.

"The furlough scheme closes on Thursday, with uncertainty ahead for people who have not yet fully returned to work. Nearly one million workers were expected to be on the scheme at the end of September, according to research by the Resolution Foundation. Of those on furlough in late July, about half on the scheme were able to work some of the time, the HMRC says. Since the start of the pandemic, it has helped paythe wages of 11.6 million workers,external. But many forecasters, including the Bank of England, are expecting a small rise in unemployment as it ends. The chancellor said he was ""immensely proud"" of the near Â£70bn scheme, but now was the right time to close it, despite calls for further support from some badly-hit companies. What will happen when furlough ends? What impact has the furlough scheme had? The travel sector has suffered more than most during the pandemic, with businesses being affected by changing restrictions and lower consumer confidence. Mark Andrew, the director of Animal Aircare, which helps pets travel overseas via Gatwick Airport, said some of his staff may be made redundant if business does not improve. The firm has not yet had to lay off staff, which Mr Andrew said was ""purely down to furlough"". Animal Aircare staff help pets travel overseas via Gatwick Airport ""Furlough ending means there's a real question mark for our business. We're still waiting for Gatwick to pick up... it seems the airline industry is not buoyant enough yet,"" he said. Although the end of the scheme comes amida record number of job vacancies, Fidelity International's investment director, Maike Currie, told the BBC that ""no-one really knows what is next"". ""I think what we can be certain of is that we'll see under-employment, where employees return to work but possibly not on a full-time basis and that they might need to supplement their income."" Unemployment rate: How many people are out of work? How do I find a new job and who is hiring? What are my rights if I am made redundant? Furlough was introduced in March 2020 after Covid-19 forced large parts of the UK economy to close. Officially known as the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, it saw the government pay towards the wages of people who could not work, or whose employers could no longer afford to pay them, up to a monthly limit of Â£2,500. At first it paid 80% of their usual wage, but in August and September it paid 60%, with employers paying 20%. There have been big recruitment drives for hospitality staff, HGV drivers and warehouse workers as businesses get back on their feet. This video can not be played Abi is finally back to work after 18 months on furlough and says it feels 'amazing' Latest official figures,externalshow the UK's economy grew by 5.5% between April and June - revised up from the initial estimate of 4.8%. The uplift was largely driven by household spending rebounding after lockdowns, although many firms are now being held back by current labour shortages. ""Any hope that the end of the furlough scheme might be the magic wand to solve the supply chain crisis is likely to be wishful thinking,"" said Susannah Streeter, from Hargreaves Lansdown. There is likely to be a big mismatch of skills and experience between those leaving the furlough scheme and the jobs on offer, she added. Chief Secretary to the Treasury Simon Clarke told the BBC: ""We think there are probably two million fewer people unemployed than would have been the case if this scheme hadn't been introduced. ""I think it's done an enormous amount to shield our economy and our society from the worst of Covid."" The scheme has also been praised by the Resolution Foundation think tank as a ""great success"". Its senior economist Dan Tomlinson said furlough had been ""as critical to fighting the Covid crisis as nationalising the banks was to fighting the global financial crisis"". But the foundation's recent research,externalsuggested that a small rise in unemployment was a ""real risk"" for those still on the scheme as it ends, particularly older workers or those in the travel sector. When the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme started, it was described as a bridge over the pandemic uncertainty. It has succeeded in keeping the official unemployment numbers at less than half pre-pandemic expectation. For that reason it has proven value for money, despite costing over Â£68bn. But there is now some uncertainty over the fate of the million or so workers still having their wages subsidised. New analysis from the Institute for Fiscal Studies points to regional differences, with London workers for example the most likely still to be furloughed. Older workers are also disproportionately still on the scheme. Industries that are yet to return to normal, such as the airport sector, had called for the scheme to be kept in some form. Unions also argue that the UK should follow Germany in maintaining a form of the scheme for future crises. Certainly a precedent has been set in that the government is willing to spend billions on wage increases if large-scale increases in unemployment are avoided. Although a million vacancies do not map on to the same number still on furlough, it is clear that many industries are having to welcome back more furloughed workers. Partly out of fear of being caught out by worker shortages later down the line. For many of those returning to work, conditions will not be the same as pre-pandemic. Jess Pitman was furloughed from her job as marketing manager at a travel firm two weeks after the scheme was introduced. The company she works for specialises in organising trips abroad to raise money for charities, but travellers cancelled their plans when Covid hit. The firm's payroll has been reduced from 27 to just five and the 29-year-old will return to work part-time, topping up her income with freelance work. Jess Pitman works for a travel firm, which organises fundraising trips for charity ""I feel really torn about the end of furlough, and I'm really sad for the travel industry as a whole,"" Jess said. ""I know a lot of people in the industry will be made redundant... I think we'll lose a lot of talented people, which is really disappointing."" A spokesperson for the Association of British Travel Agents (Abta) warned that companies in the sector still face ""extreme difficulties"" because of continued travel restrictions. Abta called for sector-specific support for smaller firms in particular, who have lost two summers of sales, as well as those which specialise in destinations still subject to red list rules. ""The government needs to look at how it can support these businesses... through a package of tailored financial support,"" the spokesperson added. Elsewhere, the Federation of Small Businesses also cited concerns over a ""colder environment"" for business. Employers and workers alike will have to cope with the end of the furlough scheme, as well as the scrapping of an incentive for hiring apprentices, rising energy bills and the planned cut to Universal Credit in October. However, the Treasury said generous support was being provided through its ""Plan for Jobs"", which it said was part of a Â£400bn spending package. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said he was ""immensely proud of the furlough scheme, and even more proud of UK workers and businesses whose resolve has seen us through an immensely difficult time"".

"The body of Sarah Everard was found hidden in woodland Met Police officer Wayne Couzens has been sentenced to a whole-life term for the murder of Sarah Everard, in a case that sparked national outrage and calls for more action to tackle violence against women. Couzens admitted the kidnap, rape and murder of the 33-year-old marketing executive when he appeared in court several months ago. But it was only during his sentencing that the full details of his crimes emerged. In full: Sarah Everard's family on their loss Does following the 'rules' keep women safe? Ms Everard was walking home from a friend's house in Clapham, south London, at about 21:30 BST on 3 March when she was abducted. Couzens' choice of victim was random, but the attack was planned. In his sentencing remarks, Lord Justice Fulford said there had been ""significant planning and premeditation"" by Couzens. The police officer had ""long planned to carry out a violent sexual assault on a yet-to-be-selected victim"" who he intended to coerce into his custody, noted the judge. Couzens spent at least a month travelling to London from Deal, Kent, where he lived, to research how best to carry out his crimes. Several days before the attack, he booked a hire car, which he would use for the abduction, as well as a roll of self-adhesive film advertised as a carpet protector on Amazon. After finishing a 12-hour shift at the US embassy that morning, Couzens, a parliamentary and diplomatic protection officer, went out ""hunting"" for a lone, young woman to kidnap and rape, the prosecution said. CCTV footage played in court showed Couzens and Ms Everard beside a vehicle on Poynders Road in Clapham The court heard how Couzens used the knowledge he had gained from working on Covid patrols in January and his Metropolitan Police-issue warrant card to trick his victim under the guise of a fake arrest for breaching coronavirus guidelines. The 48-year-old, who had been a police officer since 2002, handcuffed her before bundling her into the car and driving away. The abduction was witnessed by a couple travelling past in a car - but they believed they had seen an undercover police officer carrying out a legitimate arrest, so did not intervene. The whole kidnapping took less than five minutes. Couzens then drove to Dover in Kent, where he transferred Ms Everard to his own car, before travelling to a remote rural area nearby. It was there that he raped and murdered his victim - strangling her with his police belt. By 02:31 Couzens had left the scene and was spotted at a service station buying drinks. He visited the site where Ms Everard's body was dumped twice, leaving just before dawn. The next day, as the search for her escalated, Couzens bought petrol, which he used to burn her body inside a fridge. He also purchased two green rubble bags, which he used to dump the remains in a pond near an area of woodland he owned in Hoads Wood, Ashford. A week after she disappeared, Ms Everard's body was found in a woodland stream, just metres from land owned by Couzens. This video can not be played A CCTV timeline shows key evidence used to arrest and prosecute Wayne Couzens Meanwhile, Couzens returned to normal life, carrying out mundane activities like calling a vet about his dog. Days later, he even took his wife and two children on a family trip to the woods where he had burnt his victim's body. However, on the 8 March, the day he was due to return to work, he reported in sick. The following day he was arrested at his home in Deal. In a brief police interview, he told a false story about being threatened by an Eastern European gang, claiming they had demanded he deliver ""another girl"" after he had underpaid a prostitute a few weeks before. He then claimed he kidnapped Ms Everard, drove out of London and handed her over to three men in a van in a layby in Kent, while she was alive and uninjured. But after Ms Everard's body was discovered in a pond just 130 metres from land owned by Couzens, he was charged. This video can not be played In video from a police interview at his home on 9 March, Couzens denies knowing Sarah Everard Couzens has since been sacked by the Met, but the force is still facing questions over whether chances were missed to prevent his predatory behaviour. After Ms Everard's murder, the police watchdog announced it was probing alleged failures by the Met to investigate two indecent exposure incidents linked to Couzens in February. The Independent Office for Police Conduct is also investigating alleged failures by Kent Police to investigate a flashing incident linked to Couzens in 2015. Couzens transferred to the Met in 2018, from the Civil Nuclear Constabulary, where he had worked since 2011. Two years later he began working for the Parliamentary and Diplomatic Protection Command as an authorised firearms officer at diplomatic premises around central London. Wayne Couzens admitted murder, kidnap and rape In July, appearing by video link from Belmarsh high security jail, Couzens pleaded guilty to murder at the Old Bailey. On Wednesday he appeared in court again - this time in person - for a two-day sentencing hearing. There, he faced Ms Everard's mother, father and sister, who described to the court the torment of losing their loved one in such horrendous circumstances. Her father, Jeremy, demanded that Couzens looked at him as he told the murderer he could never forgive him for taking away his daughter. Her mother, Susan, said she was ""tormented"" at the thought of what her ""precious little girl"" had endured. ""I go through the sequence of events. I wonder when she realised she was in mortal danger,"" she told the court. ""Burning her body was the final insult. It meant we could never again see her sweet face and never say goodbye. ""Our lives will never be the same. We should be a family of five, but now we are four. Her death leaves a yawning chasm in our lives that cannot be filled.""

"Wayne Couzens admitted murder, kidnap and rape Police missed that Wayne Couzens' car linked him to an allegation of indecent exposure, a Met review into how he became an officer in London has found. Information that may have identified him as a potential sex offender was received by the force 72 hours before he killed Sarah Everard. The two unrelated reports, and how officers dealt with them, are being investigated by the Independent Office of Police Conduct (IOPC). Couzens willspend his life in prison. The IOPC is looking into the Met's handling of three potential incidents. The most recent one concerns whether officers ""responded appropriately"" when they were called toa fast-food restaurant in south Londonon 28 February, three days before the marketing executive was kidnapped. In a statement issued on Thursday night, the Met described the incident as being subject to ""a live criminal inquiry"". ""That crime was allocated for investigation but by the time of Sarah's abduction it was not concluded,"" the force said. It added it would ""re-evaluate our approach to indecent exposure"". How a police officer covered up Sarah Everard's murder Trust in police shaken by Everard case - Met chief In full: Sarah Everard's family on their loss Separately in 2015, Kent Police received a report of an alleged indecent exposure. Couzens was not named as the suspect, but the vehicle involved was identified. That information would have been enough to establish that Couzens was the owner. Speaking to reporters at Scotland Yard, Assistant Commissioner Nick Ephgrave said Kent Police had investigated the report and took no further action. He explained: ""One of a number of checks that forms part of the vetting process may not have been undertaken correctly when he joined the Met. ""This check related to a vehicle that was registered to Couzens that was linked to an allegation of indecent exposure that was reported to Kent Police in 2015."" The assistant commissioner said the review into the vetting of Couzens concluded that even if that information had been known, it would not have changed the outcome. However, the reasons for this remain unclear. Dame Cressida Dick said the case had ""brought shame on the Met"" The statement the Met issued on Thursday night added: ""We want the public to have confidence in our vetting and are taking extra measures to ensure our processes are the best they can be and address any potential weaknesses.â¯ ""Vetting is a snapshot in time and, unfortunately, can never 100% guarantee an individual's integrity."" Meanwhile, two senior Met officers told London Assembly's Police and Crime Committee they were not aware of rumours that Couzens was nicknamed ""the rapist"" by colleagues. However, HM Chief Inspector of Constabulary Sir Tom Winsor said the nickname was known by some officers. Sir Tom, who in his role has responsibility for the inspection of police forces, told the BBC Couzens ""also had allegedly a reputation in terms of drug abuse, extreme pornography and other offences of this kind"".

"Annual house price growth of 10% or more has been recorded for each of the past five months, according to data from the Nationwide. The UK's largest building society said that prices in September were up 10% compared with a year earlier, a slight slowdown from 11% in August. The double-digit rise was driven by recent activity in Wales and Northern Ireland, the lender said, with London still seeing the slowest growth. The typical home now costs Â£248,742. The epicentre of Britain's house price boom Young and low paid 'priced out' of tourist areas Rapidly rising house prices continues to create financial problems for potential first-time buyers, despite record low mortgage rates being offered by lenders. A recent report by the Office for National Statistics,external(ONS) said that people in tourist hotspots - which have become increasingly popular for relocating buyers - were at risk of being priced out of buying a home in the areas where they worked. Nationwide bases its house price estimates on its mortgage data, and Robert Gardner, the building society's chief economist, said that property values had continued to rise more quickly than earnings, which meant affordability was becoming more stretched. ""Raising a deposit remains the main barrier for most prospective first-time buyers. A 20% deposit on a typical first-time buyer home is now around 113% of gross income - a record high,"" he said. Karthik Srivats, co-founder of mortgage lender Ahauz, said: ""First-time buyers have been caught totally by surprise over the past year as the market has taken off. ""They have seen their budgets hammered in real terms and, while they have been helped by low rates and government support over the past year, gains in property values across the country have more than outweighed that leg up."" The stamp duty threshold in England and Northern Ireland will return to normal levels from Friday, after a holiday was temporarily put in place in last year, before being gradually reduced from July this year.

"The new school lunch menus start on Monday About 500 schools will be offering a reduced lunch menu from next week due to the national lorry driver shortage. Lancashire County Council (LCC), which provides 65,000 meals a day, said food deliveries were being hit by the issue. Education bosses have still promised a healthy meal every day for each child while stock levels are replenished.

We'll be back with more coronavirus news tomorrow. We are going to bring our live page updates to a close soon so here's a recap of some of the coronavirus developments we've been reporting today:  Just over 65,500 more Covid vaccine doses have been given in the UK. That's 31,539 first doses and 34,093 second jabs. That means a total of 48,829,118 people have had a first jab and 44,867,373 people have had two doses of a vaccine. Another 36,480 cases of coronavirus have been recorded in the UK, according to government statistics. And 137 people have died within 28 days of a positive Covid test. The temporary Â£20 increase to universal credit comes to an end in less than a week's time, on 6 October. Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng has suggested it could mean many UK households face a ""very difficult winter"". The government argues that as the economy opens up - and with a plethora of job vacancies currently available - the focus needs to shift to getting people back to work. The charity Citizens Advice has warned a third of people on Universal Credit will end up in debt when the extra payment is removed. Universal credit is claimed by more than 5.8 million people in England, Scotland and Wales - with almost 40% of them classed as being in employment. Today the government has announced Â£500m of grants to help families struggling with the cost of living as other support schemes are withdrawn, as energy costs soar and inflation rises. So how are people likely to affected by the cut - and what other benefits are available.Read on. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Beijing, host city of the

Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance reporter Annual house price growth of 10% or more has been recorded for each of the past five months, according to data from the Nationwide. The rapid rise in house prices continues despite the tax holiday on stamp duty rates, introduced in July 2020, coming to an end in England and Northern Ireland today. Stamp duty is atax paid on property purchases,external. In July 2020, the government announced a cut to help buyers whose finances were affected by Covid. Until 31 March 2021, home buyers didn't have to pay stamp duty on the first Â£500,000 of a purchase price. This meant a saving of up to Â£15,000. The government later extended the tax holiday until 30 June, and then again until 30 September. During this period home buyers didn't have to pay stamp duty on the first Â£250,000. From tomorrow, rates return to pre-Covid levels, which means the point at which buyers  start paying stamp duty will be Â£125,001. So what will happen next? Will prices continue to surge, or will demand waiver? And are soaring house prices down solely to the stamp duty cut? Here is everything you need to know as the stamp duty holiday comes to an end. As the government's furlough scheme ends, some employers may decide they can't afford to keep paying all their staff. What are your rights if you're made redundant? It's important to remember that being made redundant is not the same as getting the sack. If you are made redundant, you have a number of legal rights. Rules of fairness apply - and most employees will be entitled to a period of notice and redundancy pay. You may also be entitled to benefits while you are searching for a new job.

The film was due for release in April 2020 but had itsworld premiere last night. Naomie Harris, who is playing Moneypenny for the third time, says she is ""really hoping that it does entice people back into into cinemas and they feel comfortable doing that because it's such a special movie."" Advance ticket sales in the UK have been at levels not seen since before cinemas shut at the start of the pandemic, according to the Odeon and Cineworld chains. After seeing the film at Odeon Luxe Leicester Square cinema Henry Wheeler, 25, labelled the film as ""fantastic"".
""It was the best Bond film for a while. I enjoyed it,"" he says. ""I haven't been to the cinema in more than a year and it was good to go back."" Read more:Why cinemas will bounce back from the Coronavirus crisis The Scottish government's vaccine passport scheme could be undermined if people were able to show a negative coronavirus test result as an alternative, the Deputy First Minister says. John Swinney says the focus of the scheme is to drive up vaccination rates as much as possible. He also says he expects nightclubs and large events to start using the vaccine passport system this weekend but enforcement will not begin until 18 October. Swinney made the comments as he addressed MSPs on Holyrood's Covid-19 Committee earlier. A group of experts appearing before the committee noted that Scotland's vaccine passport scheme differs from those of other European countries in that it does not include a negative Covid test as an alternative. Swinney, the Covid Recovery Secretary, says the government will continue to consider whether testing can also be included. Here's more detail on Scotland's Covidvaccine passport scheme. The Covid-19 vaccination programme in England is estimated to have prevented 261,500 hospital admissions among people aged 45 and over, according to new figures from Public Health England. Previous estimates had put the number at 230,800 admissions. Estimates for the number of deaths prevented by vaccinations in England have also increased to 127,500, from a previous figure of 123,100. Figures show a 17.3% uptake disparity between 16 and 17 year olds in deprived and affluent areas. In Wales, 16 and 17-year-olds are far more likely to take up the offer of a Covid vaccine in more affluent parts of the country than they are in more deprived areas. Public Health Wales (PHW) figures show 61% had been given a first dose of a jab in the most deprived areas of Wales - compared to 78.3% in the least deprived areas. Healthy 16 and 17-year-olds have been eligible for a jab for six weeks and up to Tuesday night, 71.2% had received a first dose. When looking at the uptake among that age group by sex, girls are ahead at 70%, with boys at 66.4%. We've got more on the breakdown of teenage uptake in terms of gender, economic background and ethnic grouphere. Irish passport holders who live and were vaccinated in Northern Ireland can now access the EU Digital Covid Certificate. The vaccine ""passport"", which allows international travel,came into effect in the Republic of Ireland in July. Most Irish passport holders in NI were not able to access the certificate because they were vaccinated outside of the Republic. People in Northern Ireland can nowapply for the certificate online,external. The Irish Minister for Health, Stephen Donnelly, says he is""delighted"" to expand the service. Two men have denied breaching the public order act after BBC journalist Nicholas Watt was chased by protesters near Downing Street during an anti-lockdown protest. Joseph Olswang, 38, and Alexander Peat, 34, appeared at Westminster Magistrates' Court earlier, accused of using threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour with intent to cause harassment, alarm or distress on 14 June. Magistrates released Peat on unconditional bail to appear for trial on 29 November while Olswang is due to appear in the same court again later. Crowds had gathered in Westminster in June to protest against the government's extension of coronavirus restrictions in England by four weeks. Footage shared on social media showed demonstrators confronting the broadcaster near Richmond Terrace and Whitehall. The journalist, who was wearing a BBC lanyard, was forced to run through the crowd beyond a line of police officers as people shouted at him. Christopher Aitken, 62, from Brixton, and Martin Hockridge, 57, are also due to stand trial in November charged with the same offence.
They were both released on bail until the trial date. This video can not be played End of furlough: 'The scheme was a godsend' The furlough scheme, which comes to an end today, has been described as a ""godsend"" that kept businesses afloat. It was set up in March 2020 and involved the government helping to pay the wages of people who could not work due to the coronavirus pandemic. Seaneen Monaghan, a caterer, says furlough was a ""blessing"". We explained earlier how exams are going to work next year. The aim is to get GCSE and A-level grades back to pre-pandemic levels. Some measures are being introduced to deal with potential disruption Covid could cause in the coming months - but how else are pupils being helped?"" BBC News education reporter Hannah Richardson explains. Hospitality has been hit hard by the pandemic As we have been reporting, the furlough scheme comes to a close today - with an estimated one million workers still on the scheme. Many of them will have relied on furlough for a significant part of their income during the pandemic. The government stresses about half of those have been on ""flexible furlough"" at the end of the scheme, and have been working for part of the week and should have a job to return to now. But some others may be made redundant once government support is removed. So what happens next to those workers who may no longer have a job? We've heard much aboutrecord number of job vacanciesat present - but which sectors have vacancies, who is hiring - and how easy is it to transfer your skills from one field of employment to another? Find out how to maximise your potential in the job markethere. At First Minister's Questions Edinburgh Labour MSP Daniel Johnson brings up the furlough scheme, which ends today, saying there are more than 100,000 people in Scotland who are still reliant on the payments. He asks the FM if she thinks the Scottish government is doing enough to help those who find themselves out of work. Nicola Sturgeon says she will continue to do everything she can and continue to consider this on an ongoing basis and help low income families and the unemployed. She says it would be better if Scotland didn't have to go cap-in-hand to a UK government to ask for furlough to be continued. She says if Labour is serious about these issues they have to get into a position of giving the Scottish parliament the means to do what it wants to do. ""We are suffering the impact of decisions that are beyond the control of this government and this parliament and there will always be a limit to what we can do to mitigate the impact of those decisions,"" says Sturgeon.  A man taking part in the Novavax Covid vaccine trial has accused the company of ""washing their hands"" of volunteers when it comes to booster jabs. Derek Robson, 63, from Hartlepool, was vaccinated in November 2020 and is now due a booster jab but the trial site is not offering them and he is unable to access a deployed vaccine booster via the NHS. ""I now feel that I'm entering the winter months without any, or reduced, protection against Covid,"" says Derek. Novavax says it ""empathises"" with the concerns of participants in its trial and is urgently seeking guidance. Last year, volunteers,including two government ministers, signed up for trials of the Novavax vaccine being developed by the US-based company. In Januarypositive results for its UK trialwere posted, but it has not yet filed for approval and the trial remains ongoing. Participants in the trial have received letters saying Novavax ""could not provide guidance on the safety of... a booster of an approved vaccine after having previously received two doses of the Novavax vaccine... because data to support such advice does not exist"". Derek says: ""They appear to have abandoned the volunteers. ""My experience to date suggests Novavax trial volunteers cannot get any alternative vaccine as no-one wants to take any responsibility. ""It seems that both Novavax and the NHS have washed their hands of the trial volunteers."" In a statement, Novavax says it has sought ""urgent guidance"" from the NHS and the JCVI (Joint Committee on Vaccinations and Immunisations) regarding boosters, and will share any updates when available.

"Shakira (pictured in 2020) was in Barcelona, Spain, when the animals attacked Pop superstar Shakira says she was the victim of a random attack by a pair of wild boars while walking in a park in Barcelona with her eight-year-old son. The Colombian singer said the animals attacked her, before seizing her bag and retreating with it into the woods. She shared her bizarre tale in a series of Instagram stories on Wednesday. Holding the now recovered but torn bag towards the camera, she said: ""Look at how two wild boar which attacked me in the park have left my bag."" ""They were taking my bag to the woods with my mobile phone in it,"" the singer continued. ""They've destroyed everything."" She then turned to her son, whose father is the Barcelona footballer Gerard PiquÃ©, and said: ""Milan tell the truth. Say how your mummy stood up to the wild boar."" Shakira is the latest victim of the increasingly aggressive hogs which have invaded the Catalan capital in recent years. In 2016, Spanish police received 1,187 phone calls about wild hogs attacking dogs, plundering cat-feeders, holding up traffic and running into cars in the city. In 2013, one city police officer attempted to take charge of the problem himself and shot at a boar with his service revolver, but missed and hit his partner instead. Boars, which can carry a wide variety of diseases, are listed among the world's most invasive species and can survive in almost any environment. But increasingly the animals are drawn to cities, where they live off rubbish discarded by humans. Their numbers have exploded across Europe, with the latest estimates now surpassing around 10 million across the continent. As they have become more aggressive and more of a nuisance, many cities have employed a variety of strategies to cull their numbers. In Berlin, urban hunters have killed thousands of the animals but the problem persists. Last yearpolice officers in Rome sparked outrageafter they shot a family of wild boar that had wandered into a children's playground with tranquiliser darts and gave them lethal injections.

LaToya Jackson added,external: ""A huge congratulations to Britney Spears!!!"" The Britney Spears conservatorship case explained In the court hearing in Los Angeles, Judge Brenda Penny formally ended the conservatorship arrangement the star has had with her father since 2008. She left in place a separate conservatorship with John Zabel, an accountant chosen by the singer's legal team. The singer's lawyer Mathew Rosengart welcomed the court's decision Judge Penny ruled the singer's care be turned over to Mr Zabel ""forthwith"", saying it was ""in the best interest of the conservatee"". Spears' lawyers have requested a new hearing be held in the next 30 to 45 days to decide whether to end the conservatorship altogether, and Mr Rosengart added: ""Britney doesn't believe a mental evaluation is necessary, and I certainly don't."" Pandora Sykes, who hosts BBC Sounds'Pieces of Britney podcast, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme it was ""really good news"" that the conservatorship would remain in place for the time being. ""If it had been terminated... there wouldn't be any opportunity for Britney's team to gain access to Jamie's correspondence,"" she said. A recent documentary alleged,externalthat a private security film employed by Mr Spears had placed his daughter under constant surveillance. ""By suspending him they can look into all of this before they then hopefully move to terminate [the conservatorship] in November,"" Sykes continued. In her Instagram post, Spears told 'JL' - the initials of her sister Jamie-Lynn - that she was ""bringing the ship home"". Her sister used the same expressionin a recent post,externalabout the North Atlanta Knockouts, a girls' softball team. Britney Spears alongside her dad Jamie in 2006 Jamie Spears was appointed as his daughter's guardian in 2008 amid concerns over her mental health. Earlier this year, Britney Spears made explosive claims that he had abused his position, claims her father and his team have repeatedly denied. In a statement issued on Thursday, Mr Spears' lawyer said he loved his daughter ""unconditionally"" and had ""tried to do what is in her best interests"". ""These facts make the outcome of yesterday's hearing all the more disappointing, and frankly, a loss for Britney,"" continued Vivian L Thoreen. ""The court was wrong to suspend Mr Spears, put a stranger in his place to manage Britney's estate, and extend the very conservatorship that Britney begged the court to terminate earlier this summer. ""Despite the suspension, Mr Spears will continue to look out for the best interests of his daughter and work in good faith towards a positive resolution of all matters.""

He added: ""She's going to be free after everything that has been happening, all her fans and media and all the documentaries that came out really made a lot of pressure on the court to speed up the process.""

"There has been no improvement in petrol supplies at independent petrol stations since Wednesday, according to industry body the Petrol Retailers Association. The PRA, which represents independent fuel retailers, said that more than a quarter (27%) of its members' were still out of fuel on Thursday. That was better than the 37% which were out of fuel on Tuesday, but demand remained higher than usual, it said. However the AA said it saw signs that the pressure was starting to ease. The PRA, which represents nearly 5,500 of the UK's 8,300 petrol stations, said Thursday's figures were based on responses from 1,500 stations. ""Trying to calm this down appears to be a monumental task at the moment,"" said PRA chairman Brian Madderson. ""The surge in demand appears to be continuing,"" he said. ""There's been no easing off of the pressure from drivers wanting to refuel whenever they can, wherever they can."" The UK has been grappling with a fuel crisis that has caused huge queues outside some petrol stations, and forced customers to drive round multiple sites in search of supplies. While the government and industry said there was enough fuel at UK refineries, a shortage of drivers has slowed the transport of fuel to petrol stations. The government said it was seeing the ""first signs"" of demand for fuel stabilising, and stressed there was no shortage of fuel. The AA also said it saw signs that the pressure on fuel pumps was starting to ease. The motoring group said that the number of call-outs from drivers who had run out of fuel had initially increased sharply and was ""in the hundreds"" over the weekend. But it said those numbers were now falling rapidly. Although some queues remain in London, the South East and some other built-up areas, AA president Edmund King said daily improvements were now visible.

"The mental health of children and young people has not improved since last year's lockdown, a survey by NHS Digital suggests. It found one in six children in England had a probable mental disorder in 2021 - similar to 2020, and up from one in nine in 2017.

"There has been no improvement in petrol supplies at independent petrol stations since Wednesday, according to industry body the Petrol Retailers Association. The PRA, which represents independent fuel retailers, said that more than a quarter (27%) of its members' were still out of fuel on Thursday. That was better than the 37% which were out of fuel on Tuesday, but demand remained higher than usual, it said. However the AA said it saw signs that the pressure was starting to ease. The PRA, which represents nearly 5,500 of the UK's 8,300 petrol stations, said Thursday's figures were based on responses from 1,500 stations. ""Trying to calm this down appears to be a monumental task at the moment,"" said PRA chairman Brian Madderson. ""The surge in demand appears to be continuing,"" he said. ""There's been no easing off of the pressure from drivers wanting to refuel whenever they can, wherever they can."" The UK has been grappling with a fuel crisis that has caused huge queues outside some petrol stations, and forced customers to drive round multiple sites in search of supplies. While the government and industry said there was enough fuel at UK refineries, a shortage of drivers has slowed the transport of fuel to petrol stations. The government said it was seeing the ""first signs"" of demand for fuel stabilising, and stressed there was no shortage of fuel. The AA also said it saw signs that the pressure on fuel pumps was starting to ease. The motoring group said that the number of call-outs from drivers who had run out of fuel had initially increased sharply and was ""in the hundreds"" over the weekend. But it said those numbers were now falling rapidly. Although some queues remain in London, the South East and some other built-up areas, AA president Edmund King said daily improvements were now visible.

"This video can not be played Greta Thunberg mocked the ''empty words and promises'' of world leaders as ""blah, blah, blah"" With the jeers of Greta Thunberg ringing in their ears, climate ministers are holding final talks before a key UN conference in Glasgow. The Swedish activist criticised the efforts of politicians to tackle climate change as ""30 years of blah, blah, blah"". But despite the mockery, ministers say some progress is being made on a range of issues. The meeting in Italy's financial capital Milan lasts until Saturday. The global climate summit explained Whisper it cautiously... progress this week on climate Australia PM may skip COP26 climate summit Earlier this week Greta Thunberg lambasted the efforts of political leaders at a youth climate summit. She was one of 400 young people who came to Milan to formulate a response to rising temperatures that will be presented to ministers here on Thursday. Ms Thunberg will also meet Italy's prime minister Mario Draghi. Officials believe that despite the criticism about the slow pace of progress, the wheels are beginning to move on a number of fronts. Last week at the UN General Assembly,announcements from Chinaand the US on coal and climate finance, helped improve the prospects for the upcoming UN conference, known as COP26. Negotiators meeting at this ""pre-COP"" event are under pressure to clear the way for their bosses, the world's presidents and prime ministers who will meet in Glasgow at the start of COP26 in early November. One of the big issues holding up progress is the question of money. Despite significant new promises, the wealthy nations are still around $20bn short of the long-promised $100bn a year that's meant to help poorer countries cope with rising temperatures. Curbing deforestation is critical to keeping temperatures under 1.5C ""Isn't it ridiculous, that in the midst of a trillion dollar emergency response economy that we're seeing right now, we are haggling over a $20bn price tag to essentially unleash hundreds of billions of dollars, if not trillions of dollars of developing country investments,"" said the head ofUNDP,externalAchim Steiner. Mr Steiner is a senior leader in the UN and has been a close observer of the climate talks process for many years. ""Time is running out, and we can't find a way in which we can finance this? It's just not acceptable,"" he told BBC News. While ministers will look to make progress on cash and other outstanding questions in their discussions here over the next few days, they will be heartened by new research showing that the 1.5C temperature threshold can be kept in sight at a relatively low cost over the next decade. Methane from agriculture is a major problem but also presents an opportunity Thereport comes from the Energy Transitions Commission,external, a group made up of leaders from the energy industry, finance and climate advocacy. They outline six actions that could be taken by companies and countries which would go beyond the carbon cutting plans and would limit warming to 1.5C. The key steps include: Significant and rapid cuts in methane emissions: Low cost actions could cut fossil fuel related emissions by 60% by 2030, and methane from agriculture and waste management by 30%. Decarbonising the power sector and accelerating the phase out of coal: An immediate ban on the construction of new coal fired plants combined with a phase out of existing sources, could cut 3.5bn tonnes of CO2 by 2030. Accelerating the electrification of road transport: The report envisages a ban on selling internal combustion engines by 2035. Accelerating supply decarbonisation in buildings, heavy industry and transport: Commitments by leading companies and countries in steel, cement, shipping and aviation could deliver an additional one billion tonnes of emissions reductions every year. Reinvigorating energy and resource efficiency: Improvements in energy efficiency have stalled and could be accelerated by decisions and action at COP26. Halting deforestation and beginning reforestation: This will require significant financial support from rich developed countries and should be a priority for climate finance. ""The 1.5C threshold is absolutely technologically possible at costs which the global economy could easily absorb,"" said Adair Turner, the chair of the Energy Transitions Commission. ""We broadly know the categories of what is possible. We have provided, we think, a robust quantification of what's possible. And there are specific initiatives which could be taken in addition to country's carbon cutting plans, which would get us there."" ""And we need them because we're running out of time.""

"Traffic app Waze is asking UK users to tell it which petrol stations have fuel available, amid the UK's shortage of petrol at the pump. Users of the app are receiving push notifications asking them to ""help your community stay informed"". This data is then plugged into the app's live map for others to see which stations are open. Similar measures have been criticised as fuelling panic buying and adding to the problem. Many local Facebook groups and apps such as Nextdoor have been flooded in recent days with messages from people offering advice about which petrol stations have fuel. Waze, a subsidiary of Google, said the feature to show fuel stocks was not new but the company ""has made the decision to push 'notify users' to encourage its use"". ""Fears of disruption to fuel supply have created bumper-to-bumper traffic at petrol stations,"" Waze UK manager Ru Roberts said. ""In some areas, speeds have slowed to as low as 3km/h (1.9mph) as drivers rushed to fill their cars."" The push notifications ""will enable motorists to guide others to forecourts which have remaining supplies, saving unnecessary journeys to those which have already run out,"" he said. The government maintains there is no national fuel shortage - and any regional issues are fuelled by extreme demand. Earlier this week, Brian Madderson, who chairs the Petrol Retailers' Association, told BBC News: ""One of the reasons for this is social media. ""As soon as a tanker arrives at a filling station, people on social media are advising that a tanker has arrived and then it's like bees to a honey pot. ""Everyone flocks thereâ¦ within a few hours, it is out again."" Fuel crisis starting to ease, Johnson says Is the petrol shortage improving? Why is there an HGV driver shortage? Waze's app is most often used to crowdsource live traffic data, so it can tell users about sudden road closures and traffic jams. But now its data showed which areas of major population centres had the worst traffic around fuel stations, the company said. For example: On Wednesday lunchtime in Liverpool, traffic at Hunter Street headed towards a BP petrol station on New Islington Road had had an average speed of just 5mph At the same time in London, one of the worst traffic jams had been on Park Lane, in Mayfair, heading towards the Esso station, where traffic had slowed to 7.5mph Its internal data also showed in some areas - such as Liverpool, Luton, and Manchester - the distance driven had actually increased on some days, in part due to people searching for petrol.

""There's been no easing off of the pressure from drivers wanting to refuel whenever they can, wherever they can."" The UK has been grappling with a fuel crisis that has caused huge queues outside some petrol stations, and forced customers to drive round multiple sites in search of supplies. While the government and industry said there was enough fuel at UK refineries, a shortage of drivers has slowed the transport of fuel to petrol stations. The government said it was seeing the ""first signs"" of demand for fuel stabilising, and stressed there was no shortage of fuel. The AA also said it saw signs that the pressure on fuel pumps was starting to ease. The motoring group said that the number of call-outs from drivers who had run out of fuel had initially increased sharply and was ""in the hundreds"" over the weekend. But it said those numbers were now falling rapidly. Although some queues remain in London, the South East and some other built-up areas, AA president Edmund King said daily improvements were now visible. ""We believe we have turned the corner,"" he said. The PRA told the BBC that it had also received ""anecdotal"" evidence that the problems were more acute in London and the South East. It said that Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales appeared to be ""mostly ok"". The PRA's Mr Madderson said he had written to the government this morning to warn them that the price of petrol and diesel at the pump was likely to rise, after a rise in the price of Brent Crude oil. A fall in the value of the pound against the dollar would also push up prices for UK customers, he said. ""Those two [factors] have already started to impinge on wholesale prices, which have gone up - in the last three nights - by nearly 3p a litre,"" he said. Petrol shortage: Is the fuel crisis improving? Petrol supply: Army put on standby to ease fuel crisis Government plans to use the army to address some of the delivery problems in the coming days would help to ease the problems, Mr Madderson said, but the main thing that was required was a change in public behaviour. ""Let's just try and calm it down please,"" he said. He said he understood that the army could be helping with deliveries by the weekend. The majority of sites completely out of stock were BP franchisees, Mr Madderson said, adding the PRA was talking to BP about the issues they were facing. BP told the BBC it was ""working flat out to keep our petrol stations stocked and restock them when they run out"". Some of the government's reserve tanker fleet is stationed in Fenstanton, Cambridgeshire Long queues and frustrated customers have led to multiple reports on social media of abuse of service station staff. BBC broadcast engineerSimon Hardwick tweeted,external: ""Chatting with a member of staff at a supermarket petrol station, who said they are getting deliveries but within a few hours they sell out again. He also mentioned the abuse he's been receiving from members of the public."" Industry leaders have condemned physical and verbal abuse suffered by service station employees during the crisis. Gordon Balmer, the executive director of the PRA, said the abuse was ""completely unacceptable"". ""It is important to remember that fuel stocks remain normal at refineries and terminals, and deliveries have been reduced solely due to the shortage of HGV drivers"", he added. The haulage industry said an existing shortage of lorry drivers had been made worse by a number of factors, including the pandemic, Brexit, an ageing workforce, and low wages and poor working conditions. In an attempt to limit disruption,the government has confirmedthat 5,000 fuel tanker and food lorry drivers can receive temporary UK visas, with the scheme ending on Christmas Eve. The Road Haulage Association said, however, the recent move ""barely scratches the surface"", adding that only offering visas until Christmas Eve ""will not be enough for companies or the drivers themselves to be attractive"". A spokesman for the government said it had taken ""immediate action"" to increase the numbers of HGV drivers. ""We recognise the challenges facing industry and streamlined the testing process in July to boost the number of drivers,"" he added. Meanwhile, petrol station group EG said its workers would get a 5% pay rise for ""heroic"" work since the start of the Covid pandemic. The wage increase takes the minimum rate for over-18s to Â£9.50 per hour at EG Group, which was founded by the Asda-owning Issa brothers. Mohsin and Zuber Issa, the billionaire co-founders and co-chief executives of the group, said: ""Our colleagues have pulled out all the stops and been nothing short of heroic during often very difficult times since the start of the pandemic. ""It is due to their hard work and dedication that EG has continued to be a growth business, performing strongly over the past 12 months. ""We are grateful to each and every one of them for their contributions and are therefore making a total reward package available to them which we believe is among the best in the country."" EG Group was founded in 2001 and has more than 45,000 staff working in more than 6,200 sites in Europe, the US and Australia. Is the fuel crisis improving?

"This video can not be played Relatives waited for news after police stormed the jail in Guayaquil where a deadly riot took place Desperate families have gathered at a jail in Ecuador which police are trying to bring under control after fighting left at least 118 inmates dead. The battle first broke out on Tuesday, with prisoners using explosives and firearms on each other. Families are seeking news on loved ones but with some victims decapitated or dismembered, identifying the bodies could take days. The gang-related violence is the worst in Ecuador's history. What is happening inside the Guayas prison complex, also known as the Litoral Penitentiary, is unclear. Officials said on Wednesday the jail was back under their control, but early on Thursday neighbours said they had heard explosions and gunshots. Late on Thursday, police regained control of the prison following a major operation involving 900 officers and army soldiers. the authorities said. Police commander Tannya Varela told Reuters the death toll could rise further as security forces work their way through the jail. ""We have not yet completed the intervention in the penitentiary, so it is possible that there are other bodies inside, and some of the injured could die from their wounds,"" she said. The fight first broke out on Tuesday when inmates from one wing of the prison crawled through a hole to gain access to a different wing, where they attacked rival gang members. Inmates climbed onto the roof of the Litoral prison as a deadly fight unfolded Police managed to get six cooks, who were trapped in the wing where the fight happened, to safety and only two police officers were injured. Ecuador's prison director, BolÃ­var GarzÃ³n, said that police had entered the prison on Tuesday and found 24 bodies. According to Mr GarzÃ³n, there was renewed shooting inside the prison overnight Tuesday into Wednesday and as police went through the prison wings one by one, they found scores more bodies, bringing the death toll to 116. With security forces inside and outside of the jail, families of inmates face an anxious wait. Some of the relatives said they had been sent photos and video from inside the prison but had been given no official confirmation as to whether their family member was among the victims. Newspaper El Comercio reported that one woman had recognised her husband in one of the videos. She said he was one of those who had been decapitated. By Blanca Moncada Pesantes, Guayaquil When Ecuador's President Guillermo Lasso announced that the death toll had risen to 116 from the initial 24, dozens of families rushed to the forensic laboratory where the bodies of the victims are being taken. They want to find out where their loved ones are and if they are still alive. They have yet to get an answer and their anxiety only increased as explosions could again be heard coming from Guayaquil's biggest prison, a sign that the gang war inside - said to be linked to the drugs trade - had not been brought under control. Among them is Zenaida Moreira, 50, whose 23-year-old son was sent to the prison two years ago for stealing chairs from a school. Ms Moreira fears the worst after having seen videos of the carnage inside the jail. ""I don't know if one of the bodies I saw was his. I saw a decapitated head, the face is similar to his, but the authorities are not saying anything."" Read full story here The fact that only two police officers have been injured but more than 100 inmates killed strongly suggests this is a war among inmates rather than an attempt at a prison uprising. Local media are reporting that the brutal killings could have been ordered from outside the prison mirroring a power struggle between Mexican cartels currently under way in Ecuador. The Litoral Penitentiary holds inmates from Los Choneros, an Ecuadorean gang which is thought to have links with Mexico's powerful Sinaloa drugs cartel. The prison houses members of rival gangs with links to Mexican drug cartels But another Mexican criminal group, the Jalisco New Generation cartel (CJNG), is also trying to forge alliances with Ecuadorean gangs to seize control of drug smuggling routes leading from Ecuador to Central America from its Sinaloa rivals. The decapitations and the brutal nature of the violence seen inside the Litoral prison are hallmarks of the Mexican cartels, which often kill their rivals in the most gruesome ways to spread further terror. This most recent prison fight is the deadliest in the history of Ecuador's prison system but there have been a number of brutal confrontations in the past year. In February, 79 prisoners were killed in simultaneous fights at four jails, one of them Litoral Penitentiary. Ecuador is a transit country for cocaine smuggled from neighbouring Peru and Colombia, and the powerful Mexican drug cartels are said to operate through local gangs. Inside jails there are problems with overcrowding and a shortage of guards. Police are often met with prisoners who are heavily armed. After the latest incident, President Lasso declared a state of emergency in the prison system, which allows officials to suspend certain rights and use the military to regain control. He also said support would be provided to inmates' relatives.

"Britney Spears said she is ""bringing the ship home"" Britney Spears has said she is ""on cloud nine right now"", in what appears to be a response to a judgesuspending her father as her conservator. The singer posted a video of her having a flying lesson, shortly after news that Jamie Spears' role was suspended. Spears' lawyerMathew Rosengart said,externalit was his ""hope and expectation"" the conservatorship would be fully terminated at a hearing on 12 November. Through his own lawyer, Jamie Spears called the ruling ""disappointing"". Cher and Dionne Warwick were among those welcoming the judge's decision. Allow Instagram content?

LaToya Jackson added,external: ""A huge congratulations to Britney Spears!!!"" The Britney Spears conservatorship case explained In the court hearing in Los Angeles, Judge Brenda Penny formally ended the conservatorship arrangement the star has had with her father since 2008. She left in place a separate conservatorship with John Zabel, an accountant chosen by the singer's legal team. The singer's lawyer Mathew Rosengart welcomed the court's decision Judge Penny ruled the singer's care be turned over to Mr Zabel ""forthwith"", saying it was ""in the best interest of the conservatee"". Spears' lawyers have requested a new hearing be held in the next 30 to 45 days to decide whether to end the conservatorship altogether, and Mr Rosengart added: ""Britney doesn't believe a mental evaluation is necessary, and I certainly don't."" Pandora Sykes, who hosts BBC Sounds'Pieces of Britney podcast, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme it was ""really good news"" that the conservatorship would remain in place for the time being. ""If it had been terminated... there wouldn't be any opportunity for Britney's team to gain access to Jamie's correspondence,"" she said. A recent documentary alleged,externalthat a private security film employed by Mr Spears had placed his daughter under constant surveillance. ""By suspending him they can look into all of this before they then hopefully move to terminate [the conservatorship] in November,"" Sykes continued. In her Instagram post, Spears told 'JL' - the initials of her sister Jamie-Lynn - that she was ""bringing the ship home"". Her sister used the same expressionin a recent post,externalabout the North Atlanta Knockouts, a girls' softball team. Britney Spears alongside her dad Jamie in 2006 Jamie Spears was appointed as his daughter's guardian in 2008 amid concerns over her mental health. Earlier this year, Britney Spears made explosive claims that he had abused his position, claims her father and his team have repeatedly denied. In a statement issued on Thursday, Mr Spears' lawyer said he loved his daughter ""unconditionally"" and had ""tried to do what is in her best interests"". ""These facts make the outcome of yesterday's hearing all the more disappointing, and frankly, a loss for Britney,"" continued Vivian L Thoreen. ""The court was wrong to suspend Mr Spears, put a stranger in his place to manage Britney's estate, and extend the very conservatorship that Britney begged the court to terminate earlier this summer. ""Despite the suspension, Mr Spears will continue to look out for the best interests of his daughter and work in good faith towards a positive resolution of all matters."" Fans around the world who have supported Spears through the #FreeBritney campaign have expressed much delight about this week's developments. A rally was held outside the court on Wednesday, while fans also gathered in London's Trafalgar Square.

He added: ""She's going to be free after everything that has been happening, all her fans and media and all the documentaries that came out really made a lot of pressure on the court to speed up the process.""

"Exam results rose for two years in a row GCSE and A-level grades in England will be returned to pre-Covid levels over the next two years, the government has announced. Next summer's results will be wound back to a ""mid-point"" between 2019 and 2021, after two years of unusually high grade inflation. Ministers say exams will happen but the option of teacher-assessed grades will be kept in reserve. Pupils will get notice of exam topics in some subjects to aid revision. And there will be a choice of questions in some arts subjects, as well as materials such as formulae for maths and science subjects. These modifications aim to protect pupils against lost learning due to the Covid pandemic. Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi says he is putting ""fairness at the heart"" of his plans for exams in 2022 and the year after. Last summer, exams were cancelled for the second year in a row due to the pandemic, and grades were again awarded by teachers. Pupils to get advance notice of exam topics in 2022 Exams altered next year after pandemic disruption Record GCSE results after second year of no exams This led to the proportion of pupils passing and scoring higher grades rising significantly for the second year in a row. Between 2019 and 2021, the proportion of GCSEs, for example, awarded the top grades 7 to 9, rose nearly 12 percentage points to 28.9%. Usually the share of grades is held steady, by a system of comparable outcomes designed to maintain standards from one year to the next. Exam boards use statistics and predictions to maintain fairness in the system. Chief regulator Dr Jo Saxton said: ""As we return to summer exams, in 2022 exam boards will set the grade boundaries based on a profile that reflects a mid-point between 2021 and pre-pandemic grading. ""This will provide a safety net for students, to reflect the disruption this cohort have experienced already in their course and recognising the fact that, because of the pandemic, most A-level students won't have taken public exams before. ""Our aim is to return to a pre-pandemic grade profile. ""But we don't think it would be fair on 2022's students to do it all in one go, given the disruption they have experienced. We will aim, therefore, to return in broadly two steps."" Dr Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said: ""The government and Ofqual are picking an arbitrary number out of the air in order to determine how many of each grade will be issued next summer. ""Such a random act undermines their argument that exams are the fairest way to assess students. ""Whilst last summer's system wasn't perfect, the grades at least were a reflection of what students themselves had done, rather than simply reflecting how much better or worse they were than their peers,"" she said. Ministers also confirmed a set of adaptations to exams including a choice of questions in English Literature, history, ancient history and geography. Teachers will also get information on the focus of exam content so they can guide students on what to revise - but not until February. Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, called for information on exam content to be shared earlier. ""It would also enable teachers to do the very best for each of their students, ensuring they cover as much of the specification as possible, and that they are well prepared for the exams and assessments,"" he said. But Ian Bauckham, interim chairman of exams watchdog Ofqual, said that if exam topics were announced too early it could discourage students from covering as much content as possible. Giving three to four months notice was ""the right balance to strike"", he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Mr Zahawiâ¯said: ""We are committed to rigorous standards being fairly applied, and exams are the fairest way to assess students, which is why they will take place next year.""

"The body of Sarah Everard was found hidden in woodland Sarah Everard was a ""wholly blameless victim of a grotesque series of circumstances"", a judge has said. Wayne Couzens, a Met Police officer, strangled Ms Everard with his police belt after kidnapping her during a false arrest. Couzens showed his warrant card before restraining the 33-year-old, putting her in his hire car and driving away. Lord Justice Fulford said he had ""no doubt Couzens used his position as a police officer to coerce her into car"". Ahead of sentencing Couzens,external, the judge said the circumstances of the case were ""devastating, tragic and wholly brutal"". The evidence gathered against him was ""unanswerable"" and there was ""no credible innocent explanation"" for it, he said. In full: Sarah Everard's family on their loss Sarah Everard: Daughter, sister, friend and colleague The judge added that Couzens went ""hunting a lone female to kidnap and rape"" having planned his actions in ""unspeakably"" grim detail. The defendant's preparations included taking some of his police kit with him and lying to his family about working on the night of the murder, he said. This video can not be played A CCTV timeline shows key evidence used to arrest and prosecute Wayne Couzens Prosecutor Tom Little QC previously suggested the case was so exceptional and unprecedented that it could warrant a whole life order, meaning Couzens would die in jail. During mitigation earlier, defence barrister Jim Sturman QC said his client was filled with ""self-loathing"". He told the Old Bailey that nothing he said was intended to minimise the ""horror"" of what Couzens did that night and after, but he argued against a whole-life order. ""He accepts he will receive and deserves severe punishment,"" Mr Sturman said, ""No right-minded person... can feel anything other than revulsion for what he did."" The barrister claimed that Couzens should not be sentenced to a whole-life order on three grounds: his guilty pleas, underlying depression and that he has no previous convictions for violence. Ms Everard's family was in court for Couzens' guilty plea Ms Everard's family previously said therecan be ""no redemption for what he had done"". The defendant was not able to look at the family during the hearing. Mr Sturman added: ""He is ashamed. What he has done is terrible and he deserves a very lengthy finite term. ""But he did all he could after he was arrested to minimise the wicked harm that he did."" Lucy Manning, BBC special correspondent, from the Old Bailey: Wayne Couzens walked into the dock, bent over, again looking down at the floor. After the emotion of Wednesday when he was made to look up and face the Everard family as they described the impact of losing Sarah, he will find out today if he will spend the rest of his life in jail. The Everard family are in court to hear what sentence he will receive. As Couzens' barrister told the court that the policeman doesn't seek to make excuses for anything that he'd done and he is filled with self loathing and abject shame, Sarah Everard's mother stared at her daughter's murderer. He never looked up. As they said yesterday, all they want is Sarah back and no punishment he receives will ever compare to the pain and torture Couzens inflicted on them.

"Sarah Everard was a talented and much-loved young woman, Lord Justice Fulford said A Met Police officer who murdered Sarah Everard after kidnapping her under the guise of an arrest has been sentenced to a whole-life prison term. Wayne Couzens abducted the 33-year-old as she walked home from a friend's house in south London on 3 March. During the sentencing of Couzens, the judge said the case was ""devastating, tragic and wholly brutal"". Ms Everard's family said they were relieved by the fact that Couzens would die in jail. Addressing reporters outside the Old Bailey following his sentencing, Metropolitan Police Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick said she recognised that a ""precious bond of trust"" had been damaged by Couzens,who had ""brought shame on the Met"". Describing him as a ""coward"", she said his crimes were ""a gross betrayal of everything policing stands for"", adding: ""I am so sorry."" This video can not be played Metropolitan Police Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick says the force has been ""shamed"" and ""rocked"" by the case An ongoingIndependent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) reviewof how Couzens became a Met officer has found that vetting procedures missed that two of his previous cars had been linked to allegations of indecent exposure. Speaking to the London Assembly's Police and Crime Committee earlier on Thursday, two senior Met officers said they were not aware of rumours that Couzens was nicknamed ""the rapist"" by colleagues. However, HM Chief Inspector of Constabulary Sir Tom Winsor said the nickname was known by some officers. Sir Tom, who in his role has responsibility for the inspection of police forces, told BBC Radio 4's the World at One: ""Yes, I did know that. And he also had allegedly a reputation in terms of drug abuse, extreme pornography and other offences of this kind."" What Couzens' colleagues knew or suspected about him remains the subject of the IOPC investigation. Trust in police shaken by Everard case - Met chief Sarah Everard: Daughter, sister, friend and colleague How a police officer covered up Sarah Everard's murder When sentencing Couzens earlier on Thursday, Lord Justice Fulford described the circumstances of the kidnap, rape and murder as ""grotesque"", telling him he had ""betrayed"" his family. He said Ms Everard was ""an intelligent, resourceful, talented and much-loved young woman, still in the early years of her life"". The judge told 48-year-old Couzens: ""Notwithstanding your guilty pleas, therefore, I have seen no evidence of genuine contrition on your part, as opposed to evident self-pity and attempts by you to avoid or minimise the proper consequences of what you have done."" He said the seriousness of the case was so ""exceptionally high"" that it warranted a whole-life order. ""The misuse of a police officer's role such as occurred in this case in order to kidnap, rape and murder a lone victim is of equal seriousness as a murder for the purpose of advancing a political, religious or ideological cause,"" he told the Old Bailey. ""All of these situations attack different aspects of the fundamental underpinnings of our democratic way of life."" This video can not be played A CCTV timeline shows key evidence used to arrest and prosecute Wayne Couzens Reacting to the sentencing, Ms Everard's family said they were pleased with the full-life term, adding that although ""nothing can make things better, nothing can bring Sarah back... knowing he will be imprisoned forever brings some relief. ""Sarah lost her life needlessly and cruelly and all the years of life she had yet to enjoy were stolen from her. Wayne Couzens held a position of trust as a police officer and we are outraged and sickened that he abused this trust in order to lure Sarah to her death. The world is a safer place with him imprisoned. ""It is almost seven months since Sarah died and the pain of losing her is overwhelming. We miss her all the time. We hold her safe in our hearts."" Lucy Manning, BBC special correspondent, from the Old Bailey: Lord Justice Fulford called Couzens ""warped, selfish and brutal"" As Wayne Couzens was told he would spend the rest of his life in prison, he kept his head down as he has throughout his time in the dock. He was shaking as he was sentenced. The Everard family looked on. The Metropolitan Police Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick was in court to hear the sentence. Her officer a convicted murderer and rapist. Mr Justice Fulford told Couzens his offences were ""warped, selfish and brutal"". The judge said Sarah ""was simply walking home"". After Couzens was sentenced, police officers who investigated the murder hugged the Everard family. But as her parents and sister said yesterday, all they want is Sarah back and no punishment will ever compare to the pain and torture Couzens had inflicted on them. Lord Justice Fulford paid tribute to the dignity of Ms Everard's family, whose statements in court on Wednesday ""revealed the human impact"" of Couzens' offending, which he said ""was both sexual and homicidal"". The judge added that Couzenshad eroded public confidence,externalin the police in England and Wales. In full: Sarah Everard's family on their loss Does following the 'rules' keep women safe? Met chief should quit over Everard case - Harman In a letter she wrote before Dame Cressida spoke to reporters, senior Labour MP Harriet Harman called on the Met Police commissioner to resign. Ms Harman saidwomen's confidence in the police ""will have been shattered"",externaland it would be impossible for Dame Cressida to oversee the changes needed to rebuild trust. Home Secretary Priti Patel said there were ""serious questions"" for the Metropolitan Police regarding the Couzens case, adding that the force ""will be held to account"". She described the crimes as ""sickening"" and said it was right that this ""monster"" had been given a whole-life sentence. When Parliament abolished the death penalty more than 50 years ago, it promised the British people that the worst of the very worst offenders would be locked up in jail for the rest of their lives. Since then a series of complex rules for judges has evolved in order for a ""whole-life order"" (WLO) to be imposed. The law says a WLO should ""normally"" only be considered if an offender has murdered more than once, killed a police or prison officer, abducted and sadistically killed a child, or where the motive was ideological. While MPs did not envisage such a serious crime as this when they wrote the law, they said judges could impose a WLO in other unthinkable cases where the seriousness of the crime was exceptionally high. Lord Justice Fulford concluded the misuse of a constable's role to deceive, kidnap, rape and murder Sarah Everard was as bad as terrorism. It was not only a crime of appalling and prolonged suffering for the victim, but it undermined trust in the police - part of the bedrock of a safe society. And that is why the law allowed the judge to order Couzens will never be released. The Old Bailey sentencing hearing had been told how Couzens used his Metropolitan Police-issue warrant card and handcuffs to abduct Ms Everard as she walked from Clapham to her Brixton home on the night of 3 March. The firearms-trained parliamentary and diplomatic protection officer, who had clocked off from a 12-hour shift at the US Embassy that morning, drove to a secluded rural area near Dover where he raped Ms Everard. She had been strangled with Couzens' police-issue belt by 02:30 GMT the following morning. Couzens, who was married with two children, then burned the marketing executive's body in a refrigerator in an area of woodland he owned in Hoads Wood, near Ashford, before dumping the remains in a nearby pond. On 9 March, he was arrested at his home in Deal, Kent, after police connected him to the hire car he used to abduct Ms Everard. Her remains were found by police dogs the next day. Wayne Couzens admitted murder, kidnap and rape Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he was ""sickened"" by the details that had emerged during sentencing. ""Our police are there to protect us - and I know that officers will share in our shock and devastation at the total betrayal of this duty. People must be able to walk on our streets without fear of harm and with full confidence that the police are there to keep them safe."" John Apter, national chair of the Police Federation of England and Wales, said Couzens was ""an absolute disgrace to the police service"" and he was ""ashamed he was ever a police officer"". ""I am proud to carry a warrant card, but this vile individual's abuse of that authority has cast a shadow on all those who work within policing. He has brought disgrace to our uniform. ""The way he took advantage of Sarah's trust makes me feel sick to the stomach.""

"This video can not be played Relatives waited for news after police stormed the jail in Guayaquil where a deadly riot took place Desperate families have gathered at a jail in Ecuador which police are trying to bring under control after fighting left at least 118 inmates dead. The battle first broke out on Tuesday, with prisoners using explosives and firearms on each other. Families are seeking news on loved ones but with some victims decapitated or dismembered, identifying the bodies could take days. The gang-related violence is the worst in Ecuador's history. What is happening inside the Guayas prison complex, also known as the Litoral Penitentiary, is unclear. Officials said on Wednesday the jail was back under their control, but early on Thursday neighbours said they had heard explosions and gunshots. Late on Thursday, police regained control of the prison following a major operation involving 900 officers and army soldiers. the authorities said. Police commander Tannya Varela told Reuters the death toll could rise further as security forces work their way through the jail. ""We have not yet completed the intervention in the penitentiary, so it is possible that there are other bodies inside, and some of the injured could die from their wounds,"" she said. The fight first broke out on Tuesday when inmates from one wing of the prison crawled through a hole to gain access to a different wing, where they attacked rival gang members. Inmates climbed onto the roof of the Litoral prison as a deadly fight unfolded Police managed to get six cooks, who were trapped in the wing where the fight happened, to safety and only two police officers were injured. Ecuador's prison director, BolÃ­var GarzÃ³n, said that police had entered the prison on Tuesday and found 24 bodies. According to Mr GarzÃ³n, there was renewed shooting inside the prison overnight Tuesday into Wednesday and as police went through the prison wings one by one, they found scores more bodies, bringing the death toll to 116. With security forces inside and outside of the jail, families of inmates face an anxious wait. Some of the relatives said they had been sent photos and video from inside the prison but had been given no official confirmation as to whether their family member was among the victims. Newspaper El Comercio reported that one woman had recognised her husband in one of the videos. She said he was one of those who had been decapitated. By Blanca Moncada Pesantes, Guayaquil When Ecuador's President Guillermo Lasso announced that the death toll had risen to 116 from the initial 24, dozens of families rushed to the forensic laboratory where the bodies of the victims are being taken. They want to find out where their loved ones are and if they are still alive. They have yet to get an answer and their anxiety only increased as explosions could again be heard coming from Guayaquil's biggest prison, a sign that the gang war inside - said to be linked to the drugs trade - had not been brought under control. Among them is Zenaida Moreira, 50, whose 23-year-old son was sent to the prison two years ago for stealing chairs from a school. Ms Moreira fears the worst after having seen videos of the carnage inside the jail. ""I don't know if one of the bodies I saw was his. I saw a decapitated head, the face is similar to his, but the authorities are not saying anything."" Read full story here The fact that only two police officers have been injured but more than 100 inmates killed strongly suggests this is a war among inmates rather than an attempt at a prison uprising. Local media are reporting that the brutal killings could have been ordered from outside the prison mirroring a power struggle between Mexican cartels currently under way in Ecuador. The Litoral Penitentiary holds inmates from Los Choneros, an Ecuadorean gang which is thought to have links with Mexico's powerful Sinaloa drugs cartel. The prison houses members of rival gangs with links to Mexican drug cartels But another Mexican criminal group, the Jalisco New Generation cartel (CJNG), is also trying to forge alliances with Ecuadorean gangs to seize control of drug smuggling routes leading from Ecuador to Central America from its Sinaloa rivals. The decapitations and the brutal nature of the violence seen inside the Litoral prison are hallmarks of the Mexican cartels, which often kill their rivals in the most gruesome ways to spread further terror. This most recent prison fight is the deadliest in the history of Ecuador's prison system but there have been a number of brutal confrontations in the past year. In February, 79 prisoners were killed in simultaneous fights at four jails, one of them Litoral Penitentiary. Ecuador is a transit country for cocaine smuggled from neighbouring Peru and Colombia, and the powerful Mexican drug cartels are said to operate through local gangs. Inside jails there are problems with overcrowding and a shortage of guards. Police are often met with prisoners who are heavily armed. After the latest incident, President Lasso declared a state of emergency in the prison system, which allows officials to suspend certain rights and use the military to regain control. He also said support would be provided to inmates' relatives.

"The body of Sarah Everard was found hidden in woodland Sarah Everard was a ""wholly blameless victim of a grotesque series of circumstances"", a judge has said. Wayne Couzens, a Met Police officer, strangled Ms Everard with his police belt after kidnapping her during a false arrest. Couzens showed his warrant card before restraining the 33-year-old, putting her in his hire car and driving away. Lord Justice Fulford said he had ""no doubt Couzens used his position as a police officer to coerce her into car"". Ahead of sentencing Couzens,external, the judge said the circumstances of the case were ""devastating, tragic and wholly brutal"". The evidence gathered against him was ""unanswerable"" and there was ""no credible innocent explanation"" for it, he said. In full: Sarah Everard's family on their loss Sarah Everard: Daughter, sister, friend and colleague The judge added that Couzens went ""hunting a lone female to kidnap and rape"" having planned his actions in ""unspeakably"" grim detail. The defendant's preparations included taking some of his police kit with him and lying to his family about working on the night of the murder, he said. This video can not be played A CCTV timeline shows key evidence used to arrest and prosecute Wayne Couzens Prosecutor Tom Little QC previously suggested the case was so exceptional and unprecedented that it could warrant a whole life order, meaning Couzens would die in jail. During mitigation earlier, defence barrister Jim Sturman QC said his client was filled with ""self-loathing"". He told the Old Bailey that nothing he said was intended to minimise the ""horror"" of what Couzens did that night and after, but he argued against a whole-life order. ""He accepts he will receive and deserves severe punishment,"" Mr Sturman said, ""No right-minded person... can feel anything other than revulsion for what he did."" The barrister claimed that Couzens should not be sentenced to a whole-life order on three grounds: his guilty pleas, underlying depression and that he has no previous convictions for violence. Ms Everard's family was in court for Couzens' guilty plea Ms Everard's family previously said therecan be ""no redemption for what he had done"". The defendant was not able to look at the family during the hearing. Mr Sturman added: ""He is ashamed. What he has done is terrible and he deserves a very lengthy finite term. ""But he did all he could after he was arrested to minimise the wicked harm that he did."" Lucy Manning, BBC special correspondent, from the Old Bailey: Wayne Couzens walked into the dock, bent over, again looking down at the floor. After the emotion of Wednesday when he was made to look up and face the Everard family as they described the impact of losing Sarah, he will find out today if he will spend the rest of his life in jail. The Everard family are in court to hear what sentence he will receive. As Couzens' barrister told the court that the policeman doesn't seek to make excuses for anything that he'd done and he is filled with self loathing and abject shame, Sarah Everard's mother stared at her daughter's murderer. He never looked up. As they said yesterday, all they want is Sarah back and no punishment he receives will ever compare to the pain and torture Couzens inflicted on them.

"The furlough scheme closes on Thursday, with uncertainty ahead for people who have not yet fully returned to work. Nearly one million workers were expected to be on the scheme at the end of September, according to research by the Resolution Foundation. Of those on furlough in late July, about half on the scheme were able to work some of the time, the HMRC says. Since the start of the pandemic, it has helped paythe wages of 11.6 million workers,external. But many forecasters, including the Bank of England, are expecting a small rise in unemployment as it ends. The chancellor said he was ""immensely proud"" of the near Â£70bn scheme, but now was the right time to close it, despite calls for further support from some badly-hit companies. What will happen when furlough ends? What impact has the furlough scheme had? The travel sector has suffered more than most during the pandemic, with businesses being affected by changing restrictions and lower consumer confidence. Mark Andrew, the director of Animal Aircare, which helps pets travel overseas via Gatwick Airport, said some of his staff may be made redundant if business does not improve. The firm has not yet had to lay off staff, which Mr Andrew said was ""purely down to furlough"". Animal Aircare staff help pets travel overseas via Gatwick Airport ""Furlough ending means there's a real question mark for our business. We're still waiting for Gatwick to pick up... it seems the airline industry is not buoyant enough yet,"" he said. Although the end of the scheme comes amida record number of job vacancies, Fidelity International's investment director, Maike Currie, told the BBC that ""no-one really knows what is next"". ""I think what we can be certain of is that we'll see under-employment, where employees return to work but possibly not on a full-time basis and that they might need to supplement their income."" Unemployment rate: How many people are out of work? How do I find a new job and who is hiring? What are my rights if I am made redundant? Furlough was introduced in March 2020 after Covid-19 forced large parts of the UK economy to close. Officially known as the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, it saw the government pay towards the wages of people who could not work, or whose employers could no longer afford to pay them, up to a monthly limit of Â£2,500. At first it paid 80% of their usual wage, but in August and September it paid 60%, with employers paying 20%. There have been big recruitment drives for hospitality staff, HGV drivers and warehouse workers as businesses get back on their feet. This video can not be played Abi is finally back to work after 18 months on furlough and says it feels 'amazing' Latest official figures,externalshow the UK's economy grew by 5.5% between April and June - revised up from the initial estimate of 4.8%. The uplift was largely driven by household spending rebounding after lockdowns, although many firms are now being held back by current labour shortages. ""Any hope that the end of the furlough scheme might be the magic wand to solve the supply chain crisis is likely to be wishful thinking,"" said Susannah Streeter, from Hargreaves Lansdown. There is likely to be a big mismatch of skills and experience between those leaving the furlough scheme and the jobs on offer, she added. Chief Secretary to the Treasury Simon Clarke told the BBC: ""We think there are probably two million fewer people unemployed than would have been the case if this scheme hadn't been introduced. ""I think it's done an enormous amount to shield our economy and our society from the worst of Covid."" The scheme has also been praised by the Resolution Foundation think tank as a ""great success"". Its senior economist Dan Tomlinson said furlough had been ""as critical to fighting the Covid crisis as nationalising the banks was to fighting the global financial crisis"". But the foundation's recent research,externalsuggested that a small rise in unemployment was a ""real risk"" for those still on the scheme as it ends, particularly older workers or those in the travel sector. When the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme started, it was described as a bridge over the pandemic uncertainty. It has succeeded in keeping the official unemployment numbers at less than half pre-pandemic expectation. For that reason it has proven value for money, despite costing over Â£68bn. But there is now some uncertainty over the fate of the million or so workers still having their wages subsidised. New analysis from the Institute for Fiscal Studies points to regional differences, with London workers for example the most likely still to be furloughed. Older workers are also disproportionately still on the scheme. Industries that are yet to return to normal, such as the airport sector, had called for the scheme to be kept in some form. Unions also argue that the UK should follow Germany in maintaining a form of the scheme for future crises. Certainly a precedent has been set in that the government is willing to spend billions on wage increases if large-scale increases in unemployment are avoided. Although a million vacancies do not map on to the same number still on furlough, it is clear that many industries are having to welcome back more furloughed workers. Partly out of fear of being caught out by worker shortages later down the line. For many of those returning to work, conditions will not be the same as pre-pandemic. Jess Pitman was furloughed from her job as marketing manager at a travel firm two weeks after the scheme was introduced. The company she works for specialises in organising trips abroad to raise money for charities, but travellers cancelled their plans when Covid hit. The firm's payroll has been reduced from 27 to just five and the 29-year-old will return to work part-time, topping up her income with freelance work. Jess Pitman works for a travel firm, which organises fundraising trips for charity ""I feel really torn about the end of furlough, and I'm really sad for the travel industry as a whole,"" Jess said. ""I know a lot of people in the industry will be made redundant... I think we'll lose a lot of talented people, which is really disappointing."" A spokesperson for the Association of British Travel Agents (Abta) warned that companies in the sector still face ""extreme difficulties"" because of continued travel restrictions. Abta called for sector-specific support for smaller firms in particular, who have lost two summers of sales, as well as those which specialise in destinations still subject to red list rules. ""The government needs to look at how it can support these businesses... through a package of tailored financial support,"" the spokesperson added. Elsewhere, the Federation of Small Businesses also cited concerns over a ""colder environment"" for business. Employers and workers alike will have to cope with the end of the furlough scheme, as well as the scrapping of an incentive for hiring apprentices, rising energy bills and the planned cut to Universal Credit in October. However, the Treasury said generous support was being provided through its ""Plan for Jobs"", which it said was part of a Â£400bn spending package. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said he was ""immensely proud of the furlough scheme, and even more proud of UK workers and businesses whose resolve has seen us through an immensely difficult time"".

"The body of Sarah Everard was found hidden in woodland Sarah Everard was a ""wholly blameless victim of a grotesque series of circumstances"", a judge has said. Wayne Couzens, a Met Police officer, strangled Ms Everard with his police belt after kidnapping her during a false arrest. Couzens showed his warrant card before restraining the 33-year-old, putting her in his hire car and driving away. Lord Justice Fulford said he had ""no doubt Couzens used his position as a police officer to coerce her into car"". Ahead of sentencing Couzens,external, the judge said the circumstances of the case were ""devastating, tragic and wholly brutal"". The evidence gathered against him was ""unanswerable"" and there was ""no credible innocent explanation"" for it, he said. In full: Sarah Everard's family on their loss Sarah Everard: Daughter, sister, friend and colleague The judge added that Couzens went ""hunting a lone female to kidnap and rape"" having planned his actions in ""unspeakably"" grim detail. The defendant's preparations included taking some of his police kit with him and lying to his family about working on the night of the murder, he said. This video can not be played A CCTV timeline shows key evidence used to arrest and prosecute Wayne Couzens Prosecutor Tom Little QC previously suggested the case was so exceptional and unprecedented that it could warrant a whole life order, meaning Couzens would die in jail. During mitigation earlier, defence barrister Jim Sturman QC said his client was filled with ""self-loathing"". He told the Old Bailey that nothing he said was intended to minimise the ""horror"" of what Couzens did that night and after, but he argued against a whole-life order. ""He accepts he will receive and deserves severe punishment,"" Mr Sturman said, ""No right-minded person... can feel anything other than revulsion for what he did."" The barrister claimed that Couzens should not be sentenced to a whole-life order on three grounds: his guilty pleas, underlying depression and that he has no previous convictions for violence. Ms Everard's family was in court for Couzens' guilty plea Ms Everard's family previously said therecan be ""no redemption for what he had done"". The defendant was not able to look at the family during the hearing. Mr Sturman added: ""He is ashamed. What he has done is terrible and he deserves a very lengthy finite term. ""But he did all he could after he was arrested to minimise the wicked harm that he did."" Lucy Manning, BBC special correspondent, from the Old Bailey: Wayne Couzens walked into the dock, bent over, again looking down at the floor. After the emotion of Wednesday when he was made to look up and face the Everard family as they described the impact of losing Sarah, he will find out today if he will spend the rest of his life in jail. The Everard family are in court to hear what sentence he will receive. As Couzens' barrister told the court that the policeman doesn't seek to make excuses for anything that he'd done and he is filled with self loathing and abject shame, Sarah Everard's mother stared at her daughter's murderer. He never looked up. As they said yesterday, all they want is Sarah back and no punishment he receives will ever compare to the pain and torture Couzens inflicted on them. Couzens' two-day sentencing hearing, which started on Wednesday, heard that Ms Everard's ordeal could be summarised as ""deception, kidnap, rape, strangulation, fire"". The firearms officer, who had clocked off from a 12-hour shift at the American embassy that morning, drove to a secluded rural area near Dover in Kent, where he parked up and raped Ms Everard. How a police officer covered up Sarah Everard's murder Sarah Everard's family 'tormented' by her murder The marketing executive, who lived in Brixton, south London, had been strangled by 02:30 GMT the following morning, the Old Bailey heard. Couzens burned her body in a refrigerator in an area of woodland he owned in Hoads Wood, near Ashford, before dumping her remains in a nearby pond. He was arrested at his home in Deal, Kent, after police connected him to a hire car he used to abduct Ms Everard, whose remains were found by police dogs on 10 March. Couzens' defence barrister said his client was filled with ""self-loathing"" A whole-life order means the criminal is in prison for the rest of their life without ever becoming eligible for parole. It differs from a life sentence, under which the prisoner is given a number of years they must spend in jail after which they will be eligible to apply for parole. Whole-life tariffs are reserved for offenders judged to be the most dangerous to society.

That's 31,539 first doses and 34,093 second jabs. That means a total of 48,829,118 people have had a first jab and 44,867,373 people have had two doses of a vaccine.

Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance reporter Annual house price growth of 10% or more has been recorded for each of the past five months, according to data from the Nationwide. The rapid rise in house prices continues despite the tax holiday on stamp duty rates, introduced in July 2020, coming to an end in England and Northern Ireland today. Stamp duty is atax paid on property purchases,external. In July 2020, the government announced a cut to help buyers whose finances were affected by Covid. Until 31 March 2021, home buyers didn't have to pay stamp duty on the first Â£500,000 of a purchase price. This meant a saving of up to Â£15,000. The government later extended the tax holiday until 30 June, and then again until 30 September. During this period home buyers didn't have to pay stamp duty on the first Â£250,000. From tomorrow, rates return to pre-Covid levels, which means the point at which buyers  start paying stamp duty will be Â£125,001. So what will happen next? Will prices continue to surge, or will demand waiver? And are soaring house prices down solely to the stamp duty cut? Here is everything you need to know as the stamp duty holiday comes to an end.

The film was due for release in April 2020 but had itsworld premiere last night. Naomie Harris, who is playing Moneypenny for the third time, says she is ""really hoping that it does entice people back into into cinemas and they feel comfortable doing that because it's such a special movie."" Advance ticket sales in the UK have been at levels not seen since before cinemas shut at the start of the pandemic, according to the Odeon and Cineworld chains. After seeing the film at Odeon Luxe Leicester Square cinema Henry Wheeler, 25, labelled the film as ""fantastic"".
""It was the best Bond film for a while. I enjoyed it,"" he says. ""I haven't been to the cinema in more than a year and it was good to go back."" Read more:Why cinemas will bounce back from the Coronavirus crisis The Scottish government's vaccine passport scheme could be undermined if people were able to show a negative coronavirus test result as an alternative, the Deputy First Minister says. John Swinney says the focus of the scheme is to drive up vaccination rates as much as possible. He also says he expects nightclubs and large events to start using the vaccine passport system this weekend but enforcement will not begin until 18 October. Swinney made the comments as he addressed MSPs on Holyrood's Covid-19 Committee earlier. A group of experts appearing before the committee noted that Scotland's vaccine passport scheme differs from those of other European countries in that it does not include a negative Covid test as an alternative. Swinney, the Covid Recovery Secretary, says the government will continue to consider whether testing can also be included. Here's more detail on Scotland's Covidvaccine passport scheme. The Covid-19 vaccination programme in England is estimated to have prevented 261,500 hospital admissions among people aged 45 and over, according to new figures from Public Health England. Previous estimates had put the number at 230,800 admissions. Estimates for the number of deaths prevented by vaccinations in England have also increased to 127,500, from a previous figure of 123,100. Figures show a 17.3% uptake disparity between 16 and 17 year olds in deprived and affluent areas. In Wales, 16 and 17-year-olds are far more likely to take up the offer of a Covid vaccine in more affluent parts of the country than they are in more deprived areas. Public Health Wales (PHW) figures show 61% had been given a first dose of a jab in the most deprived areas of Wales - compared to 78.3% in the least deprived areas. Healthy 16 and 17-year-olds have been eligible for a jab for six weeks and up to Tuesday night, 71.2% had received a first dose. When looking at the uptake among that age group by sex, girls are ahead at 70%, with boys at 66.4%. We've got more on the breakdown of teenage uptake in terms of gender, economic background and ethnic grouphere. Irish passport holders who live and were vaccinated in Northern Ireland can now access the EU Digital Covid Certificate. The vaccine ""passport"", which allows international travel,came into effect in the Republic of Ireland in July. Most Irish passport holders in NI were not able to access the certificate because they were vaccinated outside of the Republic. People in Northern Ireland can nowapply for the certificate online,external. The Irish Minister for Health, Stephen Donnelly, says he is""delighted"" to expand the service. Two men have denied breaching the public order act after BBC journalist Nicholas Watt was chased by protesters near Downing Street during an anti-lockdown protest. Joseph Olswang, 38, and Alexander Peat, 34, appeared at Westminster Magistrates' Court earlier, accused of using threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour with intent to cause harassment, alarm or distress on 14 June. Magistrates released Peat on unconditional bail to appear for trial on 29 November while Olswang is due to appear in the same court again later. Crowds had gathered in Westminster in June to protest against the government's extension of coronavirus restrictions in England by four weeks. Footage shared on social media showed demonstrators confronting the broadcaster near Richmond Terrace and Whitehall. The journalist, who was wearing a BBC lanyard, was forced to run through the crowd beyond a line of police officers as people shouted at him. Christopher Aitken, 62, from Brixton, and Martin Hockridge, 57, are also due to stand trial in November charged with the same offence.
They were both released on bail until the trial date. This video can not be played End of furlough: 'The scheme was a godsend' The furlough scheme, which comes to an end today, has been described as a ""godsend"" that kept businesses afloat. It was set up in March 2020 and involved the government helping to pay the wages of people who could not work due to the coronavirus pandemic. Seaneen Monaghan, a caterer, says furlough was a ""blessing"". We explained earlier how exams are going to work next year. The aim is to get GCSE and A-level grades back to pre-pandemic levels. Some measures are being introduced to deal with potential disruption Covid could cause in the coming months - but how else are pupils being helped?"" BBC News education reporter Hannah Richardson explains. Hospitality has been hit hard by the pandemic As we have been reporting, the furlough scheme comes to a close today - with an estimated one million workers still on the scheme. Many of them will have relied on furlough for a significant part of their income during the pandemic. The government stresses about half of those have been on ""flexible furlough"" at the end of the scheme, and have been working for part of the week and should have a job to return to now. But some others may be made redundant once government support is removed. So what happens next to those workers who may no longer have a job? We've heard much aboutrecord number of job vacanciesat present - but which sectors have vacancies, who is hiring - and how easy is it to transfer your skills from one field of employment to another? Find out how to maximise your potential in the job markethere. At First Minister's Questions Edinburgh Labour MSP Daniel Johnson brings up the furlough scheme, which ends today, saying there are more than 100,000 people in Scotland who are still reliant on the payments. He asks the FM if she thinks the Scottish government is doing enough to help those who find themselves out of work. Nicola Sturgeon says she will continue to do everything she can and continue to consider this on an ongoing basis and help low income families and the unemployed. She says it would be better if Scotland didn't have to go cap-in-hand to a UK government to ask for furlough to be continued. She says if Labour is serious about these issues they have to get into a position of giving the Scottish parliament the means to do what it wants to do. ""We are suffering the impact of decisions that are beyond the control of this government and this parliament and there will always be a limit to what we can do to mitigate the impact of those decisions,"" says Sturgeon.  A man taking part in the Novavax Covid vaccine trial has accused the company of ""washing their hands"" of volunteers when it comes to booster jabs. Derek Robson, 63, from Hartlepool, was vaccinated in November 2020 and is now due a booster jab but the trial site is not offering them and he is unable to access a deployed vaccine booster via the NHS. ""I now feel that I'm entering the winter months without any, or reduced, protection against Covid,"" says Derek. Novavax says it ""empathises"" with the concerns of participants in its trial and is urgently seeking guidance. Last year, volunteers,including two government ministers, signed up for trials of the Novavax vaccine being developed by the US-based company. In Januarypositive results for its UK trialwere posted, but it has not yet filed for approval and the trial remains ongoing. Participants in the trial have received letters saying Novavax ""could not provide guidance on the safety of... a booster of an approved vaccine after having previously received two doses of the Novavax vaccine... because data to support such advice does not exist"". Derek says: ""They appear to have abandoned the volunteers. ""My experience to date suggests Novavax trial volunteers cannot get any alternative vaccine as no-one wants to take any responsibility. ""It seems that both Novavax and the NHS have washed their hands of the trial volunteers."" In a statement, Novavax says it has sought ""urgent guidance"" from the NHS and the JCVI (Joint Committee on Vaccinations and Immunisations) regarding boosters, and will share any updates when available.

At First Minister's Questions Edinburgh Labour MSP Daniel Johnson brings up the furlough scheme, which ends today, saying there are more than 100,000 people in Scotland who are still reliant on the payments. He asks the FM if she thinks the Scottish government is doing enough to help those who find themselves out of work. Nicola Sturgeon says she will continue to do everything she can and continue to consider this on an ongoing basis and help low income families and the unemployed. She says it would be better if Scotland didn't have to go cap-in-hand to a UK government to ask for furlough to be continued. She says if Labour is serious about these issues they have to get into a position of giving the Scottish parliament the means to do what it wants to do.

Read more:Why cinemas will bounce back from the Coronavirus crisis The Scottish government's vaccine passport scheme could be undermined if people were able to show a negative coronavirus test result as an alternative, the Deputy First Minister says. John Swinney says the focus of the scheme is to drive up vaccination rates as much as possible. He also says he expects nightclubs and large events to start using the vaccine passport system this weekend but enforcement will not begin until 18 October. Swinney made the comments as he addressed MSPs on Holyrood's Covid-19 Committee earlier. A group of experts appearing before the committee noted that Scotland's vaccine passport scheme differs from those of other European countries in that it does not include a negative Covid test as an alternative. Swinney, the Covid Recovery Secretary, says the government will continue to consider whether testing can also be included. Here's more detail on Scotland's Covidvaccine passport scheme. The Covid-19 vaccination programme in England is estimated to have prevented 261,500 hospital admissions among people aged 45 and over, according to new figures from Public Health England. Previous estimates had put the number at 230,800 admissions. Estimates for the number of deaths prevented by vaccinations in England have also increased to 127,500, from a previous figure of 123,100. Figures show a 17.3% uptake disparity between 16 and 17 year olds in deprived and affluent areas. In Wales, 16 and 17-year-olds are far more likely to take up the offer of a Covid vaccine in more affluent parts of the country than they are in more deprived areas. Public Health Wales (PHW) figures show 61% had been given a first dose of a jab in the most deprived areas of Wales - compared to 78.3% in the least deprived areas. Healthy 16 and 17-year-olds have been eligible for a jab for six weeks and up to Tuesday night, 71.2% had received a first dose. When looking at the uptake among that age group by sex, girls are ahead at 70%, with boys at 66.4%. We've got more on the breakdown of teenage uptake in terms of gender, economic background and ethnic grouphere. Irish passport holders who live and were vaccinated in Northern Ireland can now access the EU Digital Covid Certificate. The vaccine ""passport"", which allows international travel,came into effect in the Republic of Ireland in July. Most Irish passport holders in NI were not able to access the certificate because they were vaccinated outside of the Republic. People in Northern Ireland can nowapply for the certificate online,external. The Irish Minister for Health, Stephen Donnelly, says he is""delighted"" to expand the service. Two men have denied breaching the public order act after BBC journalist Nicholas Watt was chased by protesters near Downing Street during an anti-lockdown protest. Joseph Olswang, 38, and Alexander Peat, 34, appeared at Westminster Magistrates' Court earlier, accused of using threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour with intent to cause harassment, alarm or distress on 14 June. Magistrates released Peat on unconditional bail to appear for trial on 29 November while Olswang is due to appear in the same court again later. Crowds had gathered in Westminster in June to protest against the government's extension of coronavirus restrictions in England by four weeks.

"Exam results rose for two years in a row GCSE and A-level grades in England will be returned to pre-Covid levels over the next two years, the government has announced. Next summer's results will be wound back to a ""mid-point"" between 2019 and 2021, after two years of unusually high grade inflation. Ministers say exams will happen but the option of teacher-assessed grades will be kept in reserve. Pupils will get notice of exam topics in some subjects to aid revision. And there will be a choice of questions in some arts subjects, as well as materials such as formulae for maths and science subjects. These modifications aim to protect pupils against lost learning due to the Covid pandemic. Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi says he is putting ""fairness at the heart"" of his plans for exams in 2022 and the year after. Last summer, exams were cancelled for the second year in a row due to the pandemic, and grades were again awarded by teachers. Pupils to get advance notice of exam topics in 2022 Exams altered next year after pandemic disruption Record GCSE results after second year of no exams This led to the proportion of pupils passing and scoring higher grades rising significantly for the second year in a row. Between 2019 and 2021, the proportion of GCSEs, for example, awarded the top grades 7 to 9, rose nearly 12 percentage points to 28.9%. Usually the share of grades is held steady, by a system of comparable outcomes designed to maintain standards from one year to the next. Exam boards use statistics and predictions to maintain fairness in the system. Chief regulator Dr Jo Saxton said: ""As we return to summer exams, in 2022 exam boards will set the grade boundaries based on a profile that reflects a mid-point between 2021 and pre-pandemic grading. ""This will provide a safety net for students, to reflect the disruption this cohort have experienced already in their course and recognising the fact that, because of the pandemic, most A-level students won't have taken public exams before. ""Our aim is to return to a pre-pandemic grade profile. ""But we don't think it would be fair on 2022's students to do it all in one go, given the disruption they have experienced. We will aim, therefore, to return in broadly two steps."" Dr Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said: ""The government and Ofqual are picking an arbitrary number out of the air in order to determine how many of each grade will be issued next summer. ""Such a random act undermines their argument that exams are the fairest way to assess students. ""Whilst last summer's system wasn't perfect, the grades at least were a reflection of what students themselves had done, rather than simply reflecting how much better or worse they were than their peers,"" she said. Ministers also confirmed a set of adaptations to exams including a choice of questions in English Literature, history, ancient history and geography. Teachers will also get information on the focus of exam content so they can guide students on what to revise - but not until February. Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, called for information on exam content to be shared earlier. ""It would also enable teachers to do the very best for each of their students, ensuring they cover as much of the specification as possible, and that they are well prepared for the exams and assessments,"" he said. But Ian Bauckham, interim chairman of exams watchdog Ofqual, said that if exam topics were announced too early it could discourage students from covering as much content as possible. Giving three to four months notice was ""the right balance to strike"", he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Mr Zahawiâ¯said: ""We are committed to rigorous standards being fairly applied, and exams are the fairest way to assess students, which is why they will take place next year.""

"This video can not be played ""Get your orders in early,"" one business is advising One supermarket chain is using extra freezers to make sure there are enough turkeys for Christmas, as shop owners warn of potential shortages this year. Shoppers in Wales have already seen some empty shelves which has been blamed on a lack of lorry drivers. Now, some business owners are warning supply and delivery issues could affect Christmas stock. Matthew Hunt, of Filco Foods supermarkets, said he expected to see higher prices this winter. He urged shoppers to get orders in early. Next warns of staff shortages and price rises Farmers warn of Christmas turkey shortage What's in short supply and why? ""At this stage turkey could be a concern so we've powered up our freezers, so if we're not able to offer a fresh bird we'll be able to offer a frozen one instead,"" he said. Sharon Flanagan is disappointed her early order for Christmas will not arrive on time Sharon Flanagan, who co-owns homeware shop No 39 in Cowbridge, Vale of Glamorgan, said despite putting her order in for Christmas stock in February, it would not now arrive until late November. ""We were hoping to introduce Christmas stock earlier this year after the lockdown last year and it's a disaster,"" she said. ""It's eight weeks we won't be able to trade on Christmas stock, so if you were hoping to come in October to pick something up for Christmas, it's not going to be here."" Jolene Barton says you might not be able to get exactly what you want - but there is plenty of stock to go around In Porthmadog, Gwynedd, Jolene Barton, director of online toy retailer Babi Pur, said shoppers might need to be ""a bit more open-minded this Christmas"". ""There's plenty of things to go around, it's just maybe you won't get exactly what you'd hoped for."" Ms Barton also said changes following Brexit could add to the disruption: ""There are a lot of extra costs, extra charges, problems with deliveries that have to be paid for. We can't keep absorbing those costs. ""I don't think retailers will be able to keep the costs down.""

He said: ""This year, with Covid, and you know something else is going to happen down the line, we like to be a little bit cautious and thought why not.""

"The furlough scheme closes on Thursday, with uncertainty ahead for people who have not yet fully returned to work. Nearly one million workers were expected to be on the scheme at the end of September, according to research by the Resolution Foundation. Of those on furlough in late July, about half on the scheme were able to work some of the time, the HMRC says. Since the start of the pandemic, it has helped paythe wages of 11.6 million workers,external. But many forecasters, including the Bank of England, are expecting a small rise in unemployment as it ends. The chancellor said he was ""immensely proud"" of the near Â£70bn scheme, but now was the right time to close it, despite calls for further support from some badly-hit companies. What will happen when furlough ends? What impact has the furlough scheme had? The travel sector has suffered more than most during the pandemic, with businesses being affected by changing restrictions and lower consumer confidence. Mark Andrew, the director of Animal Aircare, which helps pets travel overseas via Gatwick Airport, said some of his staff may be made redundant if business does not improve. The firm has not yet had to lay off staff, which Mr Andrew said was ""purely down to furlough"". Animal Aircare staff help pets travel overseas via Gatwick Airport ""Furlough ending means there's a real question mark for our business. We're still waiting for Gatwick to pick up... it seems the airline industry is not buoyant enough yet,"" he said. Although the end of the scheme comes amida record number of job vacancies, Fidelity International's investment director, Maike Currie, told the BBC that ""no-one really knows what is next"". ""I think what we can be certain of is that we'll see under-employment, where employees return to work but possibly not on a full-time basis and that they might need to supplement their income."" Unemployment rate: How many people are out of work? How do I find a new job and who is hiring? What are my rights if I am made redundant? Furlough was introduced in March 2020 after Covid-19 forced large parts of the UK economy to close. Officially known as the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, it saw the government pay towards the wages of people who could not work, or whose employers could no longer afford to pay them, up to a monthly limit of Â£2,500. At first it paid 80% of their usual wage, but in August and September it paid 60%, with employers paying 20%. There have been big recruitment drives for hospitality staff, HGV drivers and warehouse workers as businesses get back on their feet. This video can not be played Abi is finally back to work after 18 months on furlough and says it feels 'amazing' Latest official figures,externalshow the UK's economy grew by 5.5% between April and June - revised up from the initial estimate of 4.8%. The uplift was largely driven by household spending rebounding after lockdowns, although many firms are now being held back by current labour shortages. ""Any hope that the end of the furlough scheme might be the magic wand to solve the supply chain crisis is likely to be wishful thinking,"" said Susannah Streeter, from Hargreaves Lansdown. There is likely to be a big mismatch of skills and experience between those leaving the furlough scheme and the jobs on offer, she added. Chief Secretary to the Treasury Simon Clarke told the BBC: ""We think there are probably two million fewer people unemployed than would have been the case if this scheme hadn't been introduced. ""I think it's done an enormous amount to shield our economy and our society from the worst of Covid."" The scheme has also been praised by the Resolution Foundation think tank as a ""great success"". Its senior economist Dan Tomlinson said furlough had been ""as critical to fighting the Covid crisis as nationalising the banks was to fighting the global financial crisis"". But the foundation's recent research,externalsuggested that a small rise in unemployment was a ""real risk"" for those still on the scheme as it ends, particularly older workers or those in the travel sector. When the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme started, it was described as a bridge over the pandemic uncertainty. It has succeeded in keeping the official unemployment numbers at less than half pre-pandemic expectation. For that reason it has proven value for money, despite costing over Â£68bn. But there is now some uncertainty over the fate of the million or so workers still having their wages subsidised. New analysis from the Institute for Fiscal Studies points to regional differences, with London workers for example the most likely still to be furloughed. Older workers are also disproportionately still on the scheme. Industries that are yet to return to normal, such as the airport sector, had called for the scheme to be kept in some form. Unions also argue that the UK should follow Germany in maintaining a form of the scheme for future crises. Certainly a precedent has been set in that the government is willing to spend billions on wage increases if large-scale increases in unemployment are avoided. Although a million vacancies do not map on to the same number still on furlough, it is clear that many industries are having to welcome back more furloughed workers. Partly out of fear of being caught out by worker shortages later down the line. For many of those returning to work, conditions will not be the same as pre-pandemic. Jess Pitman was furloughed from her job as marketing manager at a travel firm two weeks after the scheme was introduced. The company she works for specialises in organising trips abroad to raise money for charities, but travellers cancelled their plans when Covid hit. The firm's payroll has been reduced from 27 to just five and the 29-year-old will return to work part-time, topping up her income with freelance work. Jess Pitman works for a travel firm, which organises fundraising trips for charity ""I feel really torn about the end of furlough, and I'm really sad for the travel industry as a whole,"" Jess said. ""I know a lot of people in the industry will be made redundant... I think we'll lose a lot of talented people, which is really disappointing."" A spokesperson for the Association of British Travel Agents (Abta) warned that companies in the sector still face ""extreme difficulties"" because of continued travel restrictions. Abta called for sector-specific support for smaller firms in particular, who have lost two summers of sales, as well as those which specialise in destinations still subject to red list rules. ""The government needs to look at how it can support these businesses... through a package of tailored financial support,"" the spokesperson added. Elsewhere, the Federation of Small Businesses also cited concerns over a ""colder environment"" for business. Employers and workers alike will have to cope with the end of the furlough scheme, as well as the scrapping of an incentive for hiring apprentices, rising energy bills and the planned cut to Universal Credit in October. However, the Treasury said generous support was being provided through its ""Plan for Jobs"", which it said was part of a Â£400bn spending package. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said he was ""immensely proud of the furlough scheme, and even more proud of UK workers and businesses whose resolve has seen us through an immensely difficult time"".

""Such a random act undermines their argument that exams are the fairest way to assess students. ""Whilst last summer's system wasn't perfect, the grades at least were a reflection of what students themselves had done, rather than simply reflecting how much better or worse they were than their peers,"" she said. Ministers also confirmed a set of adaptations to exams including a choice of questions in English Literature, history, ancient history and geography. Teachers will also get information on the focus of exam content so they can guide students on what to revise - but not until February. Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, called for information on exam content to be shared earlier. ""It would also enable teachers to do the very best for each of their students, ensuring they cover as much of the specification as possible, and that they are well prepared for the exams and assessments,"" he said. But Ian Bauckham, interim chairman of exams watchdog Ofqual, said that if exam topics were announced too early it could discourage students from covering as much content as possible. Giving three to four months notice was ""the right balance to strike"", he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Mr Zahawiâ¯said: ""We are committed to rigorous standards being fairly applied, and exams are the fairest way to assess students, which is why they will take place next year.""
