"During the first lockdown, the government encouraged people to pay tribute to healthcare workers by clapping Large numbers of staff could leave nursing when the pandemic is over after being offered a 1% pay rise, the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) has warned. Patricia Marquis from the RCN told Times Radio it made staff in England feel they were not valued and would worsen the NHS's recruitment issues. The body representing NHS trusts has joined unions to criticise the offer. But the government defended its proposal, saying public finances were under unprecedented strain. Ms Marquis, south-east regional director of the RCN, said ""significant numbers"" of nurses were planning to leave and ""this slap in the face from the government really has just reinforced their belief that they are not valued by either the government or perhaps some of the public in the way they would want to be"". She said there were 40,000 nursing vacancies when the pandemic began and there was a ""real risk"" of more experienced staff leaving. How much will NHS staff be paid? Nurse Susan Graham from Kent told the BBC the proposed pay rise was a ""disgrace"" after NHS staff had worked ""crazy hours"" during the Covid crisis. John Anderson, a nurse from East Sussex, said he had taken colleagues to intensive care after they caught coronavirus and called the pay offer a ""kick in the teeth"" for them and their families. ""It feels like the government are happy to have us risk our lives - or even die in this pandemic - but not pay us properly for our jobs,"" he said. The lowest minimum full-time salary - for newly-employed drivers, housekeeping assistants, nursery assistants and domestic support workers - is Â£18,005 per year The starting salary for most newly-qualified nurses is Â£24,907 Staff in ""high-cost areas"", such as London, get extra payments The Department of Health and Social Care has been under pressure to reconsider its pay proposal since last week, when it officially recommended the 1% rise to the independent panel that advises the government on NHS salaries. This video can not be played RCN South East Director Patricia Marquis told Times Radio ""there is a real risk we will lose significant numbers"" NHS Providers, the body that represents employers in the health service, has joined in criticism of the proposal, saying the government's long-term funding plan for the NHS assumed a pay increase in 2021-22 of 2.1% - more than double what is now being offered. Saffron Cordery, deputy chief executive of NHS Providers, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""Given where the NHS is at, given what frontline staff have been through, it seems absolutely wrong to take from their pockets right now the pay rise that was due to them."" Although these assumptions were published in 2019, before the pandemic, NHS Providers said the last year has ""strengthened the case for a larger pay rise for NHS staff"", recommending they receive at least 3%. But the Department of Health maintains that while it set out a legal commitment for funding the NHS, the assumption of a 2.1% pay rise was not enshrined in law, and the financial pressures from the pandemic could not have been foreseen. The NHS pay row in England, fuelled by angry responses from health unions, rumbles on and seems unlikely to fade away. It is significant that the employers have now entered the fray in the shape of NHS Providers, the group representing trusts in England. NHS trust leaders know only too well that morale is low among an exhausted workforce and they fear that the proposed wage rise will make things worse. They are in effect lining up with the unions to oppose the government. Ministers argue that the pandemic changed everything, including the state of the public finances, and that earlier plans have had to be rethought. They say that compared to other parts of the public workforce facing a pay freeze, the NHS workforce will fare better and that difficult measures were needed to respond to public borrowing increases. But after the unprecedented pressures on hospitals during the pandemic there is growing sympathy for health workers. There will be a difficult few months ahead as the pay review body considers the arguments and ministers decide on their next steps. Speaking at Friday's Downing Street briefing, Mr Hancock said the pay award reflected the ""difficult financial circumstances the country is in"". ""We've proposed what we think is affordable to make sure in the NHS people do get a pay rise,"" he said. But Tory MP Dan Poulter, a former health minister who continues to work as a doctor in mental health, said NHS staff had worked without the correct equipment in the early stages of the pandemic and went ""above and beyond"" their hours, so it was ""from a moral perspective, the wrong time to be applying pay restraint."" He said past experience of keeping down NHS wages had also proved it was ""quite counter-productive economically"", forcing the health service to pay more in agency costs instead. The British Medical Association, the Royal College of Midwives, the Royal College of Nursing and Unison wrote a joint letter to Chancellor Rishi Sunak to express their ""dismay"" at the pay rise. ""Our members are the doctors, nurses, midwives, porters, healthcare assistants and more, already exhausted and distressed, who are also expected to go on caring for the millions of patients on waiting lists, coping with a huge backlog of treatment as well as caring for those with Covid-19,"" the letter said. LOCKDOWN RULES:What are they and when will they end? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? COVID IMMUNITY:Can you catch it twice? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? Unite - the third largest union in the NHS - has also said it is considering a strike ballot, while the Royal College of Nursing has said its members should get a 12.5% increase. The pay award would cover nearly all hospital staff, but not GPs and dentists. In addition, some staff whose pay band is being changed will get more than a 1% increase as a result of apreviously agreed three-year pay deal. The government said newly-qualified nurses got a 12% pay rise over the course of that three-year agreement, adding that 1% was a ""real-terms increase"" as the latest official inflation figure was 0.9%. Meanwhile, Labour has said NHS ""heroes"" deserve more money and the proposed increase is ""nothing short of an insult"". This video can not be played The Labour leader says NHS staff and other public sector workers ""need to be properly rewarded"" Alex Norris, Labour's shadow health minister, said he would have recommended a real-terms increase for NHS staff, but said the exact figure should be set by the independent pay review body. He said the public had been out on their doorsteps clapping for the work of NHS staff during the pandemic, and the government should not be ""clapping for them one day and cutting their pay the next"". The NHS in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland is run by the devolved administrations. The Scottish government has announced that 2021-22 pay negotiations will bedelayed until the summer,externalbecause of the disruption caused by Covid. Staff have been given an ""interim"" pay rise of 1%, which will form part of the new settlement. NHS workers in Northern Ireland were promised aone-off Â£500 ""special recognition"" paymentin January, following a similar announcement in Scotland. The Welsh government has said it will not set a ""ceiling"" of 1% on NHS pay rises for 2021-22.

"Gorman was the youngest poet to ever perform at a presidential inauguration Amanda Gorman, the young poet who found global fame after performing at President Joe Biden's inauguration, has shared her experience of alleged racial profiling by a security guard. The 22-year-old said on Twitter that she was accosted on a walk home on Friday and told ""you look suspicious"". ""This is the reality of black girls: One day you're called an icon, the next day, a threat,"" she wrote. Gorman received widespread acclaim for her reading of The Hill We Climb. Her poem was seen as a rousing and timely call for national unity - delivered at the US Capitol just weeks after it was the scene of deadly riots. 'It's going to open doors for poets' Inauguration poet calls for 'unity and togetherness' Tweeting about her experience, Gorman described being ""tailed"" by the security guard who she said offered no apology after she was able to prove she lived in her own apartment building.

"The Queen presents the Gold Cup to Sheikh Mohammed at Ascot in 2012 The British Horseracing Authority has expressed its ""concern"" over claims by Sheikh Mohammed's daughter, Princess Latifa, that she has been imprisoned by her father and fears for her life. Dubai's ruler, Sheikh Mohammed, is racing's biggest benefactor, the owner of global racehorse operation Godolphin and the Newmarket-based stallion breeding operation, Darley. Nearly three weeks after Panorama revealed secret videos filmed by Princess Latifa, the governing body has addressed the issue for the first time. Julie Harrington, the BHA's new CEO, said the organisation ""shares the concerns"" raised by Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, and described the footage as ""clearly distressing"". She confirmed that the BHA has been in contact with the UK Government on the matter. The United Nations said on Friday it has not yet seen evidence that Princess Latifa is still alive. What does Princess Latifa case mean for British sport? Princess Latifa 'being cared for at home' - Dubai royal family Princess Latifa: UN 'yet to see proof of life' from UAE A year has passed - without comment from the BHA - since the family division of the High Court found Sheikh Mohammed to have been responsible for a campaign of intimidation against his former wife Princess Haya and for the abduction and forced return of two of his daughters from a different marriage - including Princess Latifa. The Sheikh insisted he was unable to participate in the court's fact-finding process, resulting in a judgement he said ""inevitably only tells one side of the story"". A Dubai Royal Family statement released after the Panorama programme said Latifa was being cared for at home and the media coverage was""not reflective of the actual position"". The Jockey Club - which owns Newmarket Racecourse, of which Godolphin is a sponsor - has also not commented on either matter. In response to questions from the BBC, Harrington said: ""We have heard the public comments made by the Foreign Secretary, Dominic Raab, in which he expressed concern about the distressing pictures shown on television. ""I share his concern - the footage clearly is distressing and we support Mr Raab's position that the UN human rights body should lead this investigation. ""We have taken time to consider the issues since Mr Raab spoke. These are complex matters, involving an overseas state with strategic ties to the United Kingdom. The matters go well beyond the world of racing, and the UN is involved. ""We can confirm that as part of this, we have been in contact with the British government to explain our responsibilities as regulator, as well as to highlight a significant investment and contribution to the British racing industry. ""We cannot discuss contact with government further and we are also not going to confirm whether we are or are not taking any action."" Within the BHA's rules on the suitability of owners, it says: ""The criteria to which the authority will have regard in assessing honesty and integrity, includeâ¦ whether the applicant has been the subject of any adverse finding by a judge in any civil proceedings."" However, the BHA's policy means it will not disclose whether investigations are ongoing. Harrington - who took the helm of the BHA in January after leaving British Cycling - warned separately that racing is facing an ""existential crisis"". She made the comments in an interview with the Racing Post, primarily focused on the fallout from the photograph of trainer Gordon Elliott sitting astride the body of a dead racehorse - for which he has been banned for 12 months, with the second 6 months suspended. However, she has also encountered several other issues in her first two months in the role, including the Panorama allegations about Sheikh Mohammed, the ongoing impact of coronavirus and gambling reforms which could cost the industry more than Â£60m. ""People use the phrase 'existential crisis' and I don't think that is underestimating it,"" Harrington told the newspaper. ""To see our sport on the front pages for the wrong reasons, and for the general public to have been given the perception our horses are not cared for, is a crisis for the industry.""

"Campaigners say centres of excellence could help lupus patients in Wales Calls have been made for specialist help in Wales to treat an incurable, life-limiting condition which takes an average of six years to diagnose. An estimated 2,000 people in Wales are affected bylupus,external. Campaigner Wendy Diment said centres of excellence would ""extend the lives"" of lupus patients in Wales. A Welsh Government spokeswoman said health boards could refer people for further treatment if it was not available locally. There is currently no cure for lupus and it occurs when the immune system mistakenly attacks healthy parts of the body. 'No-one seemed willing to treat me during Covid' Selena Gomez had lupus but what is it? ""Many GPs and even consultant rheumatologists have limited experience in diagnosing, treating and monitoring patients with lupus, which means that specialist care is often required,"" said Paul Howard, chief executive of charity Lupus UK. He has called for investment in services - but until then, wants rules over cross-border referrals relaxed, so care inEngland's nine centres,externalof excellence can be accessed by people in Wales. Research suggests people with lupus in Wales were twice as likely to be refused specialist help than in the rest of the UK. Lupus is estimated to affect one in 1,000 people in the UK For Mrs Diment, 46, the crippling fatigue and headaches would often leave her confined to her bed in tears. ""Some days I couldn't get out of my pyjamas. If I had a shower, I'd need a lie down. It takes a long time to get used to it, it's overwhelming and frustrating,"" she said. Mrs Diment, from Tenby, Pembrokeshire, believes the 'trigger' for her condition was the birth of her third child in 2008. At first she put the symptoms down to tiredness, though she had to quit her job as a legal executive, aged 35. It was not until four years later that a chance occurrence led to her diagnosis for the rare autoimmune disease. ""I became quite unwell in 2013, and had horrific rashes [another symptom of lupus] on my chest, feet and face. It seemed quite bizarre,"" she said. ""Steroids cleared it up and I forgot about it. But in October of that year, I was in bed at 7pm suffering from severe fatigue, when my husband watched a television programme on a new drug for a rare condition. ""He woke me up and said 'lupus'. It was the first time I'd heard of it."" It is an incurable immune system illness It can produce many symptoms and can lead to irreversible organ damage Many people with lupus are unusually sensitive to the sun, which can trigger a skin rash Affected organs include kidneys, skin, brains, hearts and lungs. Almost all patients experience pain and extreme fatigue Diagnosis typically takes six to seven years,external Nine out of ten patients are women and it is more common in people of black, Asian and minority ethnic heritage Source: Lupus UK,external She was diagnosed with a type of lupus that year, but the rashes that had appeared made her believe it was a different variant of the complex condition she was suffering from. It would take another four years - and paying to see a specialist in London - until her suspicions were proved right. While she acknowledges things have improved since the 1960s when it was treated as ""a terminal illness with survival not great past five years"", Mrs Diment still sees ""a bundle of prejudices"" around it. Some 90% of patients are women and it is sometimes treated in relation to mental health or dismissed as ""women saying they're tired"", she added. By taking 15 tablets a day, Mrs Diment is able to now focus on essentials, such as preparing meals for her children, as well as campaigning and running a support group for 50 other sufferers. Lupus can be hard to diagnose because of the wide variety of symptoms between patients She wants to see centres of excellence established in north and south Wales to employ specialists, researchers and nurses to help with health and lifestyle. ""I get frustrated how many ask for referrals to England or second opinions on their diagnosis,"" she said. ""They are so poorly and unwell, they don't question the system, just accept it as their fate. ""In England it is a specialism, so they have improved outcomes. ""People in Wales would just like reassurances they are getting the best care which can extend their lives."" Her local Senedd Member, Paul Davies, said: ""I hope the Welsh Government will at least commit to looking at establishing centres of excellence in Wales, so people here have access to the same level of support and services that patients do in England."" Les James was forced to retire early from a job he loved for the Ministry of Justice Among those waiting for more specialised care is Les James, from Carmarthen. The condition is far less common in men and Mr James has not been diagnosed by a doctor after nine years. However, he has shown many of the symptoms which can leave him in extreme pain for months at a time and is being helped by a lupus support group in west Wales. He was forced to retire ten years ago, aged 53, and was given medication for a variety of conditions, includingantiphospholipid syndrome,external- which also affects the immune system. ""For six months in 2019, I couldn't walk. My feet were so painful, it was like putting them on a cobbly beach,"" said Mr James, who takes 165 grams of morphine twice a day. ""Eventually, it went away. But I regularly get pains in my toes and heels."" Researcher Mel Sloan found patients in Wales felt less satisfied with support than those in the rest of the UK Cambridge University research associate Melanie Sloan - who has lupus - is leading a teamsurveying attitudes,externalof patients. Of 236 respondents, 43% of those in Wales said they had been refused a referral to see a specialist, compared to 21% in the rest of the UK. Campaign groupFair Treatment for the Women of Wales,externalsaid there is a lack of awareness of the ""huge impact"" and lack of investment in specialist services. ""Within our patient community, we hear far too often of women's symptoms being downplayed or not adequately managed and this has significant consequences for patients' long-term health,"" a spokeswoman added. The Welsh Government spokeswoman said it recognised the impact lupus can have on people's health and lives. ""We will be consulting about musculoskeletal conditions, including lupus, and their treatment,"" a spokeswoman added. ""We will continue to work with relevant organisations, including Lupus UK and Cymru Versus Arthritis, to improve treatment for people affected."" Andrew Carruthers, director of operations at the Hywel Dda health board in west Wales, said it holds lupus clinics conducted by consultant rheumatologists. Patients who cannot be managed within the health board area are referred to tertiary centres of excellence as clinically required, he added. Mr Carruthers said: ""We have participated in the British Society for Rheumatology lupus audit which showed the health board was above average for both the Welsh and UK average for most of the standards set out and we are committed to improving on these standards to further enhance the care for patients with lupus.""

It will be sold as a non-fungible token (NFT) - a unique digital certificate that states who owns a photo, video or other form of online media. But the post will remain publicly available on Twitter even after it has been auctioned off. The buyer will receive a certificate, digitally signed and verified by Mr Dorsey, as well as the metadata of the original tweet. The data will include information such as the time the tweet was posted and its text contents. Most of this information, however, is already publicly available. Allow Twitter content?

The tweet was listed for sale on 'Valuables by Cent',external- a tweets marketplace that was launched three months ago. In a post on the site, the platform's founders compare the buying of a tweet to that of a more traditional autograph or piece of memorabilia. ""Owning any digital content can be a financial investment,"" it says. ""[It can] hold sentimental value. Like an autograph on a baseball card, the NFT itself is the creator's autograph on the content, making it scarce, unique, and valuable."" Tweets are the latest digital assets to be monetised through so-called non-fungible tokens. NFTs use the blockchain, the same distributed database technology underlying Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, to create unique certificates of ownership of any kind of digital goods. While the idea that digital artists can earn an income by offering buyers some sense of ownership has its attractions, the ""sale"" of tweets will leave many scratching their heads. Valuables, the platform marketing Mr Dorsey's tweet, seems to recognise that the concept will leave people bemused. In its FAQ it explains ""owning any digital content can... hold sentimental value and create a relationship between collector and creator"". Most of us might think that this is a high price to pay for a relationship with the Twitter boss. But given the feverish and often irrational state of any kind of cryptocurrency related market, maybe the buyer is betting there'll be someone along soon to take the tweet off their hands at an even higher price. Meanwhile, on the basis that if you can't beat them, join them, I put one of my tweets up for sale. It was about this story - and I've just accepted a bid of $1.  That might sound modest but seeing as I've got 72,466 other tweets available it could be the start of something bigâ¦. Old offers for Mr Dorsey's tweet suggest that it was first put up for sale in December, but the listing gained more attention after he tweeted a link to it on Friday. That tweet has since been shared thousands of times. Within minutes of the tweet being posted, bids reached more than $88,000. But they skyrocketed on Saturday, with a bid of $1.5m being usurped by a $2m offer at around 15:30 GMT. According to Valuables by Cent's terms, 95% of a tweet's sale will go to the original creator with the remainder going to the website.

"Holly hadn't expected difficulties with EWS1 NHS worker Holly Ciesielczuk bought 75% of her first-floor flat in Redbridge in March 2019, under shared ownership. But when she tried to borrow more money to increase her share of ownership a year later, she hit a stumbling block. Following their initial survey, her mortgage lender requested an EWS1 form, which can be obtained following an assessment of a building's external walls. These were first developed to assess the potential financial impact of cladding on high-rise flats, after 72 people died at Grenfell Tower. To begin with, only those who owned flats in tall buildings with dangerous flammable cladding were affected. But after the government extended its advice to smaller properties in January 2020, mortgage lenders began demanding fire surveys from a much wider range of sellers. The reason Holly was given by her lender for requesting one was that a balcony on the building had a wooden floor. However, she says her housing association would not agree to an EWS1 because, it said, the building was not high enough to meet the criteria. The lender refused a mortgage without it, as did the next bank she tried. The combination of this and her partner's cancer diagnosis took its toll. ""I properly broke down. If I knew how much stress this was going to cause, I would never have bought my flat,"" she told the BBC. In November, the government said an agreement had been reached with the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS), banking trade body UK Finance and the Building Societies Association. It said this meant owners of flats in buildings without cladding would no longer need the form to sell or remortgage. But mortgage lenders said they ""did not consent"" to the announcement. Problems are still being encountered - including by Holly. When she contacted her lender after the November announcement, their position had not altered. ""I was so hopeful, so excited - but then so dismayed when I was told, 'You still need an EWS1 form.'"" Following a consultation on the requirement for EWS1 checks, RICS plans to release updated guidance. It's understood this could be published as soon as next week. It will be aimed at narrowing down the number of EWS1 requests, but there's no obligation for lenders to follow it. ""Naively or optimistically, I hope the guidance will provide clarity about whether I will be able to get a mortgage,"" Holly says. Alex hasn't been able to buy his first home Even when building management agree to having checks done, it can be a lengthy process. Alex Cross from Berkshire was excited to find what he thought was his ""perfect"" first flat, yet he too has been held up. When he was asked to obtain an EWS1 form to secure a mortgage, the property management company refused to help. They said they owned 4,000 blocks, but only 48 inspections had been booked that financial year. ""At that rate, it would take decades to obtain the required information,"" Alex points out. He eventually found one bank that did not require the full survey, but asked a set of questions about the building's safety, which the property developer would not answer. Rebecca Frisina and her family were hoping to move to a larger property, but have been unable to sell their flat. Although they have found a buyer, the mortgage provider has requested a EWS1 form for their property. The management company which owns the freehold eventually agreed to pursue the safety checks. However, it isn't clear when they might take place. Rebecca's family are now living with her parents and their buyer has moved into rented accommodation. ""We have asked for a rough estimated timeline and they have refused to answer us,"" she says. ""It's been a nightmare."" Rebecca's family had to move in with her parents Andrew Montlake is managing director of mortgage broker Coreco and chairman of the Association of Mortgage Intermediaries. He says one of the first things his team now ask about a property is whether there is cladding and whether an EWS1 has been produced. ""There are cases I'm sure where the buildings are probably OK. However, where you're dealing with such a serious subject, surely it's better to be safe than sorry. If the valuers aren't sure, they're going to cover themselves ""If there's a risk of a leaseholder having to pay repair bills in future, that could have an impact on affordability."" UK Finance also pointed out that some buildings might have cladding that is not obvious. The fee for an EWS1 survey can be up to Â£50,000, depending on the size and style of the property. It's estimated that there are only 300 chartered fire engineers in the UK who can carry out the survey, which is believed to be a cause of delays. A social media campaign, #EndOurCladdingScandal, has attracted support from a wide range of homeowners, including those subject to EWS1 requirements. ""RICS and the government can offer as much guidance as they want, but the truth is the genie is out of the bottle - and mortgage lenders are spooked,"" a spokesperson for the campaign said. The Ministry for Housing, Communities and Local Government said in a statement: ""The EWS1 is not a government form, nor a legal requirement, and we're disappointed this is being asked for in some cases where it's not needed. ""If a form is genuinely needed, we are providing Â£700,000 of funding to train up to 2,000 more surveyors to speed up the process and get through the backlog.""

"The Queen presents the Gold Cup to Sheikh Mohammed at Ascot in 2012 The British Horseracing Authority has expressed its ""concern"" over claims by Sheikh Mohammed's daughter, Princess Latifa, that she has been imprisoned by her father and fears for her life. Dubai's ruler, Sheikh Mohammed, is racing's biggest benefactor, the owner of global racehorse operation Godolphin and the Newmarket-based stallion breeding operation, Darley. Nearly three weeks after Panorama revealed secret videos filmed by Princess Latifa, the governing body has addressed the issue for the first time. Julie Harrington, the BHA's new CEO, said the organisation ""shares the concerns"" raised by Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, and described the footage as ""clearly distressing"". She confirmed that the BHA has been in contact with the UK Government on the matter. The United Nations said on Friday it has not yet seen evidence that Princess Latifa is still alive. What does Princess Latifa case mean for British sport? Princess Latifa 'being cared for at home' - Dubai royal family Princess Latifa: UN 'yet to see proof of life' from UAE A year has passed - without comment from the BHA - since the family division of the High Court found Sheikh Mohammed to have been responsible for a campaign of intimidation against his former wife Princess Haya and for the abduction and forced return of two of his daughters from a different marriage - including Princess Latifa. The Sheikh insisted he was unable to participate in the court's fact-finding process, resulting in a judgement he said ""inevitably only tells one side of the story"". A Dubai Royal Family statement released after the Panorama programme said Latifa was being cared for at home and the media coverage was""not reflective of the actual position"". The Jockey Club - which owns Newmarket Racecourse, of which Godolphin is a sponsor - has also not commented on either matter. In response to questions from the BBC, Harrington said: ""We have heard the public comments made by the Foreign Secretary, Dominic Raab, in which he expressed concern about the distressing pictures shown on television. ""I share his concern - the footage clearly is distressing and we support Mr Raab's position that the UN human rights body should lead this investigation. ""We have taken time to consider the issues since Mr Raab spoke. These are complex matters, involving an overseas state with strategic ties to the United Kingdom. The matters go well beyond the world of racing, and the UN is involved. ""We can confirm that as part of this, we have been in contact with the British government to explain our responsibilities as regulator, as well as to highlight a significant investment and contribution to the British racing industry. ""We cannot discuss contact with government further and we are also not going to confirm whether we are or are not taking any action."" Within the BHA's rules on the suitability of owners, it says: ""The criteria to which the authority will have regard in assessing honesty and integrity, includeâ¦ whether the applicant has been the subject of any adverse finding by a judge in any civil proceedings."" However, the BHA's policy means it will not disclose whether investigations are ongoing. Harrington - who took the helm of the BHA in January after leaving British Cycling - warned separately that racing is facing an ""existential crisis"". She made the comments in an interview with the Racing Post, primarily focused on the fallout from the photograph of trainer Gordon Elliott sitting astride the body of a dead racehorse - for which he has been banned for 12 months, with the second 6 months suspended. However, she has also encountered several other issues in her first two months in the role, including the Panorama allegations about Sheikh Mohammed, the ongoing impact of coronavirus and gambling reforms which could cost the industry more than Â£60m. ""People use the phrase 'existential crisis' and I don't think that is underestimating it,"" Harrington told the newspaper. ""To see our sport on the front pages for the wrong reasons, and for the general public to have been given the perception our horses are not cared for, is a crisis for the industry.""

"There are concerns pupils could be forced to isolate unnecessarily due to inaccurate Covid test results when schools reopen in England on Monday Mass testing using lateral flow devices is to be carried out in secondary schools Research suggests they can offer a false positive result between 1 and 3 times for every thousand carried out More unions have put pressure on the government to reconsider its planned 1% pay rise for NHS staff in England Hospital leaders in England back the demands, saying ministers previously budgeted for a pay rise of 2.1% Staff feel undervalued and many could leave nursing when the pandemic is over, the Royal College of Nursing warns The government has defended its proposal, saying public finances are under unprecedented strain A mystery person in the UK infected with the Covid variant of concern first found in Brazil is traced Rapid Covid testing is now available to all workplaces in England Edited by Holly Wallis That's it for our live coverage for today. It was brought to you by Holly Wallis, Becky Morton and Adrian Dalingwater. Here's a round-up of some of the latest developments in the UK and around the world:  The latest pandemic figures reported by the UK government show continuing falls in the number of cases and deaths. In the seven days up to 6 March, there were 42,826 new recorded infections, a drop of 22,018 (34%) on the number for the previous week. Over the same period, there were 1,542 deaths, a fall of 799 (34.1%) on the previous week.  The government has released the latest figures for coronavirus cases and deaths in the UK. There have been6,040new cases since the last tally was published on Friday, and a further158deaths. Both figures appear to confirm the steadily  decreasing level of cases and fatalities reported in recent weeks. In terms of vaccinations,21,796,278people had been given a first dose and1,090,840people had been given a second dose by the end of Friday. Thousands gathered inside Sydney cricket ground on Saturday for the city's annual Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras celebration. Revellers usually line the city's streets for a huge parade but plans were altered this year because of the pandemic. Some 36,000 attended the stadium event instead - though a small protest march also took place on the usual parade route after an exemption was issued by health officials. Around 5,000 people also took part in a parade, which for 2021 was themed ""Rise"", chosen ""after the challenge and hardship"" of the last year. While gatherings of thousands are unthinkable in much of the world right now, the state of New South Wales has gone 48 days without local coronavirus transmission. Australia has only recorded about 29,000 cases and 900 deaths throughout the whole pandemic. You can see more picture from the celebrationshere. The priority list for the coronavirus vaccine in the UK is set by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation and is primarily in order of age. However, health and social care workers, as well as younger people who are clinically vulnerable are also being prioritised. Between now and the 15 April, the government is aiming to offer everyone over 50, as well as all over-16s with an underlying health condition and unpaid carers for the elderly and disabled, a first jab. There is a target of offering a first dose to everyone over the age of 18 by the end of July. You can read more about the vaccine rollouthere. Some Rangers fans have gathered outside Ibrox Stadium in Glasgow despite coronavirus lockdown rules. Images posted on social media showed flares being set off and fans singing ahead of Rangers' game against St Mirren. No one has been arrested. Under the current restrictions in Scotland public gatherings are banned and a maximum of two people from two households are allowed to meet outdoors. Football games are taking place behind closed doors with no fans in the stadium. Read more. Since 8 December about 18 million people have received at least one dose of a coronavirus vaccine in England. This covers about 38% of the population over the age of 16, according to NHS England figures. Of England's 314 local authorities, NHS data suggestsTendringin Essex vaccinated the highest percentage of its estimated population, as of 28 February, at 51%. Tower Hamletsin London vaccinated the lowest, at 14%. You can read more about how the rollout varies across the country - and the possible reasons behind this -here. Hugh PymBBC News Health Editor The NHS pay row in England, fuelled by angry responses from health unions, rumbles on and seems unlikely to fade away. It is significant that the employers have now entered the fray in the shape of NHS Providers, the group representing hospitals and other trusts in England. NHS trust leaders know only too well that morale is low among an exhausted workforce and they fear that the proposed wage rise will make things worse. They are in effect lining up with the unions to oppose the government. Ministers argue that the pandemic changed everything, including the state of the public finances, and that earlier plans have had to be rethought. They say that compared to other parts of the public workforce facing a pay freeze, the NHS workforce will fare better and that difficult measures were needed to respond to public borrowing increases. But after the unprecedented pressures on hospitals during the pandemic there is growing sympathy for health workers. There will be a difficult few months ahead as the pay review body considers the arguments and ministers decide on their next steps. With schools in England due to reopen to all pupils on Monday, experts will be watching to see the impact on the R number - which measures the virus's ability to spread. R is the number of people that one infected person will pass on the virus to, on average. The latest R estimate for the whole of the UK, from the government's scientific advisory group, Sage, is between 0.7 and 0.9 - meaning that, on average, every 10 people with Covid will infect between seven and nine other people. If the R value is higher than one, then the number of cases keeps increasing. You can read more about the R numberhere. Silvia Kirkham, who works for the gastroenterology unit at
Poole Hospital in Dorset, said she was ""disappointed by not entirely surprised"" by the proposed 1% pay rise for NHS workers, which she described as ""unjust"". She looks after people with chronic illnesses like Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis and said most of her patient appointments had become telephone calls since the pandemic. ""With the pandemic, anxiety levels have gone up among us and
among patients, who are taking immunity suppressants,"" she told the BBC. ""The sheer volume
of work has gone up. I've gone in weekends to make up."" She added: ""[The 1% pay rise]
will change nothing to do with my work ethic. You need to pay your bills, but
we're doing the job for the service of the people. More than 1,000 people came forward on the first day of local surge testing in Stockton in north-east England after a Covid variant from South Africa was discovered there. Anyone over the age of 16 who lives in the TS19 postcode area is being urged to get tested - even if they do not have symptoms. Stockton Council said cases of the more infectious variant needed to be identified ""as quickly as possible"". Council leader Bob Cook said there had been ""a great response"". ""I'd like to thank everyone who has come forward to get a test so far,"" he said. ""The more cases we find, the better chance we have of suppressing this variant."" You can read more about the Stockton variant testinghere. A leading scientist has urged parents dropping off their children at school from Monday to keep following social distancing as the next few weeks ""are going to be crucial"" in keeping infection rates down. Dr
Mike Tildesley, a
member of the government's SPI-M modelling advisory group, told Times Radio it was ""possible"" to keep theR numberbelow one with schools open, but people must continue to follow the rules. ""Just because you're not in the home with your young
children, don't use it as an excuse to go out and mix with other people that you
otherwise wouldn't have done,"" he added. Dr Tildesley said he would have preferred primary
pupils to return to school first ""and maybe a slight delay for secondary
school children going back"". However, he said the impact of vaccinations on infection rates ""hopefully is yet to come"", with current falls most likely due to lockdown measures. An NHS nurse has told the BBC that the government's plans for a below-inflation pay rise of 1% for him and his colleagues has left him feeling ""really betrayed"" after a year in which hospitals have been stretched by the pandemic. Martin Endersby, who works at Pinderfields Hospital in Wakefield, West Yorkshire, said: ""I work in a spinal rehabilitation unit. (On) the ward, we're not
supposed to come into contact with Covid patients, but we do. ""The government encouraged work-from-home schemes so the
general public had a great summer at home last year, with families on full pay. And a furlough scheme that payed people to stay at home - which the public
flouted and didnât follow the rules, whilst NHS staff worked tirelessly to keep
them safe. ""And what did we get? A further pay cut! ""It's been a kick in the teeth. When this all started, we
thought we would get the recognition for what we do. ""And my concern is if weâre forced to strike to get what we deserve, we
will become the villains.""   As we've reported, secondary students will be tested using lateral flow tests when schools in England reopen on Monday. Here's how one school has set up a rapid testing site as it prepares to welcome pupils back to the classroom. This video can not be played You can read more about how testing will work in schoolshere. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent To reduce the risk of spread of the virus, the government has introduced mass testing, with all secondary school pupils offered three tests on their return before being asked to carry them out twice a week at home. These will be rapid lateral flow tests that provide a quick result on the spot, unlike the ones that are carried out in official testing centres - known as PCR tests - that are sent off to labs. The rapid tests are less accurate - they may pick up only between half to three-quarters of positive cases, but given they are being used to spot cases before people develop symptoms or for those who do not develop symptoms, the government is adamant they have an important role. The problem is they can result in a false positive, telling people they are infected when they are not. Research suggests this happens one to three times for every 1,000 tests carried out. One safeguard would be to get anyone who tests positive to then take a PCR test to confirm it. This is being done for tests that are done in people's homes, but not for those carried out in school. Assuming most pupils take up the option of the tests, that could result in thousands of pupils and their close contacts being asked to isolate unnecessarily. That may be a price worth paying if it was spotting many more positives, but the testing done in schools in recent weeks, of pupils and staff who have been attending, shows the number testing positive is now at the lower estimate for the false positivity rate. NHS workers deserve a higher pay rise thanthe 1% proposed by the governmentafter an ""exceptional year"", a senior Conservative MP has said. Sir Roger Gale told the BBC: ""The government indicated clearly that it wanted to reward
the people who have given so much in the health service and a 1% increase which
will be swallowed up effectively by inflation, I donât think is a reward.â However, Gale added that he did not support the position of the unions, with the Royal College of Nursing preparing for strike action and calling for a 12.5% pay rise. He argued this demand was ""unrealistic in the present economic climate"" and strike action ""under these circumstances is unwarranted"". Large numbers of staff could leave nursing when the pandemic is over after being offered a 1% pay rise, the Royal College of Nursing has warned. Patricia Marquis, south-east regional director for the union, told Times Radio it made staff in England feel they were not valued and would worsen the NHS's recruitment issues. She said there were 40,000 nursing vacancies when the pandemic began and there was a ""real risk"" of more experienced staff leaving. But the government has defended its proposal, saying public finances are under unprecedented strain. Read more. Cyprus says it hopes to welcome British tourists who have been vaccinated twice against Covid from May - the month when travel restrictions could be lifted in the UK. But it is unclear how the Mediterranean island will expect people to prove their vaccination status. Foreign travel from the UK is currently banned unless it is for exceptional reasons. The earliest date people in England will be allowed to go abroad for holidays is 17 May, after a review of travel rules takes place. Portugal - like Cyprus a very popular holiday destination for Britons - has also said vaccinated British tourists will be able to visit - as will those who have tested negative or are ""immune"". Again, how people will be expected to prove this remains unclear. Portugal is currently on the UK's red list of high-risk Covid countries - meaning British or Irish citizens and UK residents coming to the UK from there have to quarantine in hotels when they arrive.

"Holly hadn't expected difficulties with EWS1 NHS worker Holly Ciesielczuk bought 75% of her first-floor flat in Redbridge in March 2019, under shared ownership. But when she tried to borrow more money to increase her share of ownership a year later, she hit a stumbling block. Following their initial survey, her mortgage lender requested an EWS1 form, which can be obtained following an assessment of a building's external walls. These were first developed to assess the potential financial impact of cladding on high-rise flats, after 72 people died at Grenfell Tower. To begin with, only those who owned flats in tall buildings with dangerous flammable cladding were affected. But after the government extended its advice to smaller properties in January 2020, mortgage lenders began demanding fire surveys from a much wider range of sellers.

However, she says her housing association would not agree to an EWS1 because, it said, the building was not high enough to meet the criteria.

Like an autograph on a baseball card, the NFT itself is the creator's autograph on the content, making it scarce, unique, and valuable."" Tweets are the latest digital assets to be monetised through so-called non-fungible tokens. NFTs use the blockchain, the same distributed database technology underlying Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, to create unique certificates of ownership of any kind of digital goods. While the idea that digital artists can earn an income by offering buyers some sense of ownership has its attractions, the ""sale"" of tweets will leave many scratching their heads. Valuables, the platform marketing Mr Dorsey's tweet, seems to recognise that the concept will leave people bemused. In its FAQ it explains ""owning any digital content can... hold sentimental value and create a relationship between collector and creator"". Most of us might think that this is a high price to pay for a relationship with the Twitter boss. But given the feverish and often irrational state of any kind of cryptocurrency related market, maybe the buyer is betting there'll be someone along soon to take the tweet off their hands at an even higher price. Meanwhile, on the basis that if you can't beat them, join them, I put one of my tweets up for sale. It was about this story - and I've just accepted a bid of $1.  That might sound modest but seeing as I've got 72,466 other tweets available it could be the start of something bigâ¦. Old offers for Mr Dorsey's tweet suggest that it was first put up for sale in December, but the listing gained more attention after he tweeted a link to it on Friday. That tweet has since been shared thousands of times. Within minutes of the tweet being posted, bids reached more than $88,000. But they skyrocketed on Saturday, with a bid of $1.5m being usurped by a $2m offer at around 15:30 GMT. According to Valuables by Cent's terms, 95% of a tweet's sale will go to the original creator with the remainder going to the website.

"Holly hadn't expected difficulties with EWS1 NHS worker Holly Ciesielczuk bought 75% of her first-floor flat in Redbridge in March 2019, under shared ownership. But when she tried to borrow more money to increase her share of ownership a year later, she hit a stumbling block. Following their initial survey, her mortgage lender requested an EWS1 form, which can be obtained following an assessment of a building's external walls. These were first developed to assess the potential financial impact of cladding on high-rise flats, after 72 people died at Grenfell Tower. To begin with, only those who owned flats in tall buildings with dangerous flammable cladding were affected. But after the government extended its advice to smaller properties in January 2020, mortgage lenders began demanding fire surveys from a much wider range of sellers. The reason Holly was given by her lender for requesting one was that a balcony on the building had a wooden floor. However, she says her housing association would not agree to an EWS1 because, it said, the building was not high enough to meet the criteria. The lender refused a mortgage without it, as did the next bank she tried. The combination of this and her partner's cancer diagnosis took its toll. ""I properly broke down. If I knew how much stress this was going to cause, I would never have bought my flat,"" she told the BBC. In November, the government said an agreement had been reached with the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS), banking trade body UK Finance and the Building Societies Association. It said this meant owners of flats in buildings without cladding would no longer need the form to sell or remortgage. But mortgage lenders said they ""did not consent"" to the announcement. Problems are still being encountered - including by Holly. When she contacted her lender after the November announcement, their position had not altered. ""I was so hopeful, so excited - but then so dismayed when I was told, 'You still need an EWS1 form.'"" Following a consultation on the requirement for EWS1 checks, RICS plans to release updated guidance. It's understood this could be published as soon as next week. It will be aimed at narrowing down the number of EWS1 requests, but there's no obligation for lenders to follow it. ""Naively or optimistically, I hope the guidance will provide clarity about whether I will be able to get a mortgage,"" Holly says. Alex hasn't been able to buy his first home Even when building management agree to having checks done, it can be a lengthy process. Alex Cross from Berkshire was excited to find what he thought was his ""perfect"" first flat, yet he too has been held up. When he was asked to obtain an EWS1 form to secure a mortgage, the property management company refused to help. They said they owned 4,000 blocks, but only 48 inspections had been booked that financial year. ""At that rate, it would take decades to obtain the required information,"" Alex points out. He eventually found one bank that did not require the full survey, but asked a set of questions about the building's safety, which the property developer would not answer. Rebecca Frisina and her family were hoping to move to a larger property, but have been unable to sell their flat. Although they have found a buyer, the mortgage provider has requested a EWS1 form for their property. The management company which owns the freehold eventually agreed to pursue the safety checks. However, it isn't clear when they might take place. Rebecca's family are now living with her parents and their buyer has moved into rented accommodation. ""We have asked for a rough estimated timeline and they have refused to answer us,"" she says. ""It's been a nightmare."" Rebecca's family had to move in with her parents Andrew Montlake is managing director of mortgage broker Coreco and chairman of the Association of Mortgage Intermediaries. He says one of the first things his team now ask about a property is whether there is cladding and whether an EWS1 has been produced. ""There are cases I'm sure where the buildings are probably OK. However, where you're dealing with such a serious subject, surely it's better to be safe than sorry. If the valuers aren't sure, they're going to cover themselves ""If there's a risk of a leaseholder having to pay repair bills in future, that could have an impact on affordability."" UK Finance also pointed out that some buildings might have cladding that is not obvious. The fee for an EWS1 survey can be up to Â£50,000, depending on the size and style of the property. It's estimated that there are only 300 chartered fire engineers in the UK who can carry out the survey, which is believed to be a cause of delays. A social media campaign, #EndOurCladdingScandal, has attracted support from a wide range of homeowners, including those subject to EWS1 requirements. ""RICS and the government can offer as much guidance as they want, but the truth is the genie is out of the bottle - and mortgage lenders are spooked,"" a spokesperson for the campaign said. The Ministry for Housing, Communities and Local Government said in a statement: ""The EWS1 is not a government form, nor a legal requirement, and we're disappointed this is being asked for in some cases where it's not needed. ""If a form is genuinely needed, we are providing Â£700,000 of funding to train up to 2,000 more surveyors to speed up the process and get through the backlog.""

""It almost felt we had won the game at half-time and if you have that mentality you get punished in this league. ""As a team everyone dropped our level 5% and that is too much combined against a team like Leicester who are fighting for the Champions League and were clinical when they got their chances.

Brighton 1-2 Leicester Brighton & Hove Albion Brighton boss Graham Potter speaking to Sky Sports:""We are suffering. I thought the performance deserved something from the game. In the first half we played well, in the second half not as well. ""Over the course of the game I felt we just missed too many passes to get any sustained pressure and be really ourselves. ""You expect them to respond and push for an equaliser which is normal but whenever we got the ball we gave it away too cheaply and we were under more pressure. ""We had an opportunity in attack and turned it over and they score. We responded quite well but then it was a disappointment at the end to concede in the manner we did. ""I haven't seen it back. He made a wonderful save in the first half and you can see his quality but if it is [Robert Sanchez's] it is not the reason we lost. ""We are where we are in the league. We know we are in a fight, we know we have to perform and be at our best. You need a bit of luck and today we didn't earn as much as we should have."" BBC One Match of the Day has started. Turn on BBC One orclick this link. Brighton 1-2 Leicester Leicester City Leicester City manager Brendan Rodgers speaking to Sky
Sports:âVery important [win]. We were
playing a good side. First half we didnât press the game well enough and we
didnât pass it well. âSo we had to ask a question at half-time and in the second
half I thought we were brilliant. The tempo of the game was better and we
stopped them playing and showed our quality. âWe have to deal with it [injuries]. You only have to look
at the bench we have some young players which is okay because we love young
players but some of them arenât playing regular in the under-23s. ""But still, I expect us to be better. We werenât aggressive
enough. Brighton are a very good side and if you give them time to play they can
play and they manipulate the ball well. So we deserved to be behind. âIn the second half the speed, tempo and movement was better
and we scored a very good goal and got the goal from the corner at the end."" On Kelechi Iheanacho and Jamie Vardy:âIt was a great finish
[from Iheanacho] and he is working very hard. Jamie is amazing for us. He is
such a threat. With all the injuries we are tying to get as many attacking
players on the pitch as we can. Delighted for the players but there are one or
two things we can look at."" Brighton 1-2 Leicester Brighton & Hove Albion Brighton manager Graham Potter to BBC Sport:""It feels sore. I thought overall our performance - certainly the first half - was good. We were close to getting a second. ""In the second half, Leicester responded and we didn't play as well. Still we had some opportunities but it felt like a draw might have been the right result. ""There was no problem with the approach and intention of the team. That was good. We made a few too many errors against a team going for the Champions League. While I didn't think we were bad, I didn't think we were really good. ""The goal at the end is a bit of a blow. ""Adam Lallana did some really nice touches, nice combinations. He helped the team, kept us going. He was a positive for us. ""We gave up the opportunity too often with the ball, turned it over too cheaply. When you do that against a good side you get pushed back more than you'd like. ""There's lots of football to play, lots of fighing to do. We have to pick ourselves up and go again for Southamptom. There's no other way."" Brighton 1-2 Leicester No side have won fewer home points in the Premier
League than Brighton this season (10), while Leicester have won four more on
the road than any other side so far this term (34). Brighton 1-2 Leicester Leicester City Leicester City boss Brendan Rodgers to BBC MOTD:""Brighton were better than us in the first half - we were too slow and not aggressive enough. They deservedly went in front. ""We had to look at things at half-time. We are much better than we showed in the first half. We were outstanding in the second half. ""They were excellent, they are a good side. You can see why they beat top teams. ""Once we got to grips with it in the second half... the players were brilliant in the second half. It was a change of mindset, we needed to be more aggressive. Once we did that we had more energy on the ball."" On Sidnei Tavares: ""We're obviously thin on the ground with attacking players. Sidnei Tavares was excellent. Technically he's very good. I felt we needed that player who can take the ball and pass it forward. It was a nice 70 minutes for him. He's a talent. He needs to get more physical in the game. He loves the ball, that's the type of player I like. He nearly scored a great goal. There's a great opportunity here for him if he contines to work and keeps his head down and doesn't get carried away."" On no midweek game: ""I think it allows us to get onto the coaching field again. It's the first free week I can remember in a long time. We can get some coaching into the players. The mentality has been incredible - to be up there challenging with 10 games to go. "" Brighton 1-2 Leicester Leicester have faced Brighton more often in the
Premier League without losing than they have any other opponent (8 games â W6 D2). Brighton 1-2 Leicester Brighton have dropped 17 points from winning positions
in the Premier League this season. Only Southampton (18) have dropped more. Brighton 1-2 Leicester Brighton & Hove Albion Brighton goalscorer Adam Lallana to Sky Sports:""Second half we were poor. It almost felt like we'd won the game at half-time. If you drop your levels you get punished. ""There have been games we've felt hard done by but today doesn't feel like that. We didn't perform well enough in the second half. ""We've proven we can get results against big teams. We all dropped off a couple of percent. We were too passive and we got punished. ""It's always nice to go one up at home. We had a couple more chances. But you can't rest on your laurels. ""I don't remember them creating too much. The poor keeper at the end just got caught under the ball but he's been tremendous for us. He'll learn and he'll bounce back."" Brighton 1-2 Leicester Leicester City Leicester City midfielder Youri Tielemans speaking to Sky Sports:""The first half was not good enough at all. It was not
diffcult to do better in the second half. It wasn't good. ""We had a good reaction and now we
have to recover for next week and we have to start better. ""We were a bit loose out of possession and they got onto us very quickly. We didnât react positively in duels and were not quick enough with the ball. It was a bit of everything. ""Credit to him [Kelechi Iheanacho] for the finish and we score in the end from a
set-piece. We are very happy with a win. We need to try and make up for the guys who are not there and tonight we did it in the second half. ""It feels like a very big result. You could see they played good football, scored early in the game so it
was up to us to react to that."" Match of the Day starts at 22:20 GMT on BBC One and this website Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"England's pubs have been deluged by people eager to book space from when beer gardens reopen on 12 April, industry group UK Hospitality has said. From that date, pubs are expected to be able to serve customers sitting outdoors. One Leeds pub reported that it had taken in 700 bookings in just five hours this week. Demand has been so high that scammers have even taken to advertising fake pub bookings. Pubs in most of the UK have been closed to sit-in customers during the latest lockdown, creating pent-up demand. ""Our members that can open outdoor areas have reported strong interest from customers, which is not surprising after such a long period of closure,"" said Kate Nicholls, chief executive of UK Hospitality. During the most recent lockdown, pubs in England have been allowed to serve takeaway food and non-alcoholic drinks until 23:00 GMT, but not takeaway alcohol. Pubs have been closed to customers wishing to sit in throughout the UK. In Scotland, alcohol cannot currently be sold for outdoor consumption, while venues are closed on the mainland except for takeaways picked up outside the premises, although they are open on some of the islands. Hospitality venues on the mainland are set to reopen from about 26 April. In Wales, pubs can sell takeaway drinks if licensed, and in Northern Ireland, takeaway off-sales must stop at 20:00 GMT. Covid: When can pubs and restaurants reopen? When the Water Lane Boathouse pub in Leeds announced on Wednesday that bookings were open, it had more than 700 in just five hours.

""We're almost fully booked for the first week of opening and have already got about 2,500 people booked in for the first two weeks, even though we haven't gone out to tell customers,"" says pub owner Tim Foster, who runs the four-strong Yummy Pubs chain. ""They've all come from inquiries, people asking when we'll be open and if they can book."" The pub used the time after the first lockdown to boost its outdoor area and double the capacity. ""We're now capable of seating 230 outside, or 160 with social distancing, but we'll limit bookings to around 50% capacity for the first couple of weeks to help us and our customers get used to it,"" Mr Foster said. Pubs will be helped by not having to keep to a 22:00 curfew, as they were last time they were allowed to open, but bookings are coming in at a high level for every day, he said. ""We'll be full every day, not just the weekends. There's a huge pent-up demand - people are desperate to get out of their houses."" Other pub chains have reported an uplift in bookings. ""We experienced a 300% spike in bookings when the roadmap was announced,"" said Zoe Cooper, senior marketing executive at the Inn Collection Group, which has 15 pubs in north-eastern and north-western England. ""We're looking forward to welcoming guests back."" A spokesperson for Fuller Smith & Turner, which runs about 400 pubs around the country, said: ""People are clearly keen to get back to the pub and where we are opening our gardens and patios on 12 April, we've seen a high number of people pre-booking their tables. ""We just can't wait to welcome our customers back into our pubs. It's been a long time coming."" Mitchells & Butlers owns a number of national pub chains, including All Bar One, Browns, Castle and Harvester. It said it would open 250-300 pubs in England on 12 April, and about 100 more from the Bank Holiday weekend at the end of the month. ""In pubs which do reopen, we'll be encouraging customers to use apps to both pre-book and then to order from their table,"" a spokesperson said. Last month, Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced that he hoped that hospitality venues could reopen from 12 April for outdoor service only. The reopenings depend on how the pandemic progresses in the next few weeks. But if all goes as planned, people will be able to meet friends or family in beer gardens or to eat dinner outside as a group of six or a mixture of two households. ""Bookings will not be mandatory, although lots of venues will probably implement a booking system,"" said UK Hospitality's Ms Nicholls. ""Businesses will have their own systems in place for managing high demand, processing bookings and ensuring high levels of safety are met."" One chain where you won't need to book is Wetherspoons. It said this week it would reopen 394 of its 750 England pubs with outdoor spaces, including beer gardens, rooftops gardens and patios. But the pub reopenings on 12 April are only a small part of the industry, pointed out Ms Nicholls. ""April isn't going to represent a reopening of any significance, or a reopening at all, for much of the sector. We need to remember that nearly 60% of hospitality businesses don't have outdoor areas and many that do only have small spaces."" Pubs and restaurants will be given the green light to offer indoor seating from 17 May, providing specific Covid conditions are met. From that date, indoor parties can be made up of a maximum of six people or two households of any size, while groups seated outside must be smaller than 30 people. From 21 June, all restrictions could be lifted. What will pubs, cafes and gigs be like from 19 July? Will the UK's pubs stay shut until May?

"There are concerns pupils could be forced to isolate unnecessarily due to inaccurate Covid test results when schools reopen in England on Monday Mass testing using lateral flow devices is to be carried out in secondary schools Research suggests they can offer a false positive result between 1 and 3 times for every thousand carried out More unions have put pressure on the government to reconsider its planned 1% pay rise for NHS staff in England Hospital leaders in England back the demands, saying ministers previously budgeted for a pay rise of 2.1% Staff feel undervalued and many could leave nursing when the pandemic is over, the Royal College of Nursing warns The government has defended its proposal, saying public finances are under unprecedented strain A mystery person in the UK infected with the Covid variant of concern first found in Brazil is traced Rapid Covid testing is now available to all workplaces in England Edited by Holly Wallis That's it for our live coverage for today. It was brought to you by Holly Wallis, Becky Morton and Adrian Dalingwater. Here's a round-up of some of the latest developments in the UK and around the world:  The latest pandemic figures reported by the UK government show continuing falls in the number of cases and deaths. In the seven days up to 6 March, there were 42,826 new recorded infections, a drop of 22,018 (34%) on the number for the previous week. Over the same period, there were 1,542 deaths, a fall of 799 (34.1%) on the previous week.  The government has released the latest figures for coronavirus cases and deaths in the UK. There have been6,040new cases since the last tally was published on Friday, and a further158deaths. Both figures appear to confirm the steadily  decreasing level of cases and fatalities reported in recent weeks. In terms of vaccinations,21,796,278people had been given a first dose and1,090,840people had been given a second dose by the end of Friday. Thousands gathered inside Sydney cricket ground on Saturday for the city's annual Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras celebration. Revellers usually line the city's streets for a huge parade but plans were altered this year because of the pandemic. Some 36,000 attended the stadium event instead - though a small protest march also took place on the usual parade route after an exemption was issued by health officials. Around 5,000 people also took part in a parade, which for 2021 was themed ""Rise"", chosen ""after the challenge and hardship"" of the last year. While gatherings of thousands are unthinkable in much of the world right now, the state of New South Wales has gone 48 days without local coronavirus transmission. Australia has only recorded about 29,000 cases and 900 deaths throughout the whole pandemic. You can see more picture from the celebrationshere. The priority list for the coronavirus vaccine in the UK is set by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation and is primarily in order of age. However, health and social care workers, as well as younger people who are clinically vulnerable are also being prioritised. Between now and the 15 April, the government is aiming to offer everyone over 50, as well as all over-16s with an underlying health condition and unpaid carers for the elderly and disabled, a first jab. There is a target of offering a first dose to everyone over the age of 18 by the end of July. You can read more about the vaccine rollouthere. Some Rangers fans have gathered outside Ibrox Stadium in Glasgow despite coronavirus lockdown rules. Images posted on social media showed flares being set off and fans singing ahead of Rangers' game against St Mirren. No one has been arrested. Under the current restrictions in Scotland public gatherings are banned and a maximum of two people from two households are allowed to meet outdoors. Football games are taking place behind closed doors with no fans in the stadium. Read more. Since 8 December about 18 million people have received at least one dose of a coronavirus vaccine in England. This covers about 38% of the population over the age of 16, according to NHS England figures. Of England's 314 local authorities, NHS data suggestsTendringin Essex vaccinated the highest percentage of its estimated population, as of 28 February, at 51%. Tower Hamletsin London vaccinated the lowest, at 14%. You can read more about how the rollout varies across the country - and the possible reasons behind this -here. Hugh PymBBC News Health Editor The NHS pay row in England, fuelled by angry responses from health unions, rumbles on and seems unlikely to fade away. It is significant that the employers have now entered the fray in the shape of NHS Providers, the group representing hospitals and other trusts in England. NHS trust leaders know only too well that morale is low among an exhausted workforce and they fear that the proposed wage rise will make things worse. They are in effect lining up with the unions to oppose the government. Ministers argue that the pandemic changed everything, including the state of the public finances, and that earlier plans have had to be rethought. They say that compared to other parts of the public workforce facing a pay freeze, the NHS workforce will fare better and that difficult measures were needed to respond to public borrowing increases. But after the unprecedented pressures on hospitals during the pandemic there is growing sympathy for health workers. There will be a difficult few months ahead as the pay review body considers the arguments and ministers decide on their next steps. With schools in England due to reopen to all pupils on Monday, experts will be watching to see the impact on the R number - which measures the virus's ability to spread. R is the number of people that one infected person will pass on the virus to, on average. The latest R estimate for the whole of the UK, from the government's scientific advisory group, Sage, is between 0.7 and 0.9 - meaning that, on average, every 10 people with Covid will infect between seven and nine other people. If the R value is higher than one, then the number of cases keeps increasing. You can read more about the R numberhere. Silvia Kirkham, who works for the gastroenterology unit at
Poole Hospital in Dorset, said she was ""disappointed by not entirely surprised"" by the proposed 1% pay rise for NHS workers, which she described as ""unjust"". She looks after people with chronic illnesses like Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis and said most of her patient appointments had become telephone calls since the pandemic. ""With the pandemic, anxiety levels have gone up among us and
among patients, who are taking immunity suppressants,"" she told the BBC. ""The sheer volume
of work has gone up. I've gone in weekends to make up."" She added: ""[The 1% pay rise]
will change nothing to do with my work ethic. You need to pay your bills, but
we're doing the job for the service of the people. More than 1,000 people came forward on the first day of local surge testing in Stockton in north-east England after a Covid variant from South Africa was discovered there. Anyone over the age of 16 who lives in the TS19 postcode area is being urged to get tested - even if they do not have symptoms. Stockton Council said cases of the more infectious variant needed to be identified ""as quickly as possible"". Council leader Bob Cook said there had been ""a great response"". ""I'd like to thank everyone who has come forward to get a test so far,"" he said. ""The more cases we find, the better chance we have of suppressing this variant."" You can read more about the Stockton variant testinghere. A leading scientist has urged parents dropping off their children at school from Monday to keep following social distancing as the next few weeks ""are going to be crucial"" in keeping infection rates down. Dr
Mike Tildesley, a
member of the government's SPI-M modelling advisory group, told Times Radio it was ""possible"" to keep theR numberbelow one with schools open, but people must continue to follow the rules. ""Just because you're not in the home with your young
children, don't use it as an excuse to go out and mix with other people that you
otherwise wouldn't have done,"" he added. Dr Tildesley said he would have preferred primary
pupils to return to school first ""and maybe a slight delay for secondary
school children going back"". However, he said the impact of vaccinations on infection rates ""hopefully is yet to come"", with current falls most likely due to lockdown measures. An NHS nurse has told the BBC that the government's plans for a below-inflation pay rise of 1% for him and his colleagues has left him feeling ""really betrayed"" after a year in which hospitals have been stretched by the pandemic. Martin Endersby, who works at Pinderfields Hospital in Wakefield, West Yorkshire, said: ""I work in a spinal rehabilitation unit. (On) the ward, we're not
supposed to come into contact with Covid patients, but we do. ""The government encouraged work-from-home schemes so the
general public had a great summer at home last year, with families on full pay. And a furlough scheme that payed people to stay at home - which the public
flouted and didnât follow the rules, whilst NHS staff worked tirelessly to keep
them safe. ""And what did we get? A further pay cut! ""It's been a kick in the teeth. When this all started, we
thought we would get the recognition for what we do. ""And my concern is if weâre forced to strike to get what we deserve, we
will become the villains.""   As we've reported, secondary students will be tested using lateral flow tests when schools in England reopen on Monday. Here's how one school has set up a rapid testing site as it prepares to welcome pupils back to the classroom. This video can not be played You can read more about how testing will work in schoolshere. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent To reduce the risk of spread of the virus, the government has introduced mass testing, with all secondary school pupils offered three tests on their return before being asked to carry them out twice a week at home. These will be rapid lateral flow tests that provide a quick result on the spot, unlike the ones that are carried out in official testing centres - known as PCR tests - that are sent off to labs. The rapid tests are less accurate - they may pick up only between half to three-quarters of positive cases, but given they are being used to spot cases before people develop symptoms or for those who do not develop symptoms, the government is adamant they have an important role. The problem is they can result in a false positive, telling people they are infected when they are not. Research suggests this happens one to three times for every 1,000 tests carried out. One safeguard would be to get anyone who tests positive to then take a PCR test to confirm it. This is being done for tests that are done in people's homes, but not for those carried out in school. Assuming most pupils take up the option of the tests, that could result in thousands of pupils and their close contacts being asked to isolate unnecessarily. That may be a price worth paying if it was spotting many more positives, but the testing done in schools in recent weeks, of pupils and staff who have been attending, shows the number testing positive is now at the lower estimate for the false positivity rate. NHS workers deserve a higher pay rise thanthe 1% proposed by the governmentafter an ""exceptional year"", a senior Conservative MP has said. Sir Roger Gale told the BBC: ""The government indicated clearly that it wanted to reward
the people who have given so much in the health service and a 1% increase which
will be swallowed up effectively by inflation, I donât think is a reward.â However, Gale added that he did not support the position of the unions, with the Royal College of Nursing preparing for strike action and calling for a 12.5% pay rise. He argued this demand was ""unrealistic in the present economic climate"" and strike action ""under these circumstances is unwarranted"". Large numbers of staff could leave nursing when the pandemic is over after being offered a 1% pay rise, the Royal College of Nursing has warned. Patricia Marquis, south-east regional director for the union, told Times Radio it made staff in England feel they were not valued and would worsen the NHS's recruitment issues. She said there were 40,000 nursing vacancies when the pandemic began and there was a ""real risk"" of more experienced staff leaving. But the government has defended its proposal, saying public finances are under unprecedented strain. Read more. Cyprus says it hopes to welcome British tourists who have been vaccinated twice against Covid from May - the month when travel restrictions could be lifted in the UK. But it is unclear how the Mediterranean island will expect people to prove their vaccination status. Foreign travel from the UK is currently banned unless it is for exceptional reasons. The earliest date people in England will be allowed to go abroad for holidays is 17 May, after a review of travel rules takes place. Portugal - like Cyprus a very popular holiday destination for Britons - has also said vaccinated British tourists will be able to visit - as will those who have tested negative or are ""immune"". Again, how people will be expected to prove this remains unclear. Portugal is currently on the UK's red list of high-risk Covid countries - meaning British or Irish citizens and UK residents coming to the UK from there have to quarantine in hotels when they arrive.

That may be a price worth paying if it was spotting many more positives, but the testing done in schools in recent weeks, of pupils and staff who have been attending, shows the number testing positive is now at the lower estimate for the false positivity rate. Birmingham University biostatistician Prof Jon Deeks says given the low detection rates that are being seen it is ""absolutely clear"" many of those getting positive test results next week will be false positives. ""Any testing system is a trade-off between benefits and harms,"" he says. ""My concern is that it will actually cause more harm than good."" Concerns have been raised by the Royal Statistical Society, too. Prof Sheila Bird, a member of the society's Covid-19 Task Force, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme false positives were ""very likely"" and that every positive lateral flow test should have a PCR test to confirm it. How fresh air makes school safer 'No evidence' schools spread lots of Covid The devastating toll of the pandemic on children The second key change - and the most controversial - is the recommendation of masks in classes for secondary age schoolchildren. Previously pupils were just expected to wear them in communal areas, like corridors. Critics say it will harm learning and is unfair to expect children to wear masks for hours on end. But others have argued it is an absolute necessity and should have been introduced in primary schools too. The problem is the benefit of mask-wearing is difficult to quantify.Recent evidence from the government advisory group Sage,externalacknowledges this, although it says there is evidence that worn correctly they will have a ""small but significant"" impact on transmission by preventing the wearer from spreading the virus if they are unknowingly infected. This is mainly derived from lab experiments though, and much will depend on how they are used, it says. Will teenagers adhere to the best practice on mask-wearing for hours on end? It is for this reason some experts say they would have liked to see a proper trial in schools to measure the impact. ""We always do this for a medical intervention - there are lots of things that work in the lab but not in the real world,"" says Prof Jonathan Ball, a virologist at Nottingham University. ""But for some reason we don't do this with non-medical interventions. It would be complicated, but this would be the ideal opportunity to do it - and help us decide if they are useful or make matters worse."" Without a trial, the fear is it will be difficult for the government to stop the practice. If cases remain low, it could be argued masks have made the difference and if they creep up, the case could be made they would have gone up more without mask-wearing. The move could, in other words, open a can of worms. But it is a risk ministers seem happy to tackle. The government insists the use of masks is ""temporary and precautionary"" - and  will be reviewed at Easter. Or, in the words of one scientific adviser: ""We know it's not going to make much difference, but if it helps us get schools back, it's worth the hassle when it's dropped."" It is well-established that children are at incredibly low risk from the virus, while research by the Office for National Statistics has shown that teachers areat no higher risk of infection than other working-age people. What role will schools play in the wider spread of the virus though remains more open for debate. Children, after all, come home and mix with their families. Government advisers say schools have not been a key driver of infections so far. This much can be seen from the impact of the second national lockdown in England in November when infection levels fell despite schools being open. But this was before the new UK variant became dominant. Modelling has suggestedreopening schools now could be enough to drive the R number above one,external, which would lead to a growing epidemic. Ministers have already indicated this matters less than it used to because the vaccination programme has begun to break the link between infection rates and serious illness and death - the R number is not one of their tests for slowing the pace of lifting lockdown. Dr Muge Cevik, an infectious disease expert at the University of St Andrews, says it is impossible to disentangle exactly what impact schools have - although she says all the evidence suggests the school outbreaks that have happened have mainly been small. ""The evidence of harms of closing schools is clear. They should be open as default unless there is very strong evidence that closing them will have a significant impact on hospitalisations and mortality.""

"This video can not be played For some of the most deprived areas in England, January was the deadliest month since the pandemic began. One town that has suffered greatly is Burnley in Lancashire. New ONS figures show deaths in the town from Covid-19 and all other causes were higher in January than the peak of the first wave in April 2020. New Analysis for the BBC from the University of Manchester shows that in January the Covid mortality rate in Burnley was more than double the English average, and deaths from all causes were 60 per cent higher than the English average. The government says it is committed to reducing deprivation and has spent over Â£100bn on welfare support during Covid and is supporting local councils.

"Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Saturday morning. We'll have another update for you tomorrow morning. A growing number of unions are criticising the government over its planned 1% pay rise for NHS workers in England. The British Medical Association and other unions say their staff""have literally kept the country alive for the past year"". Health Secretary Matt Hancockhas defended the increase,saying it is what the government thinks is ""affordable"". During the first lockdown, the government encouraged people to pay tribute to healthcare workers by clapping There are concerns that thousands of pupils could be forced to isolate unnecessarily because of inaccurate results from mass testing at secondary schools when they reopen in England from next week. The lateral flow tests that will be used are less accurate than the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) technique used by official testing centres.So, how will measures introduced at schools help? And how much does it matter if infection rates go up? From 12 April, pubs in England are expected to be able to start serving customers sitting outdoors.This has sparked a rush for bookings, with one Leeds pub taking 700 reservations in just five hours. Meanwhile, one regular says he owes a local landlord a ""debt of gratitude""after joining his bubble during lockdown. In January, the Covid mortality rate in Burnley, Lancashire, was more than double the English average. For some families, they are not only having to cope with bereavement,but also the financial costs that come with burying a loved one. Ed Thomas went to meet some of the families who are struggling.

"This video can not be played A member of staff delivered the snack to the helicopter pilot A helicopter pilot's 80-mile round trip to pick up a beef sandwich from a farm shop was a ""flagrant abuse"" of lockdown rules, a councillor has said. A video posted online on Tuesday showed the man landing for his ""roast beef in gravy barm with caramelised onion"" at Chipping Farm Shop near Preston. A flight radar website tracked the helicopter to the shop from City Airport in Salford. Ribble Valley council is investigating a possible Covid rule breach. The pilot and farm shop have been contacted for comment. A videoposted by the shop on Instagram,externalshowed the helicopter landing nearby and a member of staff delivering the sandwich to the pilot. The post included a comment from the shop about what happens ""when your customers are literally flying in for your roast beef in caramelised onion gravy barms"". The shop has since deleted its account on Facebook, which had also posted videos of the helicopter's arrival. A local resident, who has asked not to be named, said he tracked the helicopter online and had seen it travel from Salford to the shop, which was not connected to a farm, and back again. He told the BBC the shop served ""takeaway drinks and snacks to the many cyclists who come here [and] earlier this week there were 20 plus of them and a helicopter for the second day running"". Simon Hore, who represents the Chipping ward on Ribble Valley Borough Council, said the helicopter trip ""does seem to be a flagrant abuse of the restrictions on travel under the current lockdown rules"".

It was brought to you by Holly Wallis, Becky Morton and Adrian Dalingwater. Here's a round-up of some of the latest developments in the UK and around the world:  The latest pandemic figures reported by the UK government show continuing falls in the number of cases and deaths. In the seven days up to 6 March, there were 42,826 new recorded infections, a drop of 22,018 (34%) on the number for the previous week. Over the same period, there were 1,542 deaths, a fall of 799 (34.1%) on the previous week.  The government has released the latest figures for coronavirus cases and deaths in the UK. There have been6,040new cases since the last tally was published on Friday, and a further158deaths. Both figures appear to confirm the steadily  decreasing level of cases and fatalities reported in recent weeks. In terms of vaccinations,21,796,278people had been given a first dose and1,090,840people had been given a second dose by the end of Friday. Thousands gathered inside Sydney cricket ground on Saturday for the city's annual Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras celebration. Revellers usually line the city's streets for a huge parade but plans were altered this year because of the pandemic. Some 36,000 attended the stadium event instead - though a small protest march also took place on the usual parade route after an exemption was issued by health officials. Around 5,000 people also took part in a parade, which for 2021 was themed ""Rise"", chosen ""after the challenge and hardship"" of the last year. While gatherings of thousands are unthinkable in much of the world right now, the state of New South Wales has gone 48 days without local coronavirus transmission. Australia has only recorded about 29,000 cases and 900 deaths throughout the whole pandemic. You can see more picture from the celebrationshere. The priority list for the coronavirus vaccine in the UK is set by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation and is primarily in order of age. However, health and social care workers, as well as younger people who are clinically vulnerable are also being prioritised. Between now and the 15 April, the government is aiming to offer everyone over 50, as well as all over-16s with an underlying health condition and unpaid carers for the elderly and disabled, a first jab. There is a target of offering a first dose to everyone over the age of 18 by the end of July. You can read more about the vaccine rollouthere. Some Rangers fans have gathered outside Ibrox Stadium in Glasgow despite coronavirus lockdown rules. Images posted on social media showed flares being set off and fans singing ahead of Rangers' game against St Mirren. No one has been arrested. Under the current restrictions in Scotland public gatherings are banned and a maximum of two people from two households are allowed to meet outdoors. Football games are taking place behind closed doors with no fans in the stadium. Read more. Since 8 December about 18 million people have received at least one dose of a coronavirus vaccine in England. This covers about 38% of the population over the age of 16, according to NHS England figures. Of England's 314 local authorities, NHS data suggestsTendringin Essex vaccinated the highest percentage of its estimated population, as of 28 February, at 51%. Tower Hamletsin London vaccinated the lowest, at 14%. You can read more about how the rollout varies across the country - and the possible reasons behind this -here. Hugh PymBBC News Health Editor The NHS pay row in England, fuelled by angry responses from health unions, rumbles on and seems unlikely to fade away. It is significant that the employers have now entered the fray in the shape of NHS Providers, the group representing hospitals and other trusts in England. NHS trust leaders know only too well that morale is low among an exhausted workforce and they fear that the proposed wage rise will make things worse. They are in effect lining up with the unions to oppose the government. Ministers argue that the pandemic changed everything, including the state of the public finances, and that earlier plans have had to be rethought. They say that compared to other parts of the public workforce facing a pay freeze, the NHS workforce will fare better and that difficult measures were needed to respond to public borrowing increases. But after the unprecedented pressures on hospitals during the pandemic there is growing sympathy for health workers. There will be a difficult few months ahead as the pay review body considers the arguments and ministers decide on their next steps. With schools in England due to reopen to all pupils on Monday, experts will be watching to see the impact on the R number - which measures the virus's ability to spread. R is the number of people that one infected person will pass on the virus to, on average. The latest R estimate for the whole of the UK, from the government's scientific advisory group, Sage, is between 0.7 and 0.9 - meaning that, on average, every 10 people with Covid will infect between seven and nine other people. If the R value is higher than one, then the number of cases keeps increasing. You can read more about the R numberhere. Silvia Kirkham, who works for the gastroenterology unit at
Poole Hospital in Dorset, said she was ""disappointed by not entirely surprised"" by the proposed 1% pay rise for NHS workers, which she described as ""unjust"". She looks after people with chronic illnesses like Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis and said most of her patient appointments had become telephone calls since the pandemic. ""With the pandemic, anxiety levels have gone up among us and
among patients, who are taking immunity suppressants,"" she told the BBC. ""The sheer volume
of work has gone up. I've gone in weekends to make up."" She added: ""[The 1% pay rise]
will change nothing to do with my work ethic. You need to pay your bills, but
we're doing the job for the service of the people. More than 1,000 people came forward on the first day of local surge testing in Stockton in north-east England after a Covid variant from South Africa was discovered there. Anyone over the age of 16 who lives in the TS19 postcode area is being urged to get tested - even if they do not have symptoms. Stockton Council said cases of the more infectious variant needed to be identified ""as quickly as possible"". Council leader Bob Cook said there had been ""a great response"". ""I'd like to thank everyone who has come forward to get a test so far,"" he said. ""The more cases we find, the better chance we have of suppressing this variant."" You can read more about the Stockton variant testinghere. A leading scientist has urged parents dropping off their children at school from Monday to keep following social distancing as the next few weeks ""are going to be crucial"" in keeping infection rates down. Dr
Mike Tildesley, a
member of the government's SPI-M modelling advisory group, told Times Radio it was ""possible"" to keep theR numberbelow one with schools open, but people must continue to follow the rules. ""Just because you're not in the home with your young
children, don't use it as an excuse to go out and mix with other people that you
otherwise wouldn't have done,"" he added. Dr Tildesley said he would have preferred primary
pupils to return to school first ""and maybe a slight delay for secondary
school children going back"". However, he said the impact of vaccinations on infection rates ""hopefully is yet to come"", with current falls most likely due to lockdown measures. An NHS nurse has told the BBC that the government's plans for a below-inflation pay rise of 1% for him and his colleagues has left him feeling ""really betrayed"" after a year in which hospitals have been stretched by the pandemic. Martin Endersby, who works at Pinderfields Hospital in Wakefield, West Yorkshire, said: ""I work in a spinal rehabilitation unit. (On) the ward, we're not
supposed to come into contact with Covid patients, but we do. ""The government encouraged work-from-home schemes so the
general public had a great summer at home last year, with families on full pay. And a furlough scheme that payed people to stay at home - which the public
flouted and didnât follow the rules, whilst NHS staff worked tirelessly to keep
them safe. ""And what did we get? A further pay cut! ""It's been a kick in the teeth. When this all started, we
thought we would get the recognition for what we do. ""And my concern is if weâre forced to strike to get what we deserve, we
will become the villains.""   As we've reported, secondary students will be tested using lateral flow tests when schools in England reopen on Monday. Here's how one school has set up a rapid testing site as it prepares to welcome pupils back to the classroom. This video can not be played You can read more about how testing will work in schoolshere. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent To reduce the risk of spread of the virus, the government has introduced mass testing, with all secondary school pupils offered three tests on their return before being asked to carry them out twice a week at home. These will be rapid lateral flow tests that provide a quick result on the spot, unlike the ones that are carried out in official testing centres - known as PCR tests - that are sent off to labs. The rapid tests are less accurate - they may pick up only between half to three-quarters of positive cases, but given they are being used to spot cases before people develop symptoms or for those who do not develop symptoms, the government is adamant they have an important role. The problem is they can result in a false positive, telling people they are infected when they are not. Research suggests this happens one to three times for every 1,000 tests carried out. One safeguard would be to get anyone who tests positive to then take a PCR test to confirm it. This is being done for tests that are done in people's homes, but not for those carried out in school. Assuming most pupils take up the option of the tests, that could result in thousands of pupils and their close contacts being asked to isolate unnecessarily. That may be a price worth paying if it was spotting many more positives, but the testing done in schools in recent weeks, of pupils and staff who have been attending, shows the number testing positive is now at the lower estimate for the false positivity rate. NHS workers deserve a higher pay rise thanthe 1% proposed by the governmentafter an ""exceptional year"", a senior Conservative MP has said. Sir Roger Gale told the BBC: ""The government indicated clearly that it wanted to reward
the people who have given so much in the health service and a 1% increase which
will be swallowed up effectively by inflation, I donât think is a reward.â However, Gale added that he did not support the position of the unions, with the Royal College of Nursing preparing for strike action and calling for a 12.5% pay rise. He argued this demand was ""unrealistic in the present economic climate"" and strike action ""under these circumstances is unwarranted"". Large numbers of staff could leave nursing when the pandemic is over after being offered a 1% pay rise, the Royal College of Nursing has warned. Patricia Marquis, south-east regional director for the union, told Times Radio it made staff in England feel they were not valued and would worsen the NHS's recruitment issues. She said there were 40,000 nursing vacancies when the pandemic began and there was a ""real risk"" of more experienced staff leaving. But the government has defended its proposal, saying public finances are under unprecedented strain. Read more. Cyprus says it hopes to welcome British tourists who have been vaccinated twice against Covid from May - the month when travel restrictions could be lifted in the UK. But it is unclear how the Mediterranean island will expect people to prove their vaccination status. Foreign travel from the UK is currently banned unless it is for exceptional reasons. The earliest date people in England will be allowed to go abroad for holidays is 17 May, after a review of travel rules takes place. Portugal - like Cyprus a very popular holiday destination for Britons - has also said vaccinated British tourists will be able to visit - as will those who have tested negative or are ""immune"". Again, how people will be expected to prove this remains unclear. Portugal is currently on the UK's red list of high-risk Covid countries - meaning British or Irish citizens and UK residents coming to the UK from there have to quarantine in hotels when they arrive.

"Women and girls in England are being asked to share their experiences of the health system as part of a government strategy to address inequalities. Ministers say there is ""strong evidence"" services for female patients need improving. Fertility, maternity and menopause care are among the areas to be discussed. Campaigners say they are ""delighted"" steps are ""finally"" being taken to close the so-called ""gender health gap"". While women in the UK have a longer life expectancy than men, the Department for Health and Social Care says they are spending less of their life in good health. Nadine Dorries, minister for women's health, said: ""Women's experiences of healthcare can vary and we want to ensure women are able to access the treatment and services they need. ""It's crucial women's voices are at the front and centre of this strategy so we understand their experiences and how to improve their outcomes."" Studies suggest gender biases in clinical trials are a contributing factor. Endometriosis care 'needs urgent improvement' Young endometriosis sufferers told 'get pregnant' Lives ruined as damage seen as 'women's problems' Less is also said to be known about many female-specific conditions and how to treat them. Patients have repeatedly reported to the BBC that they have felt overlooked when talking to doctors about conditions like endometriosis or complications following a pelvic mesh repair. From Monday 8 March, the Women's Health Strategy will spend 12 weeks speaking to female patients about a wide range of issues including maternity care and mental health. The plan was due to launch last year, but had to be delayed because of the coronavirus pandemic. It is understood ministers hope to publish it when MPs return to Parliament after the summer break. Campaigners have welcomed the idea but say it's vital women are properly listened to and appropriate action taken. Gill Walton, chief executive of the Royal College of Midwives, said: ""We know that placing women at the centre of their own care not only improves outcomes in pregnancy, but also improves a woman's experience of birth and maternity care."" Mika Simmons, co-chair of the Ginsburg Women's Health Board, filmmaker, and host of The Happy Vagina podcast, said: ""Every single woman I speak to, myself included, has experienced either misunderstanding or loss as a direct result of slow or inaccurate diagnosis of their health concerns. ""I am delighted that this - the gender health gap - which grew out of a severe lack of  historical research into women's health issues, is not only finally being acknowledged but that steps are being taken to right size it.""

"There are concerns pupils could be forced to isolate unnecessarily due to inaccurate Covid test results when schools reopen in England on Monday Mass testing using lateral flow devices is to be carried out in secondary schools Research suggests they can offer a false positive result between 1 and 3 times for every thousand carried out More unions have put pressure on the government to reconsider its planned 1% pay rise for NHS staff in England Hospital leaders in England back the demands, saying ministers previously budgeted for a pay rise of 2.1% Staff feel undervalued and many could leave nursing when the pandemic is over, the Royal College of Nursing warns The government has defended its proposal, saying public finances are under unprecedented strain A mystery person in the UK infected with the Covid variant of concern first found in Brazil is traced Rapid Covid testing is now available to all workplaces in England Edited by Holly Wallis That's it for our live coverage for today. It was brought to you by Holly Wallis, Becky Morton and Adrian Dalingwater. Here's a round-up of some of the latest developments in the UK and around the world:  The latest pandemic figures reported by the UK government show continuing falls in the number of cases and deaths. In the seven days up to 6 March, there were 42,826 new recorded infections, a drop of 22,018 (34%) on the number for the previous week. Over the same period, there were 1,542 deaths, a fall of 799 (34.1%) on the previous week.  The government has released the latest figures for coronavirus cases and deaths in the UK. There have been6,040new cases since the last tally was published on Friday, and a further158deaths. Both figures appear to confirm the steadily  decreasing level of cases and fatalities reported in recent weeks. In terms of vaccinations,21,796,278people had been given a first dose and1,090,840people had been given a second dose by the end of Friday. Thousands gathered inside Sydney cricket ground on Saturday for the city's annual Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras celebration. Revellers usually line the city's streets for a huge parade but plans were altered this year because of the pandemic. Some 36,000 attended the stadium event instead - though a small protest march also took place on the usual parade route after an exemption was issued by health officials. Around 5,000 people also took part in a parade, which for 2021 was themed ""Rise"", chosen ""after the challenge and hardship"" of the last year. While gatherings of thousands are unthinkable in much of the world right now, the state of New South Wales has gone 48 days without local coronavirus transmission. Australia has only recorded about 29,000 cases and 900 deaths throughout the whole pandemic. You can see more picture from the celebrationshere. The priority list for the coronavirus vaccine in the UK is set by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation and is primarily in order of age. However, health and social care workers, as well as younger people who are clinically vulnerable are also being prioritised. Between now and the 15 April, the government is aiming to offer everyone over 50, as well as all over-16s with an underlying health condition and unpaid carers for the elderly and disabled, a first jab. There is a target of offering a first dose to everyone over the age of 18 by the end of July. You can read more about the vaccine rollouthere. Some Rangers fans have gathered outside Ibrox Stadium in Glasgow despite coronavirus lockdown rules. Images posted on social media showed flares being set off and fans singing ahead of Rangers' game against St Mirren. No one has been arrested. Under the current restrictions in Scotland public gatherings are banned and a maximum of two people from two households are allowed to meet outdoors. Football games are taking place behind closed doors with no fans in the stadium. Read more. Since 8 December about 18 million people have received at least one dose of a coronavirus vaccine in England. This covers about 38% of the population over the age of 16, according to NHS England figures. Of England's 314 local authorities, NHS data suggestsTendringin Essex vaccinated the highest percentage of its estimated population, as of 28 February, at 51%. Tower Hamletsin London vaccinated the lowest, at 14%. You can read more about how the rollout varies across the country - and the possible reasons behind this -here. Hugh PymBBC News Health Editor The NHS pay row in England, fuelled by angry responses from health unions, rumbles on and seems unlikely to fade away. It is significant that the employers have now entered the fray in the shape of NHS Providers, the group representing hospitals and other trusts in England. NHS trust leaders know only too well that morale is low among an exhausted workforce and they fear that the proposed wage rise will make things worse. They are in effect lining up with the unions to oppose the government. Ministers argue that the pandemic changed everything, including the state of the public finances, and that earlier plans have had to be rethought. They say that compared to other parts of the public workforce facing a pay freeze, the NHS workforce will fare better and that difficult measures were needed to respond to public borrowing increases. But after the unprecedented pressures on hospitals during the pandemic there is growing sympathy for health workers. There will be a difficult few months ahead as the pay review body considers the arguments and ministers decide on their next steps. With schools in England due to reopen to all pupils on Monday, experts will be watching to see the impact on the R number - which measures the virus's ability to spread. R is the number of people that one infected person will pass on the virus to, on average. The latest R estimate for the whole of the UK, from the government's scientific advisory group, Sage, is between 0.7 and 0.9 - meaning that, on average, every 10 people with Covid will infect between seven and nine other people. If the R value is higher than one, then the number of cases keeps increasing. You can read more about the R numberhere. Silvia Kirkham, who works for the gastroenterology unit at
Poole Hospital in Dorset, said she was ""disappointed by not entirely surprised"" by the proposed 1% pay rise for NHS workers, which she described as ""unjust"". She looks after people with chronic illnesses like Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis and said most of her patient appointments had become telephone calls since the pandemic. ""With the pandemic, anxiety levels have gone up among us and
among patients, who are taking immunity suppressants,"" she told the BBC. ""The sheer volume
of work has gone up. I've gone in weekends to make up."" She added: ""[The 1% pay rise]
will change nothing to do with my work ethic. You need to pay your bills, but
we're doing the job for the service of the people. More than 1,000 people came forward on the first day of local surge testing in Stockton in north-east England after a Covid variant from South Africa was discovered there. Anyone over the age of 16 who lives in the TS19 postcode area is being urged to get tested - even if they do not have symptoms. Stockton Council said cases of the more infectious variant needed to be identified ""as quickly as possible"". Council leader Bob Cook said there had been ""a great response"". ""I'd like to thank everyone who has come forward to get a test so far,"" he said. ""The more cases we find, the better chance we have of suppressing this variant."" You can read more about the Stockton variant testinghere. A leading scientist has urged parents dropping off their children at school from Monday to keep following social distancing as the next few weeks ""are going to be crucial"" in keeping infection rates down. Dr
Mike Tildesley, a
member of the government's SPI-M modelling advisory group, told Times Radio it was ""possible"" to keep theR numberbelow one with schools open, but people must continue to follow the rules. ""Just because you're not in the home with your young
children, don't use it as an excuse to go out and mix with other people that you
otherwise wouldn't have done,"" he added. Dr Tildesley said he would have preferred primary
pupils to return to school first ""and maybe a slight delay for secondary
school children going back"". However, he said the impact of vaccinations on infection rates ""hopefully is yet to come"", with current falls most likely due to lockdown measures. An NHS nurse has told the BBC that the government's plans for a below-inflation pay rise of 1% for him and his colleagues has left him feeling ""really betrayed"" after a year in which hospitals have been stretched by the pandemic. Martin Endersby, who works at Pinderfields Hospital in Wakefield, West Yorkshire, said: ""I work in a spinal rehabilitation unit. (On) the ward, we're not
supposed to come into contact with Covid patients, but we do. ""The government encouraged work-from-home schemes so the
general public had a great summer at home last year, with families on full pay. And a furlough scheme that payed people to stay at home - which the public
flouted and didnât follow the rules, whilst NHS staff worked tirelessly to keep
them safe. ""And what did we get? A further pay cut! ""It's been a kick in the teeth. When this all started, we
thought we would get the recognition for what we do. ""And my concern is if weâre forced to strike to get what we deserve, we
will become the villains.""   As we've reported, secondary students will be tested using lateral flow tests when schools in England reopen on Monday. Here's how one school has set up a rapid testing site as it prepares to welcome pupils back to the classroom. This video can not be played You can read more about how testing will work in schoolshere. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent To reduce the risk of spread of the virus, the government has introduced mass testing, with all secondary school pupils offered three tests on their return before being asked to carry them out twice a week at home. These will be rapid lateral flow tests that provide a quick result on the spot, unlike the ones that are carried out in official testing centres - known as PCR tests - that are sent off to labs. The rapid tests are less accurate - they may pick up only between half to three-quarters of positive cases, but given they are being used to spot cases before people develop symptoms or for those who do not develop symptoms, the government is adamant they have an important role. The problem is they can result in a false positive, telling people they are infected when they are not. Research suggests this happens one to three times for every 1,000 tests carried out. One safeguard would be to get anyone who tests positive to then take a PCR test to confirm it. This is being done for tests that are done in people's homes, but not for those carried out in school. Assuming most pupils take up the option of the tests, that could result in thousands of pupils and their close contacts being asked to isolate unnecessarily. That may be a price worth paying if it was spotting many more positives, but the testing done in schools in recent weeks, of pupils and staff who have been attending, shows the number testing positive is now at the lower estimate for the false positivity rate. NHS workers deserve a higher pay rise thanthe 1% proposed by the governmentafter an ""exceptional year"", a senior Conservative MP has said. Sir Roger Gale told the BBC: ""The government indicated clearly that it wanted to reward
the people who have given so much in the health service and a 1% increase which
will be swallowed up effectively by inflation, I donât think is a reward.â However, Gale added that he did not support the position of the unions, with the Royal College of Nursing preparing for strike action and calling for a 12.5% pay rise. He argued this demand was ""unrealistic in the present economic climate"" and strike action ""under these circumstances is unwarranted"". Large numbers of staff could leave nursing when the pandemic is over after being offered a 1% pay rise, the Royal College of Nursing has warned. Patricia Marquis, south-east regional director for the union, told Times Radio it made staff in England feel they were not valued and would worsen the NHS's recruitment issues. She said there were 40,000 nursing vacancies when the pandemic began and there was a ""real risk"" of more experienced staff leaving. But the government has defended its proposal, saying public finances are under unprecedented strain. Read more. Cyprus says it hopes to welcome British tourists who have been vaccinated twice against Covid from May - the month when travel restrictions could be lifted in the UK. But it is unclear how the Mediterranean island will expect people to prove their vaccination status. Foreign travel from the UK is currently banned unless it is for exceptional reasons. The earliest date people in England will be allowed to go abroad for holidays is 17 May, after a review of travel rules takes place. Portugal - like Cyprus a very popular holiday destination for Britons - has also said vaccinated British tourists will be able to visit - as will those who have tested negative or are ""immune"". Again, how people will be expected to prove this remains unclear. Portugal is currently on the UK's red list of high-risk Covid countries - meaning British or Irish citizens and UK residents coming to the UK from there have to quarantine in hotels when they arrive.

"Businessman John McAfee, creator of the McAfee anti-virus software, has been charged in the US with conspiracy to commit fraud and money laundering. Mr McAfee and his bodyguard Jimmy Gale Watson Jr are accused of promoting cryptocurrencies to Mr McAfee's large Twitter following to inflate prices. The currencies were then allegedly sold, making the pair $2m (Â£1.45m), prosecutors said. The men have not commented on the charges. Mr McAfee, 75, is currently beingdetained in Spain in relation to separate criminal charges relating to tax, which he denies. He faces possible extradition to the US. Mr Watson was arrested in Texas on Thursday. ""Jimmy Watson is a decorated veteran and former Navy Seal. He fought for other people's rights and liberties, and he is entitled to and looks forward to his day in court to exercise some of those very rights,"" said his lawyer Arnold Spencer. The strange life of John McAfee The latestcharges were filed in the Manhattan federal court in New York,external. The pair are accused of buying the cryptocurrency assets before promoting them on Twitter, where Mr McAfee has more than one million followers. They would then sell the assets as soon as Mr McAfee's endorsements saw prices rise, according to the US justice department and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. They allegedly made a further $11m (Â£8m) in payments from cryptocurrency start-ups for promoting their assets on Twitter, payments which were not disclosed to investors who  bought them. This video can not be played How crypto-currencies work That amounted to having ""exploited a widely used social media platform and enthusiasm among investors in the emerging cryptocurrency market to make millions through lies and deception,"" federal prosecutor Audrey Strauss said. In the separate tax evasion case - which was announced last October - Mr McAfee is accused of failing to file any tax returns from 2014 to 2018. Prosecutors also say he used other people's names to conceal his assets, including a yacht and property. A controversial figure, he came to prominence in the 1980s when his company released the first commercial anti-virus software - McAfee VirusScan - and helped spark a multi-billion dollar industry. Although that business has since been sold to Intel, he still develops cyber-security products of his own. The entrepreneur, who was born in the UK, also launched unsuccessful bids to become the Libertarian Party's candidate for the US presidential elections in 2016 and 2020. Mr McAfee has previously expressed his disdain for taxes, tweeting in 2019 that he had not filed tax returns for years because ""taxation is illegal"". In 2012, he made headlines afterpolice in the Central American country of Belize investigated the death of one Mr McAfee's neighboursand named him as a ""person of interest"".

"Sarah Everard has been described as ""beautiful, thoughtful and incredibly kind"" The disappearance of a woman who has not been heard from since Wednesday night is causing ""increasing concern"", police have said. Sarah Everard, 33, vanished as she walked home to Brixton, south London, from the Clapham Junction area. Ms Everard spoke to her partner en route but has not been heard from since that point, friend Rose Woollard said. She said her phone signal was picked up last near Clarence Avenue, between her home and where she left another friend. Friends, who last heard from the 33-year-old at about 21:30 GMT on the day she went missing, were unable to contact Ms Everard on Thursday and notified the police. She is 5ft 4in (162cm), has a slim build and blonde hair, and was wearing a green coat, dark trousers and trainers, her best friend Ms Woollard said. Allow Twitter content?

"During the first lockdown, the government encouraged people to pay tribute to healthcare workers by clapping Large numbers of staff could leave nursing when the pandemic is over after being offered a 1% pay rise, the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) has warned. Patricia Marquis from the RCN told Times Radio it made staff in England feel they were not valued and would worsen the NHS's recruitment issues. The body representing NHS trusts has joined unions to criticise the offer. But the government defended its proposal, saying public finances were under unprecedented strain. Ms Marquis, south-east regional director of the RCN, said ""significant numbers"" of nurses were planning to leave and ""this slap in the face from the government really has just reinforced their belief that they are not valued by either the government or perhaps some of the public in the way they would want to be"". She said there were 40,000 nursing vacancies when the pandemic began and there was a ""real risk"" of more experienced staff leaving. How much will NHS staff be paid? Nurse Susan Graham from Kent told the BBC the proposed pay rise was a ""disgrace"" after NHS staff had worked ""crazy hours"" during the Covid crisis. John Anderson, a nurse from East Sussex, said he had taken colleagues to intensive care after they caught coronavirus and called the pay offer a ""kick in the teeth"" for them and their families. ""It feels like the government are happy to have us risk our lives - or even die in this pandemic - but not pay us properly for our jobs,"" he said. The lowest minimum full-time salary - for newly-employed drivers, housekeeping assistants, nursery assistants and domestic support workers - is Â£18,005 per year The starting salary for most newly-qualified nurses is Â£24,907 Staff in ""high-cost areas"", such as London, get extra payments The Department of Health and Social Care has been under pressure to reconsider its pay proposal since last week, when it officially recommended the 1% rise to the independent panel that advises the government on NHS salaries. This video can not be played RCN South East Director Patricia Marquis told Times Radio ""there is a real risk we will lose significant numbers"" NHS Providers, the body that represents employers in the health service, has joined in criticism of the proposal, saying the government's long-term funding plan for the NHS assumed a pay increase in 2021-22 of 2.1% - more than double what is now being offered. Saffron Cordery, deputy chief executive of NHS Providers, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""Given where the NHS is at, given what frontline staff have been through, it seems absolutely wrong to take from their pockets right now the pay rise that was due to them."" Although these assumptions were published in 2019, before the pandemic, NHS Providers said the last year has ""strengthened the case for a larger pay rise for NHS staff"", recommending they receive at least 3%. But the Department of Health maintains that while it set out a legal commitment for funding the NHS, the assumption of a 2.1% pay rise was not enshrined in law, and the financial pressures from the pandemic could not have been foreseen. The NHS pay row in England, fuelled by angry responses from health unions, rumbles on and seems unlikely to fade away. It is significant that the employers have now entered the fray in the shape of NHS Providers, the group representing trusts in England. NHS trust leaders know only too well that morale is low among an exhausted workforce and they fear that the proposed wage rise will make things worse. They are in effect lining up with the unions to oppose the government. Ministers argue that the pandemic changed everything, including the state of the public finances, and that earlier plans have had to be rethought. They say that compared to other parts of the public workforce facing a pay freeze, the NHS workforce will fare better and that difficult measures were needed to respond to public borrowing increases. But after the unprecedented pressures on hospitals during the pandemic there is growing sympathy for health workers. There will be a difficult few months ahead as the pay review body considers the arguments and ministers decide on their next steps. Speaking at Friday's Downing Street briefing, Mr Hancock said the pay award reflected the ""difficult financial circumstances the country is in"". ""We've proposed what we think is affordable to make sure in the NHS people do get a pay rise,"" he said. But Tory MP Dan Poulter, a former health minister who continues to work as a doctor in mental health, said NHS staff had worked without the correct equipment in the early stages of the pandemic and went ""above and beyond"" their hours, so it was ""from a moral perspective, the wrong time to be applying pay restraint."" He said past experience of keeping down NHS wages had also proved it was ""quite counter-productive economically"", forcing the health service to pay more in agency costs instead. The British Medical Association, the Royal College of Midwives, the Royal College of Nursing and Unison wrote a joint letter to Chancellor Rishi Sunak to express their ""dismay"" at the pay rise. ""Our members are the doctors, nurses, midwives, porters, healthcare assistants and more, already exhausted and distressed, who are also expected to go on caring for the millions of patients on waiting lists, coping with a huge backlog of treatment as well as caring for those with Covid-19,"" the letter said. LOCKDOWN RULES:What are they and when will they end? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? COVID IMMUNITY:Can you catch it twice? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? Unite - the third largest union in the NHS - has also said it is considering a strike ballot, while the Royal College of Nursing has said its members should get a 12.5% increase. The pay award would cover nearly all hospital staff, but not GPs and dentists. In addition, some staff whose pay band is being changed will get more than a 1% increase as a result of apreviously agreed three-year pay deal. The government said newly-qualified nurses got a 12% pay rise over the course of that three-year agreement, adding that 1% was a ""real-terms increase"" as the latest official inflation figure was 0.9%. Meanwhile, Labour has said NHS ""heroes"" deserve more money and the proposed increase is ""nothing short of an insult"". This video can not be played The Labour leader says NHS staff and other public sector workers ""need to be properly rewarded"" Alex Norris, Labour's shadow health minister, said he would have recommended a real-terms increase for NHS staff, but said the exact figure should be set by the independent pay review body. He said the public had been out on their doorsteps clapping for the work of NHS staff during the pandemic, and the government should not be ""clapping for them one day and cutting their pay the next"". The NHS in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland is run by the devolved administrations. The Scottish government has announced that 2021-22 pay negotiations will bedelayed until the summer,externalbecause of the disruption caused by Covid. Staff have been given an ""interim"" pay rise of 1%, which will form part of the new settlement. NHS workers in Northern Ireland were promised aone-off Â£500 ""special recognition"" paymentin January, following a similar announcement in Scotland. The Welsh government has said it will not set a ""ceiling"" of 1% on NHS pay rises for 2021-22.

"Schools reopen to all pupils next week in England - the first part of the UK where this will happen. It is a crucial step for children and wider society in the route out of lockdown. Masks are to be worn by secondary school children in classes, while mass testing is being introduced. But will these steps be a help? And does it even matter if infection rates go up? To reduce the risk of spread of the virus, the government has introduced mass testing. All secondary school pupils will be offered three tests on their return before being asked to carry them out twice a week at home. These will be rapid lateral flow tests that provide a quick result on the spot, unlike the ones that are carried out in official testing centres - known as PCR tests - that are sent off to labs. The rapid tests are less accurate - they may pick up only between half to three-quarters of positive cases, but given they are being used to spot cases before people develop symptoms or for those who do not develop symptoms, the government is adamant they have an important role. This video can not be played What does Covid testing in schools look like? The problem is they can result in a false positive, telling people they are infected when they are not. Research suggests this happens one to three times for every 1,000 tests carried out. One safeguard would be to get anyone who tests positive to then take a PCR test to confirm it. This is being done for tests that are done in people's homes, but not for those carried out in school. Assuming most pupils take up the option of the tests, that could result in thousands of pupils and their close contacts being asked to isolate unnecessarily. That may be a price worth paying if it was spotting many more positives, but the testing done in schools in recent weeks, of pupils and staff who have been attending, shows the number testing positive is now at the lower estimate for the false positivity rate. Birmingham University biostatistician Prof Jon Deeks says given the low detection rates that are being seen it is ""absolutely clear"" many of those getting positive test results next week will be false positives. ""Any testing system is a trade-off between benefits and harms,"" he says. ""My concern is that it will actually cause more harm than good."" Concerns have been raised by the Royal Statistical Society, too. Prof Sheila Bird, a member of the society's Covid-19 Task Force, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme false positives were ""very likely"" and that every positive lateral flow test should have a PCR test to confirm it. How fresh air makes school safer 'No evidence' schools spread lots of Covid The devastating toll of the pandemic on children The second key change - and the most controversial - is the recommendation of masks in classes for secondary age schoolchildren. Previously pupils were just expected to wear them in communal areas, like corridors. Critics say it will harm learning and is unfair to expect children to wear masks for hours on end. But others have argued it is an absolute necessity and should have been introduced in primary schools too. The problem is the benefit of mask-wearing is difficult to quantify.Recent evidence from the government advisory group Sage,externalacknowledges this, although it says there is evidence that worn correctly they will have a ""small but significant"" impact on transmission by preventing the wearer from spreading the virus if they are unknowingly infected. This is mainly derived from lab experiments though, and much will depend on how they are used, it says. Will teenagers adhere to the best practice on mask-wearing for hours on end? It is for this reason some experts say they would have liked to see a proper trial in schools to measure the impact. ""We always do this for a medical intervention - there are lots of things that work in the lab but not in the real world,"" says Prof Jonathan Ball, a virologist at Nottingham University. ""But for some reason we don't do this with non-medical interventions. It would be complicated, but this would be the ideal opportunity to do it - and help us decide if they are useful or make matters worse."" Without a trial, the fear is it will be difficult for the government to stop the practice. If cases remain low, it could be argued masks have made the difference and if they creep up, the case could be made they would have gone up more without mask-wearing. The move could, in other words, open a can of worms. But it is a risk ministers seem happy to tackle. The government insists the use of masks is ""temporary and precautionary"" - and  will be reviewed at Easter. Or, in the words of one scientific adviser: ""We know it's not going to make much difference, but if it helps us get schools back, it's worth the hassle when it's dropped."" It is well-established that children are at incredibly low risk from the virus, while research by the Office for National Statistics has shown that teachers areat no higher risk of infection than other working-age people. What role will schools play in the wider spread of the virus though remains more open for debate. Children, after all, come home and mix with their families. Government advisers say schools have not been a key driver of infections so far. This much can be seen from the impact of the second national lockdown in England in November when infection levels fell despite schools being open. But this was before the new UK variant became dominant. Modelling has suggestedreopening schools now could be enough to drive the R number above one,external, which would lead to a growing epidemic. Ministers have already indicated this matters less than it used to because the vaccination programme has begun to break the link between infection rates and serious illness and death - the R number is not one of their tests for slowing the pace of lifting lockdown. Dr Muge Cevik, an infectious disease expert at the University of St Andrews, says it is impossible to disentangle exactly what impact schools have - although she says all the evidence suggests the school outbreaks that have happened have mainly been small. ""The evidence of harms of closing schools is clear. They should be open as default unless there is very strong evidence that closing them will have a significant impact on hospitalisations and mortality.""
