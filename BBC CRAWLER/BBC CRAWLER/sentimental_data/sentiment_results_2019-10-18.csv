"Some have called for firework sales to be banned to protect pets and the vulnerable Sainsbury's has become the first major supermarket to stop selling fireworks at its 2,300 stores across the UK. The company said it made the decision following a regular yearly review of all its products. Last year, a petition to ban the public sale of fireworks to protect animals, children and people with a phobia attracted more than 300,000 signatures. Pet-owners welcomed Sainsbury's decision with many tweeting that other supermarkets should follow suit. A spokeswoman for Sainsbury's declined to detail why the supermarket will no longer sell fireworks, stating that it was commercially sensitive. Tesco and Asda said they would continue to sell fireworks. Catherine Shuttleworth, chief executive and founder of Savvy Marketing, also said that selling fireworks was ""a really expensive way of doing retail in supermarkets"". She said: ""When you go and buy your fireworks, obviously they are not on a shelf anywhere in the store. They tend to be in a glass cabinet that's locked up and a member of staff has to go and unlock that cabinet every single time you want to buy fireworks."" This video can not be played Fireworks: How do they work and how are they made? She also said the customer's age has to be checked because it is illegal to sell fireworks to anyone under 18. In addition, the supermarket cannot send back any unsold products to the distributor, ""and they are quite dangerous to keep in the back of shops, which are busy places"". A petition last year calling for a ban, which gained 307,897 signatures, said that fireworks ""injure thousands of people every year"" and ""cause damage to buildings, vehicles, [and] emergency vehicles"". In response, the government said it ""takes the issue of safety of fireworks very seriously. Legislation is in place to control their sale, use and misuse. We have no plans to change legislation"". One healthcare professional said on Twitter: ""Just came here to say a huge thank you and praise to Sainsbury's for the decision to not sell fireworks this year. It is not just the animals who suffer but anyone who is unwell or has a condition like autism."" Scottish National Party MP Alison Thewliss tweeted: ""Really pleased to see Sainsbury's have taken the responsible decision to stop selling fireworks. I hope other retailers follow suit."" A recent consultation in Scotland over the sale of fireworks to the public found that there was support for tougher controls on the selling and use of the products. Of the 16,000 people who responded, 94% wanted tighter controls on the sale of fireworks and 87% supported an outright ban on the sale of fireworks.

"Harry Dunn died in hospital after his motorbike was involved in a crash with a Volvo Harry Dunn's parents say they expect UK police to charge a US diplomat's wife in connection with his death. Mr Dunn, 19, died after a collision with a car owned by Anne Sacoolas, who was allegedly driving on the wrong side of the road. His parents Charlotte Charles and Tim Dunn travelled to the US as part of their campaign for justice and met President Donald Trump. Mrs Sacoolas, 42, went back to the US after the crash in Northamptonshire. Mr Dunn's family is due back in the UK later, after their trip to the US to seek justice, following the crash outside RAF Croughton - where Mrs Sacoolas' husband is reportedly stationed as an intelligence officer - on 27 August. At the time, Mrs Sacoolas had diplomatic immunity, but both the British and US governments agree that by returning to the US she had forfeited that right. Radd Seiger, the family's spokesman, said they have concerns of  ""misconduct and a cover up on both sides of the Atlantic"". Harry Dunn's parents said a meeting with Anne Sacoolas would not have brought healing to either side. A statement from the family said: ""It is clear that the Americans are desperate to protect Mrs Sacoolas and are intent on ruthlessly and aggressively not letting her return. We are trying to find out why that is. We will not let up in our search for Justice for Harry. ""We now expect Northants Police to take over from the work we have done and the progress we have made, charge her and begin extradition proceedings to bring her back."" Harry Dunn's family threaten judicial review What is diplomatic immunity? US crash suspect's return 'non-negotiable' Is extraditing Anne Sacoolas a realistic prospect? In an interview with ITV, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said:  ""We have done everything we can properly and within the law to clear a path so that justice can be done for the family. And we continue to do so."" Mrs Sacoolas can only be extradited if she is charged by the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) with a criminal offence that is serious enough to warrant it. Northants Police confirmed they were continuing to prepare evidence to hand over to the CPS. Mr Dunn's parentsrejected a ""bombshell"" offer from Donald Trumpto meet Anne Sacoolas at the White House on Tuesday. Charlotte Charles and Tim Dunn had felt ""a little ambushed"" when the president revealed she was in the next room. Anne Sacoolas, pictured on her wedding day in 2003 Mr Trump described his meeting with the couple as ""beautiful"" but ""very sad"". Ms Charles and Mr Dunn are due to meet Northamptonshire's Chief Constable Nick Adderley next week. Mr Seiger said: ""In all my years of practice, I have never seen a family so badly let down after a tragedy and abandoned completely by the system.

"No better outcome than my deal, Johnson says It now needs the approval of the UK and European parliaments However, the DUP has said it will not vote for it The UK Parliament will sit on Saturday and vote on the deal then The PM needs 320 MPs to back him for it to be approved Scottish court has dismissed a bid to stop 'illegal' Brexit deal Mary O'Connor and Sam Tonkin We are going to bring our live coverage to an end here. But we will be back early tomorrow to cover the proceedings in Parliament, which will be sitting on a Saturday for the first time in 37 years and it promises to be an historic occasion. Boris Johnson has spent the day trying to convince MPs to support his Brexit deal, ahead of what is expected to be a knife-edge vote. MPs will gather in the Commons at 09:30 BST for the main debate on the deal - with the voting likely to begin after 14:30 BST. You can read all about what to expect from the sittinghere. In the meantime, ournews storywill continue to be updated with the latest developments.  BBC Radio 5 Live Boris Johnson's deal is MPs' chance to put Brexit ""to bed"", says Conservative MP Tobias Ellwood. Asked what will happen if the deal is not approved, he says: ""There will be a pause for us to then take stock. ""The Benn Act has been put in place to allow that time to consider what does happen next, but the damage this will do for the further debates and discussions with the EU will be unhelpful."" Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage adds that Boris Johnson's deal is ""the second worst"" in history after Theresa May's and ""not worth voting for"". Speaking at his party's rally in Westminster, Mr Farage urged MPs to ""put country before party, vote this deal down and be heroes in the eyes of those who believe in democracy.""  Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage says Boris Johnson's deal is a ""re-heating of Theresa May's deal"" and ""will not get Brexit done"". Speaking at a party rally at Westminster's Queen Elizabeth II centre, Mr Farage says: ""Boris calls it a great new deal. ""It isnât new, because 95% of that withdrawal agreement is exactly
the same as that put by the Commons by Theresa May and voted down three times. ""It is a re-heating of Mrs Mayâs EU treaty and the attempt to
put lipstick on the pig, and I hope and believe the House of Commons and British
public wonât buy it at the fourth time of asking."" The Brexit Party has held a series of rallies in Watford, Camborne in Cornwall, and London's Westminster in the lead up to the 31 October Brexit deadline. Here are the possible outcomes of a vote on theLetwin amendment, which would withhold approval of the dealuntil the legislation to enact it was safely passed. Ian Paisley concludes his speech to the Brexit Party rally: ""We are here for the long term. ""We are here to stay. ""No surrender."" DUP MP Ian Paisley is speaking at a Brexit Party rally. He thanks the party for ""standing with us"" and for ""demonstrating fidelity to the union"". ""And, for not so easily letting go when things become difficult and keeping faith with the Ulster people."" He says the Brexit deal ""will leave part of our union behind"".

Laura KuenssbergBBC political editor It really is extremely tight. It would be foolish to make a guess on which way it will go. What we do know might happen tomorrow is rather than there being a thumbs up or thumbs down vote to the deal, there could be an attempt by some MPs to bring in what they see as an insurance policy. This could mean another delay in case this deal falls through in the next couple of weeks. That is potentially being put forward as an amendment so MPs will have a chance to vote on it. Without going in to all the potential machinations it could mean tomorrow turns, not just into MPs giving an opinion on Boris Johnson's deal, but also wrangling again about a potential delay. This could make things more fuzzy, and certainly more frustrating for Downing Street. It will be a showdown of sorts. It is only a week since Downing Street began seriously to believe that they might get this deal over the line. But they always knew that Parliament would be a very tricky hurdle. BBC News Channel Labour MP for Wakefield Mary Creagh says she will be voting against the deal. ""People have told me they want their vote back, they want to vote on this deal"" she says. ""It's too important to be left to the politicians."" James ShawBBC Scotland reporter A
Scottish judge has rejected a case brought by anti-Brexit campaigners claiming
that the governmentâs deal to leave the EU is unlawful. The
campaigners had argued that the agreement breached the terms of legislation
designed to prevent Northern Ireland from being in a separate customs territory
to the rest of the UK. They had wanted the deal to be suspended. Lord
Pentland refused to grant an order suspending the deal. His reasons have not
yet been published. During
the hearing, he asked if a court order might prevent MPs debating the deal at a
special sitting on Saturday. A lawyer for the government read out a letter from
the speaker, warning that the court should not make an
order stopping debate of any matter before Parliament. A separate
action being brought by the same campaigners seeks to enforce the Benn Act
which is designed to prevent a no-deal Brexit. That is expected to be heard on
Monday if MPs sitting on Saturday reject the prime ministerâs deal.  Boris Johnson also repeated his commitment to leave the EU on 31 October. The prime minister said: ""I think we should leave the European Union on October 31st... Let me say we will leave the European Union on October 31st."" And talking about the deal he struck to resolve the issues over the Irish border, he denied breaking a promise to the Democratic Unionist Party. He said: ""No I donât accept that at all.  I think that what you have is a fantastic deal for all of the UK, and particularly for Northern Ireland because you've got a single customs territory. Northern Ireland leaves the EU with the rest of the UK."" The prime minister told the BBC he wanted the country to move on from Brexit which he described as ""divisive"". He said he was hopeful it would pass in the Commons on Saturday. Mr Johnson said: ""I very much hope so. Look, you know, this has been a long exhausting and quite divisive business Brexit. ""I hope that people will think well, you know, what's the balance, what do our constituents really want? Do they want us to keep going with this argument, do they want more division and delay?"" Boris Johnson has suggested there is ""no better outcome"" than the Brexit deal he is putting forward. In an interview with the BBC, the prime minister said:

""There's no better outcome than the one I'm advocating tomorrow."" Urging MPs to come together and support the deal he secured in Brussels on Thursday, Mr Johnson said there was now a ""chance to move on"". He said: ""I just kind of invite everybody to imagine what it could be like tomorrow evening, if we have settled this, and we have respected the will of the people, because we will then have a chance to move on."" Read morehere. Former prime ministers Tony Blair and John Major have made a film to be shown at Saturday's People's Vote rally in London. In the film, they warn that Brexit risks undermining the Good Friday Agreement and peace in Northern Ireland, saying: âEither Northern Ireland and
its hard-won peace is sacrificed on the Brexit altar or we end up in the
bizarre situation where Northern Ireland stays in Europeâs trading system."" They call for a second referendum, saying of Saturday's Parliament vote: ""Whatever is the outcome, no deal or bad deal, it should not pass without the final say resting with the
people. âThese Brexiteers talk about
the will of the people.  But in 2016 our knowledge was necessarily
limited. Now, three years on, three years of mess, misery and mayhem, when our
knowledge is vastly expanded by experience, how can it be undemocratic to ask
the British people their final opinion?"" The party's Brexit spokesperson says it wants Conservatives to ""take a stand"" in Saturday's vote. Scotland's highest civil court has dismissed a legal bid to stop the UK government from passing its proposed EU withdrawal agreement. Campaigners had argued that the agreement breached the terms of legislation designed to prevent Northern Ireland from being in a separate customs territory to the rest of the UK. They had wanted the deal to be suspended. Judge Lord Pentland refused to grant an order suspending the deal - his reasons have not yet been published. Read the news storyhere. Former Chancellor Philip Hammond is asking the prime minister to pledge not to ""dupe"" MPs into a no-deal Brexit down the line if they back his deal tomorrow. Writing in the Times, Mr Hammond says he will back the Letwin amendment so that Boris Johnson has to ask for a Brexit extension even if his deal passes, to prevent Brexiteers voting against the deal at a later stage oncethe Benn Acthas expired.

"Peter Farquhar and Benjamin Field held a betrothal ceremony in 2014 A churchwarden who murdered an author to inherit his estate has been jailed for a minimum of 36 years. Benjamin Field, 28, duped 69-year-old Peter Farquhar into a fake relationship to get him to change his will. Mr Farquhar died in the Buckinghamshire village of Maids Moreton in October 2015 and Field tried to make his death look like an accident or suicide. The Baptist minister's son was found guilty of murder at Oxford Crown Court in August. He was also accused of plotting to kill Mr Farquhar's neighbour Ann Moore-Martin, 83, but was found not guilty. Mr Justice Sweeney said Field was a ""well-practiced and able liar"", adding: ""I have no doubt that you are a dangerous offender."" How Ben Field thought he'd get away with murder The manipulative murderer who fooled a church Field admitted duping both Mr Farquhar and Miss Moore-Martin into fake relationships with him as part of a plot to get them to change their wills, but denied any involvement in their deaths. Miss Moore-Martin died of natural causes in May 2017. University lecturer Mr Farquhar and Field had undergone a ""betrothal"" ceremony while the trial heard Field and former headmistress Miss Moore-Martin had a sexual relationship. Oxford Crown Court heard Miss Moore-Martin could not believe she had fallen for Field's lies The court heard Field carried out a sustained ""gaslighting"" plot aimed at making Mr Farquhar question his sanity. Mr Farquhar's drinks were topped up with bioethanol and poteen, a high strength Irish alcohol, and his food was laced with drugs. Jurors were told Field ""suffocated him"" when he was too weak to resist, and left a half-empty bottle of whisky in Mr Farquhar's room to create the misconception he had drunk himself to death. 'Evil' churchwarden guilty of murdering author Listen: BBC Sounds - Killer in the congregation Mr Farquhar, who taught part-time at the University of Buckingham, had three novels published. His third book, A Wide Wide Sea, was dedicated to Field, who delivered the eulogy at his funeral. Benjamin Field has been jailed for life with a minimum term of 36 years In an attempt to get Miss Moore-Martin to change her will, Field would write ""messages from God"" on mirrors around her home. The deeply religious retired teacher who never married or had children, later changed her will to leave her home to Field. A consultant psychiatrist said Field ""knew exactly what he was doing, in a carefully planned and orchestrated way and was in full control of his own decision making"". In a statement after the sentencing Mr Farquhar's brother, Ian Farquhar, said: ""Ben Field is a deeply malevolent and thoroughly evil man who callously and greedily seduced his way into my brother's life. ""His sentence today brings some justice to this horrific event in our family's life. Though of course the wound will always remain Mark Glover, of Thames Valley Police, said Field was ""unlike any other criminal"" he had encountered in his 31-year career. ""The extent of his planning, deception and cruelty towards his victims is frankly staggering, and I do not believe he has ever shown an ounce of remorse or contrition,"" he said. ""If he is sorry for anything it is that he got caught."" Benjamin Field took photos of the messages he wrote on mirrors in Miss Moore-Martin's home Field, of Wellingborough Road, Olney, Buckinghamshire, previously pleaded guilty to four counts of fraud relating to the fake relationships and defrauding Miss Moore-Martin out of Â£4,000 for a car and Â£27,000 for a dialysis machine. He also admitted two counts of burglary. He was sentenced to life in prison and ordered to serve a minimum of 36 years.

"Labour has warned that Boris Johnson's revised Brexit deal would threaten workers' rights and protections in the future. The concerns have been echoed by several union leaders. But Boris Johnson has insisted the UK will ""maintain the highest possible standards in social protections and the environment"". So, why the sudden focus on workers' rights? It's all to do with something called the ""level playing field"" - the idea that countries keep their rules and standards close, to stop one country giving their businesses a competitive advantage - for example by having lower standards and so lower costs. The extent to which the UK might diverge from EU regulations in the future and become an economic competitor has been a big issue in the Brexit debate. EU regulations cover things like: The working time directive, which limits the number of hours people can work Maximum amounts of particular pollutants there can be in the air Requirements for workers doing the same jobs to be paid equally. They set minimum standards below which government cannot go. After Brexit, UK governments would no longer have to abide by these minimum levels. In thenew Brexit deal,externalfinalised this week, references to a level playing field were removed from the legally-binding withdrawal agreement. Instead, they appear in the non-binding political declaration on the future relationship - as an aspiration, but not a legal commitment. Labour's shadow Brexit secretary, Sir Keir Starmer accused the government of pursuing ""a licence to deregulate"" the economy in the future. He warned that - after Brexit - the UK might choose to follow other ""economic models"" (than the EU's) and cited the example of the United States where, he said, the holiday entitlement was 10 days a year and companies ""had far more power than the workforce"". In response to concerns, the government said that after Brexit it would report back to parliament whenever the EU changes its rules on workers' rights, on whether the UK plans to take action to mirror them. MPs would be given a chance to vote on this. Boris Johnson has made it known that he wants a slightly more distant economic relationship with the EU in the future than Theresa May did. She talked about the ""broadest and deepest possible"" economic partnership. He wants a more basic free trade agreement, with zero tariffs (taxes on imports) or quotas, which gives the UK more opportunity to go its own way. Too many level playing field commitments could get in the way of that. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. What is in Boris Johnson's new Brexit deal? Where have the UK and EU compromised? The revised political declaration says that the UK and the EU should ""uphold the common high standards... in the areas of state aid, competition, social and employment standards, environment, climate change, and relevant tax matters"". But if words of that kind do not appear in a binding treaty, then this or any future government could opt to change its mind. The EU is well aware of that - and some countries are more concerned about the nature of the future relationship in this area than in the precise details of the divorce agreement. ""With the departure of Great Britain, a potential competitor will of course emerge for us,"" Angela Merkel said on a visit to Paris in the run-up to this summit. ""That is to say, in addition to China and the United States of America, there will be Great Britain as well."" The UK is a far smaller economy than the US or China. But it is right on the EU's doorstep, intimately connected to European markets, and thus is seen as a potential threat. What claims do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

"A total of 58 people fell ill after attending Vicki and Phil Kemp's wedding in October 2017 A catering firm that ""spoiled"" a couple's wedding day with a salmonella-ridden hog roast has been ordered to pay nearly Â£250,000. In total, 58 guests fell ill after tucking into the meaty centrepiece at Vicki and Phil Kemp's reception. The pair were so ill they had to cancel their Dominican Republic honeymoon, Cannock Magistrates' Court heard. Galloping Gourmet Ltd admitted two food safety offences, was fined Â£200,000 and ordered to pay Â£49,936 in costs. In a statement, the firm apologised ""for the distress and discomfort"" caused and said it has since made changes in its procedures to ""ensure that this never happens again"". Symptoms experienced by guests, three of whom needed hospital treatment, included nausea, stomach cramps, vomiting, diarrhoea, and fatigue, it said. Lichfield District Council, which identified the salmonella outbreak, described the contaminated meat as ""dangerously undercooked"". It added the firm had not taken customers' health and safety seriously enough. Latest news from the West Midlands IT technician Mr Kemp, 35, of Burntwood, Lichfield, said in a statement: ""My illness lasted around 10 days all in all, but the symptoms were so bad that we had no option but to cancel our honeymoon. I was totally devastated. ""No-one should have to go through what we have, especially in relation to their wedding day - it is just not acceptable. ""Sadly a lot of the memories about what should have been the happiest day of mine and Vikki's lives are spoilt by what happened."" The company admitted placing unsafe food on the market and failing to ensure safety procedures were adequately implemented. Jatinder Paul, of law firm Irwin Mitchell, said the case was ""particularly devastating for those involved... on what was meant to be a memorable and very special day"". Venue Packington Moor, which hosted the October 2017 event, was not at fault, the council said.

Mr Farquhar died in the Buckinghamshire village of Maids Moreton in October 2015 and Field tried to make his death look like an accident or suicide. The Baptist minister's son was found guilty of murder at Oxford Crown Court in August. He was also accused of plotting to kill Mr Farquhar's neighbour Ann Moore-Martin, 83, but was found not guilty. Mr Justice Sweeney said Field was a ""well-practiced and able liar"", adding: ""I have no doubt that you are a dangerous offender."" How Ben Field thought he'd get away with murder The manipulative murderer who fooled a church Field admitted duping both Mr Farquhar and Miss Moore-Martin into fake relationships with him as part of a plot to get them to change their wills, but denied any involvement in their deaths. Miss Moore-Martin died of natural causes in May 2017. University lecturer Mr Farquhar and Field had undergone a ""betrothal"" ceremony while the trial heard Field and former headmistress Miss Moore-Martin had a sexual relationship. Oxford Crown Court heard Miss Moore-Martin could not believe she had fallen for Field's lies The court heard Field carried out a sustained ""gaslighting"" plot aimed at making Mr Farquhar question his sanity. Mr Farquhar's drinks were topped up with bioethanol and poteen, a high strength Irish alcohol, and his food was laced with drugs. Jurors were told Field ""suffocated him"" when he was too weak to resist, and left a half-empty bottle of whisky in Mr Farquhar's room to create the misconception he had drunk himself to death. 'Evil' churchwarden guilty of murdering author Listen: BBC Sounds - Killer in the congregation Mr Farquhar, who taught part-time at the University of Buckingham, had three novels published. His third book, A Wide Wide Sea, was dedicated to Field, who delivered the eulogy at his funeral. Benjamin Field has been jailed for life with a minimum term of 36 years In an attempt to get Miss Moore-Martin to change her will, Field would write ""messages from God"" on mirrors around her home. The deeply religious retired teacher who never married or had children, later changed her will to leave her home to Field. A consultant psychiatrist said Field ""knew exactly what he was doing, in a carefully planned and orchestrated way and was in full control of his own decision making"". In a statement after the sentencing Mr Farquhar's brother, Ian Farquhar, said: ""Ben Field is a deeply malevolent and thoroughly evil man who callously and greedily seduced his way into my brother's life. ""His sentence today brings some justice to this horrific event in our family's life. Though of course the wound will always remain Mark Glover, of Thames Valley Police, said Field was ""unlike any other criminal"" he had encountered in his 31-year career. ""The extent of his planning, deception and cruelty towards his victims is frankly staggering, and I do not believe he has ever shown an ounce of remorse or contrition,"" he said. ""If he is sorry for anything it is that he got caught."" Benjamin Field took photos of the messages he wrote on mirrors in Miss Moore-Martin's home Field, of Wellingborough Road, Olney, Buckinghamshire, previously pleaded guilty to four counts of fraud relating to the fake relationships and defrauding Miss Moore-Martin out of Â£4,000 for a car and Â£27,000 for a dialysis machine. He also admitted two counts of burglary. He was sentenced to life in prison and ordered to serve a minimum of 36 years.

"Women's fashion chain BonmarchÃ©  has appointed administrators, putting the future of the business in doubt. The chain's 318 shops will remain open while a buyer is sought for the chain. BonmarchÃ© chief executive Helen Connolly said she had made the decision with ""deep regret and sadness"", and blamed tough High Street trading conditions, and the Brexit delay. The Yorkshire-based chain, which specialises in clothing for the over-50s, employs 2,887 people. ""We have spent a number of months examining our business model and looking for alternatives. But we have been sadly forced to conclude that under the present terms of business, our model simply does not work,"" she added. She added the ""the drawn-out Brexit process"" had damaged sales. ""Without such a delay, it is feasible to believe that our issues would have been more manageable. Instead, it has only intensified the pressures,"" she said. Ms Connolly said the firm had considered a refinancing or a rescue deal, known as a company voluntary agreement (CVA) with its landlords and lenders. This is an insolvency process that allows a business to reach an agreement with its creditors to pay off all or part of its debts and is often used as an opportunity to renegotiate rents. However, she said the firm had concluded that neither option would ""fundamentally change the core challenges facing the business"". ""We are sadly no longer in a position to demonstrate to our shareholders that the business can continue as a going concern,"" she added. The struggling retailer warned earlier this yearthat trading had deteriorated. Philip Day started his career at clothing manufacturers Coats Viyella and Wensum UK billionaire and Edinburgh Woollen Mill Group owner Philip Day is the majority owner of the chain, with a 95% stake via his Dubai-based investment vehicle Spectre. Spectre said: ""We are disappointed with the result of our investment in Bonmarche, but our primary thought at this time is with the business' employees and families."" Administrator FRP Advisory said it had been appointed because the business was no longer able to meet its financial obligations. It emphasised that trading would continue and no redundancies had been made. ""There is every sign that we can continue trading while we market BonmarchÃ© for sale and believe that there will be interest to take on the business,"" it said. BonmarchÃ© is the latest retailer to be hit by tough conditions amid growing competition from online retailers and higher operating costs, such as a rising minimum wage and business rates. It has led to big names such as Toys R Us going into administration, while others such as Topshop-owner Arcadia, Debenhams and New Look have announced large-scale closures. Do you run a business?

"Emergency services were called to the Tate Modern on 4 August A six-year-old boy who was allegedly thrown off a 10th floor balcony at the Tate Modern is out of intensive care, his family has said. The boy, who was visiting London with his family, suffered a ""deep"" bleed to the brain in the fall on 4 August. The French national, who cannot be named, is in a rehabilitation centre with splints on some of his limbs. Jonty Bravery, from west London, has been charged with attempted murder. The 18-year-old, who was 17 when he was charged in August, is due to appear in court for a plea hearing next month. Jonty Bravery, 18, has been charged with attempted murder In a post on a crowdfunding page, which has raised more than Â£107,000 for the injured boy's care, his family said he was making progress but had not yet been able to speak. ""He is now in a rehabilitation centre,"" the post said, adding: ""He still has some metal in his body but instead of plasters he has got a full armour of splints - legs, feet, hands, arms, neck and torso."" The family described him as a ""little knight"" and added his splints could sometimes be taken off. ""He also makes some little progresses - he moves his right hand more and more, and arm on command,"" the post continued. ""We really hope he will speak and eat again as soon as possible, but we know that it can take months.

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""They will want to vote for it on Saturday"" Boris Johnson is in a race against time to sell the Brexit deal he has struck with the EU to MPs ahead of a Commons vote on Saturday. The prime ministerinsists he is ""very confident""of getting the majority he needs to ""get Brexit done"" by his 31 October deadline. But the DUP and every opposition party plans to vote against his deal. That means he must persuade Labour rebels, ex-Tories and Brexiteers in his own party to get on board. A spokesman for Mr Johnson said he and and his team were spending the day on the phone to MPs from across the Commons to sell the deal. The PM is also holding a cabinet meeting in No 10. Saturday sitting of Parliament: What to expect The DUP's Brexit spokesman, Sammy Wilson, said his party would not only vote Mr Johnson down,but urge Conservative MPs to ""take a stand"" with them, setting the scene for a frantic day of arm-twisting on all sides at Westminster.

Labour has also attacked the deal after one Tory MP, John Baron, said the UK would be able to leave the EU ""on no-deal terms"" if trade talks failed come December 2020 - the so-called transition period. The party's chairman, Ian Lavery, said: ""The cat has been let out of the bag... [and] no one should be in any doubt that Johnson's deal is just seen an interim arrangement."" But Home Secretary Priti Patel urged colleagues to look at the deal as an opportunity to ""start a new chapter for our country"". The prime minister will make a statement to the Commons on Saturday, before another minister opens a debate on the deal. If he does not manage to get the numbers needed to win a vote, then he is expected to try again to trigger a general election. Latest as PM tries to get MPs behind deal Johnson still facing an almighty gamble What is in Boris Johnson's new Brexit deal? New Brexit deal: Your questions answered The law states that the PM must ask the EU for a three month extension to the Brexit deadline if he cannot get a deal through Parliament. The text of the letter he must send to Brussels is contained in the so-called Benn Act, passed last month by MPs determined to prevent a no-deal Brexit. Mr Johnson has said the UK will leave on 31 October with or without a deal - but he has also said he will abide by the law. But even if MPs vote for his deal on Saturday, he may still have to ask the EU for an extension. Former Conservative MP Oliver Letwin hastabled an amendmentthat would ensure the deadline is extended until the Brexit deal had passed each step in Parliament to become law. Sir Oliver, who is among the MPs seeking to prevent a no-deal Brexit, said he did not want to ""let the government off the hook"". By BBC Parliamentary Correspondent Mark D'Arcy Sir Oliver's amendment is a cunningly-crafted proposition which, crucially, could be voted for by MPs who want a deal, but don't trust this one, and don't trust the government. It rests on the idea that were Parliament to approve the deal for the purposes of the Benn Act now, there might then be a danger that the subsequent legislation to enact it might be, somehow, derailed, resulting in a no-deal exit on 31 October. With the Benn Act out of the way, they believe that some manoeuvre, some legislative judo move, by factions inside and outside the government, who favour a ""clean Brexit"" could leave no time for any effective counterâ¦ and Britain would be out, with no deal. This reflects the sheer level of distrust that has accumulated over several cycles of Brexit angst. Read Mark's full blog The SNP's Westminster leader Ian Blackford has also tabled an amendment, calling fora three month extension to Brexit to allow for an early general election. He told the BBC the deal gives Northern Ireland a ""competitive advantage"", but ""shafted"" Scotland. This video can not be played Will MPs support Boris Johnson's new Brexit deal? Meanwhile, cabinet ministers have been touring the TV and radio studios to sell the deal. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab told BBC Radio 4's Today programme it was ""an opportunity to get Brexit done, turn the page and move forward"". The new deal is largely the same as the one agreed by Theresa May last year - but it removes the controversial backstop clause, which critics say could have kept the UK tied indefinitely to EU customs rules. Northern Ireland would remain in the UK's customs union under the new agreement, but there would also be customs checks on some goods passing through en route to Ireland and the EU single market. The prime minister is expected to focus his attention on winning over three groups to support his deal: Tory Brexiteers who have not yet backed a deal and repeatedly voted against former PM Theresa May's withdrawal agreement Twenty-three former Tory MPs who now sit as independents, including21 Mr Johnson kicked out of the partylast month after they rebelled against him in a bid to prevent a no-deal Brexit And a group of Labour MPs who have expressed a desire to back a deal but are concerned about protection for workers and the environment This video can not be played DUP: PM 'too eager for deal at any cost' The DUP is unhappy with the changes, claiming they are not in the best interests of Northern Ireland. But the Northern Irish party can no longer rely on the automatic support of the the pro-Brexit European Research Group - formed of backbench Tory MPs. Vice-chairman of the group, Mark Francois, told reporters he ""still has some concerns about some of the specifics of the deal"", and was meeting the prime minister ""to put some questions directly to [him]."" But ERG member Andrew Bridgen told BBC Breakfast he believed the ""vast majority"" of the group ""will come to the conclusion that this deal is tolerable and we need to get Brexit across the line"". The ERG will hold a meeting on Saturday morning to advise a position to members to take in Parliament. What is in the new Brexit deal? DUP 'unable to vote' for PM's new Brexit deal Labour's shadow chancellor John McDonnell told the Today programme the deal was ""worse deal than Theresa May's"", adding: ""We can't vote for that or let it go through"". But while Labour's focus was on defeating the government's proposals, Mr McDonnell said discussions were ongoing about a further referendum - either on Mr Johnson's deal or a ""sensible deal"" negotiated by Labour. ""There are discussions taking place [about] when the right time to put an amendment down is,"" he said. ""There is a principle here to be established to let the people decide."" He also warned there would be ""consequences"" for MPs in his party who voted for Mr Johnson's deal. However, on Wednesday, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn played down the possibility of removing the party whip from any rebels. ""I believe in the power of persuasion rather than the power of threat,"" he said. Labour MP Ronnie Campbell, who is standing down at the next election, said ""at the moment"" he would vote to support the deal. But he told the BBC: ""I am getting a lot of pressure from the head lads of the Labour Party... to abstain."" This video can not be played Crunching the numbers as MPs prepare for key Brexit vote The winning post for votes in the House of Commons is 320 if everyone turns up - seven Sinn Fein MPs do not sit and the Speaker and three deputies do not vote. There are currently 287 voting Conservative MPs. The prime minister needs to limit any rebellion among them. Then, if the DUP will not support his deal, he will need the backing of 23 former Conservative MPs who are currently independents. Most will probably support the deal, but not all. That is still not quite enough, though, so the PM will also need the backing of some Labour MPs and ex-Labour independents. In March, when MPs voted on Theresa May's deal for the third time, five Labour MPs backed it, plus two ex-Labour independents. This time it is likely to be a bit higher than that because several MPs have said they would now back a deal. All this still leaves the vote very close. And it is possible some MPs could abstain, making it even harder to predict the outcome.

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""Chance to move on"" with Brexit Boris Johnson has urged MPs to ""come together"" to back the Brexit deal he has secured with the EU, insisting there is ""no better outcome"". The prime minister told the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg he wanted the country to ""move on"" from Brexit, which he described as ""divisive"". And he said he was hopeful the deal would pass the Commons on Saturday. The government's former allies in the DUP and every opposition party plans to vote against it. As it happened: Reaction as PM tries to get MPs to back deal Saturday's Brexit debate: What to expect What is in Boris Johnson's new Brexit deal? Could the Letwin amendment delay Brexit? The new deal, agreed by Mr Johnson and the EU on Thursday, is similar to the one agreed by Theresa May last year - but it removes the controversial backstop clause, which critics say could have kept the UK tied indefinitely to EU customs rules. Northern Ireland would remain in the UK's customs union under the new agreement, but there would also be customs checks on some goods passing through en route to Ireland and the EU single market. Mr Johnson and his team are trying to persuade enough Labour rebels, former Conservatives and Brexiteer Tory rebels to get it across the line in Parliament. He told the BBC's political editor: ""I just kind of invite everybody to imagine what it could be like tomorrow (Saturday) evening, if we have settled this, and we have respected the will of the people, because we will then have a chance to to move on. ""I hope that people will think well, you know, what's the balance, what do our constituents really want? ""Do they want us to keep going with this argument, do they want more division and delay? Look, you know, this has been a long exhausting and quite divisive business Brexit."" He repeated his commitment to leave the EU on 31 October, adding: ""There's no better outcome than the one I'm advocating tomorrow."" Mr Johnson has repeatedly said Brexit will happen by the end of the month with or without a deal. But MPs passed a law in September, known as the Benn Act, which requires the PM to send a letter to the EU asking for an extension until January 2020 if a deal is not agreed - or if MPs do not back a no-deal Brexit. Former Tory Sir Oliver Letwin - who was kicked out of the party for backing the law - has put an amendment down to ensure the extension is asked for even if MPs back the deal in the Commons on Saturday. He said the government could still leave without a deal on 31 October if the PM's proposals had not passed every stage in Parliament to become law - so the motion would withhold MPs' approval until that final hurdle is passed. Meanwhile, responding to the deal,Bank of England Governor Mark Carneysaid taking no deal off the table was a ""net economic positive"". It really is extremely tight. It would be foolish to make a guess on which way it will go. What we do know might happen tomorrow is rather than there being a thumbs up or thumbs down vote to the deal, there could be an attempt by some MPs to bring in what they see as an insurance policy. This could mean another delay in case this deal falls through in the next couple of weeks. That is potentially being put forward as an amendment so MPs will have a chance to vote on it. Without going in to all the potential machinations it could mean tomorrow turns, not just into MPs giving an opinion on Boris Johnson's deal, but also wrangling again about a potential delay. This could make things more fuzzy, and certainly more frustrating for Downing Street. It will be a showdown of sorts. Downing Street always knew that Parliament would be a very tricky hurdle. This video can not be played In full: Laura Kuenssberg grills Johnson on Brexit deal Mr Johnson was also quizzed about the deal he has struck with the EU to resolve the issues over the Irish border. He denied breaking a promise to the DUP, saying: ""No I don't accept that at all. ""I think that what you have is a fantastic deal for all of the UK, and particularly for Northern Ireland because you've got a single customs territory. Northern Ireland leaves the EU with the rest of the UK."" The DUP has accused Mr Johnson of ""selling Northern Ireland short"" by accepting checks on some goods passing through Northern Ireland to get a deal with the EU. The party's Brexit spokesman, Sammy Wilson, has described the deal as ""toxic"" and is urging Conservative MPs not to back it. The pro-Brexit European Research Group has previously given its full backing to the DUP. On Friday evening vice-chairman Mark Francois told the BBC he would be voting for the deal, while another member, Andrew Bridgen, said the ""vast majority"" of the group ""will come to the conclusion that this deal is tolerable"". This video can not be played Will MPs support Boris Johnson's new Brexit deal? Labour plans to vote against the government motion, and in a letter to his own MPs Jeremy Corbyn said it was a ""worse deal"" than the one Theresa May struck with Brussels. He said the proposals ""risk triggering a race to the bottom on rights and protections"". ""This sell-out deal won't bring the country together and should be rejected,"" Mr Corbyn added. The party also attacked the deal after one Conservative MP, John Baron, told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme the UK would be able to leave the EU ""on no-deal terms"" if trade talks failed at the end of the so-called transition period in December 2020. Labour chairman Ian Lavery said: ""The cat has been let out of the bag... [and] no one should be in any doubt that Johnson's deal is just seen an interim arrangement."" However, the government appears to have moved to try and win the support of some Labour MPs by promising to boost workers' rights and environmental standards after Brexit. Downing Street said the pledge followed discussions with Labour MPs and would also include a commitment to giving Parliament a say in the future relationship with the EU. The SNP's Westminster leader Ian Blackford has also tabled an amendment, calling fora three-month extension to Brexit to allow for an early general election. And Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage called the deal ""the second worst deal in history"" behind Theresa May's withdrawal agreement. Commons business will start at 9:30 BST on Saturday - the first weekend sitting since the invasion of the Falklands in 1982. Mr Johnson will make a statement to the House and face questions from MPs, before they move on to a debate about the deal. The timing of any votes depends on which amendments are chose by the Speaker of the Commons, John Bercow. Crunching the numbers on key Brexit deal vote.

"A Brexit deal has been agreed by the UK and EU, but what does it all mean? We answer a sample of the questions we have received from readers. Under law, yes he does. The Benn Act, passed by MPs last month,says that Mr Johnson would be required to request a three-month Brexit delay - unless he can pass a deal, or get MPs to approve a no-deal exit by 19 October. That's Saturday. Parliamentwill be sitting that day, which is when MPs are likely to hold a vote on Mr Johnson's new deal. The UK will still pay a ""divorce bill"" under Mr Johnson's deal. However, because the UK has had an extended stay in the EU,the actual bill would now be about Â£33bn,external. The new proposals are much the same as Theresa May's deal. The main difference is on the crucial issue of the Irish border and whether the UK will leave the customs union entirely after the transition period. Please upgrade your browser Use the list below or select a button The UK does not plan to introduce visas for tourists from the EU. So, for short-term trips, things should be more or less the same. Since the UK voted to leave the EU, the value of the pound has fallen. This is despitea small rise after the deal was announced. This is because of all the uncertainty around what Brexit might look like. It's hard to predict how the value of the pound will change. One common suggestion to get the most out of your holiday money is to change half a few weeks before, and the other half a couple of days before, to hedge your bets. The Labour leader said the deal is worse than Mrs May's because the proposals ""risk triggering a race to the bottom on rights and protections"". He said the deal would be ""putting food safety at risk, cutting environmental standards and workers' rights, and opening up our NHS to a takeover by US private corporations"". Mr Corbyn said the deal should be rejected. No, not as the law currently stands. The European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 says that in order to make a withdrawal agreement valid, it has to be approved by Parliament. You are hearing about Northern Ireland because the removal of the old backstop is probably the biggest single change. Other parts of the withdrawal agreement, such as the transition period, citizens' rights, and the money the UK has to pay, will stay the same. The UK will still follow EU rules and regulations until the end of 2020. But under the new deal the whole of the UK will definitely leave the EU customs union at that point. The UK will also leave the single market, but Northern Ireland will continue to follow all its regulations for agrifood and industrial goods. There have also been changes to the political declaration which sets out plans for the long-term relationship between the UK and the EU. It says the future relationship will be based on a Free Trade Agreement, but there's no guarantee one can be agreed by the end of 2020. Mr Johnson's deal mainly focuses on solving the problem of the Irish border. When it comes to citizens' rights, he has kept the agreements made by Mrs May. UK nationals living legally in an EU country at the end of the transition period on 31 December 2020 will be able to stay and enjoy the same rights. Anyone arriving after that will be subject to each country's immigration rules. Up until the end of transition, UK nationals will still be able to move freely to the EU. No, there would not be a hard border as long as the provisions of the deal stay in place. Under the deal there would be no customs checks or regulatory checks on goods going between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. The solution - in this deal - is to effectively have the customs and regulatory border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK (you will hear people talk about ""a border in the Irish Sea""). The EU has said - in practice - this will mean all checks on goods will be done by UK officials ""at points of entry"" in Northern Ireland. The Northern Ireland Assembly would get a chance to vote on these arrangements four years after the end of the transition period (which finishes at the end of 2020 but could be extended by a year or two years). And even if they were voted down - which is considered unlikely - there would then be a two-year cooling off period for other arrangements to be made to try to avoid a hard border. Yes, the UK would leave the EU's customs union, through which matters of trade are negotiated for all of its members as a bloc. That means the whole of the UK will be able to strike its own trade deals with non-EU countries as well as with the EU - although this could take some time. What is in the new Brexit deal? What are the backstop options? Can a no-deal Brexit still happen? The deal states that at the end of the transition period is in December 2020, while the rest of the UK will leave all of the EU's institutions, Northern Ireland will have to keep to some of the EU's rules. In some cases it will have to charge EU taxes on certain types of goods. This situation will continue until a new agreement on the future relationship is reached, or Northern Ireland votes down the deal. Its government will have the opportunity to vote on the provisions of this deal after four years, and then at least every eight years after that.

"Jo Maugham QC led the action at the Court of Session in Edinburgh Scotland's highest civil court has dismissed a legal bid to stop the UK government from passing its proposed EU withdrawal agreement. Anti-Brexit campaigners had argued the deal contravened legislation preventing Northern Ireland from forming part of a separate customs territory. However, Lord Pentland ruled the application was ""misconceived and unjustified"". Campaigner Jo Maugham QC said the case was now unlikely to proceed further. In hiswritten opinion,external, the judge described the petition ""of very doubtful competency"" and concluded the petitioner had at best a ""weak"" case. Lord Pentland issued his decision on Friday afternoon Mr Maugham had lodged the petition on Thursday in an attempt to stop Parliament from passing the EU withdrawal agreement. After the ruling was published hetweeted,external: ""That was a difficult decision to make. It is difficult to move quickly and accurately and, the court has found, I got that decision wrong. ""We will review the decision carefully but my instinct is that we are unlikely to proceed to a full hearing for reasons indicated above."" He launched the legal challenge after the prime minister and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker announced on Thursday that the two sides had come to an agreement on a Brexit withdrawal deal, ahead of a crucial EU summit in Brussels. EU leaders then approved the deal, and MPs are expected to vote on it on Saturday. Aidan O'Neill QC is representing Mr Maugham in the case Earlier Aidan O'Neill QC, acting for the petitioner, told the court that the proposed Brexit deal would mean a ""continuing regime of EU law applicable to Northern Ireland"" - contrary to Section 55 of the Taxation (Cross-Border Trade) Act 2018. He said this would breach the Act's terms by creating different customs rules in Northern Ireland to the rest of the UK, leaving the deal void and unsuitable to be put before Parliament. Mr O'Neill said: ""The agreement which was presented yesterday is void; is of no effect as a matter of law."" Prime Minister Boris Johnson and European Commission President Jean Claude Juncker leave their joint press conference on Thursday Government lawyers defended the deal and claimed the legal action was a ""direct and manifest interference with Parliament"". Gerry Moynihan QC, acting for the government, described the legal challenge as ""a gross intrusion into the separation of power."" He argued Northern Ireland would remain in the UK's customs territory because ""a substantial part"" of trade would still be with the UK.

"This video can not be played Watch clashes between Mexico's security forces and drug cartel members Mexico's president has defended freeing drug kingpin JoaquÃ­n ""El Chapo"" GuzmÃ¡n's son soon after his arrest. When Ovidio GuzmÃ¡n LÃ³pez was seized at a house on a judge's warrant in the city of CuliacÃ¡n, cartel gunmen fought street battles with security forces. At least eight people were killed and 16 wounded, the authorities say, with vehicles left burning in the streets. President AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador said the decision to cancel the arrest on Thursday had saved lives. Senior security officials had decided on his release, the president said at a news conference. ""The officials who took this decision did well,"" he said. ""The capture of a criminal is not worth more than people's lives."" 'A failure of everything' How Mexico's drug kingpin fell victim to his own legend El Chapo: Five things to know Shocking allegations in 'El Chapo' trial A lawyer for the GuzmÃ¡n family appeared before journalists and described the president as ""human"" and ""Christian"".

The kingpin was jailed earlier this year, and Ovidio GuzmÃ¡n LÃ³pez is one of several brothers with a hand in running the cartel. Thought to be in his twenties, he is accused of drug trafficking in the US. A patrol of National Guard militarised police came under intense fire from a house on Thursday afternoon, Security Minister Alfonso Durazo said. The security forces fought back and found Mr GuzmÃ¡n, but were then surrounded by gunmen and forced to retreat. Defence Minister Luis Cresencio Sandoval told reporters the operation had been ""badly planned"". Five cartel members and a National Guard policeman are among the dead, he said. Fighters also attacked security forces in other parts of CuliacÃ¡n and bodies were seen on the streets. Witnesses described scenes of panic in the city, a stronghold of the Sinaloa cartel, as families with small children fled from gunfire. Trucks were set alight in the streets to block roads Footage on social media showed a pick-up truck with a machine gun mounted on the back, in scenes reminiscent of a war zone. Fifty-one inmates escaped from Aguaruto prison during the disorder.

Thought to be in his twenties, he is accused of drug trafficking in the US. A patrol of National Guard militarised police came under intense fire from a house on Thursday afternoon, Security Minister Alfonso Durazo said. The security forces fought back and found Mr GuzmÃ¡n, but were then surrounded by gunmen and forced to retreat. Defence Minister Luis Cresencio Sandoval told reporters the operation had been ""badly planned"". Five cartel members and a National Guard policeman are among the dead, he said. Fighters also attacked security forces in other parts of CuliacÃ¡n and bodies were seen on the streets. Witnesses described scenes of panic in the city, a stronghold of the Sinaloa cartel, as families with small children fled from gunfire. Trucks were set alight in the streets to block roads Footage on social media showed a pick-up truck with a machine gun mounted on the back, in scenes reminiscent of a war zone. Fifty-one inmates escaped from Aguaruto prison during the disorder. The Sinaloa state government told residents to remain calm and stay off the streets After the mayhem: The scene on Friday Other footage showed families scrambling to take cover under cars and in shops as bullets flew. In one video, a girl asked her father: ""Why are they shooting bullets?"" A purported mugshot taken of Mr GuzmÃ¡n while he was detained by police was shared widely on social media.

"This video can not be played Watch clashes between Mexico's security forces and drug cartel members Heavy fighting broke out in northern Mexico on Thursday after security forces detained a son of the jailed drug kingpin JoaquÃ­n ""El Chapo"" GuzmÃ¡n. Fighting raged for hours after Ovidio GuzmÃ¡n LÃ³pez was found in what authorities said was a routine patrol in the city of CuliacÃ¡n. Armed men were seen firing on police with bodies strewn in the road. Police withdrew without Mr GuzmÃ¡n in their custody to avoid further violence, officials said. How Mexico's drug kingpin fell victim to his own legend El Chapo: Five things to know Shocking allegations in 'El Chapo' trial Mexico's security minister, Alfonso Durazo, told Reuters news agency that a patrol of National Guard militarised police came under intense fire from outside the house where they had located Mr GuzmÃ¡n, forcing them to retreat from the building for their own safety and ""to recover calm in the city"". A lawyer for the GuzmÃ¡n family told the Associated Press, ""Ovidio is alive and free.""

With the kingpin now behind bars, the cartel is said to be partially controlled by Ovidio GuzmÃ¡n Lopez, who is accused of drug trafficking in the US and believed to be in his twenties.

"This video can not be played On the road with police trying to stop ""county lines"" drugs gangs Police have made a record number of arrests in a week-long push to tackle so-called county lines drug gangs. Officers arrested 743 people and seized drugs worth over Â£400,000, 12 guns and dozens of other weapons. The operation, by forces across England and Wales, resulted in the ""disruption"" of 49 ""deal lines"", police said. Senior officers say better co-ordination between police forces means they know more than they've ever done about the gangs and their activities. County lines drugs gangs use dedicated phone lines to send mass texts to customers and organise networks of couriers, often children and vulnerable adults, to move the drugs from cities to smaller towns. These phone lines are branded with a gang's name, allowing customers to place orders but the dealers, based in distant cities, remain anonymous to avoid getting caught. Liverpool to north Wales: Up close with a county line Drug crime mapped What is County Lines? Overall, 652 men and 91 women were arrested in the so-called National Week of Intensification which began on 7 October, the highest number in any week of co-ordinated police activity against county lines gangs. The push was led by teams dedicated to fighting organised drug dealing, backed up by uniformed officers expert in pursuing and stopping cars. The operation also made use of intelligence from theNational Crime Agency,externaland automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) cameras which are being used to spot dealers moving drugs from major cities to the location where they are being sold. Senior officers say in recent years the lines, and the use of young people to move the drugs, have become the predominant ""business model"" for drug dealing. ""We know more than we have ever known about the gangs and those people who get exploited as part of county lines activity,"" said Deputy Assistant Commissioner Duncan Ball, from the National Police Chiefs' Council. He said better intelligence was the result of police forces working more closely together. ""We're resolved to tackle the gang leaders and tackle them hard,"" he added. The BBC was given access to theWest Midlands Police Regional Organised Crime Unit,externalas it tried to stop gangs operating between Birmingham and Worcestershire. In Aston, Birmingham, covert officers were on the streets in large numbers looking for gang leaders and drugs couriers. Traffic patrols trained in high-speed pursuit techniques followed one car which crashed, breaching a gas main. The car breached a gas main Officers had to swiftly clear the street while trying to find the suspect. At least one county line is suspected to be moving drugs from Birmingham to the town of Droitwich in Worcestershire. The police believe this single line is making Â£4,000 a day. The West Midlands team followed the drugs to their destination and lay in wait for the dealers with the help of West Mercia Police. Eventually a car was picked up by an automatic number plate reading camera outside Birmingham, heading to the area. The suspects reportedly switched cars before police mounted a high-speed ""hard stop"" on a busy rural road and arrested them. West Midlands police carried out simultaneous raids on Friday 11 October in Tipton, Birmingham, targeting a county line linking Birmingham and Hereford. A knife and samurai sword were found in a flat. County lines gangs are a challenge for police because they cause significant harm to the young people caught up in their activities - many are groomed to carry drugs and go missing from home. Sgt Jen Edwards, who leads the relatively new West Midlands Police team, called the gangs ""heartless and cruel"". ""They do not see these children as vulnerable children, they see them as a commodity, and a way of using them to make them more money."" Sgt Jen Edwards called the gangs heartless and cruel Supt Rich Agar, who leads the West Midlands Police county lines operation. said: ""They don't get their hands dirty. ""They don't carry the drugs, they don't have the weapons used for enforcement. They use vulnerable adults and children. ""The people at the bottom get caught and go to prison."" Police are increasingly using co-ordinated operations to tackle the gangs. A knife found during one of the raids During the intensification week, senior officers compared notes on a daily basis to ensure intelligence was shared. The government has announced it will expand the newCounty Lines Co-ordination Centre,externalset up to provide oversight.

"Fighting has been going on for 40 years - most Afghans can't remember a time of peace After 20 years of war, the Taliban has swept to victory in Afghanistan. The group completedtheir shockingly rapid advance across the countryby capturing Kabul on 15 August. It came after foreign forces withdrew from Afghanistan following a deal between the US and the Taliban, two decades after US forces removed the militants from power in 2001. The conflict has killed tens of thousands of people and displaced millions. Taliban forces have pledged not to allow Afghanistan to become a base for terrorists who could threaten the West. But questions are already being asked about how the group will govern the country, and what their rule means for women, human rights, and political freedoms. Back in 2001, the US was responding tothe 9/11 attacks on New York and Washington, in which nearly 3,000 people were killed. Officials identified Islamist militant group al-Qaeda, and its leader Osama Bin Laden, as responsible. Bin Laden was in Afghanistan, under the protection of the Taliban, the Islamists who had been in power since 1996. When they refused to hand him over, the US intervened militarily, quickly removing the Taliban and vowing to support democracy and eliminate the terrorist threat. The Afghan conflict became America's longest war The militants slipped away and later regrouped. Nato allies had joined the US and a new Afghan government took over in 2004 but deadly Taliban attacks continued. President Barack Obama's ""troop surge"" in 2009 helped push back the Taliban but it was not long term. In 2014, at the end of what was the bloodiest year since 2001, Nato's international forces ended their combat mission, leaving responsibility for security to the Afghan army. That gave the Taliban momentum and they seized more territory. Peace talks between the US and the Taliban started tentatively, with the Afghan government pretty much uninvolved, and the agreement on a withdrawal came in February 2020 in Qatar. The US-Taliban deal did not stop the Taliban attacks - they switched their focus instead to Afghan security forces and civilians, and targeted assassinations. Their areas of control grew. From 9/11, to intense fighting on the ground, and now full withdrawal of US-led forces, hereâs what happened. 11 September 2001 Al-Qaeda, led by Osama Bin Laden in Afghanistan, carries out the largest terror attack ever conducted on US soil. Four commercial airliners are hijacked. Two are flown into the World Trade Centre in New York, which collapses. One hits the Pentagon building in Washington, and one crashes into a field in Pennsylvania. Nearly 3,000 people are killed. 7 October 2001 A US-led coalition bombs Taliban and al-Qaeda facilities in Afghanistan. Targets include Kabul, Kandahar and Jalalabad. The Taliban, who took power after a decade-long Soviet occupation was followed by civil war, refuse to hand over Bin Laden. Their air defences and small fleet of fighter aircraft are destroyed. 13 November 2001 The Northern Alliance, a group of anti-Taliban rebels backed by coalition forces, enters Kabul as the Taliban flee the city. By the 13 November 2001, all Taliban have either fled or been neutralised. Other cities quickly fall. 26 January 2004 After protracted negotiations at a “loya jirga” or grand assembly, the new Afghan constitution is signed into law. The constitution paves the way for presidential elections in October 2004. 7 December 2004 Hamid Karzai, the leader of the Popalzai Durrani tribe, becomes the first president under the new constitution. He serves two five-year terms as president. May 2006 British troops arrive in Helmand province, a Taliban stronghold in the south of the country. Their initial mission is to support reconstruction projects, but they are quickly drawn into combat operations. More than 450 British troops lose their lives in Afghanistan over the course of the conflict. 17 February 2009 US President Barack Obama approves a major increase in the number of troops sent to Afghanistan. At their peak, they number about 140,000. The so-called “surge” is modelled on US strategy in Iraq where US forces focussed on protecting the civilian population as well as killing insurgent fighters. 2 May 2011 The leader of al-Qaeda is killed in an assault by US Navy Seals on a compound in Abbottabad in Pakistan. Bin Ladenâs body is removed and buried at sea. The operation ends a 10-year hunt led by the CIA. Â The confirmation that Bin Laden had been living on Pakistani soil fuels accusations in the US that Pakistan is an unreliable ally in the war on terror. 23 April 2013 The founder of the Taliban, Mullah Mohammed Omar, dies. His death is kept secret for more than two years. According to Afghan intelligence, Mullah Omar dies of health problems at a hospital in the Pakistani city of Karachi. Pakistan denies that he was in the country. 28 December 2014 At a ceremony in Kabul, Nato ends its combat operations in Afghanistan. With the surge now over, the US withdraws thousands of troops. Â Most of those who remain focus on training and supporting the Afghan security forces. 2015 The Taliban launch a series of suicide attacks, car bombings and other assaults. The parliament building in Kabul, and the city of Kunduz are attacked. Islamic State militants begin operations in Afghanistan. 25 January 2019 Afghan President Ashraf Ghani says more than 45,000 members of his countryâs security forces have been killed since he became leader in 2014. The figure is far higher than previously thought. 29 February 2020 The US and the Taliban sign an “agreement for bringing peace” to Afghanistan, in Doha, Qatar. The US and Nato allies agree to withdraw all troops within 14 months if the militants uphold the deal. 13 April 2021 US president Joe Biden announces that all US troops will leave Afghanistan by 11 September 2021. 16 August 2021 In just over a month, the Taliban sweep across Afghanistan, taking control of towns and cities all over the country, including Kabul. Afghan security forces collapse in the face of the Taliban advance. They emerged in the civil war that followed the withdrawal of Soviet troops in 1989, predominantly in the south-west and the Pakistan border areas. This video can not be played Full interview: Taliban spokesman Suhail Shaheen speaks to the BBC's Yalda Hakim They vowed to fight corruption and improve security, but also followed an austere form of Islam. By 1998, they had taken control of almost all of the country. What has the conflict cost the US? In numbers: Life in Afghanistan as US leaves Who's who in the Taliban leadership When the BBC visited the Taliban They enforced their own hardline version of Sharia, or Islamic law, and introduced brutal punishments. Men were made to grow beards and women had to wear the all-covering burka. TV, music and cinema were banned. After their overthrow they regrouped in Pakistani border areas. In terms of lives lost, it is obviously not easy to say exactly. The number of coalition casualties is much better recorded than Taliban and Afghan civilians. Research by Brown University estimates losses in the Afghan security forces at 69,000. It puts the number of civilians and militants killed at about 51,000 each. More than 3,500 coalition soldiers have died since 2001 - about two-thirds of them Americans. More than 20,000 US soldiers have been injured. According to the UN, Afghanistan has the third-largest displaced population in the world. Since 2012, some five million people have fled and not been able to return home, either displaced within Afghanistan or taking refuge in neighbouring countries. Brown University research also puts the US spending on the conflict - including military and reconstruction funds in both Afghanistan and Pakistan - at $978bn (Â£706bn) up to 2020. How the Taliban plan to govern Afghanistan remains unclear. Women face an uncertain future. Taliban spokesman Suhail Shaheen says the group will respect the rights of women and minorities ""as per Afghan norms and Islamic values"". The militants had declared an amnesty across Afghanistan and said it wanted women to join its government. But there are fears over women's freedom to work, to dress as they choose, or even to leave home alone under Taliban rule. During the 1990s the Taliban forced women to dress in certain ways and denied them equal rights Another major fear is that the country will once again become a training ground for terrorism. Taliban officials insist that they will fully adhere to the US deal and prevent any group from using Afghan soil as a base for attacks against the US and its allies. They say they aim only to implement an ""Islamic government"" and will not pose a threat to any other country. But many analysts say the Taliban and al-Qaeda are inseparable, with the latter's fighters heavily embedded and engaged in training activity. It is also important to remember that the Taliban are not a centralised and unified force. Some leaders may want to keep the West muted by not stirring up trouble but hardliners may be reluctant to break links with al-Qaeda. Just how powerful al-Qaeda is and whether it could now rebuild its global network is also unclear. Then there is the regional branch of the Islamic State group - ISKP (Khorasan Province) - which the Taliban oppose. Like al-Qaeda, ISKP has been degraded by the US and Nato but could use the post-withdrawal period to regroup. Its fighter numbers could be only between a few hundred and 2,000 but it may try to gain footholds in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and parts of Tajikistan, which could be a serious regional concern.

"Sean Dixon, co-founder of Richard James, says the Savile Row tailor feels ""a bit like collateral damage"". He and the other bespoke tailoring firms who line the world-famous London street feel bruised because, from Friday, every suit they sell to the US faces a new export tax of 25%. They are on a list of products the US is targeting with tariffs in retaliation for the EU giving illegal subsidies to plane-maker Airbus. And it has left Savile Row reeling. ""I don't think anybody on the street was aware of [the tariff],"" says James Sleater, founder and director of Savile Row's newest tailor, Cad & the Dandy, whose clients include British rapper Stormzy and rugby player Mike Tindall. ""Conversations about Airbus and [US President Donald] Trump and Savile Row are not normally three words that go hand in hand,"" he says. Why a row over jets could raise the cost of whisky 'Special relationship' won't guarantee UK-US trade Q&A: What impact will US tariffs have on Scotch whisky? Brexit: What trade deals has the UK done so far? The street has had little time to prepare for the tariff, which almost doubles the tax on an exported suit from roughly 13% to 25%. On 2 October, the World Trade Organisation (WTO) gave the US permission to impose taxes on $7.5bn (Â£5.8bn) of goods it imports from the EU. Savile Row is famous for its bespoke suits It was the latest chapter in a long-running battle between Washington and Brussels over illegal subsidies given to planemakers Airbus and rival Boeing. That same day, the US published the list of EU products that would face the new taxes, including men's woollen suits made in the UK, as well as cashmere knitwear and Scotch whisky - and told businesses the tariffs would come into force on 18 October. The tariffs come at a crucial time for the UK, which is preparing to leave the EU and strike trade deals with other nations, including the US. International Trade Secretary Liz Truss says: ""Resorting to tit-for-tat tariffs is not in any country's best interests and we are in regular contact with the Trump administration, urging them to refrain from resorting to such measures. ""As well as causing temporary disruption to UK businesses, it would also hit American consumers in the pocket."" Kathryn Sargent, Savile Row's first female master tailor, is concerned that her clients in the US, who make up a third of her business, may not be aware of the new tax. She travels to cities such as New York, Chicago and Washington DC three times a year to visit customers, show them fabrics and do fittings for her suits, which start at about Â£5,500. Kathryn Sargent is Savile Row's first female master tailor ""It is a conversation that I'll be having with my clients when I'm over there, to sense what their reaction is and to see if it puts them off placing future orders,"" she says. North America is an important market for Savile Row, as well as the wider British luxury industry. Mr Sleater reckons that total sales of the street's goods into the US total some Â£40m. The US is also the second largest export market, behind Europe, for UK luxury products, according to Walpole, the trade body for the British luxury sector, and Frontier Economics. But it is not just the business connection between the two countries that is important to Savile Row's tailors. ""All the past US presidents have had garments made in Savile Row,"" says Ms Sargent. ""When you think of all the Hollywood greats like Fred Astaire and Cary Grant, there is a beautiful relationship between Savile Row and America, so this tariff really hits us hard."" She hopes that her US clients' ""love of British quality craftsmanship"" will overcome any concerns about the added cost of buying a Savile Row suit. Fred Astaire, seen here with Audrey Hepburn while filming Funny Face, was a fan of Savile Row suits Small bespoke tailoring firms like Ms Sargent's will not be able to absorb the cost of the tax. Mr Dixon says that Richard James, one of the few Savile Row tailors with a store in the US, says it will do its best to absorb the cost: ""But we think there will be a priceâ¦ we will have to pass some of this on to our customers."" Arguably, the type of people who have a bespoke suit made by a Savile Row tailor are not short of a pound or two. ""The customer base is fairly affluent,"" admits Mr Dixon, whose clients include actor Benedict Cumberbatch, footballer David Beckham and rapper P Diddy. ""Nevertheless, an increase is an increase and we pride ourselves on people getting value for money, especially for a Savile Row suit. ""The amount of man-hours that go into it, the incredible fabrics used and a suit that can last 20 years or 30 years and then to have a big part of that being paid in tax. I don't know how people are going to feel about that."" While Savile Row's tailors were shocked by the tariffs, Walpole was not. Helen Brocklebank, CEO of Walpole ""We're disappointed, of course,"" says Helen Brocklebank, Walpole's chief executive. ""But we're not surprised that suiting and textiles and fine fabrics came so heavily top of the list."" She says that UK luxury goods such as cashmere sweaters have often been targeted by the US in trade tussles. Cad & the Dandy dressed Mike Tindall for his marriage wedding to Zara Phillips, daughter of Princess Anne, in 2011 In 1999, when Bill Clinton was in the White House, Scottish cashmere sweaters faced sanctions following a WTO ruling in a row between the US and the UK about bananas. But Ms Brocklebank does not think this latest round of tariffs will have a major impact on sales of UK luxury goods. ""You have quite a weak pound at the moment and the number of US visitors coming to the UK to shop for these kinds of goods is at an all-time high, so I don't think that the impact is going to be enormous,"" she says. President Trump, who reportedly favours suits made by Italy's Brioni, described the WTO ruling at the beginning of October as a ""big win"" for the US. But his jubilation - and any pain felt by UK businesses - may be short-lived. Actor Benedict Cumberbatch wore a Richard James suit to Wimbledon this year Ms Brocklebank points out that next spring, the WTO will rule on Boeing, the US planemaker, which it found had benefited from tax breaks. The EU could then be given the green light to enforce its own tariffs on US goods. Mr Sleater says that while Cad & the Dandy was caught unaware by the new taxes, Savile Row should use the opportunity to elevate its brand, which has historically always been about understatement. He says that while Italy's suitmakers - who are not facing US tariffs - have actively promoted their industry, Savile Row has not. ""The key thing about this is to stomach the tariffs being placed on us and - I'm talking about the street here - we somehow need to find a way to make our clothes even more appealing. ""Never before has there been such a time when branding is really, really important.""

"The restaurant in Reading's Oracle shopping centre opened on 10 October A US fast-food chain will cease trading at its first UK outlet amid a row over donations to anti-LGBT groups. Gay rights campaigners called for a boycott of Chick-fil-A, which opened its first branch at The Oracle shopping centre in Reading on 10 October. A spokeswoman for the centre said ""the right thing to do"" was to not extend the restaurant's lease beyond the ""six-month pilot period"". Chick-fil-A said its donations were purely focused on youth and education. The family-owned company, founded in Atlanta in 1967, is one of the biggest fast-food chains in the USA and boasts about 2,400 outlets across North America. According to US news website Think Progress,in 2017 the Chick-fil-A Foundation donated millions of dollars,externalto the Fellowship of Christian Athletes, the Paul Anderson Youth Home and the US Salvation Army. Campaigners from LGBT organisation, Reading Pride, said all three organisations have a reputation of being hostile to LGBT rights. In 2012, the company's chairman sparked a US boycott when he said he opposed gay marriage. The Oracle said: ""We always look to introduce new concepts for our customers, however, we have decided on this occasion that the right thing to do is to only allow Chick-Fil-A to trade with us for the initial six-month pilot period, and not to extend the lease any further."" Reading Pride said The Oracle's decision was ""good news"", adding the six-month period was a ""reasonable request... to allow for re-settlement and notice for employees that have moved from other jobs"". But the organisation said it would continue to campaign against the outlet until it left. Chick-fil-A had previously told the BBC: ""Our giving has always focused on youth and education. We have never donated with the purpose of supporting a social or political agenda. ""There are 145,000 people - black, white; gay, straight; Christian, non-Christian - who represent Chick-fil-A."" In a statement, the UK Salvation Army said it ""strongly objected to being presented as homophobic or transphobic"", adding that it had LGBT+ members and served people ""without discrimination"".

"Canadians go to the polls on 21 October, four years after Justin Trudeau's Liberal Party swept to power. But things aren't as clear-cut this time around, with several other parties rising in the polls. Here's a visual look at some key issues and themes which could shape the outcome on election night. The focus of campaigning tends to be on the party leaders and who will be prime minister. But in reality, under Canada's system of government, it's 338 separate races, with candidates in each of the country's federal ridings (constituencies) from coast to coast to coast. They are all fighting for their chance to sit in Canada's House of Commons - which loosely resembles its British namesake. There are two scenarios - a majority and a minority government (or hung parliament). If one party wins 170 seats or more, Canada will have a majority government. In 2015, Justin Trudeau and his Liberal candidates won 184 seats - a solid majority. Minority governments are formed when no party wins more than half the seats. A minority government is typically, but not necessarily, formed by the party that has the most seats - but it needs the support of other parties to pass legislation. Election 43 will also see the largest number of female candidates running ever, with 651 female candidates across all parties. That represents a 9% increase from 2015, according to Equal Voice Canada. Equal Voice says it's a ""great stride"", although there remains work to do. ""If every single woman elected in the history of Canada were to sit together in the House today, they would not fill the Chamber's 338 seats,"" the group said in a statement. ""Following this election, we expect that will finally change."" Health care is a perennial concern for Canadian voters. But amid a push for governments around the world do to more the tackle the issue, climate change has been dominating as one of the issues that matters most to voters. Mr Trudeau made meeting the Paris Accord targets a cornerstone of his campaign in 2015, and his record will be judged at the ballot box. The decision by his Liberal government to buy the Trans Mountain Pipeline, which would carry crude oil from Alberta to British Columbia, in order to ensure a project to triple its capacity goes ahead, has also faced criticism. Despite low unemployment and modest economic growth, Canadians are feeling anxious about their economic future. The cost of living has been identified as a priority in this campaign and all the federal parties are rolling out policies aimed at making life more affordable for Canadian families, from tax relief to making it easier for first-time homebuyers to get into the housing market - especially in booming cities like Toronto and Vancouver. The results of Monday's election will be largely decided in three key, vote-rich regions: Quebec, the Greater Toronto Area, and in Lower Mainland British Columbia. Sorry, your browser cannot display this map Here we look at one - the province of Quebec - where the vote has been volatile in recent years. This election is no different. Going into the campaign's final days, the Bloc Quebecois - a federal party focused on Quebec sovereignty - is in a strong second place and nipping at the Liberals' heels. Quebec voters are taking another look at a party - which only runs candidates in that province - they had relegated to the sidelines in the past two elections. The Conservatives, who are tied with the Liberals in national polls, are trailing in third. And while the left-leaning NDPs have momentum in other parts of the country, they haven't gained much traction in Quebec and could lose most of the 14 seats they hold there. Canada is a vast nation, with large swathes of wilderness. This can be a challenge for traditional door-to-door campaigning. Canada's largest federal riding in geographical terms, Nunavut, is the size of seven United Kingdoms. In comparison, a candidate could easily walk Canada's smallest riding - Toronto-Centre - in a matter of hours. By Jessica Murphy, Robin Levinson-King, Tom Housden, Sumi Senthinathan and Mark Bryson.

"This video can not be played On the road with police trying to stop ""county lines"" drugs gangs Police have made a record number of arrests in a week-long push to tackle so-called county lines drug gangs. Officers arrested 743 people and seized drugs worth over Â£400,000, 12 guns and dozens of other weapons. The operation, by forces across England and Wales, resulted in the ""disruption"" of 49 ""deal lines"", police said. Senior officers say better co-ordination between police forces means they know more than they've ever done about the gangs and their activities. County lines drugs gangs use dedicated phone lines to send mass texts to customers and organise networks of couriers, often children and vulnerable adults, to move the drugs from cities to smaller towns. These phone lines are branded with a gang's name, allowing customers to place orders but the dealers, based in distant cities, remain anonymous to avoid getting caught. Liverpool to north Wales: Up close with a county line Drug crime mapped What is County Lines? Overall, 652 men and 91 women were arrested in the so-called National Week of Intensification which began on 7 October, the highest number in any week of co-ordinated police activity against county lines gangs. The push was led by teams dedicated to fighting organised drug dealing, backed up by uniformed officers expert in pursuing and stopping cars. The operation also made use of intelligence from theNational Crime Agency,externaland automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) cameras which are being used to spot dealers moving drugs from major cities to the location where they are being sold. Senior officers say in recent years the lines, and the use of young people to move the drugs, have become the predominant ""business model"" for drug dealing. ""We know more than we have ever known about the gangs and those people who get exploited as part of county lines activity,"" said Deputy Assistant Commissioner Duncan Ball, from the National Police Chiefs' Council. He said better intelligence was the result of police forces working more closely together. ""We're resolved to tackle the gang leaders and tackle them hard,"" he added. The BBC was given access to theWest Midlands Police Regional Organised Crime Unit,externalas it tried to stop gangs operating between Birmingham and Worcestershire. In Aston, Birmingham, covert officers were on the streets in large numbers looking for gang leaders and drugs couriers. Traffic patrols trained in high-speed pursuit techniques followed one car which crashed, breaching a gas main. The car breached a gas main Officers had to swiftly clear the street while trying to find the suspect. At least one county line is suspected to be moving drugs from Birmingham to the town of Droitwich in Worcestershire. The police believe this single line is making Â£4,000 a day. The West Midlands team followed the drugs to their destination and lay in wait for the dealers with the help of West Mercia Police. Eventually a car was picked up by an automatic number plate reading camera outside Birmingham, heading to the area. The suspects reportedly switched cars before police mounted a high-speed ""hard stop"" on a busy rural road and arrested them. West Midlands police carried out simultaneous raids on Friday 11 October in Tipton, Birmingham, targeting a county line linking Birmingham and Hereford. A knife and samurai sword were found in a flat. County lines gangs are a challenge for police because they cause significant harm to the young people caught up in their activities - many are groomed to carry drugs and go missing from home. Sgt Jen Edwards, who leads the relatively new West Midlands Police team, called the gangs ""heartless and cruel"". ""They do not see these children as vulnerable children, they see them as a commodity, and a way of using them to make them more money."" Sgt Jen Edwards called the gangs heartless and cruel Supt Rich Agar, who leads the West Midlands Police county lines operation. said: ""They don't get their hands dirty. ""They don't carry the drugs, they don't have the weapons used for enforcement. They use vulnerable adults and children. ""The people at the bottom get caught and go to prison."" Police are increasingly using co-ordinated operations to tackle the gangs. A knife found during one of the raids During the intensification week, senior officers compared notes on a daily basis to ensure intelligence was shared. The government has announced it will expand the newCounty Lines Co-ordination Centre,externalset up to provide oversight. Police and the Home Office are also considering whether new laws could target the way county lines gangs send mass text messages to their customers to advertise drugs.

"A 25% tariff on single malt Scotch whisky exports to the United States is being introduced on Friday. The new duty is among measures being imposed by theUS in retaliation against EU subsidies given to aircraft maker Airbus. Other goods being targeted,externalinclude cashmere sweaters and sweet biscuits. Here, BBC Scotland looks at the scale of the Scotch whisky market in the US and the potential impact on sales of whisky and other Scottish products across the pond. According to analysis of HMRC figures by the Scotch Whisky Association (SWA), Scotch exports to America last year were worth $1.3bn (Â£1bn). Single malts represented 33% of that. The US market accounted for 22% of global value and 10.7% of global volumes of Scotch whisky exports. Of 137 million bottles of Scotch exported to the US in 2018, just under 25 million were single malts. It is hard to estimate just how big a hit Scotch whisky producers could take, but the industry - which employs about 11,000 people in Scotland - is worried. The SWA has noted that European Union imports of US whiskey fell by about 20% after the EU imposed a 25% tariff on the import of bourbon last year. It expects single malt whisky to experience a similar drop over the next 12 months as Scotch becomes less competitive in the US market. SWA chief executive Karen Betts added: ""In time, consumer choice will diminish and Scotch whisky companies will start to lose market share. ""In Scotland and throughout our UK supply chain, we expect to see a dropping-off in investment and productivity. ""Ultimately, jobs could be at risk."" She said: ""We now need the UK and Scottish governments to work together to ensure distillers can weather the storm. ""We want them to consider a range of support to the industry, including reducing the UK tax burden on Scotch whisky in the autumn Budget."" At least one distillery said it was reconsidering plans to increase its exports to the US, as a result of the new duty. Speyside Distillers currently sends 60,000 bottles of Spey single malt to America each year. Managing director Patricia Dillon told the BBC: ""Because of the 25% tariffs that have been implemented in the US, this is something that we can't possibly absorb into our business so what we have to do is reconsider the market in the US that we are currently in."" Patricia Dillon said her company was reconsidering its plans for the US Industry experts also expect single malt sales in the US to take a hit as a result of the new duty. Alan Gray, author of the Scotch Whisky Industry Review, said: ""Obviously the tariffs will have implications for sales. ""There are well off people who may not think too much about the price of a premium malt but many will look at it and decide whether or not they want to pay more. ""One good example is minimum pricing for alcohol which increased prices for many blends. This had a negative effect on sales in the UK because there is price sensitivity."" Moray-based Walkers Shortbread, which is Britain's biggest exporter of sweet biscuits, described the new duty as a ""very great concern"". According to joint managing director Jim Walker, the company exported 5,000 tonnes of shortbread - more than a 10th of its total production - to America last year. Mr Walker said that with 1,600 people employed in Aberlour for the peak period leading up to Christmas, the firm would continue production and may scale down for the new year. About half of the festive season stock has already been delivered to the US, so has avoided tariffs. Mr Walker also said no decisions been made about pricing, and whether the manufacturer, the importing companies or the customer would have to absorb the 25% tariff. He added: ""We just hope that it won't be permanent. It could be that they run this for six months or a year, and then rotate it to something different. But it's a very great concern. ""We can only hope we can overcome it and do the best to protect the business and protect jobs."" Johnstons of Elgin, the largest manufacturer of cashmere knitwear in the UK, has also expressed concern over the imposition of a 25% tariff on its sector. The US is its third largest market behind Europe and Japan. Johnstons of Elgin is the largest manufacturer of cashmere knitwear in the UK Chief executive Simon Cotton said: ""In the very short term we are going to have to absorb these costs because we can't expect people to pay more for products they have already ordered. ""In the longer term this is going to hit consumers in the US, and that it is going to mean that their cashmere is going to become more expensive. ""That, in turn, means we will be able to export less, grow less and will have to downscale our plans."" On Thursday, UK Government Minister for Scotland Colin Clark said he was ""deeply disappointed"" by their imminent introduction. He added: ""These tariffs will not only have a significant impact on the export of aircraft and whisky but on many great Scottish industries such as textiles, including cashmere, and biscuits. ""The UK government has raised the issue at the highest levels with both the EU and the US, including with President Trump, and will continue to do so until these tariffs are dropped.""

"Does feeding bread to ducks help them or harm them? A mysterious sign encouraging people to feed bread to ""starving"" ducks has stirred up confusion and angry debate about whether or not it is harmful. The official-looking sign appeared in the Pavilion Gardens in Buxton, Derbyshire, but the park's managers insisted they were not responsible. A mother who put a photo of the sign on Facebook was inundated with messages demanding she remove her post. She has since deleted it, after the post was shared more than 17,000 times. ""I honestly thought I was doing a good deed,"" said Louisa Taylor. ""I have two young children so I really don't need the stress of it all."" The BBC asked various experts and they disagreed with each other too. The sign appeared in Pavilion Gardens in Buxton, Derbyshire, but has since been removed The photo - which was taken by one of Ms Taylor's friends - has appeared in thousands of Facebook timelines after being posted on multiple ""Spotted"" pages. One commenter said: ""How do people in this day and age still find it so difficult to do something as simple as feed ducks something other than bread!"" Another said: ""Generations of people have fed ducks stale bread for years!! I see no decline in the duck population, just bloody feed them."" One woman said she and her husband were publicly told off by a stranger for feeding bread to ducks. The photo has also beenposted on Reddit,externalwith the title ""I'm confused about duck diet now"", and has had more than 39,000 upvotes. The woman who originally took the photo did not want to be named in this story because she feared a backlash for spreading incorrect information. ""There had been signs up the year before saying you can't feed bread to the ducks anymore, but then this sign was saying the ducks were dying and starving and I thought 'oh dear',"" she said. The RSPB said it was fine to feed water birds small amounts of bread ""I've got no idea who's put it up. It was only up for a few days and I haven't seen it since. ""It's quite confusing. If the advice is wrong then I don't really want to be responsible for putting it out there."" Feeding ducks bread - should you do it? Duck feeding Â£2,500 fine threat for Ely residents Peterborough's 'obese' ducks put on no-bread diet What was the experts' advice? The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) said it was fine to feed small amounts of bread to ducks but people should also feed them sweetcorn, porridge oats, peas and bird seed. ""Just like us, birds need a varied diet to stay healthy,"" said Tony Whitehead from the charity. ""Although ducks and swans can digest all types of bread, too much can leave them feeling full without giving them all of the important vitamins, minerals and nutrients they need. ""So, although bread isn't harmful, our advice is to only feed small amounts to birds."" This video can not be played Peter Birch: ""Still too much bread is being dumped in the waterways"" The Canal and River Trust has campaigned against feeding bread to ducks, and hasclaimed it is ""bad for ducks"",external. ""Uneaten soggy bread can cause a build-up of bad nutrients which can lead to greater algal growth, spread disease and encourage pests such as rats,"" it said. ""It [feeding bread] also creates excessive amounts of bird droppings which, along with being smelly and slippery underfoot, can reduce water quality and clog waterways with harmful algae."" This video can not be played A Berkshire charity says that misinformation has confused the public. Swan Support, which rescues swans, ducks and geese, said many were starving because people had stopped feeding them bread in recent years. They blamed a campaign called Ban the Bread, which was started by a company selling bird food. ""They wanted people to buy their food and that's where it all started,"" said Wendy Hermon from Swan Support. ""We were picking them up dying everywhere."" She said flocks of birds had become established in certain areas because of people feeding them and they had become reliant on this food supply. ""It's absolutely fine to feed bread. Bread has been fed to swans, ducks and geese for hundreds of years,"" she said. However, she said people should only throw in as much as the birds ate, so there was no excess bread left behind to decay. Wild duck food maker Quack Snacks said while a ""small amount of bread is unlikely to do ducks harm, it won't do them a lot of good either"". ""There are alternatives to bread that contain more nutrients for waterfowl,"" said founder Andrew Hemmings. ""As lots of people enjoy feeding the ducks it is hard to avoid them having too much bread, so it would be much better if people offered something more nutritious and only did so in small amounts."" Young birds ""need to learn to forage for plants and insects"" The Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust said bread was ""fine for water birds as long as it only forms a small part of their diet"". ""Moderation is especially important in the spring and summer when an unbalanced diet can cause developmental problems for growing young birds,"" said Peter Morris. ""But moderation is hard to judge when other well-meaning people may also be feeding bread to the same birds at other times."" He said feeding birds vegetables, wheat grain and specialist food was safer and healthier. Winter was the best time to feed water birds, he said, when natural vegetation would be in short supply. ""Additional food is less vital in spring and summer, when young birds need to learn to forage for plants and insects, for a balanced diet and good physical development,"" he said.

"Sean Dixon, co-founder of Richard James, says the Savile Row tailor feels ""a bit like collateral damage"". He and the other bespoke tailoring firms who line the world-famous London street feel bruised because, from Friday, every suit they sell to the US faces a new export tax of 25%. They are on a list of products the US is targeting with tariffs in retaliation for the EU giving illegal subsidies to plane-maker Airbus. And it has left Savile Row reeling. ""I don't think anybody on the street was aware of [the tariff],"" says James Sleater, founder and director of Savile Row's newest tailor, Cad & the Dandy, whose clients include British rapper Stormzy and rugby player Mike Tindall. ""Conversations about Airbus and [US President Donald] Trump and Savile Row are not normally three words that go hand in hand,"" he says. Why a row over jets could raise the cost of whisky 'Special relationship' won't guarantee UK-US trade Q&A: What impact will US tariffs have on Scotch whisky? Brexit: What trade deals has the UK done so far? The street has had little time to prepare for the tariff, which almost doubles the tax on an exported suit from roughly 13% to 25%. On 2 October, the World Trade Organisation (WTO) gave the US permission to impose taxes on $7.5bn (Â£5.8bn) of goods it imports from the EU. Savile Row is famous for its bespoke suits It was the latest chapter in a long-running battle between Washington and Brussels over illegal subsidies given to planemakers Airbus and rival Boeing. That same day, the US published the list of EU products that would face the new taxes, including men's woollen suits made in the UK, as well as cashmere knitwear and Scotch whisky - and told businesses the tariffs would come into force on 18 October. The tariffs come at a crucial time for the UK, which is preparing to leave the EU and strike trade deals with other nations, including the US. International Trade Secretary Liz Truss says: ""Resorting to tit-for-tat tariffs is not in any country's best interests and we are in regular contact with the Trump administration, urging them to refrain from resorting to such measures. ""As well as causing temporary disruption to UK businesses, it would also hit American consumers in the pocket."" Kathryn Sargent, Savile Row's first female master tailor, is concerned that her clients in the US, who make up a third of her business, may not be aware of the new tax. She travels to cities such as New York, Chicago and Washington DC three times a year to visit customers, show them fabrics and do fittings for her suits, which start at about Â£5,500. Kathryn Sargent is Savile Row's first female master tailor ""It is a conversation that I'll be having with my clients when I'm over there, to sense what their reaction is and to see if it puts them off placing future orders,"" she says. North America is an important market for Savile Row, as well as the wider British luxury industry. Mr Sleater reckons that total sales of the street's goods into the US total some Â£40m. The US is also the second largest export market, behind Europe, for UK luxury products, according to Walpole, the trade body for the British luxury sector, and Frontier Economics. But it is not just the business connection between the two countries that is important to Savile Row's tailors. ""All the past US presidents have had garments made in Savile Row,"" says Ms Sargent. ""When you think of all the Hollywood greats like Fred Astaire and Cary Grant, there is a beautiful relationship between Savile Row and America, so this tariff really hits us hard."" She hopes that her US clients' ""love of British quality craftsmanship"" will overcome any concerns about the added cost of buying a Savile Row suit. Fred Astaire, seen here with Audrey Hepburn while filming Funny Face, was a fan of Savile Row suits Small bespoke tailoring firms like Ms Sargent's will not be able to absorb the cost of the tax. Mr Dixon says that Richard James, one of the few Savile Row tailors with a store in the US, says it will do its best to absorb the cost: ""But we think there will be a priceâ¦ we will have to pass some of this on to our customers."" Arguably, the type of people who have a bespoke suit made by a Savile Row tailor are not short of a pound or two. ""The customer base is fairly affluent,"" admits Mr Dixon, whose clients include actor Benedict Cumberbatch, footballer David Beckham and rapper P Diddy. ""Nevertheless, an increase is an increase and we pride ourselves on people getting value for money, especially for a Savile Row suit. ""The amount of man-hours that go into it, the incredible fabrics used and a suit that can last 20 years or 30 years and then to have a big part of that being paid in tax. I don't know how people are going to feel about that."" While Savile Row's tailors were shocked by the tariffs, Walpole was not. Helen Brocklebank, CEO of Walpole ""We're disappointed, of course,"" says Helen Brocklebank, Walpole's chief executive. ""But we're not surprised that suiting and textiles and fine fabrics came so heavily top of the list."" She says that UK luxury goods such as cashmere sweaters have often been targeted by the US in trade tussles. Cad & the Dandy dressed Mike Tindall for his marriage wedding to Zara Phillips, daughter of Princess Anne, in 2011 In 1999, when Bill Clinton was in the White House, Scottish cashmere sweaters faced sanctions following a WTO ruling in a row between the US and the UK about bananas. But Ms Brocklebank does not think this latest round of tariffs will have a major impact on sales of UK luxury goods. ""You have quite a weak pound at the moment and the number of US visitors coming to the UK to shop for these kinds of goods is at an all-time high, so I don't think that the impact is going to be enormous,"" she says. President Trump, who reportedly favours suits made by Italy's Brioni, described the WTO ruling at the beginning of October as a ""big win"" for the US. But his jubilation - and any pain felt by UK businesses - may be short-lived. Actor Benedict Cumberbatch wore a Richard James suit to Wimbledon this year Ms Brocklebank points out that next spring, the WTO will rule on Boeing, the US planemaker, which it found had benefited from tax breaks. The EU could then be given the green light to enforce its own tariffs on US goods. Mr Sleater says that while Cad & the Dandy was caught unaware by the new taxes, Savile Row should use the opportunity to elevate its brand, which has historically always been about understatement. He says that while Italy's suitmakers - who are not facing US tariffs - have actively promoted their industry, Savile Row has not. ""The key thing about this is to stomach the tariffs being placed on us and - I'm talking about the street here - we somehow need to find a way to make our clothes even more appealing. ""Never before has there been such a time when branding is really, really important.""

"No better outcome than my deal, Johnson says It now needs the approval of the UK and European parliaments However, the DUP has said it will not vote for it The UK Parliament will sit on Saturday and vote on the deal then The PM needs 320 MPs to back him for it to be approved Scottish court has dismissed a bid to stop 'illegal' Brexit deal Mary O'Connor and Sam Tonkin We are going to bring our live coverage to an end here. But we will be back early tomorrow to cover the proceedings in Parliament, which will be sitting on a Saturday for the first time in 37 years and it promises to be an historic occasion. Boris Johnson has spent the day trying to convince MPs to support his Brexit deal, ahead of what is expected to be a knife-edge vote. MPs will gather in the Commons at 09:30 BST for the main debate on the deal - with the voting likely to begin after 14:30 BST. You can read all about what to expect from the sittinghere. In the meantime, ournews storywill continue to be updated with the latest developments.  BBC Radio 5 Live Boris Johnson's deal is MPs' chance to put Brexit ""to bed"", says Conservative MP Tobias Ellwood. Asked what will happen if the deal is not approved, he says: ""There will be a pause for us to then take stock. ""The Benn Act has been put in place to allow that time to consider what does happen next, but the damage this will do for the further debates and discussions with the EU will be unhelpful."" Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage adds that Boris Johnson's deal is ""the second worst"" in history after Theresa May's and ""not worth voting for"". Speaking at his party's rally in Westminster, Mr Farage urged MPs to ""put country before party, vote this deal down and be heroes in the eyes of those who believe in democracy.""  Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage says Boris Johnson's deal is a ""re-heating of Theresa May's deal"" and ""will not get Brexit done"". Speaking at a party rally at Westminster's Queen Elizabeth II centre, Mr Farage says: ""Boris calls it a great new deal. ""It isnât new, because 95% of that withdrawal agreement is exactly
the same as that put by the Commons by Theresa May and voted down three times. ""It is a re-heating of Mrs Mayâs EU treaty and the attempt to
put lipstick on the pig, and I hope and believe the House of Commons and British
public wonât buy it at the fourth time of asking."" The Brexit Party has held a series of rallies in Watford, Camborne in Cornwall, and London's Westminster in the lead up to the 31 October Brexit deadline. Here are the possible outcomes of a vote on theLetwin amendment, which would withhold approval of the dealuntil the legislation to enact it was safely passed. Ian Paisley concludes his speech to the Brexit Party rally: ""We are here for the long term. ""We are here to stay. ""No surrender."" DUP MP Ian Paisley is speaking at a Brexit Party rally. He thanks the party for ""standing with us"" and for ""demonstrating fidelity to the union"". ""And, for not so easily letting go when things become difficult and keeping faith with the Ulster people."" He says the Brexit deal ""will leave part of our union behind"".

Laura KuenssbergBBC political editor It really is extremely tight. It would be foolish to make a guess on which way it will go. What we do know might happen tomorrow is rather than there being a thumbs up or thumbs down vote to the deal, there could be an attempt by some MPs to bring in what they see as an insurance policy. This could mean another delay in case this deal falls through in the next couple of weeks. That is potentially being put forward as an amendment so MPs will have a chance to vote on it. Without going in to all the potential machinations it could mean tomorrow turns, not just into MPs giving an opinion on Boris Johnson's deal, but also wrangling again about a potential delay. This could make things more fuzzy, and certainly more frustrating for Downing Street. It will be a showdown of sorts. It is only a week since Downing Street began seriously to believe that they might get this deal over the line. But they always knew that Parliament would be a very tricky hurdle. BBC News Channel Labour MP for Wakefield Mary Creagh says she will be voting against the deal. ""People have told me they want their vote back, they want to vote on this deal"" she says. ""It's too important to be left to the politicians."" James ShawBBC Scotland reporter A
Scottish judge has rejected a case brought by anti-Brexit campaigners claiming
that the governmentâs deal to leave the EU is unlawful. The
campaigners had argued that the agreement breached the terms of legislation
designed to prevent Northern Ireland from being in a separate customs territory
to the rest of the UK. They had wanted the deal to be suspended. Lord
Pentland refused to grant an order suspending the deal. His reasons have not
yet been published. During
the hearing, he asked if a court order might prevent MPs debating the deal at a
special sitting on Saturday. A lawyer for the government read out a letter from
the speaker, warning that the court should not make an
order stopping debate of any matter before Parliament. A separate
action being brought by the same campaigners seeks to enforce the Benn Act
which is designed to prevent a no-deal Brexit. That is expected to be heard on
Monday if MPs sitting on Saturday reject the prime ministerâs deal.  Boris Johnson also repeated his commitment to leave the EU on 31 October. The prime minister said: ""I think we should leave the European Union on October 31st... Let me say we will leave the European Union on October 31st."" And talking about the deal he struck to resolve the issues over the Irish border, he denied breaking a promise to the Democratic Unionist Party. He said: ""No I donât accept that at all.  I think that what you have is a fantastic deal for all of the UK, and particularly for Northern Ireland because you've got a single customs territory. Northern Ireland leaves the EU with the rest of the UK."" The prime minister told the BBC he wanted the country to move on from Brexit which he described as ""divisive"". He said he was hopeful it would pass in the Commons on Saturday. Mr Johnson said: ""I very much hope so. Look, you know, this has been a long exhausting and quite divisive business Brexit. ""I hope that people will think well, you know, what's the balance, what do our constituents really want? Do they want us to keep going with this argument, do they want more division and delay?"" Boris Johnson has suggested there is ""no better outcome"" than the Brexit deal he is putting forward. In an interview with the BBC, the prime minister said:

""There's no better outcome than the one I'm advocating tomorrow."" Urging MPs to come together and support the deal he secured in Brussels on Thursday, Mr Johnson said there was now a ""chance to move on"". He said: ""I just kind of invite everybody to imagine what it could be like tomorrow evening, if we have settled this, and we have respected the will of the people, because we will then have a chance to move on.""

In the film, they warn that Brexit risks undermining the Good Friday Agreement and peace in Northern Ireland, saying: âEither Northern Ireland and
its hard-won peace is sacrificed on the Brexit altar or we end up in the
bizarre situation where Northern Ireland stays in Europeâs trading system."" They call for a second referendum, saying of Saturday's Parliament vote: ""Whatever is the outcome, no deal or bad deal, it should not pass without the final say resting with the
people. âThese Brexiteers talk about
the will of the people.  But in 2016 our knowledge was necessarily
limited. Now, three years on, three years of mess, misery and mayhem, when our
knowledge is vastly expanded by experience, how can it be undemocratic to ask
the British people their final opinion?"" The party's Brexit spokesperson says it wants Conservatives to ""take a stand"" in Saturday's vote. Scotland's highest civil court has dismissed a legal bid to stop the UK government from passing its proposed EU withdrawal agreement. Campaigners had argued that the agreement breached the terms of legislation designed to prevent Northern Ireland from being in a separate customs territory to the rest of the UK. They had wanted the deal to be suspended. Judge Lord Pentland refused to grant an order suspending the deal - his reasons have not yet been published. Read the news storyhere. Former Chancellor Philip Hammond is asking the prime minister to pledge not to ""dupe"" MPs into a no-deal Brexit down the line if they back his deal tomorrow. Writing in the Times, Mr Hammond says he will back the Letwin amendment so that Boris Johnson has to ask for a Brexit extension even if his deal passes, to prevent Brexiteers voting against the deal at a later stage oncethe Benn Acthas expired.

"Sean Dixon, co-founder of Richard James, says the Savile Row tailor feels ""a bit like collateral damage"". He and the other bespoke tailoring firms who line the world-famous London street feel bruised because, from Friday, every suit they sell to the US faces a new export tax of 25%. They are on a list of products the US is targeting with tariffs in retaliation for the EU giving illegal subsidies to plane-maker Airbus. And it has left Savile Row reeling. ""I don't think anybody on the street was aware of [the tariff],"" says James Sleater, founder and director of Savile Row's newest tailor, Cad & the Dandy, whose clients include British rapper Stormzy and rugby player Mike Tindall. ""Conversations about Airbus and [US President Donald] Trump and Savile Row are not normally three words that go hand in hand,"" he says. Why a row over jets could raise the cost of whisky 'Special relationship' won't guarantee UK-US trade Q&A: What impact will US tariffs have on Scotch whisky? Brexit: What trade deals has the UK done so far? The street has had little time to prepare for the tariff, which almost doubles the tax on an exported suit from roughly 13% to 25%. On 2 October, the World Trade Organisation (WTO) gave the US permission to impose taxes on $7.5bn (Â£5.8bn) of goods it imports from the EU. Savile Row is famous for its bespoke suits It was the latest chapter in a long-running battle between Washington and Brussels over illegal subsidies given to planemakers Airbus and rival Boeing. That same day, the US published the list of EU products that would face the new taxes, including men's woollen suits made in the UK, as well as cashmere knitwear and Scotch whisky - and told businesses the tariffs would come into force on 18 October. The tariffs come at a crucial time for the UK, which is preparing to leave the EU and strike trade deals with other nations, including the US. International Trade Secretary Liz Truss says: ""Resorting to tit-for-tat tariffs is not in any country's best interests and we are in regular contact with the Trump administration, urging them to refrain from resorting to such measures. ""As well as causing temporary disruption to UK businesses, it would also hit American consumers in the pocket."" Kathryn Sargent, Savile Row's first female master tailor, is concerned that her clients in the US, who make up a third of her business, may not be aware of the new tax. She travels to cities such as New York, Chicago and Washington DC three times a year to visit customers, show them fabrics and do fittings for her suits, which start at about Â£5,500. Kathryn Sargent is Savile Row's first female master tailor ""It is a conversation that I'll be having with my clients when I'm over there, to sense what their reaction is and to see if it puts them off placing future orders,"" she says. North America is an important market for Savile Row, as well as the wider British luxury industry. Mr Sleater reckons that total sales of the street's goods into the US total some Â£40m. The US is also the second largest export market, behind Europe, for UK luxury products, according to Walpole, the trade body for the British luxury sector, and Frontier Economics. But it is not just the business connection between the two countries that is important to Savile Row's tailors. ""All the past US presidents have had garments made in Savile Row,"" says Ms Sargent. ""When you think of all the Hollywood greats like Fred Astaire and Cary Grant, there is a beautiful relationship between Savile Row and America, so this tariff really hits us hard."" She hopes that her US clients' ""love of British quality craftsmanship"" will overcome any concerns about the added cost of buying a Savile Row suit. Fred Astaire, seen here with Audrey Hepburn while filming Funny Face, was a fan of Savile Row suits Small bespoke tailoring firms like Ms Sargent's will not be able to absorb the cost of the tax. Mr Dixon says that Richard James, one of the few Savile Row tailors with a store in the US, says it will do its best to absorb the cost: ""But we think there will be a priceâ¦ we will have to pass some of this on to our customers."" Arguably, the type of people who have a bespoke suit made by a Savile Row tailor are not short of a pound or two. ""The customer base is fairly affluent,"" admits Mr Dixon, whose clients include actor Benedict Cumberbatch, footballer David Beckham and rapper P Diddy. ""Nevertheless, an increase is an increase and we pride ourselves on people getting value for money, especially for a Savile Row suit. ""The amount of man-hours that go into it, the incredible fabrics used and a suit that can last 20 years or 30 years and then to have a big part of that being paid in tax. I don't know how people are going to feel about that."" While Savile Row's tailors were shocked by the tariffs, Walpole was not. Helen Brocklebank, CEO of Walpole ""We're disappointed, of course,"" says Helen Brocklebank, Walpole's chief executive. ""But we're not surprised that suiting and textiles and fine fabrics came so heavily top of the list."" She says that UK luxury goods such as cashmere sweaters have often been targeted by the US in trade tussles. Cad & the Dandy dressed Mike Tindall for his marriage wedding to Zara Phillips, daughter of Princess Anne, in 2011 In 1999, when Bill Clinton was in the White House, Scottish cashmere sweaters faced sanctions following a WTO ruling in a row between the US and the UK about bananas. But Ms Brocklebank does not think this latest round of tariffs will have a major impact on sales of UK luxury goods. ""You have quite a weak pound at the moment and the number of US visitors coming to the UK to shop for these kinds of goods is at an all-time high, so I don't think that the impact is going to be enormous,"" she says. President Trump, who reportedly favours suits made by Italy's Brioni, described the WTO ruling at the beginning of October as a ""big win"" for the US. But his jubilation - and any pain felt by UK businesses - may be short-lived. Actor Benedict Cumberbatch wore a Richard James suit to Wimbledon this year Ms Brocklebank points out that next spring, the WTO will rule on Boeing, the US planemaker, which it found had benefited from tax breaks. The EU could then be given the green light to enforce its own tariffs on US goods. Mr Sleater says that while Cad & the Dandy was caught unaware by the new taxes, Savile Row should use the opportunity to elevate its brand, which has historically always been about understatement. He says that while Italy's suitmakers - who are not facing US tariffs - have actively promoted their industry, Savile Row has not. ""The key thing about this is to stomach the tariffs being placed on us and - I'm talking about the street here - we somehow need to find a way to make our clothes even more appealing. ""Never before has there been such a time when branding is really, really important.""

"Jo Maugham QC led the action at the Court of Session in Edinburgh Scotland's highest civil court has dismissed a legal bid to stop the UK government from passing its proposed EU withdrawal agreement. Anti-Brexit campaigners had argued the deal contravened legislation preventing Northern Ireland from forming part of a separate customs territory. However, Lord Pentland ruled the application was ""misconceived and unjustified"". Campaigner Jo Maugham QC said the case was now unlikely to proceed further. In hiswritten opinion,external, the judge described the petition ""of very doubtful competency"" and concluded the petitioner had at best a ""weak"" case. Lord Pentland issued his decision on Friday afternoon Mr Maugham had lodged the petition on Thursday in an attempt to stop Parliament from passing the EU withdrawal agreement. After the ruling was published hetweeted,external: ""That was a difficult decision to make. It is difficult to move quickly and accurately and, the court has found, I got that decision wrong. ""We will review the decision carefully but my instinct is that we are unlikely to proceed to a full hearing for reasons indicated above."" He launched the legal challenge after the prime minister and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker announced on Thursday that the two sides had come to an agreement on a Brexit withdrawal deal, ahead of a crucial EU summit in Brussels. EU leaders then approved the deal, and MPs are expected to vote on it on Saturday. Aidan O'Neill QC is representing Mr Maugham in the case Earlier Aidan O'Neill QC, acting for the petitioner, told the court that the proposed Brexit deal would mean a ""continuing regime of EU law applicable to Northern Ireland"" - contrary to Section 55 of the Taxation (Cross-Border Trade) Act 2018. He said this would breach the Act's terms by creating different customs rules in Northern Ireland to the rest of the UK, leaving the deal void and unsuitable to be put before Parliament. Mr O'Neill said: ""The agreement which was presented yesterday is void; is of no effect as a matter of law."" Prime Minister Boris Johnson and European Commission President Jean Claude Juncker leave their joint press conference on Thursday Government lawyers defended the deal and claimed the legal action was a ""direct and manifest interference with Parliament"". Gerry Moynihan QC, acting for the government, described the legal challenge as ""a gross intrusion into the separation of power."" He argued Northern Ireland would remain in the UK's customs territory because ""a substantial part"" of trade would still be with the UK.

"This video can not be played Watch clashes between Mexico's security forces and drug cartel members Heavy fighting broke out in northern Mexico on Thursday after security forces detained a son of the jailed drug kingpin JoaquÃ­n ""El Chapo"" GuzmÃ¡n. Fighting raged for hours after Ovidio GuzmÃ¡n LÃ³pez was found in what authorities said was a routine patrol in the city of CuliacÃ¡n. Armed men were seen firing on police with bodies strewn in the road. Police withdrew without Mr GuzmÃ¡n in their custody to avoid further violence, officials said. How Mexico's drug kingpin fell victim to his own legend El Chapo: Five things to know Shocking allegations in 'El Chapo' trial Mexico's security minister, Alfonso Durazo, told Reuters news agency that a patrol of National Guard militarised police came under intense fire from outside the house where they had located Mr GuzmÃ¡n, forcing them to retreat from the building for their own safety and ""to recover calm in the city"". A lawyer for the GuzmÃ¡n family told the Associated Press, ""Ovidio is alive and free."" Mexico's President AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador said he would hold a meeting of his security cabinet to discuss the incident. This video can not be played El Chapo trial: Five facts about Mexican drug lord JoaquÃ­n GuzmÃ¡n Mr LÃ³pez Obrador was elected on a platform of cracking down on Mexico's drug cartels, and has tasked a new security force, the National Guard, with fighting the dealers. Under El Chapo's leadership, the Sinaloa cartel was the biggest supplier of drugs to the US, officials say. With the kingpin now behind bars, the cartel is said to be partially controlled by Ovidio GuzmÃ¡n Lopez, who is accused of drug trafficking in the US and believed to be in his twenties. The state government said Mr GuzmÃ¡n was found in a house by a police patrol on a routine search. It said cartel members subsequently launched the huge attack in an attempt to seize him back from the authorities. Fighters also attacked security forces in other parts of CuliacÃ¡n. Witnesses described scenes of panic in the city, a stronghold for the Sinaloa cartel, as families with small children fled from gunfire. Trucks were set alight in the streets to block roads ""No one knows what is going on but everyone is afraid and they have told us to not come in to work tomorrow,"" Ricardo GonzÃ¡lez, a city resident, told AP. Footage on social media showed a pick-up truck with a machine gun mounted on the back, in scenes reminiscent of a war zone. Armed men were seen in several areas of CuliacÃ¡n on Thursday The Sinaloa state government told residents to remain calm and stay off the streets Other footage showed families scrambling to take cover under cars and in shops as gunfire roared. In one video, a girl asked her father: ""Why are they shooting bullets?"" A purported mugshot taken of Mr GuzmÃ¡n while he was detained by police was shared widely on social media.

Sinaloa state's head of security, Cristobal CastaÃ±eda, told the Televisa network that two people had been killed and 21 injured, according to preliminary information. Pictures showing what appeared to be dead bodies on the streets suggest the death toll could rise. Some police officers were wounded, local officials said, but would not provide further details. The authorities say they are working to restore order in the city Cars and jeeps have were also set on fire during the clashes As fighting brought the city to a standstill, the Sinaloa state government said an unknown number of inmates had escaped from the Aguaruto prison. It said it was ""working to restore calm and order"" and called on residents to ""remain calm, stay off the streets and be very attentive to official advisories on the evolving situation"". By Juan Carlos Perez Salazar, BBC Mundo The details of what happened in CuliacÃ¡n are still sketchy, but it seems that, for a while, Ovidio ""The Mouse"" GuzmÃ¡n was in the hands of police. What followed next, though a source of great embarrassment for the Mexican government, may not be surprising to those who know how powerful drug cartels are in parts of the country. CuliacÃ¡n, capital of the state of Sinaloa, is one of those areas. It has been linked with the production of drugs since at least the 1940s, and several of the biggest ""capos"" (drug lords) were born there. Despite the capture of El Chapo, its most well-known leader, the Sinaloa Cartel is still immensely powerful in the region. And for critics of Mexico's President, this lays bare the failure of his strategy against the drug cartels. Some even say he has no strategy at all. ""El Chapo"" (or ""Shorty"") ran the Sinaloa cartel across northern Mexico. This video can not be played Mexico's drug war: Has it turned the tide? Over time, it became one of the biggest traffickers of drugs to the US. He escaped a Mexican jail through a tunnel in 2015, but was later arrested. He was extradited to the United States in 2017. He was accused of having helped export hundreds of tonnes of cocaine into the US and of conspiring to manufacture and distribute heroin, methamphetamine and marijuana. Who is 'El Chapo' GuzmÃ¡n? Mexico's most-wanted: A guide to the drug cartels Shocking allegations in 'El Chapo' trial El Chapo, 62, was found guilty in New York of 10 charges, including drug trafficking and money laundering. GuzmÃ¡n has been married three times. Estimates of the number of off-spring, from wives and girlfriends, vary from eight to 15. Ovidio GuzmÃ¡n LÃ³pez, is thought to be one of four children born to the drug kingpin's second wife, Griselda Lopez Perez. More prominent are his older brothers by GuzmÃ¡n's first marriage to Maria Alejandrina Salazar Hernandez - Ivan Archivaldo Guzman Salazar  and Jesus Alfredo Guzman Salazar, both 36. Ivan Archivaldo has developed a reputation for an extravagant lifestyle and flaunting his wealth on social media. The jailing of ""El Chapo"" threw up the question of who should now lead the Sinaloa cartel. There are reports of infighting between some of the Guzman sons, known as ""los chapitos"", and the co-founder of the Sinaloa cartel, Ismael ""El Mayo"" Zambada. Zambada has been trying to oust the sons,VICE news reported in July,externalquoting sources in the mountains of Sinaloa state. Gunmen are said to have been defecting to work for Zambada. Jesus Alfredo is wanted in the US on allegations of drug-trafficking and is on the most-wanted list of US Drug Enforcement Administration. Ivan Archivaldo has also been charged by the US authorities.

"This video can not be played On the road with police trying to stop ""county lines"" drugs gangs Police have made a record number of arrests in a week-long push to tackle so-called county lines drug gangs. Officers arrested 743 people and seized drugs worth over Â£400,000, 12 guns and dozens of other weapons. The operation, by forces across England and Wales, resulted in the ""disruption"" of 49 ""deal lines"", police said. Senior officers say better co-ordination between police forces means they know more than they've ever done about the gangs and their activities. County lines drugs gangs use dedicated phone lines to send mass texts to customers and organise networks of couriers, often children and vulnerable adults, to move the drugs from cities to smaller towns. These phone lines are branded with a gang's name, allowing customers to place orders but the dealers, based in distant cities, remain anonymous to avoid getting caught. Liverpool to north Wales: Up close with a county line Drug crime mapped What is County Lines? Overall, 652 men and 91 women were arrested in the so-called National Week of Intensification which began on 7 October, the highest number in any week of co-ordinated police activity against county lines gangs. The push was led by teams dedicated to fighting organised drug dealing, backed up by uniformed officers expert in pursuing and stopping cars. The operation also made use of intelligence from theNational Crime Agency,externaland automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) cameras which are being used to spot dealers moving drugs from major cities to the location where they are being sold. Senior officers say in recent years the lines, and the use of young people to move the drugs, have become the predominant ""business model"" for drug dealing. ""We know more than we have ever known about the gangs and those people who get exploited as part of county lines activity,"" said Deputy Assistant Commissioner Duncan Ball, from the National Police Chiefs' Council. He said better intelligence was the result of police forces working more closely together. ""We're resolved to tackle the gang leaders and tackle them hard,"" he added. The BBC was given access to theWest Midlands Police Regional Organised Crime Unit,externalas it tried to stop gangs operating between Birmingham and Worcestershire. In Aston, Birmingham, covert officers were on the streets in large numbers looking for gang leaders and drugs couriers. Traffic patrols trained in high-speed pursuit techniques followed one car which crashed, breaching a gas main. The car breached a gas main Officers had to swiftly clear the street while trying to find the suspect. At least one county line is suspected to be moving drugs from Birmingham to the town of Droitwich in Worcestershire. The police believe this single line is making Â£4,000 a day. The West Midlands team followed the drugs to their destination and lay in wait for the dealers with the help of West Mercia Police. Eventually a car was picked up by an automatic number plate reading camera outside Birmingham, heading to the area. The suspects reportedly switched cars before police mounted a high-speed ""hard stop"" on a busy rural road and arrested them. West Midlands police carried out simultaneous raids on Friday 11 October in Tipton, Birmingham, targeting a county line linking Birmingham and Hereford. A knife and samurai sword were found in a flat. County lines gangs are a challenge for police because they cause significant harm to the young people caught up in their activities - many are groomed to carry drugs and go missing from home. Sgt Jen Edwards, who leads the relatively new West Midlands Police team, called the gangs ""heartless and cruel"". ""They do not see these children as vulnerable children, they see them as a commodity, and a way of using them to make them more money."" Sgt Jen Edwards called the gangs heartless and cruel Supt Rich Agar, who leads the West Midlands Police county lines operation. said: ""They don't get their hands dirty. ""They don't carry the drugs, they don't have the weapons used for enforcement. They use vulnerable adults and children. ""The people at the bottom get caught and go to prison."" Police are increasingly using co-ordinated operations to tackle the gangs. A knife found during one of the raids During the intensification week, senior officers compared notes on a daily basis to ensure intelligence was shared. The government has announced it will expand the newCounty Lines Co-ordination Centre,externalset up to provide oversight. Police and the Home Office are also considering whether new laws could target the way county lines gangs send mass text messages to their customers to advertise drugs.

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""They will want to vote for it on Saturday"" Boris Johnson is in a race against time to sell the Brexit deal he has struck with the EU to MPs ahead of a Commons vote on Saturday. The prime ministerinsists he is ""very confident""of getting the majority he needs to ""get Brexit done"" by his 31 October deadline. But the DUP and every opposition party plans to vote against his deal. That means he must persuade Labour rebels, ex-Tories and Brexiteers in his own party to get on board. A spokesman for Mr Johnson said he and and his team were spending the day on the phone to MPs from across the Commons to sell the deal. The PM is also holding a cabinet meeting in No 10. Saturday sitting of Parliament: What to expect The DUP's Brexit spokesman, Sammy Wilson, said his party would not only vote Mr Johnson down,but urge Conservative MPs to ""take a stand"" with them, setting the scene for a frantic day of arm-twisting on all sides at Westminster.

Labour has also attacked the deal after one Tory MP, John Baron, said the UK would be able to leave the EU ""on no-deal terms"" if trade talks failed come December 2020 - the so-called transition period. The party's chairman, Ian Lavery, said: ""The cat has been let out of the bag... [and] no one should be in any doubt that Johnson's deal is just seen an interim arrangement."" But Home Secretary Priti Patel urged colleagues to look at the deal as an opportunity to ""start a new chapter for our country"". The prime minister will make a statement to the Commons on Saturday, before another minister opens a debate on the deal. If he does not manage to get the numbers needed to win a vote, then he is expected to try again to trigger a general election. Latest as PM tries to get MPs behind deal Johnson still facing an almighty gamble What is in Boris Johnson's new Brexit deal? New Brexit deal: Your questions answered The law states that the PM must ask the EU for a three month extension to the Brexit deadline if he cannot get a deal through Parliament. The text of the letter he must send to Brussels is contained in the so-called Benn Act, passed last month by MPs determined to prevent a no-deal Brexit. Mr Johnson has said the UK will leave on 31 October with or without a deal - but he has also said he will abide by the law. But even if MPs vote for his deal on Saturday, he may still have to ask the EU for an extension. Former Conservative MP Oliver Letwin hastabled an amendmentthat would ensure the deadline is extended until the Brexit deal had passed each step in Parliament to become law. Sir Oliver, who is among the MPs seeking to prevent a no-deal Brexit, said he did not want to ""let the government off the hook"". By BBC Parliamentary Correspondent Mark D'Arcy Sir Oliver's amendment is a cunningly-crafted proposition which, crucially, could be voted for by MPs who want a deal, but don't trust this one, and don't trust the government. It rests on the idea that were Parliament to approve the deal for the purposes of the Benn Act now, there might then be a danger that the subsequent legislation to enact it might be, somehow, derailed, resulting in a no-deal exit on 31 October. With the Benn Act out of the way, they believe that some manoeuvre, some legislative judo move, by factions inside and outside the government, who favour a ""clean Brexit"" could leave no time for any effective counterâ¦ and Britain would be out, with no deal. This reflects the sheer level of distrust that has accumulated over several cycles of Brexit angst. Read Mark's full blog The SNP's Westminster leader Ian Blackford has also tabled an amendment, calling fora three month extension to Brexit to allow for an early general election. He told the BBC the deal gives Northern Ireland a ""competitive advantage"", but ""shafted"" Scotland. This video can not be played Will MPs support Boris Johnson's new Brexit deal? Meanwhile, cabinet ministers have been touring the TV and radio studios to sell the deal. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab told BBC Radio 4's Today programme it was ""an opportunity to get Brexit done, turn the page and move forward"". The new deal is largely the same as the one agreed by Theresa May last year - but it removes the controversial backstop clause, which critics say could have kept the UK tied indefinitely to EU customs rules. Northern Ireland would remain in the UK's customs union under the new agreement, but there would also be customs checks on some goods passing through en route to Ireland and the EU single market. The prime minister is expected to focus his attention on winning over three groups to support his deal: Tory Brexiteers who have not yet backed a deal and repeatedly voted against former PM Theresa May's withdrawal agreement Twenty-three former Tory MPs who now sit as independents, including21 Mr Johnson kicked out of the partylast month after they rebelled against him in a bid to prevent a no-deal Brexit And a group of Labour MPs who have expressed a desire to back a deal but are concerned about protection for workers and the environment This video can not be played DUP: PM 'too eager for deal at any cost' The DUP is unhappy with the changes, claiming they are not in the best interests of Northern Ireland. But the Northern Irish party can no longer rely on the automatic support of the the pro-Brexit European Research Group - formed of backbench Tory MPs. Vice-chairman of the group, Mark Francois, told reporters he ""still has some concerns about some of the specifics of the deal"", and was meeting the prime minister ""to put some questions directly to [him]."" But ERG member Andrew Bridgen told BBC Breakfast he believed the ""vast majority"" of the group ""will come to the conclusion that this deal is tolerable and we need to get Brexit across the line"". The ERG will hold a meeting on Saturday morning to advise a position to members to take in Parliament. What is in the new Brexit deal? DUP 'unable to vote' for PM's new Brexit deal Labour's shadow chancellor John McDonnell told the Today programme the deal was ""worse deal than Theresa May's"", adding: ""We can't vote for that or let it go through"". But while Labour's focus was on defeating the government's proposals, Mr McDonnell said discussions were ongoing about a further referendum - either on Mr Johnson's deal or a ""sensible deal"" negotiated by Labour. ""There are discussions taking place [about] when the right time to put an amendment down is,"" he said. ""There is a principle here to be established to let the people decide."" He also warned there would be ""consequences"" for MPs in his party who voted for Mr Johnson's deal. However, on Wednesday, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn played down the possibility of removing the party whip from any rebels. ""I believe in the power of persuasion rather than the power of threat,"" he said. Labour MP Ronnie Campbell, who is standing down at the next election, said ""at the moment"" he would vote to support the deal. But he told the BBC: ""I am getting a lot of pressure from the head lads of the Labour Party... to abstain."" This video can not be played Crunching the numbers as MPs prepare for key Brexit vote The winning post for votes in the House of Commons is 320 if everyone turns up - seven Sinn Fein MPs do not sit and the Speaker and three deputies do not vote. There are currently 287 voting Conservative MPs. The prime minister needs to limit any rebellion among them. Then, if the DUP will not support his deal, he will need the backing of 23 former Conservative MPs who are currently independents. Most will probably support the deal, but not all. That is still not quite enough, though, so the PM will also need the backing of some Labour MPs and ex-Labour independents. In March, when MPs voted on Theresa May's deal for the third time, five Labour MPs backed it, plus two ex-Labour independents. This time it is likely to be a bit higher than that because several MPs have said they would now back a deal. All this still leaves the vote very close. And it is possible some MPs could abstain, making it even harder to predict the outcome.
