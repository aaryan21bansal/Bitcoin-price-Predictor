"One of the Chagos Islands - Diego Garcia - is home to a US military base The UK should end its control of the Chagos Islands in the Indian Ocean ""as rapidly as possible"", the UN's highest court has said. Mauritius claims it was forced to give up the islands - now a British overseas territory - in 1965 in exchange for independence, which it gained in 1968. The International Court of Justice said the islands were not lawfully separated from the former colony of Mauritius. The UK Foreign Office said: ""This is an advisory opinion, not a judgment."" It added it would look ""carefully"" at the detail of the opinion, which is not legally binding. The UK has previously said it will hand the islands back to Mauritius when they are no longer required for defence purposes. Referencing that, the Foreign Office said: ""The defence facilities on the British Indian Ocean Territory help to protect people here in Britain and around the world from terrorist threats, organised crime and piracy."" UK 'threats' over Indian Ocean islands UK defeated in UN vote on Chagos Islands Judge Abdulqawi Ahmed Yusuf described the UK's administration of the Chagos Islands - located more than 2,000 miles off the east coast of Africa - as ""an unlawful act of continuing character"". He added the UK was ""under an obligation to bring an end to its administration of the Chagos Archipelago as rapidly as possible"". The UN General Assembly asked the court in February 2017 to offer its opinion in on whether the process had been concluded lawfully. It is half a century since the UK took control of the Chagos Islands from its then colony, Mauritius. The British government evicted the entire population, before inviting the US to build a military base on Diego Garcia, one of the larger atolls. Mauritius was in the middle of negotiating its independence from the UK at the time and has repeatedly condemned the deal. By BBC Hague correspondent  Anna Holligan A ""blockbuster"" of an opinion from the UN's highest court. The judges' assessment was damning. At the heart of it, the right of all people to self-determination as a basic human right, which the UK violated when dismembering its former colony. The detachment of the strategically valuable archipelago cannot have been said to be based on free and genuine expression of the will of the people concerned, when one side is under the authority of the other. As the ruling power, the responsibility lay with the UK to respect national unity and territory integrity of Mauritius as required under international law. Instead, it divided the territory - effectively using the process of decolonisation to create a new colony. As part of the advisory opinion the judges poignantly pointed out that all UN member states were under obligation to cooperate to complete the decolonisation of Mauritius. This includes, of course, the US, which operates a military base on the largest atoll of Diego Garcia. Some of those who were forced to leave their homes on the Chagos Islands in the late 1960s hoped they would be allowed to return - and not just on one of the rare visits authorised by the UK. Speaking to the BBC last year, Samynaden Rosemond, who left when he was 36, said: ""Back home was paradise."" He and his wife, Daryela, moved to the outskirts of the capital of Mauritius, Port Louis. Chagossians often complain that they are treated as second-class citizens in Mauritius, and they often gather to cook coconut and fish curry and to sing songs about the life they left behind. Mr Rosemond added: ""The British didn't give us a chance. They just said: 'Oh, this is not yours anymore.' ""If I die here my spirit will be everywhere - it wouldn't be happy. But if I die there I will be in peace."" By BBC foreign correspondent Yasine Mohabuth in Port Louis, Mauritius Several Chagossians gathered at the Chagos Refugee Group's centre to follow live the session of the International Court of Justice in The Hague. It was in an explosion of joy that the news was celebrated by both them and their descendants in Pointe aux Sables - a suburb of the Mauritian capital, Port Louis. The leader of the Chagos Refugees Group, Olivier Bancoult, said it was a historic day. ""I dedicate this victory to the entire Chagossian community that is scattered in several countries around the world,"" he said. ""It is a great victory as all the time we wanted to go gather on the graves of our families that we lost there [on the Chagos Archipelago]"". Mauritian Prime Minister Pravind Jugnauth said the UK had always emphasised respect for international laws and, as such, expected the country, with which Mauritius has excellent relations, to respect the judges' opinion.

"Emiliano Sala's body was found in the plane's wreckage The pilot of the plane that crashed with Cardiff City striker Emiliano Sala on board did not have a licence for commercial flights, investigators say. The Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) confirmed David Ibbotson held a private pilot's licence. Itsinterim report,externalsaid he could only fly passengers in the EU on a cost sharing basis, not for reward. Cardiff City said it had ""grave concerns"" and questions over the validity of the pilot's licence. Investigators have not yet been able to establish what arrangement Mr Ibbotson had with Sala, and the status of the 59-year-old's licence at the time of the crash on 21 January will form part of the AAIB's investigations. Who owned the plane Sala died in? Family's tribute after Sala plane death Deadline for Sala payment extended The wreckage was found in three parts on the seabed of the English Channel Sala was found in the wreckage of the Piper Malibu N264DB, which was found on the seabed 13 days after it vanished over the English Channel near Guernsey. He had completed his transfer to Premier League side Cardiff from French club Nantes just two days earlier - for a club record fee of Â£15m - and had returned to France to say goodbye to his former teammates. Mr Ibbotson has not yet been found and his family hope a fresh search for his body will begin this week after setting up an online fundraising campaign which has raised Â£250,000. The aircraft remains underwater off the coast of Guernsey after an attempt to recover it was hampered by bad weather. The Piper Malibu N264DB aircraft was taking Sala from Nantes to Cardiff As flying is an expensive pastime, cost sharing allows pilots to notch up their flying hours while sharing the cost of fuel, landing fees and other expenses with passengers. The AAIB report said the basis on which Sala was being carried on N264DB ""has not yet been established but, previously, the pilot had carried passengers on the basis of 'cost sharing'"". Cost sharing on private flights is allowed in the UK and the report said Mr Ibbotson, of Crowle, North Lincolnshire, had operated these type of flights before. However, the report added that because the aircraft was US-registered, it was subject to Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulations, which meant he could only make the flight legally if he was paying half the operating expenses. In addition, Mr Ibbotson needed a ""bona fide purpose"" for making the flight - also known in aviation as ""common purpose"" - and must dictate when the flight should leave, the report added. Emiliano Sala (left) was on board a plane being flown by pilot David Ibbotson It is understood the flight's departure was delayed to allow Sala to say goodbye to his Nantes teammates before he left. The report said that, on the basis of a cost-sharing flight, it ""must not be made for the purpose of merely transporting the passenger"". This is one area the AAIB said needed further investigation. The AAIB released this photograph of the wreckage of the Piper Malibu The AAIB said the plane was found in three parts on the seabed after a submersible with cameras was sent underwater. It was ""extensively damaged"" and the wreckage was held together by electrical and flying control cables, while the engine was disconnected from the cockpit area. The AAIB said it had been unable to establish how much flying Mr Ibbotson had done recently, as his pilot's licence and logbook had been lost. Investigators would normally look to establish how many hours a pilot had flown in the preceding 28 and 90 days before a crash. Mr Ibbotson had approximately 3,700 flying hours and held a private pilot's licence in the UK and US. Air accident investigators will continue to look at all ""operational, technical, organisational and human factors"" which might have contributed to the crash. One focus will be further analysis of the radar information to try and understand the final moments of the flight. Investigators will analyse video from the wreckage in a bid to determine how the aircraft entered the sea. An AAIB spokesman said: ""We have gathered evidence from radar, weather reports, video of the aircraft on the seabed and interviews with witnesses. ""Some operational aspects are yet to be determined, such as the validity of the pilot's licence and ratings. ""Our priority now is to go through the evidence, much of which is extensive and complex, so we can piece together what happened between the aircraft being lost from radar and it coming to rest on the sea bed. ""This will help us understand the potential causes of the accident."" A Cardiff City spokesman said: ""We welcome further investigation into the accident, which is required to determine precisely what happened, and to ensure changes are made so that this situation never happens again."" The remit of the AAIB, which is a branch of the Department for Transport, is to conduct safety investigations into the cause of aviation accidents without apportioning blame or liability.

"The risk of a no-deal Brexit is turning into a ""full-blown economic crisis"", the aerospace trade body has warned. ADS Group said it was now able to track ""the very real economic damage being caused"" by the continuing uncertainty over the UK's exit from the EU. Its warning comes as insurance trade body, the ABI, said a no-deal Brexit ""would be a be an unforgivable act of economic and social self-harm"". The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March, but no deal is yet in place. Prime Minister Theresa May is facinggrowing pressure to delay Brexit if no deal is agreed by then. ADS, the aerospace and defence trade group, represents some of the largest companies operating in the UK, including Airbus, Boeing and BAE Systems. Chief executive Paul Everitt said its members needed a ""firm transition period and negotiations on the UK's future relationship with the European Union commenced at the earliest opportunity"". His comments come amid growing anger among many business groups over the continuing uncertainty. What effect has Brexit had on the UK economy? UK economy âstallsâ over Brexit fears Huw Evans, director general of the Association of British Insurers, is expected to suggest at a dinner on Monday evening that ""as a last resort"" Brexit should be subject to a short delay if no deal is the only alternative. Mr Evans will say that any future arrangement with the EU that required the UK to comply with rules over which it had no say could be ""weaponised by those in the EU that want toâ¦ damage the UK"". On Sunday, Mrs May announced that MPs will be able to have a fresh vote on the Brexit deal by 12 March, prompting expressions of dismay by several business groups. CBI deputy director general Josh Hardie described it as ""the latest signal to businesses that no-deal is hurtling closer"". ""It must be averted. Every day without a deal means less investment and fewer jobs created,"" he said. British Chambers of Commerce director general Dr Adam Marshall said: ""Delaying the vote until just two weeks before the UK's planned departure from the EU raises serious concerns about the timeline of the parliamentary process, and whether there is sufficient window to reach an agreement and pass the necessary legislation to avoid a no-deal exit."" And the Institute of Directors' interim director general, Edwin Morgan, said: ""There is too much at stake to run down the clock and risk an accidental no-deal. We sincerely hope this is the last and final date change."" He added: ""Businesses have lost all faith in the political process and as those first in the firing line of no-deal, they deserve to know more.""

"Theresa May returned to the Commons on Tuesday to try to allay the fears of MPs concerned about a no-deal Brexit. To settle their nerves -and to prevent resignations- she promised MPs a vote on whether to leave the EU with or without a deal, and on whether to ask for an extension of Article 50. But this will not happen unless her deal is rejected, and that ""meaningful vote"" could comeas late as 12 March. So, for now, MPs will only have the chance to have their say on how they want the next steps to play out in a series of votes on Wednesday. Do your duty on Brexit, May tells MPs No-deal Brexit impact assessment published Brexit delay from May not all 'simples' BIf not 29 March, then when? The process starts with the government putting down a motion. It is a plain piece of text, asking the House to note the the prime ministers's statement and that discussions between the UK and the EU are ongoing. This then allows MPs to table amendments, putting forward their proposals on what they think should happen next. This time, a total of 12 amendments were tabled. Speaker John Bercow makes the final call on which amendments are put before the Commons, as he explains in a tweet below. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

He has selected five amendments for debate by MPs. So what are the proposals and who has put them forward? First up is an amendment tabled by Jeremy Corbyn, which again pushes for his party's proposals for Brexit. These include creating a permanent customs union with the EU, and a close relationship with its single market. However, if this deal fails to get the support of MPs, Labour has confirmed it will put forward or support an amendment in favour of a public vote ""in order to prevent a damaging Tory Brexit"" or no-deal outcome. The party proposes a further referendum would then be held between Mrs May's deal and remaining in the EU - if Mrs May's deal gets the backing of MPs in the meaningful vote she says will take place before 12 March. The SNP, led at Westminster by Ian Blackford, and Plaid Cymru work closely in and out of Parliament. They have tabled a joint amendment insisting the UK should not leave the EU in any circumstances without a deal ""regardless of any exit date"". This is significant because of concerns expressed by some MPs that, even if Brexit is pushed back beyond 29 March, the UK could end up leaving anyway in July without a deal. Tory MP Caroline Spelman and Labour MP Jack Dromey have already proposed one successful amendment, which they tabled last month, gaining the support of the Commons to avoid a no-deal Brexit. However, it does not lead to legislation, so the government would not be bound to stick to it. The pair, who sit in neighbouring constituencies in Birmingham, tabled two amendments but only the first was selected. This calls for MPs to be given time on 28 February to put in place a legislative process to ensure the prime minister's commitment to give MPs a vote on delaying Brexit is legally binding. But in a joint statement the MPs said they would ""seek assurances from ministers"" during Wednesday's debate to ""secure confirmation of the prime minister's commitments"". If they are reassured the opportunity for an extension to Article 50 will be forthcoming, they will not put their amendment to a vote. Conservative backbencher Alberto Costa's amendment seeks to protect the rights of UK citizens in the EU, and vice versa. The amendment does not ask for a new agreement. But it calls on the government to implement the part of the withdrawal agreement - the so-called ""divorce bill"" element of the deal - that includes citizens' rights at ""the earliest opportunity"" regardless of the outcome of negotiations. The amendment has attracted significant cross-party support, with Labour, the Lib Dems and the SNP all backing it. Leading Tory Brexiteers and Remainers, including Dominic Raab and Justine Greening, are also on side. All told, 141 MPs have signed it so far. Mr Costa resigned his job as aide to Scottish Secretary David Mundell, because of a convention that members of the government should not amend government motions. Allow Twitter content?

Labour's Yvette Cooper has tabled an amendment - with the support of Conservative MP Sir Oliver Letwin - to reiterate the statement made by the PM, giving MPs the chance to vote on it specifically. It states that if MPs vote to delay Brexit, the government should seek an extension from the EU and bring forward legislation to change, in law, the date of the UK's departure. It would not be binding in the same way as an Act of Parliament, but would nonetheless be an expression of the will of the House and that would be politically difficult for Mrs May to ignore. Tabled by the party's leader Sir Vince Cable, this calls on the government to set aside Â£7.5bn to help workers who lose their jobs due to ""Brexit uncertainty"", whether as a result of their firms re-locating out of the UK or downsizing their operations. Just over a week after they quit their parties to come together, the Independent Group have tabled their first motion. It calls on the government to set time in Parliament before 8 March to debate and decide what the necessary steps are to prepare for a public vote. For them, the ballot paper would have the options of whether to proceed with what is agreed by Parliament, or whether to remain in the EU. It has the backing of the SNP, Liberal Democrats and Plaid Cymru and a small number of Conservatives, including Dominic Grieve and Phillip Lee. This amendment, tabled by Conservative Brexiteer John Baron, backs the government's motion but adds the rider that ""an extension to Article 50 cannot take no deal off the table"". Its signatories include former minister Sir Mike Penning. This urges the government to rule out a no-deal exit on environmental grounds, arguing leaving without a formal agreement would be ""disastrous"" for wildlife, nature and the marine environment. It says existing environmental protections the UK enjoys through EU membership to be maintained and improved. Tabled by Green Party MP Caroline Lucas, it has cross-party support, with ex-Labour leader Ed Miliband and Plaid Cymru's Liz Saville Roberts among its supporters. This amendment would nominate 19 March - about a week after the prime minister's suggested votes - as the specific day MPs should have a debate and hold a vote on the form of the future relationship with the EU. This amendment, tabled by the SNP's Angus MacNeil, calling on the government to revoke Article 50, which would effectively bring the Brexit process to a halt. Former Conservative Chancellor Ken Clarke, a leading pro-European voice in his party, is backing it but it is unlikely to attract much other support on the Tory benches. This calls on the government to ""honour the will"" of the Scottish Parliament and Welsh Assembly - which have voted for Article 50 to be extended. It says Brexit should be delayed until the end of 2021. Commons debating next steps for Brexit How does another Brexit delay work?

"The acting winners: Rami Malek, Olivia Colman, Regina King and Mahershala Ali British actress Olivia Colman defied the odds to scoop an Oscar on a night when Green Book also sprang a surprise by winning the award for best film. Colman won best actress for her role in The Favourite and charmed viewers with a funny and tearful speech. Green Book won three trophies in total, including best picture, which had been expected to go to Netflix's Roma.

""I think about what it would have been like to tell little bubba Rami that one day this might happen to him, and I think his curly-haired little mind would have been blown,"" he said in his acceptance speech. ""That kid was struggling with his identity, trying to figure himself out, and to anyone struggling and trying to discover their voice - listen, we made a film about a gay man, an immigrant, who lived his life unapologetically himself.

It was later reported that Malek fell off the stage after the ceremony concluded and had to be helped into a seat by security staff. The 37-year-old was reportedly attended to by paramedics, though he made no reference to the incident later when he spoke to reporters backstage. Allow Twitter content?

"Elecia Dexter will take over the roles of editor and publisher of the Democrat-Reporter An African-American woman will replace the editor of an Alabama newspaper who came under fire last week after calling for mass lynchings of Democrats. Elecia Dexter, 46, will take over as the Democrat-Reporter's editor and publisher, ""moving the paper into a new direction"", the paper said on Thursday. Longtime editor Goodloe Sutton, who made the comments about raiding Washington DC, still owns the paper. Alabama lawmakers applauded Sutton's departure and replacement. ""The Democrat-Reporter has provided the community of West Alabama with quality news for over 140 years and you may have full confidence that Ms Dexter will continue in this tradition as well as moving the paper into a new direction,"" the newspaper said in a statement to US media. The announcement noted Dexter was entering her role ""at a pivotal"" and ""challenging"" time. US editor calls for KKK to lynch Democrats Why US right-wing groups are on the rise It added that the newspaper had always been devoted to ""integrity and excellence in journalism"" under the leadership of Sutton and his wife, Jean. However, there was no apology from Sutton for his 14 February ""Klan needs to ride again"" article. Goodloe Sutton had received nationwide praise for his journalism in the 1990s The Ku Klux Klan (KKK) is one of the oldest white supremacy groups in the US, formed just after the Civil War. The group was behind many of the lynchings, rapes and violent attacks on African Americans in the 1900s, and there are still some 5,000 to 8,000 members across the country,according to the Southern Poverty Law Center,external. Sutton had called for the KKK to raid gated communities in Washington DC in retaliation for Democrats proposing higher taxes, and later insisted he only wanted to hang ""socialist-communists"". The op-ed went viral last week, receiving nationwide condemnation, but it was not the first time Sutton published racist opinion pieces in his paper. In 2017, an anonymous editorial,externaldiscussing the topic of NFL players kneeling in protest of racism said: ""That's what black folks were taught to do two hundreds years ago, kneel before a white man...Let them kneel!"" KKK members gather for a cross burning in 1994 Alabama lawmakers who had called for Sutton to step down were pleased at Dexter's appointment to the position. Senator Doug Jones tweeted: ""Good riddance Goodloe."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"All smiles? As the clock ran down, speculation was rife about a Brexit delay Determined to appear positive, Jean-Claude Juncker's spokeswoman described the European Commission President's latest meeting with Theresa May as ""constructive"". He said ""good progress"" was made. That's the same Jean-Claude Juncker who just a few days ago complained of Brexit fatigue, and said no agreement on a revised Brexit deal was on the horizon. So what changed? In short, nothing. Not on the EU side, anyway. But as we know, the EU wants to avoid a no-deal Brexit. It wants a deal by 29 March so that it can move on with other EU business and towards new talks with the UK on a post Brexit trade deal. Hence the bouncier, sunnier words from the Juncker camp. Remember that, despite rising mistrust and frustration, EU leaders are on the same side as Theresa May in wanting to get the Withdrawal Agreement passed through parliament. But the chasm between Downing Street and Brussels remains deep when it comes to the backstop â the workaround to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland after Brexit. On the sidelines of the EU-League of Arab States summit this weekend, Mrs May has been busy reminding Europe's leaders that she needs a fixed end date to the backstop or a unilateral get-out mechanism for the UK, in order to persuade sceptical MPs that the UK won't get stuck indefinitely in a customs arrangement with the EU. She also wants the EU to commit to finding â or accepting â alternatives to the backstop, such as sophisticated border technology. Cue weary, grumpy EU leaders sighing behind their hands. They know the drill. They know the prime minister's script. They are not budging from theirs. EU leaders say they won't change the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement â which contains the backstop text, and which Theresa May and her cabinet signed off on in November. A fixed end date or unilateral get-out mechanism would definitely mean changes. What the EU is open to ""24/7"", as I'm constantly told, is agreeing a legally binding text of assurances about the backstop - as long as said text involves assurances only, no changes. Brussels is waiting to hear from the UK Attorney General, Geoffrey Cox, who is working on a document. But now that Theresa May has delayed a meaningful vote on the Brexit deal until anytime up until 12 March, EU leaders wonder when Mr Cox's text might actually materialise. MPs to have Brexit vote by 12 March Brexit: Talk of delay, but no conclusions Downing Street fears that as soon as pen has hit paper and exchanged hands, the document could be leaked and potentially savaged in the UK media before there's even a chance for EU leaders to approve or discuss it. For example, if the attorney general were to come up with an end date to the backstop that in reality wasn't one, say, a maximum five-year backstop after which time there would be an investigation and a process â then, in the words of one of my diplomatic contacts: ""The European Research Group and arch-Brexiteers aren't fools. They'll see the legal veil of words for what it is."" This video can not be played Rutte: 'Wake up and close the Brexit deal' EU leaders are acutely aware that the criteria they will find acceptable in the legally binding document may make it unacceptable to the Brexiteers - because it would not go ""far enough"" on the backstop. And Brussels has told Mrs May that the EU will not move on the Brexit deal until she can persuade them that she will have a solid majority of MPs behind her. European Council President Donald Tusk said on Monday it was ""absolutely clear"" that Mrs May did not have the parliamentary majority required to give that guarantee. Which takes us back to the possibility of the Brexit process going right down to the wire. EU diplomats and politicians have repeatedly described to me what they view as the prime minister's three-way blackmail gamble - where Labour and the EU are faced with a no-deal Brexit and Brexiteers with the possibility of no Brexit at all. ""All she needs is for one of us to blink,"" said one European politician, ""and then she has her deal. Probably."" ""But it's a high-risk strategy,"" he added, ""as businesses and civilians are beginning to very much sense."" This video can not be played What happens in the event of no deal? And would the EU blink, in the end, if 29 March were nigh with no deal in sight? Would leaders budge more than they've so far indicated?As I've written before, the answer is: no-one knows. Only the EU leaders in the room at their summit on 21 March can decide. Maybe they'll hold an emergency Brexit summit even later in March. Nothing at the moment is clear. ""If we're really at that stage by then, with no confirmed extension of this process in sight, then a fixed end date of 2025 might be possible,"" said a well-placed European source. ""After all, if we don't manage to get a trade deal sorted with the UK in all the years in between, then the backstop will hardly be our only concern.""

"Theresa May returned to the Commons on Tuesday to try to allay the fears of MPs concerned about a no-deal Brexit. To settle their nerves -and to prevent resignations- she promised MPs a vote on whether to leave the EU with or without a deal, and on whether to ask for an extension of Article 50. But this will not happen unless her deal is rejected, and that ""meaningful vote"" could comeas late as 12 March. So, for now, MPs will only have the chance to have their say on how they want the next steps to play out in a series of votes on Wednesday. Do your duty on Brexit, May tells MPs No-deal Brexit impact assessment published Brexit delay from May not all 'simples' BIf not 29 March, then when? The process starts with the government putting down a motion. It is a plain piece of text, asking the House to note the the prime ministers's statement and that discussions between the UK and the EU are ongoing. This then allows MPs to table amendments, putting forward their proposals on what they think should happen next. This time, a total of 12 amendments were tabled. Speaker John Bercow makes the final call on which amendments are put before the Commons, as he explains in a tweet below. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

He has selected five amendments for debate by MPs. So what are the proposals and who has put them forward? First up is an amendment tabled by Jeremy Corbyn, which again pushes for his party's proposals for Brexit. These include creating a permanent customs union with the EU, and a close relationship with its single market. However, if this deal fails to get the support of MPs, Labour has confirmed it will put forward or support an amendment in favour of a public vote ""in order to prevent a damaging Tory Brexit"" or no-deal outcome. The party proposes a further referendum would then be held between Mrs May's deal and remaining in the EU - if Mrs May's deal gets the backing of MPs in the meaningful vote she says will take place before 12 March. The SNP, led at Westminster by Ian Blackford, and Plaid Cymru work closely in and out of Parliament. They have tabled a joint amendment insisting the UK should not leave the EU in any circumstances without a deal ""regardless of any exit date"". This is significant because of concerns expressed by some MPs that, even if Brexit is pushed back beyond 29 March, the UK could end up leaving anyway in July without a deal. Tory MP Caroline Spelman and Labour MP Jack Dromey have already proposed one successful amendment, which they tabled last month, gaining the support of the Commons to avoid a no-deal Brexit. However, it does not lead to legislation, so the government would not be bound to stick to it. The pair, who sit in neighbouring constituencies in Birmingham, tabled two amendments but only the first was selected. This calls for MPs to be given time on 28 February to put in place a legislative process to ensure the prime minister's commitment to give MPs a vote on delaying Brexit is legally binding. But in a joint statement the MPs said they would ""seek assurances from ministers"" during Wednesday's debate to ""secure confirmation of the prime minister's commitments"". If they are reassured the opportunity for an extension to Article 50 will be forthcoming, they will not put their amendment to a vote. Conservative backbencher Alberto Costa's amendment seeks to protect the rights of UK citizens in the EU, and vice versa. The amendment does not ask for a new agreement. But it calls on the government to implement the part of the withdrawal agreement - the so-called ""divorce bill"" element of the deal - that includes citizens' rights at ""the earliest opportunity"" regardless of the outcome of negotiations. The amendment has attracted significant cross-party support, with Labour, the Lib Dems and the SNP all backing it. Leading Tory Brexiteers and Remainers, including Dominic Raab and Justine Greening, are also on side. All told, 141 MPs have signed it so far. Mr Costa resigned his job as aide to Scottish Secretary David Mundell, because of a convention that members of the government should not amend government motions. Allow Twitter content?

Labour's Yvette Cooper has tabled an amendment - with the support of Conservative MP Sir Oliver Letwin - to reiterate the statement made by the PM, giving MPs the chance to vote on it specifically. It states that if MPs vote to delay Brexit, the government should seek an extension from the EU and bring forward legislation to change, in law, the date of the UK's departure. It would not be binding in the same way as an Act of Parliament, but would nonetheless be an expression of the will of the House and that would be politically difficult for Mrs May to ignore. Tabled by the party's leader Sir Vince Cable, this calls on the government to set aside Â£7.5bn to help workers who lose their jobs due to ""Brexit uncertainty"", whether as a result of their firms re-locating out of the UK or downsizing their operations. Just over a week after they quit their parties to come together, the Independent Group have tabled their first motion. It calls on the government to set time in Parliament before 8 March to debate and decide what the necessary steps are to prepare for a public vote. For them, the ballot paper would have the options of whether to proceed with what is agreed by Parliament, or whether to remain in the EU. It has the backing of the SNP, Liberal Democrats and Plaid Cymru and a small number of Conservatives, including Dominic Grieve and Phillip Lee. This amendment, tabled by Conservative Brexiteer John Baron, backs the government's motion but adds the rider that ""an extension to Article 50 cannot take no deal off the table"". Its signatories include former minister Sir Mike Penning. This urges the government to rule out a no-deal exit on environmental grounds, arguing leaving without a formal agreement would be ""disastrous"" for wildlife, nature and the marine environment. It says existing environmental protections the UK enjoys through EU membership to be maintained and improved. Tabled by Green Party MP Caroline Lucas, it has cross-party support, with ex-Labour leader Ed Miliband and Plaid Cymru's Liz Saville Roberts among its supporters. This amendment would nominate 19 March - about a week after the prime minister's suggested votes - as the specific day MPs should have a debate and hold a vote on the form of the future relationship with the EU. This amendment, tabled by the SNP's Angus MacNeil, calling on the government to revoke Article 50, which would effectively bring the Brexit process to a halt. Former Conservative Chancellor Ken Clarke, a leading pro-European voice in his party, is backing it but it is unlikely to attract much other support on the Tory benches. This calls on the government to ""honour the will"" of the Scottish Parliament and Welsh Assembly - which have voted for Article 50 to be extended. It says Brexit should be delayed until the end of 2021. Commons debating next steps for Brexit How does another Brexit delay work?

"Baroness Karren Brady has resigned from Sir Philip Green's retail empire, just weeks after vowing to stay in her post despite a harassment scandal. Taveta, the holding company for Sir Philip's Arcadia group, said she had stepped down as its non-executive chairman, but gave no reason. She had been chairman since July 2017. It comes after allegations of sexual harassment and racial abuse of staff by Sir Philipwere reported earlier this month, accusations he strongly denies. Lady Brady had said she felt ""a real sense of duty"" to staff at the retail empire, including her own daughter, Sophia Peschisolido, who has been a social media content assistant at Topshop since 2016. Karren Brady: 'The First Lady of Football' Sir Philip Green drops Telegraph injunction From 'king of the High Street' to 'unacceptable face of capitalism' She was made a life peer in 2014 and sits on the Conservative benches in the House of Lords. Lady Brady also runs a business leadership firm through the website strongfemaleleadership.com. The firm said Sharon Brown had also resigned as non-executive director of Taveta. ""Taveta thanks them for their contribution and wishes them well for the future,"" the company said. Simon Jack, business editor Baroness Brady's seat at the head of the Taveta board has been an uncomfortable one ever since she became chair in 2017. Putting one of Britain's most high-profile businesswomen at the head of a board on which she had served since 2010 was seen a shrewd appointment in the wake of the collapse of BHS. She has described herself as being ""tough"" and has regularly spoken out against men who abuse their power within organisations, subjecting women to inappropriate behaviour. The recent revelations of substantial payments of hush money to keep allegations against Sir Philip of sexual and racial harassment quiet therefore made her position very awkward indeed. Having weathered the media storm around Sir Philip Green's conduct and the use of non-disclosure agreements for several months, questions will naturally arise as to why they are both stepping down now. Sir Philip Green has always insisted that there was nothing in his conduct that was unlawful. With both business associates and board members jumping ship, it seems that while not unlawful, it has made him deeply unpopular. Earlier this month, Sir Philip dropped legal action against the Daily Telegraph newspaper, which had been prevented from publishing accounts of his alleged misconduct towards five employees. The paper subsequently reported that he paid a female employee more than Â£1m to keep quiet after she accused him of kissing and groping her. After the allegations became public, Lady Brady came under pressure to step down from her post at Taveta. But she responded by saying that she would stay in her post because she felt ""a real sense of duty"" to the people working at Taveta. Karren Brady with her daughter, Sophia Peschisolido She said at the time in a statement issued through her public relations team: ""I want to be 100% clear - I have always been an outspoken defender of women's rights in the workplace and always will be. ""As chairman of Taveta, I am extremely proud of our people, our customers and our brands. My primary concern are the 20,000 people who work there, of which over 85% are women.""

"This video can not be played Theresa May says all her energy is focused on leaving with a deal on 29 March Theresa May says she remains ""focused"" on leaving the EU on 29 March, despite calls from her own party for a delay. The PM said she had felt a ""real determination"" from EU leaders in recent days to find a ""smooth and orderly way [to leave] with a deal"". But Dutch PM Mark Rutte warned her the UK was ""sleepwalking into a no-deal scenario"" and needed to ""wake up"". Mrs May admitted there was ""still more to do"" before Parliament could vote on her final plan. The UK will leave the EU on 29 March, whether it has agreed a deal or not. The only way to change that is to revokeArticle 50, or to request a delay from the EU - which the bloc would have to approve. Pressure on PM to consider Brexit delay What does 12 March Brexit vote date tell us? Ireland 'not playing chicken' on backstop Some Conservative colleagues have suggested she should consider delaying Brexit to avoid leaving without a deal. The BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg understands No 10 is considering ways to give ""more assurances"" to MPs and ministers concerned about leaving the EU without a deal. But at a press conference in Sharm-el-Sheikh, the prime minister was defiant about pushing forward with the scheduled date. ""A delay in this process doesn't deliver a decision in Parliament [and] it doesn't deliver a deal,"" she said. ""What it does is precisely what the word delay says, it just delays the point in which we come to that decision."" What is Theresa May really willing to do if her deal falls in Parliament? Increasing numbers of EU leaders and her own government ministers believe that she should acknowledge that she might have to delay the UK's departure from the EU if her agreement is rejected by MPs again next month. The President of the EU Council, Donald Tusk, says it's ""rational"" to consider. Extending the process was discussed by Theresa May and Angela Merkel over breakfast this morning - but not with any conclusion. And the prime minister, herself, will do almost anything to avoid answering the question. Read more from Laura here. On Sunday, the prime minister told MPs they would get their chance to have a final ""meaningful vote"" on her deal by 12 March - only 17 days ahead of Brexit - causing criticism from opposition MPs, fellow Tories and business leaders. But MPs will get to put forward their own proposals on Wednesday,when the government tables an amendable motion on which they can vote. Mrs May has been at the EU-League of Arab States summit in Egypt for two days and held a number of meetings with EU leaders on the fringes as she presses for more concessions to her deal. The major sticking point is the backstop - the policy to prevent a hard border returning to the island of Ireland. Parliament voted for her to return to Brussels to seek ""alternative arrangements"" to replace it, as critics feared it would keep the UK locked into EU rules indefinitely. Her team has been discussing proposals with EU officials, including introducing a time limit to the policy or creating a get-out clause for the UK. But the EU has repeatedly refused to reopen the withdrawal agreement - the so-called ""divorce bill"" element of the deal that includes the backstop. Mrs May said: ""There is still more work to do, and my team will be in Brussels [on Tuesday] working on the legally binding assurances that the UK Parliament needs in relation to the backstop. ""But what I have sensed in all of my conversations with my fellow leaders, both here in Sharm-el-Sheikh and in recent days, is a real determination to find a way through which allows the UK to leave the EU in a smooth and orderly way with a deal."" Germany's Angela Merkel described her meeting with Mrs May as ""good"" and ""friendly"", while European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said his talks with the PM had been ""constructive"". However, Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar described a no-deal Brexit as a ""lose-lose-lose scenario for everyone"", althoughhe told reporters ahead of a meeting with Mrs May that he thought the outcome was unlikely. And Mr Rutte told the BBC: ""It's four weeks until the end date and still the UK has not agreed a position. So now we are sleepwalking into a no-deal scenario. ""It's unacceptable and your best friends have to warn you. Wake up. This is real. Come to a conclusion and close the deal."" This video can not be played Rutte: 'Wake up and close the Brexit deal' President of the European Council, Donald Tusk, said it was ""absolutely clear"" to him that there was no majority in the House of Commons to approve any deal, adding: ""We will face an alternative, chaotic Brexit or an extension."" He said he discussed a ""potential extension"" to Article 50 with Mrs May, saying it was an ""objective fact"" that became more likely as 29 March approached, and would be a ""rational solution"". But he said that Mrs May told him ""she still believes she is able to avoid this scenario"". The prime minister has long resisted any suggestion that the UK's departure could be postponed beyond 29 March. But BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg says two cabinet ministers have told the BBC they believe she will this week grant some kind of concession to allow for a possible delay. Monday:The PM meets with EU leaders, including Mrs Merkel and Mr Junker, on the fringes of the EU-League of Arab States summit. Tuesday:Mrs May gives a statement to the House of Commons updating them on her progress on Brexit. Members of her negotiating team will return to Brussels to continue talks with the EU. Wednesday:MPs debate an amendable motion tabled by the government. Speaker John Bercow chooses which amendments to put forward, and MPs vote on the next step proposals.

"Labour has said it is prepared to back another EU referendum to prevent a ""damaging Tory Brexit"". Jeremy Corbyn has told Labour MPs the party will move to back another vote if their own proposed Brexit deal is rejected on Wednesday. Labour's Emily Thornberry said if the parliamentary process ended with a choice of no deal or the PM's deal, the public should decide. Theresa May is under growing pressure to delay the 29 March Brexit date. Labour have not yet made clear what their proposed referendum would be on, but a party briefing paper to MPs says that any referendum would need to have ""a credible Leave option and Remain"". The prime minister, who will update MPs on the negotiations on Tuesday, has insisted the UK can still leave next month as planned. The UK voted to leave the EU in a referendum in June 2016, but the withdrawal deal Mrs May negotiated with the EU has to be agreed by MPs - and it suffered a huge defeat by them last month. Mrs May has ruled out a ""meaningful vote"" on her Brexit deal this week - saying one would be held by 12 March - but she will give MPs the chance to have their say on how the next steps for Brexit. MPs will be able to table amendments to a government motion, putting forward their proposals on what they think should happen next. Theresa May 'focused' on leaving on time, despite calls for delay Which amendments will be tabled this week? EU sticks to Brexit script in final sprint Mr Corbyn has told his MPs that Mrs May is ""recklessly running down the clock"" in an attempt to ""force MPs to choose between her botched deal and a disastrous no deal"". He said Labour would also put down an amendment this week setting out its plan for a ""comprehensive customs union"" and ""close alignment"" with the single market. The amendment also sets out guarantees on rights and standards, protection for Britain's role in EU agencies and a security agreement which guarantees access to the European arrest warrant and ""vital"" shared databases, he said. The Labour leadership has moved to this position believing that, as things stand, a plan to hold another referendum would not get the votes it needs in Parliament. Right now, they reckon it's a promise they can make, but will probably never have to keep. But if, as this political moment implies, there is a total meltdown, the prime minister's deal falls and chaos beckons, the move tonight keeps Labour's options firmly open, and has a better shout at keeping anxious Labour Europhiles happy. In such volatile times it is, of course, not impossible that a majority for another vote could emerge. But there is already some angst over the move. Read more from Laura Labour has also said the party will support a cross-party amendment, proposed by Labour's Yvette Cooper and Tory MP Sir Oliver Letwin, designed to rule out the prospect of a no-deal exit. Mr Corbyn said: ""One way or another, we will do everything in our power to prevent no deal and oppose a damaging Tory Brexit based on Theresa May's overwhelmingly rejected deal. ""That's why, in line with our conference policy, we are committed to also putting forward or supporting an amendment in favour of a public vote to prevent a damaging Tory Brexit being forced on the country."" This video can not be played The BBC's Jonathan Blake explains the impact Jeremy Corbyn's move could have At their conference last autumn, Labour members backed a policy of keeping all options on the table, including holding another referendum, if it could not force a general election. However, many Labour MPs believe the party has been slowly distancing itself from that commitment after it failed to win a vote of no confidence against the government last month. This video can not be played Emily Thornberry: 'We need the people to break Brexit log jam' Nine Labour MPs have quit the party in the past week, partly in protest at its stance on Brexit. Shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer insisted the party would ""deliver"" on its promises. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Ms Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, told the BBC: ""What she [Theresa May] wants to do is just get herself into a position whereby she says it's my deal or no deal. ""We think both of those are disastrous, and so we will see what it is at the end of the parliamentary process - whether we are facing no deal or a disastrous Tory Brexit. ""But either should go before the people and we need to have the people to break the logjam."" Labour MP David Lammy, who backs a ""People's Vote"" on the terms of the UK's exit, welcomed the move by his party to ""back the principle"" of a referendum. ""Even if MPs can agree some sort of deal, it would be wrong to force it on the British people when we now know so many of the promises made in 2016 have been broken, and any deal will be worse than the one we've already got inside the EU,"" he said.

But if the deal was rejected, he said, it would ""open up"" a range of other possibilities, one of which would be to put the final decision ""in the people's hands"". Shadow education secretary Angela Rayner tweeted that if the prime minister did not support Labour's amendment, then ""the time has come"" to stop a no deal scenario with a public vote.

Before too long, though, Parliament may make her respond. Even if Theresa May offers worried former Remainers a concession this week, risking the wrath of Brexiteers, a delay would not necessarily be easily accepted by the European Union. Mark Rutte, the Dutch prime minister, told me the UK would have to ask for an extension and explain what it's for - the EU could not, he warned, just spend another couple of months going round in circles. Downing Street privately believes they are making genuine progress towards an extra assurance on the controversial Irish backstop, that would make the deal more palatable to Tory backbenchers - hoping that could mean they never have to make the choice of delay, or no deal. But with time so short now - even if the deal is approved by MPs next month - another few weeks may still be needed to pass all the new laws that are required.

"The risk of a no-deal Brexit is turning into a ""full-blown economic crisis"", the aerospace trade body has warned. ADS Group said it was now able to track ""the very real economic damage being caused"" by the continuing uncertainty over the UK's exit from the EU. Its warning comes as insurance trade body, the ABI, said a no-deal Brexit ""would be a be an unforgivable act of economic and social self-harm"". The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March, but no deal is yet in place. Prime Minister Theresa May is facinggrowing pressure to delay Brexit if no deal is agreed by then. ADS, the aerospace and defence trade group, represents some of the largest companies operating in the UK, including Airbus, Boeing and BAE Systems. Chief executive Paul Everitt said its members needed a ""firm transition period and negotiations on the UK's future relationship with the European Union commenced at the earliest opportunity"". His comments come amid growing anger among many business groups over the continuing uncertainty. What effect has Brexit had on the UK economy? UK economy âstallsâ over Brexit fears Huw Evans, director general of the Association of British Insurers, is expected to suggest at a dinner on Monday evening that ""as a last resort"" Brexit should be subject to a short delay if no deal is the only alternative. Mr Evans will say that any future arrangement with the EU that required the UK to comply with rules over which it had no say could be ""weaponised by those in the EU that want toâ¦ damage the UK"". On Sunday, Mrs May announced that MPs will be able to have a fresh vote on the Brexit deal by 12 March, prompting expressions of dismay by several business groups. CBI deputy director general Josh Hardie described it as ""the latest signal to businesses that no-deal is hurtling closer"". ""It must be averted. Every day without a deal means less investment and fewer jobs created,"" he said. British Chambers of Commerce director general Dr Adam Marshall said: ""Delaying the vote until just two weeks before the UK's planned departure from the EU raises serious concerns about the timeline of the parliamentary process, and whether there is sufficient window to reach an agreement and pass the necessary legislation to avoid a no-deal exit."" And the Institute of Directors' interim director general, Edwin Morgan, said: ""There is too much at stake to run down the clock and risk an accidental no-deal. We sincerely hope this is the last and final date change."" He added: ""Businesses have lost all faith in the political process and as those first in the firing line of no-deal, they deserve to know more.""

"A Lebanese supporter carries a Hezbollah flag in Beirut The UK Parliament is set to pass new rules classifying Hezbollah as a terrorist group. Parts of the Lebanese organisation have been proscribed since 2001, with its military wing banned since 2008. UK authorities say they are no longer able to distinguish between the group's military and political wings. The changes are expected to take force from Friday, after which supporting Hezbollah will be an offence carrying a sentence of up to 10 years in prison. Hezbollah - translated as the Party of God - is a Shia Islamist political, military and social organisation that wields considerable power in Lebanon. Profile: Lebanon's Hezbollah Home Secretary Sajid Javid said he had decided to proscribe the group in its entirety because Hezbollah was ""continuing in its attempts to destabilise the fragile situation in the Middle East"". The group, which is backed by Iran, has sent thousands of its fighters to Syria to support forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad in battles against predominantly Sunni Muslim rebel forces and the jihadist Islamic State group. Last month,Hezbollah was awarded three cabinet posts in the newly-formed Lebanese cabinetafter it made gains, alongside its allies, in the 2018 parliamentary elections. Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt echoed Mr Javid's comments, adding that the government could not be complacent about terrorism. ""It is clear the distinction between Hezbollah's military and political wings does not exist, and by proscribing Hezbollah in all its forms, the government is sending a clear signal that its destabilising activities in the region are totally unacceptable and detrimental to the UK's national security,"" he said. Mr Javid's Israeli counterpart Gilad Erdan welcomed the decision on Twitter and called on the EU to follow suit. Hezbollah was formed as a resistance movement during the Israeli occupation of southern Lebanon in the early 1980s. The militant group's capture of two Israeli soldiers in a cross-border attack led to a month-long war with Israel in 2006. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

In addition to Hezbollah, the draft order also proscribes Ansaroul Islam and Jamaat Nusrat al-Islam Wal-Muslimin (JNIM) as terrorist organisations. Ansaroul Islam and JNIM are militant Islamist groups active in West Africa - both have claimed responsibility for attacks in the region. The order - which is expected to be approved by Parliament - will become active from Friday and will put Britain in line with other countries including the US. UK ban for Hezbollah political wing?

"Dwayne Johnson sent a message to Rosie telling her to ""stay strong"" The father of a girl with Down's syndrome said it was ""really cool"" for actor Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson to send her a message on Twitter. The Hollywood star, who voiced Maui in the film Moana, told Rosie to ""stay strong"" after her father wrote that the film was one of her favourites. Jason Kneen, from near Ludgershall, in Wiltshire, originally posted a photograph of his daughter smiling. He said it was ""insane"" that the tweets had gone viral. Allow Twitter content?

"Julia Roberts presented the night's big prize - best picture Until the last couple of categories, everything was ticking along as expected at this year's Oscars. But the gasp of surprise at Olivia Colman beating Glenn Close to best actress was eclipsed only by an even bigger gasp of surprise a few minutes later, when Green Book beat Roma to best picture. Alfonso Cuaron's subtitled, two-and-a-half-hour long black and white film was largely expected to go home with the night's top award. It's possible it lost out because it was a Netflix movie - the Academy may have been reluctant to set the precedent of a streaming service winning the top prize in film. Snubs and surprises aside, here are a few things we learned from this year's Oscars. 1. We Will, We Will, Open The Show Since You Guys Don't Have A Host The ceremony got off to a strong start as singer Adam Lambert took to the stage with Brian May and Roger Taylor. They performed Queen's We Will Rock You and We Are The Champions as Emma Stone, Lady Gaga, Sam Rockwell and many more were seen rocking out in the audience. ""Welcome to the Oscars!"" shouted Lambert from the stage, a greeting normally reserved for the host. In the absence of one, it was the perfect way to win over the audience both at home and in the Dolby Theatre. It turned out to be especially fitting as Bohemian Rhapsody, the biopic of the band, ended up going home with four trophies - the most of any film on the night. 2. The guest presenters were a huge success Tina Fey and Amy Poehler were widely praised during their three years fronting the Golden Globes for adding some much needed sarcasm and cynicism to awards season, which can often feel pretentious and self-important. When Kevin Hart dropped out of hosting the Oscars in December, many suggested the pair would be a good choice to present instead. Clearly, the Academy was listening. Along with their Saturday Night Live co-star Maya Rudolph, Fey and Poehler were enlisted to present the first category of the night, effectively giving them the role of performing traditional opening monologue. Their jokes included: ""So just a quick update for everybody in case you're confused, there is no host tonight, there won't be a popular movie category, and Mexico isnotpaying for the wall."" ""Hey Chadwick Boseman, Wakanda plans haveyougot later?"" ""Roma's on Netflix? What next, my microwave makes a movie?"" ""Everybody look under your seats, you're all getting one of those cheese sandwiches from the Fyre festival!"" 3. Lady Gaga got deep about Shallow All eyes were on Lady Gaga as she took to the stage halfway through the ceremony, kindly bringing her co-star Bradley Cooper with her for a live performance of Shallow, their duet from A Star Is Born. With Cooper snubbed in the best director category and an outsider for best actor, this was a rare opportunity in the night for him to stretch his legs. Gaga was back on stage later in the evening to accept the Oscar for best song, alongside Mark Ronson, Anthony Rossomando and Andrew Wyatt. Speaking backstage, Gaga said: ""For this film, there were many songs written, but there was one song that was written with true, true friends of mine, who know everything about me, the ups and the downs."" Asked to expand on the struggles she's had to overcome on her journey to Oscar glory, Gaga replied: ""I was so determined to live my dreams, and yet there was so much in the way. ""There were so many things I did not anticipate, that broke me, that tortured me, that traumatised me. And I think sometimes that people think that it comes easy to us, that we show up, and we have our suits on, and it's all okay. ""But the truth is this is very, very hard work."" 4. Melissa McCarthy and Brian Tyree Hill went method Best actress nominee Melissa McCarthy and Atlanta actor Brian Tyree Hill took their hosting duties very seriously indeed. The pair delivered a hilariously dry performance while dressed in extremely flamboyant costumes - McCarthy's being a nod to The Favourite - to reflect the award they were about to give out for best costume design. They were almost as popular as the winner, Ruth E Carter, who became the first black woman to win the prize in Academy history, for Black Panther. ""[This win] means we've opened up the door,"" Carter said backstage. ""I've been struggling, digging deep, mentoring and doing whatever I could to raise others up, and I hope through my example this means there is hope and means other people can come on in and win an Oscar just like I did."" 5. Rami Malek acknowledged the criticism of Bohemian Rhapsody Backstage in the press room, best actor winner Rami Malek was quick to acknowledge the bad reviews Bohemian Rhapsody received. Before anyone had even asked a question, he said to journalists: ""I don't think, critically, the decision on this film was unanimous, but I do appreciate everything you guys had to write. As a kid, I read criticism of film and I learned a lot from it, so thank you."" If there was ever a way to immediately endear yourself to the press, this was it. 6. Organisers were strict about curbing the speeches At the Oscar nominees' luncheon last month, it was announced that speeches would be limited to 90 seconds, to stop the famously over-long ceremony getting even longer. The winners of make-up and hairstyling were an early casualty of this rule, which acted as a warning shot to other winners for the rest of the night. When the winning team behind Vice didn't leave the stage as the music started playing, the mics and spotlights were turned off - a not particularly subtle way to get them to stop talking. Clearly worried he might be curbed in the same way, BlackKklansman director Spike Lee opened his acceptance speech for best adapted screenplay by saying: ""Do not turn that clock on!"" The Academy was probably feeling more agreeable to his request, with Lee having just provided one of the night's viral moments, as he leapt into Samuel L Jackson's arms upon winning the prize. 7. Olivia Colman will be sleeping with her Oscar Olivia Colman was the unexpected winner of best actress, an award which had been widely expected to go to Glenn Close. ""This is hilarious, I've got an Oscar,"" Colman said through tears and genuine surprise, reflecting the reaction of the audience. ""I could not tell you what I'm feeling. I don't know what to do with myself at the moment,"" Colman added backstage. How much of her acceptance speech was prepared? ""None of it,"" replied Colman - an entirely believable answer, especially as it turned out she forgot to mention two of her fellow nominees. ""I've just been told I completely forgot Melissa [McCarthy] and Yalitza [Aparicio], but it's not an everyday occurrence, so I don't know how anyone is composed and remembers everything."" Asked where she will keep her Oscar, Colman replied: ""In bed with me. Between me and my husband. He doesn't know yet. He won't mind.""

"This video can not be played Spike Lee on why Green Book, which stars Mahershala Ali, was ""not my cup of tea"" Spike Lee did not do much to hide his displeasure when Green Book beat his film and six others to this year's best picture Oscar. According to one report,external, the BlacKkKlansman director tried to storm out of the Dolby Theatre when the winner was read out by Julia Roberts. ""I thought I was courtside at the [Madison Square] Garden and the ref made a bad call,"" Lee later told reporters, saying the film was ""not his cup of tea"". ""I'm snake-bit,"" he joked, using a euphemism for experiencing failure or bad luck. ""Every time somebody's driving somebody, I lose."" His comment was a reference to Driving Miss Daisy, winner of the best picture Oscar in 1990 and a film to which Green Book has been compared. Lee's film Do the Right Thing was nominated for two Oscars in 1990 - best original screenplay and best supporting actor - but missed out on both. Colman and Green Book win Oscars Oscars 2019: As it happened Oscars 2019: Winners in full In Green Book, an African-American classical pianist is driven around the American south of the 1960s by an Italian-American chauffeur. In Driving Miss Daisy, an elderly Southern matron grudgingly agrees to be chauffeured by an African-American driver. ""They changed the seating arrangement!"" said Lee of Green Book, which also won Oscars for its screenplay and for supporting actor Mahershala Ali. Black Panther star Chadwick Boseman also expressed disappointment as Green Book director Peter Farrelly and his predominantly white production team took to the stage. Allow Twitter content?

Justin Chang from the Los Angeles Times was particularly scathing of Green Book's triumph, calling it ""the worst best picture Oscar winner since Crash,external."" Crash, a multi-stranded drama about race relations in contemporary Los Angeles, was the widely reviled winner of the best picture award in 2006. ""Green Book is about as traditional a choice as you can get,"" wrote The Independent's Clarisse Loughrey, describing its win as ""a case of the same old, same old,external"". The film, which was released in the UK earlier this month, takes its title from a guidebook African-American travellers once used to negotiate the United States. Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali as Tony Vallelonga and Don Shirley So what is it about Farrelly's film that has rubbed so many the wrong way? For many, it's the idea that the film perpetuates the ""white saviour"" trope that can be found in so many Hollywood films about bigotry and intolerance. Ali's character, real-life musician Don Shirley, is pivotal to the story. Yet its real protagonist is Viggo Mortensen's Tony ""The Lip"" Vallelonga, a bouncer-cum-bodyguard whose friendship with Shirley makes him wise up to his own racial prejudices. According to Vox's criticTodd VanDerWerff,external, the film ""lets white folks off the hook for whatever responsibility we bear for the crushing weight of systemic racism"". The film has also been criticised for its use of a so-called""magical negro"" figure,externalwhose sole function is to facilitate positive change in a white character. Green Book won the People's Choice award at last year's Toronto Film Festival - an award seen by many as a reliable indicator of Oscar glory. Yet the film would soon run into a number of public relations potholes that made last night's win seem like a remote possibility. First came Mortensen's use of 'the N-word' in a post-screening Q&A session, an incident for which he issueda fulsome apology,external. Then came criticism from members of Shirley's family, who dismissed the film as ""a symphony of lies,external"" that exaggerated Vallelonga's relationship with his employer. Nick Vallelonga with two of Green Book's Oscars In January, Farrelly issued his own apology forexposing his penisto colleagues in the late 1990s, saying he had been ""an idiot"" and that he was now ""deeply sorry"". More contrition followedfrom Vallelonga's son Nick, one of Green Book's writers, over a 2015 tweet in which he claimed he had seen Muslims in New Jersey celebrating the 9/11 attacks. Controversy dogged Green Book all the way to the Oscar ceremony itself, with some questioning whether it was right to have veteran congressmanJohn Lewis present its best picture citation,external. The US author and journalistRaquel Cepeda,externalwrote that President Donald Trump ""would have been a better peddler of Green Book's saccharine propaganda"". Yet it would be wrong to say the film is entirely without friends. ""I don't care about what they say, Green Book is a such a fantastic movie and deserved that freaking Oscar!""tweeted,externalone defiant fan on Monday.

"The Academy Awards going hostless for the first time since 1989 may have been a controversial move, but it seemed no-one really minded. That's probably because everyone was far too busy tweeting about Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper's sizzling chemistry or laughing about Trevor Noah trolling the audience. Here are some of the Oscar moments that ruled social media. 1. Trevor Noah's fake translation While introducing best picture nominee Black Panther, South African comedian Trevor Noah poked fun at people who think Wakanda, the fictional African nation in which it's set, is a real place. ""Growing up as a young boy in Wakanda, I would see T'Challa flying over our village, and he would remind me of a great Xhosa phrase,"" he said. ""'Abelungu abazi ubu ndiyaxoka', which means: 'In times like these, we are stronger when we fight together than when we try to fight apart."" And while it sounded beautiful and uplifting, that's not quite what the phrase actually means. The BBC'sPumza Fihlanisaid the actual translation into English is: ""White people don't know that I'm lying."" While most of the audience in Hollywood was none the wiser, Xhosa speakers on social media relished in the cheeky moment. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper's steamy duet Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper performed perhaps their steamiest rendition yet of Shallow, from their film A Star is Born. The pair gazed adoringly at each other as they sang the song, with Gaga standing opposite Cooper before taking her place behind the grand piano. As the song came to an end, Cooper sat beside Gaga and laid his head on hers as they belted out the final lyrics - which was probably around the same time Twitter imploded. Allow Twitter content?

"Referrals to the Tavistock Centre have risen by 400% in five years England's only NHS youth gender clinic is too quick to give children and young people gender reassignment treatment, a former governor has said. Psychoanalyst Dr Marcus Evans, who resigned last week, told the BBC's Today programme he had been concerned about clinicians searching for ""quick solutions"". ""This is the opposite of what needs to be done,"" he said. A director of the Tavistock Centre rejected his claims. Dr Evans resigned from his post as one of the governors of the Tavistock and Portman NHS Foundation Trust last week following an internal report that branded the Tavistock Centre ""not fit for purpose"". On Monday, he told Today: ""Adolescence and childhood is a time when people are developing socially and biologically - a time when young people are identifying with different groups, and with male and female aspects of themselves. ""There is pressure from the child who is in a distressed state, there is pressure from the family and the peer group and from the pro-trans lobbies - and all of this puts pressure on the clinician who may want to help the individual to resolve their distressed state by going along with a quick solution. ""There is a lot at stake here as these decisions have far reaching consequences."" Dr Evans called for more external oversight of the Tavistock Clinic. Transgender children: Delaying puberty Child, five, referred to trans clinic Over the past five years, the number of children referred to the Tavistock Centre has risen from 468 to 2,519 a year, a rise of more than 400%. And Dr Polly Carmichael, director of the Gender Identity Development Service (GIDS) at the Tavistock, accepted the centre was under pressure. But she said: ""The service has really long assessments over periods of time, with the specific aim of allowing young people to think about what is right for them. ""We've been under pressure for years from people that think we should go faster and now a more critical voice has emerged.""

"Labour has said it is prepared to back another EU referendum to prevent a ""damaging Tory Brexit"". Jeremy Corbyn has told Labour MPs the party will move to back another vote if their own proposed Brexit deal is rejected on Wednesday. Labour's Emily Thornberry said if the parliamentary process ended with a choice of no deal or the PM's deal, the public should decide. Theresa May is under growing pressure to delay the 29 March Brexit date. Labour have not yet made clear what their proposed referendum would be on, but a party briefing paper to MPs says that any referendum would need to have ""a credible Leave option and Remain"". The prime minister, who will update MPs on the negotiations on Tuesday, has insisted the UK can still leave next month as planned. The UK voted to leave the EU in a referendum in June 2016, but the withdrawal deal Mrs May negotiated with the EU has to be agreed by MPs - and it suffered a huge defeat by them last month. Mrs May has ruled out a ""meaningful vote"" on her Brexit deal this week - saying one would be held by 12 March - but she will give MPs the chance to have their say on how the next steps for Brexit. MPs will be able to table amendments to a government motion, putting forward their proposals on what they think should happen next. Theresa May 'focused' on leaving on time, despite calls for delay Which amendments will be tabled this week? EU sticks to Brexit script in final sprint Mr Corbyn has told his MPs that Mrs May is ""recklessly running down the clock"" in an attempt to ""force MPs to choose between her botched deal and a disastrous no deal"". He said Labour would also put down an amendment this week setting out its plan for a ""comprehensive customs union"" and ""close alignment"" with the single market. The amendment also sets out guarantees on rights and standards, protection for Britain's role in EU agencies and a security agreement which guarantees access to the European arrest warrant and ""vital"" shared databases, he said. The Labour leadership has moved to this position believing that, as things stand, a plan to hold another referendum would not get the votes it needs in Parliament. Right now, they reckon it's a promise they can make, but will probably never have to keep. But if, as this political moment implies, there is a total meltdown, the prime minister's deal falls and chaos beckons, the move tonight keeps Labour's options firmly open, and has a better shout at keeping anxious Labour Europhiles happy. In such volatile times it is, of course, not impossible that a majority for another vote could emerge. But there is already some angst over the move. Read more from Laura Labour has also said the party will support a cross-party amendment, proposed by Labour's Yvette Cooper and Tory MP Sir Oliver Letwin, designed to rule out the prospect of a no-deal exit. Mr Corbyn said: ""One way or another, we will do everything in our power to prevent no deal and oppose a damaging Tory Brexit based on Theresa May's overwhelmingly rejected deal. ""That's why, in line with our conference policy, we are committed to also putting forward or supporting an amendment in favour of a public vote to prevent a damaging Tory Brexit being forced on the country."" This video can not be played The BBC's Jonathan Blake explains the impact Jeremy Corbyn's move could have At their conference last autumn, Labour members backed a policy of keeping all options on the table, including holding another referendum, if it could not force a general election. However, many Labour MPs believe the party has been slowly distancing itself from that commitment after it failed to win a vote of no confidence against the government last month. This video can not be played Emily Thornberry: 'We need the people to break Brexit log jam' Nine Labour MPs have quit the party in the past week, partly in protest at its stance on Brexit. Shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer insisted the party would ""deliver"" on its promises. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Ms Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, told the BBC: ""What she [Theresa May] wants to do is just get herself into a position whereby she says it's my deal or no deal. ""We think both of those are disastrous, and so we will see what it is at the end of the parliamentary process - whether we are facing no deal or a disastrous Tory Brexit. ""But either should go before the people and we need to have the people to break the logjam."" Labour MP David Lammy, who backs a ""People's Vote"" on the terms of the UK's exit, welcomed the move by his party to ""back the principle"" of a referendum. ""Even if MPs can agree some sort of deal, it would be wrong to force it on the British people when we now know so many of the promises made in 2016 have been broken, and any deal will be worse than the one we've already got inside the EU,"" he said. June 2017- Labour's general election manifesto accepts referendum result March 2018- Shadow Northern Ireland secretary Owen Smithsacked for supporting second referendum on final deal September- Labour agrees if a general election cannot be achieved it ""must support all optionsâ¦ including a public vote"" 28th November- Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell says Labour will ""inevitably"" back a second referendum if unable to secure general election 16th January 2019- 71 Labour MPs say they support a public vote 21st January- Shadow International Trade Secretary Barry Gardiner says if a second referendum motion was put to MPs,Labour would support it 6th February- Mr Corbyn writes a letter to Mrs May outlining five changes with no mention of a ""People's Vote"" 25th February- Labour says it will back a public vote if its proposed Brexit deal is rejected on Wednesday Labour's Hilary Benn, who chairs the Commons Brexit committee, said talk of a referendum was still some way off as MPs would have another opportunity to vote on Theresa May's deal by 12 March. But if the deal was rejected, he said, it would ""open up"" a range of other possibilities, one of which would be to put the final decision ""in the people's hands"". Shadow education secretary Angela Rayner tweeted that if the prime minister did not support Labour's amendment, then ""the time has come"" to stop a no deal scenario with a public vote.

""That kid was struggling with his identity, trying to figure himself out, and to anyone struggling and trying to discover their voice - listen, we made a film about a gay man, an immigrant, who lived his life unapologetically himself.

"The sun is out in Folkestone, Kent The UK is experiencing its warmest February day on record, with the Met Office reporting a temperature of 20.6C (69.08F) at Trawsgoed, Ceredigion. It is the first time a temperature of over 20C has been recorded in winter. It breaks the UK's record for February, set when the temperature reached 19.7C  in Greenwich in 1998. A new English record has also been set with temperatures rising to 20.1C in Hampton Water Works, in south-west London. It is the second day running the Welsh record has been broken. On Sunday, temperatures reached 19.1C, breaking the record of 18.6C (65.48F) set 29 years ago in the south Wales village of Velindre. The BBC Weather Centre says Tuesday's weather conditions are likely to be very similar. It says to expect a largely sunny, but chilly, start with frost in places. The rest of the day will become increasingly warm with lengthy spells of sunshine, threatening February temperature records once again. The warmest areas are likely to be around the London area and across north and west Wales again. By Nick Miller, BBC Weather It's hard to believe that a year ago Britain was about to endure the worst of the so-called Beast from the East, with widespread snow and sub-zero temperatures. Fast forward 12 months and this record February warmth shows just how varied the UK weather can be. The reason temperatures have been so high is the direction our air is coming from. High pressure parked to the south east of the British Isles has been dragging warm air from Africa and the Canary Islands our way. Temperatures are further boosted bysomething known as the foehn effect, when air warms as it flows down the lee side of mountains. All of this combined with the sunshine has produced something quite remarkable for February. Caroline Lucas, the former leader of the Green Party, suggested the warm weather is linked to climate change. She said: ""I like spending an afternoon in the sunshine as much as anyone, but it's impossible to shake the feeling that this isn't right."" Tom Burke, of the independent climate change think tank E3G, said extreme warm weather events were exactly what climate change experts said would happen if people continued to put carbon into the atmosphere. With new records for temperature being set, and everyone seemingly dazzled by the unexpected heat, the obvious question is whether climate change has a role? The usual answer is that no single heatwave, storm or flood can be directly connected to global warming, and that's what the Met Office is saying now. ""We've had the warmest day of winter on record,"" says spokesman Grahame Madge, ""and it does fit a pattern of warming. ""But it would be simplistic to link this to climate change until a study has been carried out."" Previous research has shown how the odds of particular weather events - like last summer's heatwave - have been made more likely because of the increasing levels of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases heating up the atmosphere. And the projections for future global warming are clear that the kind of weather that feels strange now will appear normal in the decades ahead, as the underlying global average temperature rises. Met Office analysis of temperatures shows that British winters have become slightly milder over the past half century, a trend that's set to continue. The record UK temperature for a February day was broken in five different locations on Monday: Trawsgoed, Dyfed 20.6C Northolt, west London 20.4C Gogerddan, Dyfed 20.1C Bala, Gwynedd 20.0C Wisley, Surrey 19.9C Lewis Parfitt captured this snow covered pond in Christchurch park in Suffolk a year ago It was a totally different scene at the pond this February Pauline Daniels took this image during the ""Beast from the East"" in Suffolk in February 2018 This year Pauline captured clear blue skies and sunshine Last year, when RenÃ©e Lloyd took this image, the streets outside the Jamaican High Commission in London were covered in snow RenÃ©e thinks the Jamaican flag looks better when it's bathed in sunshine against a bright blue sky Are you enjoying the weather? 7 of the world's most extreme weather conditions Darren Tansley, a mammal ecologist at Essex Wildlife Trust, said the unseasonably warm weather could have a detrimental effect on hibernating species, such as dormice, hedgehogs and bats. He said: ""They could be coming out of hibernation too early, which means they're active at a time when really they should be reserving their body fat to get over the slack food period."" He also said these species could be looking for food that was not abundant at this time of year. Is it sunny where you are?

"Katie Price was found guilty of being in charge of a vehicle while over the limit TV star Katie Price has been convicted of being nearly twice the legal limit while in charge of her pink Range Rover. The 40-year-old argued she was not in control of the 4X4 when she was arrested in a drunken state in the back seat in Greenwich in the early hours of 10 October. She said that a mystery man had driven but Judge Nigel Dean found she was not a ""credible"" witness. She was banned for three months. A charge of drink-driving was dropped due to insufficient evidence. The three-month driving ban adds toanother from earlier this year for driving while disqualified, Bexley Magistrates' Court heard. Along with a Â£1,500 fine, Price was also ordered to pay costs and a victim surcharge to bring her total bill to Â£2,425. This video can not be played The ups and downs of Katie Price's life The court heard PCs Benjamin Jones and Balvinder Mann first saw the Range Rover veer off the road and hit a grass verge at 00:40 BST, before seeing it stationary about 15 minutes later. PC Jones told magistrates Price, of Horsham, West Sussex, was in a ""very"" drunken state in the back while her friend Kris Boyson was in the passenger seat. ""Her eyes were blurred and her speech was a bit slurred,"" he said. The officer said the bumper was hanging off, pieces of shrubbery were attached to the vehicle and there also ""appeared to be sick on the outside"". Price told the court she had drunk between three and four ""pornstar martini"" cocktails at Mr Boyson's 30th birthday party in a restaurant. She said she allowed one of his friends to drive the car back towards Mr Boyson's house near Bluewater - and did not remember any crash. ""I was really drunk. I'm such a lightweight,"" she said. Both Price and Mr Boyson claimed the unnamed driver had fled following an argument, the court heard. PC Jones said the pair claimed the driver had the key but the car's engine later turned on. Both officers were unable to ascertain who had been driving at the time. Prosecutor Sonya Saul told the court Price was taken for a breathalyser test at a police station. She had 69 microgrammes of alcohol per 100 millilitres of breath. The legal limit is 35 microgrammes.

"Sarah and Victoria Hicks were at the game with their parents The father of two teenagers who died at Hillsborough has told a court of the ""worst moment"" of his life as he travelled to hospital with one girl while her sister was on the pitch. Trevor Hicks went to the April 1989 match with Sarah, 19, and Victoria, 15. He told Preston Crown Court he warned police something was ""badly wrong"" as the crush developed. Match commander David Duckenfield, 74, denies the gross negligence manslaughter of 95 Liverpool fans. Mr Hicks said the two girls had been in the central pens of the Leppings Lane terrace while he had been in a pen to the side and his wife Jenni was in the North Stand for the FA Cup semi-final. He said as kick-off approached the pens seemed ""very full"" and it was clear there were problems. Mr Hicks said he and another man, whose son was in one of the pens, shouted up to a police officer on the gantry next to the police control box. He said: ""We were basically shouting 'look, can't you see things are going badly wrong'."" Asked how the police officer responded, he said he was sworn at and told to ""shut my... prattle'."" The jury was shown a picture of Trevor Hicks' position beneath the Hillsborough police control box Mr Hicks said he went on to the pitch where he found the girls lying ""almost side by side"". He then went in an ambulance to hospital with Victoria while Sarah was still being treated on the pitch. ""I had two daughters, only one with me,"" he said. ""Obviously they both needed attention, we thought they were both alive. ""The best thing to do was go with Victoria expecting that the other ambulance would follow and Sarah would be along very quickly."" Match commander David Duckenfield denies the gross negligence manslaughter of 95 fans Mr and Mrs Hicks later identified their daughters at the stadium's gymnasium. The court earlier heard from Barry Devonside whose son Christopher, 18, died at Hillsborough. He said he ""froze in fear"" as he saw a crush develop in pens where his son was standing. Mr Devonside was in the stadium's North Stand, separate from his son, who had been allocated a ticket on the Leppings Lane terraces alongside friends. Christopher Devonside was standing on the Leppings Lane terraces with schoolfriends He said he did not see the start of the game because he was concerned at the scenes in the pens after being involved in a crush at the same fixture at Hillsborough a year earlier. After seeing two fans being resuscitated, he turned to a man with a transistor radio to ask what was happening and was told ""there's two dead"", the court heard. He said police lined up across the centre of the pitch but ""did nothing to help the injured or dying or the removal of those who were killed"". Mr Devonside told the jury: ""I also saw police officers pushing back into pen three those who were fighting for their life to get out of that pen."" He added he was ""treated like dirt"" and sent away by a policeman at the ground's gymnasium when he went to look for his son. Barry Devonside said some police officers ""did absolutely nothing"" to help the injured or dying He spent five hours visiting hospitals and mortuaries before going back to the gym, where his son's body was being stored, the court heard. Earlier the court heard from off-duty Metropolitan Police officer Steven Allen who was in pen three. He said it ""was becoming obvious that there was something wrong"" and waved his warrant card at South Yorkshire Police officers to get their attention and warn them. ""People were shouting in agony,"" he said. ""People were screaming. People were in pain. People were asking to be let out."" The people who lost their lives in the Hillsborough disaster Mr Duckenfield, of Ferndown, Dorset, is on trial alongside Sheffield Wednesday's ex-club secretary Graham Mackrell, 69, who denies a charge related to the stadium safety certificate and a health and safety charge.

"A Lebanese supporter carries a Hezbollah flag in Beirut The UK Parliament is set to pass new rules classifying Hezbollah as a terrorist group. Parts of the Lebanese organisation have been proscribed since 2001, with its military wing banned since 2008. UK authorities say they are no longer able to distinguish between the group's military and political wings. The changes are expected to take force from Friday, after which supporting Hezbollah will be an offence carrying a sentence of up to 10 years in prison. Hezbollah - translated as the Party of God - is a Shia Islamist political, military and social organisation that wields considerable power in Lebanon. Profile: Lebanon's Hezbollah Home Secretary Sajid Javid said he had decided to proscribe the group in its entirety because Hezbollah was ""continuing in its attempts to destabilise the fragile situation in the Middle East"". The group, which is backed by Iran, has sent thousands of its fighters to Syria to support forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad in battles against predominantly Sunni Muslim rebel forces and the jihadist Islamic State group. Last month,Hezbollah was awarded three cabinet posts in the newly-formed Lebanese cabinetafter it made gains, alongside its allies, in the 2018 parliamentary elections. Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt echoed Mr Javid's comments, adding that the government could not be complacent about terrorism. ""It is clear the distinction between Hezbollah's military and political wings does not exist, and by proscribing Hezbollah in all its forms, the government is sending a clear signal that its destabilising activities in the region are totally unacceptable and detrimental to the UK's national security,"" he said. Mr Javid's Israeli counterpart Gilad Erdan welcomed the decision on Twitter and called on the EU to follow suit. Hezbollah was formed as a resistance movement during the Israeli occupation of southern Lebanon in the early 1980s. The militant group's capture of two Israeli soldiers in a cross-border attack led to a month-long war with Israel in 2006. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

In addition to Hezbollah, the draft order also proscribes Ansaroul Islam and Jamaat Nusrat al-Islam Wal-Muslimin (JNIM) as terrorist organisations. Ansaroul Islam and JNIM are militant Islamist groups active in West Africa - both have claimed responsibility for attacks in the region. The order - which is expected to be approved by Parliament - will become active from Friday and will put Britain in line with other countries including the US. UK ban for Hezbollah political wing?

"Katie Price was found guilty of being in charge of a vehicle while over the limit TV star Katie Price has been convicted of being nearly twice the legal limit while in charge of her pink Range Rover. The 40-year-old argued she was not in control of the 4X4 when she was arrested in a drunken state in the back seat in Greenwich in the early hours of 10 October. She said that a mystery man had driven but Judge Nigel Dean found she was not a ""credible"" witness. She was banned for three months. A charge of drink-driving was dropped due to insufficient evidence. The three-month driving ban adds toanother from earlier this year for driving while disqualified, Bexley Magistrates' Court heard. Along with a Â£1,500 fine, Price was also ordered to pay costs and a victim surcharge to bring her total bill to Â£2,425. This video can not be played The ups and downs of Katie Price's life The court heard PCs Benjamin Jones and Balvinder Mann first saw the Range Rover veer off the road and hit a grass verge at 00:40 BST, before seeing it stationary about 15 minutes later. PC Jones told magistrates Price, of Horsham, West Sussex, was in a ""very"" drunken state in the back while her friend Kris Boyson was in the passenger seat. ""Her eyes were blurred and her speech was a bit slurred,"" he said. The officer said the bumper was hanging off, pieces of shrubbery were attached to the vehicle and there also ""appeared to be sick on the outside"". Price told the court she had drunk between three and four ""pornstar martini"" cocktails at Mr Boyson's 30th birthday party in a restaurant. She said she allowed one of his friends to drive the car back towards Mr Boyson's house near Bluewater - and did not remember any crash. ""I was really drunk. I'm such a lightweight,"" she said. Both Price and Mr Boyson claimed the unnamed driver had fled following an argument, the court heard. PC Jones said the pair claimed the driver had the key but the car's engine later turned on. Both officers were unable to ascertain who had been driving at the time. Prosecutor Sonya Saul told the court Price was taken for a breathalyser test at a police station. She had 69 microgrammes of alcohol per 100 millilitres of breath. The legal limit is 35 microgrammes. Speaking outside court after the sentencing, Price told reporters: ""It got proven today there was no evidence at all of me drink-driving so I rest my case on that.""

"Primary and secondary pupils in England will learn about relationships, keeping safe online and looking after their mental health as part of compulsory lessons from September next year. Children in primary schools will have relationships education and this will be broadened to relationships and sex education in secondary schools. Health education for all ages will also be part of the curriculum in England. Parents will still have the right to withdraw their child up to age 15. However, head teachers are expected to talk to parents who wish to exclude their child from these lessons, ""discussing with the parents the benefits of receiving this important education and any detrimental effects that withdrawal might have on the child"". Under new compulsory health education lessons, primary children will be taught about how to look after their own mental wellbeing and also to recognise when their classmates might be struggling. They will cover why simple self-care, such as getting enough sleep and spending time outdoors and with friends, is important. Teaching about the excessive use of electronic devices and limiting time spent online is also included. In terms of relationships education, primary children will also be taught age-appropriate online safety - including what to do if they come across things they are uncomfortable with, the importance of respect for others even when posting anonymously and the risks of talking to people on the internet who they don't know in real life. Secondary-age pupils will also have health education, focusing on mental health. The curriculum will aim to ensure that young people can spot the signs of common mental illnesses, such as anxiety and depression in themselves or others. They will learn how to discuss their emotions accurately and sensitively and how to access professional help. They will also cover the impact of alcohol and drugs on physical and mental health. Parents protest over LGBT rights teaching 'Teach kids about same-sex couples' Period health to be taught in English schools Children to be taught about FGM harm 'Get up and out': Helping teenagers beat the blues Young mums: Sex ed 'must cover respect' In terms of sex and relationships, lessons will cover online safety topics, including the serious risks of sharing private photos, the impact of viewing explicit or harmful content - including how to report it and receive support. Lessons will cover how the internet can promote an unhealthy view of sex and relationships. The guidance says that pupils need to understand ""that some people are LGBT [lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender], that this should be respected in British society, and that the law affords them and their relationships recognition and protections"". The guidance adds: ""Schools should make decisions about what it is appropriate to teach on this subject and when, based on the age, development and religious backgrounds of their pupils, and should involve their parents in these decisions."" Secondary-age pupils will also be taught about female genital mutilation (FGM) - focusing on awareness, the availability of support networks and reminding them that it is illegal. Online safety will be covered The government says they should also be taught about other forms of honour-based abuse, as well as grooming, forced marriage and domestic abuse. Schools will decide how frequently to hold age-appropriate lessons. Thenew guidance,externalfollows an extensive call for evidence and a three-month consultation, which received more than 11,000 responses. There are certainly groups who have concerns about what issues are covered in RSE and who feel some topics should not be taught by schools. The Parent Power advice website says parents should be able to educate children in line with their own religious faith. Linda Rose, from the group, says she is not convinced by promises that teaching will be age appropriate. ""Children are given too much information too young and don't have the emotional maturity to process all this information,"" she says. ""We are worried that this isn't upholding religion as a protected characteristic with equal value to the other protected characteristics."" Recently, a group ofMuslim parents in Birmingham protestedover their children being taught about LGBT rights and homophobia. Also,a petition calling for parents to have the right to opt their child out of sex education lessons,externalhas attracted more than 106,000 signatures. It says: ""We believe it is the parent's fundamental right to teach their child RSE topics or to at least decide who teaches them and when and how they are taught. ""We want the right to opt our children out of RSE when it becomes mandatory in Sept 2020. ""We have grave concerns about the physical, psychological and spiritual implications of teaching children about certain sexual and relational concepts proposed in RSE and believe that they have no place within a mandatory school curriculum."" Speaking in the House of Commons on Monday, Education Secretary Damian Hinds said  Â£6m would be made available in 2019/20 to cover training and resources. Mr Hinds said: ""Growing up and adolescence are hard enough, but the internet and social media add new pressures that just weren't there even one generation ago. ""Almost 20 years on from the last time guidance on sex education was updated, there is a lot to catch up on."" Mr Hinds says new guidance is needed to reflect a changed world Mr Hinds adds that it is ""appropriate"" to make health education universal alongside relationships and sex education. ""It will help children learn how to look after themselves, physically and mentally, and the importance of getting away from the screen and the headphones. ""And it can help young people be resilient as they chart a course through an ever more complex world."" Charities have been generally positive about the government's new guidelines. The NSPCC said the guidance would help children ""navigate the modern world"". Head of policy, Almudena Lara, said: ""The NSPCC firmly believes that every child should be taught from an early age about consent, different relationships, and what abuse and harassment is, so that they learn they have the right to be treated with dignity and respect. ""Teachers must receive high-quality training and support to deliver the new curriculum, so that every school across the country meets the same high standards."" The Catholic Education Service said it  welcomed the government's announcement. Director Paul Barber said:  ""Catholic education is centred on the formation of the whole child and age-appropriate RSE is an essential part of this. ""It is essential for creating well-rounded young people, for equipping students to make good life choices and for keeping our children safe."" Anna Feuchtwang, chief executive of campaign group the National Children's Bureau, said the guidance was ""a welcome step forward in preparing children for adulthood, improving their well-being and keeping them safe and healthy"".

"Emiliano Sala's body was found in the plane's wreckage The pilot of the plane that crashed with Cardiff City striker Emiliano Sala on board did not have a licence for commercial flights, investigators say. The Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) confirmed David Ibbotson held a private pilot's licence. Itsinterim report,externalsaid he could only fly passengers in the EU on a cost sharing basis, not for reward. Cardiff City said it had ""grave concerns"" and questions over the validity of the pilot's licence. Investigators have not yet been able to establish what arrangement Mr Ibbotson had with Sala, and the status of the 59-year-old's licence at the time of the crash on 21 January will form part of the AAIB's investigations. Who owned the plane Sala died in? Family's tribute after Sala plane death Deadline for Sala payment extended The wreckage was found in three parts on the seabed of the English Channel Sala was found in the wreckage of the Piper Malibu N264DB, which was found on the seabed 13 days after it vanished over the English Channel near Guernsey. He had completed his transfer to Premier League side Cardiff from French club Nantes just two days earlier - for a club record fee of Â£15m - and had returned to France to say goodbye to his former teammates. Mr Ibbotson has not yet been found and his family hope a fresh search for his body will begin this week after setting up an online fundraising campaign which has raised Â£250,000. The aircraft remains underwater off the coast of Guernsey after an attempt to recover it was hampered by bad weather. The Piper Malibu N264DB aircraft was taking Sala from Nantes to Cardiff As flying is an expensive pastime, cost sharing allows pilots to notch up their flying hours while sharing the cost of fuel, landing fees and other expenses with passengers. The AAIB report said the basis on which Sala was being carried on N264DB ""has not yet been established but, previously, the pilot had carried passengers on the basis of 'cost sharing'"". Cost sharing on private flights is allowed in the UK and the report said Mr Ibbotson, of Crowle, North Lincolnshire, had operated these type of flights before. However, the report added that because the aircraft was US-registered, it was subject to Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulations, which meant he could only make the flight legally if he was paying half the operating expenses. In addition, Mr Ibbotson needed a ""bona fide purpose"" for making the flight - also known in aviation as ""common purpose"" - and must dictate when the flight should leave, the report added. Emiliano Sala (left) was on board a plane being flown by pilot David Ibbotson It is understood the flight's departure was delayed to allow Sala to say goodbye to his Nantes teammates before he left. The report said that, on the basis of a cost-sharing flight, it ""must not be made for the purpose of merely transporting the passenger"". This is one area the AAIB said needed further investigation. The AAIB released this photograph of the wreckage of the Piper Malibu The AAIB said the plane was found in three parts on the seabed after a submersible with cameras was sent underwater. It was ""extensively damaged"" and the wreckage was held together by electrical and flying control cables, while the engine was disconnected from the cockpit area. The AAIB said it had been unable to establish how much flying Mr Ibbotson had done recently, as his pilot's licence and logbook had been lost. Investigators would normally look to establish how many hours a pilot had flown in the preceding 28 and 90 days before a crash. Mr Ibbotson had approximately 3,700 flying hours and held a private pilot's licence in the UK and US. Air accident investigators will continue to look at all ""operational, technical, organisational and human factors"" which might have contributed to the crash. One focus will be further analysis of the radar information to try and understand the final moments of the flight. Investigators will analyse video from the wreckage in a bid to determine how the aircraft entered the sea. An AAIB spokesman said: ""We have gathered evidence from radar, weather reports, video of the aircraft on the seabed and interviews with witnesses. ""Some operational aspects are yet to be determined, such as the validity of the pilot's licence and ratings. ""Our priority now is to go through the evidence, much of which is extensive and complex, so we can piece together what happened between the aircraft being lost from radar and it coming to rest on the sea bed.

"This video can not be played Why is it difficult to know exactly how many people sleep rough? Deaths of homeless people were nine times higher in deprived areas of England than in the least disadvantaged areas, analysis of data has shown. There were an estimated 21 deaths in Manchester, 18 in Birmingham, 17 each in Bristol, Lambeth and Liverpool and 15 in Camden in 2017. About 2,627 homeless people died in England and Wales from 2013 to 2017. Deaths were recorded in 156 local authority areas in 2017, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. When weighted by population, the 11 deaths estimated in Blackburn with Darwen gave the area the highest rate. Housing charity Shelter said the figures were a ""wake-up call"". Chief executive Polly Neate said: ""There is nothing inevitable about people dying homeless, it is a direct consequence of a broken housing system."" Jon Sparkes, chief executive of Crisis, said councils needed ""appropriate funding to conduct reviews into the death of every person who has died while homeless, to prevent more people from dying needlessly"". The breakdownfollowed the release of figures for England and Wales in December, with an estimate of 574 homeless deaths in urban areas in 2017, compared with 26 in rural areas. Analysis of confirmed deaths in England over five years,externalshowed almost a quarter were in the 10% of areas officially ranked as the most deprived. The ONS said: ""The rate of deaths per 100,000 population in the most deprived tenth of local areas in England was 9.2 times that of the least deprived tenth. ""For Wales, the rate of deaths per 100,000 population in the most deprived tenth of local areas was 3.4 times that of the least deprived tenth."" The ONS included people sleeping rough or using emergency accommodation, such as homeless shelters and hostels, at or around the time of death. 'Art helped lift me out of homelessness' Talk to homeless, says killed man's sister Reality Check: Who is homeless? Ben Humberstone, head of health analysis for the ONS, said: ""The figures show that the deprivation level of an area has a real impact. Many more people die homeless in the most deprived areas of England and Wales and 95% of the deaths are in urban areas rather than rural areas."" Sayyed Osman, Blackburn with Darwen Council's director of adults and prevention, said: ""The issues here are complex and made worse by the fact we have a disproportionate amount of hostels which people from out of our borough are coming to use which in turn puts further pressure on limited resource and services. ""These are major issues affecting towns and cities across the country and there are no quick or easy solutions and this is certainly not something that the council can deal with in isolation."" The number of people counted or estimated to be sleeping rough in Englandfell slightly in 2018 for the first time in eight years. The government said it was investing Â£1.2bn to tackle homelessness. Communities secretary James Brokenshire said: ""Councils have used this funding to create an additional 1,750 beds and 500 rough sleeping support staff - and figures published last month show this investment is already starting to have an effect. ""I am also committed to ensuring independent reviews into the deaths of rough sleepers are conducted, where appropriate, so that important lessons are learned - and I will be holding local authorities to account in doing just that.""

"Rami Malek, Olivia Colman, Regina King and Mahershala Ali pose with their Oscars The first Oscars to go ahead without a host since 1989 was an unqualified success - the best ceremony in years, packed with memorable moments and for (nearly) all the right reasons. Without the need to fit in all the monologues, skits and handovers that are the mainstay of a host's work, time was available for far better speeches and emotional punches; the announcing of a winner given a precious few extra seconds for its meaning to really take root. Kevin Hart's decision to take himself out of the hosting duties following the resurfacing of homophobic tweets had initially presented the Academy with a huge problem. Suddenly the job looked like a poisoned chalice. Olivia Colman's varied career in pictures Olivia Colman and Green Book win Oscars Oscars 2019: Winners and nominees in full Which Oscars outfits have caused a stir? In pictures: Red carpet glamour Who was a big enough name who had so little troublesome material in their back catalogue that they, too, wouldn't feel a Twitter backlash the moment they were announced? No-one, it seemed. So the Oscars went hostless for the first time since the disastrous 1989 show, regarded as the worst in history - though this actually was nothing to do with not having a host; the awfulness was down to some badly misguided song-and-dance routines. A look back at the 'debacle' of 1989's hostless Oscars And it went so well, it would almost be a surprise if they bother with a host again. Faced with only a few weeks to pull a whole new show together, the producers had two brilliant ideas. Maya Rudolph, Tina Fey and Amy Poehler gave the closest the awards got to an opening monologue The first was to get Tiny Fey, Amy Poehler and Maya Rudolph to effectively do the traditional opening monologue (after an opening performance from Queen, which got most people mildly waving an arm around, in a we've-not-really-had-enough-to-drink-yet-but-OK kind of way). Fey and Poehler had hosted the Golden Globes before and had been tipped as potential Oscars hosts; this was near-as-dammit them doing it, except they (with Rudolph) did a show's worth of material in two minutes. Fey and Poehler: Dream Golden Globes double act ""We're not hosting, but if we were, these are the jokes we would make"" was their take. It was very post-modern but it really worked. They raced through so many references - to Netflix; to Fyre Festival; to Donald Trump's wall; to the show's chaotic recent months and the wrangling over taking out awards - it was hard to keep up. ""We won't be doing awards during the commercials, but we will be presenting commercials during the awards,"" said Poehler. ""So if all the winners could all say Hellman's Mayonnaise: We're on the side of food instead of their speeches, that would be great."" And then they left. All killer lines. No padding, no filler, no flannel. Brilliant. The other great idea was to expand the range of people announcing the nominees for best picture. Now that eight films are in contention, each gets a little spot where a celebrity introduces them. It's usually actors who do this, of course - but this time around, Serena Williams, Trevor Noah and Tom Morello from Rage Against The Machine all got a go. Serena Williams made a welcome appearance on stage It even meant that Mike Myers and Dana Carvey could reprise their roles as Wayne and Garth from Wayne's World. It was fun, it expanded the diversity of presenters, and it worked. And it was the first Oscars where there was no groaner, no badly-received dig or in-joke that was just too in. Awkward moments - such as the make-up crew from Vice struggling desperately to read their speech - came solely from the award winners. (Well, that and Samuel L Jackson having to hand over a best original screenplay Oscar to Green Book. As good an actor as Jackson is - and there are few better - he could not act happy for that.) But the good moments - of which there were many - were allowed to breathe and stand out so much because they weren't rushed in order to fit the meaningless skits that exist just to give the host something to do, like when Jimmy Kimmel brought in a busload of tourists to confusedly mill around the Dolby Theatre. So when Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper sang Shallow together, the camera could linger on them as the song finished rather than rushing off - thus providing an iconic Oscar image for years to come. And when Olivia Colman won best actress, she got some proper time to say what she wanted as the tears rolled down her face. She talked about her children and she talked about young girls watching and practising their own acceptance speeches. It was touching and wonderful. Olivia Colman is the first British best female winner in 10 years (Colman's life story could one day be an Oscar-winning film in itself - from the low of Confetti, when the film-makers went back on a promise to pixelate her nudity, to winning an Academy Award.  Confetti's director, meanwhile, has since made four Nativity films; thus far they have all been untroubled by Oscar nominations.) And there was also the sheer joy when - a minute after having to hold his nose with the Green Book award, Samuel L Jackson got to give best adapted screenplay to BlacKkKlansman's writer ""Spike LEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!"" Spike Lee won his first Oscar at the ceremony It was Lee's first win at the fifth time of being nominated. He made the most overtly political speech of the night: ""The 2020 presidential election is around the corner. ""Let's all mobilise. Let's all be be on the right side of history. Make the moral choice between love versus hate. Let's do the right thing."" But there were several heartfelt references from the wide variety of winners from different backgrounds to political issues. Javier Bardem spoke - in Spanish, with subtitles, a first - of how ""there are no borders or walls that can restrain ingenuity or talent"". Chef Jose Andres spoke of ""immigrants and women, who move humanity forward"". Melissa Berton and Rayka Zehtabchi's speech was emotionally charged as they collected the documentary award for Period The winners of best short documentary for Period. End Of Sentence talked of the enormous issues that still exist around access to sanitary products. Meanwhile, the one thing that went unmentioned was the name of Bohemian Rhapsody's director, Bryan Singer - currently the subject of claims that he has sexually abused boys and men;claims he has denied. Every time Bohemian Rhapsody won, it was the members of Queen who were thanked instead. Then Green Book won best film, and the whole mood dropped a notch. For doing that, the Academy itself deserves a collective Naked Gun Oscars-audience-slap-themselves-on-the-head gif. Never mind. They need never bother with a host again.

"Theresa May is meeting with EU leaders, including Germany's Angela Merkel, in Sharm-el-Sheikh Theresa May is facing growing calls to say she would delay Brexit rather than leave the EU if no deal is in place by the end of March. A new plan from some Tory MPs suggests ministers postpone Brexit until 23 May ""to conclude negotiations"". It is being suggested as an alternative to cross-party proposals which would see MPs take control of the process. Dutch PM Mark Rutte warned Mrs May the UK was ""sleepwalking into a no-deal scenario"" and needed to ""wake up"". The pair met at a summit in Egypt, as she presses EU leaders for more concessions to her deal. Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar described a no-deal Brexit as a ""lose-lose-lose scenario for everyone"", buthe told reporters ahead of a meeting with Mrs May that he thought the outcome was unlikely. This video can not be played Rutte: 'Wake up and close the Brexit deal' Mrs Mayannounced on Sunday that MPs will get a fresh vote on her dealby 12 March, vowing that leaving as planned 17 days later was ""within our grasp"". But many MPs had wanted another so-called ""meaningful vote"" sooner than that, and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn suggested Mrs May was ""running down the clock"" until a time when MPs were forced ""to choose between her bad deal and a disastrous no deal"". Mrs May's announcement also provoked disappointment among business leaders, who are clamouring for certainty about what is to come. Brexit: A really simple guide Ireland 'not playing chicken' What preparations are being made for no-deal? No-deal Brexit risks 'economic crisis' The prime minister had a ""good, friendly"" 45-minute meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on the sidelines of the EU-League of Arab States summit in Sharm-el-Sheikh. A government official said they discussed Brexit, among other things, and the issue of extending Article 50 came up ""fleetingly"". But they said Mrs May reiterated that the UK wanted to leave the EU with a deal on the scheduled date of 29 March. European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker also met the PM and said they had a ""good, constructive"" meeting. President of the European Council, Donald Tusk, said he had also discussed a ""potential extension"" to Article 50 when he met the PM on Monday, but he said it was ""absolutely clear"" to him that there was no majority in the House of Commons to approve any deal. ""We will face an alternative, chaotic Brexit or an extension,"" he said. ""The less time there is until 29 March, the greater the likelihood of an extension, and this is an objective fact - not our intention, not our plan, but an objective fact."" He said an extension would be a ""rational solution"" but that Mrs May told him ""she still believes she is able to avoid this scenario."" There will be further talks in Brussels on Tuesday on the Northern Ireland backstop - the number one sticking point for many when it comes to the Brexit deal. Theresa May also met Jean-Claude Juncker at the summit The prime minister has long resisted any suggestion that the UK's departure could be postponed beyond 29 March. But political editor Laura Kuenssberg says two cabinet ministers have told the BBC they believe she will this week grant some kind of concession to allow for a possible delay. Such a move, though, would inevitably anger Brexiteers who want the UK to leave as planned, whatever the cost. Please upgrade your browser On Wednesday, MPs will get another chance to put forward a range of amendments in the Commons to show what direction they want Brexit to take. One - drawn up by Labour's Yvette Cooper and Conservative Oliver Letwin - would, if passed, give MPs the power to demand a delay to Brexit if a deal cannot be agreed by 13 March. Three cabinet ministers, Greg Clark, Amber Rudd and David Gauke,signalled they could be prepared to vote for itif there is no breakthrough in the next few days. Ms Cooper told the BBC that the move was not intended to stop Brexit as it would be up to the government, not Parliament, to determine the length of any delay. Ms Rudd told reporters on Monday morning that she was ""completely committed"" to making sure the UK leaves the EU and she supported the prime minister. But, she added: ""What I don't think is acceptable is plans to move ever closer to no deal."" Monday:The PM meets with EU leaders, including Angela Merkel and Jean-Claude Junker, on the fringes of the EU-League of Arab States summit. Tuesday:Mrs May gives a statement to the House of Commons updating them on her progress on Brexit. Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay and Attorney General Geoffrey Cox return to Brussels to continue talks with the EU. Wednesday:MPs debate an amendable motion tabled by the government. Speaker John Bercow chooses which amendments to put forward, and MPs vote on the next step proposals. There's also the proposal of a new amendment from a group of Conservative backbenchers, led by Andrew Percy and Simon Hart, which calls for a ""strictly time limited"" delay to Brexit if there is no formal deal by 13 March. It would avoid handing control of Brexit to Parliament, and its proposers hope it will attract support from MPs who have indicated they might support the Cooper-Letwin amendment a ""last resort"" to avoid no-deal, as well as colleagues who are relaxed about no-deal, on the basis that it will provide more time for planning. Defence Minister Tobias Ellwood told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he was ""encouraging"" the prime minister to announce a delay to prevent a no-deal Brexit. But Education Secretary Damian Hinds said a delay would ""just prolong these issues"". It's absolutely plain that Theresa May doesn't want to delay Brexit in any way. An extension, in her view, doesn't solve any of the dilemmas. But she has also never actually 100% said that she would never, ever, ever end up doing that. Simply, she can't, because Parliament might take the decision out of her hands, or the prospect of a defeat might force her to move. Indeed, a senior figure in government is convinced that Number 10 will find a way, if the votes are stacking up, of taking leaving without a deal off the table by implication, next week. Read more from Laura Labour is also likely to table an amendment on Wednesday, putting its own Brexit plan - one which backs a permanent customs union with the EU and a close relationship with its single market - to MPs. That move could take the party a step closer to supporting another EU referendum. Theresa May is continuing to push Brussels for extra legal promises that the backstop - the controversial policy that aims to prevent a hard border returning to the island of Ireland - would, if ever implemented, be temporary. UK proposals include ""alternative arrangements"", seeking a time limit to the backstop or agreeing a way the UK can choose to leave it at any time. However,Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney warnedon Sunday that the EU would not re-open the withdrawal agreement, adding his government could not be asked to ""compromise on something as fundamental as the peace process"", on which the border played a key part.

"This video can not be played The row was captured by passenger David Lawrence, who spoke to BBC Radio 5 live about what happened A Ryanair passenger who was filmed launching a tirade at an elderly woman on a flight has not had any charges filed against him. David Mesher was on a flight from Barcelona to Stansted on 19 October whenhe began insulting Delsie Gayle. Essex Police said it had sought advice and presented what evidence it could to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS). But, as the exchange took place in Spain, it said the CPS advised it had no jurisdiction to charge Mr Mesher. Essex Police said it was in touch with Spanish legal authorities about how to proceed. The Spanish authorities have been approached to comment. The tirade took place while the plane was on the tarmac at Barcelona Airport before the plane departed for Stansted. It was filmed by a fellow passenger and posted on social media where it racked up millions of views. In the footage, Mr Mesher can be heard using racial slurs to Delsie Gayle and threatening to ""push"" her to another seat. He shouts at her: ""Don't talk to me in a foreign language, you stupid ugly cow."" Ryanair rant man says 'I'm no racist' Barcelona support for Ryanair race victim 'Racist' flight rant man identified Previously, Mr Mesher, from Birmingham, told ITV's Good Morning Britain he was  ""not a racist person by any means"" and it was ""just a fit of temper at the time"". Delsie Gayle and daughter Carole rejected David Mesher's apology A spokeswoman for the CPS said the police had not officially submitted a file to the service in order for it to consider a charging decision. ""We cannot charge unless a file is submitted by the police"", she added. ""We conducted a thorough investigation and sought advice from the Crown Prosecution Service"", a spokesman for Essex Police said. ""They [the CPS] did not have the jurisdiction to advise on any charging decision. ""We have completed our enquiries as far as we are legally able to, given that the incident did not happen within our jurisdiction, and are now in contact with the Spanish legal authorities so that they can determine how they wish to proceed.""

"There were four people in one room, two in the bathroom and one in a room the size of a cupboard Thirteen people were found ""absolutely packed"" into a three-bedroom house in Newcastle, the BBC has found. The bath had been ripped out and a bunk bed put in its place, officials found when they visited the property in Ponteland Road, Blakelaw, in January. None of the people, who were restaurant workers, knew each other, Paula Davis from Newcastle City Council said. The council is now pursuing the private landlord for operating a house in multiple occupation without a licence. Paula Davis said the people were ""packed in"" the house The Home Office said of the 13, three women and seven men aged between 20 and 51 were arrested for either overstaying their visas or on suspicion of obtaining leave to enter the UK by deception. Four have subsequently been removed from the UK and one remains detained pending their removal from the UK. Three have made further immigration applications and must report regularly to the Home Office while their cases are dealt with. Two faced no further action. More than one in 10 privately-rented homes across the North East are unfit to live in, according to the Ministry for Housing, Communities and Local Government. Newcastle Council said it dealt with some 1,200 complaints each year. The BBC's Inside Out went out with the council's environmental health officers and saw properties with no heating, hot water or smoke alarms. Other houses visited had mould growing on the walls Others had broken sockets which carried a risk of electrocution, windows and doors that did not open and mould on the walls. Ms Davis, the council's public protection and neighbourhoods team manager, told Inside Out: ""There are an awful lot of vulnerable tenants, old people, young people, people who have migrated to the city and maybe don't speak English as a first language. ""They wouldn't know who to complain to. That's the group of people we are most concerned about and we most want to help."" Firms helping break housing laws 'Micro-homes could solve' housing crisis Millions of homes 'needed to solve crisis' Landlords who ignore their responsibilities could face a fine from the council of up to Â£30,000 per offence. Newcastle council only took on these powers recently and it is yet to use them. Some properties are left in disrepair for the new tenants But plans are under way to extend its licensing programme to cover more than 18,000 properties. Landlords would need pay up to Â£750 a home for a permit guaranteeing it was up to scratch. Newcastle City Council deputy leader Joyce McCarty said: ""The money we get can't be used for anything other than the scheme. ""That income will provide us with a team of officers who can support landlords and make sure the tenants are living in decent homes."" But she admitted the scheme would ""probably"" push rents up for tenants. The National Landlords Association said: ""We do not support the scheme as Newcastle council lacked the evidence to support its introduction... they would be better off taking a more targeted approach.""

"Tom Watson and Jeremy Corbyn in the Commons Disaffected Labour MPs are to be asked to join a new group within the party in a bid to avoid further resignations. The move, led by deputy leader Tom Watson, is intended to give more of a voice to MPs from Labour's social democratic tradition. Nine MPs from that wing of the party left Labour last week, criticising the party's leadership and direction. Mr Watson claimed on Sunday that the new internal grouping was the only way to hold the party together. He said it would give a platform to MPs whose views were not currently represented in Jeremy Corbyn's shadow cabinet and a chance for them to discuss and shape policy. A source close to Mr Corbyn said more discussion about policy was a good thing and had been a hallmark of his leadership, but signalled there would be no major shift away from current policies which were popular with voters. Nine Labour MPsquit the party last week, accusing Mr Corbyn of a ""lurch to the left"" and tolerating a culture of bullying and anti-Semitism in the party. Latest MP to quit Labour 'ashamed' of party Corbyn must 'lead' on tackling anti-Semitism Labour defectors betrayed seats, says Thornberry The MPs leaving their parties Mr Watson, whose close friend Ian Austin is among those who have left, warned there was a ""crisis for the soul"" of the party and urgent action was needed. In creating the new grouping, Mr Watson insisted he was not stoking a rebellion against Mr Corbyn but standing up for pluralism within the party. The BBC's political correspondent Iain Watson It's likely there will be a meeting of the new group in the next 48 hours - because allies of Labour's deputy leader say this is ""urgent"" if further defections are to be staved off. And I'm told the group could attract a substantial number of MPs, including former ministers. It won't just be a kind of support group for those who feel disillusioned, and thinking of defecting. The intention is to give these MPs more influence, and they will undertake proper policy work. But there could be an iron fist in this velvet glove. At the moment we are seeing a steady trickle of Labour MPs leaving. If, however, a much larger group feel subsequently that their ideas are being ignored, then - as one source put it - there is ""strength in numbers"". So Jeremy Corbyn could be told - change position or face not a splinter, but a proper split. The Labour leader, himself, will be addressing his MPs behind closed doors in Parliament tonight. And how he handles the defections, the new grouping - and much else besides - could determine if anyone else walks out of the party soon. With the Independent Group of MPs convening their inaugural ""business meeting"" later today, then the disillusioned know they have the option of travelling to a different political destination. Shadow health secretary Jon Ashworth said he regarded himself as a social democrat in the mould of Tony Crosland, the former Labour cabinet minister, and he felt able to speak out during shadow cabinet. But he told the BBC's Politics Live that he recognised some Labour MPs felt they needed a ""greater platform"". ""I would say to all colleagues, you have a contribution to make,"" he said. ""There is room for different voices."" What does it feel like to quit a party? A guide to Labour anti-Semitism claims The move was also applauded by Jon Lansman, the chair of pro-Corbyn campaign group Momentum. ""We are a pluralist party ... I welcome that."" This video can not be played Jon Ashworth: ""We need to be throwing these people out of Labour."" While the intention is to unify, the BBC's political correspondent Alex Forsyth said one MP warned if there was a hostile response from the party leadership, it could lead to further splits. Mr Corbyn has called on the nine who quit Labour to stand down and seek re-election as independent MPs. This video can not be played Tom Watson: ""I know that he (Jeremy Corbyn) will... share my horror"" Shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry has said those who resigned from her party had ""betrayed"" their seats and would be ""crushed"" if by-elections were held. Speaking on Saturday at a Labour rally inNottinghamshire, she said she would rather die than join a new party. In response, Mr Watson told the BBC's Andrew Marr show that he thought ""dying is a virtue that is over-rated"" and said it was ""incumbent on all of us to dial down the rhetoric"".

"Primary and secondary pupils in England will learn about relationships, keeping safe online and looking after their mental health as part of compulsory lessons from September next year. Children in primary schools will have relationships education and this will be broadened to relationships and sex education in secondary schools. Health education for all ages will also be part of the curriculum in England. Parents will still have the right to withdraw their child up to age 15. However, head teachers are expected to talk to parents who wish to exclude their child from these lessons, ""discussing with the parents the benefits of receiving this important education and any detrimental effects that withdrawal might have on the child"". Under new compulsory health education lessons, primary children will be taught about how to look after their own mental wellbeing and also to recognise when their classmates might be struggling. They will cover why simple self-care, such as getting enough sleep and spending time outdoors and with friends, is important. Teaching about the excessive use of electronic devices and limiting time spent online is also included. In terms of relationships education, primary children will also be taught age-appropriate online safety - including what to do if they come across things they are uncomfortable with, the importance of respect for others even when posting anonymously and the risks of talking to people on the internet who they don't know in real life. Secondary-age pupils will also have health education, focusing on mental health. The curriculum will aim to ensure that young people can spot the signs of common mental illnesses, such as anxiety and depression in themselves or others. They will learn how to discuss their emotions accurately and sensitively and how to access professional help. They will also cover the impact of alcohol and drugs on physical and mental health. Parents protest over LGBT rights teaching 'Teach kids about same-sex couples' Period health to be taught in English schools Children to be taught about FGM harm 'Get up and out': Helping teenagers beat the blues Young mums: Sex ed 'must cover respect' In terms of sex and relationships, lessons will cover online safety topics, including the serious risks of sharing private photos, the impact of viewing explicit or harmful content - including how to report it and receive support. Lessons will cover how the internet can promote an unhealthy view of sex and relationships. The guidance says that pupils need to understand ""that some people are LGBT [lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender], that this should be respected in British society, and that the law affords them and their relationships recognition and protections"". The guidance adds: ""Schools should make decisions about what it is appropriate to teach on this subject and when, based on the age, development and religious backgrounds of their pupils, and should involve their parents in these decisions."" Secondary-age pupils will also be taught about female genital mutilation (FGM) - focusing on awareness, the availability of support networks and reminding them that it is illegal. Online safety will be covered The government says they should also be taught about other forms of honour-based abuse, as well as grooming, forced marriage and domestic abuse. Schools will decide how frequently to hold age-appropriate lessons. Thenew guidance,externalfollows an extensive call for evidence and a three-month consultation, which received more than 11,000 responses. There are certainly groups who have concerns about what issues are covered in RSE and who feel some topics should not be taught by schools. The Parent Power advice website says parents should be able to educate children in line with their own religious faith. Linda Rose, from the group, says she is not convinced by promises that teaching will be age appropriate. ""Children are given too much information too young and don't have the emotional maturity to process all this information,"" she says. ""We are worried that this isn't upholding religion as a protected characteristic with equal value to the other protected characteristics."" Recently, a group ofMuslim parents in Birmingham protestedover their children being taught about LGBT rights and homophobia. Also,a petition calling for parents to have the right to opt their child out of sex education lessons,externalhas attracted more than 106,000 signatures. It says: ""We believe it is the parent's fundamental right to teach their child RSE topics or to at least decide who teaches them and when and how they are taught. ""We want the right to opt our children out of RSE when it becomes mandatory in Sept 2020. ""We have grave concerns about the physical, psychological and spiritual implications of teaching children about certain sexual and relational concepts proposed in RSE and believe that they have no place within a mandatory school curriculum."" Speaking in the House of Commons on Monday, Education Secretary Damian Hinds said  Â£6m would be made available in 2019/20 to cover training and resources. Mr Hinds said: ""Growing up and adolescence are hard enough, but the internet and social media add new pressures that just weren't there even one generation ago. ""Almost 20 years on from the last time guidance on sex education was updated, there is a lot to catch up on."" Mr Hinds says new guidance is needed to reflect a changed world Mr Hinds adds that it is ""appropriate"" to make health education universal alongside relationships and sex education. ""It will help children learn how to look after themselves, physically and mentally, and the importance of getting away from the screen and the headphones. ""And it can help young people be resilient as they chart a course through an ever more complex world."" Charities have been generally positive about the government's new guidelines. The NSPCC said the guidance would help children ""navigate the modern world"". Head of policy, Almudena Lara, said: ""The NSPCC firmly believes that every child should be taught from an early age about consent, different relationships, and what abuse and harassment is, so that they learn they have the right to be treated with dignity and respect. ""Teachers must receive high-quality training and support to deliver the new curriculum, so that every school across the country meets the same high standards."" The Catholic Education Service said it  welcomed the government's announcement. Director Paul Barber said:  ""Catholic education is centred on the formation of the whole child and age-appropriate RSE is an essential part of this. ""It is essential for creating well-rounded young people, for equipping students to make good life choices and for keeping our children safe."" Anna Feuchtwang, chief executive of campaign group the National Children's Bureau, said the guidance was ""a welcome step forward in preparing children for adulthood, improving their well-being and keeping them safe and healthy"".

"Instagram is owned by Facebook Victims aged in their 20s have each lost an average of Â£8,900 after falling for investment scams that appear on image-sharing platform Instagram. Action Fraud, a UK police-led awareness centre, said there had been a surge in activity in recent months by fraudsters posting about get-rich-quick schemes. Victims are promised high returns within 24 hours, but the fraudsters demand fees and then disappear. Some 356 reports of losses have been made in the past five months. Those tricked lost a collective total of more than Â£3m, but more is expected to have been stolen as some victims may not have reported their losses. Reports of frauds on the elderly are 'tip of iceberg' Instagram scam preys on bank followers The scam sees schemes advertised via the Instagram app. Those targeted are encouraged to transfer Â£600 and are promised almost instantaneous profits. Once the money is paid, they are sent images supposedly of profits building up in their accounts. The fraudsters tell their victims to ""invest"" more, and that the money can be released for a fee, which is why losses can build to thousands of pounds. However, they then they close the Instagram account, stop all contact, and disappear with the money. Investment fraudsters often use professional-looking images and may promise free research reports, special discounts and ""secret"" stock tips. ZeroFox, a security company specialising in social media,previously told the BBCthat it found more than two million public Instagram posts that push these types of scam, known as money-flipping. Inspector Paul Carroll, of Action Fraud, said: ""Opportunistic fraudsters are taking advantage of unsuspecting victims who are going about their day-to-day lives on social media."" He urged social media users never to send money to strangers only encountered online, to check financial matters with family members, to only deal with financial firms authorised by the regulator - the Financial Conduct Authority - and to report any cases of fraud.

"This video can not be played Why is it difficult to know exactly how many people sleep rough? Deaths of homeless people were nine times higher in deprived areas of England than in the least disadvantaged areas, analysis of data has shown. There were an estimated 21 deaths in Manchester, 18 in Birmingham, 17 each in Bristol, Lambeth and Liverpool and 15 in Camden in 2017. About 2,627 homeless people died in England and Wales from 2013 to 2017. Deaths were recorded in 156 local authority areas in 2017, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. When weighted by population, the 11 deaths estimated in Blackburn with Darwen gave the area the highest rate. Housing charity Shelter said the figures were a ""wake-up call"". Chief executive Polly Neate said: ""There is nothing inevitable about people dying homeless, it is a direct consequence of a broken housing system."" Jon Sparkes, chief executive of Crisis, said councils needed ""appropriate funding to conduct reviews into the death of every person who has died while homeless, to prevent more people from dying needlessly"". The breakdownfollowed the release of figures for England and Wales in December, with an estimate of 574 homeless deaths in urban areas in 2017, compared with 26 in rural areas. Analysis of confirmed deaths in England over five years,externalshowed almost a quarter were in the 10% of areas officially ranked as the most deprived. The ONS said: ""The rate of deaths per 100,000 population in the most deprived tenth of local areas in England was 9.2 times that of the least deprived tenth. ""For Wales, the rate of deaths per 100,000 population in the most deprived tenth of local areas was 3.4 times that of the least deprived tenth."" The ONS included people sleeping rough or using emergency accommodation, such as homeless shelters and hostels, at or around the time of death. 'Art helped lift me out of homelessness' Talk to homeless, says killed man's sister Reality Check: Who is homeless? Ben Humberstone, head of health analysis for the ONS, said: ""The figures show that the deprivation level of an area has a real impact. Many more people die homeless in the most deprived areas of England and Wales and 95% of the deaths are in urban areas rather than rural areas."" Sayyed Osman, Blackburn with Darwen Council's director of adults and prevention, said: ""The issues here are complex and made worse by the fact we have a disproportionate amount of hostels which people from out of our borough are coming to use which in turn puts further pressure on limited resource and services. ""These are major issues affecting towns and cities across the country and there are no quick or easy solutions and this is certainly not something that the council can deal with in isolation."" The number of people counted or estimated to be sleeping rough in Englandfell slightly in 2018 for the first time in eight years. The government said it was investing Â£1.2bn to tackle homelessness. Communities secretary James Brokenshire said: ""Councils have used this funding to create an additional 1,750 beds and 500 rough sleeping support staff - and figures published last month show this investment is already starting to have an effect. ""I am also committed to ensuring independent reviews into the deaths of rough sleepers are conducted, where appropriate, so that important lessons are learned - and I will be holding local authorities to account in doing just that.""

"The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have visited one of Morocco's most prestigious equestrian clubs on the final day of their tour of the country. The couple visited the Royal Moroccan Equestrian Club Dar Essalam in Rabat to see how horses and ponies were used to support children with special needs. The royals also visited a market and ate traditional food made by underprivileged children. The three-day trip is aimed at strengthening UK links to the country. During the visit to the club, the couple spoke to youngsters who had been helped by equine-assisted therapy. The therapy involves people interacting with horses by, for example, grooming and feeding them. Research has suggested this can improve people's self-confidence and independence and help with mental health issues. In Britain, the therapy has been used to helpreturning soldiers,domestic abuse victimsand people facingmental healthand social problems. Ekram, 20, who has Down's Syndrome and began riding at the club a month ago, told the couple: ""I love the connection with the horses, it already makes me feel relaxed and more confident. And I like being outside, with nature."" Meghan replied: ""Wow, you're very impressive. What an accomplished lady. I imagine it's so therapeutic as well as meditative."" The couple were pictured as they stopped to stroke horses at the club stables. Prince Harry and Meghan, who is pregnant, later joined a pony-grooming session. Spotting one pony shaking, Prince Harry joked: ""Has anyone got any carrots? She's a bit nervous, this one."" Meghan, who made her name as an actress, said: ""Well, we all get a little camera shy, I understand."" The programme is funded by Morocco's King Mohammed VI, who Harry and Meghan are staying with at his royal residence. Harry and Meghan arrive in Morocco Horses helping domestic abuse victims Harry and Meghan visit Morocco girls' school During their visit, the couple also ate food prepared by children from disadvantaged backgrounds with help from one of Morocco's foremost chefs, Moha Fedal. Among the food they made were Moroccan pancakes which feature in a cookbook that Meghan was influential in getting published. The book, called Together: Our Community Cookbook, waspublished after the duchess suggested the idea to a group of womenwho got together to cook food for those affected by the Grenfell Tower fire tragedy, which killed 72 people in west London June 2017. It became a bestseller and is helping to fund the women's Hubb Community Kitchen - named after the Arabic word for love. The couple arrived in Morocco on Saturday evening after a two-hour delay to their flight into Casablanca. On Sunday, they met young women in Morocco to show support for girls' education. They couple were welcomed to a boarding house in the village of Asni by the girls, who waved flags and sang songs. During the visit, the duchess was given a traditional Moroccan henna tattoo, which is intended to bring luck to her first child. The north Africa visit is the royal couple's second official tour as a married couplefollowing a 16-day royal trip around Australia, Tonga, Fiji and New Zealandlast year.

"The sun is out in Folkestone, Kent The UK is experiencing its warmest February day on record, with the Met Office reporting a temperature of 20.6C (69.08F) at Trawsgoed, Ceredigion. It is the first time a temperature of over 20C has been recorded in winter. It breaks the UK's record for February, set when the temperature reached 19.7C  in Greenwich in 1998. A new English record has also been set with temperatures rising to 20.1C in Hampton Water Works, in south-west London. It is the second day running the Welsh record has been broken. On Sunday, temperatures reached 19.1C, breaking the record of 18.6C (65.48F) set 29 years ago in the south Wales village of Velindre. The BBC Weather Centre says Tuesday's weather conditions are likely to be very similar. It says to expect a largely sunny, but chilly, start with frost in places. The rest of the day will become increasingly warm with lengthy spells of sunshine, threatening February temperature records once again. The warmest areas are likely to be around the London area and across north and west Wales again. By Nick Miller, BBC Weather It's hard to believe that a year ago Britain was about to endure the worst of the so-called Beast from the East, with widespread snow and sub-zero temperatures. Fast forward 12 months and this record February warmth shows just how varied the UK weather can be. The reason temperatures have been so high is the direction our air is coming from. High pressure parked to the south east of the British Isles has been dragging warm air from Africa and the Canary Islands our way. Temperatures are further boosted bysomething known as the foehn effect, when air warms as it flows down the lee side of mountains. All of this combined with the sunshine has produced something quite remarkable for February. Caroline Lucas, the former leader of the Green Party, suggested the warm weather is linked to climate change. She said: ""I like spending an afternoon in the sunshine as much as anyone, but it's impossible to shake the feeling that this isn't right."" Tom Burke, of the independent climate change think tank E3G, said extreme warm weather events were exactly what climate change experts said would happen if people continued to put carbon into the atmosphere. With new records for temperature being set, and everyone seemingly dazzled by the unexpected heat, the obvious question is whether climate change has a role? The usual answer is that no single heatwave, storm or flood can be directly connected to global warming, and that's what the Met Office is saying now. ""We've had the warmest day of winter on record,"" says spokesman Grahame Madge, ""and it does fit a pattern of warming. ""But it would be simplistic to link this to climate change until a study has been carried out."" Previous research has shown how the odds of particular weather events - like last summer's heatwave - have been made more likely because of the increasing levels of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases heating up the atmosphere. And the projections for future global warming are clear that the kind of weather that feels strange now will appear normal in the decades ahead, as the underlying global average temperature rises. Met Office analysis of temperatures shows that British winters have become slightly milder over the past half century, a trend that's set to continue. The record UK temperature for a February day was broken in five different locations on Monday: Trawsgoed, Dyfed 20.6C Northolt, west London 20.4C Gogerddan, Dyfed 20.1C Bala, Gwynedd 20.0C Wisley, Surrey 19.9C Lewis Parfitt captured this snow covered pond in Christchurch park in Suffolk a year ago It was a totally different scene at the pond this February Pauline Daniels took this image during the ""Beast from the East"" in Suffolk in February 2018 This year Pauline captured clear blue skies and sunshine Last year, when RenÃ©e Lloyd took this image, the streets outside the Jamaican High Commission in London were covered in snow RenÃ©e thinks the Jamaican flag looks better when it's bathed in sunshine against a bright blue sky Are you enjoying the weather? 7 of the world's most extreme weather conditions Darren Tansley, a mammal ecologist at Essex Wildlife Trust, said the unseasonably warm weather could have a detrimental effect on hibernating species, such as dormice, hedgehogs and bats. He said: ""They could be coming out of hibernation too early, which means they're active at a time when really they should be reserving their body fat to get over the slack food period."" He also said these species could be looking for food that was not abundant at this time of year. Is it sunny where you are?

"Howard X says officials have told him that his visa is ""invalid"", but has received no explanation as to why A Kim Jong-un impersonator has been deported from Vietnam ahead of the real North Korean leader'smeeting with US President Trump in Hanoi this week. Hong Kong resident Howard X staged a fake summit with Trump impersonator Russell White last week. The two were later held for questioning by Vietnamese policeand told to cease all their political jesting. Howard X says officials have since told him his visa is ""invalid"", but says he has received no further explanation. ""Satire is a powerful weapon against any dictatorship. They are scared of a couple of guys that look like the real thing,"" Howard X, who was wearing a black suit and thick black glasses in the style of Kim Jong-un, told reporters. He and Mr White took part in a faux summit in Vietnam's capital, Hanoi, telling reporters they intended to scale down North Korea's nuclear ambitions. Allow Facebook content?

Through negotiations, with dialogue, we want to help North Korea of course,"" Canada-born Mr White told reporters at the time, dressed as Donald Trump. ""Hopefully he can overlook all my nuclear missiles and lift the sanctions,"" answered Howard X, a full-time impressionist who visited Singapore ahead of the first US-North Korea summit last year. The men were later detained by police whilst giving an interview to a local TV station. Vietnamese police told the pair to stop their impersonations and said they could only travel around the city with an approved itinerary and escort, AFP news agency reports. ""The real reason is I was born with a face looking like Kim Jong-un, that's the real crime,"" said Howard X. This video can not be played Howard and a Donald Trump impersonator go hand in hand in Singapore He added he believed he was being deported because the North Korean leader had ""no sense of humour"". The Kim lookalike took part in similar satirical stunts during the first US-North Korea summit in Singapore last year. He was also escorted away by security at the 2018 Winter Olympics in South Korea after dancing in front of North Korea's cheerleading squad. President Trump and Kim Jong-un are due to meet in Hanoi on 27-28 February for talks expected to focus on persuading North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons programme. Their first summit in Singapore last June generated significant coverage and optimism, but delivered very few concrete developments. Both sides said they were committed to denuclearisation, but gave no details of how this would be carried out or verified.

"It will be compulsory to teach about periods at schools in England by 2020, which endometriosis sufferer Alice Smith calls ""massive"". The 23-year-old was diagnosed with the chronic condition at 14 and has been campaigning for menstrual health to be on the school curriculum. Alice says the new guidelines mean girls will know ""from a much younger age what is normal"" and what isn't when it comes to their periods. Consent is also to be taught at school. And children will learn about domestic violence, relationships and staying safe online. ""My experience at school would be very different now,"" Alice says. Endometriosis, which affects one in 10 women in the UK, is where tissue similar to the lining of the womb grows elsewhere in a woman's body. It causes chronic pain, fatigue, bowel and bladder problems, and can lead to infertility. Children to be taught about FGM harm Alice says endometriosis kept her out of school Alice first started having symptoms when she was 12, and was diagnosed with endometriosis two years later. ""For any other illness that would be a long time but unfortunately that's a really quick diagnosis for endometriosis,"" she says. She says being in hospital on morphine every two weeks, whenever she ovulated and had her period, is the reason it was picked up early. But things didn't get any easier after the diagnosis. ""I went home and googled it and my world fell apart really. ""Reading that it was life-long and there's no cure, and we don't know what causes it. I was reading blogs by women who'd lost their jobs and their marriages had broken down because of it and they didn't have kids and they were suicidal. ""It felt like a death sentence."" Alice says she would have gone to a doctor sooner if she'd been taught about endometriosis Alice calls it her ""mission"" to make sure young girls being diagnosed with the condition now don't have to feel like that. ""It really isn't the end of the world, it can get better and you should never ever give up with different doctors or trying different things."" And she says periods being taught in school, to boys as well as girls, is a step towards that. ""That generation will have language in their vocabulary that we never had. ""They'll know how to describe things that we never did and they'll be talking about periods in school and the biology of it, and the science behind it, and endometriosis will be mentioned in the classroom,"" she says. This diagram shows endometriosis built up around the fallopian tubes and ovaries Sex education has been compulsory in England since 2017, but there has been a public consultation about what should be on the curriculum. All pupils will now learn about menstrual health and the menstrual cycle starting in primary school. Pupils will also learn about relationships, starting in primary school, and relationships and sex, starting in secondary school. The curriculum will also be LGBT inclusive. Alice says all she remembers learning about periods is watching a nurse put a tampon into a glass of water to show it expanding. ""We were all sort of crossing our legs,"" she says. She thinks that the new guidelines will create an ""open"" environment for kids to learn what is and isn't normal. ""I probably would have gone to the doctor sooner and pushed harder because I wouldn't have put up with such horrific periods just thinking that they were normal. ""Education plays a really important role in teaching young women how to talk about when their bodies aren't functioning properly."" For Alice, there will ""always be more"" campaigning to do on endometriosis, but she says we're ""heading in the right direction"" for more research to find out what causes it and find a cure. On a personal level she says her body is ""irreparably damaged"" from endometriosis. ""I had it on my bowels, my bladder, and certain ligaments and so I've got chronic inflammation, and there's no cure for that - those organs don't really properly work."" She says she's in pain every single day and has just finished her second round of egg freezing because her fertility is low. ""The dream for me was to finish school, to go to university away from home, and also to get to a level where if you were to look at me and you were to know me, you wouldn't know I was ill unless I told you."" And she says while it's been a long road and there will be a life of managing the condition: ""I'm at that place now."" Sex education guidance is currently open for consultation in Wales, while in Northern Ireland the Department of Education requires each school to have its own written policy on how it will address the delivery of relationship and sex education. In Scotland, guidance on sex education was introduced in 2014 - although the curriculum is non-statutory and decisions about which topics are included in the curriculum is a matter for schools and local authorities to decide.

"President Donald Trump has said that the US and China are ""very very close"" to signing a trade agreement, potentially ending the long-running feud between the two countries. Mr Trump told US governors on Monday that both nations ""are going to have a signing summit"". ""Hopefully, we can get that completed. But we're getting very, very close,"" he said. It follows a decision to delay imposing further trade tariffs on Chinese goods. A quick guide to the US-China trade war Three things the US and China will never agree on What is a trade war? At the weekend, Mr Trump said both sides had made ""substantial progress"" in trade talks following a summit in Washington last week. The rise in import duties on Chinese goods from 10% to 25% was due to come into effect on 1 March. Instead, Mr Trump said the US is now planning a summit with Chinese Premier Xi Jinping at the US President's Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. US shares rose on the decision to delay tariffs, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average closing 0.23% higher at 26,091.9. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq also finished trading in positive territory. As he prepared to meet North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in Vietnam, Mr Trump also tweeted that a China trade deal was in ""advanced stages"". Allow Twitter content?

Mr Trump's decision to delay tariff increases on $200bn (Â£153bn) worth of Chinese goods was seen as a sign that the two sides were moving ahead in settling their damaging trade war. Last week, Mr Trump noted progress in the latest round of negotiations in Washington, including an agreement on currency manipulation, though no details were disclosed. Sources toldCNBC,externalon Friday that China had committed to buying up to $1.2 trillion in US goods, but there had been no progress on the intellectual property issues. President Trump met China's Vice Premier Liu He on Friday Gregory Daco, chief US economist at Oxford Economics, said: ""We had anticipated such a delay and believe a handshake agreement in which China will promise to import more agricultural products, work towards a stable currency and reinforce intellectual property rights protection will be achieved in the coming weeks. ""However, we don't foresee a significant rollback of existing tariffs, and see underlying tensions regarding China's strategic ambitions, its industrial policy, technological transfers and 'verification and enforcement' mechanisms remaining in place."" Mr Trump initiated the trade war over complaints of unfair Chinese trading practices. That included accusing China of stealing intellectual property from American firms, forcing them to transfer technology to China. The US has imposed tariffs on $250bn worth of Chinese goods, and China has retaliated by imposing duties on $110bn of US products. Mr Trump has also threatened further tariffs on an additional $267bn worth of Chinese products - which would see virtually all of Chinese imports into the US become subject to duties. The trade dispute has unnerved financial markets, risks raising costs for American companies and is adding pressure to aChinese economy that is already showing signs of strain. It has also stoked fears about the impact on the global economy. Last year, the International Monetary Fund warned the trade war between the US and China riskedmaking the world a ""poorer and more dangerous place"".

"This video can not be played Watch: Serena Williams calls umpire 'liar' and 'thief' A controversial cartoon of Serena Williams published in an Australian newspaper last year did not breach media standards, a press watchdog says. The cartoon depicted Williams jumping above a broken racquetnext to a baby's dummy in the US Open final. Critics complained that the caricature used racist and sexist stereotypes of African-American people. The Australian Press Council noted that some had found the image ""offensive"", but accepted the publisher's defence. Williams sparked controversy during her loss to Naomi Osakain September for her on-court behaviour where she accused the umpire of sexism and being a ""thief"". The Herald Sun newspaper and cartoonist Mark Knight have consistently called their depiction a comment on Williams's behaviour, denying it was racist or sexist. Allow Twitter content?

The press watchdog said the newspaper had ""sufficient public interest in commenting on behaviour and sportsmanship"". The cartoon went viral in September, drawing criticism globally. The National Association of Black Journalists in the US denounced it as ""repugnant on many levels"". Public complaints centred around the portrayal of Williams with ""large lips, a broad flat nose... and [being] positioned in an ape-like pose"", said the watchdog. What cartoonists think about the Serena caricature Serena Williams and 'angry black women' This contrasted with the depiction of Osaka, whose father is Haitian and mother Japanese, ""as white with blonde hair"". However, the watchdog ruled that the cartoon did ""not depict Ms Williams as an ape, rather showing her as 'spitting the dummy', a non-racist caricature familiar to most Australian readers"". Spitting the dummy is an Australian colloquialism for someone who reacts to a situation in a bad-tempered or petulant manner. Knight told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation he was ""very happy"" about the watchdog's ruling. The Australian Press Council is the chief watchdog for complaints about Australian media, but does not have the power to issue or enforce penalties.

"Instagram is owned by Facebook Victims aged in their 20s have each lost an average of Â£8,900 after falling for investment scams that appear on image-sharing platform Instagram. Action Fraud, a UK police-led awareness centre, said there had been a surge in activity in recent months by fraudsters posting about get-rich-quick schemes. Victims are promised high returns within 24 hours, but the fraudsters demand fees and then disappear. Some 356 reports of losses have been made in the past five months. Those tricked lost a collective total of more than Â£3m, but more is expected to have been stolen as some victims may not have reported their losses. Reports of frauds on the elderly are 'tip of iceberg' Instagram scam preys on bank followers The scam sees schemes advertised via the Instagram app. Those targeted are encouraged to transfer Â£600 and are promised almost instantaneous profits. Once the money is paid, they are sent images supposedly of profits building up in their accounts. The fraudsters tell their victims to ""invest"" more, and that the money can be released for a fee, which is why losses can build to thousands of pounds. However, they then they close the Instagram account, stop all contact, and disappear with the money. Investment fraudsters often use professional-looking images and may promise free research reports, special discounts and ""secret"" stock tips. ZeroFox, a security company specialising in social media,previously told the BBCthat it found more than two million public Instagram posts that push these types of scam, known as money-flipping. Inspector Paul Carroll, of Action Fraud, said: ""Opportunistic fraudsters are taking advantage of unsuspecting victims who are going about their day-to-day lives on social media."" He urged social media users never to send money to strangers only encountered online, to check financial matters with family members, to only deal with financial firms authorised by the regulator - the Financial Conduct Authority - and to report any cases of fraud.

"Some adverts could remain after 25 February as advertisers have booked space for long periods, but TfL said they will be replaced or removed as soon as possible A ban on junk food advertising across London's entire public transport network has come into force. Posters for food and drink high in fat, salt and sugar will begin to be removed from theUnderground, Overground, buses and bus sheltersfrom Monday. Some adverts for unhealthy products could remain on the network for a while as some companies have booked advertising space for long periods. All future bookings are subject to the new policy, Transport for London said. ""We've already seen large advertisers confirm they will continue to advertise on the TfL network under the new rules - by advertising their products that are not too high in fat, salt and sugar,"" TfL said. London Mayor Sadiq Khan said he wanted to tackle the ""ticking time bomb"" of child obesity in the capital. However, the Advertising Association said the ban would have ""little impact on the wider societal issues that drive obesity"". Allow Twitter content?

"The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have visited one of Morocco's most prestigious equestrian clubs on the final day of their tour of the country. The couple visited the Royal Moroccan Equestrian Club Dar Essalam in Rabat to see how horses and ponies were used to support children with special needs. The royals also visited a market and ate traditional food made by underprivileged children. The three-day trip is aimed at strengthening UK links to the country. During the visit to the club, the couple spoke to youngsters who had been helped by equine-assisted therapy. The therapy involves people interacting with horses by, for example, grooming and feeding them. Research has suggested this can improve people's self-confidence and independence and help with mental health issues. In Britain, the therapy has been used to helpreturning soldiers,domestic abuse victimsand people facingmental healthand social problems. Ekram, 20, who has Down's Syndrome and began riding at the club a month ago, told the couple: ""I love the connection with the horses, it already makes me feel relaxed and more confident. And I like being outside, with nature."" Meghan replied: ""Wow, you're very impressive. What an accomplished lady. I imagine it's so therapeutic as well as meditative."" The couple were pictured as they stopped to stroke horses at the club stables. Prince Harry and Meghan, who is pregnant, later joined a pony-grooming session. Spotting one pony shaking, Prince Harry joked: ""Has anyone got any carrots? She's a bit nervous, this one."" Meghan, who made her name as an actress, said: ""Well, we all get a little camera shy, I understand."" The programme is funded by Morocco's King Mohammed VI, who Harry and Meghan are staying with at his royal residence. Harry and Meghan arrive in Morocco Horses helping domestic abuse victims Harry and Meghan visit Morocco girls' school During their visit, the couple also ate food prepared by children from disadvantaged backgrounds with help from one of Morocco's foremost chefs, Moha Fedal. Among the food they made were Moroccan pancakes which feature in a cookbook that Meghan was influential in getting published. The book, called Together: Our Community Cookbook, waspublished after the duchess suggested the idea to a group of womenwho got together to cook food for those affected by the Grenfell Tower fire tragedy, which killed 72 people in west London June 2017. It became a bestseller and is helping to fund the women's Hubb Community Kitchen - named after the Arabic word for love. The couple arrived in Morocco on Saturday evening after a two-hour delay to their flight into Casablanca. On Sunday, they met young women in Morocco to show support for girls' education. They couple were welcomed to a boarding house in the village of Asni by the girls, who waved flags and sang songs. During the visit, the duchess was given a traditional Moroccan henna tattoo, which is intended to bring luck to her first child.

"Howard X says officials have told him that his visa is ""invalid"", but has received no explanation as to why A Kim Jong-un impersonator has been deported from Vietnam ahead of the real North Korean leader'smeeting with US President Trump in Hanoi this week. Hong Kong resident Howard X staged a fake summit with Trump impersonator Russell White last week. The two were later held for questioning by Vietnamese policeand told to cease all their political jesting. Howard X says officials have since told him his visa is ""invalid"", but says he has received no further explanation. ""Satire is a powerful weapon against any dictatorship. They are scared of a couple of guys that look like the real thing,"" Howard X, who was wearing a black suit and thick black glasses in the style of Kim Jong-un, told reporters. He and Mr White took part in a faux summit in Vietnam's capital, Hanoi, telling reporters they intended to scale down North Korea's nuclear ambitions. Allow Facebook content?

""Hopefully he can overlook all my nuclear missiles and lift the sanctions,"" answered Howard X, a full-time impressionist who visited Singapore ahead of the first US-North Korea summit last year. The men were later detained by police whilst giving an interview to a local TV station. Vietnamese police told the pair to stop their impersonations and said they could only travel around the city with an approved itinerary and escort, AFP news agency reports. ""The real reason is I was born with a face looking like Kim Jong-un, that's the real crime,"" said Howard X.

"One of the last elephant sanctuaries in Africa has ""a significant elephant-poaching problem"", according to the final results of an aerial wildlife survey in Botswana seen by the BBC. Elephants Without Borders, which conducted the four-yearly survey with the government, said there was a six-fold increase in the number of ""fresh"" or ""recent"" elephant carcasses in northern Botswana amid ""obvious signs"" of poaching. Mike Chase, the scientist who carried out the survey, sparked a fierce debate in the country when he wentpublic half-way through his study in August last yearwith accusations there was a poaching problem and alleging the authorities were ignoring him. This video can not be played Dozens of dead elephants have been discovered in poaching hot spots in Botswana, Africa He told the BBC at the time that while flying over northern Botswana, he had discovered 87 recently killed elephants in one ""hotspot"" area - a number now revised to 88 - and 128 overall. The government called his figures ""false and misleading"" and criticised ""unsubstantiated and sensational media reports"". He received death threats and has since had one of his two research licences suspended by the government. President Mokgweetsi Masisi at the time described the allegations as the ""biggest hoax of the 21st Century"" and denied there had been a spike in poaching in the country. But the final report identifies four poaching hotspots, provides photographic evidence from ground surveys and has been peer-reviewed by nine international elephant experts. ""The response fromâ¦ various people was to try and deny or whitewash - label me a traitor and a liar - without having actually verified the evidence we bore witness to,"" said Mr Chase. Mike Chase said he found a six-fold increase in the number of ""fresh"" carcasses in northern Botswana The government didn't respond to the BBC's request for an interview about the final report, but issued a statement criticising the methods used in carrying out the survey. The statement from Thato Raphaka, permanent secretary of the Ministry of Environment, Natural Resources Conservation and Tourism, said it was ""regrettable"" the report showed an ""astonishing number of pictures of dead elephants"". It was critical of some of the scientific details in the report and requested the raw data to be submitted to the elephant specialist group at the International Union for Conservation of Nature for further independent review. Otisitwe Tiroyamodimo, the director of the Department of Wildlife and National Parks, said the government acknowledged there was a poaching problem. ""Nobody can deny that elephants are being killed in Botswana,"" but those reported by Mr Chase had mainly died ""from natural causes and retaliatory killings."" ""We went there and we couldn't find the 87 carcasses,"" said Mr Tiroyamodimo. The authorities flew with Mr Chase but admit they spent only two days trying to verify carcasses seen over two months. The BBC was given permission by the government to have access to the coordinates of one of the four areas identified as a ""poaching hotspot"" by the research team, and we visited the sites of 67 elephant carcasses. A few had apparently died of natural causes, but most had the characteristics associated with being poached: tusks were missing and branches had been used to cover the bodies to prevent them being found. But Botswana is home to 130,000 elephants - a third of the total number in Africa - and it is an obvious target for poachers. Even when extrapolating poaching figures from the sample found in the survey, the numbers killed will not have a major impact on such a large population. ""If we are talking about a number of carcasses that have accumulated over a period of two years, given the population of elephants in Botswana it doesn't really raise eyebrows,"" said national parks director Mr Tiroyamodimo. This was not satisfactory for Mr Chase. ""At what point do we say we have a problem?"" he asked. ""Is it at 10? 50? 100? 150? 1,000? Lessons have taught us - when we look at Tanzania that lost 60% of its elephant population in five years - that's how quickly poaching can settle into a population. ""We saw with our own eyes 157 confirmed poached elephants. We estimate that the total poached in the last year is at least 385 and probably far more because that is based on what we actually saw and have not had time or finances to visit all carcasses on the ground."" But the storm over the reported spike in poaching appears to have more to do with Botswana's bitter and complicated new politics than its wildlife. President Masisi was vice-president until April 2018, when then-President Ian Khama handed power over to his deputy. Since then the two men have fallen out. The new president has his own vision on a number of issues, among them conservation, and has reversed some of the previous policies. Hunting was banned under President Khama and Botswana was known for a zero-tolerance approach to poachers. It was reported that in 2015 alone 30 Namibians, 22 Zimbabweans and an unknown number of Zambians were shot on suspicion of poaching. Elephants can be very destructive when they encroach on to farmland and move though villages - destroying crops and sometimes killing people. Many rural communities believe the number of elephants is increasing, even though there is no evidence of this from scientific surveys. But their ""range"" - how far the elephants travel - is expanding for a number of different reasons and that is increasing conflict between wildlife and humans. Many people believe this worsened after hunting was banned in 2013, and want it to be re-introduced. The government has to balance lifting the hunting ban to win votes against the impact it may have on Botswana's international reputation as a luxury safari destination. 'Elephant refugee' problem in Africa The country that brought its elephants back from the brink The war on elephants President Masisi removed ""weapons of war"" from the national parks' small anti-poaching unit, saying they were illegal for non-military officers. A consultation he initiated has justrecommended that the hunting ban be lifted and that elephants be culled and their meat canned for pet food. Thirteen rhinos have also been killed by poachers in the last year Botswana is also now backing regional efforts to lift a ban on the ivory trade. The two men are locked in a political feud ahead of a party congress which will choose a new leader, with national elections due later in the year. Mr Chase has a close relationship with the former president, so the timing of his allegations has been seen by some as a political attack on the new president - even if the final report provides evidence that poaching was going on before Mr Masisi took office. Botswana attracts high-end tourists from across the world because of its international reputation for successful conservation. But with the continuing political storm - and a dependency on government permits to run high-end safaris - few of the big safari operators would comment on how big a problem poaching has become. Thirteen rhinos have been killed by poachers in the last 12 months - an unprecedented number.

""I think the government has been hiding it for a while, and now that it's been brought out into the open, we're now realising how serious the problem is, and these big poachers have actually infiltrated further than we expected them to be."" Kim Nixon from Wilderness Safaris says all cases of poaching are reported Wilderness Safaris operates luxury lodges in one of the concessions where some of the 88 carcasses were found. Its chief executive Kim Nixon rejected any suggestion there was a denial of the problem. ""Whenever poaching has occurred in any of our concession areas, each and every incident has been reported as a criminal case,"" he said. ""We're not in any way mandated or allowed to do any anti-poaching - our role at best is monitoring."" Mr Chase says ""don't shoot the messenger"" adding: ""I think it requires all stakeholders working together - government, private, public sectors, the NGOs."" Botswana is still the safest place in the world to be a rhino or an elephant, but with a continuing demand for ivory in Asia, it is now firmly in the poachers' sights.

"Some adverts could remain after 25 February as advertisers have booked space for long periods, but TfL said they will be replaced or removed as soon as possible A ban on junk food advertising across London's entire public transport network has come into force. Posters for food and drink high in fat, salt and sugar will begin to be removed from theUnderground, Overground, buses and bus sheltersfrom Monday. Some adverts for unhealthy products could remain on the network for a while as some companies have booked advertising space for long periods. All future bookings are subject to the new policy, Transport for London said. ""We've already seen large advertisers confirm they will continue to advertise on the TfL network under the new rules - by advertising their products that are not too high in fat, salt and sugar,"" TfL said. London Mayor Sadiq Khan said he wanted to tackle the ""ticking time bomb"" of child obesity in the capital. However, the Advertising Association said the ban would have ""little impact on the wider societal issues that drive obesity"". Allow Twitter content?

"Siblings Michelle Sealey and Paul Anthony Bridgewater say they have become ""like a family"" with others who lost loved ones in the bombings A brother and sister whose father was among the victims of the Birmingham pub bombings say they are hoping for ""the truth"" from the resumed inquests. Two bombs ripped through the Mulberry Bush and Tavern in the Town pubs on 21 November 1974, killing 21 and injuring 220. A jury was sworn in earlier as the inquests reopened after a long fight by families. Paul Anthony Bridgewater and Michelle Sealey are among relatives attending. Mr Bridgewater, whose father Paul Anthony Davies died in the bombings, said: ""The coroner has ruled out a lot of things but we want the truth really. ""We want the truth and we want to know what happened back then. It's been too long and there's that many theories out there and unanswered questions as well."" Michelle Sealey, whose father Paul was killed, and Julie Hambleton, whose sister Maxine died, are among family members at the hearings Coroner Sir Peter Thornton said the jury of six women and five men had an ""important civic duty"" as he adjourned the inquests until Tuesday. Theindividual inquestscould last up to six weeks, the coroner said. The jury will return verdicts on how all victims died. Latest news from the West Midlands The hearings began with a minute's silence. Sir Peter said the inquests would not deal with the issue of who planted the bombs, adding that was a ""task of police, prosecutors and the criminal courts"". He said although a single hearing, lasting up to six weeks, the inquests would deal with ""21 separate people, 21 separate lives lost from two terrible events"". Twenty-one people died when two bombs were detonated in Birmingham in 1974 Jurors, sitting at Birmingham Civil Justice Centre, were told they would hear evidence from only a few eyewitnesses because some were ""no longer alive"". Sir Peter added: ""They will be doing their best to recollect events accurately, but we all know memory will sometimes have gaps."" He said there would be details of the so-called ""forewarning issue"", and evidence the British authorities may have received information signalling the attacks, including an alleged tip-off concerning a ""possible conversation in a local prison nearly two weeks before"". Jurors would also hear an account of ""evidence of a students' visit to a police station the evening of the bombings, which was cancelled"", Sir Peter said. Coroner Sir Peter Thornton QC arrives for the start of hearings at Birmingham Civil and Family Justice Centre The families of the victims have fought for years to have inquests reopened Mr Bridgewater said the loved ones of victims had formed close bonds. He said: ""We are a like a close-knit family and that's what bonds us and keeps us strong."" His sister Ms Sealey added: ""It's the knockbacks that make you want to push forward even more because there is something there that we need to find out."" What we know about the bombings An unfinished story: The bombing and its aftermath Why has no-one been prosecuted? Inquests were opened days after the bombings but adjourned because the case was subject to a criminal investigation. The Birmingham Six were jailed for the murders and served 17 years behind bars before their convictions were quashed. This video can not be played Sheila's son Stephen Whalley died in the bombing - she wants to know who was responsible Despite the subsequent overturning of the verdicts, the inquests were never reopened. Fresh inquests were ordered in 2016 but delayed because victims' families disagreed with the coroner, who ruled out naming those suspected of carrying out the bombings. But the Court of Appeal in September upheld the coroner's decision. George Jones (left) and Paul Bodman, who both lost their fathers, said the scope of the inquests was too narrow George Jones, who lost his father John Clifford Jones, told the BBC he hoped the remit of the inquests would have been broader. ""It's an opportunity to answer a lot of questions but my own feelings and those of most of us is those avenues have been cut off by the coroner's decision of narrowing the scope,"" he said. Paul Bodman, whose father Stanley died, described the hearings as ""a tick-box exercise"". ""It's a stepping stone to see what we can get from this inquest and perhaps we can take it further,"" he said. Hearings will continue on Tuesday and Wednesday with pen portraits of each of the victims, while on Thursday, the jurors will be taken to the former sites of the pubs. Sir Peter is due to give his closing address on 28 March before the jury's deliberations start the next day. By Midlands correspondent Sima Kotecha Today marks a significant moment in this long running story. These attacks on Birmingham happened more than four decades ago - and still the families of those killed have many unanswered questions. Some of them have fought with every ounce of their energy to have the inquests into the bombings reopened to try and establish some of the detail that has been missing. Today, the coroner will begin that process of attempting to fill some of the gaps - but will it be enough? Already the scope of the inquests has been narrowed - and the crucial perpetrator issue will not be addressed so the families will not discover who was behind the killings. So what will they learn over these weeks - and will it add anything new to what they already know, even though it may not be in the public domain? The answer to the latter will assess the effectiveness of the process in their eyes. However, for the coroner and the courts, much sought after inquests taking place in the first place is likely to be viewed as a triumph.

"The UK's cyber-security agency has warned that Britain must understand the potential ""opportunities and threats"" of using Chinese technology. In a rare speech, GCHQ director Jeremy Fleming emphasised the need for better cyber-security practices in the telecoms industry. ""It's a hugely complex strategic challenge,"" he said. The US is pressuring its allies to not use Chinese firm Huawei's technology to build new 5G networks. Its officials are concerned that China could be using Huawei products to spy on other countries. Most of the UK's mobile companies - Vodafone, EE and Three - have been working with Huawei on 5G, butthey are awaiting the results of a government review, due in March or April, that will decide whether or not they'll be allowed to go ahead. In December, MI6 chief Alex Youngerraised questions over China's role in the UK tech sector, while a recent report from the Royal United Services Institute saidit would be ""naive"" and ""irresponsible""to allow Huawei access. However, the National Cyber Security Centre - part of GCHQ - said last week said any risk posed by the companycould be managed. Should we worry about Huawei? Why Huawei matters in five charts What is 5G? In his speech at an event in Singapore, Mr Fleming emphasised that the government was concerned about balancing the supply chain and ensuring that there was diversity in the telecommunications equipment supplier market. ""We have to understand the opportunities and threats from China's technological offer - understand the global nature of supply chains and service provision, irrespective of the flag of the supplier,"" he said. ""Take a clear view on the implications of China's technological acquisition strategy in the West, and help our governments decide which parts of this expansion can be embraced, which need risk management, and which will always need a sovereign, or allied, solution."" Could Huawei threaten the Five Eyes? He added: ""How we deal with it will be crucial for prosperity and security way beyond 5G contracts."" Stressing the need for stronger cyber-security across the telecoms sector, Mr Fleming said: ""Vulnerabilities can and will be exploited. But networks should be designed in a way that cauterises the damage."" GCHQ director Jeremy Fleming said that the UK had not yet made a decision on 5G According to Gartner senior research director Sylvain Fabre, 5G is important to the UK government in order to ensure that Britain remains competitive as a country. ""They are reviewing the situation, in a way that hasn't been done in the past, but it sounds like all options are still on the table,"" he told the BBC. Looking historically at the way that mobile operators tender contracts for new network infrastructure, Mr Fabre said that typically telcos selected at least three large vendors, as well as a few smaller suppliers, rather than just one vendor. This strategy ensures that the mobile operator is able to get a range of innovative technologies at competitive prices, which is also good for the market. The US is pursuing criminal chargesagainst Huawei and its chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou. The company's founder, Ren Zhengfei, told the BBCin an exclusive interviewlast week that the US made up only a fraction of its overall business and could not ""crush"" it. He said Huawei would ""continue to invest in the UK"", adding: ""We still trust in the UK, and we hope that the UK will trust us even more."" Speaking at a round table at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona on Sunday, Huawei's rotating chairman, Guo Ping, once again strongly denied allegations that the company's equipment was being used for spying. ""Huawei needs to abide by Chinese laws and also by the laws outside China if we operate in those countries. Huawei will never, and dare not, and cannot violate any rules and regulations in the countries where we operate,"" Mr Guo said, according to AFP. He said he hoped countries would make 5G decisions based on national interests, and not just listen to ""someone else's order"". Could Huawei threaten the Five Eyes?

Colman's win, which took her and the whole of social media by surprise, sparked much reaction online, including a congratulatory tweet from Prime Minister Theresa May: Allow Twitter content?

Melissa McCarthy, who was nominated for best actress for Can You Ever Forgive Me?, also jumped on the cape vibe in a black and white ensemble. It seems that Killing Eve's favourite assassin has a few celebrity fans, judging by some of the looks on the red carpet.

"Soldiers - including those who see active combat - often report symptoms of mental illness including PTSD UK military personnel, veterans and their families are being ""completely failed"" when they need mental health care, a committee of MPs has said. In a report, they said it was a ""scandal"" that a ""shamefully small"" part of the UK's health budget was spent on support for veterans. The NHS and Ministry of Defence should create a specialist mental health centre those in need, the report said. The government said it spends millions on armed forces' mental health care. The recommendations come from the House of Commons Defence Committee - a group of MPs who have been carrying out an inquiry into the issue. Their report,part two of the inquiry,external, says that despite improvements, ""there is no doubt that some serving personnel, veterans and their families who need mental health care are still being completely failed by the system."" 'Higher levels of PTSD among veterans' New mental health helpline for troops 'I feel abandoned by the Army' ""With specific mental health care provision for armed forces families also non-existent, it is no surprise that many veterans and their families believe that they have been abandoned,"" the committee added. It found many servicemen and women often do not seek help because of the stigma around mental health problems and the fear of damaging their career. And the quality of care given to servicemen and women is a postcode lottery - with ""unacceptable variation"" across the UK. Out of an NHS budget of more than Â£150bn, less than Â£10m a year (0.007%) was spent on mental health services specifically for veterans, the committee found. It said demand was ""swamping"" the capacity with some individuals being forced to wait up to a year for treatment. This video can not be played Former soldier Johnny talks about his PTSD The MPs recommended that a ""world-class centre for the treatment of mental injuries"" should be set up within the next 12 to 18 months, where veterans can go as soon as they are diagnosed. They suggest it could be located at the Defence and National Rehabilitation Centre at Stanford Hall in Leicestershire. The NHS in England should consult with the MoD to set it up, the MPs said. And the MoD must also review the help which is available for the families of armed forces personnel and veterans, the report added, as they can also be affected by military life. Ruth Smeeth MP, who chairs the defence committee, said the MPs acknowledged the work being done by the MoD and UK health departments, ""but it is simply nowhere near enough"". She said: ""Fundamental issues still clearly exist, with scandalously little funding allocated to veteran-specific services, and it is unacceptable that veterans and their families should feel abandoned by the state as a result. ""It is vital that veterans get the quality of care they need when they need it, no matter where they live, supported by a world-class national centre."" The chair of the British Medical Association council, Dr Chaand Nagpaul, said the situation as it stands was ""completely untenable"", and welcomed the creation of a specialist mental health facility. The real model army helping veterans with mental health issues Veteran trauma service 'rebuilding lives' The dogs who help veterans with PTSD Depression 'more common in military' A spokeswoman for the government said NHS England was committed to providing mental health care around the country so anyone can access help as close to home as possible. ""This includes bespoke services for veterans, which have been supported by an extra Â£10m as part of the NHS long term plan,"" she said. ""At the same time, the MoD has increased spending on mental health support for those serving in the armed forces to Â£22m a year, and is working to tackle the stigma around asking for help throughout the military community.""

"Rami Malek, Olivia Colman, Regina King and Mahershala Ali pose with their Oscars The first Oscars to go ahead without a host since 1989 was an unqualified success - the best ceremony in years, packed with memorable moments and for (nearly) all the right reasons. Without the need to fit in all the monologues, skits and handovers that are the mainstay of a host's work, time was available for far better speeches and emotional punches; the announcing of a winner given a precious few extra seconds for its meaning to really take root. Kevin Hart's decision to take himself out of the hosting duties following the resurfacing of homophobic tweets had initially presented the Academy with a huge problem. Suddenly the job looked like a poisoned chalice. Olivia Colman's varied career in pictures Olivia Colman and Green Book win Oscars Oscars 2019: Winners and nominees in full Which Oscars outfits have caused a stir? In pictures: Red carpet glamour Who was a big enough name who had so little troublesome material in their back catalogue that they, too, wouldn't feel a Twitter backlash the moment they were announced? No-one, it seemed. So the Oscars went hostless for the first time since the disastrous 1989 show, regarded as the worst in history - though this actually was nothing to do with not having a host; the awfulness was down to some badly misguided song-and-dance routines. A look back at the 'debacle' of 1989's hostless Oscars And it went so well, it would almost be a surprise if they bother with a host again. Faced with only a few weeks to pull a whole new show together, the producers had two brilliant ideas. Maya Rudolph, Tina Fey and Amy Poehler gave the closest the awards got to an opening monologue The first was to get Tiny Fey, Amy Poehler and Maya Rudolph to effectively do the traditional opening monologue (after an opening performance from Queen, which got most people mildly waving an arm around, in a we've-not-really-had-enough-to-drink-yet-but-OK kind of way). Fey and Poehler had hosted the Golden Globes before and had been tipped as potential Oscars hosts; this was near-as-dammit them doing it, except they (with Rudolph) did a show's worth of material in two minutes. Fey and Poehler: Dream Golden Globes double act ""We're not hosting, but if we were, these are the jokes we would make"" was their take. It was very post-modern but it really worked. They raced through so many references - to Netflix; to Fyre Festival; to Donald Trump's wall; to the show's chaotic recent months and the wrangling over taking out awards - it was hard to keep up. ""We won't be doing awards during the commercials, but we will be presenting commercials during the awards,"" said Poehler. ""So if all the winners could all say Hellman's Mayonnaise: We're on the side of food instead of their speeches, that would be great."" And then they left. All killer lines. No padding, no filler, no flannel. Brilliant. The other great idea was to expand the range of people announcing the nominees for best picture. Now that eight films are in contention, each gets a little spot where a celebrity introduces them. It's usually actors who do this, of course - but this time around, Serena Williams, Trevor Noah and Tom Morello from Rage Against The Machine all got a go. Serena Williams made a welcome appearance on stage It even meant that Mike Myers and Dana Carvey could reprise their roles as Wayne and Garth from Wayne's World. It was fun, it expanded the diversity of presenters, and it worked. And it was the first Oscars where there was no groaner, no badly-received dig or in-joke that was just too in. Awkward moments - such as the make-up crew from Vice struggling desperately to read their speech - came solely from the award winners. (Well, that and Samuel L Jackson having to hand over a best original screenplay Oscar to Green Book. As good an actor as Jackson is - and there are few better - he could not act happy for that.) But the good moments - of which there were many - were allowed to breathe and stand out so much because they weren't rushed in order to fit the meaningless skits that exist just to give the host something to do, like when Jimmy Kimmel brought in a busload of tourists to confusedly mill around the Dolby Theatre. So when Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper sang Shallow together, the camera could linger on them as the song finished rather than rushing off - thus providing an iconic Oscar image for years to come. And when Olivia Colman won best actress, she got some proper time to say what she wanted as the tears rolled down her face. She talked about her children and she talked about young girls watching and practising their own acceptance speeches. It was touching and wonderful. Olivia Colman is the first British best female winner in 10 years (Colman's life story could one day be an Oscar-winning film in itself - from the low of Confetti, when the film-makers went back on a promise to pixelate her nudity, to winning an Academy Award.  Confetti's director, meanwhile, has since made four Nativity films; thus far they have all been untroubled by Oscar nominations.) And there was also the sheer joy when - a minute after having to hold his nose with the Green Book award, Samuel L Jackson got to give best adapted screenplay to BlacKkKlansman's writer ""Spike LEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!"" Spike Lee won his first Oscar at the ceremony It was Lee's first win at the fifth time of being nominated. He made the most overtly political speech of the night: ""The 2020 presidential election is around the corner. ""Let's all mobilise. Let's all be be on the right side of history. Make the moral choice between love versus hate. Let's do the right thing."" But there were several heartfelt references from the wide variety of winners from different backgrounds to political issues. Javier Bardem spoke - in Spanish, with subtitles, a first - of how ""there are no borders or walls that can restrain ingenuity or talent"". Chef Jose Andres spoke of ""immigrants and women, who move humanity forward"". Melissa Berton and Rayka Zehtabchi's speech was emotionally charged as they collected the documentary award for Period The winners of best short documentary for Period. End Of Sentence talked of the enormous issues that still exist around access to sanitary products. Meanwhile, the one thing that went unmentioned was the name of Bohemian Rhapsody's director, Bryan Singer - currently the subject of claims that he has sexually abused boys and men;claims he has denied. Every time Bohemian Rhapsody won, it was the members of Queen who were thanked instead. Then Green Book won best film, and the whole mood dropped a notch. For doing that, the Academy itself deserves a collective Naked Gun Oscars-audience-slap-themselves-on-the-head gif. Never mind. They need never bother with a host again.

"Olivia Colman accepted her award for best actress at the Oscars in style, calling the win ""hilarious"". She played Queen Anne in The Favourite, winning the only award for the film at the 91st Academy Awards. ""I have to thank lots of people and if I forget anybody I'll find you later and give you a massive snog,"" she added during an emotional speech. Colman became the 11th British actress to take home the prize. Olivia Colman's varied career in pictures Olivia Colman and Green Book win Oscars Oscars 2019: Winners and nominees in full Which Oscars outfits have caused a stir? In pictures: Red carpet glamour The last time a Brit won the accolade was in 2009, when Kate Winslet won for her portrayal of Hanna Schmitz in The Reader. Her co-stars, Rachel Weisz and Emma Stone, were both nominated for best supporting actress but lost out to Regina King. Yorgos Lanthimos' film The Favourite received 10 nominations in total. Colman's win, which took her and the whole of social media by surprise, sparked much reaction online, including a congratulatory tweet from Prime Minister Theresa May: Allow Twitter content?

"The world's two largest economies have been locked in a bitter trade battle. The dispute has seen the US and China impose tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars worth of one another's goods. US President Donald Trump has long accused China of unfair trading practices and intellectual property theft. In China, there is a perception that America is trying to curb its rise as a global economic power. The US-China trade war in charts US-China trade war: 'We're all paying for this' Negotiations are ongoing but have proven difficult. In January,the two sides signed a preliminary dealbut some of the thorniest issues remain unresolved. Uncertainties around the trade war have hurt businesses and weighed on the global economy. Mr Trump's tariffs policy aims to encourage consumers to buy American products by making imported goods more expensive. The US has imposed tariffs on more than $360bn (Â£268bn) of Chinese goods, and China has retaliated with tariffs on more than $110bn of US products. Washington delivered three rounds of tariffs in 2018, and a fourth one in September last year.The most recent round targeted Chinese imports, from meat to musical instruments, with a 15% duty.,external Beijing hit back with tariffs ranging from 5% to 25% on US goods. Under the so-called ""phase one"" deal signed in January, China pledged to boost US imports by $200bn above 2017 levels and strengthen intellectual property rules. Trump escalates trade war with fresh tariff hikes US delays some tariffs on Chinese imports The US agreed to halve some of the new tariffs it had imposed on China. The White House said it will tackle additional issues in a second, ""phase two"" deal but analysts said they didn't expect anything concrete anytime soon.

"Can the US and China bridge their divisions? Top trade officials from the US and China are meeting in Washington as a deadline to strike a deal approaches. This is the second round of talks since Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping met in Argentina last year and agreed to negotiate in the hope of defusing an escalating tariff war. There is widespread scepticism that the two sides can reach a substantive deal by the 1 March deadline. Recent charges against Huawei have added to the complications. At a press conference this week, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow made few promises. ""Let me just remind people, we do have another 30 days after this so my expectation is we'll make significant progress at these meetings, but I would just emphasize these are complicated issues,"" Mr Mnuchin said. Last week, US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said the two sides remained ""miles and miles"" apart. The Chinese delegation will be led by Vice Premier Liu He, a close economic adviser of Mr Xi, and central bank governor Yi Gang. They will meet with the US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and White House trade advisor Peter Navarro. Mr Trump has long blamed China's rise as an exporter for a loss of manufacturing and other jobs in the US. But the issues facing the two countries are broader than the trade deficit. A quick guide to the US-China trade war Three things the US and China will never agree on Trade war: Firms look to new factories as tariffs bite The US is pressing China to make changes to its economic policies, which it says unfairly favour domestic companies through subsidies and other support. It has also accused the government of supporting technology theft as part of its broader development strategy. The US imposed tariffs on $250bn worth of Chinese goods last year. China retaliated in kind, hitting $110bn of US products with duties. The moves rattled financial markets and contributed to worries about economic slowdown in both countries, especially in China. That has generated pressure for a deal, but it remains uncertain if the two sides will be able to overcome their differences. Why China is under pressure to make a trade deal China's weakening trade figures should concern us all Chinese officials are resistant to the wholesale changes sought by the US and thecharges against Huawei- one of China's biggest and most successful technology firms - have added to the political tensions. Meanwhile, Mr Trump,a self-described ""Tariff Man"",external, rejected a previous proposal from Beijing to resolve the dispute with increased purchases of US goods. China has reportedly expanded that offer in recent weeks. And at times, Mr Trump has seemed eager to assure the public that an agreement remains within reach. It would make ""so much sense"" for China to ""finally do a Real Deal"", he wrote on Twitter this month. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

You may want to readTwitterâs cookie policy,externalandprivacy policy,externalbefore accepting. To view this content chooseâaccept and continueâ. If the two sides cannot reach an agreement by 1 March, the US has said it will increase the tariff rate from 10% to 25% on Chinese goods worth an estimated $200bn. Mr Trump has also threatened tariffs on an additional $267bn worth of products. With White House advisors reportedly divided, the focus is on Mr Trump, who is scheduled to meet with Mr Liu in Washington this week as part of the talks. Economists worry the tariffs will hurt global trade Mr Trump may decide a deal would boost his political standing after a bruising fight with Democrats over border wall funding and the government shutdown. But he could also hope to shore up his base with protectionism. Analysts at Capital Economics said: ""We think the two countries may just be able to reach a face-saving agreement to tide them over in the short term and avoid an escalation."" For now, odds favour the limited truce lasting a little longer.

"In Washington this week, the US and China are due to hold their highest level talks since the two sides struck a temporary truce to their trade war. They have until 1 March to come up with some sort of compromise or tariffs will be hiked again, and we march back into a trade fight that affects us all. China watchers tell me Beijing is under increasing pressure to make a deal. Here's why: The trade war may not have caused China's slowdown, but it is definitely making things worse. Growth data released last weekshowed China posted the slowest growth rate since 1990 but that in itself is not as worrying as other data points, including that consumer sentiment and retail sales are flatlining or weakening fast. Small and medium-sized companies in China are feeling the chill with lower orders and inventories. How worrying is China's slowdown? A quick guide to the US-China trade war Just how much pressure the Communist Party is facing because of a weakening economy was reflected in arare acknowledgement by President Xi Jinping,external, whose legitimacy is based in part in keeping China strong. There is also evidence to show that foreign firms are diversifying their sourcing, production and supply chains away from China, if not pulling out altogether. Thisrecent survey conducted by QIMA,external, a leading Asian supply chain auditor, shows that 30% of more than 100 global businesses are diverting their sourcing from China to other countries. As many as three-quarters of these companies have started sourcing suppliers in new countries. If this trend continues then jobs in Chinese factories are at risk - a recent report looking at China's economy by JP Morgan points to rising unemployment as a major near-term risks. Social stability is predicated on China's economic stability, and the Communist Party is well aware that its credibility lies in delivering the Chinese dream to its people. The fate of Huawei also hangs in the balance, both from a business and diplomatic standpoint. China is big on symbolism and ""doesn't believe in coincidences"" Einar Tangen, an advisor on economic affairs for the Chinese government, told me on the line from Beijing. Mr Tangen pointed to the arrest of Meng Wanzhou, the daughter of Huawei founder, which took place on the day President Xi and US President Donald Trump met at the G20 summit and declared the temporary truce between the two sides, setting the 90 day deadline for talks. What's going on with Huawei? The Huawei exec trapped in a gilded cage Another date looms next week, with the latest round of talks taking place on the day theUS has to file the extradition treaty for Ms Meng. ""Both of these dates are seen as attempts by the US to use Huawei as leverage in the trade talks,"" says Mr Tangen. The US is alsoreportedly preparing an investigation into Huaweiwhich could see it banned from buying American chips, a move that crippled China's ZTE last year. Mr Tangen warns that pushing Beijing will backfire. ""The Chinese see this as the US trying to push China down,"" he says. ""This is not about right or wrong. They view this in context of the 100 years of humiliation they suffered at the hands of the West and they don't want that repeated."" But the US is also under pressure to make a deal. American firms in China havecomplained about the impact of Trump's tariffs on their business,externalbut want the US to make a good deal. ""This administration has been willing to risk the health of the US economy with tariffs,"" says Stephen Kho, international trade partner at law firm Akin Gump in Washington DC. ""So now that we've come this far, businesses want to take advantage of this moment and walk away from these talks with something significant. They will want to see China's offer to buy more American goods along with promises of systemic changes."" A solution to the US-China trade war is good for us all. The longer these two superpowers slap tariffs on each other's goods, the more expensive products will be for us, companies will report lower profits, and global growth will slow. Both sides are under pressure to make a deal. But this is ultimately, as Mr Kho also points out, ""a game of chicken."" Whoever blinks first could also be the biggest loser.

"This video can not be played May: Brexit deal ""within grasp"" for 29 March MPs will be able to have a fresh vote on the Brexit deal by 12 March, Prime Minister Theresa May has said. Speaking as she travelled to an EU-Arab League summit in Egypt, Mrs May ruled out holding another so-called ""meaningful vote"" this week. But she said ""positive"" talks with the EU were ""still ongoing"" and leaving on 29 March was ""within our grasp"". Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn accused the prime minister of ""recklessly running down the clock"". In a tweet,external, he said the move was intended to ""force MPs to choose between her bad deal and a disastrous no deal"". Labour, he said, would ""work with MPs across the Commons to prevent no deal, break the deadlock and build support for our alternative plan"". Brexit must not be frustrated, May vows Cabinet trio issue Brexit delay warning Brexit: A really simple guide A lonely PM nears the Brexit endgame On the plane to Sharm el-Sheikh for a summit between EU and Arab league leaders, Mrs May said her team would be returning to the Belgian capital on Tuesday for further talks. ""As a result of that, we won't bring a meaningful vote to Parliament this week, but we will ensure that that happens by 12 March,"" she added. Mrs May has already met European Council President Donald Tusk for talks after landing in Egypt and will meet other EU leaders on the fringes of the summit later. She said negotiations were continuing over the backstop - the controversial policy that aims to prevent a hard border returning to the island of Ireland - after Parliament voted for her to seek ""alternative arrangements"" to what is set out in her deal. It's true that playing for time is a powerful, if cynical, political strategy and the Labour Party - and lots of Conservatives too - are annoyed that Downing Street seems to be dragging its feet like this and won't give MPs a formal thumbs up or thumbs down vote for more than another fortnight. The prime minister naming the next vote day might do a little to calm the tempers of those in government who have been very publicly suggesting that strategy is madness. 12 March is at least, for them, before the next EU summit. It is not, as these things go, the final, final, moment. Reckless, many will suggest, but not a total kamikaze mission. But it won't stop the senior MPs Yvette Cooper and Oliver Letwin, still pushing for a vote next week for their own bill that would force the government to delay Brexit if they don't have a deal in place by... guess when? 13 March. Oh look - the day AFTER Number 10's new deadline. Here, the date of 12 March suggests that the government is, as one source suggested, ""planning for every eventuality"". In other words - they think it's likely MPs might indeed vote this week to extend the process if a deal hasn't been done. Read Laura's blog Mrs May also rejected an accusation - made last week by MP Anna Soubry as she quit the Conservative Party - that she had a ""personal problem"" with immigration. ""I have consistently said that immigration has been good for this country,"" the prime minister said, adding: ""It's important that we have welcomed people coming to the country over the years - both people migrating to the UK for work purposes but also crucially those many refugees and asylum seekers."" This video can not be played Anna Soubry tells Newsnight's Kirsty Wark she was 'worried' the prime minister had a problem with immigration. And she also made clear that she wants to stay on in Number 10 after the first phase of Brexit finishes, despitehaving promised her MPsshe would not fight the next election. She said her job ""is not just about delivering Brexit"" and ""there is still a domestic agenda that I want to get on with."" Yvette Cooper called the latest delay ""utterly shambolic"",tweeting,external: ""Each time we get closer to cliff edge. How are businesses, public services and families supposed to plan in this chaos?"" The SNP's Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, alsocalled,externalthe delay ""unacceptable"". And the director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, Adam Marshall, said it was ""unbelievable"" to leave the vote so close to the planned exit date. Allow Twitter content?

On Wednesday, MPs will get another chance to put forward a range of amendments to show what direction they want Brexit to take. Top of the list is the Cooper-Letwin amendment - and cabinet ministers Greg Clark, Amber Rudd and David Gaukewrote in the Daily Mail,externalthat they would be forced to back it if the pro-Leave European Research Group (ERG) - made up of Tory backbenchers - stood in the way of the withdrawal deal being agreed ""in the next few days"". The ERG would then have ""no-one to blame but themselves for delaying Brexit,"" the trio said. Environment Secretary Michael Gove has urged his cabinet colleagues against backing the Cooper-Letwin amendment, calling for ""unity"" behind the PM. This video can not be played Gove: âI will do everything I can to persuade colleagues to stay in government.â Labour is also likely to table an amendment on Wednesday, putting its own Brexit plan - one which backs a permanent customs union with the EU and a close relationship with its single market - to MPs. While it's likely to be rejected, the moment could still be significant. The party's conference last September bound the leadership to explore all remaining alternatives to the PM's Brexit plan, including a public vote, if it wasn't able to force a general election. Efforts to get an election have failed, so if Labour's own Brexit plan is defeated in the Commons, the only remaining option would be a new referendum. Labour's deputy leader Tom Watson told the BBC's Andrew Marr programme that ""we are heading in that direction"", but ""there is still more play in the days ahead"". Mr Watson said the leadership was also looking at an amendment drawn up by two backbenchers, Peter Kyle and Phil Wilson, which would be tabled whenever the next meaningful vote is held. Under the terms of that amendment, Labour MPs would support the prime minister's Brexit deal in exchange for it then being put to a public vote. Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney warnedon Sunday that his government could not be asked to ""compromise on something as fundamental as the peace process"", on which the border played a key part. He accused the UK government of wanting to change the backstop to ""placate a group in the Conservative Party who are insisting on moving the prime minister away from her own policies"", and reiterated that the EU would not re-open the withdrawal agreement. But he told Sky News they would try to ""provide reassurance and clarification for the British Parliament to allow them to ratify this deal"". Speaking from the summit on Sunday, Austria's Chancellor Sebastian Kurz said it ""would be good to postpone Brexit"" if the deal was not agreed by the beginning of March.

"One of the last elephant sanctuaries in Africa has ""a significant elephant-poaching problem"", according to the final results of an aerial wildlife survey in Botswana seen by the BBC. Elephants Without Borders, which conducted the four-yearly survey with the government, said there was a six-fold increase in the number of ""fresh"" or ""recent"" elephant carcasses in northern Botswana amid ""obvious signs"" of poaching. Mike Chase, the scientist who carried out the survey, sparked a fierce debate in the country when he wentpublic half-way through his study in August last yearwith accusations there was a poaching problem and alleging the authorities were ignoring him. This video can not be played Dozens of dead elephants have been discovered in poaching hot spots in Botswana, Africa He told the BBC at the time that while flying over northern Botswana, he had discovered 87 recently killed elephants in one ""hotspot"" area - a number now revised to 88 - and 128 overall. The government called his figures ""false and misleading"" and criticised ""unsubstantiated and sensational media reports"". He received death threats and has since had one of his two research licences suspended by the government. President Mokgweetsi Masisi at the time described the allegations as the ""biggest hoax of the 21st Century"" and denied there had been a spike in poaching in the country. But the final report identifies four poaching hotspots, provides photographic evidence from ground surveys and has been peer-reviewed by nine international elephant experts. ""The response fromâ¦ various people was to try and deny or whitewash - label me a traitor and a liar - without having actually verified the evidence we bore witness to,"" said Mr Chase. Mike Chase said he found a six-fold increase in the number of ""fresh"" carcasses in northern Botswana The government didn't respond to the BBC's request for an interview about the final report, but issued a statement criticising the methods used in carrying out the survey. The statement from Thato Raphaka, permanent secretary of the Ministry of Environment, Natural Resources Conservation and Tourism, said it was ""regrettable"" the report showed an ""astonishing number of pictures of dead elephants"". It was critical of some of the scientific details in the report and requested the raw data to be submitted to the elephant specialist group at the International Union for Conservation of Nature for further independent review. Otisitwe Tiroyamodimo, the director of the Department of Wildlife and National Parks, said the government acknowledged there was a poaching problem. ""Nobody can deny that elephants are being killed in Botswana,"" but those reported by Mr Chase had mainly died ""from natural causes and retaliatory killings."" ""We went there and we couldn't find the 87 carcasses,"" said Mr Tiroyamodimo. The authorities flew with Mr Chase but admit they spent only two days trying to verify carcasses seen over two months. The BBC was given permission by the government to have access to the coordinates of one of the four areas identified as a ""poaching hotspot"" by the research team, and we visited the sites of 67 elephant carcasses. A few had apparently died of natural causes, but most had the characteristics associated with being poached: tusks were missing and branches had been used to cover the bodies to prevent them being found. But Botswana is home to 130,000 elephants - a third of the total number in Africa - and it is an obvious target for poachers. Even when extrapolating poaching figures from the sample found in the survey, the numbers killed will not have a major impact on such a large population. ""If we are talking about a number of carcasses that have accumulated over a period of two years, given the population of elephants in Botswana it doesn't really raise eyebrows,"" said national parks director Mr Tiroyamodimo. This was not satisfactory for Mr Chase. ""At what point do we say we have a problem?"" he asked. ""Is it at 10? 50? 100? 150? 1,000? Lessons have taught us - when we look at Tanzania that lost 60% of its elephant population in five years - that's how quickly poaching can settle into a population. ""We saw with our own eyes 157 confirmed poached elephants. We estimate that the total poached in the last year is at least 385 and probably far more because that is based on what we actually saw and have not had time or finances to visit all carcasses on the ground."" But the storm over the reported spike in poaching appears to have more to do with Botswana's bitter and complicated new politics than its wildlife. President Masisi was vice-president until April 2018, when then-President Ian Khama handed power over to his deputy. Since then the two men have fallen out. The new president has his own vision on a number of issues, among them conservation, and has reversed some of the previous policies. Hunting was banned under President Khama and Botswana was known for a zero-tolerance approach to poachers. It was reported that in 2015 alone 30 Namibians, 22 Zimbabweans and an unknown number of Zambians were shot on suspicion of poaching. Elephants can be very destructive when they encroach on to farmland and move though villages - destroying crops and sometimes killing people. Many rural communities believe the number of elephants is increasing, even though there is no evidence of this from scientific surveys. But their ""range"" - how far the elephants travel - is expanding for a number of different reasons and that is increasing conflict between wildlife and humans. Many people believe this worsened after hunting was banned in 2013, and want it to be re-introduced. The government has to balance lifting the hunting ban to win votes against the impact it may have on Botswana's international reputation as a luxury safari destination. 'Elephant refugee' problem in Africa The country that brought its elephants back from the brink The war on elephants President Masisi removed ""weapons of war"" from the national parks' small anti-poaching unit, saying they were illegal for non-military officers. A consultation he initiated has justrecommended that the hunting ban be lifted and that elephants be culled and their meat canned for pet food. Thirteen rhinos have also been killed by poachers in the last year Botswana is also now backing regional efforts to lift a ban on the ivory trade. The two men are locked in a political feud ahead of a party congress which will choose a new leader, with national elections due later in the year. Mr Chase has a close relationship with the former president, so the timing of his allegations has been seen by some as a political attack on the new president - even if the final report provides evidence that poaching was going on before Mr Masisi took office. Botswana attracts high-end tourists from across the world because of its international reputation for successful conservation. But with the continuing political storm - and a dependency on government permits to run high-end safaris - few of the big safari operators would comment on how big a problem poaching has become. Thirteen rhinos have been killed by poachers in the last 12 months - an unprecedented number.

""I think the government has been hiding it for a while, and now that it's been brought out into the open, we're now realising how serious the problem is, and these big poachers have actually infiltrated further than we expected them to be."" Kim Nixon from Wilderness Safaris says all cases of poaching are reported Wilderness Safaris operates luxury lodges in one of the concessions where some of the 88 carcasses were found. Its chief executive Kim Nixon rejected any suggestion there was a denial of the problem. ""Whenever poaching has occurred in any of our concession areas, each and every incident has been reported as a criminal case,"" he said. ""We're not in any way mandated or allowed to do any anti-poaching - our role at best is monitoring."" Mr Chase says ""don't shoot the messenger"" adding: ""I think it requires all stakeholders working together - government, private, public sectors, the NGOs."" Botswana is still the safest place in the world to be a rhino or an elephant, but with a continuing demand for ivory in Asia, it is now firmly in the poachers' sights.

"Trade talks between the US and China have broken up without a deal, with the US warning that ""very difficult issues"" remain unresolved. The talks in China this week were aimed at securing a new deal before further US tariffs are imposed on 1 March. China said negotiations would now continue in the US next week. ""We feel that we have to make headway on some very, very important and very difficult issues,"" said top US trade negotiator Robert Lighthizer. However, he said he was ""hopeful"" of progress. President Xi Jinping said he hoped talks next week would ""continue to work hard to promote a mutually beneficial and win-win agreement."" The two countries have been locked in an escalating trade war, imposing  duties on billions of dollars worth of one another's goods. Trump could let China trade deadline 'slide' Three things the US and China will never agree on Firms look to new factories as tariffs bite US-China trade war in 300 words In December,both countries agreed to halt new tariffsfor 90 days to allow for talks. The US has said it will increase tariff rates on $200bn worth of Chinese imports from 10% to 25% if the two sides do not strike a deal by 1 March. But President Trump recently hinted thatthis deadline could be extendedif they are making good progress in negotiations with China. By Andrew Walker, BBC World Service economics correspondent It's a relatively optimistic tone from officials on both sides and at very senior levels too: President Xi himself for China and two US Cabinet level figures, in the shape of the Treasury Secretary and the US Trade Representative. Talks to continue in Washington next week.  So is (trade) peace imminent? That would be a rash assumption to make. We have had warm words before and the big ask from the US side is difficult for China. The next stage in China's economic development really does need technology and they will not easily agree to give up the practice of expecting foreign investors to share theirs. That said, a willingness to continue talking as soon as next week, does suggest some reason for hope. Washington is pressing Beijing to make changes to its economic policies, which it says unfairly favour domestic companies through subsidies and other support. The US has also accused the government of supporting technology theft as part of its broader development strategy. It wants to bring down its large trade deficit with the Asian powerhouse and wants China to buy more US goods. China has proposed to increase purchases of US goods, such as semiconductors and soybeans, but is unlikely to let up on its economic development model, according to media reports. There is also a sense among some in China that the US is using the trade war to contain its rise, as the two superpowers jostle for global leadership. Countries elsewherehave also become waryof China's rise.Several governments have blocked telecoms companiesfrom using equipment made by Huawei, the Chinese telecoms giant, in next-generation 5G mobile networks due to security concerns. The US has imposed tariffs on $250bn worth of Chinese goods, and China has retaliated by imposing duties on $110bn of US products. Mr Trump has also threatened further tariffs on an additional $267bn worth of Chinese products - which would see virtually all of Chinese imports into the US become subject to these tariffs.

"This video can not be played Tom Watson: ""I know that he (Jeremy Corbyn) will... share my horror"" Jeremy Corbyn must take a ""personal lead"" over claims of anti-Semitism in the Labour Party, his deputy has said. Tom Watson told the BBC's Andrew Marr that there was a ""crisis for the soul"" of the party, fearing more MPs might followthe nine who resigned this week. But he said with the situation being so ""grave"", Mr Corbyn understood he needed to make a ""personal intervention"". A Labour spokesman said the party takes all complaints about anti-Semitism ""extremely seriously"". Mr Watson said he had sent 50 such complaints to his leader this week. Latest MP to quit Labour 'ashamed' of party What does it feel like to quit a party? Labour defectors betrayed seats, says Thornberry A guide to Labour anti-Semitism claims The deputy leader's comments follow the resignations of nine Labour MPs -eight of which have joined The Independent Group. One its members, the former Labour MP Luciana Berger, was subjected to anti-Semitic abuse while a member of the party, Appearing on the Andrew Marr Show before Mr Watson, Ms Berger criticised the party's culture, saying: ""My values haven't changed. I am the same person. It is my party that has changed."" Luciana Berger quit the Labour Party on Monday over its handling of anti-Semitism Mr Watson said Ms Berger had been ""bullied out of the party by a small number of racist thugs"", and attempts to stamp out anti-Semitism so far had ""not been adequate"" and ""have not succeeded"". He said Mr Corbyn needed to ""rebuild that trust"" with the Jewish community across the country and it will be his ""test as leader"" to eradicate anti-Semitism from the party. ""Of course Jeremy [Corbyn] needs to understand that if we're going to be in No 10, he needs to change the Labour Party and there are things we need to do,"" he said. ""We've got to eradicate anti-Semitism, anti-Jewish racism in all its forms [and] for us to address that now, I think he needs to take a personal lead on examining those cases and if necessary, recommend it to our NEC (National Executive Committee) what needs to be done."" Mr Watson also criticised the language of shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry, who said those who resigned from her party had ""betrayed"" their seats and would be ""crushed"" if by-elections were held. She told a Labour rally in Broxtowe, Nottinghamshire, that she would rather die than join a new party. Mr Watson said he thought ""dying is a virtue that is over-rated"" and said it was ""incumbent on all of us to dial down the rhetoric"". After his appearance, a Labour Party spokesman said: ""The Labour Party takes all complaints of anti-Semitism extremely seriously and we are committed to challenging and campaigning against it in all its forms. ""All complaints about anti-Semitism are investigated in line with our rules and procedures and any appropriate disciplinary action is taken.""

"Maurizio Sarri was preparing to bring on Willy Caballero Have you ever seen anything like it? A player refusing to go off - and his manager losing the plot. Chelsea goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga resisted Maurizio Sarri's attempt to substitute him late in extra time of the Carabao Cup final, which left his manager seething on the touchline. Kepa had just been treated for cramp and, with the game at 0-0, Sarri was preparing to bring on reserve keeper Willy Caballero in his place before a penalty shootout. But after some furious finger-wagging and screams of ""NO!"", Sarri was forced to give in. Referee Jonathan Moss ran over to confirm whether Kepa was going off or not and Sarri, begrudgingly, backed down and then stormed off down the tunnel before quickly returning, leaving Caballero a bemused spectator. 'This was a painful, public indignity' - has Sarri been fatally undermined? Man City win Carabao Cup penalty shootout Arrizabalaga incident a misunderstanding - Sarri 'Kepa has completely undermined Sarri' Kepa went on to save Leroy Sane's spot-kick - prompting a fist pump from Sarri - but Raheem Sterling netted the winning penalty as Manchester City won the shootout 4-3 to lift the Carabao Cup for a second year in a row. Sarri didn't react at full-time and went straight off the pitch, while his players looked dejected in defeat. This video can not be played Kepa situation was big misunderstanding - Sarri Former Blues striker Chris Sutton described the scenes as ""mutiny at Chelsea"" and said Kepa ""should never play for the club again"". The incident comes after weeks of speculation surrounding Sarri's position as manager andconcerns over his style of play,the so-called ""Sarri-ball"". ""That should be his last performance in a Chelsea shirt,"" Sutton told BBC Radio 5 live. ""He's a disgrace. I've never seen anything like it. ""If I was Sarri I would walk. You cannot be undermined. Why weren't the players dragging Kepa off anyway? ""Kepa should be sacked, not Sarri. He's been undermined - it's the worst thing that can happen to a manager."" This video can not be played 'Kepa has completely undermined Maurizio Sarri' Former England and Tottenham midfielder Jermaine Jenas said it is clear ""there's a lack of respect"" for the manager, but said Sarri showed ""a lack of class"" by storming off the pitch following defeat. ""His players have done him proud today,"" Jenas told BBC Radio 5 live. ""They are an inferior team to Manchester City now and they took them all the way. For him not to be congratulating the opposition or consoling his players shows a lack of class for me. ""The fact he went inside and was not out there with his players is one thing, but it has to be infuriating for one of your players to categorically tell you to 'do one' and say I'm staying on this pitch. ""This is a huge blemish. It all boils down to what is going on between Sarri and his players. That does not happen - there's a lack of respect somewhere along the line."" Chelsea keeper Kepa Arrizabalaga goes down with cramp towards the end of extra time Reserve keeper Willy Caballero is ready to come on Kepa screams back at his manager and signifies he doesn't want to be taken off Maurizio Sarri (left) responds furiously to Kepa while his assistant Gianfranco Zola looks perplexed Referee Jonathan Moss joins in to ask Sarri whether he wants to bring off his keeper Chelsea defender David Luiz tries to calm Kepa down on the pitch Reserve keeper Caballero is left confused in the dugout, unsure whether the substitution is being made Sarri storms down the tunnel and the whistle is blown for the end of extra time Tony: What? Kepa on the transfer market tomorrow I think. Craig: Chelsea keeper has zero respect for the manager! Don't care who you are, if he wants you off he wants you off. Jonathan:Sounds like Sarri has lost the dressing room, the bench and his mind. Robert: Disgusting! Kepa has just publicly embarrassed Sarri in front of everyone. Total disgrace. Callum: I'm with Kepa there I don't think he should come off, he's played the full game so confidence is high, I don't agree with goalkeepers being subbed for penalty shootouts no matter how good they have been. Will: It doesn't matter whether Kepa could continue or not, the manager made a decision to take him off and that should be the end of that. You can't refuse to work for your boss in any other line of work, why should football be any different? Rob: Chelsea is broken from top to bottom. Player power has dominated that club for years. If Sarri leaves I would respect him so much. James: Player power over everyone else at a club has been building slowly for the past few years. This is a pivotal moment for the way football clubs are run.
