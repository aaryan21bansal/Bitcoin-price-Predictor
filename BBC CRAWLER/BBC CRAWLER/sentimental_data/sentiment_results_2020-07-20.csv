"On Thursday 12 March, everyday life remained relatively normal across the UK. The back pages of the newspapers were dominated by the victory of Atletico Madrid over Liverpool - 50,000 fans had crammed into Anfield stadium. Throughout that day shoppers shopped, while millions drove to work or poured out of trains into city centres. And in the evening, people went out. At Wembley Arena, Lewis Capaldi sang to an audience of 12,000 fans - having urged them to bring hand sanitiser with them. Around the UK people headed for events big and small. But these were not normal times. A new coronavirus was spreading across the globe. On that day, Italy was shutting all non-essential shops and the Republic of Ireland announced that schools would close. But looking back, the question that will always be asked is - did the UK go into lockdown too slowly? Should those crowds have been out that day? The World Health Organization (WHO) had been asking countries to do everything they could to contain the infection since late February. And some countries were scaling up test and trace to try to suppress the virus. But on 12 March, the UK had all but abandoned community testing to focus on those sick enough to be admitted to hospital. At the time, there were 590 known cases of coronavirus in the UK - more than four times the number in the previous week. The government announced it was moving out of the ""contain"" phase into the ""delay"" phase. The risk level was raised to high, and anyone with symptoms was asked to self-isolate for a week. The lockdown was yet to start. At a press conference Prime Minister Boris Johnson, his chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance and chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty explained the policy to keep schools open and to allow major public events to go ahead. Johnson said that according to scientific advice, banning major public events would have little effect on the spread of the disease. Prof Whitty argued that beginning social distancing measures ""too early"" would risk people becoming tired of them and public compliance waning. And Sir Patrick began to talk about the concept of herd immunity. Speaking about the coronavirus he said: ""It's not possible to stop everybody getting it and it's also actually not desirable because you want some immunity in the population. We need immunity to protect ourselves from this in the future."" Mr Johnson reiterated that people should remember to wash their hands. The next day tens of thousands of people poured into Cheltenham Racecourse to watch the Gold Cup. Sir Patrick was on BBC Radio 4's Today programme. He said the thinking behind the government's approach was to try to ""reduce the peak"", and because most people would only get a ""mild illness"", to ""build up some degree of herd immunityâ¦ so that more people are immune to this disease and we reduce the transmission"". At the same time, he said, the vulnerable would need to be protected from the virus. In response to a question asking whether it would be a ""good thing"" to allow the disease to spread widely now, rather than later, Sir Patrick replied he didn't want high numbers of infections over a short period of time, overwhelming the NHS. ""So that's the flattening of the peak. You can't stop it, so that you should end up with a broader peak, during which time you would anticipate that more people will get immunity to this and that in itself then becomes a protective part of this process."" He said previous epidemics had shown that measures to strongly suppress the virus risked it bouncing back when they were ended. ""Herd immunity"" is a concept describing the point at which a population has developed protection against a disease. There are two ways to do this. Vaccination is one route. But with any new virus it's impossible to say how long it will take to develop a vaccine, if ever. The other way is for people to catch the disease and build up some form of immunity. If exposed to the virus again, it is assumed they have protection. If most people in a population are protected then the virus cannot spread. But there are two problems. One is that with a new virus - like this particular coronavirus - it's not always clear how much protection having had the disease, particularly a mild case, gives you or how long it lasts. And if most of the population catches the disease, many thousands might die. On 13 March, Sir Patrick stated that about 60% of the population would need to become infected for society to have ""herd immunity"" - effectively some 40 million people in the UK. ""Communities will become immune to it and that's going to be an important part of controlling this longer term,"" he told Sky News. These comments sparked an immediate backlash. Anthony Costello, professor of health and sustainable development at University College London and a former director of maternal and child health at the WHO, tweeted: ""Is it ethical to adopt a policy that threatens immediate casualties on the basis of an uncertain future benefit?"" And Dr Margaret Harris from the WHO told the BBC's Today programme on 14 March: ""We don't know enough about the science of this virus. We can talk theories, but at the moment we are really facing a situation where we have got to look at action."" That day, more than 200 scientists - ranging from experts in mathematics to genetics - signed an open letter to the government urging it to introduce tougher measures to tackle the spread of Covid-19. ""We consider the social distancing measures taken as of today as insufficient, and we believe that additional and more restrictive measures should be taken immediately."" The government tried to play down the words that had sparked the furore. A spokesman for the Department of Health and Social Care said Sir Patrick's comments had been misinterpreted. ""Herd immunity is not part of our action plan but is a natural by-product of an epidemic,"" he said. That same evening, the Telegraph website published an article by the Health Secretary Matt Hancock. ""We have a plan, based on the expertise of world-leading scientists. Herd immunity is not a part of it. That is a scientific concept, not a goal or a strategy."" On Sunday 15 March, the health secretary appeared on the BBC's Andrew Marr and Sky's Sophy Ridge programmes, restating that herd immunity was not the government's policy. The Telegraph website said the government had appeared to ""U-turn on the idea"". The Express said herd immunity had been abandoned after ""a huge backlash"". But despite repeated government denials, the BBC has learned that on 13 March, when Sir Patrick Vallance was outlining the government's approach to tackling the virus, herd immunity was being discussed at the heart of the health service. From the start of the outbreak, Simon Enright, director for communications for NHS England and NHS Improvement, would offer weekly briefings to media teams in other health organisations and medical royal colleges. He and his team would share some of the latest information on strategy and thinking. The BBC has seen contemporaneous notes from the meetings and spoken to people on the calls. At the meeting on 13 March, Mr Enright is said to have relayed information from the government's top scientific and medical advisers. The notes say the communications chief shared NHS England's own advice on holding internal work events, but say ""we are not telling you what to do"". ""We want people to be infected with Covid-19,"" the notes say. ""The best way of managing it is herd immunity and protect the vulnerable."" Mr Enright was clear where the idea had come from, according to the notes. It was on the ""direct advice"" of the chief medical adviser and chief scientific adviser. NHS England had cancelled one of its own events but only so staff could be retained to work on the coronavirus response, according to the notes. ""In other words - if you cancel events to stop people coming out of service that's fine, but don't cancel because of risk of infection."" NHS England says Mr Enright was paraphrasing what he had heard Vallance say on the Today programme that morning, and other comments made in the press briefings and interviews. Panorama - Britain's Coronavirus Gamble Panorama investigates the scientific advice the government followed in the early stages of the coronavirus pandemic. Broadcast 19:30, Monday 20 July 2020 on BBC One ""This is chaos,"" says Richard Horton, editor of the medical journal The Lancet, who has criticised what he sees as the failure to heed early warnings from China. ""This is no way to manage a pandemic. ""What it shows is that at the heart of the government's response there was no clear command-and-control structure as to how we were going to manage this outbreak. ""It's very important to get these facts on the record about herd immunity, because history is being rewritten at the moment and herd immunity is being written out of the history."" A government spokesperson said: ""This is a new virus and an unprecedented global pandemic, and our strategy to protect, delay, contain, research and mitigate was clear from the outset. It is categorically wrong to suggest herd immunity was the government's aim."" Some critics believe it is problematic if herd immunity was part of the government's thinking at the time. Sir David King, former chief scientific adviser to the government between 2000 and 2007, has been a vocal critic of the UK government's efforts to fight coronavirus. ""I can only give you one rational explanation for this tragedy and that is that they had decided to go for herd immunity. We did hear the phrase 'herd immunity', although the government subsequently somehow denied that they were doing that."" There are plenty of experts who now believe an earlier lockdown would have saved lives. Prof Neil Ferguson, an epidemiologist and former government adviser, told a committee of MPs on 10 June the number of coronavirus deaths could have been halved if lockdown had been introduced only a week earlier. But the prime minister responded to Prof Ferguson's comments hours later at the No 10 press conference that day, saying it was ""simply too early to judge ourselves"". ""We made the decisions at the time on the guidance of Sage [the government's scientific advisory group], including Prof Ferguson, that we thought were right for this country,"" he said. The BBC has spent months speaking to more than a dozen scientists advising the government on its response to the outbreak to try to find out just how important the concept of herd immunity was to the scientific thinking that drove government strategy at the beginning of the outbreak. Some of Sage's papers model different ways of responding to the outbreak. Two of the options when responding to a disease like Covid-19 are known as suppression and mitigation, according to Dr Thomas House, a statistician from the University of Manchester and a member of the modelling group (SPI-M) that feeds into Sage. Suppression, he says, aims to reduce infections to zero, while mitigation accepts the inevitability of an outbreak and concentrates efforts on minimising suffering. ""If a tsunami is coming we don't try to stop the tsunami, we just try to ensure that the minimum number of people are harmed by it."" ""Herd immunity was on the table,"" says Prof Ian Hall, an epidemiologist, head of the University of Manchester modelling team, and a member SPI-M who has also attended multiple Sage meetings. He described it ""as a concept"", a technical term typically used when discussing the spread of disease. Dr Hall says SPI-M discussed a range of options to be able to prevent the NHS being overwhelmed and buy it time to prepare, while the population achieved ""some sort of herd immunity"". Herd immunity can be achieved by an uncontrolled spread of infection which can happen quickly, but that would overwhelm the NHS. Hall says this was never realistic because the government would always act to reduce the number of deaths. But it can also be achieved by measures to mitigate the disease which look to protect lives, in the absence of any vaccine, and build up immunity over a long time. Jeremy Hunt, chairman of the health and social care select committee, has criticised the scientific advice at the start of the pandemic, calling it ""wrong"". ""Ministers were given the choice of extreme lockdown or mitigated herd immunity,"" he recently told the Times newspaper. He said that Sage did not model the adoption of a testing regime used in previous coronavirus outbreaks in East Asia. ""We were unfortunately following a flu policy, not Sars (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome)."" The government has spent much of the past decade preparing for a flu pandemic - something consistently rated the number one natural hazard threat on the National Risk Register of Civil Emergencies. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise HOPE AND LOSS:Your coronavirus stories LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash Edinburgh Medical School professor of global public health Devi Sridhar says the 2011 flu plan - which still forms the basis of a planned response to such a pandemic - appears primarily concerned with mitigating the impact of the virus. ""This was very much the view that you could not control or contain this outbreak,"" she says. ""[The virus is] going to run through, it's inevitable, it's unstoppable."" Sridhar, who is also a member of the Scottish government's Covid-19 advisory group, says the initial UK response looked like it was ""largely out of the 'flu playbook'"". ""It was the idea that you don't want to disrupt people's lives. You want to keep things moving but you have to mitigate or take care of the health consequences as it flows through."" Dr Hall remembers the moment he began to question how close the UK was to emulating scenes in Italy. He and a team at the University of Manchester had spent weeks hunched over laptops modelling how the disease might spread in the UK. In mid-March, he was approached by some Chinese students at the university demanding to know why the UK was not acting faster, in line with the Chinese government's response. Dr Hall told them that scientists were not sure that transmission of the disease would be similar in the UK because of differences between the two countries. But the students' questioning got him and the team thinking. Scientists had agreed the amount of time it was taking for infections to double was between five and six days, in a Sage consensus statement on 16 March. But the Manchester team were concerned it could be much shorter, and the virus was spreading more rapidly. After days of scrutinising data, Hall and the team found that the total number of positive swabs in Italy and the UK were doubling much faster, closer to every three days. They presented this to SPI-M on 20 March. The NHS was now just 14 days from being overwhelmed, according to their projections. It took another three days for SPI-M modelling groups across the country, working with different data, to agree. In the meantime, infections were rising exponentially, meaning every day was critical. On 16 March, a crucial report was published by a team from Imperial College led by Prof Ferguson. It looked at three scenarios: doing nothing and letting the virus spread a mitigated approach where the spread of the disease was accepted but measures were taken to slow it Suppression, effectively trying to stop the epidemic in its tracks, and bringing cases down as low as possible In the first scenario the modelling projected 500,000 dead, but even in the mitigated approach potential deaths were estimated at 250,000 with the NHS being completely overwhelmed. Over the next seven days after the release of the report, an escalating series of actions was taken. On 16 March the government set out its social distancing policy, on 18 March it announced schools would be closed and on 20 March pubs, bars, cafes, restaurants, clubs, theatres, cinemas and gyms were all closed with immediate effect. Then on 23 March full lockdown was announced in an address to the nation by Boris Johnson. Non-essential shops were closed and people were ordered to stay home. And yet Prof Ferguson says he had already provided the government by early March with estimations of the likely number of deaths if a mitigation strategy was pursued - at least 305,000. This was revised down to 250,000 in the report he published on the 16 March but the NHS would still be over capacity. ""Our projections of the potential health impact of the pandemic were known from about 5 March onwards,"" he says. They were ""actively discussed"" within government, he adds. Prof Ferguson says he told Sage the findings were his best estimate of what was most likely to happen. He says other scientists had reached similar conclusions too. But Sage only considered these a reasonable worst-case scenario - of the kind used by the government to plan for a range of eventualities - and not a forecast of what was most likely to happen. Regent Street, London. April 4, 2020 There were other early voices providing key pieces of information in that time. The BBC has been told that NHS England's medical director Stephen Powis informed Sage as early as 13 March that projections predicted the NHS would not have capacity to cope under a strategy which looked only to mitigate the spread of the virus and not suppress it. ""If that result was known on 5 March that's devastating,"" says Richard Horton. ""We wasted over two weeks when the virus was exponentially growing through communities up and down the country."" ""This information should have been publicly available to be scrutinised by other experts so that we could have had a public discussion and built public support for an early lockdown."" Scenes of hospitals being overwhelmed, such as those in northern Italy, were never replicated in the UK. But in March, the virus was spreading inside care homes. The need to ""protect the vulnerable"" had been mentioned repeatedly by the government and its advisers. Graham Medley, chairman of SPI-M, gave an illustration of the challenges of delivering this when explaining herd immunity on BBC's Newsnight on 12 March. He argued that theoretically - although impractically - one way to achieve it would be to move all vulnerable people to the north of Scotland, and the rest of the population to Kent. That way ""a nice big epidemic"" in Kent would allow herd immunity and the re-mixing of the entire country again, he said. ""We can't do that, so what we're going to have to try and do, ideally, is manage this acquisition of herd immunity and minimise this exposure of people who are vulnerable."" Dr Hall, co-chair of the Sage group advising on care homes, told the BBC that forecasts of the spread of infections in care homes were not conducted until early April. It was not done previously because of a lack of data on the outbreak in care homes. ""We didn't see the care home outbreaks back in March arising,"" he says. Dr Hall says the links and infection risk between care homes, hospitals and the community were not well documented. ""I didn't appreciate personally the level of the amount of staff that move between care homes and the potential for staff to introduce disease,"" he says. Health Secretary Matt Hancock has on many occasions defended the government's handling of the outbreak in care homes, insisting that from the beginning it had tried to throw a ""protective ring"" around them. Four months on from the introduction of the lockdown, scientists remain unsure how long any immunity from coronavirus might last. No-one knows when an effective vaccine will come. But Dr Hall says the UK's response will ultimately end with herd immunity. ""Without a vaccine we will go on with transmissions at a relatively low level hopefully and with contact tracing and all the other interventions to mitigate the disease, we will eventually achieve herd immunity one way or another."" But that could take years. For Prof Ferguson, the issue with the suppression strategy is it leaves many countries without a long-term exit plan and ""stuck in the same policy"" until a vaccine is found. The fear is that as soon as restrictions are lifted, the virus will return across borders. Only very few countries, such as New Zealand and Taiwan, have come close to eliminating the virus, he said. Questions about the timing of policy decisions and the scientific advice that guided the response may take some time to answer. The prime minister recently committed to an inquiry, but no timeframe has been given. Sir Patrick told a Commons science committee on 16 July that it was ""clear that the outcome has not been good in the UK"". He said that there were many factors to be considered when determining how a country has responded to the outbreak. ""There will be decisions made that will turn out not to have been the right decisions at the time,"" he said. Sir David King says that, ""When it comes to the inquiry, the politicians will say, 'We were just following the scientific advice.'"" But King, like many of the scientists we spoke to, complains that this suggests there is one definitive view. These scientists point out that there are differing views and the government's actions are ultimately based on political decisions. The Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, Health Secretary Matt Hancock, chief medical adviser Prof Chris Whitty and chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance declined to give an interview. A government spokesperson told the BBC: ""At every stage, we have been guided by the advice of experts from Sage and its subcommittees, and our response ensured the NHS was not overwhelmed even at the virus' peak, so that everyone was always able to get the best possible care."" But for the critics the danger is a second wave of infections will come without lessons having been learnt from the first. Â© 2025 BBC.

"John David Washington stars in Tenet alongside Elizabeth Debicki (seated) Warner Bros has said it is delaying the release of Christopher Nolan's latest movie Tenet again due to the coronavirus pandemic. The fantasy spy epic was originally set to debut on 17 July but this was pushed back to 12 August. Tenet was expected to be the first big-budget Hollywood film to be released in US cinemas during the summer. But the studio said it would be re-evaluating its release date ""amidst all this continued uncertainty."" It also suggested that it might consider releasing the film in overseas markets before the US. ""We are not treating Tenet like a traditional global day-and-date release, and our upcoming marketing and distribution plans will reflect that,"" said Toby Emmerich, chairman of the studio's Pictures Group. Mr Emmerich said that a release date would be shared ""imminently."" Allow YouTube content? This article contains content provided by Google YouTube.

Tenet focuses on a protagonist, played by John David Washington, trying to save the world from disaster. Its other stars include Robert Pattinson and Sir Kenneth Branagh. British director Christopher Nolan's other films include Inception, Interstellar and the Oscar-winning World War II film Dunkirk. He also directed the three films in the so-called Dark Knight trilogy - Batman Begins, The Dark Knight and The Dark Knight Rises. The delay of Tenet's release comes as coronavirus shutdowns continue to devastate the film industry. The black man who took on the Klan In the face of rising infections and deaths, cinemas in New York City and Los Angeles, two of the biggest markets in America, still do not have permission from city authorities to open. Cinemas in China - one of the world's largest box-office markets - reopened on Monday for the first time in six months, though strict rules are in place which limit their capacity. In light of the pandemic, several studios have postponed the filming and release of movies, including Disney's live-action remake of Mulan, which is now set for release on 21 August. But while some distributors have shifted to on-demand releases, Tenet is one of several big-budget films that have been delayed to ensure a full theatrical release.

"Rideshare drivers in LA are among those protesting Protesters in Kentucky are on hunger strike demanding justice for Breonna Taylor, a black woman killed by police in her home in March. The strike comes as thousands of US workers walk off the job on Monday to protest racism, inequality and police brutality. The Strike for Black Lives builds the country-wide protests over the death of a black man, George Floyd, in May. Many of the striking workers are considered ""essential"" in the pandemic. Organisers said tens of thousands of workers in at least 25 cities were predicted to protest for at least part of the work day on Monday. Those unable to leave the job for the entire day are instead holding lunchtime rallies and kneeling for eight minutes and 46 seconds - the time that Minneapolis prosecutors initially said that ex-Officer Derek Chauvin knelt on Floyd's neck, allegedly killing him. Protesters in New York City held a rally outside Trump Tower Four hunger strikers in Louisville, Kentucky, are demanding that two city officers involved in Taylor's death - Sgt John Mattingly and Detective Myles Cosgrove - be fired and stripped of their pensions. Ex-Detective Brett Hankison, who was also involved in a raid on Taylor's apartment in March, was fired but is appealing the decision. The four strikers are also live-streaming their strike on their Facebook page, Hunger Strikers for Breonna. ""In this form, we can control it,"" one participant, Ari Maybe, told the Courier Journal, adding that the strike will take place on private property. The hunger strikers in Louisville are calling for the police involved in Ms Taylor's death to be fired ""It's not like a sit-in, where we can be arrested. It's not like a protest, where there's a beginning and an end. We control the beginning, the end and the entire narrative."" She added that in addition to the four people involved, they have support from around 35 others, including medical personnel and a crew responsible for the Facebook stream. Why Breonna Taylor's name is chanted at demos What's changed since George Floyd's death? Fast-food servers, healthcare workers, ride-share drivers, airport workers, cleaning staff and workers from many other industries are taking part in a larger, separate national day of protest, which brings together a coalition of labour unions and social justice organisations. The strikers are calling for lawmakers to create equal opportunities for racial minorities and for corporations to take stronger action to support civil rights. The diverse group is calling for higher wages for all workers as well as better healthcare access, sick leave, and child support among other demands. Protesters outside the capitol building in Washington call for a second stimulus bill The airport in Minneapolis, where George Floyd died in police custody, was also the scene of protests In Manhattan, workers are protesting outside Trump Tower, calling for Republicans to approve the Heroes Act, a second economic stimulus bill that has already been approved by the Democratic-led House of Representatives. In Missouri, protesters gathered at a McDonald's restaurant, then marched to a memorial for Michael Brown, a black teenager who was killed by police in Ferguson, Missouri, in 2014. In Los Angeles, workers led a ""car caravan"" to the University of Southern California to ""demand the nation's second-largest school district and the university drop their use of the [Los Angeles Police Department] on campuses"", according to a press release. Police had suspected Taylor's flat was being used to receive drugs by a gang based at a different address 10 miles (16km) away. One of the suspects was an ex-boyfriend of Taylor. Shortly after midnight on 13 March, officers Hankison, Mattingly and Cosgrove stormed Taylor's apartment by executing a no-knock search warrant - a court document that authorises police to enter a home without permission. Taylor and her partner, Kenneth Walker, were reportedly asleep as the commotion began. Police said they knocked before using a battering ram to enter the home, though this account has been disputed by Taylor's family and a neighbour. Breonna Taylor, 26, was a decorated emergency medical technician The officers exchanged fire with Mr Walker, a licensed gun owner who called 911 in the belief that the drug raid was a burglary. The officers - who fired more than 25 bullets - said they returned fire after one officer was shot and wounded. During the exchange, Taylor, an emergency medical technician, was shot eight times. She died on her hallway floor. She was 26 years old. Mr Walker surrendered and was arrested on charges of attempted murder of a police officer, but officials have since motioned to drop the charge. Taylor was one of three people named on the warrant,according to Louisville NBC affiliate Wave 3,external. But she was not the main subject of the investigation,the city's Courier-Journal newspaper reports,external. No drugs were found in the property. Timeline of US police killings Police officer Brett Hankison was accused of ""blindly"" firing 10 rounds into the apartment, displaying ""an extreme indifference to the value of human life"". Brett Hankison showed 'extreme indifference to the value of human life' A lawsuit filed by Taylor's family accuses the officers of battery, wrongful death, excessive force and gross negligence. According to the family, Taylor took ""five to six minutes"" to die from her injuries and did not receive urgent medical care from officers at the scene.

"Sitel said it was ""urgently investigating"" the outbreak with Public Health Scotland Six people have tested positive for coronavirus in an outbreak at a test and trace call centre in North Lanarkshire. Sitel, which carries out contact tracing for NHS England, said it was aware of a ""local outbreak"" at its Motherwell site. Deputy First Minister John Swinney toldBBC Radio's Good Morning Scotlandthe call centre has been closed. He said ""extensive contact tracing"" was under way. Sitel said it was ""urgently investigating"" the outbreak with Public Health Scotland. The company said it had requested that all staff who have been working at the site undergo testing within the next 24 hours. A spokeswoman for NHS Test and Trace said everyone at the site is currently working from home while a deep clean takes place. NHS Test and Trace is a service operated by the NHS in England to track and help prevent the spread of Covid-19 south of the border. Coronavirus in Scotland: How many cases are there? What can I now do - and what are the rules? Mr Swinney told the BBC that the situation came to light at 08:00 on Sunday and since then a number of contacts of the people who tested positive have been identified. It was a ""pretty realistic conclusion"" that there had been transmission of the virus in the office, he added - but an investigation into how it spread is being carried out. Mr Swinney also said work would need to be undertaken to ""get an understanding"" of how guidance was being followed within the facility. When asked if penalties could levied against Sitel, Mr Swinney said: ""These are all issues that will be explored, but what our primary focus is on is to make sure that we interrupt any transmission of the virus. ""The virus is at a very low level within Scottish society today, the compliance efforts of members of the public have successfully reduced the prevalence of coronavirus, but we have to keep it that way."" Mr Swinney added that actions being taken by NHS Lanarkshire and North Lanarkshire Council were ""reassuring"". The outbreak involves a call centre which carries out coronavirus contact tracing Concerns had been raised after 23 new cases of Covid-19 in Scotland were announced on Sunday, although only three of these were in the Lanarkshire health board area. This followed 21 cases being confirmed on Saturday, with both of these figures the highest recorded since mid-June. However the number of new positive test results dropped back to seven on Monday, with First Minister Nicola Sturgeon welcoming ""a reduction compared to recent days"". She said all cases ""will still be closely examined and contract tracing undertaken as appropriate"". Dr David Crome, a consultant in public health medicine at NHS Lanarkshire, said the health board was investigating the situation and putting measures in place to reduce risk. The Scottish government said contact tracing is under way following the detection of ""a small number of potentially linked cases in North Lanarkshire"". ""Where potential clusters of cases develop we must find them and act quickly to prevent further spread and we are grateful to local partners for their swift response,"" a spokesman said. The spokesman said ""a small increase in the number of cases is not unexpected as lockdown is lifted"", adding that it highlights the importance of the public co-operating with contact tracers as well as following guidelines on social distancing and wearing face coverings.

"This video can not be played Highlights as Ben Stokes impresses in Englandâs second Test victory over the West Indies Second Test, Emirates Old Trafford (day four of five) England 469-9 dec(Stokes 176, Sibley 120)& 129-3 dec(Stokes 78*) West Indies 287(Brathwaite 75)& 198(Brooks 62, Broad 3-42) England won by 113 runs; series level at 1-1 Scorecard Ben Stokes and Stuart Broad again provided the inspiration for England to complete a series-levelling 113-run victory over West Indies in the second Test at Emirates Old Trafford. Stokes cracked 78 not out from 57 balls to allow England to declare on 129-3, setting West Indies 312 to win or 85 overs to survive. Broad took 3-1 on the fourth evening and tore through the top order with three more wickets on Monday to leave West Indies 37-4. Their recovery came in the shape of a century partnership between Jermaine Blackwood and Shamarh Brooks, who both made fifties. Stokes produced the breakthrough, having the tangled Blackwood top-edge a pull to a diving Jos Buttler in a sustained spell of short bowling. Further resistance came from West Indies captain Jason Holder but, when he was bowled by Dom Bess, England could scent victory. The win was completed with nearly 15 overs to spare, Bess having Kemar Roach caught at short leg to leave West Indies 198 all out and the series level at 1-1. The only concern for England was the sight of Stokes pulling up mid-over, appearing to hold his groin, late in the day, but he said there are no concerns over his availability for the third and final Test beginning on Friday at the same ground. 'Stokes is Mr Incredible - we are in the presence of greatness' Stokes 'absolutely fine' after injury scare Watch Today at the Test on iPlayer TMS podcast: England level the series This video can not be played Pope's brilliant catch seals victory for England Despite the surreal behind-closed-doors environment, this series has served up two superb finishes - West Indies' run-chase in Southampton and England's race against time in Manchester. In order to level the series, England produced an excellent performance, overcoming the disruption caused byJofra Archer's breachof the bio-secure protocols, being asked to bat in difficult conditions on day one and the obstacle of the entire third day being lost to rain. In doing so, they have set up an intriguing finale when they will look win back the Wisden Trophy, defend a six-year unbeaten home record and prevent a first West Indies series win here since 1988. They face decisions, especially around the make-up of a pace attack that has been rotated. Do they retain any of Broad, Chris Woakes and Sam Curran, or recall Archer and either of rested pair James Anderson and Mark Wood? Will off-spinner Bess make way for Jack Leach? Can West Indies, an hour away from earning the draw that would have guaranteed a share of the series, stir themselves to ensure they do not end their tour empty handed? The suspicion is that England have the momentum, and they will have been relieved when Stokes explained that his discomfort was only a result of stiffness from his exertions in this match. This video can not be played Serious commitment - Stokes sprints to save boundary off own bowling Stokes and Broad have combined to engineer this victory one match after Stokes, as stand-in captain, was part of the decision to omit Broad for the first Test, leaving the pace bowler""angry, frustrated and gutted"". While Broad responded with a reminder of his enduring quality, Stokes produced another sensational all-round display. With England resuming on 37-2 and looking for quick runs on the final morning, Stokes - on 16 after opening the batting - signalled his intent with a glorious loft over long-off for six off pace bowler Roach in the first over. This video can not be played Stokes smashes quickfire 78 for England Let off on 29 when John Campbell dropped a simple chance at deep cover, Stokes moved to 50 from 36 balls - the fastest half-century in Tests by an England opener - and took his match tally to 254 runs after his careful 176 in the first innings. Broad's burst revived England on Sunday, and he picked up where he left off, nipping the ball in to the right-handers from a full length, endangering pads and stumps. When England were held up, Stokes produced another Herculean spell of 11 overs to open the door, and the hosts chipped away from there. West Indies have been determined with the bat throughout the series, and their spirit almost ensured they escaped this match with a draw. After 15 overs, they were in disarray. Campbell played an awful drive to be caught behind, Shai Hope was bowled by one that nipped back and Roston Chase was lbw shouldering arms, all to Broad. Kraigg Brathwaite was stuck on the crease to be leg before to Woakes. However, Blackwood rescued West Indies from 27-3 in Southampton and he counter-attacked here. Brooks was more circumspect, but also hit Bess for two straight sixes. This video can not be played Stokes makes the breakthrough with the wicket of Blackwood They were parted when Blackwood flapped at Stokes, Buttler taking a wonderful catch, and after Shane Dowrich and Brooks were leg before to Woakes and Curran respectively, only Holder and the tail remained. Bess had endured a frustrating afternoon, but two balls after he was launched for a straight six by Holder, he fizzed a quicker ball through the captain's defence. Stokes had Alzarri Joseph held at point by Bess before hobbling to his fielding position in the slips midway through an over, leaving Bess to take the final wicket. Player of the match Ben Stokes on BBC Test Match Special:""To come here after a disappointing loss in Southampton, to perform like we did here, especially with rain, shows we are capable of putting in performances like this. It can be driving force for us."" ""The way we bowled all day was unbelievable. The way Broady has come back has been absolutely awesome. Everyone has put their hands up and contributed to a great win."" England captain Joe Root on BBC Test Match Special:""Ben keeps developing his game and improving all the time. Credit to him - he really has taken every opportunity to make himself a better player. ""Throughout the game you've seen how destructive he can be when he needs to be, and when he needs to bat time and play to the situation, he can do that too."" Former England captain Michael Vaughan:""This kind of performance by England is what I expected a week ago. For whatever reason last week they didn't arrive with the bat in hand."" Ex-England captain Alastair Cook:""England will be pleased with how they batted here. They dug in and learnt the lesson of going big. You don't lose many games when you get 450. ""England will go into Friday with a lot of confidence."" West Indies captain Jason Holder:""I'm a little disappointed with the way we batted. Yesterday's evening batting performance really set us back. ""We need a few more of those starts and capitalising on certain moments in the game. We just have to tighten up a little more.

"Rideshare drivers in LA are among those protesting Protesters in Kentucky are on hunger strike demanding justice for Breonna Taylor, a black woman killed by police in her home in March. The strike comes as thousands of US workers walk off the job on Monday to protest racism, inequality and police brutality. The Strike for Black Lives builds the country-wide protests over the death of a black man, George Floyd, in May. Many of the striking workers are considered ""essential"" in the pandemic. Organisers said tens of thousands of workers in at least 25 cities were predicted to protest for at least part of the work day on Monday. Those unable to leave the job for the entire day are instead holding lunchtime rallies and kneeling for eight minutes and 46 seconds - the time that Minneapolis prosecutors initially said that ex-Officer Derek Chauvin knelt on Floyd's neck, allegedly killing him. Protesters in New York City held a rally outside Trump Tower Four hunger strikers in Louisville, Kentucky, are demanding that two city officers involved in Taylor's death - Sgt John Mattingly and Detective Myles Cosgrove - be fired and stripped of their pensions. Ex-Detective Brett Hankison, who was also involved in a raid on Taylor's apartment in March, was fired but is appealing the decision. The four strikers are also live-streaming their strike on their Facebook page, Hunger Strikers for Breonna. ""In this form, we can control it,"" one participant, Ari Maybe, told the Courier Journal, adding that the strike will take place on private property. The hunger strikers in Louisville are calling for the police involved in Ms Taylor's death to be fired ""It's not like a sit-in, where we can be arrested. It's not like a protest, where there's a beginning and an end. We control the beginning, the end and the entire narrative."" She added that in addition to the four people involved, they have support from around 35 others, including medical personnel and a crew responsible for the Facebook stream. Why Breonna Taylor's name is chanted at demos What's changed since George Floyd's death? Fast-food servers, healthcare workers, ride-share drivers, airport workers, cleaning staff and workers from many other industries are taking part in a larger, separate national day of protest, which brings together a coalition of labour unions and social justice organisations. The strikers are calling for lawmakers to create equal opportunities for racial minorities and for corporations to take stronger action to support civil rights. The diverse group is calling for higher wages for all workers as well as better healthcare access, sick leave, and child support among other demands. Protesters outside the capitol building in Washington call for a second stimulus bill The airport in Minneapolis, where George Floyd died in police custody, was also the scene of protests In Manhattan, workers are protesting outside Trump Tower, calling for Republicans to approve the Heroes Act, a second economic stimulus bill that has already been approved by the Democratic-led House of Representatives. In Missouri, protesters gathered at a McDonald's restaurant, then marched to a memorial for Michael Brown, a black teenager who was killed by police in Ferguson, Missouri, in 2014. In Los Angeles, workers led a ""car caravan"" to the University of Southern California to ""demand the nation's second-largest school district and the university drop their use of the [Los Angeles Police Department] on campuses"", according to a press release. Police had suspected Taylor's flat was being used to receive drugs by a gang based at a different address 10 miles (16km) away. One of the suspects was an ex-boyfriend of Taylor. Shortly after midnight on 13 March, officers Hankison, Mattingly and Cosgrove stormed Taylor's apartment by executing a no-knock search warrant - a court document that authorises police to enter a home without permission. Taylor and her partner, Kenneth Walker, were reportedly asleep as the commotion began. Police said they knocked before using a battering ram to enter the home, though this account has been disputed by Taylor's family and a neighbour. Breonna Taylor, 26, was a decorated emergency medical technician The officers exchanged fire with Mr Walker, a licensed gun owner who called 911 in the belief that the drug raid was a burglary. The officers - who fired more than 25 bullets - said they returned fire after one officer was shot and wounded. During the exchange, Taylor, an emergency medical technician, was shot eight times. She died on her hallway floor. She was 26 years old. Mr Walker surrendered and was arrested on charges of attempted murder of a police officer, but officials have since motioned to drop the charge. Taylor was one of three people named on the warrant,according to Louisville NBC affiliate Wave 3,external. But she was not the main subject of the investigation,the city's Courier-Journal newspaper reports,external. No drugs were found in the property. Timeline of US police killings Police officer Brett Hankison was accused of ""blindly"" firing 10 rounds into the apartment, displaying ""an extreme indifference to the value of human life"". Brett Hankison showed 'extreme indifference to the value of human life' A lawsuit filed by Taylor's family accuses the officers of battery, wrongful death, excessive force and gross negligence. According to the family, Taylor took ""five to six minutes"" to die from her injuries and did not receive urgent medical care from officers at the scene.

"This video can not be played Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab warns Beijing: ""The UK is watching and the whole world is watchingâ The UK government will suspend its extradition treaty with Hong Kong ""immediately and indefinitely"". Announcing the move, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the UK ""wants a positive relationship"" with China. But he said the ""imposition"" of the newsecurity lawin Hong Kong by Beijing was a ""serious violation"" of the country's international obligations. Labour said it would support changes to the law, calling it a ""step in the right direction"". The extradition treaty means that, if someone in Hong Kong is suspected of a crime in the UK, then the British authorities can ask Hong Kong to hand them over to face justice - and vice versa. The UK fears the arrangement - which has been in place for more than 30 years - could see anyone it extradites to Hong Kong being sent on to China. Why are the UK and China arguing about Hong Kong? UK makes citizenship offer to Hong Kong residents China's new law: Why is Hong Kong worried? Mr Raab also confirmed the government would extend its arms embargo - which has been in place with China since 1989 - to Hong Kong, stopping the UK exporting equipment, such as firearms, smoke grenades and shackles, to the region. But China has accused the UK government of ""brutal meddling"", insisting it is committed to upholding international law. The country also promised a ""resolute response"" if the UK withdrew from extradition arrangements. Beijing introduced the security law at the end of June, creating new offences which could see Hong Kong residents sent to mainland China for trial. Critics said it could see pro-democracy protesters in the region being served with life sentences. They have also said the law breaches an agreement made with the UK before Hong Kong - a former British colony - was handed over to China in 1997. Under the 50-year agreement, China enshrined civil liberties - including the right to protest, freedom of speech and the independence of the judiciary - in Hong Kong's Basic Law, an approach which came to be known as ""one country, two systems"". Mr Raab told MPs: ""There remains considerable uncertainty about the way in which the new national security law will be enforced. ""I would just say this: the UK is watching and the whole world is watching."" The foreign secretary also confirmed plans for a path to UK citizenship for around three million Hong Kong people would be in place by early 2021, in response to the law. However, Border Force officials have been given the ability to grant leave to any applicants before then. This video can not be played Tea, drugs and war: Hong Kong's British history explained Political and economic relations between the UK and China have become strained in recent months. Mr Raab referenced a number of tensions during his speech, including the decision by the UK government toban Chinese firm Huawei from the country's 5G network.,external He told MPs: ""We will always protect our vital interests including sensitive infrastructure and we won't accept any investment that compromises our domestic or national security"" The foreign secretary also raised his ""grave concerns"" about the ""gross human rights abuses"" taking place in China's Xinjiang region against Uighur Muslims, afterreports of forced sterilisation and wider persecutionof the group. He said they had raised the issue with his Chinese counterparts and with the United Nations. Mr Raab added: ""We want a positive relationship with China. There's a huge amount to be gained for both countries, there are many areas, where we can work productively, constructively to mutual benefit together. ""For our part, the UK will work hard and in good faith towards that goal. But we will protect our vital interests, we will stand up for our values, and we will hold China to its international obligations."" This video can not be played China's ambassador to the UK, Liu Xiaoming, denied reports of a ""concentration camp"" in Xinjiang The change in the treaty was praised by MPs from other parties. Shadow foreign secretary Lisa Nandy said Labour ""strongly welcomed"" the measures, adding they should lead to a ""new era"" in the two countries' relationship. ""This must mark the start of a more strategic approach to China based on an ethical approach to foreign policy and an end to the naivety of the 'golden-era years',"" she told MPs. ""Our quarrel is not with the people of China, but the erosion of freedoms in Hong Kong, the actions of the Chinese government in the South China Sea and the appalling treatment of the Uighur people is reason now to act. ""We will not be able to say in future years that we did not know."" But other MPs called for the government to go further. Liberal Democrat MP Alistair Carmichael wanted action on imports from China - especially surveillance equipment - while the SNP's Margaret Ferrier called for sanctions against individuals responsible for human rights violations. Conservative MPs also called for further action. Tory MP and former defence minister Tobias Ellwood said: ""For decades we have turned a blind eye to China's democratic deficit and human rights violations in the hope that it would mature into a global, responsible citizen [but] that clearly hasn't happened. ""Can I ask the secretary of state, is this now the turning point that we drop the pretence the China shares our values, given its actions... [and] can we have a strategic overhaul of our foreign policy in relation to China?"" Mr Raab said the government was carrying out an integrated review about its strategy.

"Delivery giant Hermes says it will create 10,500 jobs in the UK after seeing a surge in demand from people shopping from home during lockdown. This will include 1,500 full-time roles across its delivery network and head office, and 9,000 freelance couriers. Hermes also said it would not accept any money from the government's job retention bonus scheme, designed to help struggling firms. It comes as a raft of companies make job cuts due to the pandemic. Hermes boss Martijn de Lange said: ""The pandemic has expedited the already phenomenal growth of online shopping and we see no sign of this changing. ""As a result, it is important that we have the right infrastructure and people in place to support this. This is good news for the many people who have sadly had their income affected and we are pleased to be able to support the UK economy with so many jobs at this time."" He said the firm had received thousands of applications from pub staff, hairdressers, pilots and others who had been let go at the start of lockdown. 'Ground-breaking' pay deal for Hermes staff The German firm, which has operated in the UK since 2000, has a network of more than 15,000 self-employed couriers in the country. It said it was investing Â£100m in its expansion and had already opened 90 new sub depots this year. Hermes follows Primark, John Lewis and Rightmove in promising to shun the government's job retention bonus scheme, which will pay firms Â£1,000 for every furloughed worker they retain past January. It is meant to stop struggling firms from cutting jobs, but MPs and economists have warned that healthy companies could also be tempted to use it. Hermes, which has been criticised for its treatment of casual workers in the past, also said that all new self-employed hires would get holiday pay. It follows a deal with the GMB union last year. The jobs news comes after a raft of companies have announced cuts citing the effects of the pandemic. On Tuesday, Marks & Spencer and fashion brand Ted Bakersaid they would slash almost 1,500 roles between them.

Car parks and paths reopened in Snowdonia on 6 July to visitors for the first time after the stay local travel restrictions were lifted. On Sunday, pictures were shared on social media of cars parked along the side of the mountain road, as people flocked to hike to the highest peak in Wales.

And by 08:16 BST on Monday, the Pen-y-Pass car park, the closest car park to the summit of Snowdon, in Gwynedd, was again full. Nia Jefferies, who had cycled from nearby Porthmadog on Sunday, said it was ""frightening"" as people had parked on bends, turning it into a ""single track"". ""There were walkers there, motorbikes there, cyclists and big campervans, and it was down to single file,"" the Gwynedd councillor said.

Mess left at beauty spots 'unacceptable' Cardiff Bay police warning after 'unsavoury scenes' Ms Jefferies said while business owners were desperate for tourists to return to the area, people needed to respect the national park and think about the consequences of their actions. ""We are lucky we have the scenery, I know lockdown has been hard for people living in cities, but people are not respecting the environment or other people,"" she said. ""It was just so haphazard, fancy stopping on a mountain on a bend, and not thinking about the consequences, and just going for a walk, it's so selfish."" Tickets have been issued to some cars Plaid Cymru politicians said the scenes were ""truly shocking"" and called for a park and ride scheme to be brought in urgently. ""Nothing can excuse the behaviour of those who wantonly abandoned their vehicles on an exceptionally busy stretch of the A4086,"" they said in a statement. ""What events over the weekend underscored is that we cannot wait any longer for a lasting solution to this problem."" Snowdonia National Park Authority, Gwynedd and Conwy councils have been reviewing parking and transport for the area. Ms Jefferies said having a park and ride service could be a solution, to get people to spend in villages and towns, or passes for local residents. In Barmouth, Gwynedd, the RNLI said people had parked outside the lifeboat station, blocking spaces for volunteers.

But here's a quick recap of some of the main stories:  The UK economyhas ""clawed back"" about half the fall in output it saw during the peak of the coronavirus lockdownin March and April, according to the Bank of England's chief economist. Andy Haldane told MPs there had been a ""V"" shaped ""bounceback"". Last month, Mr Haldane said the economy was ""on track for a quick recovery"" - the so-called ""V"" shape. However, other economists have expressed doubts about the potential for such a swift recovery in activity. ""Roughly half of the roughly 25% fall in activity during March and April has been clawed back over the period since,"" Mr Haldane told members of the Treasury Select Committee. The economy had grown by about 1% per week, he said. ""We have seen a bounceback. So far, it has been a 'V'. That of course doesn't tell us about where we might go next,"" he added. As cases surge in a number of US states, more than a dozen National Football League (NFL) players have taken to social media to demand clarification of Covid-19 policies to keep players and their families safe. Stars including Seattle Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson and Houston Texans player JJ Watt used the Twitter hashtag #WeWantToPlay to question the NFL's safety plan as players are told to report for training camps across the country. Wilson tweeted on Sunday: ""My wife is pregnant. NFL training camp is about to start.. And there's still No Clear Plan on Player Health & Family Safety."" Infectious disease experts have put together response plans for the league's 32 teams, according to USA Today Sports. Protocols negotiated by the league and players' association include mask requirements, hand sanitising and minimising shared equipment. But players say they still have not been told how the league will handle a positive Covid-19 test among teammates, whether they can opt-out of high-risk situations, or if there will be access to daily testing, among other concerns. At least 72 NFL players have tested positive for the virus thus far, according to the players' association. So far, the NFL plans for teams to begin training camps for the next few weeks before the season begins in September. Teams will travel as they normally did, but there will be limits on the number of fans in the stadiums. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

In Texas - one of America's virus hotspots, with over 335,000 cases - the state attorney general has said that religious schools are exempt from local health restrictions. On Friday, Attorney General Ken Paxton wrote in an open letter that it would be unconstitutional to require religious schools to close under any government orders. He cited the First Amendment, which protects religious freedoms, as well as the Texas governor's, which prohibits local governments ""from closing religious institutions or dictating mitigation strategies to those institutions"". ""Religious private schools
may continue to determine when it is safe for their communities to resume in-person
instruction free from any government mandate or interference,"" Paxton said. ""Religious private
schools therefore need not comply with local public health orders to the contrary."" The guidance comes as schools across the US's second most populous state are trying to determine how to reopen amid a Covid-19 surge, with many educators saying they are afraid to resume in-person classes. Days after the attorney general's letter, and after five consecutive days of more than 10,000 new Covid-19 cases, Texas Governor Greg Abbott said US Navy medical teams have been deployed in the state to assist with battling the virus. This video can not be played Why Texas is seeing a surge in coronavirus cases Will GrantBBC News, Havana The Cuban health ministry has announced there has been no local transmission of coronavirus on the island for the first time in more than four months. There was just one case of Covid-19 registered in the past 24-hours - however, the government said the patient had travelled into Cuba from abroad. The Cuban government has been praised by the Pan American Health Organization for its robust response to the pandemic. Face masks are mandatory in most settings and the island is only very cautiously reopening under a gradual three-phased approach. Havana is currently in phase one with many economic and social activities suspended. Inter-province travel can begin again under phase two and children will only return to classes once phase three has been declared. People in Southwold say its summer visitors are returning As the UK went into lockdown, the seaside town of Southwold was pleading with visitors to stay away from its pier, golden sands and promenade lined with candy-coloured beach huts. Banners around town said that trips to the seaside or to second homes were not essential travel. ""Please respect us - don't infect us,"" they said. Nowthey're trying to encourage visitors back. At ice cream shop Beaches and Cream, Lynda Walker said the banners could not have been made by a business owner. ""We want to see holidaymakers - they're our bread and butter and we are glad they are back."" Some said the town already has ""that busy summer feeling"" but others like market stallholder Darren Crane worry that ""we haven't got many weeks left to make the money to get through the winter."" Meanwhile, officials in Wales say beauty spots are experiencing the opposite problem â they'reso overrun by visitors enjoying their restored freedom that the crowds of parked cars are ""putting lives at risk"". While outdoor dining has been allowed, indoor dining remains prohibited in New  York City New York City, once the epicentre of the pandemic in the US, is now entering the last phase of reopening - albeit with some modifications. It's the last region of the state to do so. Mayor Bill de Blasio said indoor dining and drinking would still not be allowed to resume and indoor venues like museums would remain closed. Other outdoor entertainment and sites, like professional sports, botanical gardens and zoos, can reopen with reduced capacity. Film and television production has also been given the go-ahead. It is unclear when indoor-only facilities will be allowed to reopen. The city and state are also still working on a plan to restart schools. Also on Monday, New York's Governor Andrew Cuomo will visit the southern state of Georgia, one of the states seeing a recent rise in Covid-19. Cuomo said he will meet with officials in Savannah, Georgia, to offer guidance and help with testing and tracing programmes as well as to deliver personal protective equipment. Cuomo said that health workers from across the country offered help to New York when his state was in the thick of it, and promised to repay the generosity.

Chris MasonPolitical Correspondent Coaches descend on Westminster Dozens of coaches have spent the afternoon making themselves heard in Westminster. They've been driving round in circles in Parliament Square blasting their horns - the industry says they have been forgotten by the government during the pandemic. I asked the Department for Transport for its reaction earlier this afternoon. A spokesman said the government has rovided a generous and wide-ranging package of support for businesses. ""Our job retention scheme has helped a million employers and protected more
than nine million jobs across the U.K. We have extended it until October â
meaning it will have been open for eight months and will continue to
support businesses as the economy reopens and people return to work,"" they said. They also highlighted other support measures like bounce back
loans, tax deferrals, business rates holidays and more than Â£10 billion of
grants. âLast week the Chancellor announced the second part of our support
for the economy through his Plan for Jobs, giving businesses the confidence to
retain and hire, and providing people with the tools they need to get better
jobs, including supporting jobs with a Â£1,000 Coronavirus Job Retention Bonus
for employers.â The coach industry wants help that is specifically tailored to them. Today's demonstration will no doubt not be the last - loads of industries are hurting and hurting badly, in a recession without precedent in modern times. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst An anti-mask protest that took place in Londonâs Hyde Park over the weekend is being widely mocked in China today, a country wheremandatory mask wearing because of Covid-19 has been part and parcel since the beginning of the year. Thousands have taken to Chinaâs Facebook-equivalent Sina Weibo, mocking resistance in England towards masks as a perceived restriction of freedom, even though wearing one will become mandatory in shops and supermarkets from 24 July. It comes at a time when relations between China and the UK are especially strained, withthe UK terminating its agreement with Chinese tech giant Huawei for 5G infrastructure last week, andthe UK government changing its extradition arrangements with Hong Kong. âLet them watch the âfreedomâ they value collapse,â one Weibo user says, and many speculate resistance could lead to a second wave in the country. Others joke the English are being brainwashed by conspiracy theories. âNo masks, no 5G, no vaccines = no lives,â one says. Some call the activists âapprentices of [US President] Trumpâ. You can read more about the different attitudes countries have to masks here. Outspoken Zimbabwean journalist Hopewell Chinâono has been arrested by police, human rights lawyer Beatrice Mtetwa has confirmed. He filmed his arrest before being told to put his phone down. Chinâono recently exposed an alleged Covid-19 procurement fraud within the health ministry. The story led to the arrest and sacking of Health Minister Obadiah Moyo President Emmerson Mnangagwa fired Mr Moyo earlier this month for âinappropriate conductâ over the $60m (Â£47.5m) medicines supply scandal. Mark SavageMusic reporter, BBC News Q Magazine, a cornerstone of rock journalism in the UK, is to close after 34 years. ""The pandemic did for us and there was nothing more to it than that,""said the editor Ted Kessler in a tweet.,externalHe also shared the editor's letter for the final issue, due on 28 July, in which he said: ""I must apologise for my failure to keep Q afloat."" The magazine's circulation had fallen to 28,000 per month from a peak of 200,000 in 2001. Founded in 1986 by Mark Ellen and David Hepworth, Q arrived at the same time as the CD revolution took off - and its glossy, aspirational format chimed perfectly with the times. Its hefty and comprehensive reviews section not only covered new releases, but the copious re-issues that were starting to appear as record labels plundered their archives to bolster the new format.

WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus The World Health Organization (WHO) has welcomed today's progress towards a vaccine but says work still needs to be done to combat the spread of Covid-19. At a briefing in Geneva, Dr Mike Ryan, director of the WHO emergencies programme, congratulated the scientists behindthe Oxford vaccine, saying: ""This is a positive result but again there is a long way to go."" He added that now, ""real world"" trials must be done on a larger scale. There are 23 potential vaccines in development thus far. ""But it is good to see more data and more products moving into this very important phase of vaccine discovery."" WHO chief Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus also emphasised that any successful vaccines must be accessible to all. He said many countries are seeing the advantages of making the vaccine ""a global public good"", but some are ""going the reverse direction"". ""When there is no consensus, it could be actually owned by those who have money and those who cannot afford it may not have access to the vaccines."" The director-general also said that while vaccine research continues, ""we have to save lives now"". ""We must continue to accelerate vaccine research while doing more with the tools we have at hand."" US President Donald Trump has said that, from tomorrow he will resume regular public briefings about his administration's response to America's coronavirus outbreak. Mr Trump gave 35 daily briefings with the White House's coronavirus task force in March and April, but frequently came under criticism for providing false or misleading statements. In turn, he accused the media of bias. He said the revival of briefings would allow him to share ""positive things"" his administration is doing, and updates on vaccines and treatments. ""I think itâs a great way to get information out to the public,"" the president told reporters. ""We had a lot of people watching, record numbers watching in the history of cable television, and thereâs never been anything like it."" His first briefing is scheduled for Tuesday at 17:00 local time (21:00 GMT). A further 11 deaths have been recorded in the UK, bringing the total number of people who died in hospital, care homes and the community after a positive coronavirus test to 45,312. According tocoronavirus.data.gov.uk,external, there were also 580 new positive tests in the last 24 hours, continuing a trend in recent days when the fall in cases appears to have levelled out. It comes after the Department of Health has ordered a review into the UK-wide daily death statistics, after concerns that figures contributed by England may include deaths which occur months after a positive test. Other UK nations have a 28-day cut-off point. But Public Health England is continuing to make the figures available on the coronavirus data dashboard. It says that about 4,000 of the 45,000 deaths occurred after more than 28 days, and only 2,000 of those were not attributed by the recording doctor to Covid-19. Miami Beach has enacted a curfew amid rising cases Florida has reported its fifth consecutive day of more than 10,000 new Covid-19 cases. On Sunday, an additional 12,478 people tested positive for coronavirus, according to the state health agency. The total number of cases since March in the Sunshine State is now more than 350,000. The death toll is nearing 5,000, and hospitals across the state say bed space is filling up. As officials try to contain the surge, some parts of South Florida have enacted curfews. On Saturday, Miami Beach set a curfew of 20:00 to 05:00. On Friday, Broward County ordered a curfew from 23:00 to 05:00, in place until 1 August. Congresswoman Donna Shalala, a Democrat representing part of Miami-Dade county,told ABC News,external: ""The residents here are terrified and Iâm terrified, for the first time in my career, because thereâs a lack of leadership."" About 23% of the total number of cases were reported in just the last week,the Tampa Bay Times reports,external. In an interview aired on Sunday, US President Donald Trump told Fox News: ""We have embers and we do have flames. Florida became more flame-like, but itâs - itâs going to be under control."" More on Florida: BBC OS Lydia Guthrie said she doesn't feel ""brave or selfless"" taking part in the trial One of those who volunteered to take part in the Oxford University vaccine trial is Lydia Guthrie. She was injected on April 30th with either the experimental Covid-19 vaccine or a placebo vaccine that protects against meningitis. Lydia says she developed flu-like symptoms after having her vaccine, but was warned by the research team that this might happen. Despite the small risk that was involved, she toldBBC OS on World Service radiothat she doesnât feel âbrave or selflessâ. âItâs not that brave because I trust the people involved. Itâs also not selfless because if we find a vaccine, I will benefit just as much as anybody else,"" said Lydia. âIf we get a vaccine Iâll be able to hug my mum again, and thatâs really worth it for me.â James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News These results from the Oxford vaccine trial are exciting, but
this is only the first hurdle. It is still not a vaccine we can say âworksâ. It is great news the vaccine can induce an immune response, including both antibodies that attack the virus and
T-cells, which hunt out and kill cells infected by the virus. But we do not know what level of
immune response is needed to protect people from coronavirus. That is why
further research is still needed. The answers at the moment are
unlikely to come from the UK as there is not enough coronavirus doing the
rounds to prove whether the vaccine is making a difference. The Oxford team already has
trials under way in South Africa and Brazil and there are plans for one in the
US too. However, it may yet require
âchallenge trialsâ in which people are vaccinated and deliberately infected
with the virus to see how effective it is. Read more here. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Positive,1.0
"Face masks are now mandatory in all enclosed public spaces, including shops France has made face masks compulsory in all enclosed public spaces amid a fresh bout of Covid-19 outbreaks. Masks were already mandatory on public transport, but from Monday they must also be worn in places like shops. Health Minister Oliver VÃ©ran warned that France had between ""400 and 500 active clusters"" of the virus. President Emmanuel Macron declared a ""first victory"" over the virus in June and has ended the national state of emergency, but local outbreaks remain. There are a rising number of cases in the north-west and in eastern regions, in particular in the north-western department of Mayenne. France, one of Europe's hardest-hit countries, has recorded more than 200,000 infections and over 30,000 deaths since the start of the pandemic. Face masks are now compulsory in all enclosed public spaces, including shops where previously owners were able to decide themselves whether customers should wear coverings or not. Anyone caught without a mask faces a fine of â¬135 (Â£123; $154). Authorities in Mayenne began calling for mandatory mask restrictions last week as cases soared in the department. Public health agency SantÃ© Publique France issued a warning for Mayenne after it passed the alert threshold of 50 new cases per 100,000 inhabitants in a week. Across France as a whole, that figure is about 10 per 100,000 inhabitants. France's health workers given 'historic' pay rises France honours health workers on Bastille Day Other regions are also worrying authorities. Brittany in the north-west of France has a reproduction number of 2.6 - meaning each infected person is passing on the virus to nearly three more. The eastern department of Vosges is also seeing rising cases, while the R number in Marseille and Nice is reportedly at 1.55. This video can not be played What is the R number and what does it mean? Mr VÃ©ran plans to travel to Mayenne later on Monday. While the country is ""very far"" from a second wave, he told broadcaster France Info that there were ""worrying signs of epidemic resumption"". ""We must remain vigilant,"" he said, noting that people had become weary of the restrictions and wanted to return to normal life. ""All options are on the table"" if local outbreaks worsen, he added, including regional lockdowns or even the return of national restrictions. France's ancient burial brotherhood defies Covid-19 The 98-year-old doctor working through lockdown Overall the outbreak is broadly under control across France. But a number of public health officials have warned of a potential second wave, and the government has begun stockpiling hundreds of millions of masks. Though countries had relaxed restrictions brought in to contain the spread of the virus, many across the continent have been forced to impose local lockdowns or even bring back national measures as infections have risen again. Spain's north-eastern region ofCatalonia has asked millions of its citizens to stay at home, with new cases threatening to overwhelm local health systems. Beach trip for Barcelona coronavirus patients Spain to cull almost 100,000 mink in Covid scare French Prime Minister Jean Castex said the country could close its border with Spain due to the rising number of local outbreaks. Cases are soaring in the Balkans Infections are also soaring throughout the Balkans. Bosnia-Herzegovina reported almost 300 new cases on Sunday, and a number of politicians have fallen ill with the virus - including former President Dragan Covic and the prime ministers of its two entities, the Federation and the Republika Srpska. Serbia, Albania and Montenegro are also reporting large rises in confirmed cases. Montenegro currently has about 195 cases per 100,000 residents - the highest number in the region.

Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst An anti-mask protest that took place in Londonâs Hyde Park over the weekend is being widely mocked in China today, a country wheremandatory mask wearing because of Covid-19 has been part and parcel since the beginning of the year. Thousands have taken to Chinaâs Facebook-equivalent Sina Weibo, mocking resistance in England towards masks as a perceived restriction of freedom, even though wearing one will become mandatory in shops and supermarkets from 24 July. It comes at a time when relations between China and the UK are especially strained, withthe UK terminating its agreement with Chinese tech giant Huawei for 5G infrastructure last week, andthe UK government changing its extradition arrangements with Hong Kong. âLet them watch the âfreedomâ they value collapse,â one Weibo user says, and many speculate resistance could lead to a second wave in the country. Others joke the English are being brainwashed by conspiracy theories. âNo masks, no 5G, no vaccines = no lives,â one says. Some call the activists âapprentices of [US President] Trumpâ.

Outspoken Zimbabwean journalist Hopewell Chinâono has been arrested by police, human rights lawyer Beatrice Mtetwa has confirmed. He filmed his arrest before being told to put his phone down. Chinâono recently exposed an alleged Covid-19 procurement fraud within the health ministry. The story led to the arrest and sacking of Health Minister Obadiah Moyo President Emmerson Mnangagwa fired Mr Moyo earlier this month for âinappropriate conductâ over the $60m (Â£47.5m) medicines supply scandal.

WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus The World Health Organization (WHO) has welcomed today's progress towards a vaccine but says work still needs to be done to combat the spread of Covid-19. At a briefing in Geneva, Dr Mike Ryan, director of the WHO emergencies programme, congratulated the scientists behindthe Oxford vaccine, saying: ""This is a positive result but again there is a long way to go."" He added that now, ""real world"" trials must be done on a larger scale. There are 23 potential vaccines in development thus far. ""But it is good to see more data and more products moving into this very important phase of vaccine discovery."" WHO chief Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus also emphasised that any successful vaccines must be accessible to all. He said many countries are seeing the advantages of making the vaccine ""a global public good"", but some are ""going the reverse direction"". ""When there is no consensus, it could be actually owned by those who have money and those who cannot afford it may not have access to the vaccines."" The director-general also said that while vaccine research continues, ""we have to save lives now"". ""We must continue to accelerate vaccine research while doing more with the tools we have at hand."" US President Donald Trump has said that, from tomorrow he will resume regular public briefings about his administration's response to America's coronavirus outbreak. Mr Trump gave 35 daily briefings with the White House's coronavirus task force in March and April, but frequently came under criticism for providing false or misleading statements. In turn, he accused the media of bias. He said the revival of briefings would allow him to share ""positive things"" his administration is doing, and updates on vaccines and treatments. ""I think itâs a great way to get information out to the public,"" the president told reporters. ""We had a lot of people watching, record numbers watching in the history of cable television, and thereâs never been anything like it."" His first briefing is scheduled for Tuesday at 17:00 local time (21:00 GMT). A further 11 deaths have been recorded in the UK, bringing the total number of people who died in hospital, care homes and the community after a positive coronavirus test to 45,312. According tocoronavirus.data.gov.uk,external, there were also 580 new positive tests in the last 24 hours, continuing a trend in recent days when the fall in cases appears to have levelled out. It comes after the Department of Health has ordered a review into the UK-wide daily death statistics, after concerns that figures contributed by England may include deaths which occur months after a positive test. Other UK nations have a 28-day cut-off point. But Public Health England is continuing to make the figures available on the coronavirus data dashboard. It says that about 4,000 of the 45,000 deaths occurred after more than 28 days, and only 2,000 of those were not attributed by the recording doctor to Covid-19. Miami Beach has enacted a curfew amid rising cases Florida has reported its fifth consecutive day of more than 10,000 new Covid-19 cases. On Sunday, an additional 12,478 people tested positive for coronavirus, according to the state health agency. The total number of cases since March in the Sunshine State is now more than 350,000. The death toll is nearing 5,000, and hospitals across the state say bed space is filling up. As officials try to contain the surge, some parts of South Florida have enacted curfews. On Saturday, Miami Beach set a curfew of 20:00 to 05:00. On Friday, Broward County ordered a curfew from 23:00 to 05:00, in place until 1 August. Congresswoman Donna Shalala, a Democrat representing part of Miami-Dade county,told ABC News,external: ""The residents here are terrified and Iâm terrified, for the first time in my career, because thereâs a lack of leadership."" About 23% of the total number of cases were reported in just the last week,the Tampa Bay Times reports,external. In an interview aired on Sunday, US President Donald Trump told Fox News: ""We have embers and we do have flames. Florida became more flame-like, but itâs - itâs going to be under control."" More on Florida: BBC OS Lydia Guthrie said she doesn't feel ""brave or selfless"" taking part in the trial One of those who volunteered to take part in the Oxford University vaccine trial is Lydia Guthrie. She was injected on April 30th with either the experimental Covid-19 vaccine or a placebo vaccine that protects against meningitis. Lydia says she developed flu-like symptoms after having her vaccine, but was warned by the research team that this might happen. Despite the small risk that was involved, she toldBBC OS on World Service radiothat she doesnât feel âbrave or selflessâ. âItâs not that brave because I trust the people involved. Itâs also not selfless because if we find a vaccine, I will benefit just as much as anybody else,"" said Lydia. âIf we get a vaccine Iâll be able to hug my mum again, and thatâs really worth it for me.â James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News These results from the Oxford vaccine trial are exciting, but
this is only the first hurdle. It is still not a vaccine we can say âworksâ. It is great news the vaccine can induce an immune response, including both antibodies that attack the virus and
T-cells, which hunt out and kill cells infected by the virus. But we do not know what level of
immune response is needed to protect people from coronavirus. That is why
further research is still needed. The answers at the moment are
unlikely to come from the UK as there is not enough coronavirus doing the
rounds to prove whether the vaccine is making a difference. The Oxford team already has
trials under way in South Africa and Brazil and there are plans for one in the
US too. However, it may yet require
âchallenge trialsâ in which people are vaccinated and deliberately infected
with the virus to see how effective it is. Read more here. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Negative,1.2624006e-05
"Q Magazine attracted some of the biggest names in rock and pop Q Magazine, a cornerstone of rock journalism in the UK, is to close after 34 years. ""The pandemic did for us and there was nothing more to it than that,""said the editor Ted Kessler in a tweet.,external He also shared the editor's letter for the final issue, due on 28 July, in which he said: ""I must apologise for my failure to keep Q afloat."" The magazine's circulation had fallen to 28,000 per month from a peak of 200,000 in 2001. Founded in 1986 by Smash Hits writers Mark Ellen and David Hepworth, Q arrived at the same time as the CD revolution took off - and its glossy, aspirational format chimed perfectly with the times. Its hefty and comprehensive reviews section not only covered new releases, but the copious re-issues that were starting to appear as record labels plundered their archives to bolster the new format. Yet the magazine was characterised as much by its irreverence as its knowledge. Pop stars lived in fear of ending up in Tom Hibbert's ""Who The Hell Do They Think They Are?"" column, which was launched in the late 1980s to ""lampoon ego-mania and harpoon narcissism"" and ran for several years until PR gurus got wise. Hibbert had a knack of needling his interviewees until they dispensed with niceties and revealed their true selves: ""Don't nit-pick me, boy,"" Jerry Lee Lewis once berated him, after a volley of questions about his rivalry with Elvis Presley. ""You mention Elvis to me again, you keep digging me about that and I'm gonna kill you, so help me God!"" How coronavirus infected publishing Ringo Starr, meanwhile, was forced to compare his 1992 solo album Time Takes Time with some of his earlier, better, work. ""My album can't beat the Abbey Road album as an album?"" he asked incredulously. ""That was 30 years ago, man. I'm still making records and you can hear that I'm a great musician on the new record. ""This is an actual bloody legend in front of you. I'm not expecting you to comb the bloody legend's hair but if you could mention the new LP and these other fine musicians I'm still playing with."" But on the whole, Q tended to be on better terms with its subjects. The annual Q Awards were a famously boozy affair, where rock royalty rubbed shoulders The first cover star was Paul McCartney, closely followed by Rod Stewart and Elton John (Headline: ""The wit, the wisdom, the wardrobe""). Future editions saw the likes of Madonna, Prince, Kate Bush, Nirvana, a pregnant Britney Spears and a naked Terence Trent D'Arby grace the cover. Former editor Danny Kelly later said he'd worked out that D'Arby was ""the only star beautiful enough and egotistical enough to get their kit off"". It flourished during the Britpop years, but saw its reputation stall in the mid-2010s with a listicle format  (""the 10 greatest gigs of all time"" or ""the 120 greatest stories in rock 'n' roll"") that minimised the strength of its journalism. More recently, the magazine had rediscovered its voice under Kessler, who was appointed editor in 2017, and promoted revealing, in-depth interviews with the likes of Lana Del Rey, Tame Impala and The Streets; alongside deep dives into the back catalogues of The Specials and the Beastie Boys. However, in May, Q's owner Bauer Media put the title under review, along with a number of others in its portfolio, as sales and advertising revenues diminished during the coronavirus pandemic. The penultimate issue of the magazine read like a eulogy, with writers past and present recalling their most memorable interviews of the last 34 years. Writer Adrian Deevoy recalled a 1991 encounter with Madonna, where she declared: ""Everyone probably thinks I'm a raving nymphomaniac, when the truth is I'd rather read a book."" And Dorian Lynskey recounted a trip to Argentina with Noel Gallagher, where the erstwhile Oasis guitarist demanded a DJ played Madonna's Hung Up, and slow-danced with Bono to David Bowie's Let's Dance. David Bowie and Iman were guests at the 1995 Q Awards Bono appeared on the magazine's last page, too, reflecting on its fate. ""I'm gonna miss it if it goes, because it had everything I want from a music mag,"" he said. ""All the serious and all the silly... The scholarship deftly done"". The magazine will eke out one final issue after those words. Kessler shared an image of the cover on Twitter, suggesting it will be another trawl through the archives, under the headline: ""Adventures with Legends, 1986 - 2020"". In his editor's letter, he wrote: """"We've been a lean operation for all of my tenure, employing a variety of ways to help keep our head above water in an extremely challenging print market. ""Hopefully these final issues will provide inspiration to someone canny enough to fill that huge, Q-shaped hole on the news stand."" Tim Burgess, frontman of the Charlatans, was among those paying tribute, saying: ""Sad news â¦ Q was good to us over the years, I learned much from its pages, ever since I bought the very first copy."" Rock band Field Music called the closure ""extremely crappy news,"" pointing out that Q was ""a small but significant piece of the jigsaw which holds the music industry together"". Sleaford Mods added that ""an article in Q"" was something ""musicians dream about achieving"" and sent best wishes to Kessler and the rest of the staff.

"Kaye Flitney is one of those enrolled on the clinical trial The preliminary results of a clinical trial suggest a new treatment for Covid-19 reduces the number of patients needing intensive care, according to the UK company that developed it. The treatment from Southampton-based biotech Synairgen uses a protein called interferon beta which the body produces when it gets a viral infection. The protein is inhaled directly into the lungs of patients with coronavirus, using a nebuliser, in the hope that it will stimulate an immune response. The initial findings suggest the treatment cut the odds of a Covid-19 patient in hospital developing severe disease - such as requiring ventilation - by 79%. Patients were two to three times more likely to recover to the point where everyday activities were not compromised by their illness, Synairgen claims. It said the trial also indicated ""very significant"" reductions in breathlessness among patients who received the treatment. In addition, the average time patients spent in hospital is said to have been reduced by a third, for those receiving the new drug - down from an average of nine days to six days. UK hospital trials new coronavirus treatment drug Life-saving coronavirus drug 'major breakthrough' Coronavirus anti-viral drug 'biggest step forward' How near are we to curing coronavirus? The double-blind trial involved 101 volunteers who had been admitted for treatment at nine UK hospitals for Covid-19 infections. Half of the participants were given the drug, the other half got what is known as a placebo - an inactive substance. Stock market rules mean Synairgen is obliged to report the preliminary results of the trial. The results have not been published in a peer-reviewed journal, nor has the full data been made available; so the BBC cannot confirm the claims made for the treatment. This video can not be played Professor Tom Wilkinson: ""These are all encouraging signals... that the drug is having an important clinical effect"" But if the results are as the company says, it will be a very important step forward in the treatment of coronavirus infections. The scientist in charge of the trial, Tom Wilkinson, says if the results are confirmed in larger studies the new treatment will be ""a game changer"". The trial was relatively small but the signal that the treatment benefits patients was unusually strong, he says. ""We couldn't have expected much better results than these,"" Synairgen chief executive Richard Marsden told the BBC. He described the results as ""a major breakthrough in the treatment of hospitalised Covid-19 patients"". The BBC's Justin Rowlatt with nurse Sandy Aitken at a patient's bedside Mr Marsden said the company will be presenting its findings to medical regulators around the world in the next couple of days to see what further information they require in order to approve the treatment. That process could take months, although the British government, like many others, has said it will work as fast as possible to get promising coronavirus treatments approved. It is possible it could be given emergency approval,as the anti-viral drug remdesivir was in May. Another possibility is that permission will be given for more patients to receive the treatment with the effects being carefully monitored to confirm it is safe and effective. If it does get approval, the drug and the nebulisers used to deliver it would then need to be manufactured in large quantities. Mr Marsden says he instructed companies to start producing supplies back in April to ensure they would be available should the results be positive. He says he expects Synairgen to be able to deliver ""a few 100,000"" doses a month by the winter. Interferon beta is part of the body's first line of defence against viruses, warning it to expect a viral attack. The coronavirus seems to suppress its production as part of its strategy to evade our immune systems. This video can not be played Synairgen CEO Richard Marsden explains how the treatment uses the protein interferon beta to help fight the virus The new drug is a special formulation of interferon beta delivered directly to the airways via a nebuliser which makes the protein into an aerosol. The idea is that a direct dose of the protein in the lungs will trigger a stronger anti-viral response, even in patients whose immune systems are already weak. Interferon beta is commonly used in the treatment of multiple sclerosis. Previous clinical trials conducted by Synairgen have shown that it can stimulate an immune response and that patients with asthma and other chronic lung conditions can comfortably tolerate the treatment. No-one involved in the trial knew which patients have been given which treatment until it was over. ""If you know it's a drug, your mind might have a bias,"" explained Sandy Aitken, one of the nurses who administered the new drug to patients at Southampton Hospital. Synairgen's drug trial was the template for the Accord programme, a fast-track clinical trial scheme set up by the UK government in April to accelerate the development of new drugs for patients with Covid-19. The Synairgen team believes the drug could be even more effective at the early stages of infection. A trial exploring the effects of giving patients who are in high-risk groups the new drug as soon as they are confirmed as having Covid-19 has struggled to find volunteers because there are so few new infections at the moment. Expert in emergency medicine Prof Steve Goodacre, from the University of Sheffield, said: ""These results are not interpretable. We need the full details and, perhaps more importantly, the trial protocol. The trial should have been registered and a protocol made available before any analysis was undertaken."" Prof Naveed Sattar, professor of metabolic medicine at the University of Glasgow, said: ""The results seem very impressive, and although accepted that the trial is small with just over 100 participants, a 79% reduction in disease severity could be a game changer. ""It would be good to see the full results once presented and peer-reviewed to make sure they are robust and the trial conduct was rigorous. Also, with small numbers comes less certainty on the true level of benefit, or whether benefits vary between people with differing risk characteristics. Such work would require a larger trial but, even so, these results are very exciting."" SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now?

"Nigel Manton from Cheshire says he spent Â£10,000 on business interruption insurance for nothing ""It's a bit galling to realise... we've spent more than Â£10,000 on insurance which wasn't valid,"" says Nigel Manton, of the Fresh Skin Clinic, in Cheshire. His firm is one of hundreds that say they were wrongly denied cover for the virus and could go bust as a result. A court case to decide whether many businesses receive insurance payouts for damage caused to them by the pandemic begins on Monday. However, insurers say most business policies simply do not cover pandemics. A judge will decide on the correct interpretation of 17 so-called business interruption policies, but the ruling could affect up to 370,000 firms. ""All businesses thought they'd inoculated themselves by buying this insurance and they have found that this financial vaccine doesn't work,"" says Mr Manton. Following the lockdown, a host of businesses had to close their doors and many looked to insurers to cover their losses through their business interruption policies. Insurance firms ordered to pay out or explain However, many insurers disputed these claims, arguing that such policies were never intended for losses caused by unprecedented measures such as government-imposed lockdowns. About 400 companies have complained to the financial ombudsman, prompting City regulator the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) to bring this case. It has selected 17 examples from business interruption insurance policies used by 16 insurers, eight of whom were asked to take part in the court case. These include Hiscox, RSA Group, Arch Insurance, Argenta, Ecclesiastical, MS Amlin, QBE and Zurich, all of whom agreed to take part voluntarily. The FCA says the case will provide ""clarity and certainty for everyone involved in these business interruption disputes, policyholder and insurer alike"". The views of Mr Manton are echoed by the many businesses who've contacted the BBC over the past few months to express frustration that their business interruption insurance wouldn't pay out. After all, their business was indeed interrupted by the coronavirus pandemic, as the lockdown stopped them from using their premises, for example. Now many are crossing their fingers that the results of this case will mean their policies could pay out in future as many are - in the words of the FCA - ""under intense financial strain"". Simon Ager fears he could incur Â£200,000 of losses due to lockdown Simon Ager told the BBC his climbing company was at risk of being bankrupted because his insurer Hiscox was refusing to cover losses. According to his policy, the insurer should cover financial losses for any business unable to use their premises following ""an occurrence of any human infectious or human contagious disease, an outbreak of which must be notified to the local authority"". However, citing a separate clause, Hiscox argues that the policy was intended to cover incidents that occur only within a mile of a business Mr Ager is now part of the Hiscox Action Group, 369 of whose members are owed Â£47m in uncovered losses. They will give evidence in this week's case and have begun a separate arbitration claim against the insurer. Richard Leedham, a senior partner at law firm Mishcon de Reya, which represents the group, said: ""We can shed additional light on the matter and explain exactly why these policies should pay out and show the damage this refusal is doing to hundreds if not thousands of British businesses."" The Association of British Insurers says most business policies do not cover pandemics, as the level of risk involved would make premiums unaffordable. Instead the majority focus on property damage. Huw Evans, director general of the ABI, told the BBC: ""This is not a debate about whether these policies were intended to cover pandemics, it is a debate as to whether the wordings of these policies inadvertently cover pandemics. ""It is an argument about whether the wording allows insurers to decline the claim."" In June, Hiscox said it recognised businesses faced ""extremely difficult times"" and was committed to ""seeking expedited resolution of any contract dispute"". RSA Group said it continued to ""treat claims in line with legal advice, precedent and case law"". The FCA has said the 17 policies under review in the case are only a ""representative sample"" and that the test case would provide guidance for the interpretation of""many other"" business interruption policies.,external However, it has also said all along that most small business insurance policies will only focus on property damage and only have basic cover for business interruption. As such, it believes ""in the majority of cases, insurers are not obliged to pay out in relation to the coronavirus pandemic"" and this court case will only focus on the ""remainder of policies that could be argued to include cover"". The trial is expected to take eight days. âMy business could go bust if insurers donât payâ Insurance firms ordered to pay out or explain 'Like an atomic bomb': Los Angeles fire chiefs warn death toll is likely to rise What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

"UK High Street stalwart Marks and Spencer is to cut hundreds of jobs as coronavirus continues to hit trading. The retailer said 950 store management and head office jobs were at risk because it needed to accelerate its restructuring. A spokesperson said the move marked ""an important step"" in it becoming a ""stronger, leaner"" business. M&S was already undergoing a transformation that included cutting costs and closing some stores. The firm said that because of the pandemic, those measures would be accelerated under a programme called Never The Same Again. M&S said it now wanted to ""make three years' progress in one"". Retail sales jump in June - 'but crisis not over' John Lewis and Boots to cut 5,300 jobs M&S said it had started collective consultation with employee representatives and had set out plans to offer voluntary redundancy first to affected staff. Sacha Berendji, director of retail, operations and property at M&S, said: ""Through the crisis, we have seen how we can work faster and more flexibly by empowering store teams and it's essential that we embed that way of working. ""Our priority now is to support all those affected through the consultation process and beyond."" M&S's food stores were open throughout the coronavirus lockdown, but trading in other parts of the business was severely affected. Clothing sales fell by 84% year-on-year at the lowest point, the firm said in May,warning that some customer habits had ""changed forever"". M&S was already struggling to adapt to the rise of online shopping and changing customer tastes. The company had been facing increasing competition from fashion giants such as Primark on the High Street and Asos on the internet. It is also one of the few big food retailers without its own internet-based delivery service. However, the retailer's partnership with Ocado starts in September, replacing the online grocer's existing deal with Waitrose. In May, M&S chief executive Steve Rowe said that the impact of the virus lockdown had driven ""effects and aftershocks"" in the retail sector that would ""endure for the coming year and beyond"". Its latest announcement comes after a wave of redundancies on the High Street, with John Lewis, Boots and Debenhams among retailers announcing huge job cuts. Other lay-offs announced during the pandemic have included: Up to 5,000 job cutsat Upper Crust owner SSP Group Up to 700 jobs at Harrods About 600 workersat shirtmaker TM Lewin 1,900 jobs at CafÃ© Rouge-owner Casual Dining Group 1,000 jobsat Pret A Manger 1,700 UK jobsat plane-maker Airbus 1,300 crew and 727 pilotsat EasyJet 550 jobsare going at Daily Mirror publisher Reach On Monday, Ted Baker confirmed it could cut about a quarter of its UK workforce after the coronavirus pandemic added to its financial difficulties. The fashion retailer did not confirm the number of redundancies, but there are reports that 500 store and head office jobs will go. ""We have not taken this decision lightly and would like to thank all our colleagues for their hard work,"" a spokesperson said. The move is intended to save about Â£6m by the end of the year. Both part-time and full-time roles will be affected. About 200 jobs will go at the Ugly Brown Building, its London headquarters, with the rest from its 46 shops across the UK and Europe, as well as many store concessions.

"Martin Lewis says the new website promotes poor financial decisions by graduates Changes to the Student Loans Company's website are ""irresponsible and dangerous"", the consumer finance expert Martin Lewis has claimed. Mr Lewis says a new ""quick repayment"" tool gives UK graduates a ""damaging, demoralising"" picture of their debts. He says the tool exaggerates the status of their outstanding loans. The SLC says its online repayment service gives the most up to date student loan account information that has ever been made available. The company's website has been moved from the site SLC.co.uk to theGov.uk site,external. But Mr Lewis, founder of the website Moneysavingexpert.com, says that ""far from taking on board widespread concerns that student loans information is misleading and promotes financially poor decisions by graduates, the SLC has in some places doubled down on the opposite"". ""The first thing university leavers see when they log in, in a large font, is the amount of 'debt' they owe. ""This is demoralising, damaging and dangerous,"" he said. More students say university not value for money Should I go to university this year? ""Owing Â£30,000, Â£300,000 or Â£3m makes no difference to your annual repayments, which are set at 9% of everything you earn over a threshold (currently Â£26,575 per year for Plan 2 loans and Â£19,390 for Plan 1). ""The only impact the amount of debt has is whether you clear it or not within the 30 years before it wipes; and it's predicted the vast majority, 83%, of university leavers won't be earning enough that their repayments clear it in full. ""They'll keep repaying it for the whole 30 years, like an additional tax - so the debt amount for them is pretty irrelevant."" The SLC says the online repayment service  is designed ""to make it easier for graduates to access their account, manage their student loan and to avoid over repayment"". The company added: ""The service was extensively researched and tested prior to launch and the overriding feedback from our customers was that they wanted to be able to quickly and easily access their loan balance online. ""The balance information is particularly important to customers in the final stages of repayment as it helps them to determine when they should switch their repayments to direct debit."" The SLC said the site made it clear that customers should carefully consider their circumstances before making any additional voluntary repayments and that any outstanding balance is written off at the end of the loan. ""In the coming months we will be contacting customers to remind them that, irrespective of the outstanding loan balance, they can only be required to pay 9% of earnings above the repayment threshold, and that they should consider their circumstances carefully before making any voluntary repayments."" But Mr Lewis says the new site majors on a ""scary, but often irrelevant, number"" of the debt owed. ""That makes many think they should overpay like a normal debt. ""Yet, unless you're making huge overpayments, for most people overpaying does diddly squat - you'll still continue to repay 9% of everything over the threshold for 30 years,"" he said. ""Overpaying is a total waste of money. ""So I was flabbergasted to see they went live with a 'quick repayment' system, without detailed warnings, cautions and explanation. ""That's irresponsible and dangerous beyond belief.  It's doubling down on the damage."" Mr Lewis says he will be writing to the SLC and the universities minister, Michelle Donelan, calling for the quick repayment facility to be removed immediately and for a thorough overhaul of the new government website.

"Face coverings are becoming compulsory on all public transport across the UK Factories in south Wales and Lancashire have started making ""high quality"" face coverings as part of a push to produce a million a week. Some Â£14m is being invested by the UK government, with productions underway in Port Talbot and Blackburn. Face coverings are already compulsory in shops across Scotland, and will be in England from 24 July. Masks are also compulsory on all public transport across the UK, including Wales from 27 July. ""This is a major step to ensure that this country can meet any increase in demand for face coverings by working with British firms to establish the capability, capacity and skills required to manufacture these items at scale,"" said Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove. ""These production lines will be able to get millions of face coverings to the public, without putting any additional pressure on NHS supply chains."" What are the latest rules on face masks? How to make your own face mask The Cabinet Office said 10 production lines had been bought, including 34 tons of equipment and machinery, while a further 10 had been commissioned from Coventry-based automotive company Expert Tooling and Automation Ltd. The mask will be disposable, single-use coverings. Welsh Secretary Simon Hart said the investment at British Rototherm was welcomed Engineering firm British Rototherm Group at Margam, in Neath Port Talbot, has expanded its workforce to meet the new mask orders. Cookson & Clegg in Blackburn has also begun manufacturing. A third site at Transcal at Livingston in Scotland will be online in the coming weeks. Visiting the south Wales site on Monday, Welsh Secretary Simon Hart said the investment was good news for the company and for the UK. ""There aren't many good news stories coming out of Covid - this happens to be one of them,"" he told BBC Wales. ""This is about members of the public being properly equipped, not just now but also for any future similar occurrences, if that was ever to happen."" UK officials said the new production sites would ensure public demand for face coverings did not impact on the supply of higher-grade face masks for front-line NHS staff.

"Police officers detain protesters in Hong Kong during a rally against the new national security law Boris Johnson says the UK's extradition arrangements with Hong Kong will be changed, amid rising tensions with China. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab is expected to suspend an extradition deal with the territory later. It comes after Beijing imposed a controversialnational security lawon the ex-British colony, introducing new crimes with severe penalties. China has accused the UK of ""brutal meddling"" in its affairs. The UK has alreadyoffered residency rightsand a path to UK citizenship to around three million Hong Kongers in response to the law's imposition. Beijing has insisted it is committed to upholding international law, and has promised a ""resolute response"" if the UK withdraws from extradition arrangements. Why are the UK and China arguing about Hong Kong? UK makes citizenship offer to Hong Kong residents China's new law: Why is Hong Kong worried? The extradition treaty means that, if someone in Hong Kong is suspected of a crime in the UK, then the British authorities can ask Hong Kong to hand them over to face justice - and vice versa. The UK fears the arrangement - which has been in place for more than 30 years - could see anyone it extradites to Hong Kong being sent on to China. Hong Kong has extradition agreements with 19 other countries apart from the UK, including Canada andAustralia, which have already suspendedtheirs following the imposition there of China's new security law - which makes acts of subversion punishable by life sentences. Mr Johnson said the UK had ""concerns"" over the new law, and it had to think about the rights of people in Hong Kong to participate in democratic processes. But he added: ""There is a balance here. I'm not going to be pushed into a position of becoming a knee-jerk Sinophobe on every issue, somebody who is automatically anti-China"". ""We've got to have a calibrated approach. We're going to be tough on some things, but we're going to continue to engage."" The UK handed Hong Kong back to China in 1997 but, as part of an agreement signed at the time, it enjoys some freedoms not seen in the mainland. But political and economic relations between the UK and China have become strained in recent months. Earlier this month, the UK decided toban Chinese tech firm Huaweifrom its 5G network, citing security concerns denied by the company. The UK, US and EU have accused Beijing of undermining the ""One Country, Two Systems"" principle, which has guaranteed a high degree of autonomy for Hong Kong since it was handed back to Chinese rule in 1997. They say the security laws which came into force last month breach the terms of the1984 Joint Declaration,externalprotecting political and economic freedoms - which agreed the conditions under which Hong Kong would be run when Britain gave it back to China in 1997. Hong Kong timeline How is Hong Kong run? What is Huawei and why is it being banned? This video can not be played Tea, drugs and war: Hong Kong's British history explained The UK denounced the new lawsas ""deeply troubling"", with the foreign secretary calling the move ""a grave step"". In response, the UK has offered the 350,000 Hong Kong residents who hold British Overseas National passports - and a further 2.6 million who are eligible for them - enhanced residency rights should they wish to come to the UK and a route to possible citizenship. But China has warned it will retaliate if the UK imposes sanctions on any of its leading officials in relation to human rights offences and allegations of police brutality in Hong Kong. Proposals for an extradition treaty between Hong Kong and mainland China provoked widespread protests last year amid concerns about political interference in the Chinese judicial system and the right to a fair trial. Analysis by James Robbins, BBC Diplomatic Correspondent Suspending extradition to Hong Kong is a very obvious step to take. Even if the treaty remained fully in place, it would be hard to imagine the circumstances in which the UK would now agree to hand over any suspect to the Hong Kong authorities for trial - knowing they might end up in a Chinese mainland court, and then a prison far from Hong Kong. British suspension of the treaty - rather than outright abandonment - is quite normal. Diplomatically, it allows China a way back, however unlikely it is there will be any retreat by Beijing. The UK does not want to be the side to initiate a trade war with China, hence the focus on justice and the rule of law. China has already warned - in the context of Huawei as well as Hong Kong - that Chinese businesses may judge Britain an unsuitable or unreliable partner in future. The UK won't be the one turning up the heat in that area. But further British measures against China can't be ruled out. This video can not be played China's ambassador Liu Xiaoming: ""There is no such concentration camp in Xinjiang"" The UK has also stepped up its criticism of China's human rights record, accusing Beijing of ""gross and egregious"" abuses against the Uighur population in Xinjiang province. Mr Raab told the BBC that reports of forced sterilisation and wider persecution of the Muslim group were ""reminiscent of something not seen for a long time"". Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said his party would support a change to extradition arrangements with Hong Kong, calling it a ""step in the right direction"". But he called on the government to ""go further"" by considering immediate sanctions on Chinese officials involved in rights abuses against Uighur Muslims. UK accuses China of 'gross' abuses against Uighurs Who are the Uighurs? UK imposes sanctions against human rights abusers Drone footage that has been widely circulated - and authenticated by Australian security services - appears to show Uighurs being blindfolded and led to trains. However, China's UK ambassador, Liu Xiaoming,dismissed talks of concentration camps as ""fake"".

"The world eagerly awaits a coronavirus vaccine, and labs are racing to develop one. Some have now reached the stage of human trials and are looking for volunteers. So what's it like to be part of a vaccine trial? I remember very clearly my first medical trial. It was in Oxford where I was going to receive an experimental vaccine against bird flu. This was in 2006 and at the time H5N1 avian flu was a big deal. It was a deadly virus, killing half of those it infected. That would make it perhaps 50 times more lethal than Covid-19. So there was a need for a vaccine, and the Oxford Vaccine Group was to conduct a trial of healthy volunteers. I didn't hesitate about sticking my hand up, or rather, rolling up my sleeve. After all, I rely on patients to agree to me filming them in order to illustrate some aspect of healthcare, so it was a good thing for me to experience what that's like. Very often they are taking part in a medical trial, be it for cancer, diabetes or any number of other conditions. Naturally I was filmed while receiving the vaccine. I can remember being determined not to grimace because I didn't want to set a bad example. The immunisation takes just a few seconds, and I also had to give some blood samples the same day. As the needle for the blood draw was about to go in, a kindly doctor said ""sharp scratch"" which was my cue to look into the lens and deliver a faultless ""piece to camera"" - the bit in most TV reports when correspondents pontificate. But with a needle in your arm you have to get it right the first time. As my blood entered the test tube I spoke about antibodies and immunity. I think it went fine, but I remember a recent occasion that was a nightmare. Again, I started speaking as the needle went in, and my words, thankfully, flowed out on cue. The trouble was, the red stuff did not. It was like getting blood from a stone. It took four needles, and by the end of the filming the colour had drained from my face and I was in a cold sweat. As the BBC's medical correspondent, since 2004 I have reported on global disease threats such as bird flu, swine flu, Sars and Mers - both coronaviruses - and Ebola. You could say I've been waiting much of my career for a global pandemic. And yet when Covid-19 came along, the world was not as ready as it could have been. Now it's here I wish, like everyone else, it would go away. Sadly, we may have to live with coronavirus indefinitely. In this column I will be reflecting on that new reality. The bird flu vaccine trial went well. The following year it was approved for use, but bird flu never made the full jump from animals to humans, so it's not been needed. Not so with coronavirus. To say the results of vaccine studies are eagerly awaited would be the understatement of the year. There are lives, livelihoods and whole economies depending on a successful vaccine against Sars-CoV-2, to give the virus its proper name. More than 100 vaccines are in development around the world. Many of these may never get to human trials, but several have already reached that stage, in record time.Normally it would take years, decades even. The Chinese government shared the genetic sequence of coronavirus on 11 January, and within weeks a team at the University of Oxford had developed an experimental vaccine.  Their human trial,the first in Europe, began last month. More than 1,000 volunteers are now part of the Oxford vaccine study. Half will get ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, as the vaccine is called, and the rest a control vaccine which protects against meningitis. The trial is ""blinded"" so that the researchers and the volunteers won't know which jab they are getting. The use of a real vaccine as a control, which may result in the odd sore arm, means volunteers really won't know whether they have got the real thing. That's important, as all of them will need to keep a daily health diary for up to four weeks, and come back for several blood tests. Samples of the vaccine have been made for the trial I wanted to volunteer for the first phase of the vaccine trial, but was ineligible. It's the first time I've been too old for a clinical study - the cut-off was 55 years and I'll be 59 in September. Though the trial has now been extended to include older adults and children aged five to 12, I may still be ruled out. Anyone who already has antibodies to coronavirus is excluded, andas I explained last week, I'm pretty sure I have these. I have signed up online just in case they will have me. This video can not be played Elisa Granato was the first volunteer to be injected In order to check whether the vaccine works, it is vital that those given the jab come across the virus in their daily lives. So the team would like volunteers who have public-facing roles, especially health workers, who are more likely to be exposed to coronavirus. You don't need all of your volunteers to get up close and personal with the virus, but it's important that some do, and in the absence of a guaranteed treatment it would be unethical to deliberately infect them. The volunteers are all told to maintain the same social distancing as the rest of us. And remember they don't know which vaccine they have received. Fergus holding a vial of the vaccine developed by the Oxford team There's one big problem surrounding all of this, which is that you need a lot of virus to be circulating to know whether the vaccine protects the people who've been immunised, and at present cases are decreasing. It's reckoned about one in 1,000 people in England are currently infected, not counting cases in hospitals or care homes. A further10,000 volunteers are being recruited,externalat sites across England, Wales and Scotland. At present there are more cases in parts of the north of England and Scotland than in Oxford. This video can not be played Coronavirus vaccine: How close are you to getting one? Volunteers are absolutely crucial to medical advances; we'd never get anywhere without them. The same goes for blood donors. With all the volunteers I've spoken to over the years there's a really strong element of giving something back. People say, ""Well, it may not help me, but it'll help those coming after me."" Some years ago, I covered a typhoid study in Oxford, in which they were immunising people with a new vaccine, and then infecting them deliberately with the disease - they could do this because it can be treated with antibiotics. The volunteers had to swallow a drink that had typhoid bacteria in it, and I remember one of them saying, ""Down the hatch!"" before they drank it. That vaccine isnow being usedin Pakistan and Zimbabwe, and has reduced cases of the disease by 80%.  When I let those volunteers know recently, they were delighted. That trial was of absolutely no benefit to their daily lives, they did it purely because they felt it was the right thing to do. But with the coronavirus trial there may be some benefits for volunteers. LOCKDOWN UPDATE:What's changing, where? EXERCISE:What are the guidelines on getting out?

There has been much speculation about when we will get results from the Oxford vaccine trial.  I've heard September, even June. The hard truth is, it's not certain when we will know. It depends on whether we get a second wave of infections. If, and it's still a big if, the vaccine does work, hundreds of millions of doses could be made within months because of a manufacturing deal struck with the pharma giant, AstraZeneca. It says it could produce a billion doses by the end of 2021. And the Oxford vaccine is not the only show in town. Imperial College London is developing a coronavirus vaccine which will begin human trials next month.

"Kaye Flitney is one of those enrolled on the clinical trial The preliminary results of a clinical trial suggest a new treatment for Covid-19 reduces the number of patients needing intensive care, according to the UK company that developed it. The treatment from Southampton-based biotech Synairgen uses a protein called interferon beta which the body produces when it gets a viral infection. The protein is inhaled directly into the lungs of patients with coronavirus, using a nebuliser, in the hope that it will stimulate an immune response. The initial findings suggest the treatment cut the odds of a Covid-19 patient in hospital developing severe disease - such as requiring ventilation - by 79%. Patients were two to three times more likely to recover to the point where everyday activities were not compromised by their illness, Synairgen claims. It said the trial also indicated ""very significant"" reductions in breathlessness among patients who received the treatment. In addition, the average time patients spent in hospital is said to have been reduced by a third, for those receiving the new drug - down from an average of nine days to six days. UK hospital trials new coronavirus treatment drug Life-saving coronavirus drug 'major breakthrough' Coronavirus anti-viral drug 'biggest step forward' How near are we to curing coronavirus? The double-blind trial involved 101 volunteers who had been admitted for treatment at nine UK hospitals for Covid-19 infections. Half of the participants were given the drug, the other half got what is known as a placebo - an inactive substance. Stock market rules mean Synairgen is obliged to report the preliminary results of the trial. The results have not been published in a peer-reviewed journal, nor has the full data been made available; so the BBC cannot confirm the claims made for the treatment. This video can not be played Professor Tom Wilkinson: ""These are all encouraging signals... that the drug is having an important clinical effect"" But if the results are as the company says, it will be a very important step forward in the treatment of coronavirus infections. The scientist in charge of the trial, Tom Wilkinson, says if the results are confirmed in larger studies the new treatment will be ""a game changer"". The trial was relatively small but the signal that the treatment benefits patients was unusually strong, he says. ""We couldn't have expected much better results than these,"" Synairgen chief executive Richard Marsden told the BBC. He described the results as ""a major breakthrough in the treatment of hospitalised Covid-19 patients"". The BBC's Justin Rowlatt with nurse Sandy Aitken at a patient's bedside Mr Marsden said the company will be presenting its findings to medical regulators around the world in the next couple of days to see what further information they require in order to approve the treatment. That process could take months, although the British government, like many others, has said it will work as fast as possible to get promising coronavirus treatments approved. It is possible it could be given emergency approval,as the anti-viral drug remdesivir was in May. Another possibility is that permission will be given for more patients to receive the treatment with the effects being carefully monitored to confirm it is safe and effective. If it does get approval, the drug and the nebulisers used to deliver it would then need to be manufactured in large quantities. Mr Marsden says he instructed companies to start producing supplies back in April to ensure they would be available should the results be positive. He says he expects Synairgen to be able to deliver ""a few 100,000"" doses a month by the winter. Interferon beta is part of the body's first line of defence against viruses, warning it to expect a viral attack. The coronavirus seems to suppress its production as part of its strategy to evade our immune systems. This video can not be played Synairgen CEO Richard Marsden explains how the treatment uses the protein interferon beta to help fight the virus The new drug is a special formulation of interferon beta delivered directly to the airways via a nebuliser which makes the protein into an aerosol. The idea is that a direct dose of the protein in the lungs will trigger a stronger anti-viral response, even in patients whose immune systems are already weak. Interferon beta is commonly used in the treatment of multiple sclerosis. Previous clinical trials conducted by Synairgen have shown that it can stimulate an immune response and that patients with asthma and other chronic lung conditions can comfortably tolerate the treatment. No-one involved in the trial knew which patients have been given which treatment until it was over. ""If you know it's a drug, your mind might have a bias,"" explained Sandy Aitken, one of the nurses who administered the new drug to patients at Southampton Hospital. Synairgen's drug trial was the template for the Accord programme, a fast-track clinical trial scheme set up by the UK government in April to accelerate the development of new drugs for patients with Covid-19. The Synairgen team believes the drug could be even more effective at the early stages of infection. A trial exploring the effects of giving patients who are in high-risk groups the new drug as soon as they are confirmed as having Covid-19 has struggled to find volunteers because there are so few new infections at the moment. Expert in emergency medicine Prof Steve Goodacre, from the University of Sheffield, said: ""These results are not interpretable. We need the full details and, perhaps more importantly, the trial protocol. The trial should have been registered and a protocol made available before any analysis was undertaken."" Prof Naveed Sattar, professor of metabolic medicine at the University of Glasgow, said: ""The results seem very impressive, and although accepted that the trial is small with just over 100 participants, a 79% reduction in disease severity could be a game changer. ""It would be good to see the full results once presented and peer-reviewed to make sure they are robust and the trial conduct was rigorous. Also, with small numbers comes less certainty on the true level of benefit, or whether benefits vary between people with differing risk characteristics. Such work would require a larger trial but, even so, these results are very exciting."" SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now?

Over the weekend more than 500 cars parked on mountain roads in Snowdonia, with people camping in laybys to hike up Snowdon. In Barmouth visitors blocked a potential rescue by parking on the lifeboat forecourt. The RNLI warned they were ""putting lives at risk"". Snowdonia National Park Authority said it was holding ""urgent talks"" to plan and agree a way forward after chaotic scenes near Snowdon. Helen Pye, of SNPA, said staff and volunteers said the number of visitors to Snowdon at the weekend ""was nothing like they'd ever seen before"". Allow Twitter content?

Snowdonia and the Brecon Beacons national parks were closed at the start of lockdown,after 'unprecedented' crowds flocked to Snowdon and Pen y fan despite advice against non-essential travel. Car parks and paths reopened in Snowdonia on 6 July to visitors for the first time after the stay local travel restrictions were lifted. On Sunday, pictures were shared on social media of cars parked along the side of the mountain road, as people flocked to hike to the highest peak in Wales. At Pen y pass 180 parking fines were issued on Sunday, theLocal Democracy Reporting Servicesaid. And by 08:16 BST on Monday, the Pen-y-Pass car park, the closest car park to the summit of Snowdon, in Gwynedd, was again full. Nia Jefferies, who had cycled from nearby Porthmadog on Sunday, said it was ""frightening"" as people had parked on bends, turning it into a ""single track"". ""There were walkers there, motorbikes there, cyclists and big campervans, and it was down to single file,"" the Gwynedd councillor said. ""It was the worst I've ever seen it, it was so scary, I was frightened."" Allow Facebook content? This article contains content provided by Facebook.

Ms Jefferies said people were camped in laybys, and theSherpa bus to bring hikers to the mountain,externalcould not get through due to the ""reckless parking"". Hundreds of people were fined by police, but with the fine only being about Â£30, Ms Jefferies said it was not a deterrent. ""People just think they want to go up it because it is the highest mountain in Wales, but there are so many other places,"" she added, calling for Visit Wales to actively promote other routes. Mess left at beauty spots 'unacceptable' Cardiff Bay police warning after 'unsavoury scenes' Ms Jefferies said while business owners were desperate for tourists to return to the area, people needed to respect the national park and think about the consequences of their actions. ""We are lucky we have the scenery, I know lockdown has been hard for people living in cities, but people are not respecting the environment or other people,"" she said. ""It was just so haphazard, fancy stopping on a mountain on a bend, and not thinking about the consequences, and just going for a walk, it's so selfish."" Tickets have been issued to some cars Plaid Cymru politicians said the scenes were ""truly shocking"" and called for a park and ride scheme to be brought in urgently. ""Nothing can excuse the behaviour of those who wantonly abandoned their vehicles on an exceptionally busy stretch of the A4086,"" they said in a statement. ""What events over the weekend underscored is that we cannot wait any longer for a lasting solution to this problem."" Snowdonia National Park Authority, Gwynedd and Conwy councils have been reviewing parking and transport for the area. Ms Jefferies said having a park and ride service could be a solution, to get people to spend in villages and towns, or passes for local residents. In Barmouth, Gwynedd, the RNLI said people had parked outside the lifeboat station, blocking spaces for volunteers. In a tweet the service said: ""We need this space for crew to park in case of a shout and to get the lifeboats out. ""You are potentially putting lives at risks parking here.""

Helen Pye said people were queuing at the top to reach Snowdon's summit Snowdonia National Park Authority said they were holding urgent talks with partners, including police and other national parks. Helen Pye, of SNPA, said: ""We've had things in place to cope with a busy period as lockdown eases, but there's only so much that one mountain can take.Â ""It's almost as if people are working out their pent up longing for open spaces and the countryside.Â ""It's lovely that people want to come and visit, but we do need everyone to check the car park situation before they arrive and park sensibly when they do.

"Thousands of fans attended the event, despite police appeals for mass gatherings to be avoided because of Covid-19 A huge clean-up operation has taken place after police officers were injured when thousands of Leeds United fans celebrated their club's promotion. One officer sustained a serious head injury during the event, attended by about 7,000 fans, after Leeds' Premier League promotion after 16 years. Bottles were thrown at officers and nine people were arrested for public order offences. Volunteers, including fans, joined council staff in cleaning up the area. Council staff were faced with mounds of rubbish in the city centre following Sunday's celebrations The clean-up operation took several hours to complete More news and stories from Yorkshire Sunday's city centre celebrations in Millennium Square came after fans had previously gathered on Friday and Saturday at the club's Elland Road ground. The club's promotion was confirmed on Friday, with the Championship title secured on Saturday after Brentford lost to Stoke. West Yorkshire Police said a female officer was being treated in hospital after sustaining a serious head injury. A number of other officers received minor injuries and 15 members of the public were also hurt, it added. This video can not be played Sunday saw 7,000 fans take to the city centre to celebrate Assistant Chief Constable Oz Khan said the force had continued to stress to fans the importance of Covid-19 precautions, appealing for large gatherings to be avoided and deploying officers to try to ensure the safety of those present. ""Almost 7,000 people gathered in Millennium Square in Leeds; whilst the vast majority of fans were enjoying themselves and celebrating, there were a small minority of people who began to throw bottles at police officers,"" he said. ""The safety of fans and the wider public is our primary concern. Violence towards police officers will not be tolerated and we deployed an appropriate police response to ensure that the festivities concluded safely."" Fans had been urged to stay at home if Leeds secured promotion The club's owner Andrea Radrizzani had urged fans to stay at home if Leeds secured promotion. He said he shared their desire to celebrate the club's success but did not believe what he had seen over the last 24 hours was responsible. ""Everybody wishes to get together and celebrate and we would love to open the stadium soon,"" he said. ""If we are not following the rules, if we take these superficially, then this might cause more cases, more problems and then we will have to postpone what we want which is to be back home at Elland Road as soon as possible."" Council staff were joined by volunteers, many of them fans, to clean up the area. This video can not be played Some fans helped council workers clean up the litter left at Millennium Square Volunteer Nick Moss, who did not attend the event on Sunday, said he was not surprised so many people decided to celebrate.

"Police officers detain protesters in Hong Kong during a rally against the new national security law Boris Johnson says the UK's extradition arrangements with Hong Kong will be changed, amid rising tensions with China. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab is expected to suspend an extradition deal with the territory later. It comes after Beijing imposed a controversialnational security lawon the ex-British colony, introducing new crimes with severe penalties. China has accused the UK of ""brutal meddling"" in its affairs. The UK has alreadyoffered residency rightsand a path to UK citizenship to around three million Hong Kongers in response to the law's imposition. Beijing has insisted it is committed to upholding international law, and has promised a ""resolute response"" if the UK withdraws from extradition arrangements. Why are the UK and China arguing about Hong Kong? UK makes citizenship offer to Hong Kong residents China's new law: Why is Hong Kong worried? The extradition treaty means that, if someone in Hong Kong is suspected of a crime in the UK, then the British authorities can ask Hong Kong to hand them over to face justice - and vice versa. The UK fears the arrangement - which has been in place for more than 30 years - could see anyone it extradites to Hong Kong being sent on to China. Hong Kong has extradition agreements with 19 other countries apart from the UK, including Canada andAustralia, which have already suspendedtheirs following the imposition there of China's new security law - which makes acts of subversion punishable by life sentences. Mr Johnson said the UK had ""concerns"" over the new law, and it had to think about the rights of people in Hong Kong to participate in democratic processes. But he added: ""There is a balance here. I'm not going to be pushed into a position of becoming a knee-jerk Sinophobe on every issue, somebody who is automatically anti-China"". ""We've got to have a calibrated approach. We're going to be tough on some things, but we're going to continue to engage."" The UK handed Hong Kong back to China in 1997 but, as part of an agreement signed at the time, it enjoys some freedoms not seen in the mainland. But political and economic relations between the UK and China have become strained in recent months. Earlier this month, the UK decided toban Chinese tech firm Huaweifrom its 5G network, citing security concerns denied by the company. The UK, US and EU have accused Beijing of undermining the ""One Country, Two Systems"" principle, which has guaranteed a high degree of autonomy for Hong Kong since it was handed back to Chinese rule in 1997. They say the security laws which came into force last month breach the terms of the1984 Joint Declaration,externalprotecting political and economic freedoms - which agreed the conditions under which Hong Kong would be run when Britain gave it back to China in 1997. Hong Kong timeline How is Hong Kong run? What is Huawei and why is it being banned? This video can not be played Tea, drugs and war: Hong Kong's British history explained The UK denounced the new lawsas ""deeply troubling"", with the foreign secretary calling the move ""a grave step"". In response, the UK has offered the 350,000 Hong Kong residents who hold British Overseas National passports - and a further 2.6 million who are eligible for them - enhanced residency rights should they wish to come to the UK and a route to possible citizenship. But China has warned it will retaliate if the UK imposes sanctions on any of its leading officials in relation to human rights offences and allegations of police brutality in Hong Kong. Proposals for an extradition treaty between Hong Kong and mainland China provoked widespread protests last year amid concerns about political interference in the Chinese judicial system and the right to a fair trial. Analysis by James Robbins, BBC Diplomatic Correspondent Suspending extradition to Hong Kong is a very obvious step to take. Even if the treaty remained fully in place, it would be hard to imagine the circumstances in which the UK would now agree to hand over any suspect to the Hong Kong authorities for trial - knowing they might end up in a Chinese mainland court, and then a prison far from Hong Kong. British suspension of the treaty - rather than outright abandonment - is quite normal. Diplomatically, it allows China a way back, however unlikely it is there will be any retreat by Beijing. The UK does not want to be the side to initiate a trade war with China, hence the focus on justice and the rule of law. China has already warned - in the context of Huawei as well as Hong Kong - that Chinese businesses may judge Britain an unsuitable or unreliable partner in future. The UK won't be the one turning up the heat in that area. But further British measures against China can't be ruled out. This video can not be played China's ambassador Liu Xiaoming: ""There is no such concentration camp in Xinjiang"" The UK has also stepped up its criticism of China's human rights record, accusing Beijing of ""gross and egregious"" abuses against the Uighur population in Xinjiang province. Mr Raab told the BBC that reports of forced sterilisation and wider persecution of the Muslim group were ""reminiscent of something not seen for a long time"". Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said his party would support a change to extradition arrangements with Hong Kong, calling it a ""step in the right direction"". But he called on the government to ""go further"" by considering immediate sanctions on Chinese officials involved in rights abuses against Uighur Muslims. UK accuses China of 'gross' abuses against Uighurs Who are the Uighurs? UK imposes sanctions against human rights abusers Drone footage that has been widely circulated - and authenticated by Australian security services - appears to show Uighurs being blindfolded and led to trains. However, China's UK ambassador, Liu Xiaoming,dismissed talks of concentration camps as ""fake"". On Monday Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said accusations of forced sterilisation of Uighurs in Xinjiang were ""nothing but lies"".

"West addressed the crowd without a microphone Kanye West has officially launched his campaign for the 2020 US presidential election, with an unorthodox rally in Charleston, South Carolina. West, 43, is running as a candidate for his self-styled ""Birthday Party"". At the event, the rapper seemed to make policy decisions off-the-cuff and made several rants, including on abortion and on abolitionist Harriet Tubman. Fans have questioned whether his last-minute bid for the White House is actually a promotional stunt. The Charleston rally did little to clarify whether his run is genuine. But a now-deleted tweet sent from West's account on Saturday, appearing to show the song list for a new album, added to the speculation. The event, held at a wedding and conference hall in the city, was said to be open to registered guests only - but West's campaign website had no function for people to register or RSVP. West appeared with ""2020"" shaved into the back of his head and wearing a protective security vest, and addressed the gathered crowd without a microphone. There were no audience microphones either, leading West to repeatedly tell the crowd to be silent so he could hear the questions being asked. This video can not be played Kanye West cried as he told the rally his father had wanted to abort him - and he ""almost killed"" his own daughter At one point he began crying when talking about abortion, saying that his parents almost aborted him: ""There would have been no Kanye West, because my dad was too busy."" He added: ""I almost killed my daughter... even if my wife [Kim Kardashian West] were to divorce me after this speech, she brought North into the world, even when I didn't want to."" Kanye West again says he will run for president Here's what President Kanye would do Kanye: 'I'm the greatest artist of all time' However he then added that he believes abortion should remain legal, but there should be financial support for struggling new mothers - suggesting that ""everybody that has a baby gets a million dollars"". ""The only thing that can free us is by obeying the rules that were given to us for a promised land,"" he said. ""Abortion should be legal because guess what? The law is not by God anyway, so what is legality?"" Kanye West became emotional when talking about his wife Kim Kardashian West and their children At another moment, he gave an impromptu monologue about 19th century abolitionist Harriet Tubman. ""Harriet Tubman never actually freed the slaves, she just had the slaves go work for other white people,"" he said. Tubman was born into slavery, but managed to escape a Maryland plantation in 1849, aged 27. She then returned to the South to rescue other slaves on the network of routes and safe houses known as ""underground railroad"", risking her own life to lead people to freedom. West also became tearful when talking about his late mother, who died in 2007 from complications during cosmetic surgery. The speech has been met with anger by some - mostly sparked by his comments about Tubman - but also with concern over West's welfare. Professor Jason Nichols, a senior lecturer in African American studies at the University of Maryland, told the BBC he feared West's rambling appearance pointed towards a ""manic episode"" - although he acknowledged he was not a psychologist. ""He has admitted in the past he has been battling mental illness and that sometimes he does not take medication. ""He was a little more coherent than he has been in other times... when he has gone on these rants, but I really believe he is in a bad place right now. He said some really bizarre things."" Professor Nichols added that he was disappointed, as he had hoped West would be able ""to push the other candidates"", had he had the right advice and support. ""I was actually interested to see what would happen, but after the event today, all that interest has just turned to worry."" West, who announced his candidacy on 4 July, has already missed the deadline to qualify for the ballot in several states. He needs to collect enough signatures to appear on the ballot in a number of others. Last week he qualified to appear on Oklahoma's presidential ballot, the first state where he met the requirements before the deadline. In order to appear on South Carolina's ballot he needs to collect 10,000 signatures by noon local time (18:00 BST) on Monday.

"Face masks are now mandatory in all enclosed public spaces, including shops France has made face masks compulsory in all enclosed public spaces amid a fresh bout of Covid-19 outbreaks. Masks were already mandatory on public transport, but from Monday they must also be worn in places like shops. Health Minister Oliver VÃ©ran warned that France had between ""400 and 500 active clusters"" of the virus. President Emmanuel Macron declared a ""first victory"" over the virus in June and has ended the national state of emergency, but local outbreaks remain. There are a rising number of cases in the north-west and in eastern regions, in particular in the north-western department of Mayenne. France, one of Europe's hardest-hit countries, has recorded more than 200,000 infections and over 30,000 deaths since the start of the pandemic. Face masks are now compulsory in all enclosed public spaces, including shops where previously owners were able to decide themselves whether customers should wear coverings or not. Anyone caught without a mask faces a fine of â¬135 (Â£123; $154). Authorities in Mayenne began calling for mandatory mask restrictions last week as cases soared in the department. Public health agency SantÃ© Publique France issued a warning for Mayenne after it passed the alert threshold of 50 new cases per 100,000 inhabitants in a week. Across France as a whole, that figure is about 10 per 100,000 inhabitants. France's health workers given 'historic' pay rises France honours health workers on Bastille Day Other regions are also worrying authorities. Brittany in the north-west of France has a reproduction number of 2.6 - meaning each infected person is passing on the virus to nearly three more. The eastern department of Vosges is also seeing rising cases, while the R number in Marseille and Nice is reportedly at 1.55. This video can not be played What is the R number and what does it mean? Mr VÃ©ran plans to travel to Mayenne later on Monday. While the country is ""very far"" from a second wave, he told broadcaster France Info that there were ""worrying signs of epidemic resumption"". ""We must remain vigilant,"" he said, noting that people had become weary of the restrictions and wanted to return to normal life. ""All options are on the table"" if local outbreaks worsen, he added, including regional lockdowns or even the return of national restrictions. France's ancient burial brotherhood defies Covid-19 The 98-year-old doctor working through lockdown Overall the outbreak is broadly under control across France. But a number of public health officials have warned of a potential second wave, and the government has begun stockpiling hundreds of millions of masks. Though countries had relaxed restrictions brought in to contain the spread of the virus, many across the continent have been forced to impose local lockdowns or even bring back national measures as infections have risen again. Spain's north-eastern region ofCatalonia has asked millions of its citizens to stay at home, with new cases threatening to overwhelm local health systems. Beach trip for Barcelona coronavirus patients Spain to cull almost 100,000 mink in Covid scare French Prime Minister Jean Castex said the country could close its border with Spain due to the rising number of local outbreaks. Cases are soaring in the Balkans Infections are also soaring throughout the Balkans. Bosnia-Herzegovina reported almost 300 new cases on Sunday, and a number of politicians have fallen ill with the virus - including former President Dragan Covic and the prime ministers of its two entities, the Federation and the Republika Srpska. Serbia, Albania and Montenegro are also reporting large rises in confirmed cases. Montenegro currently has about 195 cases per 100,000 residents - the highest number in the region.

"Beefeaters and other iconic uniformed staff are facing job cuts at the Tower of London Beefeaters guarding the Tower of London face ""heartbreaking"" redundancies to cut costs following a drop in visitors. The pandemic forced the closure of six sites run by Historic Royal Palaces (HRP), and ""dealt a devastating blow"" to its finances, bosses said. The Tower attracted nearly three million visitors in 2018, making it the UK's most popular paid for attraction. HRP confirmed a voluntary redundancy scheme was in place and compulsory redundancies were likely to follow. The organisation believes it is the first time the guards have faced redundancy since the unit was formed by Henry VII in 1485. John Barnes, HRP's chief executive, said: ""Historic Royal Palaces is a self-funded charity. We depend on visitors for 80% of our income. ""We are heartbroken it has come to this. ""We have taken every possible measure to secure our financial position, but we need to do more to survive in the long term. ""We simply have no choice but to reduce our payroll costs."" Six sites run by Historic Royal Palaces temporarily closed due to the pandemic The temporary closure to visitors has created a Â£98m shortfall this year, HRP said.

"Beefeaters and other iconic uniformed staff are facing job cuts at the Tower of London Beefeaters guarding the Tower of London face ""heartbreaking"" redundancies to cut costs following a drop in visitors. The pandemic forced the closure of six sites run by Historic Royal Palaces (HRP), and ""dealt a devastating blow"" to its finances, bosses said. The Tower attracted nearly three million visitors in 2018, making it the UK's most popular paid for attraction. HRP confirmed a voluntary redundancy scheme was in place and compulsory redundancies were likely to follow. The organisation believes it is the first time the guards have faced redundancy since the unit was formed by Henry VII in 1485. John Barnes, HRP's chief executive, said: ""Historic Royal Palaces is a self-funded charity. We depend on visitors for 80% of our income. ""We are heartbroken it has come to this. ""We have taken every possible measure to secure our financial position, but we need to do more to survive in the long term. ""We simply have no choice but to reduce our payroll costs."" Six sites run by Historic Royal Palaces temporarily closed due to the pandemic The temporary closure to visitors has created a Â£98m shortfall this year, HRP said. This is made up of current losses, the high maintenance costs of heating and providing electricity to large properties, and an expected slow recovery in tourism. Last year it cost HRP Â£32m to run its six sites, which include Hampton Court Palace and Kensington Palace.

"This video can not be played PM Boris Johnson says the new law ""violates Hong Kong's high degree of autonomy"" Up to three million Hong Kong residents are to be offered the chance to settle in the UK and ultimately apply for citizenship, Boris Johnson has said. The PM said Hong Kong's freedoms were being violated by a new security law and those affected would be offered a ""route"" out of the former UK colony. About 350,000 UK passport holders, and 2.6 million others eligible, will be able to come to the UK for five years. And after a further year, they will be able to apply for citizenship. British National Overseas Passport holders in Hong Kong were granted special status in the 1980s but currently have restricted rights and are only entitled to visa-free access to the UK for six months. Under the government's plans, all British Overseas Nationals and their dependants will be given right to remain in the UK, including the right to work and study, for five years. At this point, they will be able to apply for settled status, and after a further year, seek citizenship. UK asylum for consulate worker 'tortured in China' HK arrests dozens as 'anti-protest' law kicks in Political battle looming over UK China relations China's new law: Why is Hong Kong worried? The PM said Tuesday's passing of a new security law by the Hong Kong authorities was a ""clear and serious breach"" of the 1985 Sino-British joint declaration - a legally binding agreement which set out how certain freedoms would be protected for the 50 years after China assumed sovereignty in 1997. ""It violates Hong Kong's high degree of autonomy and threatens the freedoms and rights protected by the joint declaration,"" he said. ""We made clear that if China continued down this path we would introduce a new route for those with British National (Overseas) status to enter the UK, granting them limited leave to remain with the ability to live and work in the UK and thereafter to apply for citizenship. And that is precisely what we will do now."" Foreign Office permanent secretary Sir Simon McDonald expressed the government's ""deep concern"" about the new law to China during a meeting with the country's ambassador Liu Xioming. The UK government has been raising concerns about the national security law and very publicly trying to pressure Beijing into a change heart. That has clearly failed - so ministers are now fulfilling their promise to allow some three million British Overseas Nationals to come to the UK. This is a significant move and the government wants to send a strong message. But there will be more pressure now to rethink other elements of our relationship with China - not least the deal to allow Huawei to build parts of the UK's 5G structures. Many Tory MPs have been lobbying against that for some time - and this will only add to their concern. Updating MPs on the details, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said there would be no limit on numbers or quotas and the application process would be simple. ""This is a special, bespoke, set of arrangements developed for the unique circumstances we face and in light of our historic commitment to the people of Hong Kong,"" he said. Speaking to ITV's Peston programme, Mr Raab acknowledged there ""would be little we could do toâ¦cohesively force"" China to allow British Overseas Nationals to come to the UK. What is a BNO passport? The background you need on Hong Kong's protests What is behind the Hong Kong citizenship offer? Downing Street said further details of the scheme will be detailed ""in due course"". In the meantime, British National Overseas Passport holders in Hong Kong will be able to travel to the UK immediately, subject to standard immigration checks, the prime minister's official spokesman said. They will also will not face salary thresholds to gain their visas, he added. Hong Kong's new national security law, which targets secession, subversion and terrorism with punishments up to life in prison, came into effect on Tuesday. By Grace Tsoi, BBC World Service, Hong Kong I was born in Hong Kong before 1997, the year when Hong Kong was handed back to Chinese rule. That means I had a British National Overseas (BNO) passport as a child. When the news broke that BNO passport holders were eligible for British citizenship after living and working in the UK for five years, and after spending another year of being granted settled status, many of my friends were excited. They say at least there's a way out for Hong Kongers after the national security law came into force. But many questions remain. Currently there are 350,000 BNO passport holders, but about three million Hong Kong residents are eligible for BNO passports - and that doesn't appear to include dependants born after 1997. Will the UK be ready to take in so many Hong Kong residents? Will there be enough jobs? Will BNO passport holders have recourse to public funds? And will they be covered by the NHS? Some also say it's good that there's a lifeboat, but do they really want to leave their home? Several people have already been arrested under the new powers, including a man carrying a pro-independence flag as police used pepper spray to disperse some protesters gathered to mark 23 years since British rule ended. Critics say it effectively puts an end to the ""one country, two systems"" principle enshrined in the Joint Declaration. China has rejected criticism of its actions, saying they are internal matters. British National Overseas Passports do not confer nationality or the automatic right to live and work in the UK The UK government has come under growing pressure to take a firm line with Beijing from MPs, who are worried about China's increasingly assertive role regionally and the security implications of Chinese firm Huawei's involvement in the UK's 5G network. This video can not be played Hong Kong residents on controversial security law Mr Raab said he wanted a positive relationship with China but Beijing had ""broken its promise"" to the people of Hong Kong through its ""flagrant assault"" on freedom of speech and right of peaceful assembly. Labour said it welcomed the government's action but said there must be no discrimination on those allowed into the UK on the basis of income or other factors. Shadow foreign secretary Lisa Nandy said the UK also had a responsibility to consider the welfare of those who were not able to re-locate or who wished to stay in Hong Kong. She urged the government to work with its international partners, through the UN, to force an inquiry into police brutality in Hong Kong and also called for the UK to re-examine its commercial relationship with China. ""For too long in relation to China we've had no strategy at home and no strategy abroad. I hope he can give us a commitment today that this marks the start of a very different era,"" she said.

"Police officers detain protesters in Hong Kong during a rally against the new national security law Boris Johnson says the UK's extradition arrangements with Hong Kong will be changed, amid rising tensions with China. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab is expected to suspend an extradition deal with the territory later. It comes after Beijing imposed a controversialnational security lawon the ex-British colony, introducing new crimes with severe penalties. China has accused the UK of ""brutal meddling"" in its affairs. The UK has alreadyoffered residency rightsand a path to UK citizenship to around three million Hong Kongers in response to the law's imposition. Beijing has insisted it is committed to upholding international law, and has promised a ""resolute response"" if the UK withdraws from extradition arrangements. Why are the UK and China arguing about Hong Kong? UK makes citizenship offer to Hong Kong residents China's new law: Why is Hong Kong worried? The extradition treaty means that, if someone in Hong Kong is suspected of a crime in the UK, then the British authorities can ask Hong Kong to hand them over to face justice - and vice versa. The UK fears the arrangement - which has been in place for more than 30 years - could see anyone it extradites to Hong Kong being sent on to China. Hong Kong has extradition agreements with 19 other countries apart from the UK, including Canada andAustralia, which have already suspendedtheirs following the imposition there of China's new security law - which makes acts of subversion punishable by life sentences. Mr Johnson said the UK had ""concerns"" over the new law, and it had to think about the rights of people in Hong Kong to participate in democratic processes. But he added: ""There is a balance here. I'm not going to be pushed into a position of becoming a knee-jerk Sinophobe on every issue, somebody who is automatically anti-China"". ""We've got to have a calibrated approach. We're going to be tough on some things, but we're going to continue to engage."" The UK handed Hong Kong back to China in 1997 but, as part of an agreement signed at the time, it enjoys some freedoms not seen in the mainland. But political and economic relations between the UK and China have become strained in recent months. Earlier this month, the UK decided toban Chinese tech firm Huaweifrom its 5G network, citing security concerns denied by the company. The UK, US and EU have accused Beijing of undermining the ""One Country, Two Systems"" principle, which has guaranteed a high degree of autonomy for Hong Kong since it was handed back to Chinese rule in 1997. They say the security laws which came into force last month breach the terms of the1984 Joint Declaration,externalprotecting political and economic freedoms - which agreed the conditions under which Hong Kong would be run when Britain gave it back to China in 1997. Hong Kong timeline How is Hong Kong run? What is Huawei and why is it being banned? This video can not be played Tea, drugs and war: Hong Kong's British history explained The UK denounced the new lawsas ""deeply troubling"", with the foreign secretary calling the move ""a grave step"". In response, the UK has offered the 350,000 Hong Kong residents who hold British Overseas National passports - and a further 2.6 million who are eligible for them - enhanced residency rights should they wish to come to the UK and a route to possible citizenship. But China has warned it will retaliate if the UK imposes sanctions on any of its leading officials in relation to human rights offences and allegations of police brutality in Hong Kong. Proposals for an extradition treaty between Hong Kong and mainland China provoked widespread protests last year amid concerns about political interference in the Chinese judicial system and the right to a fair trial. Analysis by James Robbins, BBC Diplomatic Correspondent Suspending extradition to Hong Kong is a very obvious step to take. Even if the treaty remained fully in place, it would be hard to imagine the circumstances in which the UK would now agree to hand over any suspect to the Hong Kong authorities for trial - knowing they might end up in a Chinese mainland court, and then a prison far from Hong Kong. British suspension of the treaty - rather than outright abandonment - is quite normal. Diplomatically, it allows China a way back, however unlikely it is there will be any retreat by Beijing. The UK does not want to be the side to initiate a trade war with China, hence the focus on justice and the rule of law. China has already warned - in the context of Huawei as well as Hong Kong - that Chinese businesses may judge Britain an unsuitable or unreliable partner in future. The UK won't be the one turning up the heat in that area. But further British measures against China can't be ruled out. This video can not be played China's ambassador Liu Xiaoming: ""There is no such concentration camp in Xinjiang"" The UK has also stepped up its criticism of China's human rights record, accusing Beijing of ""gross and egregious"" abuses against the Uighur population in Xinjiang province. Mr Raab told the BBC that reports of forced sterilisation and wider persecution of the Muslim group were ""reminiscent of something not seen for a long time"". Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said his party would support a change to extradition arrangements with Hong Kong, calling it a ""step in the right direction"". But he called on the government to ""go further"" by considering immediate sanctions on Chinese officials involved in rights abuses against Uighur Muslims.

UK imposes sanctions against human rights abusers Drone footage that has been widely circulated - and authenticated by Australian security services - appears to show Uighurs being blindfolded and led to trains. However, China's UK ambassador, Liu Xiaoming,dismissed talks of concentration camps as ""fake"".

But here's a quick recap of some of the main stories:  The UK economyhas ""clawed back"" about half the fall in output it saw during the peak of the coronavirus lockdownin March and April, according to the Bank of England's chief economist. Andy Haldane told MPs there had been a ""V"" shaped ""bounceback"". Last month, Mr Haldane said the economy was ""on track for a quick recovery"" - the so-called ""V"" shape. However, other economists have expressed doubts about the potential for such a swift recovery in activity. ""Roughly half of the roughly 25% fall in activity during March and April has been clawed back over the period since,"" Mr Haldane told members of the Treasury Select Committee. The economy had grown by about 1% per week, he said. ""We have seen a bounceback. So far, it has been a 'V'. That of course doesn't tell us about where we might go next,"" he added. As cases surge in a number of US states, more than a dozen National Football League (NFL) players have taken to social media to demand clarification of Covid-19 policies to keep players and their families safe. Stars including Seattle Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson and Houston Texans player JJ Watt used the Twitter hashtag #WeWantToPlay to question the NFL's safety plan as players are told to report for training camps across the country. Wilson tweeted on Sunday: ""My wife is pregnant. NFL training camp is about to start.. And there's still No Clear Plan on Player Health & Family Safety."" Infectious disease experts have put together response plans for the league's 32 teams, according to USA Today Sports. Protocols negotiated by the league and players' association include mask requirements, hand sanitising and minimising shared equipment. But players say they still have not been told how the league will handle a positive Covid-19 test among teammates, whether they can opt-out of high-risk situations, or if there will be access to daily testing, among other concerns. At least 72 NFL players have tested positive for the virus thus far, according to the players' association. So far, the NFL plans for teams to begin training camps for the next few weeks before the season begins in September. Teams will travel as they normally did, but there will be limits on the number of fans in the stadiums. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

In Texas - one of America's virus hotspots, with over 335,000 cases - the state attorney general has said that religious schools are exempt from local health restrictions. On Friday, Attorney General Ken Paxton wrote in an open letter that it would be unconstitutional to require religious schools to close under any government orders. He cited the First Amendment, which protects religious freedoms, as well as the Texas governor's, which prohibits local governments ""from closing religious institutions or dictating mitigation strategies to those institutions"". ""Religious private schools
may continue to determine when it is safe for their communities to resume in-person
instruction free from any government mandate or interference,"" Paxton said. ""Religious private
schools therefore need not comply with local public health orders to the contrary."" The guidance comes as schools across the US's second most populous state are trying to determine how to reopen amid a Covid-19 surge, with many educators saying they are afraid to resume in-person classes. Days after the attorney general's letter, and after five consecutive days of more than 10,000 new Covid-19 cases, Texas Governor Greg Abbott said US Navy medical teams have been deployed in the state to assist with battling the virus. This video can not be played Why Texas is seeing a surge in coronavirus cases Will GrantBBC News, Havana The Cuban health ministry has announced there has been no local transmission of coronavirus on the island for the first time in more than four months. There was just one case of Covid-19 registered in the past 24-hours - however, the government said the patient had travelled into Cuba from abroad. The Cuban government has been praised by the Pan American Health Organization for its robust response to the pandemic. Face masks are mandatory in most settings and the island is only very cautiously reopening under a gradual three-phased approach. Havana is currently in phase one with many economic and social activities suspended. Inter-province travel can begin again under phase two and children will only return to classes once phase three has been declared. People in Southwold say its summer visitors are returning As the UK went into lockdown, the seaside town of Southwold was pleading with visitors to stay away from its pier, golden sands and promenade lined with candy-coloured beach huts. Banners around town said that trips to the seaside or to second homes were not essential travel. ""Please respect us - don't infect us,"" they said. Nowthey're trying to encourage visitors back. At ice cream shop Beaches and Cream, Lynda Walker said the banners could not have been made by a business owner. ""We want to see holidaymakers - they're our bread and butter and we are glad they are back."" Some said the town already has ""that busy summer feeling"" but others like market stallholder Darren Crane worry that ""we haven't got many weeks left to make the money to get through the winter."" Meanwhile, officials in Wales say beauty spots are experiencing the opposite problem â they'reso overrun by visitors enjoying their restored freedom that the crowds of parked cars are ""putting lives at risk"". While outdoor dining has been allowed, indoor dining remains prohibited in New  York City New York City, once the epicentre of the pandemic in the US, is now entering the last phase of reopening - albeit with some modifications. It's the last region of the state to do so. Mayor Bill de Blasio said indoor dining and drinking would still not be allowed to resume and indoor venues like museums would remain closed. Other outdoor entertainment and sites, like professional sports, botanical gardens and zoos, can reopen with reduced capacity. Film and television production has also been given the go-ahead. It is unclear when indoor-only facilities will be allowed to reopen. The city and state are also still working on a plan to restart schools. Also on Monday, New York's Governor Andrew Cuomo will visit the southern state of Georgia, one of the states seeing a recent rise in Covid-19. Cuomo said he will meet with officials in Savannah, Georgia, to offer guidance and help with testing and tracing programmes as well as to deliver personal protective equipment. Cuomo said that health workers from across the country offered help to New York when his state was in the thick of it, and promised to repay the generosity.

Chris MasonPolitical Correspondent Coaches descend on Westminster Dozens of coaches have spent the afternoon making themselves heard in Westminster. They've been driving round in circles in Parliament Square blasting their horns - the industry says they have been forgotten by the government during the pandemic. I asked the Department for Transport for its reaction earlier this afternoon. A spokesman said the government has rovided a generous and wide-ranging package of support for businesses. ""Our job retention scheme has helped a million employers and protected more
than nine million jobs across the U.K. We have extended it until October â
meaning it will have been open for eight months and will continue to
support businesses as the economy reopens and people return to work,"" they said. They also highlighted other support measures like bounce back
loans, tax deferrals, business rates holidays and more than Â£10 billion of
grants. âLast week the Chancellor announced the second part of our support
for the economy through his Plan for Jobs, giving businesses the confidence to
retain and hire, and providing people with the tools they need to get better
jobs, including supporting jobs with a Â£1,000 Coronavirus Job Retention Bonus
for employers.â The coach industry wants help that is specifically tailored to them. Today's demonstration will no doubt not be the last - loads of industries are hurting and hurting badly, in a recession without precedent in modern times. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst An anti-mask protest that took place in Londonâs Hyde Park over the weekend is being widely mocked in China today, a country wheremandatory mask wearing because of Covid-19 has been part and parcel since the beginning of the year. Thousands have taken to Chinaâs Facebook-equivalent Sina Weibo, mocking resistance in England towards masks as a perceived restriction of freedom, even though wearing one will become mandatory in shops and supermarkets from 24 July. It comes at a time when relations between China and the UK are especially strained, withthe UK terminating its agreement with Chinese tech giant Huawei for 5G infrastructure last week, andthe UK government changing its extradition arrangements with Hong Kong. âLet them watch the âfreedomâ they value collapse,â one Weibo user says, and many speculate resistance could lead to a second wave in the country. Others joke the English are being brainwashed by conspiracy theories. âNo masks, no 5G, no vaccines = no lives,â one says. Some call the activists âapprentices of [US President] Trumpâ.

WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus The World Health Organization (WHO) has welcomed today's progress towards a vaccine but says work still needs to be done to combat the spread of Covid-19. At a briefing in Geneva, Dr Mike Ryan, director of the WHO emergencies programme, congratulated the scientists behindthe Oxford vaccine, saying: ""This is a positive result but again there is a long way to go."" He added that now, ""real world"" trials must be done on a larger scale. There are 23 potential vaccines in development thus far. ""But it is good to see more data and more products moving into this very important phase of vaccine discovery."" WHO chief Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus also emphasised that any successful vaccines must be accessible to all. He said many countries are seeing the advantages of making the vaccine ""a global public good"", but some are ""going the reverse direction"". ""When there is no consensus, it could be actually owned by those who have money and those who cannot afford it may not have access to the vaccines.""

Mr Trump gave 35 daily briefings with the White House's coronavirus task force in March and April, but frequently came under criticism for providing false or misleading statements. In turn, he accused the media of bias. He said the revival of briefings would allow him to share ""positive things"" his administration is doing, and updates on vaccines and treatments. ""I think itâs a great way to get information out to the public,"" the president told reporters. ""We had a lot of people watching, record numbers watching in the history of cable television, and thereâs never been anything like it.""

A further 11 deaths have been recorded in the UK, bringing the total number of people who died in hospital, care homes and the community after a positive coronavirus test to 45,312. According tocoronavirus.data.gov.uk,external, there were also 580 new positive tests in the last 24 hours, continuing a trend in recent days when the fall in cases appears to have levelled out. It comes after the Department of Health has ordered a review into the UK-wide daily death statistics, after concerns that figures contributed by England may include deaths which occur months after a positive test. Other UK nations have a 28-day cut-off point. But Public Health England is continuing to make the figures available on the coronavirus data dashboard. It says that about 4,000 of the 45,000 deaths occurred after more than 28 days, and only 2,000 of those were not attributed by the recording doctor to Covid-19. Miami Beach has enacted a curfew amid rising cases Florida has reported its fifth consecutive day of more than 10,000 new Covid-19 cases.

More on Florida: BBC OS Lydia Guthrie said she doesn't feel ""brave or selfless"" taking part in the trial One of those who volunteered to take part in the Oxford University vaccine trial is Lydia Guthrie. She was injected on April 30th with either the experimental Covid-19 vaccine or a placebo vaccine that protects against meningitis. Lydia says she developed flu-like symptoms after having her vaccine, but was warned by the research team that this might happen. Despite the small risk that was involved, she toldBBC OS on World Service radiothat she doesnât feel âbrave or selflessâ. âItâs not that brave because I trust the people involved. Itâs also not selfless because if we find a vaccine, I will benefit just as much as anybody else,"" said Lydia. âIf we get a vaccine Iâll be able to hug my mum again, and thatâs really worth it for me.â James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News These results from the Oxford vaccine trial are exciting, but
this is only the first hurdle. It is still not a vaccine we can say âworksâ. It is great news the vaccine can induce an immune response, including both antibodies that attack the virus and
T-cells, which hunt out and kill cells infected by the virus. But we do not know what level of
immune response is needed to protect people from coronavirus. That is why
further research is still needed. The answers at the moment are
unlikely to come from the UK as there is not enough coronavirus doing the
rounds to prove whether the vaccine is making a difference. The Oxford team already has
trials under way in South Africa and Brazil and there are plans for one in the
US too. However, it may yet require
âchallenge trialsâ in which people are vaccinated and deliberately infected

"Grace Dembowicz is one of 500,000 university leavers looking for work More than one in every six young people is now claiming out-of-work benefits in some parts of the UK, BBC analysis of official figures suggests. The number of people aged 18-24 claiming Universal Credit or Jobseeker's Allowance doubled in the UK in the last three months. Parts of Liverpool and Blackpool have been worst hit, with closures of pubs, cafes and restaurants all contributing. Chancellor Rishi Sunak has announced a Â£2bn scheme to help young workers. In the UK, 2.6 million people are currently claiming Universal Credit or Jobseekers' Allowance and are required to ""seek work"". A fifth of those - 514,770 young people - are aged between 18 and 24. The number of young new claimants who have signed on between March and June is 276,000 - more than doubling over three months. Young workers: 'We've been overlooked' What was in the summer statement? How did the government try to help in 2009? The Walton area of Liverpool is among the most deprived parts of the UK. About 7,500 people there are aged between 18 and 24 and its economy is largely dominated by small retail. But the BBC analysis shows 19% of people in that age bracket are now claiming benefits - making it the worst-hit constituency in the UK. Andrew Adams, 21, has lived in the city all his life and has a degree in promotional design. Currently, he is sending out between four and five job applications a week with no success. ""At the moment I'm just looking for admin work, warehouse stuff, desk work - nothing to do with my degree at all,"" he said. ""I'm just getting no response. It makes me feel kind of hopeless at the moment. ""Once I got my degree I thought it would be smooth sailing, but it isn't at the moment."" Andrew is currently taking on extra training from the Merseyside Youth Association, which helps to get the long-term unemployed back to work. Its chief executive Gill Bainbridge said many in the city had become eligible for Universal Credit because their work hours have been cut. ""Liverpool had a high level of unemployment to start with,"" she said. ""Its economy is built around visitors and the hospitality industry. A lot of these have been impacted quite directly. The trouble we are having now is it is so competitive. ""If Andrew is finding it tough with those qualifications, imagine what it's like if you have low-level literacy and come from a difficult background?"" In London, Grace Dembowicz, a recent journalism masters graduate, finished a course at the end of June and says she has been applying for jobs throughout lockdown. The 22-year-old is one of 500,000 young people who will leave education this year and enter a labour market hit by recession and with a shrinking number of apprenticeships available. ""I was offered interviews, but they said it would be on commission as they don't have money for full-time pay,"" she said. ""Being realistic, I finished my masters thinking I would get into a newsroom straight away but it's becoming more realistic that it will take a couple years to get to that stage."" Andrew Adams is applying for five jobs a week in Liverpool BBC analysis has found there are now nearly 50 constituencies in the UK with more than 15% of their young population claiming out-of-work benefits. Affluent areas such as South West Surrey, Henley and Windsor have even seen a surge in the number of young claimants under lockdown, though many of these are likely to have become eligible as a result of being furloughed. According to the Resolution Foundation, one-third of employees aged 18-24 have lost jobs or been furloughed during the pandemic, compared to one-in-six adults above that age. Another think tank, the Institute for Fiscal Studies, says younger people are more likely to be employed in jobs where they cannot work from home. Prof Guy Michaels, from the London School of Economics, said the loss of the service industry since March had removed the pathway into employment for swathes of young people. ""It offers people work even if they don't have a huge amount of experience or completed formal skills,"" he said. ""This means that young people really lost this stepping stone that they take in the start of their careers."" Although Prof Michaels has welcomed the government measures, he said they might need to stay in place for years. He also said the success of the incentives being offered are highly dependent on job vacancies being available in the first place. ""After the last recession it took quite a few years for the youth unemployment to recover,"" he said. ""It might take three or four years to start coming down in this instance. ""Each recession is different but there is a worry that this isn't going to go anywhere quickly."" Laura-Jane Rawlings, chief executive of Youth Employment UK, said the incentive scheme would need to stay in place for a long time to be effective. Her organisation has seen 400,000 young people apply for career help over the last three months. ""There can be a scarring of individuals that enter at this time. It's not just about having one or two bad years it can be persistent,"" she said. ""The people hit the most are people from disadvantaged backgrounds."" Last week, the government announced a ""kickstart scheme"" to pay for six-month work placements for 16 to 24-year-olds on Universal Credit. The chancellor said the plan was aimed at preventing an entire generation being ""left behind"". A spokesman for the Department for Work and Pensions said the government recognised it was an uncertain time for many young people.  As well as the kickstart scheme, it was scaling up training and apprenticeship support, and boosting support from youth employment coaches, the spokesman said.

and Claire Heald. Do join us again tomorrow. We're wrapping up today's live page shortly. But here's a quick recap of some of the main stories:  The UK economyhas ""clawed back"" about half the fall in output it saw during the peak of the coronavirus lockdownin March and April, according to the Bank of England's chief economist. Andy Haldane told MPs there had been a ""V"" shaped ""bounceback"". Last month, Mr Haldane said the economy was ""on track for a quick recovery"" - the so-called ""V"" shape. However, other economists have expressed doubts about the potential for such a swift recovery in activity. ""Roughly half of the roughly 25% fall in activity during March and April has been clawed back over the period since,"" Mr Haldane told members of the Treasury Select Committee. The economy had grown by about 1% per week, he said. ""We have seen a bounceback. So far, it has been a 'V'. That of course doesn't tell us about where we might go next,"" he added. As cases surge in a number of US states, more than a dozen National Football League (NFL) players have taken to social media to demand clarification of Covid-19 policies to keep players and their families safe. Stars including Seattle Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson and Houston Texans player JJ Watt used the Twitter hashtag #WeWantToPlay to question the NFL's safety plan as players are told to report for training camps across the country. Wilson tweeted on Sunday: ""My wife is pregnant. NFL training camp is about to start.. And there's still No Clear Plan on Player Health & Family Safety."" Infectious disease experts have put together response plans for the league's 32 teams, according to USA Today Sports. Protocols negotiated by the league and players' association include mask requirements, hand sanitising and minimising shared equipment. But players say they still have not been told how the league will handle a positive Covid-19 test among teammates, whether they can opt-out of high-risk situations, or if there will be access to daily testing, among other concerns. At least 72 NFL players have tested positive for the virus thus far, according to the players' association. So far, the NFL plans for teams to begin training camps for the next few weeks before the season begins in September. Teams will travel as they normally did, but there will be limits on the number of fans in the stadiums. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

In Texas - one of America's virus hotspots, with over 335,000 cases - the state attorney general has said that religious schools are exempt from local health restrictions. On Friday, Attorney General Ken Paxton wrote in an open letter that it would be unconstitutional to require religious schools to close under any government orders. He cited the First Amendment, which protects religious freedoms, as well as the Texas governor's, which prohibits local governments ""from closing religious institutions or dictating mitigation strategies to those institutions"". ""Religious private schools
may continue to determine when it is safe for their communities to resume in-person
instruction free from any government mandate or interference,"" Paxton said. ""Religious private
schools therefore need not comply with local public health orders to the contrary."" The guidance comes as schools across the US's second most populous state are trying to determine how to reopen amid a Covid-19 surge, with many educators saying they are afraid to resume in-person classes. Days after the attorney general's letter, and after five consecutive days of more than 10,000 new Covid-19 cases, Texas Governor Greg Abbott said US Navy medical teams have been deployed in the state to assist with battling the virus. This video can not be played Why Texas is seeing a surge in coronavirus cases Will GrantBBC News, Havana The Cuban health ministry has announced there has been no local transmission of coronavirus on the island for the first time in more than four months. There was just one case of Covid-19 registered in the past 24-hours - however, the government said the patient had travelled into Cuba from abroad. The Cuban government has been praised by the Pan American Health Organization for its robust response to the pandemic. Face masks are mandatory in most settings and the island is only very cautiously reopening under a gradual three-phased approach. Havana is currently in phase one with many economic and social activities suspended. Inter-province travel can begin again under phase two and children will only return to classes once phase three has been declared. People in Southwold say its summer visitors are returning As the UK went into lockdown, the seaside town of Southwold was pleading with visitors to stay away from its pier, golden sands and promenade lined with candy-coloured beach huts. Banners around town said that trips to the seaside or to second homes were not essential travel. ""Please respect us - don't infect us,"" they said. Nowthey're trying to encourage visitors back. At ice cream shop Beaches and Cream, Lynda Walker said the banners could not have been made by a business owner. ""We want to see holidaymakers - they're our bread and butter and we are glad they are back."" Some said the town already has ""that busy summer feeling"" but others like market stallholder Darren Crane worry that ""we haven't got many weeks left to make the money to get through the winter."" Meanwhile, officials in Wales say beauty spots are experiencing the opposite problem â they'reso overrun by visitors enjoying their restored freedom that the crowds of parked cars are ""putting lives at risk"". While outdoor dining has been allowed, indoor dining remains prohibited in New  York City New York City, once the epicentre of the pandemic in the US, is now entering the last phase of reopening - albeit with some modifications. It's the last region of the state to do so. Mayor Bill de Blasio said indoor dining and drinking would still not be allowed to resume and indoor venues like museums would remain closed. Other outdoor entertainment and sites, like professional sports, botanical gardens and zoos, can reopen with reduced capacity. Film and television production has also been given the go-ahead. It is unclear when indoor-only facilities will be allowed to reopen. The city and state are also still working on a plan to restart schools. Also on Monday, New York's Governor Andrew Cuomo will visit the southern state of Georgia, one of the states seeing a recent rise in Covid-19. Cuomo said he will meet with officials in Savannah, Georgia, to offer guidance and help with testing and tracing programmes as well as to deliver personal protective equipment. Cuomo said that health workers from across the country offered help to New York when his state was in the thick of it, and promised to repay the generosity.

Chris MasonPolitical Correspondent Coaches descend on Westminster Dozens of coaches have spent the afternoon making themselves heard in Westminster. They've been driving round in circles in Parliament Square blasting their horns - the industry says they have been forgotten by the government during the pandemic. I asked the Department for Transport for its reaction earlier this afternoon. A spokesman said the government has rovided a generous and wide-ranging package of support for businesses. ""Our job retention scheme has helped a million employers and protected more
than nine million jobs across the U.K. We have extended it until October â
meaning it will have been open for eight months and will continue to
support businesses as the economy reopens and people return to work,"" they said. They also highlighted other support measures like bounce back
loans, tax deferrals, business rates holidays and more than Â£10 billion of
grants. âLast week the Chancellor announced the second part of our support
for the economy through his Plan for Jobs, giving businesses the confidence to
retain and hire, and providing people with the tools they need to get better
jobs, including supporting jobs with a Â£1,000 Coronavirus Job Retention Bonus
for employers.â The coach industry wants help that is specifically tailored to them. Today's demonstration will no doubt not be the last - loads of industries are hurting and hurting badly, in a recession without precedent in modern times. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst An anti-mask protest that took place in Londonâs Hyde Park over the weekend is being widely mocked in China today, a country wheremandatory mask wearing because of Covid-19 has been part and parcel since the beginning of the year. Thousands have taken to Chinaâs Facebook-equivalent Sina Weibo, mocking resistance in England towards masks as a perceived restriction of freedom, even though wearing one will become mandatory in shops and supermarkets from 24 July. It comes at a time when relations between China and the UK are especially strained, withthe UK terminating its agreement with Chinese tech giant Huawei for 5G infrastructure last week, andthe UK government changing its extradition arrangements with Hong Kong. âLet them watch the âfreedomâ they value collapse,â one Weibo user says, and many speculate resistance could lead to a second wave in the country. Others joke the English are being brainwashed by conspiracy theories. âNo masks, no 5G, no vaccines = no lives,â one says. Some call the activists âapprentices of [US President] Trumpâ.

But here's a quick recap of some of the main stories:  The UK economyhas ""clawed back"" about half the fall in output it saw during the peak of the coronavirus lockdownin March and April, according to the Bank of England's chief economist. Andy Haldane told MPs there had been a ""V"" shaped ""bounceback"". Last month, Mr Haldane said the economy was ""on track for a quick recovery"" - the so-called ""V"" shape. However, other economists have expressed doubts about the potential for such a swift recovery in activity. ""Roughly half of the roughly 25% fall in activity during March and April has been clawed back over the period since,"" Mr Haldane told members of the Treasury Select Committee. The economy had grown by about 1% per week, he said. ""We have seen a bounceback. So far, it has been a 'V'. That of course doesn't tell us about where we might go next,"" he added. As cases surge in a number of US states, more than a dozen National Football League (NFL) players have taken to social media to demand clarification of Covid-19 policies to keep players and their families safe. Stars including Seattle Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson and Houston Texans player JJ Watt used the Twitter hashtag #WeWantToPlay to question the NFL's safety plan as players are told to report for training camps across the country. Wilson tweeted on Sunday: ""My wife is pregnant. NFL training camp is about to start.. And there's still No Clear Plan on Player Health & Family Safety."" Infectious disease experts have put together response plans for the league's 32 teams, according to USA Today Sports. Protocols negotiated by the league and players' association include mask requirements, hand sanitising and minimising shared equipment. But players say they still have not been told how the league will handle a positive Covid-19 test among teammates, whether they can opt-out of high-risk situations, or if there will be access to daily testing, among other concerns. At least 72 NFL players have tested positive for the virus thus far, according to the players' association. So far, the NFL plans for teams to begin training camps for the next few weeks before the season begins in September. Teams will travel as they normally did, but there will be limits on the number of fans in the stadiums. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

In Texas - one of America's virus hotspots, with over 335,000 cases - the state attorney general has said that religious schools are exempt from local health restrictions. On Friday, Attorney General Ken Paxton wrote in an open letter that it would be unconstitutional to require religious schools to close under any government orders. He cited the First Amendment, which protects religious freedoms, as well as the Texas governor's, which prohibits local governments ""from closing religious institutions or dictating mitigation strategies to those institutions"". ""Religious private schools
may continue to determine when it is safe for their communities to resume in-person
instruction free from any government mandate or interference,"" Paxton said. ""Religious private
schools therefore need not comply with local public health orders to the contrary."" The guidance comes as schools across the US's second most populous state are trying to determine how to reopen amid a Covid-19 surge, with many educators saying they are afraid to resume in-person classes. Days after the attorney general's letter, and after five consecutive days of more than 10,000 new Covid-19 cases, Texas Governor Greg Abbott said US Navy medical teams have been deployed in the state to assist with battling the virus. This video can not be played Why Texas is seeing a surge in coronavirus cases Will GrantBBC News, Havana The Cuban health ministry has announced there has been no local transmission of coronavirus on the island for the first time in more than four months. There was just one case of Covid-19 registered in the past 24-hours - however, the government said the patient had travelled into Cuba from abroad. The Cuban government has been praised by the Pan American Health Organization for its robust response to the pandemic. Face masks are mandatory in most settings and the island is only very cautiously reopening under a gradual three-phased approach. Havana is currently in phase one with many economic and social activities suspended. Inter-province travel can begin again under phase two and children will only return to classes once phase three has been declared. People in Southwold say its summer visitors are returning As the UK went into lockdown, the seaside town of Southwold was pleading with visitors to stay away from its pier, golden sands and promenade lined with candy-coloured beach huts. Banners around town said that trips to the seaside or to second homes were not essential travel. ""Please respect us - don't infect us,"" they said. Nowthey're trying to encourage visitors back. At ice cream shop Beaches and Cream, Lynda Walker said the banners could not have been made by a business owner. ""We want to see holidaymakers - they're our bread and butter and we are glad they are back."" Some said the town already has ""that busy summer feeling"" but others like market stallholder Darren Crane worry that ""we haven't got many weeks left to make the money to get through the winter."" Meanwhile, officials in Wales say beauty spots are experiencing the opposite problem â they'reso overrun by visitors enjoying their restored freedom that the crowds of parked cars are ""putting lives at risk"". While outdoor dining has been allowed, indoor dining remains prohibited in New  York City New York City, once the epicentre of the pandemic in the US, is now entering the last phase of reopening - albeit with some modifications. It's the last region of the state to do so. Mayor Bill de Blasio said indoor dining and drinking would still not be allowed to resume and indoor venues like museums would remain closed. Other outdoor entertainment and sites, like professional sports, botanical gardens and zoos, can reopen with reduced capacity. Film and television production has also been given the go-ahead. It is unclear when indoor-only facilities will be allowed to reopen. The city and state are also still working on a plan to restart schools. Also on Monday, New York's Governor Andrew Cuomo will visit the southern state of Georgia, one of the states seeing a recent rise in Covid-19. Cuomo said he will meet with officials in Savannah, Georgia, to offer guidance and help with testing and tracing programmes as well as to deliver personal protective equipment. Cuomo said that health workers from across the country offered help to New York when his state was in the thick of it, and promised to repay the generosity. ""Whatever they need from us theyâre going to get.""

Chris MasonPolitical Correspondent Coaches descend on Westminster Dozens of coaches have spent the afternoon making themselves heard in Westminster. They've been driving round in circles in Parliament Square blasting their horns - the industry says they have been forgotten by the government during the pandemic. I asked the Department for Transport for its reaction earlier this afternoon. A spokesman said the government has rovided a generous and wide-ranging package of support for businesses. ""Our job retention scheme has helped a million employers and protected more
than nine million jobs across the U.K. We have extended it until October â
meaning it will have been open for eight months and will continue to
support businesses as the economy reopens and people return to work,"" they said. They also highlighted other support measures like bounce back
loans, tax deferrals, business rates holidays and more than Â£10 billion of
grants. âLast week the Chancellor announced the second part of our support
for the economy through his Plan for Jobs, giving businesses the confidence to
retain and hire, and providing people with the tools they need to get better
jobs, including supporting jobs with a Â£1,000 Coronavirus Job Retention Bonus
for employers.â The coach industry wants help that is specifically tailored to them. Today's demonstration will no doubt not be the last - loads of industries are hurting and hurting badly, in a recession without precedent in modern times. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst An anti-mask protest that took place in Londonâs Hyde Park over the weekend is being widely mocked in China today, a country wheremandatory mask wearing because of Covid-19 has been part and parcel since the beginning of the year. Thousands have taken to Chinaâs Facebook-equivalent Sina Weibo, mocking resistance in England towards masks as a perceived restriction of freedom, even though wearing one will become mandatory in shops and supermarkets from 24 July. It comes at a time when relations between China and the UK are especially strained, withthe UK terminating its agreement with Chinese tech giant Huawei for 5G infrastructure last week, andthe UK government changing its extradition arrangements with Hong Kong. âLet them watch the âfreedomâ they value collapse,â one Weibo user says, and many speculate resistance could lead to a second wave in the country. Others joke the English are being brainwashed by conspiracy theories. âNo masks, no 5G, no vaccines = no lives,â one says. Some call the activists âapprentices of [US President] Trumpâ. You can read more about the different attitudes countries have to masks here. Outspoken Zimbabwean journalist Hopewell Chinâono has been arrested by police, human rights lawyer Beatrice Mtetwa has confirmed. He filmed his arrest before being told to put his phone down. Chinâono recently exposed an alleged Covid-19 procurement fraud within the health ministry. The story led to the arrest and sacking of Health Minister Obadiah Moyo President Emmerson Mnangagwa fired Mr Moyo earlier this month for âinappropriate conductâ over the $60m (Â£47.5m) medicines supply scandal. Mark SavageMusic reporter, BBC News Q Magazine, a cornerstone of rock journalism in the UK, is to close after 34 years. ""The pandemic did for us and there was nothing more to it than that,""said the editor Ted Kessler in a tweet.,externalHe also shared the editor's letter for the final issue, due on 28 July, in which he said: ""I must apologise for my failure to keep Q afloat."" The magazine's circulation had fallen to 28,000 per month from a peak of 200,000 in 2001. Founded in 1986 by Mark Ellen and David Hepworth, Q arrived at the same time as the CD revolution took off - and its glossy, aspirational format chimed perfectly with the times. Its hefty and comprehensive reviews section not only covered new releases, but the copious re-issues that were starting to appear as record labels plundered their archives to bolster the new format.

WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus The World Health Organization (WHO) has welcomed today's progress towards a vaccine but says work still needs to be done to combat the spread of Covid-19. At a briefing in Geneva, Dr Mike Ryan, director of the WHO emergencies programme, congratulated the scientists behindthe Oxford vaccine, saying: ""This is a positive result but again there is a long way to go."" He added that now, ""real world"" trials must be done on a larger scale. There are 23 potential vaccines in development thus far. ""But it is good to see more data and more products moving into this very important phase of vaccine discovery."" WHO chief Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus also emphasised that any successful vaccines must be accessible to all. He said many countries are seeing the advantages of making the vaccine ""a global public good"", but some are ""going the reverse direction"". ""When there is no consensus, it could be actually owned by those who have money and those who cannot afford it may not have access to the vaccines."" The director-general also said that while vaccine research continues, ""we have to save lives now"". ""We must continue to accelerate vaccine research while doing more with the tools we have at hand."" US President Donald Trump has said that, from tomorrow he will resume regular public briefings about his administration's response to America's coronavirus outbreak. Mr Trump gave 35 daily briefings with the White House's coronavirus task force in March and April, but frequently came under criticism for providing false or misleading statements. In turn, he accused the media of bias. He said the revival of briefings would allow him to share ""positive things"" his administration is doing, and updates on vaccines and treatments. ""I think itâs a great way to get information out to the public,"" the president told reporters. ""We had a lot of people watching, record numbers watching in the history of cable television, and thereâs never been anything like it."" His first briefing is scheduled for Tuesday at 17:00 local time (21:00 GMT). A further 11 deaths have been recorded in the UK, bringing the total number of people who died in hospital, care homes and the community after a positive coronavirus test to 45,312. According tocoronavirus.data.gov.uk,external, there were also 580 new positive tests in the last 24 hours, continuing a trend in recent days when the fall in cases appears to have levelled out. It comes after the Department of Health has ordered a review into the UK-wide daily death statistics, after concerns that figures contributed by England may include deaths which occur months after a positive test. Other UK nations have a 28-day cut-off point. But Public Health England is continuing to make the figures available on the coronavirus data dashboard. It says that about 4,000 of the 45,000 deaths occurred after more than 28 days, and only 2,000 of those were not attributed by the recording doctor to Covid-19. Miami Beach has enacted a curfew amid rising cases Florida has reported its fifth consecutive day of more than 10,000 new Covid-19 cases. On Sunday, an additional 12,478 people tested positive for coronavirus, according to the state health agency. The total number of cases since March in the Sunshine State is now more than 350,000. The death toll is nearing 5,000, and hospitals across the state say bed space is filling up. As officials try to contain the surge, some parts of South Florida have enacted curfews. On Saturday, Miami Beach set a curfew of 20:00 to 05:00. On Friday, Broward County ordered a curfew from 23:00 to 05:00, in place until 1 August. Congresswoman Donna Shalala, a Democrat representing part of Miami-Dade county,told ABC News,external: ""The residents here are terrified and Iâm terrified, for the first time in my career, because thereâs a lack of leadership."" About 23% of the total number of cases were reported in just the last week,the Tampa Bay Times reports,external. In an interview aired on Sunday, US President Donald Trump told Fox News: ""We have embers and we do have flames. Florida became more flame-like, but itâs - itâs going to be under control."" More on Florida: BBC OS Lydia Guthrie said she doesn't feel ""brave or selfless"" taking part in the trial One of those who volunteered to take part in the Oxford University vaccine trial is Lydia Guthrie. She was injected on April 30th with either the experimental Covid-19 vaccine or a placebo vaccine that protects against meningitis. Lydia says she developed flu-like symptoms after having her vaccine, but was warned by the research team that this might happen. Despite the small risk that was involved, she toldBBC OS on World Service radiothat she doesnât feel âbrave or selflessâ. âItâs not that brave because I trust the people involved. Itâs also not selfless because if we find a vaccine, I will benefit just as much as anybody else,"" said Lydia. âIf we get a vaccine Iâll be able to hug my mum again, and thatâs really worth it for me.â James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News These results from the Oxford vaccine trial are exciting, but
this is only the first hurdle. It is still not a vaccine we can say âworksâ. It is great news the vaccine can induce an immune response, including both antibodies that attack the virus and
T-cells, which hunt out and kill cells infected by the virus. But we do not know what level of
immune response is needed to protect people from coronavirus. That is why
further research is still needed. The answers at the moment are
unlikely to come from the UK as there is not enough coronavirus doing the
rounds to prove whether the vaccine is making a difference. The Oxford team already has
trials under way in South Africa and Brazil and there are plans for one in the
US too. However, it may yet require
âchallenge trialsâ in which people are vaccinated and deliberately infected
with the virus to see how effective it is. Read more here. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Negative,6.494587e-05
"Kaye Flitney is one of those enrolled on the clinical trial The preliminary results of a clinical trial suggest a new treatment for Covid-19 reduces the number of patients needing intensive care, according to the UK company that developed it. The treatment from Southampton-based biotech Synairgen uses a protein called interferon beta which the body produces when it gets a viral infection. The protein is inhaled directly into the lungs of patients with coronavirus, using a nebuliser, in the hope that it will stimulate an immune response. The initial findings suggest the treatment cut the odds of a Covid-19 patient in hospital developing severe disease - such as requiring ventilation - by 79%. Patients were two to three times more likely to recover to the point where everyday activities were not compromised by their illness, Synairgen claims. It said the trial also indicated ""very significant"" reductions in breathlessness among patients who received the treatment. In addition, the average time patients spent in hospital is said to have been reduced by a third, for those receiving the new drug - down from an average of nine days to six days. UK hospital trials new coronavirus treatment drug Life-saving coronavirus drug 'major breakthrough' Coronavirus anti-viral drug 'biggest step forward' How near are we to curing coronavirus? The double-blind trial involved 101 volunteers who had been admitted for treatment at nine UK hospitals for Covid-19 infections. Half of the participants were given the drug, the other half got what is known as a placebo - an inactive substance. Stock market rules mean Synairgen is obliged to report the preliminary results of the trial. The results have not been published in a peer-reviewed journal, nor has the full data been made available; so the BBC cannot confirm the claims made for the treatment. This video can not be played Professor Tom Wilkinson: ""These are all encouraging signals... that the drug is having an important clinical effect"" But if the results are as the company says, it will be a very important step forward in the treatment of coronavirus infections. The scientist in charge of the trial, Tom Wilkinson, says if the results are confirmed in larger studies the new treatment will be ""a game changer"". The trial was relatively small but the signal that the treatment benefits patients was unusually strong, he says. ""We couldn't have expected much better results than these,"" Synairgen chief executive Richard Marsden told the BBC. He described the results as ""a major breakthrough in the treatment of hospitalised Covid-19 patients"". The BBC's Justin Rowlatt with nurse Sandy Aitken at a patient's bedside Mr Marsden said the company will be presenting its findings to medical regulators around the world in the next couple of days to see what further information they require in order to approve the treatment. That process could take months, although the British government, like many others, has said it will work as fast as possible to get promising coronavirus treatments approved. It is possible it could be given emergency approval,as the anti-viral drug remdesivir was in May. Another possibility is that permission will be given for more patients to receive the treatment with the effects being carefully monitored to confirm it is safe and effective. If it does get approval, the drug and the nebulisers used to deliver it would then need to be manufactured in large quantities. Mr Marsden says he instructed companies to start producing supplies back in April to ensure they would be available should the results be positive. He says he expects Synairgen to be able to deliver ""a few 100,000"" doses a month by the winter. Interferon beta is part of the body's first line of defence against viruses, warning it to expect a viral attack. The coronavirus seems to suppress its production as part of its strategy to evade our immune systems. This video can not be played Synairgen CEO Richard Marsden explains how the treatment uses the protein interferon beta to help fight the virus The new drug is a special formulation of interferon beta delivered directly to the airways via a nebuliser which makes the protein into an aerosol. The idea is that a direct dose of the protein in the lungs will trigger a stronger anti-viral response, even in patients whose immune systems are already weak. Interferon beta is commonly used in the treatment of multiple sclerosis. Previous clinical trials conducted by Synairgen have shown that it can stimulate an immune response and that patients with asthma and other chronic lung conditions can comfortably tolerate the treatment. No-one involved in the trial knew which patients have been given which treatment until it was over. ""If you know it's a drug, your mind might have a bias,"" explained Sandy Aitken, one of the nurses who administered the new drug to patients at Southampton Hospital. Synairgen's drug trial was the template for the Accord programme, a fast-track clinical trial scheme set up by the UK government in April to accelerate the development of new drugs for patients with Covid-19. The Synairgen team believes the drug could be even more effective at the early stages of infection. A trial exploring the effects of giving patients who are in high-risk groups the new drug as soon as they are confirmed as having Covid-19 has struggled to find volunteers because there are so few new infections at the moment. Expert in emergency medicine Prof Steve Goodacre, from the University of Sheffield, said: ""These results are not interpretable. We need the full details and, perhaps more importantly, the trial protocol. The trial should have been registered and a protocol made available before any analysis was undertaken."" Prof Naveed Sattar, professor of metabolic medicine at the University of Glasgow, said: ""The results seem very impressive, and although accepted that the trial is small with just over 100 participants, a 79% reduction in disease severity could be a game changer. ""It would be good to see the full results once presented and peer-reviewed to make sure they are robust and the trial conduct was rigorous. Also, with small numbers comes less certainty on the true level of benefit, or whether benefits vary between people with differing risk characteristics. Such work would require a larger trial but, even so, these results are very exciting."" SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now?

"Nigel Manton from Cheshire says he spent Â£10,000 on business interruption insurance for nothing ""It's a bit galling to realise... we've spent more than Â£10,000 on insurance which wasn't valid,"" says Nigel Manton, of the Fresh Skin Clinic, in Cheshire. His firm is one of hundreds that say they were wrongly denied cover for the virus and could go bust as a result. A court case to decide whether many businesses receive insurance payouts for damage caused to them by the pandemic begins on Monday. However, insurers say most business policies simply do not cover pandemics. A judge will decide on the correct interpretation of 17 so-called business interruption policies, but the ruling could affect up to 370,000 firms. ""All businesses thought they'd inoculated themselves by buying this insurance and they have found that this financial vaccine doesn't work,"" says Mr Manton. Following the lockdown, a host of businesses had to close their doors and many looked to insurers to cover their losses through their business interruption policies. Insurance firms ordered to pay out or explain However, many insurers disputed these claims, arguing that such policies were never intended for losses caused by unprecedented measures such as government-imposed lockdowns. About 400 companies have complained to the financial ombudsman, prompting City regulator the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) to bring this case. It has selected 17 examples from business interruption insurance policies used by 16 insurers, eight of whom were asked to take part in the court case. These include Hiscox, RSA Group, Arch Insurance, Argenta, Ecclesiastical, MS Amlin, QBE and Zurich, all of whom agreed to take part voluntarily. The FCA says the case will provide ""clarity and certainty for everyone involved in these business interruption disputes, policyholder and insurer alike"". The views of Mr Manton are echoed by the many businesses who've contacted the BBC over the past few months to express frustration that their business interruption insurance wouldn't pay out. After all, their business was indeed interrupted by the coronavirus pandemic, as the lockdown stopped them from using their premises, for example. Now many are crossing their fingers that the results of this case will mean their policies could pay out in future as many are - in the words of the FCA - ""under intense financial strain"". Simon Ager fears he could incur Â£200,000 of losses due to lockdown Simon Ager told the BBC his climbing company was at risk of being bankrupted because his insurer Hiscox was refusing to cover losses. According to his policy, the insurer should cover financial losses for any business unable to use their premises following ""an occurrence of any human infectious or human contagious disease, an outbreak of which must be notified to the local authority"". However, citing a separate clause, Hiscox argues that the policy was intended to cover incidents that occur only within a mile of a business Mr Ager is now part of the Hiscox Action Group, 369 of whose members are owed Â£47m in uncovered losses. They will give evidence in this week's case and have begun a separate arbitration claim against the insurer. Richard Leedham, a senior partner at law firm Mishcon de Reya, which represents the group, said: ""We can shed additional light on the matter and explain exactly why these policies should pay out and show the damage this refusal is doing to hundreds if not thousands of British businesses."" The Association of British Insurers says most business policies do not cover pandemics, as the level of risk involved would make premiums unaffordable. Instead the majority focus on property damage. Huw Evans, director general of the ABI, told the BBC: ""This is not a debate about whether these policies were intended to cover pandemics, it is a debate as to whether the wordings of these policies inadvertently cover pandemics. ""It is an argument about whether the wording allows insurers to decline the claim."" In June, Hiscox said it recognised businesses faced ""extremely difficult times"" and was committed to ""seeking expedited resolution of any contract dispute"". RSA Group said it continued to ""treat claims in line with legal advice, precedent and case law"". The FCA has said the 17 policies under review in the case are only a ""representative sample"" and that the test case would provide guidance for the interpretation of""many other"" business interruption policies.,external However, it has also said all along that most small business insurance policies will only focus on property damage and only have basic cover for business interruption. As such, it believes ""in the majority of cases, insurers are not obliged to pay out in relation to the coronavirus pandemic"" and this court case will only focus on the ""remainder of policies that could be argued to include cover"". The trial is expected to take eight days. âMy business could go bust if insurers donât payâ Insurance firms ordered to pay out or explain 'Like an atomic bomb': Los Angeles fire chiefs warn death toll is likely to rise What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

"UK High Street stalwart Marks and Spencer is to cut hundreds of jobs as coronavirus continues to hit trading. The retailer said 950 store management and head office jobs were at risk because it needed to accelerate its restructuring. A spokesperson said the move marked ""an important step"" in it becoming a ""stronger, leaner"" business. M&S was already undergoing a transformation that included cutting costs and closing some stores. The firm said that because of the pandemic, those measures would be accelerated under a programme called Never The Same Again. M&S said it now wanted to ""make three years' progress in one"". Retail sales jump in June - 'but crisis not over' John Lewis and Boots to cut 5,300 jobs M&S said it had started collective consultation with employee representatives and had set out plans to offer voluntary redundancy first to affected staff. Sacha Berendji, director of retail, operations and property at M&S, said: ""Through the crisis, we have seen how we can work faster and more flexibly by empowering store teams and it's essential that we embed that way of working. ""Our priority now is to support all those affected through the consultation process and beyond."" M&S's food stores were open throughout the coronavirus lockdown, but trading in other parts of the business was severely affected. Clothing sales fell by 84% year-on-year at the lowest point, the firm said in May,warning that some customer habits had ""changed forever"". M&S was already struggling to adapt to the rise of online shopping and changing customer tastes. The company had been facing increasing competition from fashion giants such as Primark on the High Street and Asos on the internet. It is also one of the few big food retailers without its own internet-based delivery service. However, the retailer's partnership with Ocado starts in September, replacing the online grocer's existing deal with Waitrose. In May, M&S chief executive Steve Rowe said that the impact of the virus lockdown had driven ""effects and aftershocks"" in the retail sector that would ""endure for the coming year and beyond"". Its latest announcement comes after a wave of redundancies on the High Street, with John Lewis, Boots and Debenhams among retailers announcing huge job cuts. Other lay-offs announced during the pandemic have included: Up to 5,000 job cutsat Upper Crust owner SSP Group Up to 700 jobs at Harrods About 600 workersat shirtmaker TM Lewin 1,900 jobs at CafÃ© Rouge-owner Casual Dining Group 1,000 jobsat Pret A Manger 1,700 UK jobsat plane-maker Airbus 1,300 crew and 727 pilotsat EasyJet 550 jobsare going at Daily Mirror publisher Reach On Monday, Ted Baker confirmed it could cut about a quarter of its UK workforce after the coronavirus pandemic added to its financial difficulties. The fashion retailer did not confirm the number of redundancies, but there are reports that 500 store and head office jobs will go. ""We have not taken this decision lightly and would like to thank all our colleagues for their hard work,"" a spokesperson said. The move is intended to save about Â£6m by the end of the year. Both part-time and full-time roles will be affected.

"Kaye Flitney is one of those enrolled on the clinical trial The preliminary results of a clinical trial suggest a new treatment for Covid-19 reduces the number of patients needing intensive care, according to the UK company that developed it. The treatment from Southampton-based biotech Synairgen uses a protein called interferon beta which the body produces when it gets a viral infection. The protein is inhaled directly into the lungs of patients with coronavirus, using a nebuliser, in the hope that it will stimulate an immune response. The initial findings suggest the treatment cut the odds of a Covid-19 patient in hospital developing severe disease - such as requiring ventilation - by 79%. Patients were two to three times more likely to recover to the point where everyday activities were not compromised by their illness, Synairgen claims. It said the trial also indicated ""very significant"" reductions in breathlessness among patients who received the treatment. In addition, the average time patients spent in hospital is said to have been reduced by a third, for those receiving the new drug - down from an average of nine days to six days. UK hospital trials new coronavirus treatment drug Life-saving coronavirus drug 'major breakthrough' Coronavirus anti-viral drug 'biggest step forward' How near are we to curing coronavirus? The double-blind trial involved 101 volunteers who had been admitted for treatment at nine UK hospitals for Covid-19 infections. Half of the participants were given the drug, the other half got what is known as a placebo - an inactive substance. Stock market rules mean Synairgen is obliged to report the preliminary results of the trial. The results have not been published in a peer-reviewed journal, nor has the full data been made available; so the BBC cannot confirm the claims made for the treatment. This video can not be played Professor Tom Wilkinson: ""These are all encouraging signals... that the drug is having an important clinical effect"" But if the results are as the company says, it will be a very important step forward in the treatment of coronavirus infections. The scientist in charge of the trial, Tom Wilkinson, says if the results are confirmed in larger studies the new treatment will be ""a game changer"". The trial was relatively small but the signal that the treatment benefits patients was unusually strong, he says. ""We couldn't have expected much better results than these,"" Synairgen chief executive Richard Marsden told the BBC. He described the results as ""a major breakthrough in the treatment of hospitalised Covid-19 patients"". The BBC's Justin Rowlatt with nurse Sandy Aitken at a patient's bedside Mr Marsden said the company will be presenting its findings to medical regulators around the world in the next couple of days to see what further information they require in order to approve the treatment. That process could take months, although the British government, like many others, has said it will work as fast as possible to get promising coronavirus treatments approved. It is possible it could be given emergency approval,as the anti-viral drug remdesivir was in May. Another possibility is that permission will be given for more patients to receive the treatment with the effects being carefully monitored to confirm it is safe and effective. If it does get approval, the drug and the nebulisers used to deliver it would then need to be manufactured in large quantities. Mr Marsden says he instructed companies to start producing supplies back in April to ensure they would be available should the results be positive. He says he expects Synairgen to be able to deliver ""a few 100,000"" doses a month by the winter. Interferon beta is part of the body's first line of defence against viruses, warning it to expect a viral attack. The coronavirus seems to suppress its production as part of its strategy to evade our immune systems. This video can not be played Synairgen CEO Richard Marsden explains how the treatment uses the protein interferon beta to help fight the virus The new drug is a special formulation of interferon beta delivered directly to the airways via a nebuliser which makes the protein into an aerosol. The idea is that a direct dose of the protein in the lungs will trigger a stronger anti-viral response, even in patients whose immune systems are already weak. Interferon beta is commonly used in the treatment of multiple sclerosis. Previous clinical trials conducted by Synairgen have shown that it can stimulate an immune response and that patients with asthma and other chronic lung conditions can comfortably tolerate the treatment. No-one involved in the trial knew which patients have been given which treatment until it was over. ""If you know it's a drug, your mind might have a bias,"" explained Sandy Aitken, one of the nurses who administered the new drug to patients at Southampton Hospital. Synairgen's drug trial was the template for the Accord programme, a fast-track clinical trial scheme set up by the UK government in April to accelerate the development of new drugs for patients with Covid-19. The Synairgen team believes the drug could be even more effective at the early stages of infection. A trial exploring the effects of giving patients who are in high-risk groups the new drug as soon as they are confirmed as having Covid-19 has struggled to find volunteers because there are so few new infections at the moment. Expert in emergency medicine Prof Steve Goodacre, from the University of Sheffield, said: ""These results are not interpretable. We need the full details and, perhaps more importantly, the trial protocol. The trial should have been registered and a protocol made available before any analysis was undertaken."" Prof Naveed Sattar, professor of metabolic medicine at the University of Glasgow, said: ""The results seem very impressive, and although accepted that the trial is small with just over 100 participants, a 79% reduction in disease severity could be a game changer. ""It would be good to see the full results once presented and peer-reviewed to make sure they are robust and the trial conduct was rigorous. Also, with small numbers comes less certainty on the true level of benefit, or whether benefits vary between people with differing risk characteristics. Such work would require a larger trial but, even so, these results are very exciting."" SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now?

"Thousands of fans attended the event, despite police appeals for mass gatherings to be avoided because of Covid-19 A huge clean-up operation has taken place after police officers were injured when thousands of Leeds United fans celebrated their club's promotion. One officer sustained a serious head injury during the event, attended by about 7,000 fans, after Leeds' Premier League promotion after 16 years. Bottles were thrown at officers and nine people were arrested for public order offences. Volunteers, including fans, joined council staff in cleaning up the area. Council staff were faced with mounds of rubbish in the city centre following Sunday's celebrations The clean-up operation took several hours to complete More news and stories from Yorkshire Sunday's city centre celebrations in Millennium Square came after fans had previously gathered on Friday and Saturday at the club's Elland Road ground. The club's promotion was confirmed on Friday, with the Championship title secured on Saturday after Brentford lost to Stoke. West Yorkshire Police said a female officer was being treated in hospital after sustaining a serious head injury. A number of other officers received minor injuries and 15 members of the public were also hurt, it added. This video can not be played Sunday saw 7,000 fans take to the city centre to celebrate Assistant Chief Constable Oz Khan said the force had continued to stress to fans the importance of Covid-19 precautions, appealing for large gatherings to be avoided and deploying officers to try to ensure the safety of those present. ""Almost 7,000 people gathered in Millennium Square in Leeds; whilst the vast majority of fans were enjoying themselves and celebrating, there were a small minority of people who began to throw bottles at police officers,"" he said. ""The safety of fans and the wider public is our primary concern. Violence towards police officers will not be tolerated and we deployed an appropriate police response to ensure that the festivities concluded safely."" Fans had been urged to stay at home if Leeds secured promotion The club's owner Andrea Radrizzani had urged fans to stay at home if Leeds secured promotion. He said he shared their desire to celebrate the club's success but did not believe what he had seen over the last 24 hours was responsible. ""Everybody wishes to get together and celebrate and we would love to open the stadium soon,"" he said. ""If we are not following the rules, if we take these superficially, then this might cause more cases, more problems and then we will have to postpone what we want which is to be back home at Elland Road as soon as possible."" Council staff were joined by volunteers, many of them fans, to clean up the area. This video can not be played Some fans helped council workers clean up the litter left at Millennium Square Volunteer Nick Moss, who did not attend the event on Sunday, said he was not surprised so many people decided to celebrate. ""Everybody's been in lockdown, there's a lot of emotion, it was like a big release for Leeds to get promoted,"" he said.

"Beefeaters and other iconic uniformed staff are facing job cuts at the Tower of London Beefeaters guarding the Tower of London face ""heartbreaking"" redundancies to cut costs following a drop in visitors. The pandemic forced the closure of six sites run by Historic Royal Palaces (HRP), and ""dealt a devastating blow"" to its finances, bosses said. The Tower attracted nearly three million visitors in 2018, making it the UK's most popular paid for attraction. HRP confirmed a voluntary redundancy scheme was in place and compulsory redundancies were likely to follow. The organisation believes it is the first time the guards have faced redundancy since the unit was formed by Henry VII in 1485. John Barnes, HRP's chief executive, said: ""Historic Royal Palaces is a self-funded charity. We depend on visitors for 80% of our income. ""We are heartbroken it has come to this. ""We have taken every possible measure to secure our financial position, but we need to do more to survive in the long term. ""We simply have no choice but to reduce our payroll costs."" Six sites run by Historic Royal Palaces temporarily closed due to the pandemic The temporary closure to visitors has created a Â£98m shortfall this year, HRP said. This is made up of current losses, the high maintenance costs of heating and providing electricity to large properties, and an expected slow recovery in tourism. Last year it cost HRP Â£32m to run its six sites, which include Hampton Court Palace and Kensington Palace. At least two of the 37 Yeoman Warders, nicknamed Beefeaters, who guard the Crown Jewels, have reportedly taken voluntary redundancy already. The site reopened on 10 July but only welcomes fewer than 1,000 people each day due to new safety measures - a huge drop from the 12,000 who would visit on a normal day. Jobs at Hampton Court Palace are also at risk The head of the Public and Commercial Services Union, which represents many workers at HRP sites, said the decision to cut jobs ""is a disgrace"". General secretary Mark Serwotka said: ""Our members help guard the Crown Jewels and keep historic royal monuments and premises clean and safe. ""They should not be paying for the effects of the coronavirus pandemic."" A spokesman for the prime minister said: ""We recognise the important role which the Beefeater guards play in the UK's rich cultural history. ""We are providing unprecedented financial assistance, which many heritage organisations including the Historic Royal Palaces have taken advantage of."" On lockdown with Tower of London's Beefeaters.

"Mrs Merkel (left) and Mr Macron (second left) say there has been some progress EU talks aimed at reaching an agreement on a huge post-coronavirus recovery fund have stretched into a fourth day but there are signs of progress. Germany and France said a framework had now been sketched, during a summit in Brussels that has seen testy exchanges. The main division is between hard-hit nations like Italy and Spain, and EU members who want to lessen funding. So-called ""frugal"" nations want grants limited - and â¬390bn (Â£352bn; $445bn) appears the latest compromise figure. They had argued the proposed â¬750bn overall package was too large and should be mostly loans. The discussions - which were originally scheduled to end on Saturday - were to get under way again on Monday afternoon for what is now the longest EU summit since Nice 2000, when talks lasted five days. The confirmed number of coronavirus cases has reached 14.5 million globally,according to Johns Hopkins University.,external Member states are largely split between those hit hardest by the outbreak - and keen to revive their economies - and those more concerned about the costs of the recovery plan. Tempers have often been frayed. In the early hours of Monday, French President Emmanuel Macron reportedly banged his hand on the table and threatened to walk out. However, as he arrived for the afternoon session, he was more upbeat, saying: ""There were very tense moments, moments that will likely still be difficult but on this topic things have moved forward and we must now get into the details of the new proposal."" This video can not be played German Chancellor Angela Merkel bumps elbows with EU Council leader Charles Michel The proposal concerns the main area of dispute - the amount to be paid out in grants. At least one earlier proposal on the issue had been put forward during the summit. The self-proclaimed frugal four - Sweden, Denmark, Austria and the Netherlands - along with Finland, had opposed allowing â¬500bn to be offered in the form of grants to countries hardest-hit by Covid-19. Led by Dutch PM Mark Rutte, they had set â¬375bn as the limit, plus conditions including the right to block requests. The others, including Spain and Italy, were refusing to go below â¬400bn. Diplomats say the figure of â¬390bn could now be the compromise. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said: ""Yesterday night, after long negotiations, we found a way to find a possible agreement. That is a step forward and we are hopeful that we can reach an agreement."" This is the first face-to-face meeting between leaders since governments began imposing lockdowns in March in a bid to stop the spread of the virus. Italy was one of the earliest European countries to suffer an outbreak and has recorded 35,000 deaths - one of the highest tolls in the world. PM Giuseppe Conte, who earlier complained that Europe was ""under the blackmail of the 'frugals'"", said he was cautiously optimistic a deal would be reached. Even Mr Rutte said he was a ""bit more hopeful"". Big choices face EU leaders on Covid recovery cash Are Italians losing faith in the EU? On Sunday, Hungarian PM Viktor Orban had accused Mr Rutte of a personal vendetta and of trying to link financial help to political issues. Mr Orban, and his ally Poland, have threatened to veto the package if it adopts a policy of withholding funds from nations who do not meet certain democratic principles. European Council President Charles Michel, left, with Angela Merkel, Emmanuel Macron and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, right This is now the longest European summit since Nice 20 years ago, which went into day five when leaders agreed to expand the membership. This time around, money is at the heart of the negotiations and the issue of trust is the cause of the quarrelling. Tempers have flared, and there has been some name calling, too. Mostly at the Dutch leader, Mark Rutte. Bulgaria's leader Boyko Borissov accused Mr Rutte of ""acting like the policeman of Europe"". Hungary's Viktor Orban said, ""It's Dutch guy who's to blame... I don't know why he dislikes us."" French officials tell me President Macron ""banged his fists"" on the table , as he told the ""frugal four"" that he thought they were putting the European project in danger. An Italian diplomat said Prime Minister Conte told Mr Rutte: ""You might be a hero in your home country for a few days. But after a few weeks you will be held responsible for blocking an effective European response to Covid-19."" These negotiations may become known unofficially as the ""stiff-leg summit"" - a term being used by the Dutch here meaning that Mr Rutte has been sticking to his guns. There was a notable show of social-distancing etiquette when the leaders first arrived, faces covered by masks. But photos from Sunday evening show that the masks have slipped, along, it seems, with their approach to diplomacy.

"Sam Barnett at Aberdare Park with her daughter Playgrounds, outdoor gyms and funfairs are now able to reopen in Wales after being shut during the coronavirus lockdown. It is the latest round of measures to ease restrictions. Pubs, restaurants and cafes were able to resume trading outdoors from last Monday, and hairdressers were also able to reopen. From 27 July, cinemas, museums and galleries, beauty salons and tattoo parlours can also reopen.

"Video-sharing app TikTok has denied accusations that it is controlled by the Chinese government. Theo Bertram, TikTok's head of public policy for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, said it would refuse any request from China to hand over data. ""The suggestion that we are in any way under the thumb of the Chinese government is completely and utterly false,"" he told the BBC. TikTok has come under pressure by Washington over its future in the US. Its owner, ByteDance, which is based in Beijing but domiciled in the Cayman Islands, has had talks with the UK government about basing its HQ in London. But the US is considering banning TikTok and may only allow it to keep operating if it splits from China and becomes an American company. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo - who is visiting the UK this week - has alleged that TikTok users in the US are at risk of their data ending up ""in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party"". Mr Bertram told the BBC's Today programme that TikTok had not made any decisions about where to site its international headquarters, but added: ""We are committed to growing further in the UK."" He added that if TikTok were approached by the Chinese government, ""we would definitely say no to any request for data"". A spokeswoman for the Department for International Trade said: ""ByteDance's decision on the location of their global HQ is a commercial decision for the company."" This video can not be played Will TikTok be banned? Mr Bertram also denied allegations that TikTok was lenient towards paedophiles caught grooming children through its app. The Daily Telegraph said it had seen leaked documents,externalshowing that users found messaging children in a sexual way had to commit three offences before incurring a permanent ban.

The Sunday Times reported that a decision by TikTok to build its headquarters in the UK has the potential to create 3,000 jobs.

"West addressed the crowd without a microphone Kanye West has officially launched his campaign for the 2020 US presidential election, with an unorthodox rally in Charleston, South Carolina. West, 43, is running as a candidate for his self-styled ""Birthday Party"". At the event, the rapper seemed to make policy decisions off-the-cuff and made several rants, including on abortion and on abolitionist Harriet Tubman. Fans have questioned whether his last-minute bid for the White House is actually a promotional stunt. The Charleston rally did little to clarify whether his run is genuine. But a now-deleted tweet sent from West's account on Saturday, appearing to show the song list for a new album, added to the speculation. The event, held at a wedding and conference hall in the city, was said to be open to registered guests only - but West's campaign website had no function for people to register or RSVP. West appeared with ""2020"" shaved into the back of his head and wearing a protective security vest, and addressed the gathered crowd without a microphone. There were no audience microphones either, leading West to repeatedly tell the crowd to be silent so he could hear the questions being asked. This video can not be played Kanye West cried as he told the rally his father had wanted to abort him - and he ""almost killed"" his own daughter At one point he began crying when talking about abortion, saying that his parents almost aborted him: ""There would have been no Kanye West, because my dad was too busy."" He added: ""I almost killed my daughter... even if my wife [Kim Kardashian West] were to divorce me after this speech, she brought North into the world, even when I didn't want to."" Kanye West again says he will run for president Here's what President Kanye would do Kanye: 'I'm the greatest artist of all time' However he then added that he believes abortion should remain legal, but there should be financial support for struggling new mothers - suggesting that ""everybody that has a baby gets a million dollars"". ""The only thing that can free us is by obeying the rules that were given to us for a promised land,"" he said. ""Abortion should be legal because guess what? The law is not by God anyway, so what is legality?"" Kanye West became emotional when talking about his wife Kim Kardashian West and their children At another moment, he gave an impromptu monologue about 19th century abolitionist Harriet Tubman. ""Harriet Tubman never actually freed the slaves, she just had the slaves go work for other white people,"" he said. Tubman was born into slavery, but managed to escape a Maryland plantation in 1849, aged 27. She then returned to the South to rescue other slaves on the network of routes and safe houses known as ""underground railroad"", risking her own life to lead people to freedom. West also became tearful when talking about his late mother, who died in 2007 from complications during cosmetic surgery. The speech has been met with anger by some - mostly sparked by his comments about Tubman - but also with concern over West's welfare. Professor Jason Nichols, a senior lecturer in African American studies at the University of Maryland, told the BBC he feared West's rambling appearance pointed towards a ""manic episode"" - although he acknowledged he was not a psychologist. ""He has admitted in the past he has been battling mental illness and that sometimes he does not take medication. ""He was a little more coherent than he has been in other times... when he has gone on these rants, but I really believe he is in a bad place right now. He said some really bizarre things."" Professor Nichols added that he was disappointed, as he had hoped West would be able ""to push the other candidates"", had he had the right advice and support. ""I was actually interested to see what would happen, but after the event today, all that interest has just turned to worry."" West, who announced his candidacy on 4 July, has already missed the deadline to qualify for the ballot in several states. He needs to collect enough signatures to appear on the ballot in a number of others. Last week he qualified to appear on Oklahoma's presidential ballot, the first state where he met the requirements before the deadline. In order to appear on South Carolina's ballot he needs to collect 10,000 signatures by noon local time (18:00 BST) on Monday.

"Mrs Merkel (left) and Mr Macron (second left) say there has been some progress EU talks aimed at reaching an agreement on a huge post-coronavirus recovery fund have stretched into a fourth day but there are signs of progress. Germany and France said a framework had now been sketched, during a summit in Brussels that has seen testy exchanges. The main division is between hard-hit nations like Italy and Spain, and EU members who want to lessen funding. So-called ""frugal"" nations want grants limited - and â¬390bn (Â£352bn; $445bn) appears the latest compromise figure. They had argued the proposed â¬750bn overall package was too large and should be mostly loans. The discussions - which were originally scheduled to end on Saturday - were to get under way again on Monday afternoon for what is now the longest EU summit since Nice 2000, when talks lasted five days. The confirmed number of coronavirus cases has reached 14.5 million globally,according to Johns Hopkins University.,external Member states are largely split between those hit hardest by the outbreak - and keen to revive their economies - and those more concerned about the costs of the recovery plan. Tempers have often been frayed. In the early hours of Monday, French President Emmanuel Macron reportedly banged his hand on the table and threatened to walk out. However, as he arrived for the afternoon session, he was more upbeat, saying: ""There were very tense moments, moments that will likely still be difficult but on this topic things have moved forward and we must now get into the details of the new proposal."" This video can not be played German Chancellor Angela Merkel bumps elbows with EU Council leader Charles Michel The proposal concerns the main area of dispute - the amount to be paid out in grants. At least one earlier proposal on the issue had been put forward during the summit. The self-proclaimed frugal four - Sweden, Denmark, Austria and the Netherlands - along with Finland, had opposed allowing â¬500bn to be offered in the form of grants to countries hardest-hit by Covid-19. Led by Dutch PM Mark Rutte, they had set â¬375bn as the limit, plus conditions including the right to block requests. The others, including Spain and Italy, were refusing to go below â¬400bn. Diplomats say the figure of â¬390bn could now be the compromise. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said: ""Yesterday night, after long negotiations, we found a way to find a possible agreement. That is a step forward and we are hopeful that we can reach an agreement."" This is the first face-to-face meeting between leaders since governments began imposing lockdowns in March in a bid to stop the spread of the virus. Italy was one of the earliest European countries to suffer an outbreak and has recorded 35,000 deaths - one of the highest tolls in the world. PM Giuseppe Conte, who earlier complained that Europe was ""under the blackmail of the 'frugals'"", said he was cautiously optimistic a deal would be reached. Even Mr Rutte said he was a ""bit more hopeful"". Big choices face EU leaders on Covid recovery cash Are Italians losing faith in the EU? On Sunday, Hungarian PM Viktor Orban had accused Mr Rutte of a personal vendetta and of trying to link financial help to political issues. Mr Orban, and his ally Poland, have threatened to veto the package if it adopts a policy of withholding funds from nations who do not meet certain democratic principles. European Council President Charles Michel, left, with Angela Merkel, Emmanuel Macron and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, right This is now the longest European summit since Nice 20 years ago, which went into day five when leaders agreed to expand the membership. This time around, money is at the heart of the negotiations and the issue of trust is the cause of the quarrelling. Tempers have flared, and there has been some name calling, too. Mostly at the Dutch leader, Mark Rutte. Bulgaria's leader Boyko Borissov accused Mr Rutte of ""acting like the policeman of Europe"". Hungary's Viktor Orban said, ""It's Dutch guy who's to blame... I don't know why he dislikes us."" French officials tell me President Macron ""banged his fists"" on the table , as he told the ""frugal four"" that he thought they were putting the European project in danger. An Italian diplomat said Prime Minister Conte told Mr Rutte: ""You might be a hero in your home country for a few days. But after a few weeks you will be held responsible for blocking an effective European response to Covid-19."" These negotiations may become known unofficially as the ""stiff-leg summit"" - a term being used by the Dutch here meaning that Mr Rutte has been sticking to his guns. There was a notable show of social-distancing etiquette when the leaders first arrived, faces covered by masks. But photos from Sunday evening show that the masks have slipped, along, it seems, with their approach to diplomacy.

"Nigel Manton from Cheshire says he spent Â£10,000 on business interruption insurance for nothing ""It's a bit galling to realise... we've spent more than Â£10,000 on insurance which wasn't valid,"" says Nigel Manton, of the Fresh Skin Clinic, in Cheshire. His firm is one of hundreds that say they were wrongly denied cover for the virus and could go bust as a result. A court case to decide whether many businesses receive insurance payouts for damage caused to them by the pandemic begins on Monday. However, insurers say most business policies simply do not cover pandemics. A judge will decide on the correct interpretation of 17 so-called business interruption policies, but the ruling could affect up to 370,000 firms. ""All businesses thought they'd inoculated themselves by buying this insurance and they have found that this financial vaccine doesn't work,"" says Mr Manton. Following the lockdown, a host of businesses had to close their doors and many looked to insurers to cover their losses through their business interruption policies. Insurance firms ordered to pay out or explain However, many insurers disputed these claims, arguing that such policies were never intended for losses caused by unprecedented measures such as government-imposed lockdowns. About 400 companies have complained to the financial ombudsman, prompting City regulator the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) to bring this case. It has selected 17 examples from business interruption insurance policies used by 16 insurers, eight of whom were asked to take part in the court case. These include Hiscox, RSA Group, Arch Insurance, Argenta, Ecclesiastical, MS Amlin, QBE and Zurich, all of whom agreed to take part voluntarily. The FCA says the case will provide ""clarity and certainty for everyone involved in these business interruption disputes, policyholder and insurer alike"". The views of Mr Manton are echoed by the many businesses who've contacted the BBC over the past few months to express frustration that their business interruption insurance wouldn't pay out. After all, their business was indeed interrupted by the coronavirus pandemic, as the lockdown stopped them from using their premises, for example. Now many are crossing their fingers that the results of this case will mean their policies could pay out in future as many are - in the words of the FCA - ""under intense financial strain"". Simon Ager fears he could incur Â£200,000 of losses due to lockdown Simon Ager told the BBC his climbing company was at risk of being bankrupted because his insurer Hiscox was refusing to cover losses. According to his policy, the insurer should cover financial losses for any business unable to use their premises following ""an occurrence of any human infectious or human contagious disease, an outbreak of which must be notified to the local authority"". However, citing a separate clause, Hiscox argues that the policy was intended to cover incidents that occur only within a mile of a business Mr Ager is now part of the Hiscox Action Group, 369 of whose members are owed Â£47m in uncovered losses. They will give evidence in this week's case and have begun a separate arbitration claim against the insurer. Richard Leedham, a senior partner at law firm Mishcon de Reya, which represents the group, said: ""We can shed additional light on the matter and explain exactly why these policies should pay out and show the damage this refusal is doing to hundreds if not thousands of British businesses."" The Association of British Insurers says most business policies do not cover pandemics, as the level of risk involved would make premiums unaffordable. Instead the majority focus on property damage. Huw Evans, director general of the ABI, told the BBC: ""This is not a debate about whether these policies were intended to cover pandemics, it is a debate as to whether the wordings of these policies inadvertently cover pandemics. ""It is an argument about whether the wording allows insurers to decline the claim."" In June, Hiscox said it recognised businesses faced ""extremely difficult times"" and was committed to ""seeking expedited resolution of any contract dispute"". RSA Group said it continued to ""treat claims in line with legal advice, precedent and case law"". The FCA has said the 17 policies under review in the case are only a ""representative sample"" and that the test case would provide guidance for the interpretation of""many other"" business interruption policies.,external However, it has also said all along that most small business insurance policies will only focus on property damage and only have basic cover for business interruption. As such, it believes ""in the majority of cases, insurers are not obliged to pay out in relation to the coronavirus pandemic"" and this court case will only focus on the ""remainder of policies that could be argued to include cover"". The trial is expected to take eight days. âMy business could go bust if insurers donât payâ Insurance firms ordered to pay out or explain 'Like an atomic bomb': Los Angeles fire chiefs warn death toll is likely to rise What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

But here's a quick recap of some of the main stories:  The UK economyhas ""clawed back"" about half the fall in output it saw during the peak of the coronavirus lockdownin March and April, according to the Bank of England's chief economist. Andy Haldane told MPs there had been a ""V"" shaped ""bounceback"". Last month, Mr Haldane said the economy was ""on track for a quick recovery"" - the so-called ""V"" shape. However, other economists have expressed doubts about the potential for such a swift recovery in activity. ""Roughly half of the roughly 25% fall in activity during March and April has been clawed back over the period since,"" Mr Haldane told members of the Treasury Select Committee. The economy had grown by about 1% per week, he said. ""We have seen a bounceback. So far, it has been a 'V'. That of course doesn't tell us about where we might go next,"" he added. As cases surge in a number of US states, more than a dozen National Football League (NFL) players have taken to social media to demand clarification of Covid-19 policies to keep players and their families safe. Stars including Seattle Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson and Houston Texans player JJ Watt used the Twitter hashtag #WeWantToPlay to question the NFL's safety plan as players are told to report for training camps across the country. Wilson tweeted on Sunday: ""My wife is pregnant. NFL training camp is about to start.. And there's still No Clear Plan on Player Health & Family Safety."" Infectious disease experts have put together response plans for the league's 32 teams, according to USA Today Sports. Protocols negotiated by the league and players' association include mask requirements, hand sanitising and minimising shared equipment. But players say they still have not been told how the league will handle a positive Covid-19 test among teammates, whether they can opt-out of high-risk situations, or if there will be access to daily testing, among other concerns. At least 72 NFL players have tested positive for the virus thus far, according to the players' association. So far, the NFL plans for teams to begin training camps for the next few weeks before the season begins in September. Teams will travel as they normally did, but there will be limits on the number of fans in the stadiums. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

In Texas - one of America's virus hotspots, with over 335,000 cases - the state attorney general has said that religious schools are exempt from local health restrictions. On Friday, Attorney General Ken Paxton wrote in an open letter that it would be unconstitutional to require religious schools to close under any government orders. He cited the First Amendment, which protects religious freedoms, as well as the Texas governor's, which prohibits local governments ""from closing religious institutions or dictating mitigation strategies to those institutions"". ""Religious private schools
may continue to determine when it is safe for their communities to resume in-person
instruction free from any government mandate or interference,"" Paxton said. ""Religious private
schools therefore need not comply with local public health orders to the contrary."" The guidance comes as schools across the US's second most populous state are trying to determine how to reopen amid a Covid-19 surge, with many educators saying they are afraid to resume in-person classes. Days after the attorney general's letter, and after five consecutive days of more than 10,000 new Covid-19 cases, Texas Governor Greg Abbott said US Navy medical teams have been deployed in the state to assist with battling the virus. This video can not be played Why Texas is seeing a surge in coronavirus cases Will GrantBBC News, Havana The Cuban health ministry has announced there has been no local transmission of coronavirus on the island for the first time in more than four months. There was just one case of Covid-19 registered in the past 24-hours - however, the government said the patient had travelled into Cuba from abroad. The Cuban government has been praised by the Pan American Health Organization for its robust response to the pandemic. Face masks are mandatory in most settings and the island is only very cautiously reopening under a gradual three-phased approach. Havana is currently in phase one with many economic and social activities suspended. Inter-province travel can begin again under phase two and children will only return to classes once phase three has been declared. People in Southwold say its summer visitors are returning As the UK went into lockdown, the seaside town of Southwold was pleading with visitors to stay away from its pier, golden sands and promenade lined with candy-coloured beach huts. Banners around town said that trips to the seaside or to second homes were not essential travel. ""Please respect us - don't infect us,"" they said. Nowthey're trying to encourage visitors back. At ice cream shop Beaches and Cream, Lynda Walker said the banners could not have been made by a business owner. ""We want to see holidaymakers - they're our bread and butter and we are glad they are back."" Some said the town already has ""that busy summer feeling"" but others like market stallholder Darren Crane worry that ""we haven't got many weeks left to make the money to get through the winter."" Meanwhile, officials in Wales say beauty spots are experiencing the opposite problem â they'reso overrun by visitors enjoying their restored freedom that the crowds of parked cars are ""putting lives at risk"". While outdoor dining has been allowed, indoor dining remains prohibited in New  York City New York City, once the epicentre of the pandemic in the US, is now entering the last phase of reopening - albeit with some modifications. It's the last region of the state to do so. Mayor Bill de Blasio said indoor dining and drinking would still not be allowed to resume and indoor venues like museums would remain closed. Other outdoor entertainment and sites, like professional sports, botanical gardens and zoos, can reopen with reduced capacity. Film and television production has also been given the go-ahead. It is unclear when indoor-only facilities will be allowed to reopen. The city and state are also still working on a plan to restart schools. Also on Monday, New York's Governor Andrew Cuomo will visit the southern state of Georgia, one of the states seeing a recent rise in Covid-19. Cuomo said he will meet with officials in Savannah, Georgia, to offer guidance and help with testing and tracing programmes as well as to deliver personal protective equipment. Cuomo said that health workers from across the country offered help to New York when his state was in the thick of it, and promised to repay the generosity.

Chris MasonPolitical Correspondent Coaches descend on Westminster Dozens of coaches have spent the afternoon making themselves heard in Westminster. They've been driving round in circles in Parliament Square blasting their horns - the industry says they have been forgotten by the government during the pandemic. I asked the Department for Transport for its reaction earlier this afternoon. A spokesman said the government has rovided a generous and wide-ranging package of support for businesses. ""Our job retention scheme has helped a million employers and protected more
than nine million jobs across the U.K. We have extended it until October â
meaning it will have been open for eight months and will continue to
support businesses as the economy reopens and people return to work,"" they said. They also highlighted other support measures like bounce back
loans, tax deferrals, business rates holidays and more than Â£10 billion of
grants. âLast week the Chancellor announced the second part of our support
for the economy through his Plan for Jobs, giving businesses the confidence to
retain and hire, and providing people with the tools they need to get better
jobs, including supporting jobs with a Â£1,000 Coronavirus Job Retention Bonus
for employers.â The coach industry wants help that is specifically tailored to them. Today's demonstration will no doubt not be the last - loads of industries are hurting and hurting badly, in a recession without precedent in modern times. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst An anti-mask protest that took place in Londonâs Hyde Park over the weekend is being widely mocked in China today, a country wheremandatory mask wearing because of Covid-19 has been part and parcel since the beginning of the year. Thousands have taken to Chinaâs Facebook-equivalent Sina Weibo, mocking resistance in England towards masks as a perceived restriction of freedom, even though wearing one will become mandatory in shops and supermarkets from 24 July. It comes at a time when relations between China and the UK are especially strained, withthe UK terminating its agreement with Chinese tech giant Huawei for 5G infrastructure last week, andthe UK government changing its extradition arrangements with Hong Kong. âLet them watch the âfreedomâ they value collapse,â one Weibo user says, and many speculate resistance could lead to a second wave in the country. Others joke the English are being brainwashed by conspiracy theories. âNo masks, no 5G, no vaccines = no lives,â one says. Some call the activists âapprentices of [US President] Trumpâ.

Outspoken Zimbabwean journalist Hopewell Chinâono has been arrested by police, human rights lawyer Beatrice Mtetwa has confirmed. He filmed his arrest before being told to put his phone down.

Mark SavageMusic reporter, BBC News Q Magazine, a cornerstone of rock journalism in the UK, is to close after 34 years. ""The pandemic did for us and there was nothing more to it than that,""said the editor Ted Kessler in a tweet.,externalHe also shared the editor's letter for the final issue, due on 28 July, in which he said: ""I must apologise for my failure to keep Q afloat."" The magazine's circulation had fallen to 28,000 per month from a peak of 200,000 in 2001. Founded in 1986 by Mark Ellen and David Hepworth, Q arrived at the same time as the CD revolution took off - and its glossy, aspirational format chimed perfectly with the times.

WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus The World Health Organization (WHO) has welcomed today's progress towards a vaccine but says work still needs to be done to combat the spread of Covid-19. At a briefing in Geneva, Dr Mike Ryan, director of the WHO emergencies programme, congratulated the scientists behindthe Oxford vaccine, saying: ""This is a positive result but again there is a long way to go."" He added that now, ""real world"" trials must be done on a larger scale. There are 23 potential vaccines in development thus far. ""But it is good to see more data and more products moving into this very important phase of vaccine discovery."" WHO chief Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus also emphasised that any successful vaccines must be accessible to all. He said many countries are seeing the advantages of making the vaccine ""a global public good"", but some are ""going the reverse direction"". ""When there is no consensus, it could be actually owned by those who have money and those who cannot afford it may not have access to the vaccines."" The director-general also said that while vaccine research continues, ""we have to save lives now"". ""We must continue to accelerate vaccine research while doing more with the tools we have at hand."" US President Donald Trump has said that, from tomorrow he will resume regular public briefings about his administration's response to America's coronavirus outbreak. Mr Trump gave 35 daily briefings with the White House's coronavirus task force in March and April, but frequently came under criticism for providing false or misleading statements. In turn, he accused the media of bias. He said the revival of briefings would allow him to share ""positive things"" his administration is doing, and updates on vaccines and treatments. ""I think itâs a great way to get information out to the public,"" the president told reporters. ""We had a lot of people watching, record numbers watching in the history of cable television, and thereâs never been anything like it."" His first briefing is scheduled for Tuesday at 17:00 local time (21:00 GMT). A further 11 deaths have been recorded in the UK, bringing the total number of people who died in hospital, care homes and the community after a positive coronavirus test to 45,312. According tocoronavirus.data.gov.uk,external, there were also 580 new positive tests in the last 24 hours, continuing a trend in recent days when the fall in cases appears to have levelled out. It comes after the Department of Health has ordered a review into the UK-wide daily death statistics, after concerns that figures contributed by England may include deaths which occur months after a positive test. Other UK nations have a 28-day cut-off point. But Public Health England is continuing to make the figures available on the coronavirus data dashboard. It says that about 4,000 of the 45,000 deaths occurred after more than 28 days, and only 2,000 of those were not attributed by the recording doctor to Covid-19. Miami Beach has enacted a curfew amid rising cases Florida has reported its fifth consecutive day of more than 10,000 new Covid-19 cases. On Sunday, an additional 12,478 people tested positive for coronavirus, according to the state health agency. The total number of cases since March in the Sunshine State is now more than 350,000. The death toll is nearing 5,000, and hospitals across the state say bed space is filling up. As officials try to contain the surge, some parts of South Florida have enacted curfews. On Saturday, Miami Beach set a curfew of 20:00 to 05:00. On Friday, Broward County ordered a curfew from 23:00 to 05:00, in place until 1 August. Congresswoman Donna Shalala, a Democrat representing part of Miami-Dade county,told ABC News,external: ""The residents here are terrified and Iâm terrified, for the first time in my career, because thereâs a lack of leadership."" About 23% of the total number of cases were reported in just the last week,the Tampa Bay Times reports,external. In an interview aired on Sunday, US President Donald Trump told Fox News: ""We have embers and we do have flames. Florida became more flame-like, but itâs - itâs going to be under control."" More on Florida: BBC OS Lydia Guthrie said she doesn't feel ""brave or selfless"" taking part in the trial One of those who volunteered to take part in the Oxford University vaccine trial is Lydia Guthrie. She was injected on April 30th with either the experimental Covid-19 vaccine or a placebo vaccine that protects against meningitis. Lydia says she developed flu-like symptoms after having her vaccine, but was warned by the research team that this might happen. Despite the small risk that was involved, she toldBBC OS on World Service radiothat she doesnât feel âbrave or selflessâ. âItâs not that brave because I trust the people involved. Itâs also not selfless because if we find a vaccine, I will benefit just as much as anybody else,"" said Lydia. âIf we get a vaccine Iâll be able to hug my mum again, and thatâs really worth it for me.â James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News These results from the Oxford vaccine trial are exciting, but
this is only the first hurdle. It is still not a vaccine we can say âworksâ. It is great news the vaccine can induce an immune response, including both antibodies that attack the virus and
T-cells, which hunt out and kill cells infected by the virus. But we do not know what level of
immune response is needed to protect people from coronavirus. That is why
further research is still needed. The answers at the moment are
unlikely to come from the UK as there is not enough coronavirus doing the
rounds to prove whether the vaccine is making a difference. The Oxford team already has
trials under way in South Africa and Brazil and there are plans for one in the
US too. However, it may yet require
âchallenge trialsâ in which people are vaccinated and deliberately infected
with the virus to see how effective it is. Read more here. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Negative,8.972998e-11

and Claire Heald. Do join us again tomorrow. We're wrapping up today's live page shortly. But here's a quick recap of some of the main stories:  The UK economyhas ""clawed back"" about half the fall in output it saw during the peak of the coronavirus lockdownin March and April, according to the Bank of England's chief economist. Andy Haldane told MPs there had been a ""V"" shaped ""bounceback"". Last month, Mr Haldane said the economy was ""on track for a quick recovery"" - the so-called ""V"" shape. However, other economists have expressed doubts about the potential for such a swift recovery in activity. ""Roughly half of the roughly 25% fall in activity during March and April has been clawed back over the period since,"" Mr Haldane told members of the Treasury Select Committee. The economy had grown by about 1% per week, he said. ""We have seen a bounceback. So far, it has been a 'V'. That of course doesn't tell us about where we might go next,"" he added. As cases surge in a number of US states, more than a dozen National Football League (NFL) players have taken to social media to demand clarification of Covid-19 policies to keep players and their families safe. Stars including Seattle Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson and Houston Texans player JJ Watt used the Twitter hashtag #WeWantToPlay to question the NFL's safety plan as players are told to report for training camps across the country. Wilson tweeted on Sunday: ""My wife is pregnant. NFL training camp is about to start.. And there's still No Clear Plan on Player Health & Family Safety."" Infectious disease experts have put together response plans for the league's 32 teams, according to USA Today Sports. Protocols negotiated by the league and players' association include mask requirements, hand sanitising and minimising shared equipment. But players say they still have not been told how the league will handle a positive Covid-19 test among teammates, whether they can opt-out of high-risk situations, or if there will be access to daily testing, among other concerns. At least 72 NFL players have tested positive for the virus thus far, according to the players' association. So far, the NFL plans for teams to begin training camps for the next few weeks before the season begins in September. Teams will travel as they normally did, but there will be limits on the number of fans in the stadiums. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

In Texas - one of America's virus hotspots, with over 335,000 cases - the state attorney general has said that religious schools are exempt from local health restrictions. On Friday, Attorney General Ken Paxton wrote in an open letter that it would be unconstitutional to require religious schools to close under any government orders. He cited the First Amendment, which protects religious freedoms, as well as the Texas governor's, which prohibits local governments ""from closing religious institutions or dictating mitigation strategies to those institutions"". ""Religious private schools
may continue to determine when it is safe for their communities to resume in-person
instruction free from any government mandate or interference,"" Paxton said. ""Religious private
schools therefore need not comply with local public health orders to the contrary."" The guidance comes as schools across the US's second most populous state are trying to determine how to reopen amid a Covid-19 surge, with many educators saying they are afraid to resume in-person classes. Days after the attorney general's letter, and after five consecutive days of more than 10,000 new Covid-19 cases, Texas Governor Greg Abbott said US Navy medical teams have been deployed in the state to assist with battling the virus. This video can not be played Why Texas is seeing a surge in coronavirus cases Will GrantBBC News, Havana The Cuban health ministry has announced there has been no local transmission of coronavirus on the island for the first time in more than four months. There was just one case of Covid-19 registered in the past 24-hours - however, the government said the patient had travelled into Cuba from abroad. The Cuban government has been praised by the Pan American Health Organization for its robust response to the pandemic. Face masks are mandatory in most settings and the island is only very cautiously reopening under a gradual three-phased approach. Havana is currently in phase one with many economic and social activities suspended. Inter-province travel can begin again under phase two and children will only return to classes once phase three has been declared. People in Southwold say its summer visitors are returning As the UK went into lockdown, the seaside town of Southwold was pleading with visitors to stay away from its pier, golden sands and promenade lined with candy-coloured beach huts. Banners around town said that trips to the seaside or to second homes were not essential travel. ""Please respect us - don't infect us,"" they said. Nowthey're trying to encourage visitors back. At ice cream shop Beaches and Cream, Lynda Walker said the banners could not have been made by a business owner. ""We want to see holidaymakers - they're our bread and butter and we are glad they are back."" Some said the town already has ""that busy summer feeling"" but others like market stallholder Darren Crane worry that ""we haven't got many weeks left to make the money to get through the winter."" Meanwhile, officials in Wales say beauty spots are experiencing the opposite problem â they'reso overrun by visitors enjoying their restored freedom that the crowds of parked cars are ""putting lives at risk"". While outdoor dining has been allowed, indoor dining remains prohibited in New  York City New York City, once the epicentre of the pandemic in the US, is now entering the last phase of reopening - albeit with some modifications. It's the last region of the state to do so. Mayor Bill de Blasio said indoor dining and drinking would still not be allowed to resume and indoor venues like museums would remain closed. Other outdoor entertainment and sites, like professional sports, botanical gardens and zoos, can reopen with reduced capacity. Film and television production has also been given the go-ahead. It is unclear when indoor-only facilities will be allowed to reopen. The city and state are also still working on a plan to restart schools. Also on Monday, New York's Governor Andrew Cuomo will visit the southern state of Georgia, one of the states seeing a recent rise in Covid-19. Cuomo said he will meet with officials in Savannah, Georgia, to offer guidance and help with testing and tracing programmes as well as to deliver personal protective equipment. Cuomo said that health workers from across the country offered help to New York when his state was in the thick of it, and promised to repay the generosity.

Chris MasonPolitical Correspondent Coaches descend on Westminster Dozens of coaches have spent the afternoon making themselves heard in Westminster. They've been driving round in circles in Parliament Square blasting their horns - the industry says they have been forgotten by the government during the pandemic. I asked the Department for Transport for its reaction earlier this afternoon. A spokesman said the government has rovided a generous and wide-ranging package of support for businesses. ""Our job retention scheme has helped a million employers and protected more
than nine million jobs across the U.K. We have extended it until October â
meaning it will have been open for eight months and will continue to
support businesses as the economy reopens and people return to work,"" they said. They also highlighted other support measures like bounce back
loans, tax deferrals, business rates holidays and more than Â£10 billion of
grants. âLast week the Chancellor announced the second part of our support
for the economy through his Plan for Jobs, giving businesses the confidence to
retain and hire, and providing people with the tools they need to get better
jobs, including supporting jobs with a Â£1,000 Coronavirus Job Retention Bonus
for employers.â The coach industry wants help that is specifically tailored to them. Today's demonstration will no doubt not be the last - loads of industries are hurting and hurting badly, in a recession without precedent in modern times. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst An anti-mask protest that took place in Londonâs Hyde Park over the weekend is being widely mocked in China today, a country wheremandatory mask wearing because of Covid-19 has been part and parcel since the beginning of the year. Thousands have taken to Chinaâs Facebook-equivalent Sina Weibo, mocking resistance in England towards masks as a perceived restriction of freedom, even though wearing one will become mandatory in shops and supermarkets from 24 July. It comes at a time when relations between China and the UK are especially strained, withthe UK terminating its agreement with Chinese tech giant Huawei for 5G infrastructure last week, andthe UK government changing its extradition arrangements with Hong Kong. âLet them watch the âfreedomâ they value collapse,â one Weibo user says, and many speculate resistance could lead to a second wave in the country. Others joke the English are being brainwashed by conspiracy theories. âNo masks, no 5G, no vaccines = no lives,â one says. Some call the activists âapprentices of [US President] Trumpâ.

Outspoken Zimbabwean journalist Hopewell Chinâono has been arrested by police, human rights lawyer Beatrice Mtetwa has confirmed. He filmed his arrest before being told to put his phone down.

The story led to the arrest and sacking of Health Minister Obadiah Moyo President Emmerson Mnangagwa fired Mr Moyo earlier this month for âinappropriate conductâ over the $60m (Â£47.5m) medicines supply scandal. Mark SavageMusic reporter, BBC News Q Magazine, a cornerstone of rock journalism in the UK, is to close after 34 years. ""The pandemic did for us and there was nothing more to it than that,""said the editor Ted Kessler in a tweet.,externalHe also shared the editor's letter for the final issue, due on 28 July, in which he said: ""I must apologise for my failure to keep Q afloat."" The magazine's circulation had fallen to 28,000 per month from a peak of 200,000 in 2001. Founded in 1986 by Mark Ellen and David Hepworth, Q arrived at the same time as the CD revolution took off - and its glossy, aspirational format chimed perfectly with the times. Its hefty and comprehensive reviews section not only covered new releases, but the copious re-issues that were starting to appear as record labels plundered their archives to bolster the new format.

WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus The World Health Organization (WHO) has welcomed today's progress towards a vaccine but says work still needs to be done to combat the spread of Covid-19. At a briefing in Geneva, Dr Mike Ryan, director of the WHO emergencies programme, congratulated the scientists behindthe Oxford vaccine, saying: ""This is a positive result but again there is a long way to go."" He added that now, ""real world"" trials must be done on a larger scale. There are 23 potential vaccines in development thus far. ""But it is good to see more data and more products moving into this very important phase of vaccine discovery."" WHO chief Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus also emphasised that any successful vaccines must be accessible to all. He said many countries are seeing the advantages of making the vaccine ""a global public good"", but some are ""going the reverse direction"". ""When there is no consensus, it could be actually owned by those who have money and those who cannot afford it may not have access to the vaccines."" The director-general also said that while vaccine research continues, ""we have to save lives now"".

"Video-sharing app TikTok has denied accusations that it is controlled by the Chinese government. Theo Bertram, TikTok's head of public policy for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, said it would refuse any request from China to hand over data. ""The suggestion that we are in any way under the thumb of the Chinese government is completely and utterly false,"" he told the BBC. TikTok has come under pressure by Washington over its future in the US. Its owner, ByteDance, which is based in Beijing but domiciled in the Cayman Islands, has had talks with the UK government about basing its HQ in London. But the US is considering banning TikTok and may only allow it to keep operating if it splits from China and becomes an American company. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo - who is visiting the UK this week - has alleged that TikTok users in the US are at risk of their data ending up ""in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party"". Mr Bertram told the BBC's Today programme that TikTok had not made any decisions about where to site its international headquarters, but added: ""We are committed to growing further in the UK."" He added that if TikTok were approached by the Chinese government, ""we would definitely say no to any request for data"". A spokeswoman for the Department for International Trade said: ""ByteDance's decision on the location of their global HQ is a commercial decision for the company."" This video can not be played Will TikTok be banned? Mr Bertram also denied allegations that TikTok was lenient towards paedophiles caught grooming children through its app. The Daily Telegraph said it had seen leaked documents,externalshowing that users found messaging children in a sexual way had to commit three offences before incurring a permanent ban. But Mr Bertram said TikTok had changed its policy more than a year ago and that it had ""zero tolerance"" for such behaviour. Any posts of that kind would be removed and the perpetrator reported, he said. TikTok's UK headquarters in doubt amid US pressure TikTok: Chinese app may be banned in US, says Pompeo UK Huawei decision part of wider strategic tensions with China Huawei 5G kit must be removed from UK by 2027 The latest development comes as tensions mount between the UK and China over the government's recent decision to order the removal of Huawei's 5G equipment from Britain's mobile networks by 2027. There are fears it could prompt a tit-for-tat economic war between the two countries. The Chinese ambassador to the UK, Liu Xiaoming, told the Andrew Marr Show on Sunday: ""We are still evaluating the consequences. This is a very bad decision."" TikTok employs about 1,000 people in Europe, with the majority of those based in the UK and Ireland. The Sunday Times reported that a decision by TikTok to build its headquarters in the UK has the potential to create 3,000 jobs. The Chinese video-sharing platform is hugely popular and the app has been downloaded two billion times. India has already blocked TikTok as well as other Chinese apps. Australia, which has already banned Huawei and telecom equipment-maker ZTE, is also considering banning TikTok.

"Nigel Manton from Cheshire says he spent Â£10,000 on business interruption insurance for nothing ""It's a bit galling to realise... we've spent more than Â£10,000 on insurance which wasn't valid,"" says Nigel Manton, of the Fresh Skin Clinic, in Cheshire. His firm is one of hundreds that say they were wrongly denied cover for the virus and could go bust as a result. A court case to decide whether many businesses receive insurance payouts for damage caused to them by the pandemic begins on Monday. However, insurers say most business policies simply do not cover pandemics. A judge will decide on the correct interpretation of 17 so-called business interruption policies, but the ruling could affect up to 370,000 firms. ""All businesses thought they'd inoculated themselves by buying this insurance and they have found that this financial vaccine doesn't work,"" says Mr Manton. Following the lockdown, a host of businesses had to close their doors and many looked to insurers to cover their losses through their business interruption policies. Insurance firms ordered to pay out or explain However, many insurers disputed these claims, arguing that such policies were never intended for losses caused by unprecedented measures such as government-imposed lockdowns. About 400 companies have complained to the financial ombudsman, prompting City regulator the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) to bring this case. It has selected 17 examples from business interruption insurance policies used by 16 insurers, eight of whom were asked to take part in the court case. These include Hiscox, RSA Group, Arch Insurance, Argenta, Ecclesiastical, MS Amlin, QBE and Zurich, all of whom agreed to take part voluntarily. The FCA says the case will provide ""clarity and certainty for everyone involved in these business interruption disputes, policyholder and insurer alike"". The views of Mr Manton are echoed by the many businesses who've contacted the BBC over the past few months to express frustration that their business interruption insurance wouldn't pay out. After all, their business was indeed interrupted by the coronavirus pandemic, as the lockdown stopped them from using their premises, for example. Now many are crossing their fingers that the results of this case will mean their policies could pay out in future as many are - in the words of the FCA - ""under intense financial strain"". Simon Ager fears he could incur Â£200,000 of losses due to lockdown Simon Ager told the BBC his climbing company was at risk of being bankrupted because his insurer Hiscox was refusing to cover losses. According to his policy, the insurer should cover financial losses for any business unable to use their premises following ""an occurrence of any human infectious or human contagious disease, an outbreak of which must be notified to the local authority"". However, citing a separate clause, Hiscox argues that the policy was intended to cover incidents that occur only within a mile of a business Mr Ager is now part of the Hiscox Action Group, 369 of whose members are owed Â£47m in uncovered losses. They will give evidence in this week's case and have begun a separate arbitration claim against the insurer. Richard Leedham, a senior partner at law firm Mishcon de Reya, which represents the group, said: ""We can shed additional light on the matter and explain exactly why these policies should pay out and show the damage this refusal is doing to hundreds if not thousands of British businesses."" The Association of British Insurers says most business policies do not cover pandemics, as the level of risk involved would make premiums unaffordable. Instead the majority focus on property damage. Huw Evans, director general of the ABI, told the BBC: ""This is not a debate about whether these policies were intended to cover pandemics, it is a debate as to whether the wordings of these policies inadvertently cover pandemics. ""It is an argument about whether the wording allows insurers to decline the claim.""

"Kaye Flitney is one of those enrolled on the clinical trial The preliminary results of a clinical trial suggest a new treatment for Covid-19 reduces the number of patients needing intensive care, according to the UK company that developed it. The treatment from Southampton-based biotech Synairgen uses a protein called interferon beta which the body produces when it gets a viral infection. The protein is inhaled directly into the lungs of patients with coronavirus, using a nebuliser, in the hope that it will stimulate an immune response. The initial findings suggest the treatment cut the odds of a Covid-19 patient in hospital developing severe disease - such as requiring ventilation - by 79%. Patients were two to three times more likely to recover to the point where everyday activities were not compromised by their illness, Synairgen claims. It said the trial also indicated ""very significant"" reductions in breathlessness among patients who received the treatment. In addition, the average time patients spent in hospital is said to have been reduced by a third, for those receiving the new drug - down from an average of nine days to six days. UK hospital trials new coronavirus treatment drug Life-saving coronavirus drug 'major breakthrough' Coronavirus anti-viral drug 'biggest step forward' How near are we to curing coronavirus? The double-blind trial involved 101 volunteers who had been admitted for treatment at nine UK hospitals for Covid-19 infections. Half of the participants were given the drug, the other half got what is known as a placebo - an inactive substance. Stock market rules mean Synairgen is obliged to report the preliminary results of the trial. The results have not been published in a peer-reviewed journal, nor has the full data been made available; so the BBC cannot confirm the claims made for the treatment. This video can not be played Professor Tom Wilkinson: ""These are all encouraging signals... that the drug is having an important clinical effect"" But if the results are as the company says, it will be a very important step forward in the treatment of coronavirus infections. The scientist in charge of the trial, Tom Wilkinson, says if the results are confirmed in larger studies the new treatment will be ""a game changer"". The trial was relatively small but the signal that the treatment benefits patients was unusually strong, he says. ""We couldn't have expected much better results than these,"" Synairgen chief executive Richard Marsden told the BBC. He described the results as ""a major breakthrough in the treatment of hospitalised Covid-19 patients"". The BBC's Justin Rowlatt with nurse Sandy Aitken at a patient's bedside Mr Marsden said the company will be presenting its findings to medical regulators around the world in the next couple of days to see what further information they require in order to approve the treatment. That process could take months, although the British government, like many others, has said it will work as fast as possible to get promising coronavirus treatments approved. It is possible it could be given emergency approval,as the anti-viral drug remdesivir was in May. Another possibility is that permission will be given for more patients to receive the treatment with the effects being carefully monitored to confirm it is safe and effective. If it does get approval, the drug and the nebulisers used to deliver it would then need to be manufactured in large quantities. Mr Marsden says he instructed companies to start producing supplies back in April to ensure they would be available should the results be positive. He says he expects Synairgen to be able to deliver ""a few 100,000"" doses a month by the winter. Interferon beta is part of the body's first line of defence against viruses, warning it to expect a viral attack. The coronavirus seems to suppress its production as part of its strategy to evade our immune systems. This video can not be played Synairgen CEO Richard Marsden explains how the treatment uses the protein interferon beta to help fight the virus The new drug is a special formulation of interferon beta delivered directly to the airways via a nebuliser which makes the protein into an aerosol. The idea is that a direct dose of the protein in the lungs will trigger a stronger anti-viral response, even in patients whose immune systems are already weak. Interferon beta is commonly used in the treatment of multiple sclerosis. Previous clinical trials conducted by Synairgen have shown that it can stimulate an immune response and that patients with asthma and other chronic lung conditions can comfortably tolerate the treatment. No-one involved in the trial knew which patients have been given which treatment until it was over. ""If you know it's a drug, your mind might have a bias,"" explained Sandy Aitken, one of the nurses who administered the new drug to patients at Southampton Hospital. Synairgen's drug trial was the template for the Accord programme, a fast-track clinical trial scheme set up by the UK government in April to accelerate the development of new drugs for patients with Covid-19. The Synairgen team believes the drug could be even more effective at the early stages of infection. A trial exploring the effects of giving patients who are in high-risk groups the new drug as soon as they are confirmed as having Covid-19 has struggled to find volunteers because there are so few new infections at the moment. Expert in emergency medicine Prof Steve Goodacre, from the University of Sheffield, said: ""These results are not interpretable. We need the full details and, perhaps more importantly, the trial protocol. The trial should have been registered and a protocol made available before any analysis was undertaken."" Prof Naveed Sattar, professor of metabolic medicine at the University of Glasgow, said: ""The results seem very impressive, and although accepted that the trial is small with just over 100 participants, a 79% reduction in disease severity could be a game changer. ""It would be good to see the full results once presented and peer-reviewed to make sure they are robust and the trial conduct was rigorous. Also, with small numbers comes less certainty on the true level of benefit, or whether benefits vary between people with differing risk characteristics. Such work would require a larger trial but, even so, these results are very exciting."" SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now?

"Sitel said it was ""urgently investigating"" the outbreak with Public Health Scotland Six people have tested positive for coronavirus in an outbreak at a test and trace call centre in North Lanarkshire. Sitel, which carries out contact tracing for NHS England, said it was aware of a ""local outbreak"" at its Motherwell site. Deputy First Minister John Swinney toldBBC Radio's Good Morning Scotlandthe call centre has been closed. He said ""extensive contact tracing"" was under way. Sitel said it was ""urgently investigating"" the outbreak with Public Health Scotland. The company said it had requested that all staff who have been working at the site undergo testing within the next 24 hours. A spokeswoman for NHS Test and Trace said everyone at the site is currently working from home while a deep clean takes place. NHS Test and Trace is a service operated by the NHS in England to track and help prevent the spread of Covid-19 south of the border. Coronavirus in Scotland: How many cases are there? What can I now do - and what are the rules? Mr Swinney told the BBC that the situation came to light at 08:00 on Sunday and since then a number of contacts of the people who tested positive have been identified. It was a ""pretty realistic conclusion"" that there had been transmission of the virus in the office, he added - but an investigation into how it spread is being carried out. Mr Swinney also said work would need to be undertaken to ""get an understanding"" of how guidance was being followed within the facility. When asked if penalties could levied against Sitel, Mr Swinney said: ""These are all issues that will be explored, but what our primary focus is on is to make sure that we interrupt any transmission of the virus. ""The virus is at a very low level within Scottish society today, the compliance efforts of members of the public have successfully reduced the prevalence of coronavirus, but we have to keep it that way."" Mr Swinney added that actions being taken by NHS Lanarkshire and North Lanarkshire Council were ""reassuring"". The outbreak involves a call centre which carries out coronavirus contact tracing Concerns had been raised after 23 new cases of Covid-19 in Scotland were announced on Sunday, although only three of these were in the Lanarkshire health board area. This followed 21 cases being confirmed on Saturday, with both of these figures the highest recorded since mid-June. However the number of new positive test results dropped back to seven on Monday, with First Minister Nicola Sturgeon welcoming ""a reduction compared to recent days"". She said all cases ""will still be closely examined and contract tracing undertaken as appropriate"". Dr David Crome, a consultant in public health medicine at NHS Lanarkshire, said the health board was investigating the situation and putting measures in place to reduce risk. The Scottish government said contact tracing is under way following the detection of ""a small number of potentially linked cases in North Lanarkshire"". ""Where potential clusters of cases develop we must find them and act quickly to prevent further spread and we are grateful to local partners for their swift response,"" a spokesman said. The spokesman said ""a small increase in the number of cases is not unexpected as lockdown is lifted"", adding that it highlights the importance of the public co-operating with contact tracers as well as following guidelines on social distancing and wearing face coverings.

"China's cinemas are reopening after being closed for six months to help slow the spread of the coronavirus. The China Film Administration said screens in ""low-risk"" areas could open their doors again from today. As most of the country is now classified as low risk it is expected to be essentially a nationwide reopening. China's cinemas were hit hard by the shutdown that started in January, with many already forced out of business. Cinemas that reopen will be subject to a strict set of rules, including screenings being limited to 30% capacity and the number of movies shown at a venue capped at 50% of its previous volume. Customers' temperatures will be taken, and masks will have to be worn at all times by both cinema goers and staff. Tickets must be purchased online and separate groups of customers will have to sit at least a metre apart. Under the restrictions no food or drinks will be allowed to be served in cinemas. This will be a particularly major new blow as it has long been a significant part of the industry's revenues. Gigs return but social distancing poses problems Thousands of cinemas in China under threat of closure How does the 'eat out to help out' scheme work? China, which was the first epicentre of the pandemic, is the world's second largest market for movies, with the country's box offices taking in $9.2bn (Â£7.4bn) in 2019. But that figures is, unsurprisingly, expected to fall sharply due to cinema closures and domestic and Hollywood film releases being cancelled or moved online. Earlier this month China's largest cinema owner, Wanda Film, warned that it would swing to a loss for the first six months of the year. The company, which has more than 600 cinemas across the country, said it expected a loss of up to 1.6bn yuan (Â£182m), compared to a 524m yuan profit for the same time last year.

"Police officers detain protesters in Hong Kong during a rally against the new national security law Boris Johnson says the UK's extradition arrangements with Hong Kong will be changed, amid rising tensions with China. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab is expected to suspend an extradition deal with the territory later. It comes after Beijing imposed a controversialnational security lawon the ex-British colony, introducing new crimes with severe penalties. China has accused the UK of ""brutal meddling"" in its affairs. The UK has alreadyoffered residency rightsand a path to UK citizenship to around three million Hong Kongers in response to the law's imposition. Beijing has insisted it is committed to upholding international law, and has promised a ""resolute response"" if the UK withdraws from extradition arrangements. Why are the UK and China arguing about Hong Kong? UK makes citizenship offer to Hong Kong residents China's new law: Why is Hong Kong worried? The extradition treaty means that, if someone in Hong Kong is suspected of a crime in the UK, then the British authorities can ask Hong Kong to hand them over to face justice - and vice versa. The UK fears the arrangement - which has been in place for more than 30 years - could see anyone it extradites to Hong Kong being sent on to China. Hong Kong has extradition agreements with 19 other countries apart from the UK, including Canada andAustralia, which have already suspendedtheirs following the imposition there of China's new security law - which makes acts of subversion punishable by life sentences. Mr Johnson said the UK had ""concerns"" over the new law, and it had to think about the rights of people in Hong Kong to participate in democratic processes. But he added: ""There is a balance here. I'm not going to be pushed into a position of becoming a knee-jerk Sinophobe on every issue, somebody who is automatically anti-China"". ""We've got to have a calibrated approach. We're going to be tough on some things, but we're going to continue to engage."" The UK handed Hong Kong back to China in 1997 but, as part of an agreement signed at the time, it enjoys some freedoms not seen in the mainland. But political and economic relations between the UK and China have become strained in recent months. Earlier this month, the UK decided toban Chinese tech firm Huaweifrom its 5G network, citing security concerns denied by the company. The UK, US and EU have accused Beijing of undermining the ""One Country, Two Systems"" principle, which has guaranteed a high degree of autonomy for Hong Kong since it was handed back to Chinese rule in 1997. They say the security laws which came into force last month breach the terms of the1984 Joint Declaration,externalprotecting political and economic freedoms - which agreed the conditions under which Hong Kong would be run when Britain gave it back to China in 1997. Hong Kong timeline How is Hong Kong run? What is Huawei and why is it being banned? This video can not be played Tea, drugs and war: Hong Kong's British history explained The UK denounced the new lawsas ""deeply troubling"", with the foreign secretary calling the move ""a grave step"". In response, the UK has offered the 350,000 Hong Kong residents who hold British Overseas National passports - and a further 2.6 million who are eligible for them - enhanced residency rights should they wish to come to the UK and a route to possible citizenship. But China has warned it will retaliate if the UK imposes sanctions on any of its leading officials in relation to human rights offences and allegations of police brutality in Hong Kong. Proposals for an extradition treaty between Hong Kong and mainland China provoked widespread protests last year amid concerns about political interference in the Chinese judicial system and the right to a fair trial. Analysis by James Robbins, BBC Diplomatic Correspondent Suspending extradition to Hong Kong is a very obvious step to take. Even if the treaty remained fully in place, it would be hard to imagine the circumstances in which the UK would now agree to hand over any suspect to the Hong Kong authorities for trial - knowing they might end up in a Chinese mainland court, and then a prison far from Hong Kong. British suspension of the treaty - rather than outright abandonment - is quite normal. Diplomatically, it allows China a way back, however unlikely it is there will be any retreat by Beijing. The UK does not want to be the side to initiate a trade war with China, hence the focus on justice and the rule of law. China has already warned - in the context of Huawei as well as Hong Kong - that Chinese businesses may judge Britain an unsuitable or unreliable partner in future. The UK won't be the one turning up the heat in that area. But further British measures against China can't be ruled out. This video can not be played China's ambassador Liu Xiaoming: ""There is no such concentration camp in Xinjiang"" The UK has also stepped up its criticism of China's human rights record, accusing Beijing of ""gross and egregious"" abuses against the Uighur population in Xinjiang province. Mr Raab told the BBC that reports of forced sterilisation and wider persecution of the Muslim group were ""reminiscent of something not seen for a long time"". Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said his party would support a change to extradition arrangements with Hong Kong, calling it a ""step in the right direction"". But he called on the government to ""go further"" by considering immediate sanctions on Chinese officials involved in rights abuses against Uighur Muslims.

"West addressed the crowd without a microphone Kanye West has officially launched his campaign for the 2020 US presidential election, with an unorthodox rally in Charleston, South Carolina. West, 43, is running as a candidate for his self-styled ""Birthday Party"". At the event, the rapper seemed to make policy decisions off-the-cuff and made several rants, including on abortion and on abolitionist Harriet Tubman. Fans have questioned whether his last-minute bid for the White House is actually a promotional stunt. The Charleston rally did little to clarify whether his run is genuine. But a now-deleted tweet sent from West's account on Saturday, appearing to show the song list for a new album, added to the speculation. The event, held at a wedding and conference hall in the city, was said to be open to registered guests only - but West's campaign website had no function for people to register or RSVP. West appeared with ""2020"" shaved into the back of his head and wearing a protective security vest, and addressed the gathered crowd without a microphone. There were no audience microphones either, leading West to repeatedly tell the crowd to be silent so he could hear the questions being asked. This video can not be played Kanye West cried as he told the rally his father had wanted to abort him - and he ""almost killed"" his own daughter At one point he began crying when talking about abortion, saying that his parents almost aborted him: ""There would have been no Kanye West, because my dad was too busy."" He added: ""I almost killed my daughter... even if my wife [Kim Kardashian West] were to divorce me after this speech, she brought North into the world, even when I didn't want to."" Kanye West again says he will run for president Here's what President Kanye would do Kanye: 'I'm the greatest artist of all time' However he then added that he believes abortion should remain legal, but there should be financial support for struggling new mothers - suggesting that ""everybody that has a baby gets a million dollars"". ""The only thing that can free us is by obeying the rules that were given to us for a promised land,"" he said. ""Abortion should be legal because guess what? The law is not by God anyway, so what is legality?"" Kanye West became emotional when talking about his wife Kim Kardashian West and their children At another moment, he gave an impromptu monologue about 19th century abolitionist Harriet Tubman. ""Harriet Tubman never actually freed the slaves, she just had the slaves go work for other white people,"" he said. Tubman was born into slavery, but managed to escape a Maryland plantation in 1849, aged 27. She then returned to the South to rescue other slaves on the network of routes and safe houses known as ""underground railroad"", risking her own life to lead people to freedom. West also became tearful when talking about his late mother, who died in 2007 from complications during cosmetic surgery. The speech has been met with anger by some - mostly sparked by his comments about Tubman - but also with concern over West's welfare. Professor Jason Nichols, a senior lecturer in African American studies at the University of Maryland, told the BBC he feared West's rambling appearance pointed towards a ""manic episode"" - although he acknowledged he was not a psychologist. ""He has admitted in the past he has been battling mental illness and that sometimes he does not take medication. ""He was a little more coherent than he has been in other times... when he has gone on these rants, but I really believe he is in a bad place right now. He said some really bizarre things."" Professor Nichols added that he was disappointed, as he had hoped West would be able ""to push the other candidates"", had he had the right advice and support. ""I was actually interested to see what would happen, but after the event today, all that interest has just turned to worry."" West, who announced his candidacy on 4 July, has already missed the deadline to qualify for the ballot in several states. He needs to collect enough signatures to appear on the ballot in a number of others. Last week he qualified to appear on Oklahoma's presidential ballot, the first state where he met the requirements before the deadline. In order to appear on South Carolina's ballot he needs to collect 10,000 signatures by noon local time (18:00 BST) on Monday.
