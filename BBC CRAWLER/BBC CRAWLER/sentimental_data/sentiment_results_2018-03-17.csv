"Sitting president Vladimir Putin is hoping to secure another term in office Russians are voting in an election that is likely to return Vladimir Putin for a fourth term as president. Polls closed in Moscow at 17:00 GMT, with final votes due to be cast an hour later in the far west of the country. More than 100m are eligible to vote. Exit polls are expected late on Sunday. Mr Putin is hoping for another six-year term and faces seven other candidates. He said he would see as a success any result that gave him the ""right to perform the duties of president."" His comments were carried on national TV as he voted in Moscow. Mr Putin's rivals include a millionaire communist, Pavel Grudinin, a former reality television host, Ksenia Sobchak, and veteran nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky. The main opposition leader, Alexei Navalny, has been prohibited from standing, because of a fraud conviction that he has condemned as politically motivated. Mr Navalny has urged voters to boycott the election and has sent thousands of observers to polling stations to watch for possible violations. Strawberry tycoon among Putin challengers Five things to know about the election Life in Putin's Russia explained in 10 charts Ksenia Sobchak has been dismissed as a Kremlin stooge but she has taken opposing positions to Putin Vladimir Putin, 65, has been Russia's dominant leader since 1999, either as president or prime minister. Independent election monitoring group Golos reported hundreds of irregularities throughout the day: Voting papers were found in some ballot boxes before polls opened Observers were barred from entering some polling stations Some people were bussed in amid suspicion of forced voting Webcams at polling stations were obstructed by balloons and other obstacles Allow Twitter content?

Videos taken from the election commission's live stream of polling stations also appeared to show some instances of officials stuffing ballots into boxes,external. In Dagestan, election official David Sepashvili says he was prevented from doing his job by some 50 ""muscular men"", according to AFP news agency. ""They filled the entire station, blocked the ballot box in a line,"" Mr Sepashvili, a member of the polling station's election commission, said. The observer working at the station tried to reach the box to prevent ballot stuffing, but the men ""knocked him on the ground, kicked him, and then carried him outside"" before telling Mr Sepashvili to leave the premises. ""I went to the policeman at the station, but he said he can't do anything because he doesn't have a weapon,"" Mr Sepashvili said. The election commission reported 13 breaches of electoral law and its head, Ella Pamfilova, said anyone involved in violations would be caught. In some regions, free food and discounts in local shops were on offer. Analysis by Sarah Rainsford, BBC Moscow Correspondent In Rostov-on-Don, Cossacks danced outside the polling station There's a lot to do besides vote at polling stations in Moscow today. We found a man playing The Clash on a balalaika outside one, and another man dressed as a rabbit. There were competitions and games galore, and a giant sign for people to take selfies in front of, that reads: ""I've elected the president."" It's all because turnout is the big issue at this election: Vladimir Putin wants the strongest possible mandate for another six years in power. That's why the election was scheduled for 18 March - the anniversary of Russia's annexation of Crimea. Hugely controversial abroad, that act saw Mr Putin's political rating at home surge to its highest point ever. Election officials said that by 18:00 Moscow time (15:00 GMT) turnout had reached almost 60%. They had earlier spoken of a ""significantly higher"" figure than in 2012. They also said they had repelled a cyber attack on their website overnight. Thedistributed denial of service (DDoS)attack was sourced to 15 countries, they said. A 100% turnout was reported in some areas of the far east.Interfax news agency quoted an election official as saying every resident in six villages on the Kamchatka peninsula had cast their ballots.,externalThe same turnout was reported in four villages in the Chukotka region. Russia's Tass news agency said that in Moscow, turnout was 59.5% an hour before polls closed there. But opposition observers have said their estimates for turnout are significantly different form the official figures. Sunday's vote is the first in Crimea since Russia seized the region from Ukraine. The move was bitterly contested by Kiev and ratcheted up tensions between Russia and the West. As a result, Russians living in Ukraine were unable to take part in Sunday's vote because access to Russian diplomatic missions was blocked by the Kiev government.

"Tens of thousands of people have fled the Turkish military offensive in Afrin A number of civilians have been killed by Turkish shelling and air strikes while trying to flee the embattled Syrian city of Afrin, reports say. Kurdish media spoke of dozens killed and wounded on Friday night alone while a UK-based monitoring group reported further deaths on Saturday. A resident told the BBC that shells on Friday had hit cars packed with people and air strikes had hit a hospital. At least 150,000 people have reportedly fled the Kurdish-majority city. Turkey denies targeting civilians. It launched its military operation to clear the Afrin region, in northern Syria, of a US-backed Kurdish militia it considers a terrorist organisation. Turkey and its Free Syrian Army allies have captured several villages in their push to capture the city, reports say. The FSA said it had opened corridors to the south to allow civilians to escape. However, Afrin resident Ranya said shells had hit cars carrying civilians in the al-Mahmoudia area. ""Bodies were everywhere,"" she said. ""Also at night there were air strikes targeting Afrin hospital. There were a lot of victims there and due to the intensive shelling people cannot go to get the bodies. Some bodies are still there on the street."" Why is there a war in Syria? The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group said 16 people had died at the hospital. ""It was the only functioning hospital in Afrin city,"" a Kurdish Red Crescent official told the AFP news agency. Turkey, however, denied striking the hospital, insisting it had not harmed civilians during its two month-long operation. The Turkish military produced aerial photos of the hospital on Saturday which it said proved the reports were false. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The Eastern Ghouta region, near the Syrian capital Damascus, has seen a similar exodus of civilians in recent days with Russian air strikes support the Syrian government's attempts to retake the area from rebel forces. Seven years of civil war have driven nearly 12 million Syrians from their homes: At least6.1 millionare internally displaced Another5.6 millionhave fled abroad More than400,000are believed to have been killed or are missing, presumed dead Afrin, a town populated mainly by ethnic Kurds near the Turkish border, has been under bombardment from the air and the ground by Turkish forces and their local Syrian allies. Turkey is targeting the Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG), a militia that it regards as an extension of the Kurdish forces on its own territory - a banned group that Turkey considers a terrorist organisation. But Kurdish fighters in Syria have been a key ally in the fight against the Islamic State group, and have received support from the US to that end. Brusk Hasakeh, a YPG spokesman, told Reuters news agency that Turkish forces and their Syrian militia allies were trying to storm Afrin from the north but the YPG andits women's affiliate, the YPJ, were fighting back.

"Mr McCabe has spent most of his career working at the FBI Former FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe has been sacked days before he could retire with pension rights. He was fired by US Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who said an internal review found he leaked information and misled investigators. Mr McCabe denied the claims and said he was being targeted because of his involvement in the inquiry into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 election. US media say he has kept notes of his interactions with the president. If so, they may become part of the inquiry. Mr Trump has long accused Mr McCabe of bias in favour of the Democrats. He immediately praised Mr Sessions' decision to fire him. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

In December, the president appeared to taunt the then number two at the FBI, when he tweeted:  ""FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe is racing the clock to retire with full benefits. 90 days to go?!!!"" Mr McCabe had been under an internal investigation into the FBI's handling of two key inquiries during the 2016 presidential campaign - the revelations thatHillary Clinton had used a private email server while secretary of stateandsuspicions that Russia was interfering to help Mr Trump win the presidency. He stepped down from his role as deputy director in January because of the review, and had remained on the FBI's books ahead of his expected retirement. His sacking came late on Friday night. Mr Sessions, who heads the justice department, said it was the result of ""an extensive and fair investigation"" by his department and the FBI. Mr Sessions has been under pressure to decide Mr McCabe's fate ahead of his retirement Mr Sessions said the report had concluded that Mr McCabe had ""made an unauthorised disclosure to the news media and lacked candour - including under oath - on multiple occasions"". Who's who in Russia-Trump inquiry? Trump Russia: Key questions answered What is Mueller's special counsel? The report has not been released but it is thought to refer to an interview Mr McCabe authorised between two FBI officials and a Wall Street Journal reporter in October 2016 to explain the agency's position in the Clinton emails inquiry. He was then subsequently interviewed by the justice department's inspector general. Mr McCabe has issued a lengthy statement vehemently rejecting the allegations against him,externaland denouncing what he described as a campaign of attacks on his credibility. He insisted he had done nothing wrong in organising the October 2016 interview, saying ""it was the type of exchange with the media that the Deputy Director oversees several times per week"". He said of the subsequent justice department investigation that he tried to answer the questions ""truthfully and accurately"" and ""when I thought my answers were misunderstood, I contacted investigators to correct them"". This video can not be played The former director's most revealing moments ""The big picture is a tale of what can happen when law enforcement is politicized,"" he went on to say. ""Here is the reality: I am being singled out and treated this way because of the role I played, the actions I took, and the events I witnessed in the aftermath of the firing of James Comey."" Mr Comey was fired as head of the FBI in May last year by the president,who cited his handling of the Clinton email investigation but later acknowledged ""this Russia thing"" was part of the reason. Mr Comey had been leading the FBI's investigation into allegations of collusion between Trump campaign officials and Russian interference in the vote. He later told a Senate hearing that the president had asked for his ""loyalty"". Mr McCabe alleges that the release of the justice department report recommending his firing was ""accelerated"" after he indicated that he would corroborate Mr Comey's version of events. Mr Trump has been a frequent critic of Mr McCabe, whom he accuses of political bias in his roles in the Russia and Clinton email investigations. He has publicly pointed to donations that Mr McCabe's wife Jill, a Democrat, received from a Clinton ally when she ran unsuccessfully for the state Senate in Virginia in 2015. The White House said it was for the attorney general, not President Trump, to fire Mr McCabe After James Comey was fired, Mr McCabe became acting director of the FBI.Mr Trump reportedly invited him to the Oval Office and asked him who he voted for in the 2016 election.,external Mr McCabe, in his statement on Friday, said he and his family had been the targets of an ""unrelenting assault"" in the media to undermine his reputation, and said Mr Trump's tweets had ""amplified and exacerbated it all"". Citing anonymous sources on Saturday, the Associated Press news agency says Mr McCabe has kept memos of his meetings with Mr Trump. It is not clear whether they have been handed over to the special counsel leading the inquiry, Robert Mueller. Mr Comey also kept contemporaneous notes of his encounters with Mr Trump. Trump 'asked McCabe how he voted' Republican memo accuses FBI of abusing power Trump renews attack on 'disgraceful' FBI Mr McCabe had been with the FBI for two decades and was due to retire on Sunday, the day he turns 50 and can claim his federal government pension. It is not clear how much of his pension he might lose as a result of Mr Sessions' announcement. White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders on Thursday said it was for the attorney general to decide Mr McCabe's future. ""But,"" she added, ""we do think it is well documented that he has had some very troubling behaviour and by most accounts a bad actor and should have some cause for concern.""

"Police described the assault as a ""chilling"" attack on an ""innocent man"" A man has been attacked with a machete outside a city centre bar. The victim, who is in his 30s, is in hospital with life-changing injuries after he was assaulted outside Barca on Catalan Square in Manchester at about 22:10 GMT on Friday.

Det Insp Mark Davis, from Greater Manchester Police, said it was a ""chilling"" attack on an ""innocent man"". The three offenders fled from the scene on foot and with a bicycle. Police said the victim had been in the bar with friends. The attacker walked past the victim and shouted abuse at a group. The offender then turned to a friend and asked for the machete.

"This video can not be played Cliff-top homes at Hemsby could fall into the sea, police have warned Residents of 10 seaside chalets ""perilously close"" to the edge of cliffs have been evacuated as high winds and waves threaten their homes. Norfolk Police said earlier that six of the properties at Hemsby had ""a very good chance"" of going into the sea. In 2013, tidal storms saw three homes in the village washed away. Hemsby Lifeboat warned high tides due on Saturday evening and easterly 48mph (77km/h) gusts could do similar damage. BBC reporter Robby West at the scene said police had closed part of the coast road and the exposed foundations of one property, previously metres from the cliff top, could be seen. Beachy Head cliff visitors 'shocked' by rock fall photos WATCH: Sidmouth cliff-top houses losing gardens to erosion Norfolk Police and the parish council have been advising people to keep away from the beach and the dunes. However, Maurice Broom, who lives in one of the threatened properties, said he intended to stay overnight to look after his pets. ""I had 90 metres between me and the sea when I first came here only two years ago, and now I've only got nine feet,"" he added. An aerial picture shows just how close one chalet was to the cliff-top ahead of Saturday's high winds Officers had earlier warned residents of the 10 occupied properties, telling them to pack a bag in case they had to leave at short notice. Lifeboat crew members have been going door-to-door, warning them to leave.

This chalet was just a few feet from the cliff edge on Saturday morning Sgt Ben Millican, of Norfolk Police, said 13 properties in total were at risk, 10 of them occupied. ""Six of them have got a very good chance of going into the sea if the weather conditions stay as they are with the high tides coming back in the evening,"" he said. A UK Power Networks team is disconnecting power to the homes and lifeboat crews are helping people evacuate. They believe five homes are at risk, but the harsh winds are making everyone's jobs harder. The Hemsby Lifeboat team have told me waves are breaking halfway up the dune, causing sand to be washed away. They believe it's a matter of ""when"" for some of the properties, not ""if"". In the 2013 tidal surge, seven homes were badly damaged, includingthree that fell into the sea.

It comes after the Shropshire town's MP Lucy Allan said she had been ""inundated"" with reports since speaking about the issue in Parliament. West Mercia Police said the reports relate to non-recent offences. The new reports have been made since the Sunday Mirror reported that up to 1,000 girls in Telford could have been victims of CSE since the 1980s. MP 'inundated' with grooming reports 'It's not the responsibility of a child to stay safe' Telford abuse team cases 'near doubled' Assistant Chief Constable Martin Evans said he was pleased that a ""small number of victims"" have had the confidence to come forward and they were now being given appropriate support. He confirmed that since 2016 the dedicated CSE team in Telford has arrested 56 people, resulting in 29 charges, with a number of these investigations still ongoing. ""The CSE reports we have received this week relate to non-recent child sexual exploitation offences and we will be reviewing them alongside any other available information, ensuring those reporting abuse are fully supported,"" he added. ACC Evans has urged other victims, or anyone with information about crimes of this nature, to come forward. Assistant Chief Constable Martin Evans is pleased that new victims have had the ""confidence"" to come forward West Mercia Police Supt Tom Harding, who is in overall charge of policing in Telford,said police and authorities in the town were working with ""approximately 46 young people""who were victims of CSE or considered ""at risk"" and claimed reported figures had been ""sensationalised"". However, Maggie Oliver,who resigned from her role as a detective inspector on the Rochale case over the way it was handled by police, said Telford will have more child sex victims than police claim to know about. She said: ""I've been saying since I first started speaking out publicly in 2011, and I went to the Home Office to say, that the figures that were being reported were not correct, they were being under-reported, under-recorded and the Home Office select committee accepted that. ""So these figures are not fabricated in my experience."" The Home Office has said the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse will be looking at Telford in its investigation into CSE, but it is down to local authorities to decide whether a further review is necessary. Ms Allan is pushing for the council to commission a separate report, but the authority said it wants the government to launch it to ensure its ""independence and scope"" is not questioned. Seven men were jailed in 2012 as part of West Mercia Police's Operation Chalice, including brothers Ahdel Ali and Mubarek Ali Seven men were jailed in 2012 as part of West Mercia Police's Operation Chalice, including brothers Ahdel Ali and Mubarek Ali. The force said more than 100 girls could have been targeted by the gang between 2007 and 2009. Many of the seven men worked for or had connections with fast food restaurants across Telford.

"Several vehicles remain firmly buried under the 862-tonne bridge Florida officials were told ""there were no safety concerns"" about a crack in a Miami university bridge, hours before it collapsed killing six people. Florida International University (FIU) said a meeting on Thursday morning involved the engineering and construction companies, as well as Florida's transport department. University officials say they were told that the crack ""did not compromise the structural integrity"" of the bridge. It later fell on eight vehicles. In a statement, the university said the ""engineer of record"" from the contractor FIGG gave a technical presentation regarding the crack. Miami bridge collapse witness: 'This is crazy' The 862-tonne, 174ft (53m) pedestrian bridge had been newly erected the previous Saturday in just six hours. ""FIU is about building bridges and student safety. This project accomplishes our mission beautifully,"" the university had said in a press release. Allow Twitter content?

On Thursday afternoon, it collapsed on top of an eight-lane street. The following day it emerged that lead bridge engineer Denney Pate had warned of a crack in the structure in a voicemail left with the state's department of transport two days before the disaster. But the employee was away on assignment, and did not hear the message until after the bridge had fallen. In his voicemail, Mr Pate had said there was no concern ""from a safety perspective"". But ""obviously some repairs or whatever will have to be done"", he said. The voicemail made headlines when it was released by the transportation department - but there was no mention until Saturday of the meeting held on the morning of the collapse. This video can not be played Miami rescue workers search for survivors The US National Transportation Safety Board is investigating, and has not yet determined what led to the bridge coming down. ""A crack in the bridge does not necessarily mean it's unsafe,""Robert Accetta, an NTSB investigator, told the Miami Herald,external. Florida SenatorMarco Rubio tweeted that workers had been tightening cables,externalsupporting the bridge at the time it collapsed. This video can not be played Miami bridge collapse witness: 'This is crazy' The number of victims is thought likely to rise as workers clear the rubble from the 862-tonne structure, which was erected days before as a walkway for university students. On Saturday, police said the bodies of three of the victims had been recovered from two cars and taken away for identification. One other person died earlier in hospital, and several vehicles remain under the destroyed bridge. Eight people were taken to hospital in the immediate aftermath of the incident. Speaking on Saturday, police said they had ""an idea of who is in the vehicles"" but the victims had to be formally identified by medical examiners.

"The EU saw the lowest number of detected illegal border crossings last year At least 15 migrants, including five children, have died when their boat capsized as they tried to cross from Turkey, the Greek coastguard has said. About 20 are believed to have been on board, and several are unaccounted for. Coastguard vessels and helicopters are searching for more survivors off the island of Agathonisi, close to the Turkish coast. Saturday's incident is thought to be the highest death toll of migrants trying to reach Greece in months. Last year, the European Union saw the lowest number of detected illegal border crossings since the migrant crisis began four years ago, European border agency Frontex said last month, AFP reports. The EU reached deal with Turkey in 2016, which saw a decrease in the number of people crossing to Greece. Under the deal, anyone who arrives on Greek islands must be returned to Turkey unless they qualify for asylum. So far this year, there have been close to 4,000 migrants arriving by sea in the Greek islands, according to figures from the UN refugee agency, the UNHCR.

"Cambridge Analytica chief executive Alexander Nix boasted about the firm's intricate data The data firm credited with helping Donald Trump win the 2016 US election has been suspended from Facebook. At the centre of the row is University of Cambridge Dr Aleksandr Kogan who, according to Facebook, made a ""personality app"" that gathered data he then sold to third parties. Facebook said it had received reports that Cambridge Analytica and others had not destroyed all the data that was obtained, in breach of Facebook policies. Cambridge Analytica said it complied with Facebook's rules, had deleted the data after it was requested by Facebook, andno longer held or used any of the data taken from the profiles,external. The BBC has not yet been able to reach Dr Kogan. Facebook said the suspension would remain in place âpending further informationâ. Cambridge Analytica, which is not connected with the University of Cambridge, recently rose to prominence for its significant role in US President Trumpâs election campaign, where it provided intricate data on the thoughts of American voters. Former presidential advisor Steve Bannon was on its board of directors. The company also played a role in the Brexit referendum campaign. Facebookâs deputy legal counsel Paul Grewalwrote at length about the decision in a blog post.,external ""In 2015, we learned that a psychology professor at the University of Cambridge named Dr Aleksandr Kogan... violated our platform policies..."" Dr Kogan is said to have created an app called âthisisyourdigitallifeâ. It was accessed by approximately 270,000 people, Facebook said. ""In so doing, they gave their consent for [Dr] Kogan to access information such as the city they set on their profile, or content they had liked, as well as more limited information about friends who had their privacy settings set to allow it.â Users who downloaded it were told they were taking a personality prediction test that was part of a ""research app used by psychologistsâ. While that was initially true - Dr Kogan is a psychologist - Facebook said the data was then kept and sold on to third-parties including Cambridge Analytica and its parent company Strategic Communications Laboratories. Another recipient was said to be an employee at Eunoia Technologies. Mr Grewal claimed: ""Although Kogan gained access to this information in a legitimate way and through the proper channels that governed all developers on Facebook at that time, he did not subsequently abide by our rules."" Facebook told the companies which bought the data to delete it immediately, and said it was given assurances the information would be destroyed. ""Several days ago, we received reports that, contrary to the certifications we were given, not all data was deleted,"" Mr Grewal said. ""We are moving aggressively to determine the accuracy of these claims. If true, this is another unacceptable violation of trust and the commitments they made.â The firm said it would not rule out legal action over the incidents. In a statement, Cambridge Analytica said it deleted ""all the data it had received"" when it was told the information was obtained in breach of Facebook's terms of service. ""For the avoidance of doubt, no data [from Dr Kogan] was used in the work we did in the 2016 US presidential election,"" it added. The University of Cambridge said it had no reason to believe Dr Kogan, employed in its psychology department, used university facilities while gathering the data. A university spokesman said professors were able to have their own business interests - but they must be ""held in a personal capacity"". _____ Follow Dave Leeon Twitter @DaveLeeBBC,external Do you have more information about this or any other technology story?You can reach Dave directly and securely through encrypted messaging app Signal on: +1 (628) 400-7370 MPs grill data boss on election influence What does Cambridge Analytica do?

"The UK has also cut off high-level contacts with Russia after the Salisbury nerve agent attack Russia has decided to expel 23 UK diplomats, in a tit-for-tat response to the UK's expulsion of 23 of its diplomats. The British government announced plans to expel the Russian diplomats as part of its response to the Salisbury nerve agent attack. But why do countries expel diplomats? And what happens when a diplomat is told to leave the country? Russia to expel 23 UK diplomats in spy row Why the UK is expelling diplomats Diplomats around the world are granted immunity in their host country - meaning they cannot be prosecuted there. However, their right to stay in the host country can be withdrawn if they break the law, upset the host nation - or in the event of a diplomatic crisis, as between the UK and Russia right now. The Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations,externalgoverns how states interact. Under article 9 of the convention, the host country can ""at any time and for any reason"" declare a person to be persona non grata - unwelcome in their country. This video can not be played Ambassador Laurie Bristow: ""We will always do what is necessary to defend ourselves"" The host government decides which diplomats go and which ones stay. The British ambassador was summoned by Russia on Saturday, and had to go and break the news to his staff. This is what the UK did to the Russian ambassador, and what has happened in the past. UK and Malawi diplomats expelled However John Everard, former UK ambassador to North Korea, says there is ""no fixed way of telling diplomats"" who stays and who goes. Countries can summon the ambassador or issue a formal diplomatic note, he says. There is no law governing how to do it. Patric Duddy, Former US ambassador to Venezuela, was back in Washington in 2008 when he was phoned by the US state department and told he could not return to his host nation - then-PresidentHugo Chavez had announced his expulsion on the news,external. You leave, whenever the host country tells you to leave. Refusing to go is a breach of international treaties and could spark a major crisis. ""There's no bucking that,"" says Sir Christopher Meyer, former British ambassador to the US. ""They have to meet our deadlines, we have to meet theirs."" While Russia has given the UK a week for its diplomats to leave, sometimes the time can be far less - 72 hours or even 24 hours. Police cordons remain in place in parts of Salisbury, almost two weeks after the attack In the 1960s, one British insurance firm even offereda policy to protect diplomats against sudden expulsion,externalfrom Moscow. Mr Everard, also never expelled himself, compares it to being told to move by a major transnational corporation. ""You won't do any work that week,"" he says, with children's schooling one of the major issues to consider. ""You say goodbye to as many friends and colleagues as you can manage, and if you are lucky you throw a party at the end of it."" The Russians being expelled from the UK seem to have found time to do this. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

There is no official Foreign Office guidance to its staff about what to do in the event of expulsion, althoughForeign Secretary Boris Johnson tweeted on Saturday,externalthat his priority now was ""supporting those staff [who are] returning to the UK"". Sir Christopher was also never expelled himself, but he did work as a diplomat in the Soviet Union. He explains it is ""very rare"" for a person to return to the host country once declared persona non grata. Saying that though, he did know of someone who was able to go back to Russia after expulsion, applying and winning a posting there years later. ""There is no statutory period,"" he says. ""But it's not common."" This video can not be played The UK, US and Russia all addressed the UN over the use of a nerve agent on UK soil Expelled diplomats are not left waiting for the chance to return - they are reassigned ""in due course"", says Sir Christopher, even if they have specialised in one niche language.

"Rally car driver Chris Lloyd loved speed and racing against the best in the UK. Then, a devastating crash changed the course of his life and put him on the world stage. ""We were at the British Championships in 2011 and took a corner too fast,"" he says. ""The car left the road and flipped in the air and then we hit a tree upside down. ""The roof caved in which hit my head and flexed my neck."" Lloyd briefly lost consciousness then came round hanging upside down in the car. ""I can remember my arms dangling but I couldn't move anything from my neck down."" He was trapped and panicking, but the rescue was deliberately slow and strategic because the paramedics had to ensure he didn't suffer further injury. ""If they'd moved my neck in the wrong way it could have killed me,"" he says. ""They saved my life"". His co-driver escaped with ""cuts and bruises"". Lloyd was taken to hospital where he was told he was paralysed from the neck down. ""The consultant came to see me and just said life was going to be very different - I was never going to ski again or drive rally cars. ""His words stuck in my head. It was like a gauntlet dropped down to me."" Lloyd hadn't worked out what he wanted to achieve yet, but he knew, somehow, he would defy the consultant's words. He returned home and focused on rehabilitation. He had to learn the basics of how to walk again, climb the stairs, and work out how to slot back into family life. His children were aged nine and five. His daughter didn't understand what had happened but his son was fully aware. ""My boy didn't think I'd be able to play football with him and was really upset. ""That was the hardest bit,"" he says. ""I felt like I'd let my family down, to see my kids upset was something really powerful and that's why I set myself this goal."" The crash had crushed Lloyd's spinal cord and interrupted the connection between his brain and limbs - so physical movement was greatly restricted. It also reduced his energy. As well as receiving regular rehabilitation and physiotherapy, he taught himself visualisation to try and stimulate his body to function fully. He would imagine white light reaching and regenerating cells in his body to make his limbs move. ""I used to visualise my thumb moving because I couldn't move it. And then one day I got it back,"" he says. ""People don't really understand the power of your mind but, I think if you believe something can happen and you try hard enough, you can make it happen."" Lloyd was making steady progress and, while on a trip to his rehab centre in Cardiff, he spotted a poster for the then upcoming London 2012 Paralympic Games. ""That was it,"" he says. ""I set myself the goal to get to a Paralympics."" The problem was, he didn't have a sport in mind. He tried cycling, ""They told me I was too old."" He tried rowing, ""They told me I was too short."" So he figured maybe the Paras weren't for him after all, and fell back on a hobby he'd started as a teenager - skiing. Lloyd first took to the slopes as a 14 year old and continued as an adult. It is considered good for rehabilitation so he started going skiing with his family. He found it was beginning to improve his condition and quality of life. By coincidence, he heard that a disability snowsport competition was to be held and entered it. He came away with the gold medal. The British team took note and invited him to train with them, but this opened up some different challenges for him. The intensity and concentration of training made his fatigue worse and drained his cognitive function. ""It's really difficult for me to get from top to bottom of a slope because of the fatigue,"" he says. ""By the time I've come through the finish line I can barely stand and I can't really see the crowd because I've exhausted my body to the point of shut down. ""As soon as they click me out of my skis I don't really know where I am and I'm a little bit sluggish for maybe two or three days after one intense race."" It is something he has taught himself to manage. He tests his mind when it is at its most tired at the end of a training session and plays games to push and increase his mental capacity. ""I'll play reaction games, memory games. You've got to remember the course and my memory is not the best, because of the bump to the head. So I use them to push the level up a bit and to react when I'm in that race environment.  It definitely makes a difference."" Lloyd's aim was to compete in Pyeongchang. He did it. He raced in the Downhill and Super G and finished 20th and 25th respectively. He was nervous on day one but hoped to enjoy his final race. It didn't go to plan, he was late out of the gate and says he ""had to fight all the way down"". For Lloyd, the golden moment was crossing the line and seeing his family which he describes as ""amazing"". ""My aim was to get to the Paralympics so it was really emotional because I felt like I was coming to the end of my journey and I'd reached my goal.""

"This is the first time President Trump has been directly involved in the case Lawyers for US President Donald Trump are seeking $20 million (Â£14m) in damages from a porn actress he says broke a non-disclosure deal signed before the 2016 elections. They argue Stormy Daniels breached the agreement at least 20 times. The actress claims she had an affair with Mr Trump that began in 2006 and lasted several months. The president's lawyer, Michael Cohen, has said he paid her $130,000 of his own money to remain silent. This is the first time President Trump has become directly involved in the case. He ""vehemently denies"" the alleged affair. The lawyer acting for Stormy Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, this month filed a lawsuit aiming to scrap the non-disclosure agreement. Michael Avenatti said the filing by the law firm representing the president were ""unprecedented"" and ""yet another bullying tactic"" against her. The filing also sought a change of venue from state to federal court. The president and the porn star: The story explained The porn star scandal Trump can't shake Allow Twitter content?

"Academies are faring badly financially, new figures suggest Academy budgets are in an even worse state than those of council-run schools with eight out of 10 in deficit, suggest figures from their accountants. Two more years like this and the entire sector could face insolvency, says a report from the Kreston UK accountancy network which looked at 450 schools. It followsdata published on Friday which showed over a quarter of council-run secondary schools were in deficit. The government disputes the findings of both reports. The 450 schools analysed inthe Kreston UK report,externalare all audited by accountancy firms in the network and are a representative sample of academies in England, say the authors. The figures, for the year ending 31 August 2017, show that of these academies: 55% were in deficit before the effect of depreciation of assets like buildings, equipment and furniture was taken into account this rose to 80% when the accounts were adjusted to include depreciation. The report, co-authored by accountants Duncan & Toplis, calls for more money to be put into schools to avoid staff cuts. Staff make up 72% of costs in these academies, say the authors. ""This means that schools will have little choice other than to cut teacher numbers to reduce financial losses in future."" The report warns that cutting staff numbers and finding enough money for redundancy payments could accelerate some schools towards insolvency. Nick Cudmore, report author and director at Duncan & Toplis, said school senior management teams already faced tough decisions. ""Schools are doing everything they can to save as much money as possible; cutting back on staff, replacing experienced teachers with less qualified people and going cap-in-hand to parents, but it still isn't enough to avoid overspending."" He said the academies in the report were also delaying repairs and putting off replacing obsolete technology, which he warned could be more expensive in the long run. ""The whole sector will be on the verge of insolvency if they have just two more years like this one. ""Accountants can work with governors to help them save every last penny possibly, but without significant increases in public funding, this could become a full-blown crisis,"" he said. On Friday, research by independent think tank the Education Policy Institute found the number of council-run secondary schools falling into deficit had trebled to 26.1% in the four years to 2017. Both sets of figures suggest primary schools are struggling to make budgets add up The EPI analysis, which is disputed by the government, also found a significant increase in the number of primary schools in deficit. But the think-tank data excludes academies, which make up about 60% of secondaries and 20% of primaries in England, and that makes the Kreston UK data particularly significant. Of the primary academies in the Kreston UK report, almost three-quarters were in deficit before the effect of depreciation was taken into account, according to their accountants. The authors emphasise that they are accountants with ""no hidden agenda and no political allegiance. ""All we do is report on the facts in our report which is published every year."" The government says its own figures suggest that schools ""hold surpluses of more than Â£4bn and we are providing support to help them get the most out of every pound they spend"". Ministers also maintain that academy budgets are more strictly controlled than those of council-run schools and so their finances are likely to be in better health overall.

"John Bailey, 75, was elected as the Academy's President in August 2017 for a four-year term The head of the organisation behind the Oscars is facing several allegations of sexual harassment, Hollywood trade publications report. The Hollywood Reporter and Variety cite unnamed sources as saying three claims have been made against John Bailey. Mr Bailey, a cinematographer, has led the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences since last year. The body approved a new code of conduct in December after a wave of harassment allegations shook the industry. Mr Bailey, 75, has not yet commented on the reports. They first emerged in Variety magazine,,externalwhich said the academy had received three harassment complaints against Mr Bailey on Wednesday and had immediately opened a review. The academy has confirmed that a review is under way but did not say who was involved. ""The Membership Committee reviews all complaints brought against Academy members according to our Standards of Conduct process, and after completing reviews, reports to the Board of Governors,"" it said in a brief statement. How the Weinstein scandal unfolded How 'MeToo' exposed the scale of abuse Who are Time's ""silence breakers""? Mr Bailey's work includes the films American Gigolo, The Big Chill and Groundhog Day. He was awarded the American Society of Cinematographers Lifetime Achievement Award in 2015. Two weeks ago he told the annual luncheon for Oscar nominees that what he called the ""fossilised bedrock"" of Hollywood's worst abuses was being ""jack-hammered into oblivion"". He was elected as the academy's president for a four-year term in August 2017, shortly before the first high-profile allegations about Hollywood abuse emerged in US media. The academy drew up a new code of conduct in response, warning its more than 8,000 members that it had ""no place"" for people ""who abuse their status, power or influence in a manner that violates recognised standards of decency"".

"UK police have begun to contact a number of Russian exiles to discuss their safety as they investigate the murder of businessman Nikolai Glushkov. The 68-year-old's body was discovered at his south-London home on 12 March. A post-mortem examination has found he died from ""compression to the neck"". The UK granted Mr Glushkov political asylum in 2010 after he fled Moscow. The BBC has been told police and the security services have reassessed their view that other exiles are at low risk. Police say there is no evidence at this stage linking Mr Glushkov's death to thepoisoning of former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia, in Salisbury on 4 March. It comes asRussia said it would expel 23 British diplomatsamid tensions with the UK over the incident. Nikolai Glushkov had been living in the UK since 2010 The Metropolitan Police launched a murder investigation on Friday after post-mortem results indicated Mr Glushkov had died from ""compression to the neck"". They said the force's Counter Terrorism Command would continue to take charge of the investigation ""because of the associations Mr Glushkov is believed to have had"". Detectives are said to be keeping an open mind and are appealing for any information that will assist the investigation. In particular, they are appealing for anyone who may have seen or heard anything suspicious at or near his home in Clarence Avenue, New Malden, between Sunday 11 March and Monday 12 March to contact them. Mr Glushkov was the former deputy director of Russian state airline Aeroflot. He was jailed in Russia in 1999 for five years after being charged with money laundering and fraud. Who was Russian businessman Nikolai Glushkov? Russia spy poisoning: Rudd says inquiry widened to other deaths Sergei Skripal and the 14 deaths under scrutiny Vladimir Putin most likely behind Salisbury attack, says Boris Johnson After being given a suspended sentence for another count of fraud in 2006, he was granted political asylum in the UK. He was due to appear in court in London this week.  The Russian authorities were pursuing him for more than Â£100m of Aeroflot's money. He had also been a close friend of Boris Berezovsky, who also lived in Britain and died in 2013. Both men were critics of President Vladimir Putin. Mr Berezovsky was found hanged in the bathroom of his former wife's Berkshire home in 2013 and an inquest recorded an open verdict, but Mr Glushkov was said to have been convinced he and other exiles had been murdered. Former PR and advertising executive Lord Bell, who was a close friend of Mr Glushkov, said he was ""concerned"" his friend's past might have made Russia consider him to have worked against the state. BuzzFeed News claimed to have evidence,externalof 14 deaths in the UK that were actually murders by the Russian state or mafia allies, including that of Mr Berezovsky. In each of the cases, police investigations and inquests did not find evidence of any crime. Mr Glushkov's death comes in the same week asHome Secretary Amber Rudd announced that some of the deaths are to be reinvestigatedby the police and MI5. Moscow has denied any involvement in the attack on Sergei and Yulia Skripal, which is being treated as attempted murder.  The pair remain in a critical but stable condition in hospital. The UK government says the Skripals were poisoned with a nerve agent of a type developed by Russia called Novichok, and Prime Minister Theresa May said she believed Moscow was ""culpable"". Foreign SecretaryBoris Johnson went on to say on Friday that Russian President Vladimir Putin was ""overwhelmingly likely"" to have ordered the nerve agent attack. The UKis to expel 23 Russian diplomatsas part of a ""full and robust"" response - a move that has prompted Russia to say it would expel 23 British diplomats from Moscow. Who was Nikolai Glushkov?

"Academies are faring badly financially, new figures suggest Academy budgets are in an even worse state than those of council-run schools with eight out of 10 in deficit, suggest figures from their accountants. Two more years like this and the entire sector could face insolvency, says a report from the Kreston UK accountancy network which looked at 450 schools. It followsdata published on Friday which showed over a quarter of council-run secondary schools were in deficit. The government disputes the findings of both reports. The 450 schools analysed inthe Kreston UK report,externalare all audited by accountancy firms in the network and are a representative sample of academies in England, say the authors. The figures, for the year ending 31 August 2017, show that of these academies: 55% were in deficit before the effect of depreciation of assets like buildings, equipment and furniture was taken into account this rose to 80% when the accounts were adjusted to include depreciation. The report, co-authored by accountants Duncan & Toplis, calls for more money to be put into schools to avoid staff cuts. Staff make up 72% of costs in these academies, say the authors. ""This means that schools will have little choice other than to cut teacher numbers to reduce financial losses in future."" The report warns that cutting staff numbers and finding enough money for redundancy payments could accelerate some schools towards insolvency. Nick Cudmore, report author and director at Duncan & Toplis, said school senior management teams already faced tough decisions. ""Schools are doing everything they can to save as much money as possible; cutting back on staff, replacing experienced teachers with less qualified people and going cap-in-hand to parents, but it still isn't enough to avoid overspending."" He said the academies in the report were also delaying repairs and putting off replacing obsolete technology, which he warned could be more expensive in the long run. ""The whole sector will be on the verge of insolvency if they have just two more years like this one. ""Accountants can work with governors to help them save every last penny possibly, but without significant increases in public funding, this could become a full-blown crisis,"" he said. On Friday, research by independent think tank the Education Policy Institute found the number of council-run secondary schools falling into deficit had trebled to 26.1% in the four years to 2017. Both sets of figures suggest primary schools are struggling to make budgets add up The EPI analysis, which is disputed by the government, also found a significant increase in the number of primary schools in deficit. But the think-tank data excludes academies, which make up about 60% of secondaries and 20% of primaries in England, and that makes the Kreston UK data particularly significant. Of the primary academies in the Kreston UK report, almost three-quarters were in deficit before the effect of depreciation was taken into account, according to their accountants. The authors emphasise that they are accountants with ""no hidden agenda and no political allegiance. ""All we do is report on the facts in our report which is published every year."" The government says its own figures suggest that schools ""hold surpluses of more than Â£4bn and we are providing support to help them get the most out of every pound they spend"". Ministers also maintain that academy budgets are more strictly controlled than those of council-run schools and so their finances are likely to be in better health overall.

"UK police have begun to contact a number of Russian exiles to discuss their safety as they investigate the murder of businessman Nikolai Glushkov. The 68-year-old's body was discovered at his south-London home on 12 March. A post-mortem examination has found he died from ""compression to the neck"". The UK granted Mr Glushkov political asylum in 2010 after he fled Moscow. The BBC has been told police and the security services have reassessed their view that other exiles are at low risk. Police say there is no evidence at this stage linking Mr Glushkov's death to thepoisoning of former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia, in Salisbury on 4 March. It comes asRussia said it would expel 23 British diplomatsamid tensions with the UK over the incident. Nikolai Glushkov had been living in the UK since 2010 The Metropolitan Police launched a murder investigation on Friday after post-mortem results indicated Mr Glushkov had died from ""compression to the neck"". They said the force's Counter Terrorism Command would continue to take charge of the investigation ""because of the associations Mr Glushkov is believed to have had"". Detectives are said to be keeping an open mind and are appealing for any information that will assist the investigation. In particular, they are appealing for anyone who may have seen or heard anything suspicious at or near his home in Clarence Avenue, New Malden, between Sunday 11 March and Monday 12 March to contact them. Mr Glushkov was the former deputy director of Russian state airline Aeroflot. He was jailed in Russia in 1999 for five years after being charged with money laundering and fraud. Who was Russian businessman Nikolai Glushkov? Russia spy poisoning: Rudd says inquiry widened to other deaths Sergei Skripal and the 14 deaths under scrutiny Vladimir Putin most likely behind Salisbury attack, says Boris Johnson After being given a suspended sentence for another count of fraud in 2006, he was granted political asylum in the UK. He was due to appear in court in London this week.  The Russian authorities were pursuing him for more than Â£100m of Aeroflot's money. He had also been a close friend of Boris Berezovsky, who also lived in Britain and died in 2013. Both men were critics of President Vladimir Putin. Mr Berezovsky was found hanged in the bathroom of his former wife's Berkshire home in 2013 and an inquest recorded an open verdict, but Mr Glushkov was said to have been convinced he and other exiles had been murdered. Former PR and advertising executive Lord Bell, who was a close friend of Mr Glushkov, said he was ""concerned"" his friend's past might have made Russia consider him to have worked against the state. BuzzFeed News claimed to have evidence,externalof 14 deaths in the UK that were actually murders by the Russian state or mafia allies, including that of Mr Berezovsky. In each of the cases, police investigations and inquests did not find evidence of any crime. Mr Glushkov's death comes in the same week asHome Secretary Amber Rudd announced that some of the deaths are to be reinvestigatedby the police and MI5. Moscow has denied any involvement in the attack on Sergei and Yulia Skripal, which is being treated as attempted murder.  The pair remain in a critical but stable condition in hospital. The UK government says the Skripals were poisoned with a nerve agent of a type developed by Russia called Novichok, and Prime Minister Theresa May said she believed Moscow was ""culpable"". Foreign SecretaryBoris Johnson went on to say on Friday that Russian President Vladimir Putin was ""overwhelmingly likely"" to have ordered the nerve agent attack.

"Adrian Lamo was behind hack attacks on Microsoft and the New York Times Adrian Lamo, a computer hacker best known for passing on information that led to the arrest of Chelsea Manning, has died aged 37. In online messaging conversations, Manning confided in him, describing confidential military material Manning had sent to Wikileaks. Wikileaks published the video of a US helicopter strike that killed seven people, including a journalist working for the Reuters news agency. The cause of Lamoâs death, confirmed to the BBC by the Sedgwick County coroner in Kansas, has not yet been made public. On Facebook, his father Mario wrote: âWith great sadness and a broken heart I have to let know all of Adrian's friends and acquittances [sic] that he is dead. A bright mind and compassionate soul is gone, he was my beloved son.â Lamo's own record as a hacker included some high-profile targets, such as Microsoft and the New York Times. Speaking to the Guardian newspaper in 2011,external, Lamo described his decision to give up Manning as ânot one I decided to make, but was thrust upon meâ. Lamo said he would have ""lasting regret"" if Manning was handed a long sentence. Manning, known at the time as Bradley Manning, was eventually sentenced to 35 years in prison. However, President Barack Obama later commuted her sentence and she was released in May 2017. She is now attempting to become the Senator for Maryland, her home state. Wikileaks founder Julian Assange on Friday described Lamo as a âpetty conman and betrayer of basic human decencyâ.

"This video can not be played Amber Rudd speaking after a Cobra meeting. A string of deaths on UK soilare to be reinvestigated by the police and MI5 after claims of Russian involvement, Home Secretary Amber Rudd says. BuzzFeed News claimed to have evidence,externalof 14 deaths that were actually murders by the Russian state or mafia allies. In each of the cases, police investigations and inquests did not find evidence of any crime. Russia has denied being involved inthe poisoning of former spy Sergei Skripal and his daughterlast week. The deaths that Buzzfeed identified include those of Boris Berezovsky, an outspoken critic of the Kremlin and a friend of Alexander Litvinenko - whose death from radiation poisoning caused a long-running diplomatic spat between the UK and Russia - and whistle-blower Alexander Perepilichnyy. Mr Perepilichnyy died while jogging in 2012. Police said they found no evidence he was poisoned. An inquest into his death resumes in April. Despite Ms Rudd's statement, Surrey Police said it would not be reopening the investigation into Mr Perepilichnyy's death. Mr Berezovsky was found hanged in his bathroom in 2013. Police said a post-mortem showed no sign of a violent struggle. BuzzFeed News reported that US intelligence sources believe these deaths were two of 14 assassinations linked to Russia. Boris Berezovsky was found dead in 2013. In a letter to MPs, Ms Rudd said the government ""takes seriously any suggestion that a foreign state has engaged in murder on UK soil"". Yvette Cooper, Labour MP and chairwoman of the home affairs select committee, had written to Ms Rudd last week asking for the investigations to be reopened. She welcomed the decision to do so, saying: ""Given the gravity of these issues, it is... right that the authorities should reassure us that they have looked at any further allegations or relevant evidence put forward in any other cases."" She added: ""The government must satisfy itself that the correct finding was reached in each case and the public need to know that relevant questions about wider Russia links have been investigated and answered.""

"Tesla's Elon Musk is facing a vote on pay that will be a signal of confidence in the company Electric carmaker Tesla, facing pressure on a number of fronts, is asking shareholders for a show of support for chief executive Elon Musk. The firm has called a special meeting this month for investors to vote on a 10-year compensation plan for Mr Musk. Under the plan, Mr Musk could receive stock awards worth an estimated $2.6bn - among the largest in US history. The grants would only be distributed if the firm, which has made consistent losses, hits certain milestones. Major holders of Tesla stock, including investment firms Baillie Gifford and T Rowe Price, have said they intend to support the pay plan, providing a vote of confidence. But shareholder advisory groups have cautioned against the proposal, saying it is too generous. The vote comes as Tesla confronts several years of mounting questions about its operations. Investors are impatient about delays in the production of Model 3 cars, a new model that is supposed to target a more mass-market clientele. US regulators have raised questions about the firm's financial disclosures, while some shareholders have complained aboutthe board's independenceand its2016 decision to buy SolarCity, a money-losing solar power company backed by Mr Musk and led by his cousin. Outside the financial world, people have voicedconcerns about the firm's autopilot featuresand workers have spoken out about abrupt dismissals and a discriminatory work environment. Tim Calkins says Tesla is a brand ""under fire"" Tesla has said the claims are without merit and its high public profile makes it a target. Several of the shareholder lawsuits have been dismissed. But financial analysts are sounding warnings that the firm is losing ground against competitors. Share prices have sunk since June, though they remain about 25% higher than a year ago. Surveys suggest the public remains enthusiastic about Tesla, though the issues may be having an effect. A Harris Poll ranked the company's reputation third out of 100 American firms. But recent analysis by Netbase, which tracks social media posts, found Tesla compared poorly to other luxury brands. Tesla shares started trading at $17 and now are worth roughly $325 ""There's no question that the Tesla brand is a bit under fire,"" says Tim Calkins, a marketing professor at Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management. Belief in Tesla - and Mr Musk - has helped the firm to fend off naysayers so far. But Mr Calkins warns the steady drumbeat of negative press threatens to erode that faith, just as the firm is trying to win over a wider audience. ""They've raised expectations of everybody really, and when you fall short of expectations, people forgive you for a while, if you're a brand they like,"" Mr Calkins says. ""If you're Elon Musk, what you're counting on is that the future is so compelling that people are going to give you time."" For years, Mr Musk has had a seemingly magical touch, defying doubts about his endeavours. These also includerocket company SpaceXandNeuralink, which is looking at ways to meld human and computer intelligence. As chief executive of Tesla since 2008, he has won billions from investors and governments, leading the company as it has grown to employ almost 40,000 people. The stock market values Tesla at about $55bn - more than Ford and General Motors - even though Tesla made only about 105,000 cars last year, less than 2% of Ford's total. Steve Westly, founder of the Westly Group, a venture fund, was an early Tesla backer and sat on its board. He credits Tesla with nudging the auto industry toward electric vehicles. ""By any standard, Elon Musk has done an extraordinary job,"" he says. ""While he may have missed the boat or been imperfect on some things, on balance you just have to be impressed with what this guy has accomplished."" Elon Musk: The man who sent his sports car into space Others take a starkly different view, pointing to Tesla's consistent losses, more than $10bn in debt and repeated failure to meet manufacturing forecasts. ""To date, the company has not actually been very successful if you judge it by any normal metrics,"" says Bradford Cornell, a professor of financial economics at CalTech and president of SMBP LLC, a hedge fund, who believes the stock is overpriced. Tesla supporters say critics overlook investments the firm is making toward its future. On a recent call with financial analysts, Mr Musk professed to be ""cautiously optimistic"" that Tesla would start to turn a profit in 2018. But concerns such as Mr Cornell's have made Tesla an attractive target for short-sellers, who are wagering the stock will fall. More bets are now levelled against Tesla than almost any other company in the US - and investors added to their positions last year even as the stock continued to rise, says Ihor Dusaniwsky, head of predictive analytics for S3 Partners, a financial analytics firm that tracks short interest. ""It's really a one-of-a-kind stock in that sense,"" he says. In an interview with Rolling Stone last year, Mr Musk described short-sellers as ""jerks who want us to die"", blaming them for a campaign to amplify negative rumours. Criticism of the pay proposal has focused primarily on its cost, not the firm's performance. Tesla has fallen short of its production forecasts The plan conditions the first set of awards on the firm roughly doubling its performance against metrics that include market capitalisation. For Mr Musk to receive the full grant, the firm would have to become a roughly $650bn company. John Roe, head of analytics for Institutional Shareholder Services, described the goals as ""rigorous"". ""They're trying to do the right thing with these new grants, or at least establish the right message that Musk is going to be aligned with shareholders,"" he says. But he also points out Mr Musk - whose net worth Forbes estimates at more than $20bn, much of it in Tesla stock - already has a lot riding on Tesla. He owns about 22% of the company, which could rise closer to 30% under the proposal. Tesla has said the performance targets tie Mr Musk's interests to shareholders, while offering an award ""commensurate with the difficulty of achieving"" the goals. Victor Li, executive vice president for governance advisory at Kingsdale Advisors, says if the vote on pay goes Tesla's way, that will strengthen Mr Musk's mandate. ""Investors - they are betting on him,"" he says.

"Cambridge Analytica chief executive Alexander Nix boasted about the firm's intricate data The data firm credited with helping Donald Trump win the 2016 US election has been suspended from Facebook. At the centre of the row is University of Cambridge Dr Aleksandr Kogan who, according to Facebook, made a ""personality app"" that gathered data he then sold to third parties. Facebook said it had received reports that Cambridge Analytica and others had not destroyed all the data that was obtained, in breach of Facebook policies. Cambridge Analytica said it complied with Facebook's rules, had deleted the data after it was requested by Facebook, andno longer held or used any of the data taken from the profiles,external. The BBC has not yet been able to reach Dr Kogan. Facebook said the suspension would remain in place âpending further informationâ. Cambridge Analytica, which is not connected with the University of Cambridge, recently rose to prominence for its significant role in US President Trumpâs election campaign, where it provided intricate data on the thoughts of American voters. Former presidential advisor Steve Bannon was on its board of directors. The company also played a role in the Brexit referendum campaign. Facebookâs deputy legal counsel Paul Grewalwrote at length about the decision in a blog post.,external ""In 2015, we learned that a psychology professor at the University of Cambridge named Dr Aleksandr Kogan... violated our platform policies..."" Dr Kogan is said to have created an app called âthisisyourdigitallifeâ. It was accessed by approximately 270,000 people, Facebook said. ""In so doing, they gave their consent for [Dr] Kogan to access information such as the city they set on their profile, or content they had liked, as well as more limited information about friends who had their privacy settings set to allow it.â Users who downloaded it were told they were taking a personality prediction test that was part of a ""research app used by psychologistsâ. While that was initially true - Dr Kogan is a psychologist - Facebook said the data was then kept and sold on to third-parties including Cambridge Analytica and its parent company Strategic Communications Laboratories.

"Tesla's Elon Musk is facing a vote on pay that will be a signal of confidence in the company Electric carmaker Tesla, facing pressure on a number of fronts, is asking shareholders for a show of support for chief executive Elon Musk. The firm has called a special meeting this month for investors to vote on a 10-year compensation plan for Mr Musk. Under the plan, Mr Musk could receive stock awards worth an estimated $2.6bn - among the largest in US history. The grants would only be distributed if the firm, which has made consistent losses, hits certain milestones. Major holders of Tesla stock, including investment firms Baillie Gifford and T Rowe Price, have said they intend to support the pay plan, providing a vote of confidence. But shareholder advisory groups have cautioned against the proposal, saying it is too generous. The vote comes as Tesla confronts several years of mounting questions about its operations. Investors are impatient about delays in the production of Model 3 cars, a new model that is supposed to target a more mass-market clientele. US regulators have raised questions about the firm's financial disclosures, while some shareholders have complained aboutthe board's independenceand its2016 decision to buy SolarCity, a money-losing solar power company backed by Mr Musk and led by his cousin. Outside the financial world, people have voicedconcerns about the firm's autopilot featuresand workers have spoken out about abrupt dismissals and a discriminatory work environment. Tim Calkins says Tesla is a brand ""under fire"" Tesla has said the claims are without merit and its high public profile makes it a target. Several of the shareholder lawsuits have been dismissed. But financial analysts are sounding warnings that the firm is losing ground against competitors. Share prices have sunk since June, though they remain about 25% higher than a year ago. Surveys suggest the public remains enthusiastic about Tesla, though the issues may be having an effect. A Harris Poll ranked the company's reputation third out of 100 American firms. But recent analysis by Netbase, which tracks social media posts, found Tesla compared poorly to other luxury brands. Tesla shares started trading at $17 and now are worth roughly $325 ""There's no question that the Tesla brand is a bit under fire,"" says Tim Calkins, a marketing professor at Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management. Belief in Tesla - and Mr Musk - has helped the firm to fend off naysayers so far. But Mr Calkins warns the steady drumbeat of negative press threatens to erode that faith, just as the firm is trying to win over a wider audience. ""They've raised expectations of everybody really, and when you fall short of expectations, people forgive you for a while, if you're a brand they like,"" Mr Calkins says. ""If you're Elon Musk, what you're counting on is that the future is so compelling that people are going to give you time."" For years, Mr Musk has had a seemingly magical touch, defying doubts about his endeavours. These also includerocket company SpaceXandNeuralink, which is looking at ways to meld human and computer intelligence. As chief executive of Tesla since 2008, he has won billions from investors and governments, leading the company as it has grown to employ almost 40,000 people. The stock market values Tesla at about $55bn - more than Ford and General Motors - even though Tesla made only about 105,000 cars last year, less than 2% of Ford's total. Steve Westly, founder of the Westly Group, a venture fund, was an early Tesla backer and sat on its board. He credits Tesla with nudging the auto industry toward electric vehicles. ""By any standard, Elon Musk has done an extraordinary job,"" he says. ""While he may have missed the boat or been imperfect on some things, on balance you just have to be impressed with what this guy has accomplished."" Elon Musk: The man who sent his sports car into space Others take a starkly different view, pointing to Tesla's consistent losses, more than $10bn in debt and repeated failure to meet manufacturing forecasts. ""To date, the company has not actually been very successful if you judge it by any normal metrics,"" says Bradford Cornell, a professor of financial economics at CalTech and president of SMBP LLC, a hedge fund, who believes the stock is overpriced. Tesla supporters say critics overlook investments the firm is making toward its future. On a recent call with financial analysts, Mr Musk professed to be ""cautiously optimistic"" that Tesla would start to turn a profit in 2018. But concerns such as Mr Cornell's have made Tesla an attractive target for short-sellers, who are wagering the stock will fall. More bets are now levelled against Tesla than almost any other company in the US - and investors added to their positions last year even as the stock continued to rise, says Ihor Dusaniwsky, head of predictive analytics for S3 Partners, a financial analytics firm that tracks short interest. ""It's really a one-of-a-kind stock in that sense,"" he says. In an interview with Rolling Stone last year, Mr Musk described short-sellers as ""jerks who want us to die"", blaming them for a campaign to amplify negative rumours. Criticism of the pay proposal has focused primarily on its cost, not the firm's performance. Tesla has fallen short of its production forecasts The plan conditions the first set of awards on the firm roughly doubling its performance against metrics that include market capitalisation. For Mr Musk to receive the full grant, the firm would have to become a roughly $650bn company. John Roe, head of analytics for Institutional Shareholder Services, described the goals as ""rigorous"". ""They're trying to do the right thing with these new grants, or at least establish the right message that Musk is going to be aligned with shareholders,"" he says. But he also points out Mr Musk - whose net worth Forbes estimates at more than $20bn, much of it in Tesla stock - already has a lot riding on Tesla. He owns about 22% of the company, which could rise closer to 30% under the proposal. Tesla has said the performance targets tie Mr Musk's interests to shareholders, while offering an award ""commensurate with the difficulty of achieving"" the goals. Victor Li, executive vice president for governance advisory at Kingsdale Advisors, says if the vote on pay goes Tesla's way, that will strengthen Mr Musk's mandate. ""Investors - they are betting on him,"" he says.

"This video can not be played ""Our quarrel is with Putin's Kremlin,"" Boris Johnson says. Russian President Vladimir Putin is ""overwhelmingly likely"" to have ordered the nerve agent attack on an ex-spy and his daughter, Boris Johnson has said. The foreign secretary said ""our quarrel is with Putin's Kremlin, and with his decision"" over the Salisbury incident. Russia denies involvement and said the accusations against Mr Putin were ""shocking and unforgivable"". Meanwhile, the head of Nato told the BBC that Russia has underestimated the ""resolve and unity"" of the UK's allies. Speaking during a visit to a west London military museum with the Polish foreign minister, Mr Johnson said the UK's ""quarrel is with Putin's Kremlin"". ""We think it overwhelmingly likely that it was his decision to direct the use of a nerve agent on the streets of the UK, on the streets of Europe, for the first time since the Second World War,"" he said. Russian ex-spy Sergei Skripal, 66, and his daughter Yulia Skripal, 33, remain critically ill in hospital, after they were found unconscious on a bench in the Wiltshire city on 4 March. The UK government says they were poisoned with a nerve agent of a type developed by Russia called Novichok, and PM Theresa May said she believed Moscow was ""culpable"". Sergei Skripal, 66, and his daughter Yulia, 33, are in a critical condition in hospital Mrs May has said the UKwill expel 23 Russian diplomatsas part of a ""full and robust"" response - prompting Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov to say it will ""certainly"" expel British diplomats in response. Conspiracy theories and denial in Russia Why does UK think it was Russia? What are Novichok agents and what do they do? How is the UK retaliating against Russia? Russian spy attack: What we know so far UK Russia response going to plan so far Russia's investigative committee said it had opened a criminal case investigation into the ""attempted murder"" of Ms Skripal and ""the murder"" of Nikolai Glushkov, aRussian exile who was found deadin his home in London on Monday. According to Russian news agency Tass, the Russian ambassador to Britain, Alexander Yakovenko, said the UK claimed the nerve agent used was A-234, but this has not been confirmed. A Downing Street spokesman said the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) has been invited to come to the UK to take a sample of the nerve agent - that process is expected to begin ""imminently"". By Gordon Corera, BBC security correspondent The implication of the ambassador's comments is that the Russians have been told by the British the exact nerve agent deployed. So far, British officials have not confirmed that they have communicated this to Moscow or that A-234 was the exact agent deployed. Based on public sources, A-234 is one of the Novichok family of agents. It has been reported that it is at least five to eight and possibly 10 times as strong as VX. Little is known about it but the symptoms are very similar to those which eyewitnesses attributed to Sergei and Yulia Skripal. In military handbooks it is described as a ""delayed casualty agent"" - its persistence depends upon how it is used, as well as the weather. On Friday, Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said the alliance had ""no reason to doubt the findings and assessments by the British government"" which suggested Russian responsibility. He said the ""UK is not alone"" and Nato allies gave ""strong political support"" to Britain, followinga joint statement from the US, France and Germanybacking Mrs May's government and a pledge of support from Australia. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Stoltenberg said the incident was part of a ""pattern of reckless behaviour"" from Russia, following allegations of cyber attacks and election meddling in recent years. ""It is important that Russia gets a clear signal that it costs to behave the way they behave,"" Mr Stoltenberg said. This video can not be played The BBC's Gordon Corera considers how likely is it Russia poisoned Sergei Skripal and his daughter ""I'm absolutely certain that Russia has underestimated the resolve and unity of Nato allies when we have implemented different kinds of sanctions over the last years,"" Mr Stoltenberg added. But Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia was not worried by international expressions of support for the UK and challenged Britain to ""provide some confirmation"". He said: ""Sooner or later, the British will have to show some proof to those 'colleagues' who say they are with UK on this; sooner or later will have to stand up its accusations."" Ahead of an EU leaders' summit, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said discussions of a potential boycott of the World Cup in Russia are ""not an immediate priority"". It comes as Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has written in the Guardianwarning against ""hasty judgements"", and not to ""rush ahead of the evidence"". Wiltshire Police said 131 people had been identified as potentially being exposed to the nerve agent - but none has shown any symptoms. Salisbury District Hospital has also assessed 46 people who came forward expressing health concerns but they were not admitted. In a letter to the Times, Salisbury NHS Trust emergency medical consultant Stephen Davies said only three people - the Skripals and Det Sgt Nick Bailey - had needed treatment. Det Sgt Bailey remains in a serious but stable condition in hospital after being contaminated with the chemical. Public Health England said the risk posed to the public remains low but theyrepeated their advice for anyone who had been to the Mill pub or Zizzito wash their clothes and possessions. A spokesperson said while it was clear a ""significant dose"" could have a ""serious immediate effect"", anyone in either venue ""could only have been exposed to extremely small traces"" and no further cases of illness have been reported. Defence secretary tells Russia: Shut up Laura Kuenssberg: Spy row stokes Labour foreign policy divisions Allies condemn nerve agent attack May visits Salisbury after 'brazen' attack Corbyn aide queries proof of Russian guilt Russia's ambassador to Britain Alexander Yakovenko claimed the UK had angled allegations against Russia to ""divert attention from Brexit"". He criticised the lack of transparency and said: ""Nobody saw even the pictures of these people in a hospital, whether they are alive or maybe they are in good health. Nobody talked to the doctors."" And Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Russia had asked the UK to take action under the Chemical Weapons Convention. He also responded to Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson - whopreviously said Russia should ""go away"" and ""shut up""- saying: ""Maybe he lacks education."" Some 220 police officers from 16 forces, 80 ambulance staff, 50 fire officers, 200 armed forces personnel and 250 specialist officers have so far been deployed as part of the investigation, Wiltshire Police said. Police cordons remain in place in parts of Salisbury, 12 days on from the attack Zizzi restaurant, the Mill pub and the bench where the Skripals sat are among locations taped off by police On Thursday,Mrs May visited Salisburyto speak to emergency service workers, public health experts and local business owners who are affected by the police cordons. Wiltshire Council has announced measures to help affected businesses, including free park and ride journeys and waived business rates. Mr Skripalis a retired colonel in the Russian military intelligence service. He was jailed by Moscow in 2006 for secretly working for Britain's MI6 but was later released and allowed to come to the UK.

"Para ice hockey is a fast-paced, action-fuelled game which packs out the stadium at the Winter Paralympics. But imagine being the only woman on the ice. Lena Schroeder was a self-conscious 15-year-old when she first discovered para ice hockey. She had just signed up to a newly formed team when, coincidentally, a friend sent her a text to tell her about it. ""I had no experience with hockey whatsoever,"" she says. ""Neither standing up hockey nor sitting hockey, so I just decided I would try it. I instantly loved it."" Schroeder, now 25, was born with spina bifida, a condition which for her means she can walk and stand but gets tired quickly. ""I walked a lot before, but my legs have got weaker and weaker so I use the wheelchair now,"" she says. Because she walked a lot at 15, she says she didn't really learn to accept the wheelchair fully. Getting into para sports at that time was important, she says. Para ice hockey is for those with a physical impairment in the lower part of the body. Players sit on sleds and use two sticks to power themselves across the ice, hit the puck and score goals. At the Winter Paralympics, it is loud and brash and hugely exciting for the spectators. Sirens go off when goals are scored, music booms across the arena every time a penalty is awarded and phrases like ""awesome save"" flash up on the jumbotron - a giant cubic screen in the centre of the arena. Schroeder trained hard with a team in Oslo and was called up to Team Norway in 2014. She was, and still is, the only woman on the squad, but she doesn't let that faze her. ""I'm so used to it, so I don't really think much about it. It's always fun playing with the guys and for me it's so natural. They're a bunch of great guys and I like to be in there with them."" Before November 2016, the sport was known under the more aggressive-sounding name sledge hockey before it was rebranded. Typically you'll see the players speed across the ice, crash into each other when trying to wrestle back control of the puck, topple over, or get pushed into the side barrier. ""My coach said that some opponents had been asking him if they should go easy on me because I'm a female. My coach was like, 'Well, that's your choice, but she will hit you back'."" Schroeder made it known from the beginning that no-one should treat her gently and, showing her commitment to the sport, says she has worked hard to build up her speed and strength in order to compete amongst the men. ""The coaches have been clear they wouldn't bring me if I wasn't good enough - I had to prove that I deserved it."" Off the ice there's banter among all of Team Norway, and Schroeder even shares the locker room. ""There's a lot of joking between the guys and me. It's nothing special with me being a girl and they give me privacy when I ask for it but other than that nothing's different. ""Sometimes they might be joking about ladies, but if they're in doubt that what they said has offended someone, they say, 'Is this OK?'. ""There's never been anything that's crossed a line."" The main battle of the sexes is over who gets to shower first. ""I shower alone, so they have some logistics with me showering either first or last. We try to mix it up because I hate waiting for them and they hate waiting for me."" Schroeder enjoys playing with the men but would like to see more women in the sport. In 1994 fellow Norwegian, Brit Mjaasund Oejen, competed at the Lillehammer Games, but close to a quarter of a century on, Schroeder remains the only woman among the 135 players registered to play para ice hockey in Pyeongchang. The 2018 Winter Paralympics saw a 44% increase in female athletes compared with Sochi in 2014, but ice hockey's expansion is slow and still remains a mixed sex sport. The US and Canada have national female teams but Europe has had to pool its talent to create a single women's squad, which Schroeder is part of. ""The goal is for every country to have their own national team and then hopefully [women's para ice hockey] becomes a Paralympic sport,"" she says. ""As long as there's mixed teams then too few girls will be able to play at this level because most teams don't give them that opportunity."" Schroeder isn't a full-time athlete. She also studies medicine and has to balance training and competitions with university in Oslo. But aged 25, she has time on her side. ""Right now I think it's really fun to be able to focus on hockey, but there's not really much money in para sports and I can't play hockey forever. I need a job in the future and I love medicine. ""I'm still so young that I have the privilege of just having the chance to put the studies on hold for just a while and then focus on hockey, it's no problem.""

"Mr McCabe has spent most of his career working at the FBI Former FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe has been sacked days before he could retire with pension rights. He was fired by US Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who said an internal review found he leaked information and misled investigators. Mr McCabe denied the claims and said he was being targeted because of his involvement in the inquiry into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 election. US media say he has kept notes of his interactions with the president. If so, they may become part of the inquiry. Mr Trump has long accused Mr McCabe of bias in favour of the Democrats.

In December, the president appeared to taunt the then number two at the FBI, when he tweeted:  ""FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe is racing the clock to retire with full benefits. 90 days to go?!!!"" Mr McCabe had been under an internal investigation into the FBI's handling of two key inquiries during the 2016 presidential campaign - the revelations thatHillary Clinton had used a private email server while secretary of stateandsuspicions that Russia was interfering to help Mr Trump win the presidency. He stepped down from his role as deputy director in January because of the review, and had remained on the FBI's books ahead of his expected retirement. His sacking came late on Friday night. Mr Sessions, who heads the justice department, said it was the result of ""an extensive and fair investigation"" by his department and the FBI. Mr Sessions has been under pressure to decide Mr McCabe's fate ahead of his retirement Mr Sessions said the report had concluded that Mr McCabe had ""made an unauthorised disclosure to the news media and lacked candour - including under oath - on multiple occasions"". Who's who in Russia-Trump inquiry? Trump Russia: Key questions answered What is Mueller's special counsel? The report has not been released but it is thought to refer to an interview Mr McCabe authorised between two FBI officials and a Wall Street Journal reporter in October 2016 to explain the agency's position in the Clinton emails inquiry. He was then subsequently interviewed by the justice department's inspector general. Mr McCabe has issued a lengthy statement vehemently rejecting the allegations against him,externaland denouncing what he described as a campaign of attacks on his credibility. He insisted he had done nothing wrong in organising the October 2016 interview, saying ""it was the type of exchange with the media that the Deputy Director oversees several times per week"". He said of the subsequent justice department investigation that he tried to answer the questions ""truthfully and accurately"" and ""when I thought my answers were misunderstood, I contacted investigators to correct them"". This video can not be played The former director's most revealing moments ""The big picture is a tale of what can happen when law enforcement is politicized,"" he went on to say. ""Here is the reality: I am being singled out and treated this way because of the role I played, the actions I took, and the events I witnessed in the aftermath of the firing of James Comey."" Mr Comey was fired as head of the FBI in May last year by the president,who cited his handling of the Clinton email investigation but later acknowledged ""this Russia thing"" was part of the reason. Mr Comey had been leading the FBI's investigation into allegations of collusion between Trump campaign officials and Russian interference in the vote. He later told a Senate hearing that the president had asked for his ""loyalty"". Mr McCabe alleges that the release of the justice department report recommending his firing was ""accelerated"" after he indicated that he would corroborate Mr Comey's version of events. Mr Trump has been a frequent critic of Mr McCabe, whom he accuses of political bias in his roles in the Russia and Clinton email investigations. He has publicly pointed to donations that Mr McCabe's wife Jill, a Democrat, received from a Clinton ally when she ran unsuccessfully for the state Senate in Virginia in 2015. The White House said it was for the attorney general, not President Trump, to fire Mr McCabe After James Comey was fired, Mr McCabe became acting director of the FBI.Mr Trump reportedly invited him to the Oval Office and asked him who he voted for in the 2016 election.,external Mr McCabe, in his statement on Friday, said he and his family had been the targets of an ""unrelenting assault"" in the media to undermine his reputation, and said Mr Trump's tweets had ""amplified and exacerbated it all"". Citing anonymous sources on Saturday, the Associated Press news agency says Mr McCabe has kept memos of his meetings with Mr Trump. It is not clear whether they have been handed over to the special counsel leading the inquiry, Robert Mueller. Mr Comey also kept contemporaneous notes of his encounters with Mr Trump. Trump 'asked McCabe how he voted' Republican memo accuses FBI of abusing power Trump renews attack on 'disgraceful' FBI Mr McCabe had been with the FBI for two decades and was due to retire on Sunday, the day he turns 50 and can claim his federal government pension. It is not clear how much of his pension he might lose as a result of Mr Sessions' announcement. White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders on Thursday said it was for the attorney general to decide Mr McCabe's future.

"Eric McKenna was cautioned following the dispute with his neighbour, but more serious consequences were to follow A rapist who evaded capture for more than 30 years until he urinated in a neighbour's plant pot - leading to a DNA match - has been jailed. Eric McKenna, 59, raped two women in separate attacks in the North East in 1983 and 1988. Police had not linked the assaults until they were called to the neighbour dispute in 2016 and took swabs from McKenna which matched the cold cases. McKenna, of Clarewood Court, Newcastle, has been jailed for 23 years. Newcastle Crown Court was told analysis of the DNA showed it to be an exact match for samples recovered after both rapes. McKenna attacked a 21-year-old woman as she walked home near the High Level Bridge in Gateshead in April 1983. Then, in March 1988, he targeted an 18-year-old student in the Manors area of Newcastle. He approached both victims from behind as they walked alone and threatened them with a knife. Det Con Mick Wilson, of Northumbria Police, described it as ""a very unusual case"" and said McKenna had ""failed to show a glimmer of remorse"". He added: ""His crimes were calculated, planned and were horrific experiences for the two victims involved. ""In the 1980s we did not have the same forensic techniques available that we do now and we have secured a conviction thanks to those developments. ""McKenna thought he had got away with his crimes, but a neighbourly dispute and a moment of stupidity has landed him in prison for 23 years."" The force apologised to the two women after admitting they did not receive the support they should have when they reported the attacks. Jackie Wilkinson, of the Crown Prosecution Service, said McKenna had ""evaded justice for two brutal rapes for over 30 years"" until an ""overwhelming case"" was built against him. She added: ""The attacks had pronounced and lasting effects on his victims throughout their lives and they have both spoken of their distress during the original investigations.

"Russian businessman Nikolai Glushkov was found dead at his home on March 12 UK police have launched a murder investigation after the death of Russian businessman Nikolai Glushkov in south-west London. Mr Glushkov was found dead at his homein New Malden on 12 March. A post-mortem examination revealed Mr Glushkov, who was 68, died from ""compression to the neck"". There is, at this stage, no evidence linking the death tothe attempted murder of a former Russian spy and his daughter in Salisbury, police say. Detectives are retaining an open mind and are appealing for any information that will assist the investigation. In particular, they are appealing for anyone who may have seen or heard anything suspicious at or near his home in Clarence Avenue, New Malden, between Sunday 11 March and Monday 12 March to contact them. Police on Friday continued to guard the home lived in by Mr Glushkov. A blue and a purple tent was erected to cover the front drive of the property, which has been cordoned off along with several adjoining properties either side. Mr Glushkov is the former deputy director of Russian state airline Aeroflot. He was jailed in 1999 for five years after being charged with money laundering and fraud. Profile: Who was Russian businessman Nikolai Glushkov? Counter-terror police investigate 'unexplained' death Russia spy poisoning: Rudd says inquiry widened to other deaths Sergei Skripal and the 14 deaths under scrutiny Vladimir Putin most likely behind Salisbury attack, says Boris Johnson After being given a suspended sentence for another count of fraud in 2006, he was granted political asylum in the UK in 2010 and became a critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin. Former PR and advertising executive Lord Bell, who was a close friend of Mr Glushkov, described him as a ""very charming, funny, affectionate man who had a troubled past"". He said he was ""concerned"" his friend's past might have made Russia consider him to have worked against the state. Kate Fitzsimmons, an 87-year-old neighbour of Mr Glushkov, said he was ""just an ordinary friendly Englishman"" who would wave at her across the road. She said his death and the subsequent police activity was a ""big shock"". Mr Glushkov had a close friendship with fellow Russian businessman Boris Berezovsky, who came to the UK in 1999 after falling out with Mr Putin. Detectives are appealing for witnesses who were in the New Malden area on 11 March and 12 March Mr Berezovsky was found hanged in the bathroom of his Berkshire home in 2013 and an inquest recorded an open verdict. Meanwhile, Russia's investigative committee has said it has opened a criminal case investigation into ""the murder"" of Mr Glushkov and the ""attempted murder"" of Yulia Skripal. Ms Skripal and her father, the former Russian spy Sergei Skripal, were found unconscious on a bench in Salisbury earlier this month after being exposed to a nerve agent. The UK government says the Skripals were poisoned with a nerve agent of a type developed by Russia called Novichok, and Prime Minister Theresa May said she believed Moscow was ""culpable"". Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson added it was ""overwhelmingly likely"" that Mr Putin personally ordered the nerve agent attack in Salisbury. Analysis By BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw What is significant about this case is that counter-terrorism police are investigating this murder - normally it would be done by a homicide team. Scotland Yard says that is being done as a precaution because of his associations - he was a friend of Mr Berezovsky, who died in slightly mysterious circumstances, and Mr Glushkov said before he died he not believe his friend's death was a suicide. He was also wanted by the Russian Federation. He was on a list of people the British had refused to extradite. In Russia, he was facing charges including large-scale fraud and embezzling money relating to Aeroflot. Speaking during a visit to a west London military museum with the Polish foreign minister, Mr Johnson said the UK's ""quarrel is with Putin's Kremlin"". ""We think it overwhelmingly likely that it was his decision to direct the use of a nerve agent on the streets of the UK, on the streets of Europe, for the first time since the Second World War,"" he said. Mr Glushkov's death comes in the same week as Home Secretary Amber Rudd announced that a string of deaths on UK soil are to be reinvestigated by the police and MI5 after claims of Russian involvement. BuzzFeed News claimed to have evidence,externalof 14 deaths that were actually murders by the Russian state or mafia allies. In each of the cases, police investigations and inquests did not find evidence of any crime.

"UK police have begun to contact a number of Russian exiles to discuss their safety as they investigate the murder of businessman Nikolai Glushkov. The 68-year-old's body was discovered at his south-London home on 12 March. A post-mortem examination has found he died from ""compression to the neck"". The UK granted Mr Glushkov political asylum in 2010 after he fled Moscow. The BBC has been told police and the security services have reassessed their view that other exiles are at low risk. Police say there is no evidence at this stage linking Mr Glushkov's death to thepoisoning of former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia, in Salisbury on 4 March. It comes asRussia said it would expel 23 British diplomatsamid tensions with the UK over the incident. Nikolai Glushkov had been living in the UK since 2010 The Metropolitan Police launched a murder investigation on Friday after post-mortem results indicated Mr Glushkov had died from ""compression to the neck"".

"This video can not be played Amber Rudd speaking after a Cobra meeting. A string of deaths on UK soilare to be reinvestigated by the police and MI5 after claims of Russian involvement, Home Secretary Amber Rudd says. BuzzFeed News claimed to have evidence,externalof 14 deaths that were actually murders by the Russian state or mafia allies. In each of the cases, police investigations and inquests did not find evidence of any crime. Russia has denied being involved inthe poisoning of former spy Sergei Skripal and his daughterlast week. The deaths that Buzzfeed identified include those of Boris Berezovsky, an outspoken critic of the Kremlin and a friend of Alexander Litvinenko - whose death from radiation poisoning caused a long-running diplomatic spat between the UK and Russia - and whistle-blower Alexander Perepilichnyy. Mr Perepilichnyy died while jogging in 2012. Police said they found no evidence he was poisoned. An inquest into his death resumes in April. Despite Ms Rudd's statement, Surrey Police said it would not be reopening the investigation into Mr Perepilichnyy's death. Mr Berezovsky was found hanged in his bathroom in 2013. Police said a post-mortem showed no sign of a violent struggle. BuzzFeed News reported that US intelligence sources believe these deaths were two of 14 assassinations linked to Russia. Boris Berezovsky was found dead in 2013. In a letter to MPs, Ms Rudd said the government ""takes seriously any suggestion that a foreign state has engaged in murder on UK soil"". Yvette Cooper, Labour MP and chairwoman of the home affairs select committee, had written to Ms Rudd last week asking for the investigations to be reopened. She welcomed the decision to do so, saying: ""Given the gravity of these issues, it is... right that the authorities should reassure us that they have looked at any further allegations or relevant evidence put forward in any other cases."" She added: ""The government must satisfy itself that the correct finding was reached in each case and the public need to know that relevant questions about wider Russia links have been investigated and answered.""

"From a strictly action-hero point of view, Alicia Vikander's 2018 incarnation of Lara Croft is about as similar to Angelina Jolie's 2001 original as Postman Pat is to The Terminator. While Jolie's gun-toting, high-status Lara opened her movie by annihilating a multi-armed robot while throwing the sort of kung-fu moves that made Bruce Lee look arthritic, Vikander's begins with her working out in the local gym followed by a rather dull catch-me-if-you-can bicycle game around the not-very-mean streets of London. Which is not to say the 2018 Tomb Raider reboot is worse than version 2.001. That would be nigh on impossible. It's just a different proposition. Less a high-concept video game reimagined for the big screen, more a Gregory's Girl spin-off with the tiniest hint of Shakespeare's The Tempest. Today's Lara is in her early 20s, broke and scraping a living in London as a bicycle courier. That's her choice. She could be as rich as Croesus having inherited her father's multi-national business if only she'd sign his death certificate. But she won't because that would be accepting the unacceptable and acknowledging her dad's demise after he took a mysterious trip seven years earlier, from which he promised to return but didn't. We know more. We know he had set off on a treacherous journey to the East to find the lost island of Yamiti in the middle of the perilous Devil's Sea, where he hoped to discover the tomb of Himiko, the first queen of Japan who spread ""death and destruction with just the touch of her hand"". He, Richard Croft (Dominic West), had to get there first before some malicious baddie (played by a toothy Walton Goggins in this instance) beat him to it and released the dark powers of the ""Death Queen"" and thereby wreaking havoc on the world. Honestly, a shaggy dog story has a quicker set-up than this movie. By the time Vikander's unarmed Lara actually starts to mix it with nasty types in her quest to find her father and Himiko's grave, Angelina Jolie would have pulverised countless people, blown up dozens of cars, crashed numerous motorbikes, and destroyed at least a couple of buildings. Rule one of an action movie is action. And lots of it. That's the point. You can still have your human-interest sub-plots, but don't let them get in the way of the Action. Daniel Wu plays Lara Croft's seafaring enabler Lu Ren Black Panther is the new gold standard in this regard, mixing pop culture comic book mayhem with razor-sharp scriptwriting. This timid version of Lara Croft actually feels old-fashioned. More like a prequel to the original, a film more akin to an early Indiana Jones from last century than a modern day blockbuster franchise. Maybe it has been miscast in the action adventure genre? Perhaps this Tomb Raider, with a low-tech, sensitive Lara, belongs in the family drama category. Any which way, the script isn't great although Alicia Vikander still manages to turn in a decent performance, as does Daniel Wu as her seafaring enabler, Lu Ren. Dominic West is always a pleasure to watch but he is a little let down by a character who is, shall we say, not the most exciting adventurer ever to set foot on uncharted soil. Kristen Scott-Thomas and Derek Jacobi make cameo appearances The cameos from Derek Jacobi and Kristen Scott-Thomas as stewards of the Croft empire are fine as far as they go, which is not very far, but could be seeds planted for further stories should the franchise live beyond this outing. Whether it does or not will probably be down to how it does at the box office, which is a dangerous place right now with Black Panther still on the prowlâ¦ Read more reviews from Will Follow Will Gompertz on Twitter,external Listen to this week's episode of Will's Arts Club podcast Tomb Raider poster gets it in the neck Tomb Raider star: 'It's all very positive' Video, 00:01:38Tomb Raider star: 'It's all very positive' Death toll rises amid most destructive wildfire in Los Angeles' history Moment friends abandon house as Palisades fire closes in 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Why does Trump want Greenland and what do its people think?

"Ian Khama says that US policy is encouraging poaching of endangered animals The outgoing president of Botswana has attacked his US counterpart Donald Trump for ""encouraging poaching"" by overturning a ban on the import of hunting trophies. Speaking at an anti-poaching summit in Botswana, two weeks before he steps down, President Ian Khama told the BBC it was not just Mr Trump's attitude towards wildlife he was concerned about, but his ""attitude towards the whole planet"". The US government recently made a U-turn on the import of animal heads from Africa - the ""trophies"" prized by American hunters travelling to the continent. Mr Khama said that his government had ""actually banned hunting"" but that Mr Trump's lifting of the trophy ban was ""encouraging poaching in this country"". This video can not be played Counting Africa's elephants from the air Mr Khama was speaking at the Giant's Club Summit in Kasane, which is discussing efforts to tackle the poaching epidemic which is killing tens of thousands of elephants every year. Although the number of animals being poached for ivory has been dropping over the past few years, more elephants are being killed for their tusks than are being born, leaving them in danger. ""We haven't passed the worst of the poaching crisis,"" said Mike Chase, director and founder of Elephants Without Borders. ""The political will to address these issues is unfortunately not there. It has been in Botswana, and if our neighbours can learn from Botswana's example I feel we can address this poaching crisis."" The war on elephants 'Elephant refugee' problem in Africa The summit is showcasing ways of improving anti-poaching measures, borrowing from counter-terrorism. ""The focus now is on intelligence-led patrol work, intelligence-led investigations,"" said Kevin Vallack, a former British policeman and intelligence officer, now with the conservation group Space for Giants. ""So the same principles apply as in counter-terrorism and organised crime - countering terrorists, traffickersâ¦ and wildlife poachers."" Preventing human-wildlife conflict, and helping elephants have more value to communities alive than dead are key areas of discussion, but many conservationists believe a total ban on ivory trade is the only way to save the elephants. Fitting a tracker to monitor elephant movements can help prevent human-wildlife conflict The EU, and the UK specifically, are the biggest exporters of legal ivory - much of it labelled as antique - and three African presidents have now put their name to a million-signature global petition asking for a ban on this legal trade in ivory. President Khama praised China for implementing a ban on their domestic ivory trade earlier this year, and called on Britain and the EU to do likewise. ""When you look at the other countries coming on board - for example China - I think they are setting a wonderful example to follow, whether it's the UK or the European Union."" The UK Minister for Africa, Harriett Baldwin, who is attending the summit said: ""Our aim is to ban antique ivory sales in the UK this year."" ""People in the UK really care passionately about this issue and they want to make sure we save these magnificent elephants in the wild for future generations,"" she said. A consultation period on how the UK should implement any ban, and what the exceptions might be, ended recently, and an announcement on the new government policy is expected in the coming weeks.
