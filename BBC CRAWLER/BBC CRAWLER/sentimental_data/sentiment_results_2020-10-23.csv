"The president of the United States is not just the leader of his country, he is probably the most powerful person on Earth. What he does changes life for all of us. Donald Trump is no exception. So how exactly has Mr Trump changed the world? President Trump has repeatedly declared the US ""the greatest country in the world"". But according toa recent 13-nation poll,externalby the Pew Research Center, he hasn't done much for its image overseas. In many European countries, the percentage of the public with a positive view of America is at its lowest for almost 20 years. In the UK, 41% had a favourable opinion, while in France it was 31%, the lowest since 2003, and in Germany just 26%. America's response to the coronavirus pandemic was a major factor - only 15% of respondents felt the US had handled the virus well, according to figures from July and August. It's hard to pin down what President Trump believes about climate change, as he's called it everything from ""an expensive hoax"", to a ""serious subject"" that is ""very important to me"". What is clear is that six months into the job, he dismayed scientists byannouncing America's withdrawal from the Paris climate accord, which committed nearly 200 countries to keeping global temperature rises well under 2C. The US is the second-biggest emitter of greenhouse gases behind China, and researchers have warned that if Mr Trump is re-elected, it may become impossible to keep global warming in check. Rejecting the Paris agreement, the president claimed it ""would have been shutting down American producers with excessive regulatory restrictions"". This has been a theme for Mr Trump, who hasremoved a raft of pollution regulations,externalto cut the cost of producing coal, oil and gas. A simple guide to the US election How is Donald Trump doing in the polls? Who will be the next US president? You decide Where Trump and Biden stand on guns, race and climate Full coverage of the US election Several US coal mines have still closed, however, driven by competition from cheaper natural gas and state efforts to support renewable energy. Government figures showrenewable sources generated more energy than coal in the US in 2019,external, for the first time in more than 130 years. America's exit from the Paris climate deal formally takes effect on 4 November, the day after the presidential election. Joe Biden has pledged to rejoin the pact if he wins. Fears that the US pull-out would prompt a domino effect have not been realised, although some observers believe it smoothed the path for Brazil and Saudi Arabia to block progress on cutting carbon emissions. What US election results will mean for climate change President Trump set out his stall on immigration just a week after his inauguration, closing US borders to travellers from seven Muslim-majority countries. Currently 13 nations are subject to tight travel restrictions. The number of foreign-born people living in the US was about 3% higher in 2019 than in 2016, President Obama's last year in office. But who those immigrants are has changed. The percentage of US residents born in Mexico has fallen steadily during Mr Trump's term, while the number who moved from elsewhere in Latin America and the Caribbean has increased. There has also been a general tightening of the number of visas enabling people to settle permanently in the US - particularly for relatives of those already living there. If there's an emblem of President Trump's immigration policy, it's surely the ""big, beautiful wall"" he swore to build on the border with Mexico. As of 19 October, US Customs and Border Protection says 371 miles of wall have been constructed - almost all of it replacement fencing where barriers already existed. The work did not deter those desperate to reach America. The number of migrants detained at the US-Mexico border hit its highest level for 12 years in 2019, spurred by a peak in arrivals during the spring. More than half were families, mostly from Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador, where violence and poverty are driving people to seek asylum and a new life elsewhere. Did Trump stop more people coming to the US? Turning to refugees, Donald Trump has made swingeing cuts to the number who can resettle in America. The US took in almost 85,000 refugees in the fiscal year 2016, which fell to under 54,000 people the following year. In 2021, the maximum will be 15,000 people - the fewest since the refugee programme launched in 1980. ""I think one of the greatest of all terms I've come up with is 'fake',""Donald Trump said in an October 2017 interview,external. Although the president definitely didn't invent the term ""fake news"", it's fair to say he popularised it. According to social media posts and audio transcripts monitored by Factba.se, he has used the phrase about 2,000 times since first tweeting it in December 2016. Allow Twitter content?

Charted over time, you can see how US interest rose in the winter of 2016-17, and spiked the week the president unveiled what he called the ""Fake News Awards"", a list of news stories he viewed as false. During the 2016 White House race, ""fake news"" meant untrue reports like one about Pope Francis endorsing Mr Trump for the presidency. But as it seeped into popular usage, that meaning shifted away from being just about misinformation. The president has frequently used ""fake news"" to attack news stories he disagrees with. In February 2017, he took it further, branding several news outlets ""the enemy of the American people"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

It's a term that's been picked up by leaders in Thailand, the Philippines, Saudi Arabia and Bahrain, among others, and some have used allegations of spreading ""fake news"" to justify repression and prosecutions against opposition activists and journalists. Civil society groups say that by using the term against credible reporting, politicians fundamentally undermine democracy, which relies on people agreeing what the basic facts are. The (almost) complete history of 'fake news' In his February 2019 State of the Union address, President Trump pledged to withdraw US troops from Syria, declaring: ""Great nations do not fight endless wars."" The numbers paint a more nuanced story. Not least because months down the line, Mr Trump decided to keep about 500 troops in Syria after all to protect oil wells. The president has scaled back the presence he inherited in Afghanistan, and to an extent in Iraq and Syria. But American forces are still everywhere they were the day he took office. There are ways to impact on the Middle East without troops, of course. President Trump overturned the objections of previous presidents by moving the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem in 2018, and recognising the city, including its occupied East, as Israel's capital. Last month he hailed the ""dawn of a new Middle East"" when the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain signed agreements normalising relations with Israel - a move the US helped broker. Rhetoric aside, this was perhaps the most significant diplomatic achievement of the Trump administration. The two Gulf states are just the third and fourth Arab nations in the Middle East to recognise Israel since it declared independence in 1948. President Trump seems to scorn deals he didn't broker. On his first day in office, he dumped the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a 12-nation trade deal approved by President Obama, after branding it ""horrible"". The withdrawal mostly benefited China, which viewed the deal as an attempt to curb its influence in the Asia-Pacific region. But in the US, critics who felt the agreement would compromise American jobs cheered its demise. Mr Trump also renegotiated the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico, which he called ""perhaps the worst trade deal ever made"". Its replacement left much unchanged, but toughened up labour provisions and rules on the sourcing of car parts. The president's real fixation has been how America benefits from trade with the world. The outcome was a bitter trade war with China, in which the world's two largest economies imposed hundreds of billions of dollars of taxes on each other's goods. It's been a headache for US soybean farmers and the tech and auto industries. China was affected too, as businesses moved their manufacturing to countries like Vietnam and Cambodia to lower their costs. For 2019, the US trade deficit in goods with China was slightly under its 2016 level. American companies imported less as they sought to avoid Mr Trump's tariffs. However, despite the coronavirus pandemic heavily influencing trends for 2020.America still imports more goods than it exports,external. This Trump tweet refers to a policy rollback so stunning that the phone call in question has its own Wikipedia page. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

On 2 December 2016, Mr Trump (then president-elect) took the highly unusual step of speaking directly to the president of Taiwan - breaking with a precedent set in 1979, when formal relations were cut. Carrie Gracie, then the BBC's China editor, predicted the move would prompt ""alarm and anger"" in Beijing, which sees Taiwan as a province of China not an independent state. The bold opener from Mr Trump was the first in a multi-pronged poking contest between the great geopolitical rivals, which has sunk relations to their lowest point in years. The US has irked China by declaring its territorial claims in the South China Sea illegal, heaping tariffs on its goods, banning downloads of the popular apps TikTok and WeChat, and blacklisting Chinese telecoms giant Huawei - which it claims is a threat to national security. But the tensions did not begin under Mr Trump, and are driven in part by China's own actions. President Xi Jinping, in power since 2013, has presided over a highly controversial national security law in Hong Kong, and the mass imprisonment of China's Muslim minority Uighurs. Who does China really want to win US election? President Trump has renamed Covid-19 ""the China virus"", and while he may be keen to deflect scrutiny from his own handling of the pandemic, a change of US leadership wouldn't necessarily mean a more conciliatory tone. Democratic nominee Joe Biden has called President Xi a thug, and claimed the Chinese leader ""doesn't have a [democratic] bone in his body"". ""Iran will be held fully responsible for lives lost, or damage incurred, at any of our facilities. They will pay a very BIG PRICE! This is not a Warning, it is a Threat,"" Mr Trump tweeted on New Year's Eve, 2019. ""Happy New Year!"" Days later, to global shock, the US assassinated Qasem Suleimani, Iran's most powerful general, and the man who spearheaded its military operations in the Middle East. Iran retaliated, firing more than a dozen ballistic missiles at two American bases in Iraq. More than 100 US troops were injured, and analysts deemed the nations on the brink of war. There was no war, but innocent civilians still died: just hours after Iran's missile strikes, its military mistakenly shot down a Ukrainian passenger jet, killing all 176 people on board. How did it come to this? A series of mutual miscalculations made against a backdrop of mistrust. The US and Iran have been at loggerheads since 1979, when Iran's US-backed shah (its monarch) was overthrown, and 52 Americans were taken hostage inside the US embassy. In May 2018, Mr Trump ratcheted up tensions by abandoning a 2015 nuclear deal, under which Iran agreed to limit its nuclear programme in return for the lifting of economic sanctions. He then put in place what the White House called ""the toughest sanctions regime ever imposed"" - designed to compel Iran's leaders into a deal more to his liking. Tehran refused to bend. The sanctions drove Iran's economy into severe recession, and by October 2019 the cost of food was up by 61% year-on-year and the price of tobacco by 80%. Suffering Iranians held widespread protests a month later. While the coronavirus crisis has absorbed political attention in both hard-hit countries, their diplomatic channels remain few and their flashpoints numerous.

"One council leader described some MPs as ""callously indifferent"" to the plight of children Communities across the country are stepping up to the plate to provide free school meals to children after a campaign by Marcus Rashford. It comes after a motion to extend free school meals over holidays during the Covid-19 pandemic was rejected by MPs. The Manchester United striker had called on people to ""unite"" to protect the most vulnerable children. Fish and chip shops, pubs, restaurants and cafes areamong the hospitality venues to offer free meals. A growing number of councils across Englandhave also pledged to provide food vouchers over half term. Labour-led authorities in Birmingham, Liverpool, Sheffield, Hammersmith & Fulham and Doncaster are among those agreeing to fund their own schemes. This video can not be played Marcus Rashford and his mother Melanie helped out at FareShare Greater Manchester The government said all measures would be kept under review after a Labour motion in the Commons to extend the scheme over holidays until Easter 2021 was defeated. Hammersmith & Fulham Council leader Stephen Cowan said watching the vote was ""cutting"". He said: ""I have seen a lot of kids who need food. I was in a school on Tuesday speaking to kids who have the free lunches now and they were explaining they have gone for days without a proper meal. ""They were very sweet kids, and then I looked at the MPs who were so callously indifferent to that and I thought, 'how can that be happening in the fifth richest country on Earth?' ""There are so many things they spend money on, it's a moral imperative."" Liverpool mayor Joe Anderson said the decision would feed about 19,800 children in the city, while Doncaster's mayor Ros Jonessaid it was ""the right thing to do"". Restaurants rally for Rashford's free meal crusade Councils promise free meals after Rashford campaign Tory MPs attack celebrity school meal campaigners Ian Ward, leader of Birmingham City Council, the largest local authority in England, described the government policy on the issue as ""chaotic"" and ""unsustainable"". Government ministers have praised Mr Rashford for highlighting the difficulties facing low-income families, but some Conservative MPs have accused him of ""virtue signalling"". More than 200 children's writersare among those urging the government to ensure no child goes hungry this winter. Other councils who have offered their own meal schemes include York, Wolverhampton, Oldham, Southwark, Redbridge, Lambeth, North Tyneside, Greenwich, Tower Hamlets and Telford & Wrekin. Marcus Rashford has urged people to ""unite"" to protect the most vulnerable children Other areas that will provide support include Reading, Middlesbrough, Medway, Kirklees, Brighton, Sefton, Knowsley, Lewisham, Halton and Portsmouth. Treasury minister Steve Barclay told BBC Radio 4's Today earlier there was an extra Â£9bn in support available through the welfare system. ""It's important we support families in need,"" he said. ""In the design and the measures we've taken, for example on housing support, lifting the allowance at the lowest in terms of rents to cover a much wider range of housing benefits, that again is about supporting families through the welfare system.""

He describes trying to help junior members of staff survive long and difficult days. ""And I'd see these eyes as big as saucers saying help me, do something. Make this right. Fix this."" ""The pressure was insane, and the anxiety just got me,"" he says. ""I couldn't sleep, and I couldn't eat, I was sick before work, I was shaking before I got into my car in the morning."" Nathan ended up having time off with severe anxiety, but he is now back at the hospital, waiting for the beds to fill up again. We've spoken to a number of nurses and doctors across the UK who are deeply apprehensive about what lies ahead this winter. We're not using their real names because they shared their views on condition of anonymity, in order to speak freely. All believe it is important that the general public hears first-hand about the enormous strain the health service and its staff have been under. It has not just been about coping with the devastating effects of a new and deadly disease. Pressure to deal with the huge backlog of other medical treatments, which had been put on hold, meant some health care workers didn't have much of a break during the summer either. ""I finally went on holiday in September and it was like I came out of a fog,"" says Danny, an intensive care doctor and anaesthetist based in Yorkshire. ""Almost the last six months of my life was just some kind of haze that I don't remember very well. You just became all about Covid and nothing else,"" he says. ""And I think that got us through the first wave, but obviously it isn't a sustainable mechanism to carry on."" That widely shared feeling of exhaustion has been heightened by long-standing concerns about staff shortages, and by deep resentment - particularly among nurses - about pay and conditions. One of the lasting images of the first wave of Covid is of the weekly ""clap for carers"" - that moment of national unity that took place on doorsteps at 20:00 every Thursday night. Health care workers have been very appreciative of public support, but many say they would prefer a proper pay settlement to another round of applause. And Jo Billings, a psychologist from theCovid Trauma Response Working Group at University College London,external, says ""the narrative of health care workers being heroes or angels has largely been really unhelpful."" It painted a picture that people do this because they're special, not because they're simply doing their job, for which they should be adequately paid and protected. ""It's also been a real barrier to people seeking help with their own problems,"" Dr Billings says, ""because they feel heroes don't struggle. An angel doesn't get PTSD."" The first wave of Covid-19 could have been much worse than it was. In fact, many doctors expected it to be. A lot of the extra capacity that was created so quickly in the health system, in temporary Nightingale hospitals and elsewhere, was not needed. But health care staff speak of an ""all hands on deck"" mentality, when people were doing long shifts and were often away from home for extended periods to protect their families. ""It was mentally draining, and we've not really had a proper downtime,"" says Moussa, a respiratory consultant from Greater Manchester. ""As soon as the first wave finished, we started catching up with the backlog of other cases. So, there was another mountain to climb."" That sense of fatigue and frustration, in a health service already stretched to the limit before Covid struck, is captured in data put together by the Covid Trauma Response Working Group. Its Frontline Covid study of nearly 1200 health care workers from across the UK between May and July found that nearly 60% of them met the criteria for at least one of three things - anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. Various risk factors were identified, including fear of transmitting Covid to others, unreliable access to Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) at the time, feeling stigmatised due to their role, and not feeling able to talk to a manager about how they were coping. Conversations with NHS staff reveal a system of support for staff welfare and mental health which is patchy - fantastic in some places, not so in others. ""A junior doctor I spoke to the other day was talking about what a difficult time she'd found in another hospital,"" says Dorothy Wade, a psychologist at University College Hospital in London. ""And I said, 'Didn't you have anything like this at the other hospital?' And she said, 'No, absolutely nothing. There was nothing on offer at all.' She says quite a lot of hospitals still don't have a staff psychologist, and didn't have resources to offer any provisions. It has been a similar story in intensive care units, says Nicki Credland of the British Association of Critical Care Nurses. ""In some places there have been significant amounts of psychological support,"" but in others ""staff are reporting that they're needing to go to their GP."" NHS England says nearly half a million staff were given extra support with their health and mental wellbeing needs during the first wave, via self-help apps, text services, online forums and telephone helplines. But in most cases, it is down to local management, and sometimes support isn't available at the time that shift workers need it. ""Members of staff in our ward have been permanently scarred by Covid,"" says Jacqui, a nurse at a small community hospital in London. ""They sometimes struggle now doing some of the more minor tasks. [But] we were very lucky that we're in a very good, small trust,"" she says, ""which has taken all that on board and is supporting them."" A large number of health care workers, however, were redeployed into new hospitals or new wards, or even into entirely new areas with very little training and very little preparation. And the Frontline Covid survey reveals that many of them were distressed by what they saw. That is partly because even at the best of times in critical care, a lot of patients are going to die. ""You have to have this slight disconnect with what's going on because you have to accept that you can do everything right, and the patient still might not survive,"" says Danny, the ICU doctor in Yorkshire. ""But people coming from elsewhere in the hospital haven't had the time to develop that kind of mentality."" In Northern Ireland, Gemma was asked recently by her manager if she would like to volunteer to go back into an ICU. ""I laughed in her face and said no,"" she admits. ""I don't know if I'll be made to go. But as soon as you walk over the threshold of a hospital, you cannot refuse to look after a patient. And the thought is, you've done it before, you can do it again."" There's little doubt that morale in the NHS would be higher if staff felt they were being rewarded more fairly. The Royal College of Nursing (RCN)surveyed more than 40,000 of its members,externalin the aftermath of the first Covid wave, and found that pay, and feeling under-valued, was their number-one concern. ""It may feel like now is not the time to talk about pay, with so many people in lockdown and in serious financial difficulty,"" says Mike Adams of the RCN, ""but we've thought about this very carefully. ""If you want to do one thing for nurses who need a boost to get through the rest of this year, and through the winter, it would be to show you value them with a meaningful pay rise."" Many staff are frustrated because they know that is unlikely to happen. Nearly three quarters of respondents to the RCN survey said they thought they were more valued by the general public after the onset of Covid-19. But less than one fifth thought they were more valued by the government in their part of the UK. ""All that clapping, and all that goodwill,"" says Nathan, ""and now it's back to normal."" Doctors earn more money than nurses, but express similar sentiments. ""We've lost 40% of our pension pot in the last five years,"" says Jack, a consultant in London. ""And everyone is looking at it and wondering whether they should get out now before we lose any more. ""I think by next March, it's going to be a great deal worse,"" he says That in turn highlights another message delivered by members of the RCN. In the aftermath of the first Covid wave, 35% of more than 40,000 people said they were actively considering leaving the profession. An NHS spokesperson told the BBC that there are now more than 300,000 nurses in England, including  13,000 who joined recently. ""And this year there was a 22% increase in applications for nursing degrees, on top of our Â£28m fund to boost international recruitment,"" the spokesperson continued. It takes years to train new recruits, however, and there were more than 40,000 nursing vacancies across the NHS at the beginning of the year. Now, with Covid an ever-present danger, many experienced members of staff are thinking of leaving, and many of them are not coming back. THREE TIERS:How will the system work? SOCIAL DISTANCING:Can I give my friends a hug? PAY-PACKET SUPPORT:What will I be paid under the new scheme? SUPPORT BUBBLES:What are they and who can be in yours? FACE MASKS:When do I need to wear one? ""Nurses approaching retirement used to - in significant numbers - retire, and then return on a smaller number of hours,"" says Mike Adams at the RCN.  ""But that is just not happening as much. We're losing the guides and mentors for the student nurses and the newly qualified nurses."" Gemma in Northern Ireland says she plans to leave the NHS when this next Covid phase is over, and get a job in the private sector where she won't be redeployed at a moment's notice. ""A lot of what got us through is the camaraderie, informal chats in the tearoom,"" she explains. ""But we're not even allowed to chat in the tearoom anymore. We have to sit apart with masks on. ""I'd say a large proportion of my team feel the same. A couple of nurses have just taken early retirement saying, 'No, not doing it anymore.'"" Many people in the NHS think the public aren't always aware of how acute staff shortages could become. ""The focus during the first wave was all on ventilators and the Nightingales and beds and things like that,"" says Danny in Yorkshire. ""But the actual thing we need is staff."" He highlights a concern raised by a number of NHS staff that we talked to - an awful lot of people were so burnt out by the first wave that they may not be able to commit so much this time. Staffing up of ICU became a focus in the early months of the pandemic ""We've noticed there's a real reluctance among doctors, nurses, everyone to pick up these extra shifts now,"" he says. ""People are realising the importance of family, the pandemic has encouraged everyone to make life simpler, and they want to do something more sustainable second time around."" The challenge could be particularly acute in intensive care. In south-west London, Jacqui worked in an ICU during the first wave, and has the rights skills and experience. But she doesn't think she can do it again. ""Intensive care is incredibly physical, and I hurt my shoulder last time trying to roll a patient over,"" she says. ""Psychologically, I'm not sure I could completely cope with it again."" ""It has actually made me go, 'Right, next year, I really will take my pension, I won't work full time anymore.' I've done my bit."" Back in March and April, staff were redeployed in large numbers from other parts of the health system, particularly from operating theatres, to bolster intensive care. But if the government wants things like elective surgery and operations elsewhere in the health system to continue, many of those extra staff may not be available. ""We haven't miraculously managed to find an extra 10,000 ICU nurses over the past five months,"" says Nicki Credland. ""That gives us a problem, which is compounded by staff that are off sick because of the psychological and physical response to the first wave of Covid."" There are potential solutions to ease serious staff shortages if the virus strikes specific areas hard. Seriously-ill patients could be moved to hospitals under less pressure, or experienced staff, based in areas where the virus is spreading more slowly, could be moved into hotspots. ""We're taking a much more local approach,"" the medical director of NHS England Stephen Powis said last week, ""and we are determined to keep the capacity for non-Covid services open for as long as possible. ""That involves hospitals helping each other, the use of independent sector hospitals where we can, and it might involve some of the Nightingale hospitals."" A doctor at an NHS trust near Liverpool - which is in tier three - confirmed that her hospital was on standby to take patients from Liverpool City Region, even though its ICU was already full. Ambulances stand by in Strasbourg in March to load patients with Covid-19 into a medicalised train But if the pandemic gets a lot worse, the effectiveness of local cooperation like this could be limited. And there is no national plan for moving people or resources around the country. ""In France, they reconditioned trains and made carriages into mobile intensive care units,"" says Jack, the consultant in London. ""In Holland, they had a big double-decker bus, a mobile ICU to move large numbers around. But I'm not aware that we've got anything other than fleets of ambulances."" When you look back to March, there is no doubt some things have changed for the better. There is far more testing of NHS staff, including testing staff without symptoms in hotspot areas, and there is far less anxiety about the supply of personal protective equipment. Doctors also know more about the disease and ways to try to treat it, which should have a positive effect on staff morale. ""We still don't have a cure, but seeing people get better obviously makes staff stronger psychologically,"" says consultant Jack. ""We're only human after all."" Even so, a long winter looms. ""We will put our best foot forward, and we'll do the best for the patients,"" says Nathan, the ICU nurse in the Midlands, ""but I can genuinely say all of my colleagues, including senior management, are terrified."" ""We're not sure how, in terms of resilience, we are going to be able to get through this."" Across the NHS you can hear similar concerns - a determination to step up to the plate again, but also the knowledge that adrenalin only gets you so far. The desire to continue with business as usual in the NHS - treating other conditions and diseases as normal - is a laudable, and probably an essential, aim. But that may not prove possible - some hospitals are cancelling operations already. ""The pressure to still run all the normal functions of the NHS and deal with a Covid second wave that's got the potential to be bigger than the first one,"" says Moussa, ""that's a harsh, harsh thing when we feel we need to prioritise."" Many doctors were expecting a second wave to start around November, so it has come in some places a little earlier than predicted. And even in a normal year, the onset of winter and the flu season puts huge additional capacity pressure on the NHS. The government argues that the system has shown extraordinary resilience in the face of a pandemic unprecedented in living memory. But Moussa argues that as a country, ""we could have done more to be ready for the second wave"". ""When you think about it,"" he says, ""it's a bit of a perfect storm.""

"This video can not be played Covid in Scotland: What is the five-tier lockdown system? Scotland is to enter a new five-level system of coronavirus restrictions, Nicola Sturgeon has confirmed. The new model will come into force from 2 November, when temporary curbs on the hospitality trade are due to expire. It features five tiers of measures - from ""level zero"" to four - to be applied in different areas of Scotland depending on the spread of the virus. The top level would be close to a full lockdown, but the aim is for schools to remain open at all levels. Restrictions under levels two and three are similar to those which are currently in place for different parts of Scotland. The first minister saidthe new strategy,externalwas about ""striking the best balances we can"" between suppressing the virus and minimising wider harms to businesses and individuals. All you need to know about the UK's new Covid rules How will Scotland's new system work? Coronavirus infections continue to rise across UK Live: Latest on coronavirus in Scotland The move in Scotland comes as tougher restrictions are brought into force formillions of people in England and Wales. Coronavirus cases in Scotland continue to rise, with 1,401 registered on Friday alongside a further 18 deaths. The latest figures from the Office for National Statistics suggestthe virus is spreading across the UK, with 1 in every 180 people in Scotland thought to have been infected in the two weeks to 16 October. Ms Sturgeon said the ban on home visits and the short-term restrictions currently imposed on bars and restaurants in the central belt of the country in particular were beginning to slow the increase in cases. However, she said restrictions would still be needed until a vaccine for the virus was developed, adding: ""Everything we do must be consistent with suppressing Covid as far as we can."" The first minister said there would be talks with opposition parties and representatives of businesses - particularly from the hospitality trade - about the exact details of the different levels. Decisions on which tier each part of Scotland will be placed in will be made alongside local health protection teams in the coming week. Ms Sturgeon has previously said decisions about where levels would be set for each region of Scotland would be taken on a ""collaborative"" basis, but saidshe would ultimately bear accountability for them. The system will come into force from 2 November, following a vote by MSPs, and the application of different levels in different areas will be reviewed on a weekly basis. The first minister said: ""It's possible the whole country at some point could be placed in the same level. But it means we don't have to take a one size fits all approach if that's not warranted. ""A part of the country with low rates of infection won't have to live with the same levels of restrictions as a part of the country with high rates."" Covid-19 in Scotland: Five numbers to watch Half of NI's schools record Covid-19 cases Ms Sturgeon said that while case numbers were still rising across Scotland, there were ""some signs of progress"" in the data. The average number of new cases per day in Scotland has increased by 7% over the past seven days, compared with the previous week. This is down from a 29% increase on average the previous week, and a 52% jump the week before that. Ms Sturgeon said: ""Cases are still rising, which is why we cannot be complacent. But the rate of the increase does seem to be slowing down, which gives us grounds for some cautious optimism."" MSPs will hold a vote on the proposed framework next week A system of grants for businesses hit by closures or restricted trading has also been announced, with payments on a par with those offered in England. Ms Sturgeon said firms in Scotland ""deserve nothing less"", but said she wanted greater guarantees of funding from the Treasury ""as quickly as possible"". Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said Scotland had ""got a fair share"" of UK-wide funding, saying the Scottish government should ""get that funding out to businesses now"". Meanwhile, Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard said it was ""vital there is clarity over what restrictions people are living under and for how long"". The strategic framework comes alongside an expanded testing strategy, which includes a commitment to expand Scotland's testing capacity to 65,000 tests per day by the end of the year. This will include boosting the number of tests that can be processed at the UK government's Lighthouse laboratory in Glasgow, as well as NHS facilities and some smaller commercial ones. New NHS regional hubs are under construction in Grampian, Lothian and Greater Glasgow and Clyde, and are expected to take on all of the daily routine testing done in care homes around Scotland.

"It is Boris Johnson's ""ambition"" for people to celebrate Christmas with their families, his spokesman has said. The prime minister is ""hopeful"" that ""some aspects of our lives"" could be ""back to normal"" by then, he added. But a scientific adviser to the government warned without taking action a normal Christmas was ""wishful thinking in the extreme"". It comes as tougher rules come into force for nearly six million Britons - including a lockdown in Wales. Welsh health minister Vaughan Gething also brought up the prospect of Christmas, saying the 17-day national lockdown, starting at 18:00 BST, was happening now so ""we can have a much more normal Christmas season for businesses"". But Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford saidthe priority was ""saving lives not saving Christmas"". Scots have been warned the idea of a normal Christmas is a ""fiction"" and theyshould prepare for digital celebrations. What Covid tier is your area in? Scotland: New five-tier Covid alert system Wales: Lockdown to start in bid to save Christmas trade Speaking at a briefing for journalists, the No 10 spokesman said: ""The PM has been clear previously that he is hopeful that in many ways we could be able to get some aspects of our lives back to normal by Christmas. ""As I say, we've been clear about the ambition to ensure that people may celebrate Christmas as a family this year."" But earlier, government scientific adviser Prof John Edmunds said the idea that people could ""carry on as we are"" and then have a normal Christmas with friends and family was ""wishful thinking in the extreme"". Prof Edmunds, who sits on the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) committee, said: ""The only way that we can have a relatively safe and normal Christmas is if we take radical action now to reduce incidence - at the very least in high incidence areas - and keep the incidence low across the country by implementing a package of measures to reduce social contacts."" LOCKDOWN LOOK-UP:The rules in your area THREE TIERS:How will the system work? PAY-PACKET SUPPORT:What will I be paid under the new scheme? VACCINE:How close are we to finding one? Prof Edmunds was responding to comments made by government minister Stephen Barclay, who told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he hoped families would be allowed to spend Christmas together. ""I think few people expect it to be exactly as it would normally,"" said Mr Barclay - but ""the ability of families to spend Christmas together"" was ""something we all hope to be in a position to do"". Sir Jeremy Farrar, who also sits on the Sage committee that advises the government,has already warned that Christmaswould be ""tough"" and was unlikely to be the ""usual celebration"" of ""families coming together"". Meanwhile, the UK recorded another 224 deaths and 20,530 new confirmed cases on Friday. The R number for the UK has decreased slightlyand is now estimated to be between 1.2 and 1.4. That means every 10 people with the virus pass it on to 12 or 14 others, on average. Warrington is the latest placeto announce it is moving to England's highest level of restrictions - tier three. The measures will take effect next week. Nottingham and parts of Nottinghamshire are also expected to be moved into tier three next week, with the finer details such as whether or not gyms can stay open stillto be decided. South Yorkshire will also move into tier threefrom 00:01 on Saturday, by which time more than seven million people will be living under England's tightest rules. Greater Manchester, Liverpool City Region and Lancashire are already in tier three. Under tier three rules pubs and bars not serving substantial meals have to close, while household mixing is banned indoors and outdoors in hospitality settings and private gardens. Some areas have also gone further, closing businesses such as bingo halls, casinos, betting shops and soft play centres, while there is guidance against travelling in or out of the area. Rising infections mean Coventry, Stoke and Slough will move intotier two restrictions at 00:01 on Saturday. The high alert level means households are banned from mixing indoors and people are encouraged to reduce their use of public transport. Scotlandis bringing in its own five-tier system of restrictionswhich will come into force from 2 November, with the top level close to a full lockdown. In Wales, the ""firebreak"" means people will have to stay at home and pubs, restaurants, hotels and non-essential shops will close until 9 November.

"The toy aisle at Tesco on Western Avenue in Cardiff has been blocked off Supermarkets have been covering up non-essential goods as Wales enters a national lockdown. From 18:00 BST shops will be forced to close for 17 days, unless they sell essential items such as food. First Minister Mark Drakeford has said supermarkets should also stop selling items such as clothes as a matter of ""fairness"" until 9 November. But the Welsh Retail Consortium said it was ""deeply disappointed"" with the ""ill-conceived policy"". Retailers have said the rules are confusing as they have not been given any definition of what is essential. By law, clothing and homeware stores, and garden centres, will have to close during the national lockdown, while supermarkets, pharmacies and hardware stores can remain open. On Thursday, the Welsh Government said thatsupermarkets would be told not to sell non-essential goods, like clothes, toys, decorations and electrical itemsduring the 17-day firebreak. Plastic covering was seen placed over pillows and cat baskets in Asda in Coryton, Cardiff. Plastic has been seen over goods in supermarkets including microwaves and cat baskets The company said it had been given ""little time to implement these changes or clarity on what is deemed 'essential'"" and had ""expressed our deep concerns about the implications for customers accessing products they genuinely need"". Tesco said it would work ""incredibly hard"" to comply with the Welsh Government's rules, while Sainsbury's said it was ""working around the clock to put changes in place"". The Welsh Retail Consortium said: ""In spite of the dearth of government clarity, our members' focus now will be on equipping hard-working colleagues with as much information as possible given the undoubted uncertainty and complexity that has been caused by this decision.""

Guidance published for retailers on the Welsh Government's website,externalsays aisles selling homeware and decorations, toys, mobile phones, clothes and games, should be ""closed to the public"", and some areas may need to be cordoned off. Speaking at Friday's Welsh Government briefing, Mr Drakeford said the decision to stop supermarkets from selling all but essential items was based on a ""need for fair play"". ""I'm not prepared to treat small businesses in Wales in one way, requiring them to close - they are not able to earn a living during these two weeks, as part of our national efforts - and then simply because another sector in society are more powerful, are bigger, that they think that they can be treated differently. ""It is a straightforward matter of fairness, we are in this together here in Wales. ""No individual and no organisation is above the effort that we are all required to make."" Wales lockdown: Supermarkets told to sell only essential items Wales lockdown to start in bid to save Christmas trade Covid: Why is coronavirus so deadly? Mr Drakeford said ""many hundreds"" of small businesses would be closed across Wales. ""We cannot do that and then allow supermarkets to sell goods that those people are unable to sell,"" he said. He added: ""This is not a period to be browsing around supermarkets looking for non-essential goods."" The Welsh Conservatives have said businesses and the economy would be hit ""very, very hard"" by the rule, and Plaid Cymru said communication about what the rule meant was ""lacking"". Mr Drakeford said people could buy goods online Mr Drakeford defended himself from criticism of the plans saying they were making decisions under ""huge pressure."" ""We said from the very beginning that non-essential retail would close in Wales,"" he said. ""All we are doing is clarifying that and remaining consistent with that initial decision."" If people could not find essential products in supermarkets there were ways around the problem, he said, adding that friends and neighbours were ""often very willing to help"". ""There are online ways that people can purchase goods,"" Mr Drakeford said. ""It is not a problem without a solution."" Senedd Conservative leader Paul Davies said: ""It shouldn't have come to this in the first place. ""We believe that introducing this temporary national lockdown is disproportionate and will actually hit businesses and hit the economy very, very hard, and therefore in our view obviously independent retailers should be allowed to open as well."" Plaid Cymru health spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth claimed Welsh Government communication was lacking. ""I think that's been the story throughout this pandemic,"" he said. ""I've been arguing on behalf of businesses in my constituency back in May, June, July, give us plans, give us an idea of what is ahead.

"This video can not be played Marcus Rashford and his mother, Melanie, helped out at FareShare Greater Manchester. A growing number of councils in England are promising to provide free meals for children of families facing hardship during the half-term school holidays. Labour-run Birmingham City Council is one of the latest to announce it will supply vouchers - for 61,000 pupils. Tory-run Staffordshire and Kensington and Chelsea will do the same, amid a sustained campaign led by footballer Marcus Rashford. The government has ruled out extending free meals nationwide beyond term time. It said it had given councils Â£63m for families facing financial difficulties due to pandemic restrictions and had increased welfare support by Â£9.3bn. On Wednesday, the House of Commons voted against a Labour call to make free meals available across England - for those normally eligible for them in term time - during holidays for the next six months. Rashford's free meal tweets made into Google map Is there really no money for free school meals? Tory MPs attack celebrity school meal campaigners Andy Street, the Conservative Mayor of the West Midlands, said the government should have made ""a clear decision"" on whether it would or would not fund free school meals during holidays ""well in advance"". Asked if the government should have to pay for half-term meals, he said: ""I think - at the last minute - you probably do have to fund it."" During a visit to a food bank in Manchester with his mother Melanie, Mr Rashford said he would keep pushing the government to change its policy. Reacting to criticism from some MPs, including claims of ""virtue-signalling"", he told BBC Breakfast: ""I'll take that all day long as long as we start to see improvements going forward for the people that are in need of it now. That's what is important to me."" The owner of Castle Beach Cafe in Falmouth will be offering free lunch bags to children who normally get a free school meal. Fiona Crump said she thought she was doing a ""local, small thing"", but was surprised by ""the sheer volume"" of social media shares of her announcement. ""It reminds you in times of doom and gloom that the vast majority of people are delightful, helpful, caring people and the world needs to be reminded of that."" Read the full story Mr Rashford, who forced a government U-turn on free school meal vouchers for eligible pupils over the summer holidays, has beenre-tweeting details of councils,externaloffering their own schemes over half-term. Several mainly Labour local authorities have decided to take action themselves. Liverpool Council will pay for the daily lunches of 19,800 children in the city during the half-term break, beginning on Monday, while Redbridge, Hammersmith, Camden and Southwark councils in London will continue to support children eligible for free meals during term time. Greater Manchester's Mayor, Andy Burnham, is offering 1,000 vouchers for children across the region to spend on meals in Co-op stores during half-term. Newcastle City Council is providing packed lunches, while City of York Council, Rochdale Borough Council, Rotherham Council, Kirklees Council, Medway Council, Middlesbrough Council, Bradford Council and Essex County Council are among those promising more help. Conservative-controlled Kensington and Chelsea Council and Staffordshire County Council are promising a Â£15 voucher to the families of as many as 3,300 and 18,000 children respectively for food or essential supplies during the break. More than 200 children's authors and illustrators - including children's laureate Cressida Cowell, Malorie Blackman, Philip Pullman and Frank Cottrell Boyce - have also called for ""organised"" financial help from the government. Their open letter states that ""no child in this nation should go hungry this winter"" because of the pandemic and no family should have to rely on ""pot-luck charity"". A Labour MP, who did not wish to be named, said it was not sustainable for councils to pay for meals over the holidays in the long term and they hoped the government would be ""shamed into action"". Mr Rashford's parliamentary petition calling for free school meals to be extended beyond term time has attracted more than 500,000 signatures. Treasury minister Steve Barclay said all measures would be kept under review but emphasised the extra Â£9bn in support available through the welfare system, including housing allowances and hardship funds for councils. Downing Street said the government's position was ""clear"" and there would be ""no change"" in policy. And a government spokesperson said: ""This government has expanded eligibility for free school meals to more children than any other in decades."" In Scotland, the government has made Â£10m available to local councils to continue to fund free school meals over the Christmas, February and Easter breaks. Local authorities that offered provision over the October school break can apply to be reimbursed. The Welsh government has also pledged to extend free school meal provision to every school holiday until Easter 2021, spending Â£11m.

"Lily Collins plays the titular Emily, who travels to Paris to work for a marketing firm The creator of hit Netflix show Emily in Paris has defended the programme following criticism that its view of the city is idealised and clichÃ©d. US writer and executive producer Darren Star said he was ""not sorry for looking at Paris through a glamorous lens"". The show follows a young American, played by Lily Collins, who travels to the French capital for work. It has been criticised, particularly in France, for promoting stereotypical images of the city and its residents. ""No clichÃ© is spared, not even the most desperate,"" wrote Premiere's Charles Martinin his French-language review,externalwhen the show made its debut earlier this month. ""Cite a clichÃ© about France and the French [and] you will find it in Emily in Paris,""agreed 20 Minutes' Fabien Randanne,external. The Eiffel Tower is among the familiar landmarks that feature in the show Emily in Paris has faced criticism from non-French reviewers as well, with one claiming it offers ""a comic-book version"" of the French capital. ""The first half of the season is an exorcism of all of the French clichÃ©s the writers could think of,"" wrote The Guardian's Rebecca Nicholsonin her one-star review,external. The Independent's Ed Cumminggave the same rating,externalto a show whose setting he likened to ""a kind of Westworld-style Paris-themed amusement park"". Yet other critics were more forgiving,with Variety's Daniel D'Addario,externalcalling it ""a delight"" set against ""a truly inviting backdrop"". E! Online, meanwhile,let two critics offer contrasting opinions,external, variously describing the show as ""refreshing"" and ""insufferable"". Speaking to The Hollywood Reporter,external, Star, who also created Sex and the City, said he intended his new show to be ""a love letter to Paris"" seen through the eyes of Collins' title character. Star's other shows include Sex and the City and Beverly Hills, 90210 ""The first thing she is seeing is the clichÃ©s because it's from her point of view,"" he explained. ""I wanted to do a show that celebrated that part of Paris."" Earlier this month, Star revealed he had drawn on his own experiences of visiting the city. ""I wanted to showcase Paris in a really wonderful way that would encourage people to fall in love with the city in a way that I have,""he told the New York Times,external. A second series of the show has yet to be commissioned, but Star has revealed he already has ideas about what its heroine will do next. ""She'll be more of a resident of the city [in season two],""he told Oprah magazine,external. ""She'll have her feet on the ground a little more."" Collins herself told Vanity Fair,externalshe ""would love nothing more than to be able to go back to Paris"" to shoot a second season.

"Christos Pappas's lawyer said the deputy leader had made a conscious decision not to hand himself him One of the leaders of Greece's far-right Golden Dawn party has refused to turn himself in, on the day that dozens of colleagues began jail terms. Christos Pappas, 58, defied the court order and reports said Greek police were searching for him. Earlier this month, the entire leadership of Golden Dawn was convicted of running a criminal organisation. Party leader Nikos Michaloliakos and senior colleagues were given 13 years in jail, after a five-year trial. Golden Dawn had 18 MPs elected amid Greece's crippling financial crisis in 2012, but a criminal inquiry began into the party the following year after the murder of an anti-fascist musician. The sentences were passed on 14 October but Greek law does allow for the start of jail terms to be suspended during the appeals process. However, a court ruled on Thursday that most of the jail sentences should start straight away. Michaloliakos was among 37 people who turned themselves in. Giorgos Roupakias, who was convicted of the 2013 murder of the musician and given a life sentence, was under house arrest and was also handed over. Michaloliakos's daughter protested as her father was transferred to jail on Friday While Pappas evaded arrest, a former member of the party hierarchy, Ioannis Lagos, who was also convicted and faces 13 years in jail, currently has immunity as he was elected as a Europe MP last year. Christos Pappas's lawyer said his client would not surrender as he expected his conviction to be quashed on appeal. The former deputy leader also faces 13 years in jail. Greek reports said police had searched for Pappas at his Athens home and also a property in northern Greece late on Thursday. There was some surprise that police had allowed him to evade arrest as he was among several Golden Dawn figures supposedly being kept under scrutiny. Some reports indicated he had not been seen for several weeks. Citizen Protection Minister Michalis Chrysochoidis came under pressure to resign over Pappas's escape. ""You had one job!"" complained lawyer Thanassis Kampagiannis, who took part in the trial. Pappas has gone on the run before, when Golden Dawn leaders were arrested in 2013 over the murder of anti-fascist musician Pavlos Fyssas. A founder member and a close friend of the party leader, Pappas has for decades had an obsession with Nazism and was widely seen as Golden Dawn's ideological godfather. He has been photographed under a Nazi flag and filmed teaching children to do the Hitler salute. Neo-Nazi politicians guilty of running crime gang Pappas held after going on the run in Greece More than 50 people were sentenced to jail terms. Although prosecutors recommended they should all remain at liberty pending appeals, the court said on Thursday that 39 should go to jail while 12 others would remain free as their cases continued to be heard. This video can not be played Petrol bombs were met by water cannons as anti-Golden Dawn protesters clashed with police on the day of the verdict Giorgos Roupakias was taken to Malandrino jail, 200km (125 miles) to the west of the capital, to start his life sentence. Twenty of those detained, including the main leaders, were sent to Domokos prison in central Greece. Leader Nikos Michaloliakos and six party colleagues were convicted of running a criminal group (file pic) Six of the party's leaders face 13 years behind bars for running a criminal group, another 11 ex-MPs face lesser sentences of up to seven years for taking part in it. ""We will be vindicated by history and by the Greek people,"" the party leader claimed. Five Golden Dawn members were jailed for the attempted murders of Egyptian fishermen and three for the attempted murder of communist activists in the PAME union.

"Hannah Nash, with daughter Isla, spoke of the stress of getting a refund Virgin Holidays has been ordered to meet refund deadlines following Covid-related cancellations or face court action by the regulator. The company has agreed to pay refunds by 30 October for any holidays cancelled before September. Those cancelled last month or this month will be refunded by 20 November. By law, package holidays cancelled by an operator should be refunded within 14 days, but some people have waited three months to get their money back. Virgin Holidays has received 53,000 refund requests since the start of March, totalling Â£203m - a situation which it said had put the company under ""extraordinary pressure"". The company said it had 1,300 claims left to process, which it said would be done by the end of the day. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said it had received hundreds of complaints that people were not receiving refunds for holidays cancelled owing to the pandemic. It said many customers had been forced to wait for an ""unreasonably long time"", with some told the refunds would take three months. If Virgin Holidays fails to hit its deadlines, the regulator said it was prepared to take the company to court. This included refunds for Virgin Holiday Cruises. Holidaymakers have spoken to the BBC in recent months over the stress of getting refunds from Virgin Holidays. David and Natalie Rogers had their honeymoon cut short after just a few hours Newlyweds David and Natalie Rogers, from Dudley,saved for two years for their dream honeymoonsafari trip in Kenya but coronavirus ruined their plans. ""We were quite angry about having to wait on hold [to Virgin Holidays] for over eight hours, and a message on the line saying that travellers should have already received a voucher for their missed holidays. It just felt like we'd been forgotten about,"" they said. Lynn and Martin Fox had planned a once-in-a-lifetime holiday Lynn and Martin Fox hadremortgaged their home to pay for a holiday of a lifetimewith their two children in Florida. ""If only they [Virgin Holidays] would have been honest with us and communicated with us, we would have been happy. If they put a date on the refund, we could have planned. But the phone cut off calls and emails were ignored,"" Mrs Fox said. Hannah Nash and her familypaid nearly Â£7,000 for a holiday to Disney Worldin FloridaÂ but struggled to get a refund. ""The stress is making me ill. These are not small amounts for normal people,"" she told the BBC in June. Andrea Coscelli, chief executive at the CMA, said: ""Our action means that Virgin Holidays customers should receive all their money back without further delay. ""We are continuing to investigate package holidays in relation to the coronavirus crisis. Should we find that any business is not complying with consumer protection law, we won't hesitate to take action."" The regulator has issued similar warnings to other companies including Sykes Cottages andVacation Rentals. A spokesman for Virgin Holidays said: ""We have gradually reduced refund timeframes and are now 98% through the refund queue. ""Our focus now is on rebuilding trust with our customers, recognising that it has regrettably taken much longer than normal to process their refunds. We thank them sincerely for their patience throughout."" If you have a package holiday cancelled by the provider, then a refund should be provided for the whole holiday within 14 days If your flight is cancelled, you are entitled to a full refund to the original form of payment within seven days, although many airlines are struggling to meet that deadline. You can accept, or refuse, vouchers or a rebooking but a voucher will probably be invalid if the airline later goes bust If you decide against going on a future flight, which is not yet cancelled, then there is no right to a refund. Different airlines have different rules over what you can do, but many are waiving any charges for changing to a later flight or having a voucher instead. Your travel insurance is unlikely to cover you Regulation of holidays and flights is divided between the CMA and the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). The CAA has now announced that refund credit notes (RCNs) will have greater protection than normal until the end of the year. RCNs were handed out by some companies instead of refunds early in the coronavirus crisis, as the businesses found themselves stretched by the level of claims. Customers must be given a cash refund if they ask for one. RCNs can be used to book another holiday, or a refund is given when the note expires. They have been temporarily protected under the Atol scheme, which is government-guaranteed and administered by the CAA. Protection hasÂ been extended to cover any issued between 1 October and 31 December. It will apply to all relevant vouchers issued by Atol holders operating within the UK. This means that the refund will be honoured, and can be drawn from a central pot, even if the provider goes bust.

"Restaurants, pubs and non-essential shops had to close from 18:00 BST Wales has entered a national 17-day lockdown in an effort to slow the rise of Covid cases and hospital admissions. Major restrictionsto people's lives came into force at 18:00 BST on Friday. People can leave home for limited reasons including to buy food and medication, provide care, exercise or to work if they cannot do so from home. All but essential businesses have closed with economists warning the measures may cost the Welsh economy more than Â£500m. What can I do in Wales lockdown? Supermarkets covering up non-essential items WATCH: How Covid cases spread in Wales over two months The Welsh Government said any delay would have caused greater harm. But opposition parties have called for clarity on what happens at the end of the period. The number of patients in hospital in Wales with coronavirus is now thehighest since June, according to NHS Wales figures published on Friday. There were 894 people in Welsh hospitals with the virus, up 26% week-on-week, while 43 of them are in critical care, a rise of 72%. This is about two-thirds of the number at the peak. Jeremy Lovesey and Sharon Hale decided to welcome in lockdown with a takeaway Jeremy Lovesey and Sharon Hale had just picked up a Chinese takeaway in Newbridge, Caerphilly county, when lockdown began. ""We're doing what we always do on a Friday night - just chill,"" he said. ""But as far as I'm concerned - forget it, no-one is going to take any notice of it. He said the last lockdown cost him Â£3,000 in wages and put a strain on their relationship. Ms Hale said: ""At the moment, I've had breast cancer, so I'm not working at the moment, so with this Covid they won't let me back. ""Why a fortnight? What's that going to achieve? I don't think in a fortnight it's going to achieve anything."" Julian Lassman said the lockdown would lose him Â£150 a week Julian Lassman was waiting to go into the kebab shop. He works in the aviation industry and said he would lose Â£150 a week. ""I have got a young family - my son is only two, my wife works for the NHS. Basically I have lost a big chunk of my wage. ""We've just got to ride the wave. The government have done the best they can but they shouldn't have had a full lockdown from March to September because they knew it would get worse. "" In Newbridge, businesses were shut apart from the local takeaways which were busy at around 19:00. Under the new rules people cannot mix with others they do not live with. People can no longer meet others indoors, or socialise outdoors, such as in parks or people's gardens. People who live alone are allowed to meet one other household. This has to be the same one every time and there are no rules specifying they have to be within any set distance of your home. People can visit shops for essential food and medicine There is no limit to how many times people can leave the house to exercise or how far they can run, cycle, walk or jog as local lockdown boundaries have now ended. But exercising with others, such as running and cycling clubs, will not be allowed, and exercise should start from home. Police checkpoints are being set up on the border atGloucestershire to stop people travelling into Monmouthshireunless they have a reasonable excuse. Travel into or out of Wales to go on holiday or to visit a second home is illegal under the rules, and people are being told only to travel for ""essential reasons"". People can be fined Â£60 for a first restrictions offence, up to a maximum fixed penalty notice of Â£1,920 Grandparents and other relatives can still care for children, but only if no other methods of childcare are available. Indoor visits to care homes may be allowed but only in ""exceptional circumstances"", such as for end-of-life visits. Earlier on Friday children left school ahead of their half-term break. Primary and special schools will reopen as normal on 2 November after the half-term break - there is no extra time off. In secondary schools only pupils in Years 7 and 8 will go back to class during the lockdown. The national rules bring an end to the local restrictions imposed on 15 counties, as well as Bangor and Llanelli, in recent weeks. People can be fined Â£60 for a first coronavirus restrictions offence, up to a maximum fixed penalty notice of Â£1,920. Adrive-in movie theatrein Chester is no exception to these rules - after the toilets were found to be across the border with Wales. The streets of Lampeter high street looked empty when lockdown began on Friday Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price said it would be a ""difficult and challenging fortnight"" but ""without taking action now our NHS will soon be overwhelmed and thousands of lives lost"".

From 18:00 BST shops will be forced to close -unless they sell essential items,externalsuch as food. First Minister Mark Drakeford has said supermarkets should also stop selling items such as clothes as a matter of ""fairness"" until 9 November. As shops prepare for the rules to come in, plastic covering has been placed over items such as pillows and cat baskets in Asda in Coryton, Cardiff. The company said it had been given ""little time to implement these changes or clarity on what is deemed 'essential'"" - and a spokesperson ""expressed our deep concerns about the implications for customers accessing products they genuinely need"". Tesco said it would work ""incredibly hard"" to comply with the Welsh government's rules, while Sainsbury's said it was ""working around the clock to put changes in place"".

Rory Cellan-JonesTechnology correspondent People who are told to go into isolation via an alert from the NHS Covid-19 app in England and Wales will not be eligible for government support. Anyone on low income who is instructed to self-isolate in a phone call from NHS Test and Trace can claim a Â£500 payment from their local authority. Now the Department of Health has said the payments will not be available to app users,as reported by Sky News,external. However, the government is exploring ways of changing that. A spokesperson said: ""The NHS Covid-19 app is voluntary with users of it remaining anonymous, which means that currently people are not eligible for the support payment if they are advised by the app to self-isolate.""

Imogen FoulkesBBC News, Geneva The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that the next few months will be ""tough"", with the northern hemisphere in particular at a critical juncture. The head of the WHO, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said too many countries in Europe were seeing an exponential rise in cases, and he called on their governments to take ""immediate action"" to try to ensure that schools could remain open and hospitals did not become overstretched. WHO officials also said it was possible some results from its vaccine trials might be available by the end of the year, but stressed that these would be very preliminary results - ""the bare minimum required for emergency use authorisation"". Police in England will attempt to turn around drivers making non-essential journeys out of Wales during the nation's 17-day firebreak lockdown. Gloucestershire Constabulary confirmed they would patrol routes into the Forest of Dean area, on the England-Wales border, and pull over vehicles they suspected of making long journeys. If the drivers turn out to have driven out of Wales without a valid excuse they will be asked to turn around, the force said, and if they refuse they will then be reported to police in Wales - who can issue fines. A spokesman for the force said: ""While we cannot issue fines to those travelling from Wales into the county, we can inform the host force of those we stop about what has happened so they can take action."" Northern Ireland's deputy first minister has said a potential extension of the nation's four-week circuit-break restrictions cannot be taken off the table. At her first press conference since emerging from a 14-day self isolation after a family member tested positive, Michelle O'Neill said she hoped the measures could be lifted on 13 November. But she stressed an extension may be needed if the virus has not been sufficiently suppressed. ""I think if everybody works really hard at the measures we've brought into place now in this intervention, then we possibly can avoid that. I want us to be able to avoid that. But I'm honest enough to be able to say that all these things have to remain on the table."" She also said thebest way to avoid further lockdownswas to invest in a ""first-class"" test and trace system, Laurence CawleyBBC News Prime Minister Boris Johnson hailed Luton as the""way forward for the entire country""just a few weeks ago, after Covid cases there fell and local restrictions were lifted. But the rate of infection has surged in the past week. The council is now urging residents to voluntarily put themselves under tighter restrictions to avoid being put into a higher tier. How are they reacting? Read more here. A further 20,530 people have tested positive for Covid-19 in the UK, the Department of Health has said.

He insisted any suggestion the decision was based on his own politics was ""nonsensical"", amid criticism from the Welsh Conservatives. He said: ""I'm not prepared to treat small businesses in Wales in one way, requiring them to close - they are not able to earn a living during these two weeks, as part of our national efforts - and then simply because another sector in society are more powerful, are bigger, that they think that they can be treated differently. ""It is a straightforward matter of fairness, we are in this together here in Wales."" The aim of the lockdown was to ""minimise the amount of time that people spend out of their homes during the two-week period"", he said. He said it was ""not the time to browse for non-essentials"". Earlier, at the Welsh Government briefing, Drakeford said the pandemic would not be over in the coming months but added there were ""things that we can do... to make sure that Christmas of a coronavirus sort can still be celebrated here"". But he added that the priority is about ""saving lives not saving Christmas"". Linnete BahatiBBC Monitoring Throughout the pandemic, social media companies have become increasingly bold in deleting viral misinformation. The latest example: YouTube has removed a video claiming masks are ineffective against the spread of Covid-19. The group behind the video calls itself ""America's Frontline Doctors"". And on Facebook, they claimed they had been ""censored"". The video has been widely shared on other platforms. It was deleted from video sharing site Vimeo, and Facebookâs third-party fact checkers have labelled it with a warning, but it went viral on Twitter. Anyone clicking the YouTube link, however, will see a message saying that the video has been taken down because it violated the siteâs terms of service. Weâve contacted YouTube for comment. The doctors claim masks are ""completely irrelevant"" in battling coronavirus. However the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends face coverings ""to provide a barrier for potentially infectious droplets"". The first appearance of the doctorsâ group in July went viral, though that earlier video was also taken down by YouTube because it contained misinformation about Covid-19.

The Welsh Conservatives have called for urgent clarity over which items are classed as essential ahead of the ""firebreak"" lockdown in Wales. The new restrictions come into force from 18:00 BST. People are being told to stay at home, with pubs, restaurants, hotels and non-essential shops shutting for 17 days. Food shops, off-licences and pharmacies can stay open but supermarkets will beunable to sell items like clothesduring Wales' temporary lockdown. Darren Millar, shadow minister for Covid recovery, said with only hours to go until the lockdown begins, ""confusion is rife"". ""Supermarkets, convenience stores and other shops have no idea which goods the Welsh Labour-led government regards as non-essential so that they can restrict them from sale,"" he said. Millar added: ""Making last-minute diktats is irresponsible. Ministers must issue guidance immediately so that businesses and the public know where they stand."" Read our story here Rhoda OdhiamboBBC Africa Health, Nairobi Kenya has reported a sharp increase in Covid-19 cases, with more than 1,000 people confirmed to have contracted coronavirus on Thursday. This is the highest number of single-day cases to be recorded in the country since the first case was reported on 13 March. Critics say the rise in cases is a result of people not adhering to safety measures in open spaces after President Uhuru Kenyatta relaxed restrictions three weeks ago. The health ministry is holding talks with the management of about 20 hotels that will be converted into isolation facilities to ease off pressure in hospitals. Some hospitals are said to have started recording a surge in admissions. Daniel Yumbya, the chief executive of the Medical Pharmacists and Dentists Council, said the country has a total of 18,443 isolation beds - which is not enough. ""Weâre now back to negotiating with private hotels to charge the bare minimum for patients in isolation. We do not want hospitals to be overwhelmed,"" Yumbya told journalists on Thursday. Kenya has so far confirmed over 47,200 coronavirus cases with 870 deaths. Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance reporter Virgin Holidays has been ordered to meet refund deadlines following Covid-related cancellations or face court action by the regulator. The company has agreed to pay refunds by 30 October for any holidays cancelled before September. Those cancelled last month or this month will be refunded by 20 November. By law, package holidays cancelled by an operator should be refunded within 14 days, but some people have waited three months to get their money back. A spokesman for Virgin Holidays said it was ""98% through the refund queue"", adding:  ""Our focus now is on rebuilding trust with our customers, recognising that it has regrettably taken much longer than normal to process their refunds.

""We were quite angry about having to wait on hold [to Virgin Holidays] for over eight hours, and a message on the line saying that travellers should have already received a voucher for their missed holidays. It just felt like we'd been forgotten about,"" they said. Lynn and Martin Fox had planned a once-in-a-lifetime holiday Lynn and Martin Fox hadremortgaged their home to pay for a holiday of a lifetimewith their two children in Florida. ""If only they [Virgin Holidays] would have been honest with us and communicated with us, we would have been happy. If they put a date on the refund, we could have planned.

Rob CameronBBC Prague Correspondent Czech Health Minister Roman Prymula has refused calls from the country's prime minister to resign, after being pictured by a tabloid newspaper coming out of a restaurant late at night - despite all such establishments being closed. The affair has thrown the country deep into political crisis, and public confidence in government restrictions has been left in tatters. There was already considerable public grumbling at the latest restrictions, which include closing all pubs and restaurants. So when the man who thought up those rules was caught by a tabloid photographer emerging from a restaurant and without a mask, it appeared his days â perhaps hours â were numbered. However, he now says he was at a meeting in a private room in the building that also houses the restaurant, and that he put on his mask as soon as he got to his car. The country now finds itself in an unedifying and toxic political struggle â right in the middle of the worst health crisis it has ever seen.

The prime minister hopes that people will be able to celebrate Christmas ""as a family"" this year, his spokesman has said. ""The PM has been clear previously that he is hopeful that in many ways we could be able to get some aspects of our lives back to normal by Christmas,"" he told journalists at a briefing. ""We've been clear about the ambition to ensure that people may celebrate Christmas as a family this year."" It comes as one of the government's scientific advisers said the idea that ""we can carry on as we are"" and have a normal Christmas ""is wishful thinking in the extreme"". Prof John Edmunds, a member of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), said ""radical action"" would be needed - particularly in problem regions - for this to happen. Earlier, Chief Secretary to the Treasury Stephen Barclay said he hoped families would be able to spend Christmas together - but ""few people expect it to be exactly as it would normally"".

"The toy aisle at Tesco on Western Avenue in Cardiff has been blocked off Supermarkets have been covering up non-essential goods as Wales enters a national lockdown.

First Minister Mark Drakeford has said supermarkets should also stop selling items such as clothes as a matter of ""fairness"" until 9 November. But the Welsh Retail Consortium said it was ""deeply disappointed"" with the ""ill-conceived policy"". Retailers have said the rules are confusing as they have not been given any definition of what is essential. By law, clothing and homeware stores, and garden centres, will have to close during the national lockdown, while supermarkets, pharmacies and hardware stores can remain open.

Speaking at Friday's Welsh Government briefing, Mr Drakeford said the decision to stop supermarkets from selling all but essential items was based on a ""need for fair play"". ""I'm not prepared to treat small businesses in Wales in one way, requiring them to close - they are not able to earn a living during these two weeks, as part of our national efforts - and then simply because another sector in society are more powerful, are bigger, that they think that they can be treated differently.

The Welsh Conservatives have said businesses and the economy would be hit ""very, very hard"" by the rule, and Plaid Cymru said communication about what the rule meant was ""lacking"".

""We said from the very beginning that non-essential retail would close in Wales,"" he said. ""All we are doing is clarifying that and remaining consistent with that initial decision.""

"Christos Pappas's lawyer said the deputy leader had made a conscious decision not to hand himself him One of the leaders of Greece's far-right Golden Dawn party has refused to turn himself in, on the day that dozens of colleagues began jail terms. Christos Pappas, 58, defied the court order and reports said Greek police were searching for him. Earlier this month, the entire leadership of Golden Dawn was convicted of running a criminal organisation. Party leader Nikos Michaloliakos and senior colleagues were given 13 years in jail, after a five-year trial. Golden Dawn had 18 MPs elected amid Greece's crippling financial crisis in 2012, but a criminal inquiry began into the party the following year after the murder of an anti-fascist musician. The sentences were passed on 14 October but Greek law does allow for the start of jail terms to be suspended during the appeals process. However, a court ruled on Thursday that most of the jail sentences should start straight away. Michaloliakos was among 37 people who turned themselves in. Giorgos Roupakias, who was convicted of the 2013 murder of the musician and given a life sentence, was under house arrest and was also handed over. Michaloliakos's daughter protested as her father was transferred to jail on Friday While Pappas evaded arrest, a former member of the party hierarchy, Ioannis Lagos, who was also convicted and faces 13 years in jail, currently has immunity as he was elected as a Europe MP last year. Christos Pappas's lawyer said his client would not surrender as he expected his conviction to be quashed on appeal. The former deputy leader also faces 13 years in jail. Greek reports said police had searched for Pappas at his Athens home and also a property in northern Greece late on Thursday. There was some surprise that police had allowed him to evade arrest as he was among several Golden Dawn figures supposedly being kept under scrutiny. Some reports indicated he had not been seen for several weeks. Citizen Protection Minister Michalis Chrysochoidis came under pressure to resign over Pappas's escape. ""You had one job!"" complained lawyer Thanassis Kampagiannis, who took part in the trial. Pappas has gone on the run before, when Golden Dawn leaders were arrested in 2013 over the murder of anti-fascist musician Pavlos Fyssas. A founder member and a close friend of the party leader, Pappas has for decades had an obsession with Nazism and was widely seen as Golden Dawn's ideological godfather. He has been photographed under a Nazi flag and filmed teaching children to do the Hitler salute. Neo-Nazi politicians guilty of running crime gang Pappas held after going on the run in Greece More than 50 people were sentenced to jail terms. Although prosecutors recommended they should all remain at liberty pending appeals, the court said on Thursday that 39 should go to jail while 12 others would remain free as their cases continued to be heard. This video can not be played Petrol bombs were met by water cannons as anti-Golden Dawn protesters clashed with police on the day of the verdict Giorgos Roupakias was taken to Malandrino jail, 200km (125 miles) to the west of the capital, to start his life sentence. Twenty of those detained, including the main leaders, were sent to Domokos prison in central Greece. Leader Nikos Michaloliakos and six party colleagues were convicted of running a criminal group (file pic) Six of the party's leaders face 13 years behind bars for running a criminal group, another 11 ex-MPs face lesser sentences of up to seven years for taking part in it.

"Liz Truss signed the deal with Japan's Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi Britain and Japan have formally signed a trade agreement, marking the UK's first big post-Brexit deal. The deal, unveiled last month, means nearly all its exports to Japan will be tariff free while removing British tariffs on Japanese cars by 2026. UK International Trade Secretary Liz Truss called it a ""ground-breaking, British-shaped deal"". But critics have said it will boost UK GDP by only 0.07%, a fraction of the trade that could be lost with the EU. The two countries had reacheda broad agreement in September, and the deal is expected to boost trade between the UK and Japan by about Â£15bn. The deal, which was negotiated over the summer, will take effect from 1 January 2021. But some experts said it was a missed opportunity between the UK and its 11th biggest trading partner. Japan said UK-EU deal was still crucial for Japanese business, especially its carmakers Dr Minako Morita-Jaeger, international trade policy consultant and fellow of the UK Trade Policy Observatory at the University of Sussex, said: ""Given that Japanese FDI (Foreign Direct Investment) has been playing an important role in the UK economy and retaining its existing investment in post-Brexit is crucial, the UK government should have shown a strong commitment to Japanese investment by including a comprehensive investment chapter encompassing investment protection and dispute settlement."" She added that Japan was the largest investor abroad in the world, accounting for 14% of the world total in 2018. The new deal is very similar to the existing EU-Japan deal, but has an extra chapter on digital trade. ""It used to be said that an independent UK would not be able to strike major trade deals or they would take years to conclude,"" said Ms Truss at a joint press announcement with Japan's Foreign Minister, Toshimitsu Motegi. Mr Motegi said a deal between the UK and the EU was still crucial for Japanese business, particularly carmakers such as Nissan and Toyota who use parts from across Europe in vehicles they assemble in the UK. ""It is of paramount importance that the supply chain between the UK and the EU is maintained even after the UK's withdrawal,"" he said.

"Tests were carried out on the sanitiser by the Irish Department of Agriculture Health officials are looking into whether hand sanitiser used by the NHS in NI is affected by a safety recall in the Republic of Ireland. Virapro hand sanitiser is being withdrawn from sale in the Republic on the Irish government's instructions. It warned prolonged use of the product may cause skin problems, eye and respiratory irritation and headaches. Stormont's Department of Health said checks are being carried to see if any stock delivered to NI is affected. It said the Northern Ireland's Health and Social Care Board ""has not received any contact regarding recall"". The Virapro safety warning was issued by the Irish Department of Agriculture after it carried out tests on the sanitiser. The tests showed that some of the product on sale contained methanol rather than ethanol. The department stated that prolonged use of the sanitiser ""may cause dermatitis, eye irritation, upper respiratory system irritation and headaches"". As a result, it has removed Virapro hand sanitiser fromIreland's biocidal product register,external, which outlines products that are legally allowed to be sold in Ireland. ""This product may not remain on the market or be made available for use,"" the department said in a statement on Thursday night. ""Members of the public are advised to stop using this sanitiser with immediate effect."" It instructed the Dublin-based firm which sells the item to begin ""an immediate recall of all product"". Trade publications earlier this year reported that during the early stages of the pandemic, when there were worldwide shortages of hand sanitiser, Virapro delivered orders to both the Health Service Executive in the Republic of Ireland and the NHS in Northern Ireland.

"This video can not be played Mixed views on the firebreak in Wales' first local lockdown area Wales' 17-day lockdown will start later, with the first minister saying the priority is about ""saving lives not saving Christmas"". From 18:00 BST people are being told to stay at home, with all but essential businesses closed. Economists have warned the lockdown may cost the economy more than Â£500m and the Conservatives have accused ministers of having ""no exit plan"". But the Welsh Government said any delay would have caused greater harm. Pubs, bars, restaurants and hotels, as well as all non-essential shops will have to close, with people being told only to travel for essential reasons, such as for medical treatment, to buy food and to exercise. The nationwide ""firebreak"", which comes after local lockdowns in communities, aims to slow the rise in Covid cases and hospital admissions. What you need to know about new Covid rules around the UK What are the rules where I live? First Minister Mark Drakeford has reassured the public the ""short, sharp"" lockdown will end as planned on 9 November, with consistent Wales-wide measures coming afterwards. But the Welsh Conservatives and Plaid Cymru have accused the Welsh Government of not having an ""exit strategy"" to end the spread of the virus and restart the economy. At Friday's Welsh Government briefing, First Minister Mark Drakeford said the pandemic would not be over in the coming months but added there were ""things that we can do... to make sure that Christmas of a coronavirus sort can still be celebrated here in Wales"". He added: ""How that will mesh in with the difficulties that are being faced elsewhere in the United Kingdom is just impossible to predict."" The national lockdown brings an end to the local lockdowns imposed on 15 counties, as well as the city of Bangor and town of Llanelli in recent weeks. People can be fined Â£60 for a first coronavirus restrictions offence, up to a maximum fixed penalty notice of Â£1,920. Q&A: What can you do in Wales-wide lockdown? Why has Wales chosen a national lockdown? When would we know a circuit-breaker is working? Primary schools will reopen after next week's half-term break, but only Years 7 and 8 in secondary schools can return at that time under the new rules. It comes as stricter coronavirus rules are coming into force for nearly six million Britons on Friday, including Warrington moving into thehighest level of England's Covid-19 restrictionsalongsideGreater Manchester,LiverpoolCity Region andLancashireafter a surge of Covid-19 cases. Shoppers headed to the high street in Cardiff before stores close tonight Speaking onBBC Radio Wales Breakfast, Health Minister Vaughan Gething said there would be ""greater"" economic harm if the Welsh NHS becomes overwhelmed and there were ""deeper and harder"" measures for a longer period of time. ""If we do this now and if we then have a consistent set of national rules, to keep the transmission and the intensity of the virus at a lower level, then we can have a much more normal Christmas season for businesses,"" he said. ""The month of December is really important for many businesses, if we delayed, we would have almost certainly impacted upon that part of the season."" Dr Margaret Harris, World Health Organization spokeswoman, said people should start planning how to safely celebrate Christmas. ""It will be a new Christmas, but we can enjoy our time together,"" she said. ""We just have to do it slightly apart."" On Friday people enjoyed a drink in Cardiff before bars close at 18:00 But the Welsh Conservatives have accused the Welsh Government of having no plan for what will happen after the Wales-wide lockdown ends. The party's leader in the Senedd Paul Davies said the Welsh Government should be looking at ""hyper-local"" lockdowns rather than imposing a ""damaging"" national lockdown. ""The first minister is taking us into a Wales-wide lockdown without publishing the full data to justify it, the details of what they are going to achieve during the lockdown and now we don't know what the situation is going to be at the end of it,"" he said. ""People are concerned that this second Wales-wide lockdown is just the start of rolling lockdowns over the coming."" Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price said the Welsh Government needed to publish plans on how systems to halt the spread of the virus - including track and trace - would be improved during the next two weeks. ""No-one wants to live in a perpetual state of coming in and out of lockdowns. For the sake of public health and our economy, this break has to be the start of a different approach,"" he said.

The UK's average is between 1.3 and 1.5. Even though Wales has some of the lowest coronavirus infection rates in the UK, First Minister Mark Drakeford said that without this lockdown theWelsh NHS would not be able to cope. The number of patients in hospital in Wales with coronavirus is now the highest since June, according to NHS Wales figures out on Friday. There were 894 people in Welsh hospitals with the virus, up 26% week-on-week, while 43 of them are in critical care, a rise of 72%. This is about two-thirds of the number at the peak. Food shops, off-licences and pharmacies can stay open but supermarkets will beunable to sell items like clothesduring Wales' temporary lockdown and only essential items. Business leaders say companies in Wales have been given just hours to finalise plans for the firebreak. Among those affected was the former winner of the BBC's The Apprentice, Alana Spencer, who was due to open a new cafe on the Aberystwyth sea front on Friday. In atearful social media post,external, she said she was ""gutted"" by the timing and later added it was a ""devastating blow"" to her new business. ""I took to social media and I had a small melt-down,"" she said. Alana Spencer said lockdown was a ""bitter pill to swallow"" in an area with the lowest case rate in Wales However she told BBC Radio Wales she will now use the takeaway service during lockdown to trial new products. ""Luckily we have a hatch on the front so we can do takeaway, so we'll take it from there and open properly at the end of the lockdown,"" she said. ""It's a bitter pill to swallow, when we are in Ceredigion, we have lower numbers and we are being very sensible here, but ultimately people's lives are at risk."" Organisers of an unlicensed rave which attracted 3,000 people in Neath Port Talbot in August were fined Â£10,000 People can be issued a fixed penalty notice ""for most types of breaches"" and fined Â£60 for the first offence. That fine is increased to Â£120 for a second offence and continues to double for repeated offences, up to a maximum of Â£1,920. If prosecuted, however, a court can impose anunlimited fine. Residents of Caerphilly county were the first to go into a local lockdown on 8 September. Key worker Lois Griffiths's son and daughter will continue to go to a childminder as she has to carry on working. Lois Griffiths and daughter Amy are trying to carry on with their lives ""as best they can"" ""I've got to carry on with my life,"" she said. ""We can't just stick in the house and do nothing - we've got to earn money."" Her 10-year-old daughter Amy is disappointed because lockdown means she can't go to her dance class. ""I feel really sad because I've got 'Team' coming up and I don't want to stop doing that,"" she said. Hair stylist Ellen Watkins is worried about the financial impact of the Covid-19 lockdown Unique Creations has been ""chock-a-block"" as people want a pre-lockdown trim before the hair salon on Blackwood High Street closes on Friday evening. ""We're flat out,"" said stylist Ellen Watkins. ""I'm hoping it will be the same when we come back. There's a lot of worry. I'm looking to buy a house. ""Financially where am I going to be if the salon can't open back up? It's a really scary time for me."" This video can not be played One salon owner says demand has 'doubled' this week The timing has been called""an absolute dog's dinner"" for Welsh businessesas it straddles two UK government financial support schemes - and firms will have to apply for both separately. Furloughends on 31 October but the newJob Support Scheme(JSS) starts on 1 November - and to be eligible for the remaining week of furlough, workers must have already been furloughed for at least three consecutive weeks. On Friday, Finance Minister Rebecca Evans announced an extra Â£5m to help small firms retain workers not eligible for the remaining week of furlough, while another Â£5m will be added to the Discretionary Assistance Fund for people waiting for benefits or facing hardship while still working. Non-essential retailers will be told to close for 17 days from Friday Mr Drakeford had said hefeared employees could face redundancyif the Treasury does not change its support for workers. The Welsh Government had asked for the JSS to be brought forward, or furlough restrictions eased, for the length of the lockdown, and offered to pay the cost for the difference between furlough and the JSS, estimated at Â£11m. However the UK government said ministers in Cardiff knew ""full well"" it was not possible for the Treasury, adding the timing of Wales' lockdown was ""very, very unfair"" on people ""caught by the time gap"". The Treasury said the UK government had provided billions in support to Wales. EASY STEPS:How to keep safe A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? TRAVEL PLANS:What are your rights? IN-DEPTH:Coronavirus pandemic The National Institute Of Economic and Social Research says that up-front cost ""must be set against potential economic benefits"" after lockdown if it is successful in reducing the spread of the virus and restoring economic confidence. More than 100,000 people in Wales work in the accommodation and food industries while nearly 200,000 work in the wholesale and retail trades and car repairs. Estate agents have to close and house viewings and valuations have to stop, a blow for the Haus agency which is to open its new Cardiff branch on Friday - only to close for two weeks in the evening. ""It's been such a challenging time,"" said director Chris Birch. ""Everything involved in running a business, let alone moving in a global pandemic, has taken so much longer and the admin and red tape is another level."" Public health officials and politicians have warned they will not know the full impact of the firebreak lockdown until after it ends on 9 November. Giri Shankar, from Public Health Wales, said there was ""always a lag phase of about two to three weeks"" before any visible change of that intervention can be measured and detected"". This video can not be played Wales' first minister said without acting now the NHS would not be able to look after the increasing number of seriously ill people But the first minister has said the lockdown end date is fixed as to avoid further harm to the economy. Wales, though, has been warned of the possibility of another lockdown early in the new year if Covid-19 starts spreading quickly again at Christmas.

He said the last lockdown cost him Â£3,000 in wages and put a strain on their relationship. Ms Hale said: ""At the moment, I've had breast cancer, so I'm not working at the moment, so with this Covid they won't let me back. ""Why a fortnight? What's that going to achieve? I don't think in a fortnight it's going to achieve anything."" Julian Lassman said the lockdown would lose him Â£150 a week Julian Lassman was waiting to go into the kebab shop.

""We've just got to ride the wave. The government have done the best they can but they shouldn't have had a full lockdown from March to September because they knew it would get worse. "" In Newbridge, businesses were shut apart from the local takeaways which were busy at around 19:00. Under the new rules people cannot mix with others they do not live with. People can no longer meet others indoors, or socialise outdoors, such as in parks or people's gardens. People who live alone are allowed to meet one other household. This has to be the same one every time and there are no rules specifying they have to be within any set distance of your home. People can visit shops for essential food and medicine There is no limit to how many times people can leave the house to exercise or how far they can run, cycle, walk or jog as local lockdown boundaries have now ended. But exercising with others, such as running and cycling clubs, will not be allowed, and exercise should start from home.

First Minister Mark Drakeford has said supermarkets should also stop selling items such as clothes as a matter of ""fairness"" until 9 November. As shops prepare for the rules to come in, plastic covering has been placed over items such as pillows and cat baskets in Asda in Coryton, Cardiff. The company said it had been given ""little time to implement these changes or clarity on what is deemed 'essential'"" - and a spokesperson ""expressed our deep concerns about the implications for customers accessing products they genuinely need"".

Rory Cellan-JonesTechnology correspondent People who are told to go into isolation via an alert from the NHS Covid-19 app in England and Wales will not be eligible for government support. Anyone on low income who is instructed to self-isolate in a phone call from NHS Test and Trace can claim a Â£500 payment from their local authority. Now the Department of Health has said the payments will not be available to app users,as reported by Sky News,external. However, the government is exploring ways of changing that. A spokesperson said: ""The NHS Covid-19 app is voluntary with users of it remaining anonymous, which means that currently people are not eligible for the support payment if they are advised by the app to self-isolate.""

Imogen FoulkesBBC News, Geneva The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that the next few months will be ""tough"", with the northern hemisphere in particular at a critical juncture. The head of the WHO, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said too many countries in Europe were seeing an exponential rise in cases, and he called on their governments to take ""immediate action"" to try to ensure that schools could remain open and hospitals did not become overstretched. WHO officials also said it was possible some results from its vaccine trials might be available by the end of the year, but stressed that these would be very preliminary results - ""the bare minimum required for emergency use authorisation"". Police in England will attempt to turn around drivers making non-essential journeys out of Wales during the nation's 17-day firebreak lockdown. Gloucestershire Constabulary confirmed they would patrol routes into the Forest of Dean area, on the England-Wales border, and pull over vehicles they suspected of making long journeys. If the drivers turn out to have driven out of Wales without a valid excuse they will be asked to turn around, the force said, and if they refuse they will then be reported to police in Wales - who can issue fines. A spokesman for the force said: ""While we cannot issue fines to those travelling from Wales into the county, we can inform the host force of those we stop about what has happened so they can take action."" Northern Ireland's deputy first minister has said a potential extension of the nation's four-week circuit-break restrictions cannot be taken off the table. At her first press conference since emerging from a 14-day self isolation after a family member tested positive, Michelle O'Neill said she hoped the measures could be lifted on 13 November. But she stressed an extension may be needed if the virus has not been sufficiently suppressed. ""I think if everybody works really hard at the measures we've brought into place now in this intervention, then we possibly can avoid that. I want us to be able to avoid that. But I'm honest enough to be able to say that all these things have to remain on the table."" She also said thebest way to avoid further lockdownswas to invest in a ""first-class"" test and trace system, Laurence CawleyBBC News Prime Minister Boris Johnson hailed Luton as the""way forward for the entire country""just a few weeks ago, after Covid cases there fell and local restrictions were lifted. But the rate of infection has surged in the past week. The council is now urging residents to voluntarily put themselves under tighter restrictions to avoid being put into a higher tier. How are they reacting? Read more here. A further 20,530 people have tested positive for Covid-19 in the UK, the Department of Health has said.

He insisted any suggestion the decision was based on his own politics was ""nonsensical"", amid criticism from the Welsh Conservatives. He said: ""I'm not prepared to treat small businesses in Wales in one way, requiring them to close - they are not able to earn a living during these two weeks, as part of our national efforts - and then simply because another sector in society are more powerful, are bigger, that they think that they can be treated differently. ""It is a straightforward matter of fairness, we are in this together here in Wales."" The aim of the lockdown was to ""minimise the amount of time that people spend out of their homes during the two-week period"", he said. He said it was ""not the time to browse for non-essentials"". Earlier, at the Welsh Government briefing, Drakeford said the pandemic would not be over in the coming months but added there were ""things that we can do... to make sure that Christmas of a coronavirus sort can still be celebrated here"". But he added that the priority is about ""saving lives not saving Christmas"". Linnete BahatiBBC Monitoring Throughout the pandemic, social media companies have become increasingly bold in deleting viral misinformation. The latest example: YouTube has removed a video claiming masks are ineffective against the spread of Covid-19. The group behind the video calls itself ""America's Frontline Doctors"". And on Facebook, they claimed they had been ""censored"". The video has been widely shared on other platforms. It was deleted from video sharing site Vimeo, and Facebookâs third-party fact checkers have labelled it with a warning, but it went viral on Twitter. Anyone clicking the YouTube link, however, will see a message saying that the video has been taken down because it violated the siteâs terms of service. Weâve contacted YouTube for comment. The doctors claim masks are ""completely irrelevant"" in battling coronavirus. However the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends face coverings ""to provide a barrier for potentially infectious droplets"".

The Welsh Conservatives have called for urgent clarity over which items are classed as essential ahead of the ""firebreak"" lockdown in Wales. The new restrictions come into force from 18:00 BST. People are being told to stay at home, with pubs, restaurants, hotels and non-essential shops shutting for 17 days. Food shops, off-licences and pharmacies can stay open but supermarkets will beunable to sell items like clothesduring Wales' temporary lockdown. Darren Millar, shadow minister for Covid recovery, said with only hours to go until the lockdown begins, ""confusion is rife"". ""Supermarkets, convenience stores and other shops have no idea which goods the Welsh Labour-led government regards as non-essential so that they can restrict them from sale,"" he said. Millar added: ""Making last-minute diktats is irresponsible. Ministers must issue guidance immediately so that businesses and the public know where they stand."" Read our story here Rhoda OdhiamboBBC Africa Health, Nairobi Kenya has reported a sharp increase in Covid-19 cases, with more than 1,000 people confirmed to have contracted coronavirus on Thursday. This is the highest number of single-day cases to be recorded in the country since the first case was reported on 13 March. Critics say the rise in cases is a result of people not adhering to safety measures in open spaces after President Uhuru Kenyatta relaxed restrictions three weeks ago. The health ministry is holding talks with the management of about 20 hotels that will be converted into isolation facilities to ease off pressure in hospitals. Some hospitals are said to have started recording a surge in admissions. Daniel Yumbya, the chief executive of the Medical Pharmacists and Dentists Council, said the country has a total of 18,443 isolation beds - which is not enough. ""Weâre now back to negotiating with private hotels to charge the bare minimum for patients in isolation. We do not want hospitals to be overwhelmed,"" Yumbya told journalists on Thursday. Kenya has so far confirmed over 47,200 coronavirus cases with 870 deaths. Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance reporter Virgin Holidays has been ordered to meet refund deadlines following Covid-related cancellations or face court action by the regulator.

By law, package holidays cancelled by an operator should be refunded within 14 days, but some people have waited three months to get their money back. A spokesman for Virgin Holidays said it was ""98% through the refund queue"", adding:  ""Our focus now is on rebuilding trust with our customers, recognising that it has regrettably taken much longer than normal to process their refunds. We thank them sincerely for their patience throughout."" Meanwhile, holidaymakers have spoken to the BBC in recent months over the stress of getting refunds from Virgin Holidays. David and Natalie Rogers had their honeymoon cut short after just a few hours Newlyweds David and Natalie Rogers, from Dudley,saved for two years for their dream honeymoonsafari trip to Kenya but coronavirus ruined their plans. ""We were quite angry about having to wait on hold [to Virgin Holidays] for over eight hours, and a message on the line saying that travellers should have already received a voucher for their missed holidays. It just felt like we'd been forgotten about,"" they said. Lynn and Martin Fox had planned a once-in-a-lifetime holiday Lynn and Martin Fox hadremortgaged their home to pay for a holiday of a lifetimewith their two children in Florida. ""If only they [Virgin Holidays] would have been honest with us and communicated with us, we would have been happy. If they put a date on the refund, we could have planned. But the phone cut off calls and emails were ignored,"" Mrs Fox said. Read the full story here. Can I go into someone's house for a service such as hairdressing in tier two?

As more and more people across England face tougher restrictions, we've answered some of your questions aboutthe new three-tier system of restrictions. Check out our answers here. Rob CameronBBC Prague Correspondent Czech Health Minister Roman Prymula has refused calls from the country's prime minister to resign, after being pictured by a tabloid newspaper coming out of a restaurant late at night - despite all such establishments being closed. The affair has thrown the country deep into political crisis, and public confidence in government restrictions has been left in tatters. There was already considerable public grumbling at the latest restrictions, which include closing all pubs and restaurants. So when the man who thought up those rules was caught by a tabloid photographer emerging from a restaurant and without a mask, it appeared his days â perhaps hours â were numbered. However, he now says he was at a meeting in a private room in the building that also houses the restaurant, and that he put on his mask as soon as he got to his car. The country now finds itself in an unedifying and toxic political struggle â right in the middle of the worst health crisis it has ever seen. US retailerGap could close all of its own UK stores, putting thousands of jobs at risk, as it mulls shifting its operations to franchise-only in Europe. It may close all of its shops in the UK, France, Ireland and Italy next summer,the retailer said,external. Gap could also close its European distribution centre in Rugby. The retailer, which has seen sales fall in recent years, reported a Â£740m loss in the three months to May due to coronavirus disruption. Instead of operating its own stores, Gap said it was looking at whether to move to a franchise model. Read the full story here. The prime minister hopes that people will be able to celebrate Christmas ""as a family"" this year, his spokesman has said. ""The PM has been clear previously that he is hopeful that in many ways we could be able to get some aspects of our lives back to normal by Christmas,"" he told journalists at a briefing. ""We've been clear about the ambition to ensure that people may celebrate Christmas as a family this year."" It comes as one of the government's scientific advisers said the idea that ""we can carry on as we are"" and have a normal Christmas ""is wishful thinking in the extreme"". Prof John Edmunds, a member of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), said ""radical action"" would be needed - particularly in problem regions - for this to happen. Earlier, Chief Secretary to the Treasury Stephen Barclay said he hoped families would be able to spend Christmas together - but ""few people expect it to be exactly as it would normally"".

"The toy aisle at Tesco on Western Avenue in Cardiff has been blocked off Supermarkets have been covering up non-essential goods as Wales enters a national lockdown. From 18:00 BST shops will be forced to close for 17 days, unless they sell essential items such as food. First Minister Mark Drakeford has said supermarkets should also stop selling items such as clothes as a matter of ""fairness"" until 9 November. But the Welsh Retail Consortium said it was ""deeply disappointed"" with the ""ill-conceived policy"". Retailers have said the rules are confusing as they have not been given any definition of what is essential. By law, clothing and homeware stores, and garden centres, will have to close during the national lockdown, while supermarkets, pharmacies and hardware stores can remain open. On Thursday, the Welsh Government said thatsupermarkets would be told not to sell non-essential goods, like clothes, toys, decorations and electrical itemsduring the 17-day firebreak. Plastic covering was seen placed over pillows and cat baskets in Asda in Coryton, Cardiff. Plastic has been seen over goods in supermarkets including microwaves and cat baskets The company said it had been given ""little time to implement these changes or clarity on what is deemed 'essential'"" and had ""expressed our deep concerns about the implications for customers accessing products they genuinely need"". Tesco said it would work ""incredibly hard"" to comply with the Welsh Government's rules, while Sainsbury's said it was ""working around the clock to put changes in place"". The Welsh Retail Consortium said: ""In spite of the dearth of government clarity, our members' focus now will be on equipping hard-working colleagues with as much information as possible given the undoubted uncertainty and complexity that has been caused by this decision.""

Guidance published for retailers on the Welsh Government's website,externalsays aisles selling homeware and decorations, toys, mobile phones, clothes and games, should be ""closed to the public"", and some areas may need to be cordoned off. Speaking at Friday's Welsh Government briefing, Mr Drakeford said the decision to stop supermarkets from selling all but essential items was based on a ""need for fair play"". ""I'm not prepared to treat small businesses in Wales in one way, requiring them to close - they are not able to earn a living during these two weeks, as part of our national efforts - and then simply because another sector in society are more powerful, are bigger, that they think that they can be treated differently. ""It is a straightforward matter of fairness, we are in this together here in Wales. ""No individual and no organisation is above the effort that we are all required to make."" Wales lockdown: Supermarkets told to sell only essential items Wales lockdown to start in bid to save Christmas trade Covid: Why is coronavirus so deadly? Mr Drakeford said ""many hundreds"" of small businesses would be closed across Wales. ""We cannot do that and then allow supermarkets to sell goods that those people are unable to sell,"" he said. He added: ""This is not a period to be browsing around supermarkets looking for non-essential goods."" The Welsh Conservatives have said businesses and the economy would be hit ""very, very hard"" by the rule, and Plaid Cymru said communication about what the rule meant was ""lacking"". Mr Drakeford said people could buy goods online Mr Drakeford defended himself from criticism of the plans saying they were making decisions under ""huge pressure."" ""We said from the very beginning that non-essential retail would close in Wales,"" he said. ""All we are doing is clarifying that and remaining consistent with that initial decision."" If people could not find essential products in supermarkets there were ways around the problem, he said, adding that friends and neighbours were ""often very willing to help"". ""There are online ways that people can purchase goods,"" Mr Drakeford said. ""It is not a problem without a solution."" Senedd Conservative leader Paul Davies said: ""It shouldn't have come to this in the first place. ""We believe that introducing this temporary national lockdown is disproportionate and will actually hit businesses and hit the economy very, very hard, and therefore in our view obviously independent retailers should be allowed to open as well.""

"This video can not be played What you missed - the best bits from Trump and Biden's final debate US President Donald Trump and his White House challenger Joe Biden clashed over Covid and race while trading corruption charges, in their final live TV debate. On the pandemic, Mr Biden would not rule out more lockdowns, while Mr Trump insisted it was time to reopen the US. Mr Trump cited unsubstantiated claims Mr Biden personally profited from his son's business dealings. The Democrat brought up Mr Trump's opaque taxes. Mr Biden has a solid lead with 11 days to go until the presidential election. But winning the most votes does not always win the election, and the margin is narrower in a handful of states that could decide the race either way. Live updates: The scramble to claim victory Final debate fact-checked Key takeaways from the debate More than 47 million people have already cast their ballots in a voting surge driven by the pandemic. This is already more than voted before polling day in the 2016 election. There are about 230 million eligible voters in total. In snap polls - from CNN, Data Progress and US Politics - most respondents said Mr Biden had won the debate by a margin of more than 50% to about 40%. Thursday night's primetime duel in Nashville, Tennessee, was a less acrimonious and more substantive affair than the pair's previous showdown on 29 September, which devolved into insults and name-calling. Following that political brawl, debate organisers this time muted microphones during the candidates' opening statements on each topic to minimise disruption. But the 90-minute debate, moderated by NBC's Kristen Welker, was the scene of plenty of personal attacks between the opponents, whose mutual dislike was palpable. Did Trump or Biden sway these voters? And the winner was... Kristen Welker The debate in pictures In individual closing argument to voters, they offered starkly different visions for the nation on everything from shutting down the country to tackle coronavirus, to shutting down the fossil fuel industry to confront climate change. This video can not be played Body language expert Mary Civiello gives her view on Trump and Biden's body language Nowhere was the distinction between the two candidates more apparent than in their approach to the pandemic. Asked about his support for more lockdowns if the scientists recommended it, Mr Biden, a Democrat, did not rule it out. But Mr Trump, a Republican, said it was wrong to inflict further damage on the economy because of an infection from which most people recover. ""This is a massive country with a massive economy,"" said the president. ""People are losing their jobs, they're committing suicide. There's depression, alcohol, drugs at a level nobody's ever seen before."" This video can not be played Presidential debate: Trump and Biden clash on Covid response Mr Trump, 74, declared that the virus was ""going away"" and that a vaccine would be ready by the end of the year, while Mr Biden warned the nation was heading towards ""a dark winter"". The president said: ""We're learning to live with it."" Mr Biden, 77, countered: ""Come on. We're dying with it."" Mr Biden laid blame for the 220,000-plus American deaths as a consequence of the pandemic at Mr Trump's door. ""Anyone who's responsible for that many deaths should not remain president of the United States of America,"" he said. During a back-and-forth on race relations, Mr Trump said: ""I am the least racist person in this room."" He brought up the 1994 crime bill that Mr Biden helped draft and which Black Lives Matter blames for the mass incarceration of African Americans. A simple guide to the US election How is Donald Trump doing in the polls? Why Abraham Lincoln starred in the election debate But Mr Biden said Mr Trump was ""one of the most racist presidents we've had in modern history. He pours fuel on every single racist fire"". He added: ""This guy is a [racial] dog whistle about as big as a fog horn."" Once again, Mr Biden largely held up under fire - avoiding the kind of gaffes and stumbles that could have played into Republican attempts to question his age and mental acuity. The Trump campaign will try to make an issue out of Mr Biden's call for a ""transition"" from oil-based energy - a risky thing to throw in at the tail end of the debate. In an era of hybrid cars and energy-efficient homes, however, when even petroleum companies employ similar language, it may not hit Americans as hard as Republicans imagine. In the end, the raucous first debate probably will be what the history books record. And with polls showing most Americans already having made up their minds - and more than 45 million already having voted - the chance that this evening has a lasting impact on the race seems slim. Read more from Anthony Mr Trump brought up purported leaked emails from Mr Biden's son, Hunter, about his business dealings in China. But Mr Biden denied the president's unfounded insinuation that the former US vice-president somehow had a stake in the ventures. This video can not be played Explaining the Electoral College and which voters will decide who wins ""I think you owe an explanation to the American people,"" said Mr Trump. What was Hunter Biden doing in Ukraine and China? Mr Biden said: ""I have not taken a single penny from any country whatsoever. Ever."" The former vice-president referred to the New York Times recently reporting that Mr Trump had a bank account in China and paid $188,561 in taxes from 2013-15 to the country, compared with $750 in US federal taxes that the newspaper said he had paid in 2016-17 when he became president. ""I have many bank accounts and they're all listed and they're all over the place,"" said Mr Trump. ""I mean, I was a businessman doing business."" Who will be the next US president? You decide Why we might not get a result on election night Has Trump delivered on his promises? Full coverage of the US election Mr Biden described climate change as an ""existential threat to humanity"" and attacked Mr Trump for cutting curbs on polluters. ""Four more years of this man eliminating all the regulations that were put in by us to clean up the climate... will put us in the position where we're going to be in real trouble,"" he said. Mr Trump defended his decision to pull out of the Paris Climate Accord, saying he would not ""sacrifice tens of millions of jobs, thousands and thousands of companies"" for the agreement. The two clashed on energy policy, as Mr Trump asked his challenger: ""Would you close down the oil industry?"" ""I would transition from the oil industry, yes,"" said Mr Biden, adding, ""because the oil industry pollutes significantly."" Where Trump and Biden stand on guns, race and climate He said Big Oil - a reference to big oil companies - had to be replaced by renewable energy over time with the US moving towards net zero emissions. ""Basically what he's saying is he's going to destroy the oil industry,"" said Mr Trump. ""Will you remember that, Texas? Will you remember that, Pennsylvania, Oklahoma, Ohio?"" The Biden campaign afterwards said their candidate had been talking about ending oil subsidies. The two again argued when Mr Trump was asked about his policy of separating hundreds of children from undocumented immigrant adults at the southern US border. The president pointed out that migrant children were also detained under the Obama administration. This video can not be played Presidential debate: Trump says catch and release only works on those with 'lowest IQs' ""Who built the cages, Joe?"" he said, referring to the chain-link enclosures where unaccompanied migrant children were held during the Obama-Biden administration. But the former vice-president said the Trump administration had gone further by separating families and the practice was ""criminal"". Not surprisingly, both candidates accused the other of unfulfilled promises while in office. Mr Biden took his opponent to task for his pledges to come up with a healthcare plan to replace Mr Obama's Affordable Care Act. Mr Trump had been talking about making such a move for years but ""he's never come up with a plan"", the Democrat said. The president, meanwhile, talked about what he said was Mr Biden's own inactivity while in office. ""You keep talking about all these things you're going to do... but you were there just a short time ago and you guys did nothing,"" he said. ""Joe, I ran because of you. I ran because of Barack Obama, because you did a poor job.""

"Wales is preparing for a 17-day national lockdown from 18:00 BST tonight with pubs, restaurants and non-essential retail closing People are asked to stay at home and only go out if absolutely necessary First Minister Mark Drakeford says the order for supermarkets not to sell non-essential goods is to ensure fairness to traders forced to close Catherine Evans and Andy Roberts That's all from today's live page - thank you for joining us for
the latest developments on the coronavirus outbreak in Wales. Our latest stories are:  Until our next live blog, we'll keep you updated via the BBC News website and our social media channels. Have a good evening - stay safe and well.  Analysis of thousands of swab results means it has been estimated that 16,700 people in Wales had coronavirus in the week ending 16 October. The Office for National Statistics undertakes its own infection survey across the UK. It estimates that about0.55% or one in 180 people, had the virus in Wales.,external This is 8,800 more people than estimated in the previous week. Over a six-week period, it asked 13,270 people in Wales for nose or throat swabs. It tested the results and found 43 positive results, from 33 people from 25 households. In England, ONS estimated that one in 130 were infected; positivity rates are higher than 1% in three regions, north west and north east England and Yorkshire and Humberside. Another 13 Covid-related deaths have been confirmed in Wales, taking the total since the pandemic began to 1,756. Five of these deaths were in the Betsi Cadwaladr health board area of north Wales, which has the highest total. There were three more deaths in Cwm Taf in south Wales, two in Hywel Dda in west Wales, two in Swansea Bay, and one in the Aneurin Bevan board area of south east Wales. Thirteen more people have died with coronavirus in Wales, according to Public Health Wales. This brings the total number of deaths since the pandemic began to 1,756. There were 761 new cases reported today. The total number of confirmed cases in Wales is 40,253. This video can not be played Crowds of revellers made it one final party night before the firebreak lockdown spells last orders for Wales. Cardiff's city centre streets swelled on Thursday night ahead of the two-week national shutdown that will see pubs and clubs closed. Despite the 22:00 curfew for serving alcohol, areas such as St Mary Street and Mill Lane were filled as the party atmosphere carried on to the streets. But from 18:00 BST on Friday, venues will have to shut as everyone in Wales is told: ""Stay at home"". The number of patients in
hospital in Wales with coronavirus is now the highest since June and up to two-thirds the numbers seen during the pandemicâs peak. According to the latest figures
from NHS Wales Informatics:     Local Covid-19 spikes can be detected in waste water, a pilot scheme has found. The
  programme, launched in June, is now monitoring 20 sewage systems across Wales and
  covers 80% of the Welsh population. It could act as an early warning sign of local peaks in coronavirus. However, the World Health Organisation says there
  is no evidence that coronavirus is spread via sewage systems.  If
there are ""genuine cases of people who cannot find something that is
essential to them in a supermarket"" there will be ""other ways in
which that problem can be solved,"" Wales' first minister has said. Mark Drakeford said: ""People are very inventive. ""They have friends, they
have neighbours, who are in a Welsh context, we know, very often very willing
to help. ""There are online ways that
people can purchase goods. ""It is not a problem
without a solution."" First Minister Mark Drakeford has been explaining why supermarkets are not allowed to sell non-essential goods during Wales's national lockdown which begins tonight. He said it was ""a simple matter of fair play"" to the ""many hundreds"" of small stores who stock those goods who are being forced to close for the next 17 days. Local Democracy Reporting Service Two pubs in the south Wales valleys are among the latest to have been ordered to close for not following coronavirus rules. The closure order for the Rock Inn, Aberaman, said customers were allowed to complete their own track-and-trace details resulting in fictitious
names being left, as well as possible data protection breaches and risk of virus transmission. The notice also said the premises were crowded and with customers standing in small groups with drinks and not social distancing. Meanwhile the Tynte Hotel in Abercynon has also been told to close after police were called in response to reports of large numbers of people there. Body camera footage showed severe breaches of overcrowding, a lack of social distancing and bar service being undertaken, according to Rhondda Cynon Taf council. The notice also said that names and phone numbers in the track-and-trace record book did not accurately reflect the number of people police found at the premises. Customers and staff were walking around the premises without face coverings and no risk assessment was available to view, the notice added. Both pubs must remain closed until steps are taken to resolve the issues. As Wales prepares for a 17-day national lockdown, police forces say they will take action against ""those that knowingly go against these restrictions"". Gwent Police's temporary assistant chief constable Ian Roberts said: âWe will be carrying out additional patrols, in particular over the Halloween and Bonfire Night period. âWorking with local businesses and partners, weâll be ensuring that everyone is doing all that they can to help us prevent the continued spread of this virus."" Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford defended his decision-making, following criticism that businesses had been given last-minute details on how
the lockdown would affect them. It follows confirmation yesterday thatsupermarkets remaining open were not allowed to sell ""non-essential"" goodsout of fairness to retailers forced to close. ""We are making decisions
under huge pressure of events and making them as quickly as we can,"" he
said. ""Not every decision can be
made on the first day of a lockdown announcement. ""It's why we gave a whole
week, a working week, from the day we announced the decision to the point at
which it comes into practice. ""We said from the very
beginning that non-essential retail would close in Wales. ""All we are doing is
clarifying that and remaining consistent with that initial decision."" Government communication has been lacking throughout the Covid crisis, according to Plaid Cymru health spokesman Rhun
ap Iorwerth. ""I think
thatâs been the story throughout this pandemic,"" he said. âIâve been arguing on behalf of
businesses in my constituency back in May, June, July, give us plans, give us
an idea of what is ahead. âThis firebreak [in Wales] needs to be a
reset for the way government communicates these messages.â Mr ap Iorwerth added the government was right
to find ways of minimising contact between people during the firebreak. Rhun ap Iorwerth said he had been arguing throughout the summer for firms to be given plans The temporary national lockdown in Wales is ""disproportionate"", says the leader of the Welsh Conservatives' Senedd group. Asked about the controversy over what was classed as essential retail, Paul Davies said: âIt shouldnât have come to this in the first place. âWe believe that introducing this
temporary national lockdown is disproportionate and will actually hit
businesses and hit the economy very, very hard. ""Therefore, in our view, obviously, independent retailers should be allowed to open as well.â Paul Davies says the lockdown will hit the Welsh economy ""very, very hard"" The firebreak lockdown is about âsaving lives not saving
Christmas,â Wales' first minister has said. Mark Drakeford added that the pandemic âwonât be over by
Christmasâ. And he was unable to confirm whether people living in other
parts of the UK would be able to travel to Wales for the festive period. Answering questions at the Welsh Government briefing, Mr Drakeford said: âThere are things
that we can do, and we can do together, to make sure that Christmas of a coronavirus sort can still be celebrated here in Wales."" He added that how that will ""mesh in with the difficulties that are
being faced elsewhere in the United Kingdom"" is impossible to predict. âLet us hope that the measures that are being put in
place elsewhere succeed as well, and then we will all be able to meet with
family, with friends - have some sort of Christmas, in which there is still
something for us all to celebrate,â he said. The
firebreak period in Wales will come to an end on 9 November, but
discussions are underway as to what measures will be put in place after that
period, Wales' first minister said. Mark Drakeford told journalists: âOf course there will be a regime beyond
that [period], coronavirus will not have disappeared because of the actions and
efforts we will make over the next 17 days."" âWe will be working very hard into next week
and with our partners to make sure that we have a regime beyond 9 November, that we share it with people in very good time, for people to know
what that will beâ, he said. ""It's better to take that bit of time and get
the best decisions that we can make, rather than trying to beat a news cycle by
rushing to announce things before they have properly been tested and thought
through.â Wales' first minister has warned that the firebreak lockdown will be ""very tough"". A 17-day lockdown begins at 18:00 this evening, with households banned from mixing and pubs, restaurants and non-essential shops ordered to shut. âThe next two weeks are going to be very tough in
Wales,"" said Mark Drakeford. ""We really are returning to the sort of lockdown people saw back in
March and April. ""It will feel qualitatively different even to the restrictions
that have been in place so far.â First Minister Mark Drakeford said a ""further set of measures"" would be announced today to support those in Wales who fall through the gaps of UK income support schemes. The Welsh Government has asked for the new Job Support Scheme to be brought forward, or furlough restrictions eased, for the length of the lockdown. It warned of redundancies because the new scheme does not start until 1 November, taking over from the existing Job Retention Scheme - also known as the furlough. ""I regret  the fact that the Chancellor was unable to create a single system to help people through that,"" Mr Drakeford said. The decision to prevent supermarkets from selling non-essential good during the firebreak is about âfairnessâ, Wales' first minister has said. Mark Drakeford insisted any suggestion the decision was based on his own political beliefs was ânonsensicalâ. He told the Welsh Government briefing: âThe decision is simply based on the need for fair play. âI'm not prepared to treat small businesses in Wales in one way, requiring them to close - they are not able to earn a living during these two weeks, as part of our national efforts. âAnd then simply because another sector in society are more powerful, are bigger, that they think that they can be treated differently. âIt is a straightforward matter of fairness - we are in this together here in Wales. ""No individual and no organisation is above the effort that we are all required to make.â  Supermarkets say they have been given ""very little time"" to implement changes announced ahead of tonight's firebreak lockdown. A spokesperson for Asda said: 

âThe Welsh Governmentâs firebreak regulations means that we can only sell products they deem to be essential. âWe have been given very little time to implement these changes or clarity on what is deemed âessentialâ."" The store chain expressed ""deep concerns about the implications for customers accessing products they genuinely need and the risk to colleagues' safety"". âWe will continue to do our utmost to keep our customers and colleagues safe and would appeal to our customers to be patient when they shop with us and to continue to treat our colleagues with respect as they do their best to help them understand the new regulations,â said the spokesperson.

"This video can not be played Mixed views on the firebreak in Wales' first local lockdown area Wales' 17-day lockdown will start later, with the first minister saying the priority is about ""saving lives not saving Christmas"". From 18:00 BST people are being told to stay at home, with all but essential businesses closed. Economists have warned the lockdown may cost the economy more than Â£500m and the Conservatives have accused ministers of having ""no exit plan"". But the Welsh Government said any delay would have caused greater harm. Pubs, bars, restaurants and hotels, as well as all non-essential shops will have to close, with people being told only to travel for essential reasons, such as for medical treatment, to buy food and to exercise. The nationwide ""firebreak"", which comes after local lockdowns in communities, aims to slow the rise in Covid cases and hospital admissions. What you need to know about new Covid rules around the UK What are the rules where I live? First Minister Mark Drakeford has reassured the public the ""short, sharp"" lockdown will end as planned on 9 November, with consistent Wales-wide measures coming afterwards. But the Welsh Conservatives and Plaid Cymru have accused the Welsh Government of not having an ""exit strategy"" to end the spread of the virus and restart the economy. At Friday's Welsh Government briefing, First Minister Mark Drakeford said the pandemic would not be over in the coming months but added there were ""things that we can do... to make sure that Christmas of a coronavirus sort can still be celebrated here in Wales"". He added: ""How that will mesh in with the difficulties that are being faced elsewhere in the United Kingdom is just impossible to predict."" The national lockdown brings an end to the local lockdowns imposed on 15 counties, as well as the city of Bangor and town of Llanelli in recent weeks. People can be fined Â£60 for a first coronavirus restrictions offence, up to a maximum fixed penalty notice of Â£1,920. Q&A: What can you do in Wales-wide lockdown? Why has Wales chosen a national lockdown? When would we know a circuit-breaker is working? Primary schools will reopen after next week's half-term break, but only Years 7 and 8 in secondary schools can return at that time under the new rules. It comes as stricter coronavirus rules are coming into force for nearly six million Britons on Friday, including Warrington moving into thehighest level of England's Covid-19 restrictionsalongsideGreater Manchester,LiverpoolCity Region andLancashireafter a surge of Covid-19 cases. Shoppers headed to the high street in Cardiff before stores close tonight Speaking onBBC Radio Wales Breakfast, Health Minister Vaughan Gething said there would be ""greater"" economic harm if the Welsh NHS becomes overwhelmed and there were ""deeper and harder"" measures for a longer period of time. ""If we do this now and if we then have a consistent set of national rules, to keep the transmission and the intensity of the virus at a lower level, then we can have a much more normal Christmas season for businesses,"" he said. ""The month of December is really important for many businesses, if we delayed, we would have almost certainly impacted upon that part of the season."" Dr Margaret Harris, World Health Organization spokeswoman, said people should start planning how to safely celebrate Christmas. ""It will be a new Christmas, but we can enjoy our time together,"" she said. ""We just have to do it slightly apart."" On Friday people enjoyed a drink in Cardiff before bars close at 18:00 But the Welsh Conservatives have accused the Welsh Government of having no plan for what will happen after the Wales-wide lockdown ends. The party's leader in the Senedd Paul Davies said the Welsh Government should be looking at ""hyper-local"" lockdowns rather than imposing a ""damaging"" national lockdown. ""The first minister is taking us into a Wales-wide lockdown without publishing the full data to justify it, the details of what they are going to achieve during the lockdown and now we don't know what the situation is going to be at the end of it,"" he said. ""People are concerned that this second Wales-wide lockdown is just the start of rolling lockdowns over the coming."" Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price said the Welsh Government needed to publish plans on how systems to halt the spread of the virus - including track and trace - would be improved during the next two weeks. ""No-one wants to live in a perpetual state of coming in and out of lockdowns. For the sake of public health and our economy, this break has to be the start of a different approach,"" he said.

The UK's average is between 1.3 and 1.5. Even though Wales has some of the lowest coronavirus infection rates in the UK, First Minister Mark Drakeford said that without this lockdown theWelsh NHS would not be able to cope. The number of patients in hospital in Wales with coronavirus is now the highest since June, according to NHS Wales figures out on Friday. There were 894 people in Welsh hospitals with the virus, up 26% week-on-week, while 43 of them are in critical care, a rise of 72%. This is about two-thirds of the number at the peak. Food shops, off-licences and pharmacies can stay open but supermarkets will beunable to sell items like clothesduring Wales' temporary lockdown and only essential items. Business leaders say companies in Wales have been given just hours to finalise plans for the firebreak. Among those affected was the former winner of the BBC's The Apprentice, Alana Spencer, who was due to open a new cafe on the Aberystwyth sea front on Friday. In atearful social media post,external, she said she was ""gutted"" by the timing and later added it was a ""devastating blow"" to her new business. ""I took to social media and I had a small melt-down,"" she said. Alana Spencer said lockdown was a ""bitter pill to swallow"" in an area with the lowest case rate in Wales However she told BBC Radio Wales she will now use the takeaway service during lockdown to trial new products. ""Luckily we have a hatch on the front so we can do takeaway, so we'll take it from there and open properly at the end of the lockdown,"" she said. ""It's a bitter pill to swallow, when we are in Ceredigion, we have lower numbers and we are being very sensible here, but ultimately people's lives are at risk."" Organisers of an unlicensed rave which attracted 3,000 people in Neath Port Talbot in August were fined Â£10,000 People can be issued a fixed penalty notice ""for most types of breaches"" and fined Â£60 for the first offence. That fine is increased to Â£120 for a second offence and continues to double for repeated offences, up to a maximum of Â£1,920. If prosecuted, however, a court can impose anunlimited fine. Residents of Caerphilly county were the first to go into a local lockdown on 8 September. Key worker Lois Griffiths's son and daughter will continue to go to a childminder as she has to carry on working. Lois Griffiths and daughter Amy are trying to carry on with their lives ""as best they can"" ""I've got to carry on with my life,"" she said. ""We can't just stick in the house and do nothing - we've got to earn money."" Her 10-year-old daughter Amy is disappointed because lockdown means she can't go to her dance class. ""I feel really sad because I've got 'Team' coming up and I don't want to stop doing that,"" she said. Hair stylist Ellen Watkins is worried about the financial impact of the Covid-19 lockdown Unique Creations has been ""chock-a-block"" as people want a pre-lockdown trim before the hair salon on Blackwood High Street closes on Friday evening. ""We're flat out,"" said stylist Ellen Watkins. ""I'm hoping it will be the same when we come back. There's a lot of worry. I'm looking to buy a house.

On Friday, Finance Minister Rebecca Evans announced an extra Â£5m to help small firms retain workers not eligible for the remaining week of furlough, while another Â£5m will be added to the Discretionary Assistance Fund for people waiting for benefits or facing hardship while still working. Non-essential retailers will be told to close for 17 days from Friday Mr Drakeford had said hefeared employees could face redundancyif the Treasury does not change its support for workers. The Welsh Government had asked for the JSS to be brought forward, or furlough restrictions eased, for the length of the lockdown, and offered to pay the cost for the difference between furlough and the JSS, estimated at Â£11m. However the UK government said ministers in Cardiff knew ""full well"" it was not possible for the Treasury, adding the timing of Wales' lockdown was ""very, very unfair"" on people ""caught by the time gap"". The Treasury said the UK government had provided billions in support to Wales. EASY STEPS:How to keep safe A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? TRAVEL PLANS:What are your rights? IN-DEPTH:Coronavirus pandemic The National Institute Of Economic and Social Research says that up-front cost ""must be set against potential economic benefits"" after lockdown if it is successful in reducing the spread of the virus and restoring economic confidence. More than 100,000 people in Wales work in the accommodation and food industries while nearly 200,000 work in the wholesale and retail trades and car repairs. Estate agents have to close and house viewings and valuations have to stop, a blow for the Haus agency which is to open its new Cardiff branch on Friday - only to close for two weeks in the evening. ""It's been such a challenging time,"" said director Chris Birch. ""Everything involved in running a business, let alone moving in a global pandemic, has taken so much longer and the admin and red tape is another level."" Public health officials and politicians have warned they will not know the full impact of the firebreak lockdown until after it ends on 9 November. Giri Shankar, from Public Health Wales, said there was ""always a lag phase of about two to three weeks"" before any visible change of that intervention can be measured and detected"". This video can not be played Wales' first minister said without acting now the NHS would not be able to look after the increasing number of seriously ill people But the first minister has said the lockdown end date is fixed as to avoid further harm to the economy. Wales, though, has been warned of the possibility of another lockdown early in the new year if Covid-19 starts spreading quickly again at Christmas.

"It is Boris Johnson's ""ambition"" for people to celebrate Christmas with their families, his spokesman has said. The prime minister is ""hopeful"" that ""some aspects of our lives"" could be ""back to normal"" by then, he added. But a scientific adviser to the government warned without taking action a normal Christmas was ""wishful thinking in the extreme"". It comes as tougher rules come into force for nearly six million Britons - including a lockdown in Wales. Welsh health minister Vaughan Gething also brought up the prospect of Christmas, saying the 17-day national lockdown, starting at 18:00 BST, was happening now so ""we can have a much more normal Christmas season for businesses"". But Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford saidthe priority was ""saving lives not saving Christmas"". Scots have been warned the idea of a normal Christmas is a ""fiction"" and theyshould prepare for digital celebrations. What Covid tier is your area in? Scotland: New five-tier Covid alert system Wales: Lockdown to start in bid to save Christmas trade Speaking at a briefing for journalists, the No 10 spokesman said: ""The PM has been clear previously that he is hopeful that in many ways we could be able to get some aspects of our lives back to normal by Christmas. ""As I say, we've been clear about the ambition to ensure that people may celebrate Christmas as a family this year."" But earlier, government scientific adviser Prof John Edmunds said the idea that people could ""carry on as we are"" and then have a normal Christmas with friends and family was ""wishful thinking in the extreme"". Prof Edmunds, who sits on the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) committee, said: ""The only way that we can have a relatively safe and normal Christmas is if we take radical action now to reduce incidence - at the very least in high incidence areas - and keep the incidence low across the country by implementing a package of measures to reduce social contacts."" LOCKDOWN LOOK-UP:The rules in your area THREE TIERS:How will the system work? PAY-PACKET SUPPORT:What will I be paid under the new scheme? VACCINE:How close are we to finding one? Prof Edmunds was responding to comments made by government minister Stephen Barclay, who told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he hoped families would be allowed to spend Christmas together. ""I think few people expect it to be exactly as it would normally,"" said Mr Barclay - but ""the ability of families to spend Christmas together"" was ""something we all hope to be in a position to do"". Sir Jeremy Farrar, who also sits on the Sage committee that advises the government,has already warned that Christmaswould be ""tough"" and was unlikely to be the ""usual celebration"" of ""families coming together"". Meanwhile, the UK recorded another 224 deaths and 20,530 new confirmed cases on Friday. The R number for the UK has decreased slightlyand is now estimated to be between 1.2 and 1.4. That means every 10 people with the virus pass it on to 12 or 14 others, on average. Warrington is the latest placeto announce it is moving to England's highest level of restrictions - tier three. The measures will take effect next week. Nottingham and parts of Nottinghamshire are also expected to be moved into tier three next week, with the finer details such as whether or not gyms can stay open stillto be decided. South Yorkshire will also move into tier threefrom 00:01 on Saturday, by which time more than seven million people will be living under England's tightest rules. Greater Manchester, Liverpool City Region and Lancashire are already in tier three. Under tier three rules pubs and bars not serving substantial meals have to close, while household mixing is banned indoors and outdoors in hospitality settings and private gardens. Some areas have also gone further, closing businesses such as bingo halls, casinos, betting shops and soft play centres, while there is guidance against travelling in or out of the area. Rising infections mean Coventry, Stoke and Slough will move intotier two restrictions at 00:01 on Saturday. The high alert level means households are banned from mixing indoors and people are encouraged to reduce their use of public transport. Scotlandis bringing in its own five-tier system of restrictionswhich will come into force from 2 November, with the top level close to a full lockdown. In Wales, the ""firebreak"" means people will have to stay at home and pubs, restaurants, hotels and non-essential shops will close until 9 November.

"Manchester went into tier three - the highest level - of lockdown rules at 00:01 on Friday Stricter coronavirus rules are coming into force for nearly six million Britons. Greater Manchester's population of 2.8 million joined Liverpool City Region and Lancashire in England's highest tier of restrictions at midnight. And from 18:00 BST, the 3.1 million people in Wales will have to stay at home as a 17-day lockdown begins. It comes as a minister said there was a ""common purpose here to get the virus down"" so people could enjoy Christmas. ""I think few people expect it to be exactly as it would normally,"" said Chief Secretary to the Treasury Stephen Barclay - but ""the ability of families to spend Christmas together"" was ""something we all hope to be in a position to do"". Welsh health minister Vaughan Gething said the lockdown in Wales was happening now so ""we can have a much more normal Christmas season for businesses"". The UK recorded another 189 deaths and 21,242 new confirmed cases on Thursday. What Covid tier is your area in and what are the rules? Scotland: Sturgeon to set out five-tier Covid alert system Wales: Lockdown to start in bid to save Christmas trade NI: Half of schools record Covid-19 cases Warrington has become the latest place to be placed into tier three - or ""very high"" alert level. The measures will take effect next week. Nottingham and parts of Nottinghamshire are also expected to be moved into tier three next week, with the finer details such as whether or not gyms can stay open still to be decidedas talks continue. The tier three alert level means people cannot mix with other households and pubs and bars will be closed - unless they are serving substantial meals. Some areas in the top tier have also gone further, closing businesses such as bingo halls, casinos, betting shops and soft play centres. Households are banned from mixing outdoors in private gardens or anywhere inside and people are advised against travelling into or out of the area. South Yorkshire will also move into tier three restrictions from 00:01 on Saturday, by which time more than seven million people will be living under England's tightest rules.

The ""high"" alert level means households are banned from mixing indoors and people are encouraged to reduce their use of public transport. In Wales, the ""firebreak"" means people are being ordered to stay at home and pubs, restaurants, hotels and non-essential shops will close until 9 November. Supermarkets have been told not to sell items such as clothes, as First Minister Mark Drakeford said it would be ""made clear"" they should only open the parts of their business that sell essential goods. This video can not be played Mixed views on the firebreak in Wales' first local lockdown area And the Scottish government is to set outits own tiered alert system of Covid restrictions, which will come into force from 2 November. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said it would have five tiers, with the middle tiers corresponding roughly to England's three, plus a lower tier that is ""the closest to normality"" possible without a vaccine. She said an additional top tier would be ""closer to a full lockdown"" - and was added because England's chief medical officer had acknowledged tier three restrictions were not necessarily enough to reduce infections in all circumstances. LOCKDOWN LOOK-UP:The rules in your area THREE TIERS:How will the system work? PAY-PACKET SUPPORT:What will I be paid under the new scheme? VACCINE:How close are we to finding one? The move in Greater Manchester comes after days of confrontation between local politicians and ministers over the level of financial support the area would receive. After the ""very high"" alert level was imposed, the government announceda more generous wage subsidy scheme, backdated to August, for areas that have been under additional restrictions. Shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds says ministers need to be clearer about how they decide what financial support areas will get and how long this will be for. ""Initially it was suggested there was some kind of a negotiation going on between government and local areas about support for businesses,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""Now it looks like actually there's a formula that's being used by government but they haven't published it anywhere, they've not discussed it, it hasn't been voted on for government.""

"This video can not be played Marcus Rashford and his mother, Melanie, helped out at FareShare Greater Manchester. A growing number of councils in England are promising to provide free meals for children of families facing hardship during the half-term school holidays. Labour-run Birmingham City Council is one of the latest to announce it will supply vouchers - for 61,000 pupils. Tory-run Staffordshire and Kensington and Chelsea will do the same, amid a sustained campaign led by footballer Marcus Rashford. The government has ruled out extending free meals nationwide beyond term time. It said it had given councils Â£63m for families facing financial difficulties due to pandemic restrictions and had increased welfare support by Â£9.3bn. On Wednesday, the House of Commons voted against a Labour call to make free meals available across England - for those normally eligible for them in term time - during holidays for the next six months. Rashford's free meal tweets made into Google map Is there really no money for free school meals? Tory MPs attack celebrity school meal campaigners Andy Street, the Conservative Mayor of the West Midlands, said the government should have made ""a clear decision"" on whether it would or would not fund free school meals during holidays ""well in advance"". Asked if the government should have to pay for half-term meals, he said: ""I think - at the last minute - you probably do have to fund it."" During a visit to a food bank in Manchester with his mother Melanie, Mr Rashford said he would keep pushing the government to change its policy. Reacting to criticism from some MPs, including claims of ""virtue-signalling"", he told BBC Breakfast: ""I'll take that all day long as long as we start to see improvements going forward for the people that are in need of it now. That's what is important to me."" The owner of Castle Beach Cafe in Falmouth will be offering free lunch bags to children who normally get a free school meal. Fiona Crump said she thought she was doing a ""local, small thing"", but was surprised by ""the sheer volume"" of social media shares of her announcement.

Read the full story Mr Rashford, who forced a government U-turn on free school meal vouchers for eligible pupils over the summer holidays, has beenre-tweeting details of councils,externaloffering their own schemes over half-term. Several mainly Labour local authorities have decided to take action themselves. Liverpool Council will pay for the daily lunches of 19,800 children in the city during the half-term break, beginning on Monday, while Redbridge, Hammersmith, Camden and Southwark councils in London will continue to support children eligible for free meals during term time. Greater Manchester's Mayor, Andy Burnham, is offering 1,000 vouchers for children across the region to spend on meals in Co-op stores during half-term. Newcastle City Council is providing packed lunches, while City of York Council, Rochdale Borough Council, Rotherham Council, Kirklees Council, Medway Council, Middlesbrough Council, Bradford Council and Essex County Council are among those promising more help. Conservative-controlled Kensington and Chelsea Council and Staffordshire County Council are promising a Â£15 voucher to the families of as many as 3,300 and 18,000 children respectively for food or essential supplies during the break. More than 200 children's authors and illustrators - including children's laureate Cressida Cowell, Malorie Blackman, Philip Pullman and Frank Cottrell Boyce - have also called for ""organised"" financial help from the government. Their open letter states that ""no child in this nation should go hungry this winter"" because of the pandemic and no family should have to rely on ""pot-luck charity"". A Labour MP, who did not wish to be named, said it was not sustainable for councils to pay for meals over the holidays in the long term and they hoped the government would be ""shamed into action"". Mr Rashford's parliamentary petition calling for free school meals to be extended beyond term time has attracted more than 500,000 signatures. Treasury minister Steve Barclay said all measures would be kept under review but emphasised the extra Â£9bn in support available through the welfare system, including housing allowances and hardship funds for councils. Downing Street said the government's position was ""clear"" and there would be ""no change"" in policy. And a government spokesperson said: ""This government has expanded eligibility for free school meals to more children than any other in decades."" In Scotland, the government has made Â£10m available to local councils to continue to fund free school meals over the Christmas, February and Easter breaks. Local authorities that offered provision over the October school break can apply to be reimbursed. The Welsh government has also pledged to extend free school meal provision to every school holiday until Easter 2021, spending Â£11m.

"British retail sales have continued to increase for the fifth consecutive month, boosted by non-food items including DIY and garden supplies, according to official figures. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said retail sales volumes rose by 1.5% between August and September. Spending on groceries remained high, but petrol sales were still down as motorists made fewer journeys. Sales are now 5.5% higher than the pre-pandemic levels seen in February. The three months to September saw the biggest quarterly increase on record, as retail sales volumes increased by 17.4% when compared with the previous three months. However, analysts warned that the sales surge was unlikely to last, with many parts of the country returning to coronavirus lockdown. New government Covid scheme to pay up to half of wages UK prices rise faster after Eat Out scheme ends ""While food sales have done well in recent months as people have eaten out less, non-food store sales have now made a recovery at 1.7% above their February levels,"" the ONS said. ""Home improvement sales continued to do well in September, with increased sales in household goods and garden items within 'other' non-food stores."" Fuel was the only main sector to remain below February's pre-pandemic level, the ONS said, with volume sales 8.6% lower in September when compared with February 2020. ""As lockdown eased, we saw an increase in travel and the quantity of fuel bought. However, as many people remained working at home and with certain restrictions still in place, fuel sales were yet to fully recover,"" it added. Another positive contribution came from sales of spectacles and contact lenses, the ONS said. ""We gained feedback from opticians in this sector, suggesting that pent-up demand for eye tests and optical wear increased their sales when lockdown measures had eased,"" it added. The proportion of online sales was at 27.5%, compared with 20.1% reported in February. ""There's no doubting that UK consumers have been doing their bit to boost the economy, following a quarter of record retail sales growth,"" said Lynda Petherick, head of retail at Accenture UKI. ""There's little time for retailers to gather breath, though, and they will already be wondering - or perhaps dreading - what lies ahead in Q4. ""This should be a time for excitement as the crucial 'golden quarter' for retail is now underway. However, with lockdown measures across the UK tightening by the day, retailers are braced for a difficult and unconventional end to the year."" One retailer, James Daunt, chief executive of booksellers Waterstones, told the BBC that his stores were ""entering a very unpredictable period of trading"". On the move towards local lockdowns, he said: ""It's had a negative impact, particularly in large metropolitan cities - big city centres, where people use public transport. ""But in local High Streets, [there is] much less impact and in some, not at all."" Further evidence of the impact of local lockdowns on the economy came fromthe latest IHS Markit/CIPS flash UK composite output index,external, which indicated a ""sharp slowdown"" in growth due to a much weaker contribution from the service sector. The index registered 52.9 in October, down from 56.5 in September and August's recent peak of 59.1. Anything above 50 indicates economic expansion. IHS Markit said respondents to its survey had frequently commented on tighter restrictions across the hospitality sector, with service providers as a whole reporting a decline in new business for the first time since June. ""The latest reading pointed to the weakest rise in UK private sector output since a return to growth was first signalled in July,"" it added.

In Scotland, the government has made Â£10m available to local councils to continue to fund free school meals over the Christmas, February and Easter breaks. Local authorities that offered provision over the October school break can apply to be reimbursed. The Welsh government has also pledged to extend free school meal provision to every school holiday until Easter 2021, spending Â£11m.

"Household mixing is banned indoors and most places outdoors under tier three restrictions Warrington will move to England's highest tier of coronavirus restrictions from next week, its council has confirmed. The Labour-run councilsaid it had reached agreement with the government,externaland would be moving into tier three. Local leaders agreed a financial settlement worth Â£5.9m. Conservative MP for Warrington South, Andy Carter, said this was proportionate with the financial settlements for other tier three areas. The Cheshire town, home to about 210,000 people, is the 35th-worst hit place in England according to government figures. As of Monday, the government reported 733 coronavirus cases in Warrington, with a rate of 349 per 100,000 people in the previous seven days. Council leader Russ Bowden said case numbers remained ""stubbornly high"" and ""urgent action"" was needed. Restrictions are expected to come into force at 00:01 GMT on Thursday. What Covid tier is your area in and what are the rules? The council has said people must not: Socialise with anybody you don't live with in any indoor setting, private garden or most outdoor hospitality venues and ticketed events Socialise in a group of more than six in outdoor public spaces such as parks The council said people should: Avoid travelling outside Warrington wherever possible - only essential journeys, such as for work or caring responsibilities, should be made Avoid staying overnight in another part of the UK Under the rules pubs and bars which don't serve substantial meals will close, along with soft play centres, betting offices and casinos. Gyms, leisure centres, hairdressers, beauticians and trampoline parks will stay open. Support bubbles,externalandchildcare bubblesare not affected. Sarah Lott and her husband Paul run family business The Jungle Play Centre in Warrington Sarah Lott, who runs The Jungle soft play centre in Warrington, said she was ""devastated"" and has already had a staff member in tears since the announcement. She said she did not understand why trampoline parks could stay open but soft play could not. ""You can't pinpoint the reason. If the government had scientific advice or told us why. What is the evidence that soft play centres are a pit of germs?"" Ms Lott said. ""We are working at 40% capacity, there is loads of room, adults wear masks and we clean between sessions. There is no issue at all."" Soft play industry 'on brink of collapse' as tier 3 looms She said she has already let two thirds of her staff go and is ""down to the bare minimum"". ""I don't know how we are going to survive. Our rent is over Â£10,000. It is a blow. It is just horrific. Here we go again,"" she added. Rob England, BBC England Data Unit Warrington, like many parts of England, has seen a surge in cases over the last eight weeks, according to government figures. The area recorded 349 cases per 100,000 people in the week to 19 October, well above England's overall rate of 187.4 per 100,000 over the same period, but a slight drop on the previous week so far. It also saw 10 further deaths from coronavirus in the last week and hospital admissions to Warrington and Halton Teaching Hospitals rose by 10 in the seven days to 18 October on the previous week. It's a mixed picture in neighbouring areas. Authorities such as Salford, Wigan and St Helens have seen higher rates, while Halton - already in tier 3 as part of the Liverpool City Region - Cheshire East and Cheshire West all recorded lower rates. Gareth Hammond who runs the Chapel House Inn in Burtonwood said it was a ""blessed relief"" to shut after some ""stressful days"" since being placed in tier two. He had been forced to ""separate friends who had been drinking together for years"", he said, and there had been ""difficult conversations"" with customers who felt there was ""no logic"" behind the rules. Gareth Hammond who runs the Chapel House Inn said it would be a ""relief"" to close after stressful days trying to police tier two rules ""You would have a couple of people who had been working in a van together all day but I had to tell them they could not sit together and have a drink afterwards,"" he said. He also said it had been ""uncomfortable"" as people from other tier three regions had ""flooded"" the Warrington pubs. However, Mr Hammond said, the business could only survive short term by ""scrimping and saving"". If the current restrictions went on for as long as the initial lockdown, he said, it could be ""a different kettle of fish"". He said having to close would be ""difficult to manage"" , but he didn't know how long he could carry on operating under tier two conditions. ""We're making very little money and it is not enjoyable,"" he said. Households will no longer be able to mix outside hospitality venues as they can in tier two Bookmaker Harold Smith, who runs a betting shop, said the move was ""completely misinformed"". ""More people stand outside at the bus stop than come into the shop,"" he said. ""Since they introduced no smoking people don't stay in the shop any more. Any that do are wearing masks."" Punters ""didn't come back"" after the initial lockdown in March, he said, adding: ""we are doing our business on the telephone now"". The council said Â£1.68 m of the funding package would be allocated to supporting its public health response, including testing and enforcement. It said Â£4.2m would be used for business and employment support. Warrington: Â£5.9m, population 210,000 Liverpool City Region: Â£44m, population 1.5 million Lancashire: Â£42m, population 1.5 million Greater Manchester: Â£60m, population 2.8 million Labour MP for Warrington North, Charlotte Nichols, said it was a ""grim inevitability"" that Warrington would be put in tier three. She said the town had ""double the average rate of infection"" among over-60s and its main hospital was ""nearing its ICU capacity"". Ms Nichols said only about 60% of close contacts were being traced due to the ""failing"" system. She also criticised Warrington's financial settlement as being ""not remotely enough"" and said the government's formula for working it out was ""far too rigid"". Warrington will follow Greater Manchester, whichjoined Liverpool City Region and Lancashire in tier threeat midnight. South Yorkshire will move into tier three restrictions from 00:01 on Saturday. Nottingham and parts of Nottinghamshire are also expected to be moved into tier three next week, with the finer details such as whether or not gyms can stay open still to be decidedas talks continue.

"A new five-tier framework of restrictions will come into force from Monday 2 November Different local authorities will be placed into different tiers in the coming days Levels two and three are similar to restrictions already in place in different parts of Scotland The top level would be close to a full lockdown, but the aim is for schools to remain open at all levels First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says there have been ""signs of progress"" in the number of new cases Latest figures show there have been 1,401 new confirmed cases and 18 deaths in the previous 24 hours BBC Scotland News Here's what we learned from today's coronavirus briefing.  That's all from today's live coverage of - and reaction to - the first minister's briefing. Stay safe everyone. A hospitality body has described the government's new financial support package as welcome in the short-term - but ""the equivalent of
being abandoned at sea with only a lifejacket"". The Scottish
Hospitality Group said the current approach was having a ""devastating"" impact on peopleâs lives and livelihoods. And it warned the new tiered system of restrictions would only add to the problem. Spokesman Stephen Montgomery said: ""The industry cannot survive if the
intention is to impose these restrictions indefinitely. ""They (the Scottish government) need to sit down
and work with businesses before it is too late and
save an industry that is the third biggest employer in the country. ""The hospitality industry is still left bearing the brunt
with no scientific, statistical, or medical
evidence for these restrictions."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

A think tank set up to look at helping the tourism sector recover from the coronavirus pandemichas published its recommendations.,external The
Scottish Tourism Recovery Taskforce looked at
what priority rescue measures both the Scottish and UK governments could take to
bolster recovery. Its recommendations include:  The findings will now be considered by the Scottish government. Economy Secretary Fiona Hyslop has revealed the details of grants
available to businesses required to close for Covid reasons. From 2 November,
firms told to close will be eligible for grants every four
weeks for as long as the restrictions last. Based on rateable values, awards
will be for either Â£2,000 or Â£3,000. Businesses which
can remain open, but are directly constrained by the measures, will be eligible
for grants worth Â£1,400 or Â£2,100, again based on rateable value. Ms Hyslop said this support was ""the maximum we can afford under our current powers and the
resources available"". It matches the level of support available in England
for larger businesses and is more generous to smaller businesses.  âThe Chancellor has written a blank cheque for business support grants in England and he must urgently commit to providing Scotland with the funding needed to help our businesses weather this pandemic. Fiona Hyslop MSP, Economy Secretary Douglas FraserScotland business & economy editor Chancellor Rishi Sunak has unveiled increased support for jobs and workers hit by Covid restrictions. But which parts of his announcement apply in Scotland, and will the Scottish government be seeing extra funding for its own schemes? Read our full explainer here. Before the new framework begins on 2 November, businesses need ""as much clarity on restrictions on trading as is possible"", according to the Scottish Chambers of Commerce. The business body welcomed the new strategic framework, saying it gave companies an opportunity to begin reopening the economy, but said the Scottish government must continue publishing evidence-led data alongside restrictions. Chief executive Dr Liz Cameron said: âIt is in the best interests of the people of Scotland that
businesses are trusted to trade in order to avoid the worst outcomes of
widespread joblessness and economic decline. âThe support available for business will be essential as restrictions
continue and we urge governments to ensure it is allocated efficiently and
effectively over the coming weeks and months.""  If you are just joining us this lunchtime, here are the most recent updates from around the UK: Earlier, we reported thatcoronavirus infections across the UK are continuing to rise, according to the latest data from the Office for National Statistics. It's important to also note that new government data shows the reproduction rate of the virus in the UK has fallen slightly. The estimate for the R number is between 1.2 and 1.4, according to data released by the Government Office for Science and the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage). Last week, the R number was between 1.3 and 1.5. R represents the average number of people each Covid-19 positive person goes on to infect. When the figure is above 1, an outbreak can grow exponentially. An R number between 1.2 and 1.4 means that on average every 10 people infected will infect between 12 and 14 other people. Closing non-essential shop in the highest level of restrictions would come with ""very significant economic harms"", the Scottish Retail Consortium has warned. Director David Lonsdale said: ""Retail has demonstrated that it can operate safely
in the current environment and it is notable that there was no spike in
infections following the lifting of lockdown on non-essential shops at the end
of June. âScottish stores lost Â£2.4bn of retail sales over the first seven months of the pandemic and have
yet to claw their way back to pre-crisis levels. Any attempt to close
non-essential stores during the golden Christmas shopping quarter may mean many
are unable to reopen, having missed out on this vital trading period."" Mr Lonsdale added that the government must weigh up the public health advice ""which admits
to the minimal impact on reducing transmission"" against the ""catastrophic effect"" the closure would have on  businesses. There are so many questions that need to be answered about the Scottish government's Covid levels framework, the Scottish Lib Dems have said. Willie
Rennie said his party wanted to be able to support the strategy. However, he said more clarity was needed on what the criteria was for ares to move between levels. He criticised ""open-ended, rolling limits that are so vague that only a small number of people in government HQ can understand"". âThe
Scottish government has got three days to convince people that this strategy has
got hope and clarity at its heart and the ability to lift us safely out of this
second crisis,"" he said. He added that the public
needed certainty that their sacrifices will make a difference and that their freedoms will be returned. Scottish Labour has warned there is a danger of confusion with the new framework. Party leader Richard
Leonard says that with the potential for different areas of the country to be under different regulations, there exists a ""real danger"" people will not understand what restrictions they are under - and for how long - and so putting health at risk. He said that there was a need for the Scottish government to provide clarity
for the public and businesses. Mr Leonard also said it is ""paramount"" that businesses and workers get the support they need.  âThe support for businesses is to be welcomed, but there must be greater support for workers over the coming months. It is of paramount importance that the Scottish and UK governments co-operate to ensure that businesses and workers get the support they need. The new testing strategy is necessary â a more extensive and strengthened track and trace system is desperately needed to get us out of a cycle of continued lockdowns, which are damaging to the economy and peopleâs mental health. Richard Leonard, Leader, Scottish Labour What Level am I in? What does it mean for me? What happens next? If you want to read the full document: Scotland's Strategic Framework, you will find ithere,external. The deputy chief medical officer issues a warning as she says NHS Lanarkshire has seen cases rising. If this happened across the country it would be very concerning, she says, as it would mean that no health boards would have the capacity to help out those neighbouring them. Dr Nicola Steedman said: ""When we see one board with cases rising, if other boards are in the position to provide mutual aid that's great. ""But if we all end up in the same position, then there's no mutual aid to give and that's when we run intothe real risk of the NHS being overwhelmed."" She added that the situation within the NHS Lanarkshire area was not being taken lightly, and that it was a ""warning sign to all of us"" to show what could happen if the spread of the virus was not curtailed. The Scottish government has published details of a new five-tier alert system of Covid-19 restrictions. It will allow the government to impose different restrictions in local areas, depending on the prevalence of the infection. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said it would mean a part of the country with low rates would not have to live with the same restrictions as one with a high rate. Allow Twitter content?

Scottish Tory leader Douglas Ross tells BBC Scotland it is interesting that business leaders are to be consulted on restrictions and financial help and that he has been calling for this for ""a long time"". He says he is concerned the Scottish government seemed to be ""looking for fights"" with the UK government over funding when Â£700m has been made available by Chancellor Rishi Sunak. Mr Ross wants to see that money distributed to businesses as soon as possible. Scotland has got a fair share already with the Â£700m announced two weeks ago.

"This video can not be played Covid in Scotland: What is the five-tier lockdown system? Scotland is to enter a new five-level system of coronavirus restrictions, Nicola Sturgeon has confirmed. The new model will come into force from 2 November, when temporary curbs on the hospitality trade are due to expire. It features five tiers of measures - from ""level zero"" to four - to be applied in different areas of Scotland depending on the spread of the virus. The top level would be close to a full lockdown, but the aim is for schools to remain open at all levels. Restrictions under levels two and three are similar to those which are currently in place for different parts of Scotland. The first minister saidthe new strategy,externalwas about ""striking the best balances we can"" between suppressing the virus and minimising wider harms to businesses and individuals. All you need to know about the UK's new Covid rules How will Scotland's new system work? Coronavirus infections continue to rise across UK Live: Latest on coronavirus in Scotland The move in Scotland comes as tougher restrictions are brought into force formillions of people in England and Wales. Coronavirus cases in Scotland continue to rise, with 1,401 registered on Friday alongside a further 18 deaths. The latest figures from the Office for National Statistics suggestthe virus is spreading across the UK, with 1 in every 180 people in Scotland thought to have been infected in the two weeks to 16 October. Ms Sturgeon said the ban on home visits and the short-term restrictions currently imposed on bars and restaurants in the central belt of the country in particular were beginning to slow the increase in cases. However, she said restrictions would still be needed until a vaccine for the virus was developed, adding: ""Everything we do must be consistent with suppressing Covid as far as we can."" The first minister said there would be talks with opposition parties and representatives of businesses - particularly from the hospitality trade - about the exact details of the different levels. Decisions on which tier each part of Scotland will be placed in will be made alongside local health protection teams in the coming week. Ms Sturgeon has previously said decisions about where levels would be set for each region of Scotland would be taken on a ""collaborative"" basis, but saidshe would ultimately bear accountability for them. The system will come into force from 2 November, following a vote by MSPs, and the application of different levels in different areas will be reviewed on a weekly basis. The first minister said: ""It's possible the whole country at some point could be placed in the same level. But it means we don't have to take a one size fits all approach if that's not warranted. ""A part of the country with low rates of infection won't have to live with the same levels of restrictions as a part of the country with high rates."" Covid-19 in Scotland: Five numbers to watch Half of NI's schools record Covid-19 cases Ms Sturgeon said that while case numbers were still rising across Scotland, there were ""some signs of progress"" in the data. The average number of new cases per day in Scotland has increased by 7% over the past seven days, compared with the previous week. This is down from a 29% increase on average the previous week, and a 52% jump the week before that. Ms Sturgeon said: ""Cases are still rising, which is why we cannot be complacent. But the rate of the increase does seem to be slowing down, which gives us grounds for some cautious optimism."" MSPs will hold a vote on the proposed framework next week A system of grants for businesses hit by closures or restricted trading has also been announced, with payments on a par with those offered in England. Ms Sturgeon said firms in Scotland ""deserve nothing less"", but said she wanted greater guarantees of funding from the Treasury ""as quickly as possible"". Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said Scotland had ""got a fair share"" of UK-wide funding, saying the Scottish government should ""get that funding out to businesses now"". Meanwhile, Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard said it was ""vital there is clarity over what restrictions people are living under and for how long"". The strategic framework comes alongside an expanded testing strategy, which includes a commitment to expand Scotland's testing capacity to 65,000 tests per day by the end of the year. This will include boosting the number of tests that can be processed at the UK government's Lighthouse laboratory in Glasgow, as well as NHS facilities and some smaller commercial ones. New NHS regional hubs are under construction in Grampian, Lothian and Greater Glasgow and Clyde, and are expected to take on all of the daily routine testing done in care homes around Scotland.

"Thumbs up or down? Our voter panel's verdict on how confident they are about the state of the US Two Biden voters. Two Trump voters. Two undecided voters. All from battleground states. We watched the final debate with six voters who will help determine the fate of the nation on 3 November. Our two undecided voters felt the final head-to-head between Donald Trump and Joe Biden was enough to help lock in their vote. As for the rest? The debate simply confirmed their choice for president. Here's what they said. Andrew is an undecided voter leaning toward Joe Biden, but wishes he had other options to choose from. He works in the restaurant industry and has two young children. What moment stood out to you in the debate? At the beginning it looked like they were going to do much better. But Trump seems like he just wants people to like him, it's so pathetic. I questioned it when he said he did more for black people than any other president. He seemed like someone who has such a huge disconnect with reality. Did Trump or Biden do enough to win your vote tonight? Trump appealed to me on only one issue, and I still don't like his personality. I have enough information now. Biden is who I'm going to go for, although he's not my favourite choice. One word to describe Trump and Biden tonight? Trump - incomprehensible; Biden - better. After becoming disillusioned with the left, Eliana now supports the policies of the Republican Party and backs the re-election of Donald Trump. She is the president of her local young Republicans group and a former professional dancer. She won the national television competition So You Think You Can Dance in 2012. What moment stood out to you in the debate? The standout moments are ones that affect me personally. I ended up spending a tremendous amount on Obamacare. Biden said he would get rid of the competition and that ups the price. If your candidate is defeated, what would it mean to you? It's incredible that we live in a country with an election process like we have here. I would stay in the country and be a proud citizen. But the way I live my life would very much change. I would take my assets and put them into real-estate because I don't trust the government. I am for low-regulation and for a free market. One word to describe Trump and Biden tonight? Trump - improvement; Biden - acting. Joe Biden was not Jessica's first choice as Democratic candidate but she will cast her vote for the former vice-president because she likes and respects him a lot. An attorney and self-described ""news junkie"", Jessica admits to feeling exhausted by this election. What moment stood out to you in the debate? When Trump was going on about how Biden wanted everyone to have small windows and how he wants to knock down buildings and rebuild them. It stood out to me because it's so silly and such an obviously false depiction of Biden's climate plan. If your candidate is defeated, what would it mean to you? I think I'll be scared if Donald Trump wins again. Less for myself than for future generations. I don't have children, but I have a niece and a nephew who are black, and I fear for their future. I worry about another four years of Trump being president and of Republicans rolling back civil rights, reproductive rights and climate measures. One word to describe Trump and Biden tonight? Trump - liar; Biden - solid. Lesley was raised in Canada and became a US citizen in 2016. She is an independent, and will vote for Joe Biden. What moment stood out to you in the debate? In general I felt like Trump wasn't answering the questions. The one part that made my eyebrows raise was when he brought up Hillary Clinton. Why can't he get past that and just lead the country? If your candidate is defeated, what would it mean to you? As a black person and an immigrant living in this country - things have shifted so much in the last four years. I literally have fear - for my life and people who look like me - if there's another four years of Trump. One word to describe Trump and Biden tonight? Trump - predictable; Biden - predictable. Noel is a dual UK-US citizen and undecided voter. Before the debate he said he preferred Biden as a person but was more supportive of Trump's policies. What moment stood out in the debate to you? There were two things that really stood out to me. First, when Biden admitted policy mistakes in the past, which is very rare. Trump could probably learn a lesson from that. Second, Biden was completely wrong when he spoke about the minimum wage. Did Trump or Biden do enough to win your vote tonight? The debate did very little to help me. I am leaning more towards Trump after the debate because I didn't like what Biden said about the economy. I don't think Trump really nitpicked Biden's agenda enough. But in the end, Biden seems to want to grow government, which I am personally not in favour of. But is this really the best that America can deliver? One word to describe Trump and Biden tonight? Trump - erratic; Biden - politician. Rom was featured on Tuesday's military veterans panel. He enthusiastically supports the president's re-election. What moment stood out in the debate to you? For the most part, it was a dignified slugfest. The one moment that stood out was when Biden said he was going to give a pathway to 11 million people who are in the US illegally. We've got millions of unemployed Americans and I don't think that's going to sell very well to anybody who listened to the debate that he's giving priority to people here illegally. If your candidate is defeated, what would it mean to you? I will accept the results, however much I may dislike those results, and I will do it in a dignified way. I have family members who are extreme [Democrats] and said in 2016 when Trump won that he was ""not my president"". I will not take that route. I will take a dignified route as distasteful as it may be for me. One word to describe Trump and Biden tonight? Trump - improved; Biden - rehearsed. Reporting by Sam Cabral and Silvia Martelli.

"President Trump and his Democratic rival Joe Biden have faced off in their second and final presidential debate of the election campaign. They traded arguments and accusations on everything from the coronavirus pandemic, to the economy and even the ""caging"" of children of migrants crossing the border from Mexico. Reality Check has unpicked some of the claims. Verdict: Coronavirus is not going away - cases and hospital admissions are rising and deaths remain high. The White House's top infectious disease expert, Dr Anthony Fauci, has disputed the president's assertion that the US is turning a corner, calling the latest statistics ""disturbing"". Around 60,000 new coronavirus cases a day are being reported across the US, up from around 50,000 a day at the start of October,according to the Covid Tracking Project,external. Hospital admissions have also increased by more than 30% since the start of October. Confirmed deaths have remained at around 800 a day through October. Verdict: That's not right. Coronavirus cases are rising in both Republican (red) and Democratic (blue) states. The Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden implied that the rise in infections was centred on Republican run states. Covid-19 cases are rising in more than 40 US states and these include both Republican and Democratic controlled states. North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana and Wisconsin have seen the most coronavirus cases per capita over the last week,according to New York Times.,external The Dakotas are run by Republican governors, but Montana and Wisconsin both have Democratic governors - although all of these states voted for President Trump in 2016. Mr Biden also pointed to spikes in Republican states in the Midwest - but the midwestern state of Illinois, which voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016 and has a Democratic governor, is also experiencing a spike in coronavirus cases. Verdict: This is misleading. The figure is mentioned in a study published by Imperial College London in March in the case of an ""unmitigated epidemic"". But the study describes 2.2 million deaths from Covid-19 in the US not as the ""expected"" number, but instead what would occur ""in the (unlikely) absence of any control measures or spontaneous changes in individual behaviour"". So far, there have been more than 223,000 Covid-19 deaths in the US. Verdict: President Trump may have a plan to do this but he hasn't shared it with the American people. The Affordable Care Act (ACA), passed under President Obama, made it illegal to deny healthcare coverage to people with pre-existing medical conditions. The Trump administration wants to repeal it and now seeks to dismantle the law in the Supreme Court. The president has repeatedly said he would replace the act with something better and protect people with pre-existing conditions, but his plan to do this is yet to be published. In September,President Trump signed an executive order,externalwhich said: ""access to health insurance despite underlying health conditions should be maintained"". But there is no detail about how this will be done or funded. Verdict: He's right about the number of commutations during the Obama administration, but not about the federal prison reduction. About 1,700 inmates had their sentence commuted (or changed to a less severe one) by President Obama and a further 212 received a pardon. But in 2016, the last year Mr Obama and Mr Biden were in office, there were 16,500 fewer inmates in the federal prison system compared to 2009. Verdict: This implies these figures are annual increases - that's not correct. President Trump said he'd been tough on Russia and insisted he'd boosted defence spending by Nato members. Since 2016, European countries and Canada have increased investment in their defence budgets by $130 billion. But this has been over a number of years rather than every year. According to a Nato report: ""By the end of 2020, European Allies and Canada will have spent an extra 130 billion US dollars on defence since 2016. This figure is due to rise to 400 billion by the end of 2024"". Verdict: That's not quite right. After rising in 2017 the trade deficit with China - the gap between imports and exports - fell sharply after 2018, following tariffs imposed by Washington on Chinese goods. It stood at about $308bn in 2019, slightly less than the $310bn in 2016. According to data from the US Census Bureau, the first six months of 2020 saw a $130bn deficit in both goods and services with China - that's $34 billion less than the first half of 2019 and nearly $53 billion less than in the first half of 2018. Verdict: This needs context. It's true that some migrant children were detained in sites with chain fences under President Obama, but the law said they couldn't be held for more than 72 hours. There were heated exchanges over the controversial policy of the Trump administration that led to the separation of children from their parents at the US border. Mr Trump said it was the Obama administration that built ""the cages"" used to hold them. When Barack Obama and Joe Biden were in office, facilities with chain link fencing were built to house the high numbers of unaccompanied children who crossed into the US from Mexico, before they were transferred elsewhere. Jeh Johnson, the head of Homeland Security during the Obama administration referenced this issue in 2019: ""Very clearly, chain link, barriers, partitions, fences, cages, whatever you want to call them, were not invented on January 20, 2017, OK."" (This is the date of President Trump's inauguration). But he said their detention was meant to be temporary, noting that under the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act, children could only be held in those facilities for 72 hours before being transferred to the health authorities. US border: Who decided to separate families? US-Mexico border: Parents of 545 separated children still not found The two candidates sparred over the facilities for detaining migrants under President Obama Verdict: He is right about clean air but not about water. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) says the US currently has the cleanest air on record. Over the past few decades, air quality - a measure of six major pollutants - has improved significantly in the US. On water, however, the US is ranked 26th in the world on sanitation and drinking water, according to Yale University. On this ranking, Finland, Iceland, the Netherlands, Norway, Switzerland and the UK have the cleanest water. Verdict: He has had to clarify previous statements on fracking, although his policy is to oppose new sites on federal lands. President Trump repeated his claim that Joe Biden wants to ban fracking - the controversial process of drilling below ground and using high-pressure water to force out gas. In March 2020, during a Democratic debate, Mr Biden said ""No more â no new fracking."" He later clarified it: ""I said I would not do any new leases on federal lands."" Mr Biden's campaign site says the Democrats would protect ""America's natural treasures by... banning new oil and gas permitting on public lands and waters."" But they are not opposed to fracking in general. A simple guide to the US election US election 2020 polls: Who is ahead - Trump or Biden? What are Trump's and Biden's policies?

"This video can not be played What you missed - the best bits from Trump and Biden's final debate The mute button, or at least the threat of it, seemed to work. In the second presidential debate, Donald Trump and Joe Biden were more restrained. The candidates allowed each other to speak. They used respectful tones. Even when they went on the attack, they did so in a calm, deliberate manner. After a pugnacious first debate, during which Donald Trump's constant interruptions may have cost him support in subsequent opinion polls, the president has very visibly dialled down the volume - and it made him a much more effective debater. This time, the content of what the candidates are saying might be what the American public remembers from the debate - not the chaotic manner in which it was delivered. Once again, Biden largely held up under fire - avoiding the kind of gaffes and stumbles that could have played into Republican attempts to question his age and mental acuity. The Trump campaign will try to make an issue out of Biden's call for a ""transition"" from oil-based energy - a risky thing to throw in at the tail end of the debate. In an era of hybrid cars and energy-efficient homes, however, when even petroleum companies employ similar language, it may not hit Americans as hard as Republicans imagine. Latest updates, reaction and analysis Trump and Biden clash on Covid, climate and race And the winner was... Kristen Welker Why Abraham Lincoln starred in the election debate In the end, the raucous first debate probably will be what the history books remember. And with polls showing most Americans already having made up their minds - and more than 45 million already having voted - the chance that this evening has a lasting impact on the race seems slim. The Trump campaign complained that this debate was supposed to be focused on foreign policy - perhaps allowing the president to tout what he sees as his accomplishments in the Middle East, trade and Syria and go after Biden on his son's business ties to China. Instead, like earlier debates, it started on the coronavirus pandemic - a topic the American public cares most about, polls suggest. Donald Trump, once again touted a vaccine he said would be ready ""in weeks"". He offered personal testimony to the power of the new drugs to treat the disease and boasted that he was now ""immune"". Biden, not surprisingly, went on the attack. He pointed out Trump had repeatedly promised the disease would disappear on its own. He said there were 220,000 Americans dead and there could be another 200,000 by the end of the year. This video can not be played Trump and Biden clash over the US response to Covid In the back and forth between the two candidates, Trump continued to offer hope that things were getting better and businesses and schools should reopen. And when Trump said that people were ""learning to live"" with the disease, Biden pounced. ""People are learning to live with it?"" he asked. ""People are learning to die with it."" At one point, Trump offered an answer that he said was ""perhaps just to finish this"". The president, clearly, was eager move on to different subjects. Trump telegraphed early and often that he would make Biden's son Hunter a topic of the debate, and it wasn't long before the president brought up the former vice-president's family. He alleged that Biden personally profited from his son's business dealings in Ukraine and China, citing recent news stories based on information allegedly gleaned from Hunter Biden's laptop computer. Biden's defence was a blanket denial, followed by changing the subject to Trump's taxes and business ties to China. That forced the president to spend time explaining about how he really ""pre-paid"" millions of dollars in taxes and again saying he'd someday release his tax returns. The exchange, which would require paragraphs to explain in any sufficient detail, probably left the casual American viewer confused. Trump was counting on drawing blood with his attacks on Biden's family, making this into a controversy that finally pulls his front-running opponent back to earth. Chances are this night won't do that. What was Hunter Biden doing in Ukraine and China Four years ago, Trump rode a hard line on immigration to the Republican nomination and, ultimately, the White House. When the topic came up in Thursday night's debate, however, he tried to downplay some of the more extreme steps he's taken while in office. This video can not be played Trump says catch and release policy only works on immigrants with 'lowest IQs' When asked about his administration's policy of separating the children from the parents of undocumented migrants, for instance, Trump tried to turn the conversation to the detention facilities - ""cages,"" in Trump's term - created by the Obama administration to house unaccompanied minor immigrants. Biden, flashing indignation, noted that the children Trump was detaining came over with their parents and that the policy was making the US a ""laughing stock"". For many American voters, the audio of separated children crying for their parents may still be relatively fresh in their minds. Trump's response, that those children were ""so well taken care of,"" in ""facilities that are so clean"" probably didn't help his cause. Did Trump stop more people coming to US? In the first presidential debate, Trump talked himself into trouble when the topic turned to race relations, as he danced around whether to directly condemn white supremacist groups. This time around, the president was considerably more nimble. He boasted about his cross-party criminal justice reform and funding for historically black colleges. He attacked Biden for his sponsorship of a draconian crime bill in the 1990s that led to a sharp rise in the number of black Americans in prisons. And, perhaps most potently, when Biden began talking about his proposals for reform, he questioned why the former vice-president didn't accomplish more when he served with President Barack Obama. ""It's all talk but no action with these politicians,"" Trump said. ""Why didn't you get it done? You had eight years to get it done."" Anyone who lived through the ""tough on crime"" 1990s in the US would probably be shocked by this debate exchange, where both candidates talked about the number of felons to whom they gave clemency and their efforts at reducing the number of incarcerated Americans. As the mass demonstrations against institutional racism demonstrated earlier this year, the times have indeed changed. A simple guide to the US election How is Donald Trump doing in the polls?

"A new five-tier framework of restrictions will come into force from Monday 2 November Different local authorities will be placed into different tiers in the coming days Levels two and three are similar to restrictions already in place in different parts of Scotland The top level would be close to a full lockdown, but the aim is for schools to remain open at all levels First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says there have been ""signs of progress"" in the number of new cases Latest figures show there have been 1,401 new confirmed cases and 18 deaths in the previous 24 hours BBC Scotland News Here's what we learned from today's coronavirus briefing.  That's all from today's live coverage of - and reaction to - the first minister's briefing. Stay safe everyone. A hospitality body has described the government's new financial support package as welcome in the short-term - but ""the equivalent of
being abandoned at sea with only a lifejacket"". The Scottish
Hospitality Group said the current approach was having a ""devastating"" impact on peopleâs lives and livelihoods. And it warned the new tiered system of restrictions would only add to the problem. Spokesman Stephen Montgomery said: ""The industry cannot survive if the
intention is to impose these restrictions indefinitely. ""They (the Scottish government) need to sit down
and work with businesses before it is too late and
save an industry that is the third biggest employer in the country. ""The hospitality industry is still left bearing the brunt
with no scientific, statistical, or medical
evidence for these restrictions."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

A think tank set up to look at helping the tourism sector recover from the coronavirus pandemichas published its recommendations.,external The
Scottish Tourism Recovery Taskforce looked at
what priority rescue measures both the Scottish and UK governments could take to
bolster recovery. Its recommendations include:  The findings will now be considered by the Scottish government. Economy Secretary Fiona Hyslop has revealed the details of grants
available to businesses required to close for Covid reasons. From 2 November,
firms told to close will be eligible for grants every four
weeks for as long as the restrictions last. Based on rateable values, awards
will be for either Â£2,000 or Â£3,000. Businesses which
can remain open, but are directly constrained by the measures, will be eligible
for grants worth Â£1,400 or Â£2,100, again based on rateable value. Ms Hyslop said this support was ""the maximum we can afford under our current powers and the
resources available"". It matches the level of support available in England
for larger businesses and is more generous to smaller businesses.  âThe Chancellor has written a blank cheque for business support grants in England and he must urgently commit to providing Scotland with the funding needed to help our businesses weather this pandemic. Fiona Hyslop MSP, Economy Secretary Douglas FraserScotland business & economy editor Chancellor Rishi Sunak has unveiled increased support for jobs and workers hit by Covid restrictions. But which parts of his announcement apply in Scotland, and will the Scottish government be seeing extra funding for its own schemes? Read our full explainer here. Before the new framework begins on 2 November, businesses need ""as much clarity on restrictions on trading as is possible"", according to the Scottish Chambers of Commerce. The business body welcomed the new strategic framework, saying it gave companies an opportunity to begin reopening the economy, but said the Scottish government must continue publishing evidence-led data alongside restrictions. Chief executive Dr Liz Cameron said: âIt is in the best interests of the people of Scotland that
businesses are trusted to trade in order to avoid the worst outcomes of
widespread joblessness and economic decline. âThe support available for business will be essential as restrictions
continue and we urge governments to ensure it is allocated efficiently and
effectively over the coming weeks and months.""  If you are just joining us this lunchtime, here are the most recent updates from around the UK: Earlier, we reported thatcoronavirus infections across the UK are continuing to rise, according to the latest data from the Office for National Statistics. It's important to also note that new government data shows the reproduction rate of the virus in the UK has fallen slightly. The estimate for the R number is between 1.2 and 1.4, according to data released by the Government Office for Science and the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage). Last week, the R number was between 1.3 and 1.5. R represents the average number of people each Covid-19 positive person goes on to infect. When the figure is above 1, an outbreak can grow exponentially. An R number between 1.2 and 1.4 means that on average every 10 people infected will infect between 12 and 14 other people. Closing non-essential shop in the highest level of restrictions would come with ""very significant economic harms"", the Scottish Retail Consortium has warned. Director David Lonsdale said: ""Retail has demonstrated that it can operate safely
in the current environment and it is notable that there was no spike in
infections following the lifting of lockdown on non-essential shops at the end
of June. âScottish stores lost Â£2.4bn of retail sales over the first seven months of the pandemic and have
yet to claw their way back to pre-crisis levels. Any attempt to close
non-essential stores during the golden Christmas shopping quarter may mean many
are unable to reopen, having missed out on this vital trading period."" Mr Lonsdale added that the government must weigh up the public health advice ""which admits
to the minimal impact on reducing transmission"" against the ""catastrophic effect"" the closure would have on  businesses. There are so many questions that need to be answered about the Scottish government's Covid levels framework, the Scottish Lib Dems have said. Willie
Rennie said his party wanted to be able to support the strategy. However, he said more clarity was needed on what the criteria was for ares to move between levels. He criticised ""open-ended, rolling limits that are so vague that only a small number of people in government HQ can understand"". âThe
Scottish government has got three days to convince people that this strategy has
got hope and clarity at its heart and the ability to lift us safely out of this
second crisis,"" he said. He added that the public
needed certainty that their sacrifices will make a difference and that their freedoms will be returned. Scottish Labour has warned there is a danger of confusion with the new framework. Party leader Richard
Leonard says that with the potential for different areas of the country to be under different regulations, there exists a ""real danger"" people will not understand what restrictions they are under - and for how long - and so putting health at risk. He said that there was a need for the Scottish government to provide clarity
for the public and businesses. Mr Leonard also said it is ""paramount"" that businesses and workers get the support they need.  âThe support for businesses is to be welcomed, but there must be greater support for workers over the coming months. It is of paramount importance that the Scottish and UK governments co-operate to ensure that businesses and workers get the support they need. The new testing strategy is necessary â a more extensive and strengthened track and trace system is desperately needed to get us out of a cycle of continued lockdowns, which are damaging to the economy and peopleâs mental health.

The deputy chief medical officer issues a warning as she says NHS Lanarkshire has seen cases rising. If this happened across the country it would be very concerning, she says, as it would mean that no health boards would have the capacity to help out those neighbouring them. Dr Nicola Steedman said: ""When we see one board with cases rising, if other boards are in the position to provide mutual aid that's great. ""But if we all end up in the same position, then there's no mutual aid to give and that's when we run intothe real risk of the NHS being overwhelmed."" She added that the situation within the NHS Lanarkshire area was not being taken lightly, and that it was a ""warning sign to all of us"" to show what could happen if the spread of the virus was not curtailed. The Scottish government has published details of a new five-tier alert system of Covid-19 restrictions. It will allow the government to impose different restrictions in local areas, depending on the prevalence of the infection. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said it would mean a part of the country with low rates would not have to live with the same restrictions as one with a high rate. Allow Twitter content?

Scottish Tory leader Douglas Ross tells BBC Scotland it is interesting that business leaders are to be consulted on restrictions and financial help and that he has been calling for this for ""a long time"".

"Manchester went into tier three - the highest level - of lockdown rules at 00:01 on Friday Stricter coronavirus rules are coming into force for nearly six million Britons. Greater Manchester's population of 2.8 million joined Liverpool City Region and Lancashire in England's highest tier of restrictions at midnight. And from 18:00 BST, the 3.1 million people in Wales will have to stay at home as a 17-day lockdown begins. It comes as a minister said there was a ""common purpose here to get the virus down"" so people could enjoy Christmas. ""I think few people expect it to be exactly as it would normally,"" said Chief Secretary to the Treasury Stephen Barclay - but ""the ability of families to spend Christmas together"" was ""something we all hope to be in a position to do"". Welsh health minister Vaughan Gething said the lockdown in Wales was happening now so ""we can have a much more normal Christmas season for businesses"". The UK recorded another 189 deaths and 21,242 new confirmed cases on Thursday. What Covid tier is your area in and what are the rules? Scotland: Sturgeon to set out five-tier Covid alert system Wales: Lockdown to start in bid to save Christmas trade NI: Half of schools record Covid-19 cases Warrington has become the latest place to be placed into tier three - or ""very high"" alert level. The measures will take effect next week. Nottingham and parts of Nottinghamshire are also expected to be moved into tier three next week, with the finer details such as whether or not gyms can stay open still to be decidedas talks continue. The tier three alert level means people cannot mix with other households and pubs and bars will be closed - unless they are serving substantial meals. Some areas in the top tier have also gone further, closing businesses such as bingo halls, casinos, betting shops and soft play centres. Households are banned from mixing outdoors in private gardens or anywhere inside and people are advised against travelling into or out of the area. South Yorkshire will also move into tier three restrictions from 00:01 on Saturday, by which time more than seven million people will be living under England's tightest rules. Rising infections mean that Coventry, Stoke and Slough will move intotier two restrictions at 00:01 on Saturday. The ""high"" alert level means households are banned from mixing indoors and people are encouraged to reduce their use of public transport. In Wales, the ""firebreak"" means people are being ordered to stay at home and pubs, restaurants, hotels and non-essential shops will close until 9 November. Supermarkets have been told not to sell items such as clothes, as First Minister Mark Drakeford said it would be ""made clear"" they should only open the parts of their business that sell essential goods. This video can not be played Mixed views on the firebreak in Wales' first local lockdown area And the Scottish government is to set outits own tiered alert system of Covid restrictions, which will come into force from 2 November. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said it would have five tiers, with the middle tiers corresponding roughly to England's three, plus a lower tier that is ""the closest to normality"" possible without a vaccine. She said an additional top tier would be ""closer to a full lockdown"" - and was added because England's chief medical officer had acknowledged tier three restrictions were not necessarily enough to reduce infections in all circumstances. LOCKDOWN LOOK-UP:The rules in your area THREE TIERS:How will the system work? PAY-PACKET SUPPORT:What will I be paid under the new scheme? VACCINE:How close are we to finding one? The move in Greater Manchester comes after days of confrontation between local politicians and ministers over the level of financial support the area would receive. After the ""very high"" alert level was imposed, the government announceda more generous wage subsidy scheme, backdated to August, for areas that have been under additional restrictions. Shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds says ministers need to be clearer about how they decide what financial support areas will get and how long this will be for. ""Initially it was suggested there was some kind of a negotiation going on between government and local areas about support for businesses,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""Now it looks like actually there's a formula that's being used by government but they haven't published it anywhere, they've not discussed it, it hasn't been voted on for government.""

"Wales is preparing for a 17-day national lockdown from 18:00 BST tonight with pubs, restaurants and non-essential retail closing People are asked to stay at home and only go out if absolutely necessary First Minister Mark Drakeford says the order for supermarkets not to sell non-essential goods is to ensure fairness to traders forced to close Catherine Evans and Andy Roberts That's all from today's live page - thank you for joining us for
the latest developments on the coronavirus outbreak in Wales. Our latest stories are:  Until our next live blog, we'll keep you updated via the BBC News website and our social media channels. Have a good evening - stay safe and well.  Analysis of thousands of swab results means it has been estimated that 16,700 people in Wales had coronavirus in the week ending 16 October. The Office for National Statistics undertakes its own infection survey across the UK. It estimates that about0.55% or one in 180 people, had the virus in Wales.,external This is 8,800 more people than estimated in the previous week. Over a six-week period, it asked 13,270 people in Wales for nose or throat swabs. It tested the results and found 43 positive results, from 33 people from 25 households. In England, ONS estimated that one in 130 were infected; positivity rates are higher than 1% in three regions, north west and north east England and Yorkshire and Humberside. Another 13 Covid-related deaths have been confirmed in Wales, taking the total since the pandemic began to 1,756. Five of these deaths were in the Betsi Cadwaladr health board area of north Wales, which has the highest total. There were three more deaths in Cwm Taf in south Wales, two in Hywel Dda in west Wales, two in Swansea Bay, and one in the Aneurin Bevan board area of south east Wales. Thirteen more people have died with coronavirus in Wales, according to Public Health Wales. This brings the total number of deaths since the pandemic began to 1,756. There were 761 new cases reported today. The total number of confirmed cases in Wales is 40,253. This video can not be played Crowds of revellers made it one final party night before the firebreak lockdown spells last orders for Wales. Cardiff's city centre streets swelled on Thursday night ahead of the two-week national shutdown that will see pubs and clubs closed. Despite the 22:00 curfew for serving alcohol, areas such as St Mary Street and Mill Lane were filled as the party atmosphere carried on to the streets. But from 18:00 BST on Friday, venues will have to shut as everyone in Wales is told: ""Stay at home"". The number of patients in
hospital in Wales with coronavirus is now the highest since June and up to two-thirds the numbers seen during the pandemicâs peak. According to the latest figures
from NHS Wales Informatics:     Local Covid-19 spikes can be detected in waste water, a pilot scheme has found. The
  programme, launched in June, is now monitoring 20 sewage systems across Wales and
  covers 80% of the Welsh population. It could act as an early warning sign of local peaks in coronavirus. However, the World Health Organisation says there
  is no evidence that coronavirus is spread via sewage systems.  If
there are ""genuine cases of people who cannot find something that is
essential to them in a supermarket"" there will be ""other ways in
which that problem can be solved,"" Wales' first minister has said. Mark Drakeford said: ""People are very inventive. ""They have friends, they
have neighbours, who are in a Welsh context, we know, very often very willing
to help. ""There are online ways that
people can purchase goods. ""It is not a problem
without a solution."" First Minister Mark Drakeford has been explaining why supermarkets are not allowed to sell non-essential goods during Wales's national lockdown which begins tonight. He said it was ""a simple matter of fair play"" to the ""many hundreds"" of small stores who stock those goods who are being forced to close for the next 17 days. Local Democracy Reporting Service Two pubs in the south Wales valleys are among the latest to have been ordered to close for not following coronavirus rules. The closure order for the Rock Inn, Aberaman, said customers were allowed to complete their own track-and-trace details resulting in fictitious
names being left, as well as possible data protection breaches and risk of virus transmission. The notice also said the premises were crowded and with customers standing in small groups with drinks and not social distancing. Meanwhile the Tynte Hotel in Abercynon has also been told to close after police were called in response to reports of large numbers of people there. Body camera footage showed severe breaches of overcrowding, a lack of social distancing and bar service being undertaken, according to Rhondda Cynon Taf council. The notice also said that names and phone numbers in the track-and-trace record book did not accurately reflect the number of people police found at the premises. Customers and staff were walking around the premises without face coverings and no risk assessment was available to view, the notice added. Both pubs must remain closed until steps are taken to resolve the issues. As Wales prepares for a 17-day national lockdown, police forces say they will take action against ""those that knowingly go against these restrictions"". Gwent Police's temporary assistant chief constable Ian Roberts said: âWe will be carrying out additional patrols, in particular over the Halloween and Bonfire Night period. âWorking with local businesses and partners, weâll be ensuring that everyone is doing all that they can to help us prevent the continued spread of this virus."" Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford defended his decision-making, following criticism that businesses had been given last-minute details on how
the lockdown would affect them. It follows confirmation yesterday thatsupermarkets remaining open were not allowed to sell ""non-essential"" goodsout of fairness to retailers forced to close. ""We are making decisions
under huge pressure of events and making them as quickly as we can,"" he
said. ""Not every decision can be
made on the first day of a lockdown announcement. ""It's why we gave a whole
week, a working week, from the day we announced the decision to the point at
which it comes into practice. ""We said from the very
beginning that non-essential retail would close in Wales. ""All we are doing is
clarifying that and remaining consistent with that initial decision."" Government communication has been lacking throughout the Covid crisis, according to Plaid Cymru health spokesman Rhun
ap Iorwerth. ""I think
thatâs been the story throughout this pandemic,"" he said. âIâve been arguing on behalf of
businesses in my constituency back in May, June, July, give us plans, give us
an idea of what is ahead. âThis firebreak [in Wales] needs to be a
reset for the way government communicates these messages.â Mr ap Iorwerth added the government was right
to find ways of minimising contact between people during the firebreak. Rhun ap Iorwerth said he had been arguing throughout the summer for firms to be given plans The temporary national lockdown in Wales is ""disproportionate"", says the leader of the Welsh Conservatives' Senedd group. Asked about the controversy over what was classed as essential retail, Paul Davies said: âIt shouldnât have come to this in the first place. âWe believe that introducing this
temporary national lockdown is disproportionate and will actually hit
businesses and hit the economy very, very hard. ""Therefore, in our view, obviously, independent retailers should be allowed to open as well.â Paul Davies says the lockdown will hit the Welsh economy ""very, very hard"" The firebreak lockdown is about âsaving lives not saving
Christmas,â Wales' first minister has said. Mark Drakeford added that the pandemic âwonât be over by
Christmasâ. And he was unable to confirm whether people living in other
parts of the UK would be able to travel to Wales for the festive period. Answering questions at the Welsh Government briefing, Mr Drakeford said: âThere are things
that we can do, and we can do together, to make sure that Christmas of a coronavirus sort can still be celebrated here in Wales."" He added that how that will ""mesh in with the difficulties that are
being faced elsewhere in the United Kingdom"" is impossible to predict. âLet us hope that the measures that are being put in
place elsewhere succeed as well, and then we will all be able to meet with
family, with friends - have some sort of Christmas, in which there is still
something for us all to celebrate,â he said. The
firebreak period in Wales will come to an end on 9 November, but
discussions are underway as to what measures will be put in place after that
period, Wales' first minister said. Mark Drakeford told journalists: âOf course there will be a regime beyond
that [period], coronavirus will not have disappeared because of the actions and
efforts we will make over the next 17 days."" âWe will be working very hard into next week
and with our partners to make sure that we have a regime beyond 9 November, that we share it with people in very good time, for people to know
what that will beâ, he said. ""It's better to take that bit of time and get
the best decisions that we can make, rather than trying to beat a news cycle by
rushing to announce things before they have properly been tested and thought
through.â Wales' first minister has warned that the firebreak lockdown will be ""very tough"". A 17-day lockdown begins at 18:00 this evening, with households banned from mixing and pubs, restaurants and non-essential shops ordered to shut. âThe next two weeks are going to be very tough in
Wales,"" said Mark Drakeford. ""We really are returning to the sort of lockdown people saw back in
March and April. ""It will feel qualitatively different even to the restrictions
that have been in place so far.â First Minister Mark Drakeford said a ""further set of measures"" would be announced today to support those in Wales who fall through the gaps of UK income support schemes. The Welsh Government has asked for the new Job Support Scheme to be brought forward, or furlough restrictions eased, for the length of the lockdown. It warned of redundancies because the new scheme does not start until 1 November, taking over from the existing Job Retention Scheme - also known as the furlough. ""I regret  the fact that the Chancellor was unable to create a single system to help people through that,"" Mr Drakeford said. The decision to prevent supermarkets from selling non-essential good during the firebreak is about âfairnessâ, Wales' first minister has said. Mark Drakeford insisted any suggestion the decision was based on his own political beliefs was ânonsensicalâ. He told the Welsh Government briefing: âThe decision is simply based on the need for fair play. âI'm not prepared to treat small businesses in Wales in one way, requiring them to close - they are not able to earn a living during these two weeks, as part of our national efforts. âAnd then simply because another sector in society are more powerful, are bigger, that they think that they can be treated differently. âIt is a straightforward matter of fairness - we are in this together here in Wales. ""No individual and no organisation is above the effort that we are all required to make.â  Supermarkets say they have been given ""very little time"" to implement changes announced ahead of tonight's firebreak lockdown. A spokesperson for Asda said: 

âThe Welsh Governmentâs firebreak regulations means that we can only sell products they deem to be essential. âWe have been given very little time to implement these changes or clarity on what is deemed âessentialâ."" The store chain expressed ""deep concerns about the implications for customers accessing products they genuinely need and the risk to colleagues' safety"". âWe will continue to do our utmost to keep our customers and colleagues safe and would appeal to our customers to be patient when they shop with us and to continue to treat our colleagues with respect as they do their best to help them understand the new regulations,â said the spokesperson. Non-essential goods have been covered up at Asda stores including Coryton in Cardiff Â© 2025 BBC.

"Manchester went into tier three - the highest level - of lockdown rules at 00:01 on Friday Stricter coronavirus rules are coming into force for nearly six million Britons. Greater Manchester's population of 2.8 million joined Liverpool City Region and Lancashire in England's highest tier of restrictions at midnight. And from 18:00 BST, the 3.1 million people in Wales will have to stay at home as a 17-day lockdown begins. It comes as a minister said there was a ""common purpose here to get the virus down"" so people could enjoy Christmas. ""I think few people expect it to be exactly as it would normally,"" said Chief Secretary to the Treasury Stephen Barclay - but ""the ability of families to spend Christmas together"" was ""something we all hope to be in a position to do"". Welsh health minister Vaughan Gething said the lockdown in Wales was happening now so ""we can have a much more normal Christmas season for businesses"". The UK recorded another 189 deaths and 21,242 new confirmed cases on Thursday. What Covid tier is your area in and what are the rules? Scotland: Sturgeon to set out five-tier Covid alert system Wales: Lockdown to start in bid to save Christmas trade NI: Half of schools record Covid-19 cases Warrington has become the latest place to be placed into tier three - or ""very high"" alert level. The measures will take effect next week. Nottingham and parts of Nottinghamshire are also expected to be moved into tier three next week, with the finer details such as whether or not gyms can stay open still to be decidedas talks continue. The tier three alert level means people cannot mix with other households and pubs and bars will be closed - unless they are serving substantial meals. Some areas in the top tier have also gone further, closing businesses such as bingo halls, casinos, betting shops and soft play centres. Households are banned from mixing outdoors in private gardens or anywhere inside and people are advised against travelling into or out of the area. South Yorkshire will also move into tier three restrictions from 00:01 on Saturday, by which time more than seven million people will be living under England's tightest rules. Rising infections mean that Coventry, Stoke and Slough will move intotier two restrictions at 00:01 on Saturday. The ""high"" alert level means households are banned from mixing indoors and people are encouraged to reduce their use of public transport. In Wales, the ""firebreak"" means people are being ordered to stay at home and pubs, restaurants, hotels and non-essential shops will close until 9 November. Supermarkets have been told not to sell items such as clothes, as First Minister Mark Drakeford said it would be ""made clear"" they should only open the parts of their business that sell essential goods. This video can not be played Mixed views on the firebreak in Wales' first local lockdown area And the Scottish government is to set outits own tiered alert system of Covid restrictions, which will come into force from 2 November. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said it would have five tiers, with the middle tiers corresponding roughly to England's three, plus a lower tier that is ""the closest to normality"" possible without a vaccine. She said an additional top tier would be ""closer to a full lockdown"" - and was added because England's chief medical officer had acknowledged tier three restrictions were not necessarily enough to reduce infections in all circumstances. LOCKDOWN LOOK-UP:The rules in your area THREE TIERS:How will the system work? PAY-PACKET SUPPORT:What will I be paid under the new scheme? VACCINE:How close are we to finding one? The move in Greater Manchester comes after days of confrontation between local politicians and ministers over the level of financial support the area would receive. After the ""very high"" alert level was imposed, the government announceda more generous wage subsidy scheme, backdated to August, for areas that have been under additional restrictions. Shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds says ministers need to be clearer about how they decide what financial support areas will get and how long this will be for. ""Initially it was suggested there was some kind of a negotiation going on between government and local areas about support for businesses,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""Now it looks like actually there's a formula that's being used by government but they haven't published it anywhere, they've not discussed it, it hasn't been voted on for government.""

"This video can not be played Marcus Rashford and his mother, Melanie, helped out at FareShare Greater Manchester. A growing number of councils in England are promising to provide free meals for children of families facing hardship during the half-term school holidays. Labour-run Birmingham City Council is one of the latest to announce it will supply vouchers - for 61,000 pupils. Tory-run Staffordshire and Kensington and Chelsea will do the same, amid a sustained campaign led by footballer Marcus Rashford. The government has ruled out extending free meals nationwide beyond term time. It said it had given councils Â£63m for families facing financial difficulties due to pandemic restrictions and had increased welfare support by Â£9.3bn. On Wednesday, the House of Commons voted against a Labour call to make free meals available across England - for those normally eligible for them in term time - during holidays for the next six months. Rashford's free meal tweets made into Google map Is there really no money for free school meals? Tory MPs attack celebrity school meal campaigners Andy Street, the Conservative Mayor of the West Midlands, said the government should have made ""a clear decision"" on whether it would or would not fund free school meals during holidays ""well in advance"". Asked if the government should have to pay for half-term meals, he said: ""I think - at the last minute - you probably do have to fund it."" During a visit to a food bank in Manchester with his mother Melanie, Mr Rashford said he would keep pushing the government to change its policy. Reacting to criticism from some MPs, including claims of ""virtue-signalling"", he told BBC Breakfast: ""I'll take that all day long as long as we start to see improvements going forward for the people that are in need of it now. That's what is important to me."" The owner of Castle Beach Cafe in Falmouth will be offering free lunch bags to children who normally get a free school meal. Fiona Crump said she thought she was doing a ""local, small thing"", but was surprised by ""the sheer volume"" of social media shares of her announcement. ""It reminds you in times of doom and gloom that the vast majority of people are delightful, helpful, caring people and the world needs to be reminded of that."" Read the full story Mr Rashford, who forced a government U-turn on free school meal vouchers for eligible pupils over the summer holidays, has beenre-tweeting details of councils,externaloffering their own schemes over half-term. Several mainly Labour local authorities have decided to take action themselves. Liverpool Council will pay for the daily lunches of 19,800 children in the city during the half-term break, beginning on Monday, while Redbridge, Hammersmith, Camden and Southwark councils in London will continue to support children eligible for free meals during term time. Greater Manchester's Mayor, Andy Burnham, is offering 1,000 vouchers for children across the region to spend on meals in Co-op stores during half-term. Newcastle City Council is providing packed lunches, while City of York Council, Rochdale Borough Council, Rotherham Council, Kirklees Council, Medway Council, Middlesbrough Council, Bradford Council and Essex County Council are among those promising more help. Conservative-controlled Kensington and Chelsea Council and Staffordshire County Council are promising a Â£15 voucher to the families of as many as 3,300 and 18,000 children respectively for food or essential supplies during the break. More than 200 children's authors and illustrators - including children's laureate Cressida Cowell, Malorie Blackman, Philip Pullman and Frank Cottrell Boyce - have also called for ""organised"" financial help from the government. Their open letter states that ""no child in this nation should go hungry this winter"" because of the pandemic and no family should have to rely on ""pot-luck charity"". A Labour MP, who did not wish to be named, said it was not sustainable for councils to pay for meals over the holidays in the long term and they hoped the government would be ""shamed into action"". Mr Rashford's parliamentary petition calling for free school meals to be extended beyond term time has attracted more than 500,000 signatures. Treasury minister Steve Barclay said all measures would be kept under review but emphasised the extra Â£9bn in support available through the welfare system, including housing allowances and hardship funds for councils. Downing Street said the government's position was ""clear"" and there would be ""no change"" in policy. And a government spokesperson said: ""This government has expanded eligibility for free school meals to more children than any other in decades."" In Scotland, the government has made Â£10m available to local councils to continue to fund free school meals over the Christmas, February and Easter breaks. Local authorities that offered provision over the October school break can apply to be reimbursed. The Welsh government has also pledged to extend free school meal provision to every school holiday until Easter 2021, spending Â£11m. In Northern Ireland, the scheme will run over the half-term break.

"This video can not be played Mixed views on the firebreak in Wales' first local lockdown area Wales' 17-day lockdown will start later, with the first minister saying the priority is about ""saving lives not saving Christmas"". From 18:00 BST people are being told to stay at home, with all but essential businesses closed. Economists have warned the lockdown may cost the economy more than Â£500m and the Conservatives have accused ministers of having ""no exit plan"". But the Welsh Government said any delay would have caused greater harm. Pubs, bars, restaurants and hotels, as well as all non-essential shops will have to close, with people being told only to travel for essential reasons, such as for medical treatment, to buy food and to exercise. The nationwide ""firebreak"", which comes after local lockdowns in communities, aims to slow the rise in Covid cases and hospital admissions. What you need to know about new Covid rules around the UK What are the rules where I live? First Minister Mark Drakeford has reassured the public the ""short, sharp"" lockdown will end as planned on 9 November, with consistent Wales-wide measures coming afterwards. But the Welsh Conservatives and Plaid Cymru have accused the Welsh Government of not having an ""exit strategy"" to end the spread of the virus and restart the economy. At Friday's Welsh Government briefing, First Minister Mark Drakeford said the pandemic would not be over in the coming months but added there were ""things that we can do... to make sure that Christmas of a coronavirus sort can still be celebrated here in Wales"". He added: ""How that will mesh in with the difficulties that are being faced elsewhere in the United Kingdom is just impossible to predict."" The national lockdown brings an end to the local lockdowns imposed on 15 counties, as well as the city of Bangor and town of Llanelli in recent weeks. People can be fined Â£60 for a first coronavirus restrictions offence, up to a maximum fixed penalty notice of Â£1,920. Q&A: What can you do in Wales-wide lockdown? Why has Wales chosen a national lockdown? When would we know a circuit-breaker is working? Primary schools will reopen after next week's half-term break, but only Years 7 and 8 in secondary schools can return at that time under the new rules. It comes as stricter coronavirus rules are coming into force for nearly six million Britons on Friday, including Warrington moving into thehighest level of England's Covid-19 restrictionsalongsideGreater Manchester,LiverpoolCity Region andLancashireafter a surge of Covid-19 cases. Shoppers headed to the high street in Cardiff before stores close tonight Speaking onBBC Radio Wales Breakfast, Health Minister Vaughan Gething said there would be ""greater"" economic harm if the Welsh NHS becomes overwhelmed and there were ""deeper and harder"" measures for a longer period of time. ""If we do this now and if we then have a consistent set of national rules, to keep the transmission and the intensity of the virus at a lower level, then we can have a much more normal Christmas season for businesses,"" he said. ""The month of December is really important for many businesses, if we delayed, we would have almost certainly impacted upon that part of the season."" Dr Margaret Harris, World Health Organization spokeswoman, said people should start planning how to safely celebrate Christmas. ""It will be a new Christmas, but we can enjoy our time together,"" she said. ""We just have to do it slightly apart."" On Friday people enjoyed a drink in Cardiff before bars close at 18:00 But the Welsh Conservatives have accused the Welsh Government of having no plan for what will happen after the Wales-wide lockdown ends. The party's leader in the Senedd Paul Davies said the Welsh Government should be looking at ""hyper-local"" lockdowns rather than imposing a ""damaging"" national lockdown. ""The first minister is taking us into a Wales-wide lockdown without publishing the full data to justify it, the details of what they are going to achieve during the lockdown and now we don't know what the situation is going to be at the end of it,"" he said. ""People are concerned that this second Wales-wide lockdown is just the start of rolling lockdowns over the coming."" Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price said the Welsh Government needed to publish plans on how systems to halt the spread of the virus - including track and trace - would be improved during the next two weeks. ""No-one wants to live in a perpetual state of coming in and out of lockdowns. For the sake of public health and our economy, this break has to be the start of a different approach,"" he said.

The UK's average is between 1.3 and 1.5. Even though Wales has some of the lowest coronavirus infection rates in the UK, First Minister Mark Drakeford said that without this lockdown theWelsh NHS would not be able to cope. The number of patients in hospital in Wales with coronavirus is now the highest since June, according to NHS Wales figures out on Friday. There were 894 people in Welsh hospitals with the virus, up 26% week-on-week, while 43 of them are in critical care, a rise of 72%. This is about two-thirds of the number at the peak. Food shops, off-licences and pharmacies can stay open but supermarkets will beunable to sell items like clothesduring Wales' temporary lockdown and only essential items. Business leaders say companies in Wales have been given just hours to finalise plans for the firebreak. Among those affected was the former winner of the BBC's The Apprentice, Alana Spencer, who was due to open a new cafe on the Aberystwyth sea front on Friday. In atearful social media post,external, she said she was ""gutted"" by the timing and later added it was a ""devastating blow"" to her new business. ""I took to social media and I had a small melt-down,"" she said. Alana Spencer said lockdown was a ""bitter pill to swallow"" in an area with the lowest case rate in Wales However she told BBC Radio Wales she will now use the takeaway service during lockdown to trial new products. ""Luckily we have a hatch on the front so we can do takeaway, so we'll take it from there and open properly at the end of the lockdown,"" she said. ""It's a bitter pill to swallow, when we are in Ceredigion, we have lower numbers and we are being very sensible here, but ultimately people's lives are at risk."" Organisers of an unlicensed rave which attracted 3,000 people in Neath Port Talbot in August were fined Â£10,000 People can be issued a fixed penalty notice ""for most types of breaches"" and fined Â£60 for the first offence. That fine is increased to Â£120 for a second offence and continues to double for repeated offences, up to a maximum of Â£1,920. If prosecuted, however, a court can impose anunlimited fine. Residents of Caerphilly county were the first to go into a local lockdown on 8 September. Key worker Lois Griffiths's son and daughter will continue to go to a childminder as she has to carry on working.

This video can not be played One salon owner says demand has 'doubled' this week The timing has been called""an absolute dog's dinner"" for Welsh businessesas it straddles two UK government financial support schemes - and firms will have to apply for both separately. Furloughends on 31 October but the newJob Support Scheme(JSS) starts on 1 November - and to be eligible for the remaining week of furlough, workers must have already been furloughed for at least three consecutive weeks. On Friday, Finance Minister Rebecca Evans announced an extra Â£5m to help small firms retain workers not eligible for the remaining week of furlough, while another Â£5m will be added to the Discretionary Assistance Fund for people waiting for benefits or facing hardship while still working. Non-essential retailers will be told to close for 17 days from Friday Mr Drakeford had said hefeared employees could face redundancyif the Treasury does not change its support for workers. The Welsh Government had asked for the JSS to be brought forward, or furlough restrictions eased, for the length of the lockdown, and offered to pay the cost for the difference between furlough and the JSS, estimated at Â£11m. However the UK government said ministers in Cardiff knew ""full well"" it was not possible for the Treasury, adding the timing of Wales' lockdown was ""very, very unfair"" on people ""caught by the time gap"". The Treasury said the UK government had provided billions in support to Wales. EASY STEPS:How to keep safe A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? TRAVEL PLANS:What are your rights? IN-DEPTH:Coronavirus pandemic The National Institute Of Economic and Social Research says that up-front cost ""must be set against potential economic benefits"" after lockdown if it is successful in reducing the spread of the virus and restoring economic confidence. More than 100,000 people in Wales work in the accommodation and food industries while nearly 200,000 work in the wholesale and retail trades and car repairs. Estate agents have to close and house viewings and valuations have to stop, a blow for the Haus agency which is to open its new Cardiff branch on Friday - only to close for two weeks in the evening. ""It's been such a challenging time,"" said director Chris Birch. ""Everything involved in running a business, let alone moving in a global pandemic, has taken so much longer and the admin and red tape is another level."" Public health officials and politicians have warned they will not know the full impact of the firebreak lockdown until after it ends on 9 November.

"Beckton water plant is taking part in the scheme Ninety wastewater treatment sites in England, Wales and Scotland will start testing more sewage for coronavirus. The aim is to create an early warning system to detect local outbreaks before they spread. Scientists established earlier this year that fragments of the virus's genetic material could be identified in human waste. A successful trial in Plymouth has detected a cluster of infections in the local area. And scientists in Scotland have found evidence of the virus in waste water samples from most of its health board areas. The results are consistent with areas where there are confirmed cases of Covid-19. Crucially, virus fragments can be detected even when there are only asymptomatic Covid-19 cases in the community. The project is a collaboration between central and local government, along with academic institutions and water companies. Prof Davey Jones, an expert in soil and environmental science at Bangor University, was one of the researchers to get involved. He said: ""We have been monitoring viruses like norovirus and hepatitis in human sewage for the last decade. We added Covid-19 to the list in March this year."" His team discovered that viral levels in wastewater tracked the success of lockdown measures during the first wave. Samples will be analysed for genetic material Waste from sites such as Beckton Sewage Treatment Works in East London, will be tested four times a week from now on. Results of the analysis will then be shared with test-and-trace systems in England, Wales and Scotland - helping them focus on particular communities for extra attention, as well as tipping off local NHS services. Scientists had to overcome some tricky issues to refine the technique, not least that wastewater - by its nature - contains a lot of contaminants and samples vary widely, which makes it tricky to develop a one-size-fits all standard, accurate test. But a pilot in south-west England has already helped to spot a rise in infections that occurred last month in Plymouth, where a cluster was silently growing as a result of several asymptomatic cases. The levels of the virus's genetic material in the wastewater acted as an invaluable early warning system. This video can not be played Coronavirus: Tracking new outbreaks in the sewers ""Levels were very low during the summer and then in September there was a sudden spike,"" said Environment Secretary George Eustice. ""That enabled local health officials to try to identify where around Plymouth there might have been a particular problem, even though the test-and-trace system hadn't shown it up at that point."" Mr Eustice acknowledges these waste tests are not a substitute for an effective test-and-trace regime, but he describes it an ""added tool in the box"". Roseanna Cunningham, the Scottish government's Environment Secretary, said: ""The early data is already providing our public health experts with new information, which complements the wider population testing programme to give a more robust picture of the prevalence of Covid disease in Scotland."" For the moment, the testing will be done at water treatment works, but the hope is that sewage tests might become even more localised over time - perhaps down to individual postcodes. The technique is already being used elsewhere in the world. The University of Arizona in the US, for example, tests waste from its student residences twice a week. Britain is also looking to advise developing countries on the practicalities of this method, as many low-income countries do not have enough testing machines for their populations.

Here are some of the headlines from around the UK and the world today - as millions of people face further restrictions: Supermarkets in Wales have beencovering up non-essential itemsahead of the nation's 17-day firebreak lockdown, which is due to start shortly. From 18:00 BST shops will be forced to close -unless they sell essential items,externalsuch as food. First Minister Mark Drakeford has said supermarkets should also stop selling items such as clothes as a matter of ""fairness"" until 9 November. As shops prepare for the rules to come in, plastic covering has been placed over items such as pillows and cat baskets in Asda in Coryton, Cardiff. The company said it had been given ""little time to implement these changes or clarity on what is deemed 'essential'"" - and a spokesperson ""expressed our deep concerns about the implications for customers accessing products they genuinely need"". Tesco said it would work ""incredibly hard"" to comply with the Welsh government's rules, while Sainsbury's said it was ""working around the clock to put changes in place"".

Rory Cellan-JonesTechnology correspondent People who are told to go into isolation via an alert from the NHS Covid-19 app in England and Wales will not be eligible for government support. Anyone on low income who is instructed to self-isolate in a phone call from NHS Test and Trace can claim a Â£500 payment from their local authority. Now the Department of Health has said the payments will not be available to app users,as reported by Sky News,external. However, the government is exploring ways of changing that. A spokesperson said: ""The NHS Covid-19 app is voluntary with users of it remaining anonymous, which means that currently people are not eligible for the support payment if they are advised by the app to self-isolate.""

Imogen FoulkesBBC News, Geneva The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that the next few months will be ""tough"", with the northern hemisphere in particular at a critical juncture. The head of the WHO, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said too many countries in Europe were seeing an exponential rise in cases, and he called on their governments to take ""immediate action"" to try to ensure that schools could remain open and hospitals did not become overstretched. WHO officials also said it was possible some results from its vaccine trials might be available by the end of the year, but stressed that these would be very preliminary results - ""the bare minimum required for emergency use authorisation"". Police in England will attempt to turn around drivers making non-essential journeys out of Wales during the nation's 17-day firebreak lockdown. Gloucestershire Constabulary confirmed they would patrol routes into the Forest of Dean area, on the England-Wales border, and pull over vehicles they suspected of making long journeys. If the drivers turn out to have driven out of Wales without a valid excuse they will be asked to turn around, the force said, and if they refuse they will then be reported to police in Wales - who can issue fines. A spokesman for the force said: ""While we cannot issue fines to those travelling from Wales into the county, we can inform the host force of those we stop about what has happened so they can take action."" Northern Ireland's deputy first minister has said a potential extension of the nation's four-week circuit-break restrictions cannot be taken off the table. At her first press conference since emerging from a 14-day self isolation after a family member tested positive, Michelle O'Neill said she hoped the measures could be lifted on 13 November. But she stressed an extension may be needed if the virus has not been sufficiently suppressed. ""I think if everybody works really hard at the measures we've brought into place now in this intervention, then we possibly can avoid that. I want us to be able to avoid that. But I'm honest enough to be able to say that all these things have to remain on the table."" She also said thebest way to avoid further lockdownswas to invest in a ""first-class"" test and trace system, Laurence CawleyBBC News Prime Minister Boris Johnson hailed Luton as the""way forward for the entire country""just a few weeks ago, after Covid cases there fell and local restrictions were lifted. But the rate of infection has surged in the past week. The council is now urging residents to voluntarily put themselves under tighter restrictions to avoid being put into a higher tier. How are they reacting? Read more here. A further 20,530 people have tested positive for Covid-19 in the UK, the Department of Health has said.

He insisted any suggestion the decision was based on his own politics was ""nonsensical"", amid criticism from the Welsh Conservatives. He said: ""I'm not prepared to treat small businesses in Wales in one way, requiring them to close - they are not able to earn a living during these two weeks, as part of our national efforts - and then simply because another sector in society are more powerful, are bigger, that they think that they can be treated differently. ""It is a straightforward matter of fairness, we are in this together here in Wales."" The aim of the lockdown was to ""minimise the amount of time that people spend out of their homes during the two-week period"", he said. He said it was ""not the time to browse for non-essentials"". Earlier, at the Welsh Government briefing, Drakeford said the pandemic would not be over in the coming months but added there were ""things that we can do... to make sure that Christmas of a coronavirus sort can still be celebrated here"". But he added that the priority is about ""saving lives not saving Christmas"". Linnete BahatiBBC Monitoring Throughout the pandemic, social media companies have become increasingly bold in deleting viral misinformation. The latest example: YouTube has removed a video claiming masks are ineffective against the spread of Covid-19. The group behind the video calls itself ""America's Frontline Doctors"". And on Facebook, they claimed they had been ""censored"". The video has been widely shared on other platforms. It was deleted from video sharing site Vimeo, and Facebookâs third-party fact checkers have labelled it with a warning, but it went viral on Twitter. Anyone clicking the YouTube link, however, will see a message saying that the video has been taken down because it violated the siteâs terms of service. Weâve contacted YouTube for comment. The doctors claim masks are ""completely irrelevant"" in battling coronavirus. However the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends face coverings ""to provide a barrier for potentially infectious droplets"".

The Welsh Conservatives have called for urgent clarity over which items are classed as essential ahead of the ""firebreak"" lockdown in Wales. The new restrictions come into force from 18:00 BST. People are being told to stay at home, with pubs, restaurants, hotels and non-essential shops shutting for 17 days. Food shops, off-licences and pharmacies can stay open but supermarkets will beunable to sell items like clothesduring Wales' temporary lockdown. Darren Millar, shadow minister for Covid recovery, said with only hours to go until the lockdown begins, ""confusion is rife"". ""Supermarkets, convenience stores and other shops have no idea which goods the Welsh Labour-led government regards as non-essential so that they can restrict them from sale,"" he said. Millar added: ""Making last-minute diktats is irresponsible. Ministers must issue guidance immediately so that businesses and the public know where they stand."" Read our story here Rhoda OdhiamboBBC Africa Health, Nairobi Kenya has reported a sharp increase in Covid-19 cases, with more than 1,000 people confirmed to have contracted coronavirus on Thursday. This is the highest number of single-day cases to be recorded in the country since the first case was reported on 13 March. Critics say the rise in cases is a result of people not adhering to safety measures in open spaces after President Uhuru Kenyatta relaxed restrictions three weeks ago. The health ministry is holding talks with the management of about 20 hotels that will be converted into isolation facilities to ease off pressure in hospitals. Some hospitals are said to have started recording a surge in admissions. Daniel Yumbya, the chief executive of the Medical Pharmacists and Dentists Council, said the country has a total of 18,443 isolation beds - which is not enough. ""Weâre now back to negotiating with private hotels to charge the bare minimum for patients in isolation. We do not want hospitals to be overwhelmed,"" Yumbya told journalists on Thursday. Kenya has so far confirmed over 47,200 coronavirus cases with 870 deaths.

Rob CameronBBC Prague Correspondent Czech Health Minister Roman Prymula has refused calls from the country's prime minister to resign, after being pictured by a tabloid newspaper coming out of a restaurant late at night - despite all such establishments being closed. The affair has thrown the country deep into political crisis, and public confidence in government restrictions has been left in tatters. There was already considerable public grumbling at the latest restrictions, which include closing all pubs and restaurants. So when the man who thought up those rules was caught by a tabloid photographer emerging from a restaurant and without a mask, it appeared his days â perhaps hours â were numbered. However, he now says he was at a meeting in a private room in the building that also houses the restaurant, and that he put on his mask as soon as he got to his car. The country now finds itself in an unedifying and toxic political struggle â right in the middle of the worst health crisis it has ever seen.

Greater Manchester's population of 2.8 million joined Liverpool City Region and Lancashire in England's highest tier of restrictions at midnight. And from 18:00 BST, the 3.1 million people in Wales will have to stay at home as a 17-day lockdown begins. It comes as a minister said there was a ""common purpose here to get the virus down"" so people could enjoy Christmas. ""I think few people expect it to be exactly as it would normally,"" said Chief Secretary to the Treasury Stephen Barclay - but ""the ability of families to spend Christmas together"" was ""something we all hope to be in a position to do"". Welsh health minister Vaughan Gething said the lockdown in Wales was happening now so ""we can have a much more normal Christmas season for businesses"". The UK recorded another 189 deaths and 21,242 new confirmed cases on Thursday. What Covid tier is your area in and what are the rules? Scotland: Sturgeon to set out five-tier Covid alert system Wales: Lockdown to start in bid to save Christmas trade NI: Half of schools record Covid-19 cases Warrington has become the latest place to be placed into tier three - or ""very high"" alert level. The measures will take effect next week. Nottingham and parts of Nottinghamshire are also expected to be moved into tier three next week, with the finer details such as whether or not gyms can stay open still to be decidedas talks continue. The tier three alert level means people cannot mix with other households and pubs and bars will be closed - unless they are serving substantial meals. Some areas in the top tier have also gone further, closing businesses such as bingo halls, casinos, betting shops and soft play centres. Households are banned from mixing outdoors in private gardens or anywhere inside and people are advised against travelling into or out of the area. South Yorkshire will also move into tier three restrictions from 00:01 on Saturday, by which time more than seven million people will be living under England's tightest rules. Rising infections mean that Coventry, Stoke and Slough will move intotier two restrictions at 00:01 on Saturday. The ""high"" alert level means households are banned from mixing indoors and people are encouraged to reduce their use of public transport. In Wales, the ""firebreak"" means people are being ordered to stay at home and pubs, restaurants, hotels and non-essential shops will close until 9 November. Supermarkets have been told not to sell items such as clothes, as First Minister Mark Drakeford said it would be ""made clear"" they should only open the parts of their business that sell essential goods. This video can not be played Mixed views on the firebreak in Wales' first local lockdown area And the Scottish government is to set outits own tiered alert system of Covid restrictions, which will come into force from 2 November. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said it would have five tiers, with the middle tiers corresponding roughly to England's three, plus a lower tier that is ""the closest to normality"" possible without a vaccine. She said an additional top tier would be ""closer to a full lockdown"" - and was added because England's chief medical officer had acknowledged tier three restrictions were not necessarily enough to reduce infections in all circumstances. LOCKDOWN LOOK-UP:The rules in your area THREE TIERS:How will the system work? PAY-PACKET SUPPORT:What will I be paid under the new scheme? VACCINE:How close are we to finding one? The move in Greater Manchester comes after days of confrontation between local politicians and ministers over the level of financial support the area would receive. After the ""very high"" alert level was imposed, the government announceda more generous wage subsidy scheme, backdated to August, for areas that have been under additional restrictions. Shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds says ministers need to be clearer about how they decide what financial support areas will get and how long this will be for. ""Initially it was suggested there was some kind of a negotiation going on between government and local areas about support for businesses,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""Now it looks like actually there's a formula that's being used by government but they haven't published it anywhere, they've not discussed it, it hasn't been voted on for government.""

"Beckton water plant is taking part in the scheme Ninety wastewater treatment sites in England, Wales and Scotland will start testing more sewage for coronavirus. The aim is to create an early warning system to detect local outbreaks before they spread. Scientists established earlier this year that fragments of the virus's genetic material could be identified in human waste. A successful trial in Plymouth has detected a cluster of infections in the local area. And scientists in Scotland have found evidence of the virus in waste water samples from most of its health board areas. The results are consistent with areas where there are confirmed cases of Covid-19. Crucially, virus fragments can be detected even when there are only asymptomatic Covid-19 cases in the community. The project is a collaboration between central and local government, along with academic institutions and water companies. Prof Davey Jones, an expert in soil and environmental science at Bangor University, was one of the researchers to get involved. He said: ""We have been monitoring viruses like norovirus and hepatitis in human sewage for the last decade. We added Covid-19 to the list in March this year."" His team discovered that viral levels in wastewater tracked the success of lockdown measures during the first wave. Samples will be analysed for genetic material Waste from sites such as Beckton Sewage Treatment Works in East London, will be tested four times a week from now on. Results of the analysis will then be shared with test-and-trace systems in England, Wales and Scotland - helping them focus on particular communities for extra attention, as well as tipping off local NHS services. Scientists had to overcome some tricky issues to refine the technique, not least that wastewater - by its nature - contains a lot of contaminants and samples vary widely, which makes it tricky to develop a one-size-fits all standard, accurate test. But a pilot in south-west England has already helped to spot a rise in infections that occurred last month in Plymouth, where a cluster was silently growing as a result of several asymptomatic cases. The levels of the virus's genetic material in the wastewater acted as an invaluable early warning system. This video can not be played Coronavirus: Tracking new outbreaks in the sewers ""Levels were very low during the summer and then in September there was a sudden spike,"" said Environment Secretary George Eustice. ""That enabled local health officials to try to identify where around Plymouth there might have been a particular problem, even though the test-and-trace system hadn't shown it up at that point."" Mr Eustice acknowledges these waste tests are not a substitute for an effective test-and-trace regime, but he describes it an ""added tool in the box"". Roseanna Cunningham, the Scottish government's Environment Secretary, said: ""The early data is already providing our public health experts with new information, which complements the wider population testing programme to give a more robust picture of the prevalence of Covid disease in Scotland."" For the moment, the testing will be done at water treatment works, but the hope is that sewage tests might become even more localised over time - perhaps down to individual postcodes. The technique is already being used elsewhere in the world. The University of Arizona in the US, for example, tests waste from its student residences twice a week. Britain is also looking to advise developing countries on the practicalities of this method, as many low-income countries do not have enough testing machines for their populations.

"Major restrictions to people's lives have been introduced after Wales entered a 17-day ""firebreak"" lockdown. Until Monday 9 November people living in Walesare being told to stay at home. Pubs, bars and restaurants, gyms, and all non-essential shops have been made to close. But what does it mean, and what can you do from 23 October to 9 November without breaking the law? Similar to during the first lockdown in March, people are being told to stay at home in a bid to curb the spread of coronavirus in Wales. You are only allowed to leave your house to go to the shops to buy essential food and medication, get health care and treatment, to provide care, or to take exercise. You should also work from home unless it is not possible. All but essential shops had been told to close from 18:00 BST on Friday. While people are not limited to their local authority, they are being told to shop as close to home as possible and not travel long distances. Supermarkets, pharmacies, post offices and banks remain open, but are being told not to sell non-essential items, such as clothing, toys and homeware. No. Under the new rules people cannot mix with others they do not live with. From Friday you are not meant to meet others indoors, or socialise outdoors, such as in parks or people's gardens. People living alone can meet another household indoors, under the rules During local lockdowns people living alone were allowed to meet one other household indoors from their local areas, after concerns about isolation. This has not changed, with those who live alone or in a single parent households being the only ones able to meet a household they do not live with. This has to be the same one every time. But they can live anywhere, due to this being a national lockdown, however, the Welsh Government has urged people to form an extended household as ""locally as possible"". Over the coming days, expect to see a return to the days of Zoom chats, virtual parties, people waving at each other from the end of drives, and people leaving shopping on door steps. Primary and special schools will re-open as normal on 2 November after the half-term break - there is no extra time off. In secondary schools only pupils in Years 7 and 8 will go back to class. Pupils sitting exams will be able to go in to take them but all other pupils will continue their learning from home for an extra week. Breakfast clubs and after school care is ""essential"" for many families Childcare facilities are staying open during the 17 days in a bid to keep schools open. Grandparents and other relatives can still care for children, but only if no other methods of childcare are available. Where parents live apart, children will be allowed to continue to stay with both parents, with arrangements continuing as normal. No - from 18:00 BST on Friday pubs, bars, restaurants and hotels closed for 17 days. This is similar to the first Wales-wide lockdown back in March. Beer gardens will be shut, and people are being warned not to drink in their friends' homes or gardens, or to gather in parks. Pubs and food establishments are able to operate as takeaways. Hotels and businesses in the tourism sector will not reopen until 9 November. It is illegal to go on holiday in Wales or to travel abroad during lockdown No, travelling to go on holiday in Wales, or outside Wales, including abroad, is not classed as ""essential"" travel during lockdown. If you have pre-booked and paid for a holiday, the Welsh Government is advising people to contact their travel company to discuss the situation. If you live outside of Wales or within Wales, travelling to stay, visit or check on your second home is illegal. You can travel to provide care or to help someone in need - such as an older person, a child or a vulnerable adult - even if they are not part of your household. You can travel to visit someone on ""compassionate grounds"". This may apply if you are worried someone is struggling with being isolated due to the restrictions, is having issues with their mental or physical health, has recently lost a loved one, or you are concerned about their wellbeing or welfare. Travel across the border is now limited to ""essential travel"". This includes providing care, or if you need to visit on compassionate grounds. If you live in a single person or single parent household you can travel across the border to visit your extended household. People who live in Wales but work over the border are able to travel, if they cannot work from home. Care home visits have to be prearranged Indoor visits to care homes may be allowed but only in ""exceptional circumstances"", such as for end-of-life visits. But this is up to local councils and individual homes to decide if it can be done safely, and must be prearranged. Similar rules apply to hospital and children's home visits. Swimming pools and gyms had only recently reopened No - gyms, pools and leisure centres are now closed for the 17 days. However local parks, playgrounds and outdoor gyms remain open. Yes - under the new national lockdown you can leave your house for exercise. Unlike back in March, there is no limit to how many times you can leave the house to exercise or how far you can run, cycle, walk or jog, or to where - as local lockdown boundaries have now ended. But exercising with others, such as running and cycling clubs, is not allowed, and you should start your exercise from home. People are being asked not to drive anywhere to do sport as exercise, unless they have specific health reasons, and people are banned from driving ""significant distances"" to get to mountains, beaches and beauty spots. The government is also asking people to avoid activities which involve a ""significant degree of risk"", such as open water swimming and water sports. Golf and tennis clubs are required to close during the period of the lockdown. The Welsh Government has confirmed that community support groups, who meet on non NHS premises, such as Alcoholics Anonymous, will have to temporarily stop. This is due to gathering restrictions, and rules meaning you are not allowed to meet others from outside your own household. A spokesman said they would be able to meet online. This video can not be played Wales lockdown: sport 'starting to hit thin ice' The autumn Internationals and professional football are allowed to continue behind closed doors, and be broadcast into people's homes. Sportspeople who work and earn a living through sport are allowed to continue working, and like everyone else they can leave home to do so if they cannot work from home. However,elite athletes in sports such as boxing, gymnastics, judo, swimming and athletics who live and train in Wales have seen programmes suspended. All community, amateur sport and training is suspended during the 17 day period. People living in houses of multiple occupation (HMOs) who are single are able to ""bubble up"" with another household in Wales. This also applies to students living in HMOs and to people in supported living arrangements with individual tenancies. You can travel, but only for a ""reasonable"" cause. These include trips to buy essential items - such as food and medication - to seek medical help, get a coronavirus test, or to deliver care. You can also travel to work, but only if you are a critical worker, or you do a job where you cannot work from home. Travelling to go on holiday is against the law. Also, people from outside Wales cannot visit on holiday. Yes, but with reduced services. Economy Minister Ken Skates said he had asked train and bus operators to cut down their services, particularly outside peak hours. He said services would be similar to those running in August, and said it was ""imperative"" the remaining spaces were available for key workers and essential journeys. Taxis are allowed to run if they have measures to cut the risk of transmitting the virus in the car. But they should only be used for essential journeys. Cases have been confirmed at university halls of residence, with thousands of students self-isolating on campuses across Wales. During the 17 days students have been told not to head home, but to stay where they are.First Minister Mark Drakeford added: ""In the same way we are asking everyone to stay at home, if students have reading weeks or half-term they will also need to stay at home in their university accommodation."" During the last lockdown thousands of vulnerable people with medical conditions and the elderly where told to stay in the house and shield, due to being high-risk from the virus. However, the Welsh Government has not re-introduced shielding for such people. The first minister said this was because if everyone stuck strictly to the rules the risk of exposure would be reduced. People are being advised to shop at quieter times of the day if they are high risk. The Welsh Government has stressed that people should still seek medical help. Dentists, opticians, audiology services, chiropody, chiropractors, osteopaths, and counselling and mental health services will remain open.

This video can not be played This couple were due to celebrate tying the knot in front of 300 guests During this 17-day lockdown places of worship are closed to congregations, apart from the holding of weddings, civil partnerships and funerals. Numbers allowed at ceremonies will depend on how many people can fit in the venue, with social distancing in place. Receptions are banned once again. Funerals can go ahead, with social distancing in place, and numbers depending on the venue size. You will not be allowed to host a wake or any gathering following the funeral. House viewings have been suspended from Friday Yes, you can move house, if you cannot delay the moving date until after the short lockdown period is over. However, property viewings cannot take place during the circuit-breaker period and high street estate agencies are required to close. Work can be carried out in people's homes, for example by tradespeople, as long as it is managed in a safe way and both the worker and household members have no symptoms of coronavirus. But the Welsh Government is recommending people consider if the work can be safely deferred until after the lockdown. No work should be carried out in any home where someone is isolating, unless it is to repair a fault which poses a direct risk to people's safety. If the MoT on your vehicle is due, you should still take it to the garage. Driving lessons are banned, and driving tests are not going ahead. This will be an autumn like no other. With people banned from meeting outdoors, trick-or-treating and fireworks are both off. The ban will be ""self-policing"", says First Minister Mark Drakeford. However, planned Remembrance Day events on Sunday 8 November - just hours before the new lockdown ends - will be allowed to go ahead. You may be told to go home or removed from where you are and returned home. You could have to pay a fixed penalty notice of Â£60. This will rise to Â£120 for the second breach. Or you could have criminal proceedings brought against you and, if found guilty, you will have to pay a fine. The first minister has suggested there will not be a return to local lockdown measures in Wales once the 17 days are over. Instead of different communities having different rules, Mr Drakeford has stressed the need for national rules, which will apply in all parts of Wales, so that people will know who they can spend time with over the festive period.

"Police in Sydney arrest a man suspected of possessing child abuse material Australian police have arrested 44 men across the nation on suspicion of possessing and producing child abuse material. Sixteen children had been ""removed from harm"" in the process, the Australian Federal Police (AFP) said. The arrests followed a year-long investigation into images and videos that were shared online. Arrests of the suspects - all aged between 19 and 57 - were made in every Australian state. Police laid a total of 350 charges, all related to possessing or producing child exploitation material. The men had allegedly used a cloud storage platform to share the abuse. The AFP described some evidence as among ""the most abhorrent produced"". Commissioner Reece Kershaw said identifying and rescuing victims was a ""race against time"" in such cases. ""Pixel by pixel, our investigators painstakingly look for clues and never give up,"" he said. An arrest in Adelaide Hundreds of police and other specialists worked on the operation across Australia's states and territories. The arrests numbered 11 in Victoria, 11 in Queensland, nine in South Australia, eight in New South Wales, seven in Western Australia, five in Tasmania and one in the Australian Capital Territory. The suspects worked in industries including construction, transport, law enforcement and hospitality. Police raided houses and seized electronics ""Children are not commodities and the AFP and its partner agencies work around-the-clock to identify and prosecute offenders,"" Mr Kershaw said. The AFP said it had rescued 134 children from child exploitation this year, including 67 who were not in Australia.

"This video can not be played What you missed - the best bits from Trump and Biden's final debate US President Donald Trump and his White House challenger Joe Biden clashed over Covid and race while trading corruption charges, in their final live TV debate. On the pandemic, Mr Biden would not rule out more lockdowns, while Mr Trump insisted it was time to reopen the US. Mr Trump cited unsubstantiated claims Mr Biden personally profited from his son's business dealings. The Democrat brought up Mr Trump's opaque taxes. Mr Biden has a solid lead with 11 days to go until the presidential election. But winning the most votes does not always win the election, and the margin is narrower in a handful of states that could decide the race either way. Live updates: The scramble to claim victory Final debate fact-checked Key takeaways from the debate More than 47 million people have already cast their ballots in a voting surge driven by the pandemic. This is already more than voted before polling day in the 2016 election. There are about 230 million eligible voters in total. In snap polls - from CNN, Data Progress and US Politics - most respondents said Mr Biden had won the debate by a margin of more than 50% to about 40%. Thursday night's primetime duel in Nashville, Tennessee, was a less acrimonious and more substantive affair than the pair's previous showdown on 29 September, which devolved into insults and name-calling. Following that political brawl, debate organisers this time muted microphones during the candidates' opening statements on each topic to minimise disruption. But the 90-minute debate, moderated by NBC's Kristen Welker, was the scene of plenty of personal attacks between the opponents, whose mutual dislike was palpable. Did Trump or Biden sway these voters? And the winner was... Kristen Welker The debate in pictures In individual closing argument to voters, they offered starkly different visions for the nation on everything from shutting down the country to tackle coronavirus, to shutting down the fossil fuel industry to confront climate change. This video can not be played Body language expert Mary Civiello gives her view on Trump and Biden's body language Nowhere was the distinction between the two candidates more apparent than in their approach to the pandemic. Asked about his support for more lockdowns if the scientists recommended it, Mr Biden, a Democrat, did not rule it out. But Mr Trump, a Republican, said it was wrong to inflict further damage on the economy because of an infection from which most people recover. ""This is a massive country with a massive economy,"" said the president. ""People are losing their jobs, they're committing suicide. There's depression, alcohol, drugs at a level nobody's ever seen before."" This video can not be played Presidential debate: Trump and Biden clash on Covid response Mr Trump, 74, declared that the virus was ""going away"" and that a vaccine would be ready by the end of the year, while Mr Biden warned the nation was heading towards ""a dark winter"". The president said: ""We're learning to live with it."" Mr Biden, 77, countered: ""Come on. We're dying with it."" Mr Biden laid blame for the 220,000-plus American deaths as a consequence of the pandemic at Mr Trump's door. ""Anyone who's responsible for that many deaths should not remain president of the United States of America,"" he said. During a back-and-forth on race relations, Mr Trump said: ""I am the least racist person in this room."" He brought up the 1994 crime bill that Mr Biden helped draft and which Black Lives Matter blames for the mass incarceration of African Americans. A simple guide to the US election How is Donald Trump doing in the polls? Why Abraham Lincoln starred in the election debate But Mr Biden said Mr Trump was ""one of the most racist presidents we've had in modern history. He pours fuel on every single racist fire"". He added: ""This guy is a [racial] dog whistle about as big as a fog horn."" Once again, Mr Biden largely held up under fire - avoiding the kind of gaffes and stumbles that could have played into Republican attempts to question his age and mental acuity. The Trump campaign will try to make an issue out of Mr Biden's call for a ""transition"" from oil-based energy - a risky thing to throw in at the tail end of the debate. In an era of hybrid cars and energy-efficient homes, however, when even petroleum companies employ similar language, it may not hit Americans as hard as Republicans imagine. In the end, the raucous first debate probably will be what the history books record. And with polls showing most Americans already having made up their minds - and more than 45 million already having voted - the chance that this evening has a lasting impact on the race seems slim. Read more from Anthony Mr Trump brought up purported leaked emails from Mr Biden's son, Hunter, about his business dealings in China. But Mr Biden denied the president's unfounded insinuation that the former US vice-president somehow had a stake in the ventures. This video can not be played Explaining the Electoral College and which voters will decide who wins ""I think you owe an explanation to the American people,"" said Mr Trump. What was Hunter Biden doing in Ukraine and China? Mr Biden said: ""I have not taken a single penny from any country whatsoever. Ever."" The former vice-president referred to the New York Times recently reporting that Mr Trump had a bank account in China and paid $188,561 in taxes from 2013-15 to the country, compared with $750 in US federal taxes that the newspaper said he had paid in 2016-17 when he became president. ""I have many bank accounts and they're all listed and they're all over the place,"" said Mr Trump. ""I mean, I was a businessman doing business."" Who will be the next US president? You decide Why we might not get a result on election night Has Trump delivered on his promises? Full coverage of the US election Mr Biden described climate change as an ""existential threat to humanity"" and attacked Mr Trump for cutting curbs on polluters. ""Four more years of this man eliminating all the regulations that were put in by us to clean up the climate... will put us in the position where we're going to be in real trouble,"" he said. Mr Trump defended his decision to pull out of the Paris Climate Accord, saying he would not ""sacrifice tens of millions of jobs, thousands and thousands of companies"" for the agreement. The two clashed on energy policy, as Mr Trump asked his challenger: ""Would you close down the oil industry?"" ""I would transition from the oil industry, yes,"" said Mr Biden, adding, ""because the oil industry pollutes significantly."" Where Trump and Biden stand on guns, race and climate He said Big Oil - a reference to big oil companies - had to be replaced by renewable energy over time with the US moving towards net zero emissions. ""Basically what he's saying is he's going to destroy the oil industry,"" said Mr Trump. ""Will you remember that, Texas? Will you remember that, Pennsylvania, Oklahoma, Ohio?"" The Biden campaign afterwards said their candidate had been talking about ending oil subsidies. The two again argued when Mr Trump was asked about his policy of separating hundreds of children from undocumented immigrant adults at the southern US border. The president pointed out that migrant children were also detained under the Obama administration. This video can not be played Presidential debate: Trump says catch and release only works on those with 'lowest IQs' ""Who built the cages, Joe?"" he said, referring to the chain-link enclosures where unaccompanied migrant children were held during the Obama-Biden administration. But the former vice-president said the Trump administration had gone further by separating families and the practice was ""criminal"". Not surprisingly, both candidates accused the other of unfulfilled promises while in office. Mr Biden took his opponent to task for his pledges to come up with a healthcare plan to replace Mr Obama's Affordable Care Act. Mr Trump had been talking about making such a move for years but ""he's never come up with a plan"", the Democrat said. The president, meanwhile, talked about what he said was Mr Biden's own inactivity while in office. ""You keep talking about all these things you're going to do... but you were there just a short time ago and you guys did nothing,"" he said. ""Joe, I ran because of you. I ran because of Barack Obama, because you did a poor job.""

"Police in Sydney arrest a man suspected of possessing child abuse material Australian police have arrested 44 men across the nation on suspicion of possessing and producing child abuse material. Sixteen children had been ""removed from harm"" in the process, the Australian Federal Police (AFP) said. The arrests followed a year-long investigation into images and videos that were shared online. Arrests of the suspects - all aged between 19 and 57 - were made in every Australian state. Police laid a total of 350 charges, all related to possessing or producing child exploitation material. The men had allegedly used a cloud storage platform to share the abuse. The AFP described some evidence as among ""the most abhorrent produced"". Commissioner Reece Kershaw said identifying and rescuing victims was a ""race against time"" in such cases. ""Pixel by pixel, our investigators painstakingly look for clues and never give up,"" he said. An arrest in Adelaide Hundreds of police and other specialists worked on the operation across Australia's states and territories. The arrests numbered 11 in Victoria, 11 in Queensland, nine in South Australia, eight in New South Wales, seven in Western Australia, five in Tasmania and one in the Australian Capital Territory. The suspects worked in industries including construction, transport, law enforcement and hospitality. Police raided houses and seized electronics ""Children are not commodities and the AFP and its partner agencies work around-the-clock to identify and prosecute offenders,"" Mr Kershaw said. The AFP said it had rescued 134 children from child exploitation this year, including 67 who were not in Australia.

"British retail sales have continued to increase for the fifth consecutive month, boosted by non-food items including DIY and garden supplies, according to official figures. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said retail sales volumes rose by 1.5% between August and September. Spending on groceries remained high, but petrol sales were still down as motorists made fewer journeys. Sales are now 5.5% higher than the pre-pandemic levels seen in February. The three months to September saw the biggest quarterly increase on record, as retail sales volumes increased by 17.4% when compared with the previous three months. However, analysts warned that the sales surge was unlikely to last, with many parts of the country returning to coronavirus lockdown. New government Covid scheme to pay up to half of wages UK prices rise faster after Eat Out scheme ends ""While food sales have done well in recent months as people have eaten out less, non-food store sales have now made a recovery at 1.7% above their February levels,"" the ONS said. ""Home improvement sales continued to do well in September, with increased sales in household goods and garden items within 'other' non-food stores."" Fuel was the only main sector to remain below February's pre-pandemic level, the ONS said, with volume sales 8.6% lower in September when compared with February 2020. ""As lockdown eased, we saw an increase in travel and the quantity of fuel bought. However, as many people remained working at home and with certain restrictions still in place, fuel sales were yet to fully recover,"" it added. Another positive contribution came from sales of spectacles and contact lenses, the ONS said. ""We gained feedback from opticians in this sector, suggesting that pent-up demand for eye tests and optical wear increased their sales when lockdown measures had eased,"" it added. The proportion of online sales was at 27.5%, compared with 20.1% reported in February. ""There's no doubting that UK consumers have been doing their bit to boost the economy, following a quarter of record retail sales growth,"" said Lynda Petherick, head of retail at Accenture UKI. ""There's little time for retailers to gather breath, though, and they will already be wondering - or perhaps dreading - what lies ahead in Q4. ""This should be a time for excitement as the crucial 'golden quarter' for retail is now underway. However, with lockdown measures across the UK tightening by the day, retailers are braced for a difficult and unconventional end to the year."" One retailer, James Daunt, chief executive of booksellers Waterstones, told the BBC that his stores were ""entering a very unpredictable period of trading"". On the move towards local lockdowns, he said: ""It's had a negative impact, particularly in large metropolitan cities - big city centres, where people use public transport. ""But in local High Streets, [there is] much less impact and in some, not at all."" Further evidence of the impact of local lockdowns on the economy came fromthe latest IHS Markit/CIPS flash UK composite output index,external, which indicated a ""sharp slowdown"" in growth due to a much weaker contribution from the service sector. The index registered 52.9 in October, down from 56.5 in September and August's recent peak of 59.1. Anything above 50 indicates economic expansion. IHS Markit said respondents to its survey had frequently commented on tighter restrictions across the hospitality sector, with service providers as a whole reporting a decline in new business for the first time since June.

"This video can not be played Mixed views on the firebreak in Wales' first local lockdown area Wales' 17-day lockdown will start later, with the first minister saying the priority is about ""saving lives not saving Christmas"". From 18:00 BST people are being told to stay at home, with all but essential businesses closed. Economists have warned the lockdown may cost the economy more than Â£500m and the Conservatives have accused ministers of having ""no exit plan"". But the Welsh Government said any delay would have caused greater harm. Pubs, bars, restaurants and hotels, as well as all non-essential shops will have to close, with people being told only to travel for essential reasons, such as for medical treatment, to buy food and to exercise. The nationwide ""firebreak"", which comes after local lockdowns in communities, aims to slow the rise in Covid cases and hospital admissions. What you need to know about new Covid rules around the UK What are the rules where I live? First Minister Mark Drakeford has reassured the public the ""short, sharp"" lockdown will end as planned on 9 November, with consistent Wales-wide measures coming afterwards. But the Welsh Conservatives and Plaid Cymru have accused the Welsh Government of not having an ""exit strategy"" to end the spread of the virus and restart the economy. At Friday's Welsh Government briefing, First Minister Mark Drakeford said the pandemic would not be over in the coming months but added there were ""things that we can do... to make sure that Christmas of a coronavirus sort can still be celebrated here in Wales"". He added: ""How that will mesh in with the difficulties that are being faced elsewhere in the United Kingdom is just impossible to predict."" The national lockdown brings an end to the local lockdowns imposed on 15 counties, as well as the city of Bangor and town of Llanelli in recent weeks. People can be fined Â£60 for a first coronavirus restrictions offence, up to a maximum fixed penalty notice of Â£1,920. Q&A: What can you do in Wales-wide lockdown? Why has Wales chosen a national lockdown? When would we know a circuit-breaker is working? Primary schools will reopen after next week's half-term break, but only Years 7 and 8 in secondary schools can return at that time under the new rules. It comes as stricter coronavirus rules are coming into force for nearly six million Britons on Friday, including Warrington moving into thehighest level of England's Covid-19 restrictionsalongsideGreater Manchester,LiverpoolCity Region andLancashireafter a surge of Covid-19 cases. Shoppers headed to the high street in Cardiff before stores close tonight Speaking onBBC Radio Wales Breakfast, Health Minister Vaughan Gething said there would be ""greater"" economic harm if the Welsh NHS becomes overwhelmed and there were ""deeper and harder"" measures for a longer period of time. ""If we do this now and if we then have a consistent set of national rules, to keep the transmission and the intensity of the virus at a lower level, then we can have a much more normal Christmas season for businesses,"" he said. ""The month of December is really important for many businesses, if we delayed, we would have almost certainly impacted upon that part of the season."" Dr Margaret Harris, World Health Organization spokeswoman, said people should start planning how to safely celebrate Christmas. ""It will be a new Christmas, but we can enjoy our time together,"" she said. ""We just have to do it slightly apart."" On Friday people enjoyed a drink in Cardiff before bars close at 18:00 But the Welsh Conservatives have accused the Welsh Government of having no plan for what will happen after the Wales-wide lockdown ends. The party's leader in the Senedd Paul Davies said the Welsh Government should be looking at ""hyper-local"" lockdowns rather than imposing a ""damaging"" national lockdown. ""The first minister is taking us into a Wales-wide lockdown without publishing the full data to justify it, the details of what they are going to achieve during the lockdown and now we don't know what the situation is going to be at the end of it,"" he said. ""People are concerned that this second Wales-wide lockdown is just the start of rolling lockdowns over the coming."" Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price said the Welsh Government needed to publish plans on how systems to halt the spread of the virus - including track and trace - would be improved during the next two weeks. ""No-one wants to live in a perpetual state of coming in and out of lockdowns. For the sake of public health and our economy, this break has to be the start of a different approach,"" he said.

The UK's average is between 1.3 and 1.5. Even though Wales has some of the lowest coronavirus infection rates in the UK, First Minister Mark Drakeford said that without this lockdown theWelsh NHS would not be able to cope. The number of patients in hospital in Wales with coronavirus is now the highest since June, according to NHS Wales figures out on Friday. There were 894 people in Welsh hospitals with the virus, up 26% week-on-week, while 43 of them are in critical care, a rise of 72%. This is about two-thirds of the number at the peak. Food shops, off-licences and pharmacies can stay open but supermarkets will beunable to sell items like clothesduring Wales' temporary lockdown and only essential items. Business leaders say companies in Wales have been given just hours to finalise plans for the firebreak. Among those affected was the former winner of the BBC's The Apprentice, Alana Spencer, who was due to open a new cafe on the Aberystwyth sea front on Friday. In atearful social media post,external, she said she was ""gutted"" by the timing and later added it was a ""devastating blow"" to her new business. ""I took to social media and I had a small melt-down,"" she said. Alana Spencer said lockdown was a ""bitter pill to swallow"" in an area with the lowest case rate in Wales However she told BBC Radio Wales she will now use the takeaway service during lockdown to trial new products. ""Luckily we have a hatch on the front so we can do takeaway, so we'll take it from there and open properly at the end of the lockdown,"" she said. ""It's a bitter pill to swallow, when we are in Ceredigion, we have lower numbers and we are being very sensible here, but ultimately people's lives are at risk."" Organisers of an unlicensed rave which attracted 3,000 people in Neath Port Talbot in August were fined Â£10,000 People can be issued a fixed penalty notice ""for most types of breaches"" and fined Â£60 for the first offence. That fine is increased to Â£120 for a second offence and continues to double for repeated offences, up to a maximum of Â£1,920. If prosecuted, however, a court can impose anunlimited fine. Residents of Caerphilly county were the first to go into a local lockdown on 8 September. Key worker Lois Griffiths's son and daughter will continue to go to a childminder as she has to carry on working. Lois Griffiths and daughter Amy are trying to carry on with their lives ""as best they can"" ""I've got to carry on with my life,"" she said. ""We can't just stick in the house and do nothing - we've got to earn money."" Her 10-year-old daughter Amy is disappointed because lockdown means she can't go to her dance class. ""I feel really sad because I've got 'Team' coming up and I don't want to stop doing that,"" she said. Hair stylist Ellen Watkins is worried about the financial impact of the Covid-19 lockdown Unique Creations has been ""chock-a-block"" as people want a pre-lockdown trim before the hair salon on Blackwood High Street closes on Friday evening. ""We're flat out,"" said stylist Ellen Watkins. ""I'm hoping it will be the same when we come back. There's a lot of worry. I'm looking to buy a house. ""Financially where am I going to be if the salon can't open back up? It's a really scary time for me."" This video can not be played One salon owner says demand has 'doubled' this week The timing has been called""an absolute dog's dinner"" for Welsh businessesas it straddles two UK government financial support schemes - and firms will have to apply for both separately. Furloughends on 31 October but the newJob Support Scheme(JSS) starts on 1 November - and to be eligible for the remaining week of furlough, workers must have already been furloughed for at least three consecutive weeks. On Friday, Finance Minister Rebecca Evans announced an extra Â£5m to help small firms retain workers not eligible for the remaining week of furlough, while another Â£5m will be added to the Discretionary Assistance Fund for people waiting for benefits or facing hardship while still working. Non-essential retailers will be told to close for 17 days from Friday Mr Drakeford had said hefeared employees could face redundancyif the Treasury does not change its support for workers. The Welsh Government had asked for the JSS to be brought forward, or furlough restrictions eased, for the length of the lockdown, and offered to pay the cost for the difference between furlough and the JSS, estimated at Â£11m. However the UK government said ministers in Cardiff knew ""full well"" it was not possible for the Treasury, adding the timing of Wales' lockdown was ""very, very unfair"" on people ""caught by the time gap"". The Treasury said the UK government had provided billions in support to Wales. EASY STEPS:How to keep safe A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? TRAVEL PLANS:What are your rights? IN-DEPTH:Coronavirus pandemic The National Institute Of Economic and Social Research says that up-front cost ""must be set against potential economic benefits"" after lockdown if it is successful in reducing the spread of the virus and restoring economic confidence. More than 100,000 people in Wales work in the accommodation and food industries while nearly 200,000 work in the wholesale and retail trades and car repairs. Estate agents have to close and house viewings and valuations have to stop, a blow for the Haus agency which is to open its new Cardiff branch on Friday - only to close for two weeks in the evening. ""It's been such a challenging time,"" said director Chris Birch. ""Everything involved in running a business, let alone moving in a global pandemic, has taken so much longer and the admin and red tape is another level."" Public health officials and politicians have warned they will not know the full impact of the firebreak lockdown until after it ends on 9 November. Giri Shankar, from Public Health Wales, said there was ""always a lag phase of about two to three weeks"" before any visible change of that intervention can be measured and detected"".

"This video can not be played What you missed - the best bits from Trump and Biden's final debate The mute button, or at least the threat of it, seemed to work. In the second presidential debate, Donald Trump and Joe Biden were more restrained. The candidates allowed each other to speak. They used respectful tones. Even when they went on the attack, they did so in a calm, deliberate manner. After a pugnacious first debate, during which Donald Trump's constant interruptions may have cost him support in subsequent opinion polls, the president has very visibly dialled down the volume - and it made him a much more effective debater. This time, the content of what the candidates are saying might be what the American public remembers from the debate - not the chaotic manner in which it was delivered. Once again, Biden largely held up under fire - avoiding the kind of gaffes and stumbles that could have played into Republican attempts to question his age and mental acuity. The Trump campaign will try to make an issue out of Biden's call for a ""transition"" from oil-based energy - a risky thing to throw in at the tail end of the debate. In an era of hybrid cars and energy-efficient homes, however, when even petroleum companies employ similar language, it may not hit Americans as hard as Republicans imagine. Latest updates, reaction and analysis Trump and Biden clash on Covid, climate and race And the winner was... Kristen Welker Why Abraham Lincoln starred in the election debate In the end, the raucous first debate probably will be what the history books remember. And with polls showing most Americans already having made up their minds - and more than 45 million already having voted - the chance that this evening has a lasting impact on the race seems slim. The Trump campaign complained that this debate was supposed to be focused on foreign policy - perhaps allowing the president to tout what he sees as his accomplishments in the Middle East, trade and Syria and go after Biden on his son's business ties to China. Instead, like earlier debates, it started on the coronavirus pandemic - a topic the American public cares most about, polls suggest. Donald Trump, once again touted a vaccine he said would be ready ""in weeks"". He offered personal testimony to the power of the new drugs to treat the disease and boasted that he was now ""immune"". Biden, not surprisingly, went on the attack. He pointed out Trump had repeatedly promised the disease would disappear on its own. He said there were 220,000 Americans dead and there could be another 200,000 by the end of the year. This video can not be played Trump and Biden clash over the US response to Covid In the back and forth between the two candidates, Trump continued to offer hope that things were getting better and businesses and schools should reopen. And when Trump said that people were ""learning to live"" with the disease, Biden pounced. ""People are learning to live with it?"" he asked. ""People are learning to die with it."" At one point, Trump offered an answer that he said was ""perhaps just to finish this"". The president, clearly, was eager move on to different subjects. Trump telegraphed early and often that he would make Biden's son Hunter a topic of the debate, and it wasn't long before the president brought up the former vice-president's family. He alleged that Biden personally profited from his son's business dealings in Ukraine and China, citing recent news stories based on information allegedly gleaned from Hunter Biden's laptop computer. Biden's defence was a blanket denial, followed by changing the subject to Trump's taxes and business ties to China. That forced the president to spend time explaining about how he really ""pre-paid"" millions of dollars in taxes and again saying he'd someday release his tax returns. The exchange, which would require paragraphs to explain in any sufficient detail, probably left the casual American viewer confused. Trump was counting on drawing blood with his attacks on Biden's family, making this into a controversy that finally pulls his front-running opponent back to earth. Chances are this night won't do that. What was Hunter Biden doing in Ukraine and China Four years ago, Trump rode a hard line on immigration to the Republican nomination and, ultimately, the White House. When the topic came up in Thursday night's debate, however, he tried to downplay some of the more extreme steps he's taken while in office. This video can not be played Trump says catch and release policy only works on immigrants with 'lowest IQs' When asked about his administration's policy of separating the children from the parents of undocumented migrants, for instance, Trump tried to turn the conversation to the detention facilities - ""cages,"" in Trump's term - created by the Obama administration to house unaccompanied minor immigrants. Biden, flashing indignation, noted that the children Trump was detaining came over with their parents and that the policy was making the US a ""laughing stock"". For many American voters, the audio of separated children crying for their parents may still be relatively fresh in their minds. Trump's response, that those children were ""so well taken care of,"" in ""facilities that are so clean"" probably didn't help his cause. Did Trump stop more people coming to US? In the first presidential debate, Trump talked himself into trouble when the topic turned to race relations, as he danced around whether to directly condemn white supremacist groups. This time around, the president was considerably more nimble. He boasted about his cross-party criminal justice reform and funding for historically black colleges. He attacked Biden for his sponsorship of a draconian crime bill in the 1990s that led to a sharp rise in the number of black Americans in prisons. And, perhaps most potently, when Biden began talking about his proposals for reform, he questioned why the former vice-president didn't accomplish more when he served with President Barack Obama. ""It's all talk but no action with these politicians,"" Trump said. ""Why didn't you get it done? You had eight years to get it done."" Anyone who lived through the ""tough on crime"" 1990s in the US would probably be shocked by this debate exchange, where both candidates talked about the number of felons to whom they gave clemency and their efforts at reducing the number of incarcerated Americans. As the mass demonstrations against institutional racism demonstrated earlier this year, the times have indeed changed. A simple guide to the US election How is Donald Trump doing in the polls?

"Donald Trump and Joe Biden will share the stage on Thursday night for the final presidential debate before election day on 3 November. A lot is at stake. For Mr Trump - whose coronavirus diagnosis derailed plans for a debate last week - it is a chance to turn around a flagging campaign as he is currently trailing in the polls. Meanwhile, Mr Biden will work to maintain his frontrunner status, hoping to avoid any gaffes or verbal stumbles. Here's what you need to know. How the world reacted to the first presidential debate The debate will be held from 21:00-22:30 ET (02:00-03:30BST) at Belmont University in Nashville, Tennessee, and you can follow it live on this website. The 90-minute debate will have no commercial breaks. It will be divided into six 15-minute segments, with each candidate given two uninterrupted minutes before they enter into open debate. Here comes the important difference from the first debate, which was filled with interruptions: during these two-minute blocks, only the candidate who has the floor will have his microphone turned on - the other will be temporarily muted. Let's see how well that works out. The six segments will address six separate topics: Fighting Covid-19 American Families Race in America Climate Change National Security Leadership And in terms of coronavirus, safety protocols are expected to be similar to the first Trump-Biden face-off. Candidates will be spaced a safe distance apart and they will not shake hands. The president is being counselled to use a softer touch this time around, after his belligerent attitude in the first debate was thought to have hurt him with suburban women, a key voting demographic. His advisers say allowing an opponent not always known for his way with words to speak uninterrupted could help his cause. The debate commission's decision to mute the other candidate's microphone during the initial two-minute answer period might also help impose some discipline on Trump and put the pressure on Biden to provide the kind of clear, extended answers to policy questions he avoided in the last debate. Any time Biden goes into greater detail about his positions, it risks angering various parts of his electoral coalition, made up of factions - left-wing progressives, blue-collar workers, Democratic moderates and disaffected Republicans - that have very different hopes for a Biden presidency. Trump could very well decide he still needs to go on the attack, of course - or, in the heat of the moment, abandon his planned strategy. Biden flashed his temper two weeks ago but mostly maintained his composure and avoided serious pitfalls. In the final set-piece of a long presidential campaign, he may be tested one more time. There may not have been a clear winner in the last Trump-Biden showdown, but moderator Chris Wallace could be counted among the losers. Despite his best efforts, the veteran journalist struggled to maintain control of the evening and failed to stop Mr Trump's incessant interruptions. Moderator Kristen Welker is already being attacked by Mr Trump This time, NBC's Kristen Welker will be in the hot seat. Before she has asked a single question, she is already under attack from the president. ""She's always been terrible & unfair, just like most of the Fake News reporters,"" Mr Trump tweeted on Saturday. It's a departure from what his own campaign adviser, Jason Miller, told Fox News this month - that Ms Welker would do an ""excellent job"" of hosting the debate. ""I have a very high opinion of Kristen Welker,"" he said, echoing remarks from several of her journalist colleagues, who describe the long-time White House correspondent as tough and fair. From the outside, the candidates' debate preparation looks just as different as the candidates themselves. Mr Trump will host several rallies ahead of the debate Former Vice-President Joe Biden seems to be hunkering down in advance of the debate. He has no public events on his schedule this week and is sending top surrogates like running-mate Kamala Harris out on the trail instead. President Trump, on the other hand, is sticking to his typical schedule, hosting large rallies across the country. In the days before the debate, he'll hopscotch between live events in Arizona, Pennsylvania and North Carolina. Maybe. According to voter surveys before and after the first debate by polling website FiveThirtyEight and Ipsos, voters reported a slight decline in support for Trump, and a slight boost for Biden. And in the days after the face-off, the former vice-president gained some ground in national polls, widening his lead by about three percentage points. Joe Biden saw a small bump in support after the first debate Still, debates are typically targeted at voters who have not yet made up their minds, and there don't seem to be many of them left. A recent Reuters/Ipsos poll found that just 8% of likely voters are still on the fence about who they want as president. A simple guide to the US election How is Donald Trump doing in the polls?
