"Saied Froghi, right, with his brother Farid Froghi, a surgery research fellow, who joked ""all those years of gaming paid off"" Trainee surgeon Saied Froghi played video games like Age of Empires and Halo in his spare time during medical school. But rather than impede his learning, he believes the time he spent in front of a screen has actually helped his surgery skills. He's one of a number of doctors and health professionals who disagree witha professor of surgery who claims medical students are losing manual dexteritybecause they are spending too much time ""swiping"". In fact, video games can improve your manual dexterity, sharpen your reaction time,  and train you to focus on specific tasks, they say. And gaming can even act as a good ""warm up"" exercise for surgeons too, it's claimed. For Saied, playing games helped him with his concentration. ""If you take the example of keyhole surgery, your eyes focus on a screen and your hands move synchronously with what you are doing,"" he said. ""That's a similar scenario to when you are playing football with a games console. Your hands know where the buttons are and how to rotate the instrument."" For Rajin Chowdhury, a registrar in anaesthetic and intensive care at Sheffield Teaching Hospital, gaming has helped make him ""more dextrous"". Video games, he said, improved hand-eye coordination, and many procedures are performed remotely through looking at a screen. ""For example in an appendicectomy, because of the way the camera is inserted in the abdomen, when you move it down [in the body] you move it up on the image. When I want to move right you have to move it left. ""It's not intuitive."" Physiotherapist Ashley James said there is ""very, very little evidence"" to suggest the widespread use of smartphones by students affects their manual dexterity. ""There's not that research out there,"" he said. ""I'm not saying he [Professor Kneebone] doesn't have a point, but the likelihood is the authority and certainty of which he speaks is probably not based on fact or any evidence."" Mr James pointed to a study of 100 medical students, half of whom were frequent mobile phone texters, and half light users. ""The researchers didn't find anything different in terms of dexterity,"" says Mr James. ""But another thing they tested in that study was reaction time. ""Mobile phone frequent texters had improved reaction time."" He added: ""It's just one small study. I wouldn't hang my hat on it but I wouldn't be as forthright on my conclusion as the surgeon is."" One consultant surgeon in Leeds tweeted a story he was told of how a junior doctor got the job done during an operation, citing his Nintendo skills as a help. Allow Twitter content?

Meanwhile Susan Hill, vice president of the Royal College of Surgeons, said: ""I have not noticed any great difference in the dexterity of the medical students or junior doctors I come into contact with, when compared to other generations. ""In fact, I can recall finding some surgical techniques extremely difficult to master myself even though I trained well before the IT revolution,"" she said. ""Although it may be useful for a surgeon to be naturally dexterous, the skills required to operate can be taught. Much of surgical training is about practising skills such as cutting and sewing over and over until they are perfected. ""It's also worth recognising that some of the skills individuals pick up from their time on screen can be useful to their work as surgeons. We're already seeing the beginnings of a future where a surgeon's ability to interact with technology, be that surgical robots or augmented reality, will become increasingly important."" Professor Steve Wigmore, a professor of surgery from the University of Edinburgh, said research is showing that playing computer games ""is a good warm up"" to performing keyhole, or laparoscopic surgery. ""I think the quality of the trainees is down to the quality of the training,"" he said. NHS surgeon and surgery professor Peter Brennan is the chairman of the MRCS exam for the UK and Ireland - the exam which junior doctors need to pass to become surgeons. He said: ""We are not going to let people pass that exam if we don't think they have the skills"". And he added medical students who want to become surgeons often may choose that career path because they are ""good with their hands"". Many surgeons said practice is one of the top ways to improve their stitching and suturing skills - a rule which applies for both the current medical students - and older generations. As surgeon Mr Froghi joked, as the doctors of today get older, ""do you think gardening will contribute to the acquisition and maintenance of new skills?""

"Infamous Boston gangster James ""Whitey"" Bulger has been found dead in a US federal prison in West Virginia. The 89-year-old was discovered unresponsive at the maximum security facility shortly after being transferred there from a Florida jail. A prison union official told the Associated Press news agency the death was being investigated as a homicide. The life of Bulger, who was convicted in 2013 of 11 murders, inspired several films. Profile: James 'Whitey' Bulger James 'Whitey' Bulger's IRA links He was captured in California in 2011 after a 16-year manhunt. Whitey Bulger's mugshot taken upon arrival at Alcatraz in 1959 The former leader of South Boston's Winter Hill gang inspired the film Black Mass featuring Johnny Depp, and The Departed, which won the Academy Award for best picture in 2007. His death came on the same day that he was transferred to the Hazelton penitentiary in West Virginia, which houses 1,385 inmates, according to reports. An inmate with mafia ties is under investigation for Bulger's killing, three sources briefed on the incident told the Boston Globe. Bulger was severely beaten by one or more of his fellow inmates shortly after arriving at the prison, law enforcement sources told CBS. Boston-based WFXT-TV, a Fox affiliate, reports that Bulger was killed hours after being admitted to the general inmate population. James ""Whitey"" Bulger in an undated photo as a young man The Bureau of Prisons declined to comment last week on why Bulger - who was serving a life sentence - was being moved from the Florida penitentiary. But according to the Globe, Bulger was transferred to Florida in 2014 from another prison in Arizona after his relationship with a female psychologist who was counselling him attracted the attention of prison authorities. The details of his death have not been announced, but a local union official for correctional workers at the prisontold CBS,externalthat a ""homicide"" had occurred on Tuesday morning. ""This is the third homicide in seven months at our facility,"" Richard Heldreth said in a phone interview. ""We are very understaffed, we are short about 40 officers."" Bulger and his girlfriend Catherine Greig walk together with two dogs in Boston in 1998 A Department of Corrections statement on Tuesday confirmed his death in custody, and said the FBI had launched an investigation. The statement made no mention of the cause of death, but said that ""no staff or other inmates were injured, and at no time was the public in danger."" US Attorney for the Massachusetts district Andrew Lelling said that his office had been informed of Bulger's death, adding: ""Our thoughts are with his victims and their families."" Bulger was born in 1929 as one of six children in an Irish-American family. Raised in Boston's Irish-Catholic South Boston neighbourhood, he became involved with The Shamrocks gang as a young man, starting off by stealing cars and soon escalating to robbing banks. Bulger at a christening for the son of his hitman, in this undated handout photo He was first arrested for delinquency as a young teenager, and eventually went on to mastermind a criminal empire of loan sharking, gambling, extortion, drug dealing and murder. After being convicted of armed robbery and hijacking, he was sent to the infamous San Francisco prison-island Alcatraz. He apparently liked Alcatraz so much, he visited and posed as a tourist - while he was on the run. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

During his criminal career, Bulger attempted to provide weapons to the paramilitary Irish Republican Army in Northern Ireland. He once strangled two women with his bare hands, and on another occasion tortured a man for hours before using a machine gun to riddle his head with bullets. Bulger is said to have disliked his nickname Whitey - which derived from his light blond hair - preferring to be known as Jimmy. His underworld activities were enabled by a rogue FBI agent who tolerated his crimes so he would supply information on other gangsters. The many faces of Whitey Bulger in an FBI wanted poster Bulger's brother William was a powerful local Democratic politician who became president of the Massachusetts State Senate in 1978 and later the president of the University of Massachusetts. The politician always denied any knowledge of his brother's crimes, but maintained that he loved his brother and could never betray him to law enforcement. Bulger went on the run in 1995 after the FBI agent tipped him off to an impending indictment. The mobster was arrested in 2011 in Santa Monica, California, where he had been hiding out with his girlfriend Catherine Greig, who remains incarcerated at a women's prison in Minnesota. He was convicted in 2013 of a litany of federal crimes, including participating in 11 murders across the US throughout the 1970s and 80s. The US government paid more than $20m in damages to his victims on the grounds he had committed his murders while under government supervision. In a 2015 letter to a group of students who had written to him for a history project, Bulger appeared to express remorse for his past. ""My life was wasted and spent foolishly,"" he wrote.

"This video can not be played Mr Trump and the first lady spent time looking at tributes to the victims US President Donald Trump has offered condolences at the Pennsylvania synagogue where 11 Jewish worshippers were shot dead at the weekend. He was joined by First Lady Melania Trump, his daughter and son-in-law at the Tree of Life temple in Pittsburgh. Hundreds of protesters gathered on the street chanting slogans against the president. The visit came as mourners attended the first funerals for victims of the massacre. Pittsburgh shooting: Who were the victims? Pittsburgh shooting 'will not break us' Anger at 'Jesus prayer' for Jewish victims The Trumps were greeted on Tuesday by Rabbi Jeffrey Myers, who led them inside the temple, where the worst anti-Semitic attack in US history unfolded on Saturday. At a memorial outside, Mrs Trump placed a flower and the president laid a small stone on a marker for each of the victims. Jared Kushner, Ivanka Trump and Steven Mnuchin accompanied Mr Trump on the trip Mr Trump was joined by his son-in-law Jared Kushner, who is Jewish, and his daughter Ivanka, who converted to Judaism when she married Mr Kushner. Both are White House advisers. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who is Jewish, also joined the president. Before his visit, the president condemned anti-Semitism. The alleged gunman was not a Trump supporter. An anti-Trump protest has drawn more than 1,000 people Critics accuse Mr Trump of fomenting a surge in white nationalist and neo-Nazi activity through divisive rhetoric which has seen him criticise immigrants and Muslims in particular. Some Jewish figures and Pittsburgh's Democratic Mayor Bill Peduto opposed the presidential visit. More than 70,000 people signed an open letter from Pittsburgh-based Jewish leaders saying that President Trump was ""not welcome"" in the city unless he ""fully denounces white nationalism"". The top four Republican and Democratic congressional leaders declined a White House invitation to join Mr Trump in Pennsylvania. The White House has rejected any blame over the attack. Eleven people were killed in a mass shooting at the Tree of Life synagogue Members of Pittsburgh's Jewish community were among about 2,000 demonstrators who held a protest, according to Reuters news agency. As the president was driven through Pittsburgh, some bystanders made obscene gestures to his motorcade and thumbs-down gestures, reports AP news agency. As Mr Trump arrived at the synagogue, demonstrators chanted ""President Hate, leave our state"" and ""Words have meaning"". Protesters marched to the Tree of Life synagogue during President Trump's visit They held signs with such slogans as ""We build bridges not walls""; ""Trump, Renounce White Nationalism Now""; and ""Trump's lies kill"". During the presidential visit, one protester holding a baby was seen by reporters calling out: ""We didn't invite you here."" Earlier on Tuesday, mourners paid their respects to four victims of the massacre. Brothers David and Cecil Rosenthal, who were aged 54 and 59, were among the first to be buried. They were the youngest victims of the shooting. During a packed prayer service for the siblings, Rabbi Myers said: ""They could illustrate a dictionary definition for 'pure souls'."" Daniel Stein, 71, and Jerry Rabinowitz, 66, were also laid to rest. The Rosenthal brothers, the first to be buried, were the youngest victims of the synagogue shooting Mr Rabinowitz was a doctor, known for his work with gay men diagnosed with HIV. On Saturday, he was shot and killed after he rushed to help the wounded, his nephew Avishai Ostrin said in an emotional Facebook post. Support for the community has been pouring in from across the country. A GoFundMe page created by an Iranian refugee studying in Washington DC, who has no connection to the Pittsburgh community, has already accumulated $900,000 (Â£700,000) to help rebuild the synagogue and support victims' families. Another fund set up by Muslim-American groups to help pay for funeral costs has raised $200,000. Robert Bowers, 46, is now in the custody of US marshals and faces 29 criminal charges. He was discharged from hospital on Mondayafter being treated for multiple gunshot wounds. During his first court appearance on Monday, Bowers waived his detention hearing and requested a public defender, US media reported. A further hearing has been scheduled for 1 November.

"Notorious mobster James ""Whitey"" Bulger presided over deaths, drug-dealing and extortion as one of Boston's most high-profile gangsters. Now the killer, who was serving two life sentences for 11 murders, has reportedly met a violent end himself at a West Virginia prison. While the Federal Bureau of Prisons has not confirmed what happened, US media report that the 89-year-old was murdered. The FBI has been notified and an investigation launched. The development is entirely typical of Bulger's extraordinary story - a tale as improbable as it is bloody. Whitey Bulger - so-called because of his light blond hair - hated his nickname, and preferred to be known as Jimmy. The FBI used ""James J. Bulger"" on its Most Wanted list, however - and the crime boss topped it in 2011 after the death of Osama Bin Laden. The FBI released these retouched pictures of the fugitive in January, 2003 Bulger was one of Boston's most high-profile gangsters, heading the Irish-American Winter Hill mob from the early 1970s until the mid-1980s. But he lived a double life as a prized FBI informant, feeding the bureau information about rival criminals. The agency described him as an avid reader with an interest in history, who could often be found in libraries or visiting historic sites. Others had less savoury impressions. Tom Foley, who worked on Bulger cases for Massachusetts Police, told CNN: ""The guy is a sociopathic killer, he loved that type of life. He's one of the hardest and cruellest individuals that operated in the Boston area. He's a bad, bad, bad guy."" Prosecutors accused Bulger of strangling two women (though jurors did not reach a verdict on one charge), and of torturing a man for hours before shooting him dead with a machine gun. Bulger lived as a fugitive for 16 years before he was captured in Santa Monica, California, in June 2011. The FBI warned that he had a violent temper, and was known to carry a knife at all times. A $2m (Â£1.25m) reward was offered for information leading to his arrest. In 2007, agents scoured Europe after footage appeared to show Bulger and his lover at a resort in Sicily - but the couple in question turned out to be innocent German holidaymakers. Bulger was born in 1929, and grew up in a poor suburb of South Boston. Like many a gang boss, he began as a bank robber; a career choice that got him sent to the notorious island prison of Alcatraz. Bulger in his Alcatraz mugshot, taken on 16 November, 1959 Other run-ins with the law included the accusation that he had helped smuggle a cache of weapons from the US to the IRA in the early 1980s. James 'Whitey' Bulger's IRA links His lengthy spell on the run started in 1995, when an FBI agent on his payroll tipped him off to his imminent arrest. Before fleeing Boston he apparently stashed away millions of dollars in bank accounts and safety deposit boxes, some of them in the UK. Bulger's dramatic, bloodthirsty story has inspired several films and books. Johnny Depp played the mobster in the 2015 picture Black Mass, and Jack Nicholson's character in Oscar-winner The Departed was based on him. He also had a companion throughout his fugitive years: his long-time girlfriend, dental hygienist Catherine Elizabeth Greig. Reporters look at a 2004 display boards detailing Whitey Bulger's possible sightings - and what he and Catherine Greig were believed to look like The pair settled in at No. 303 in the Princess Eugenia apartment complex, in sunny Santa Monica. In a film-worthy twist, their hidden life was revealed by a neighbour - actress Anna Bjornsdottir, a former beauty queen who was Miss Iceland 1974. During a trip to Iceland, she switched on a TV news report about Bulger - only to realise he was living right beside her. She duly received the $2m reward after alerting the FBI. Investigators found 30 weapons in Bulger's apartment, and more than $800,000 in cash hidden in the walls. He also had a stack of books about criminals, including Escape from Alcatraz. Whitey Bulger's apartment building in Santa Monica Bulger and Greig had kept fit by walking on beaches and in parks, and the FBI listed them as lovers of animals and nature. Greig was sentenced to eight years in prison and fined $150,000 for harbouring Bulger. She is currently in prison in Minnesota, scheduled for release in September 2020. Bulger's brother William was a Massachusetts state senator, and also served as state senate leader. He has insisted he knew nothing about the gangster's life, but was forced to resign as president of the University of Massachusetts in 2003 when it emerged that he had talked to his fugitive sibling by phone eight years earlier, and never reported it. Former Massachusetts Senator William Bulger pictured outside court after his brother's arraignment in 2011 In August 2013, Bulger was convicted in Boston of 11 murders. The following November, he was sentenced to two life terms plus five years. A series of witnesses gave gruesome testimony during the two-month trial, detailing how Bulger would nap after killing his enemies. The accused refused to testify, calling the trial a sham. He denied that he had ever been an FBI informant - and at some points yelled angrily at witnesses. Bulger's activities proved especially expensive to the US justice department, which paid more than $20m in damages to his victims' families, since he had technically been operating under government supervision while he killed them. Judge Denise Casper told the mobster: ""The scope, the callousness, the depravity of your crimes are almost unfathomable. Your crimes are made all the more heinous because they are all about money.""

"Women embrace outside the Rodef Shalom Congregation where the funeral for shooting victims Cecil Rosenthal and David Rosenthal are being held US Vice-President Mike Pence faces controversy after a cleric whose views are shunned by mainstream Jews led prayers for victims of the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting. Rabbi Loren Jacobs appeared at a Republican rally in Michigan where he described Jesus as the Messiah and did not name the victims of the attack. Known as Messianic Jews, the movement is shunned by mainstream Judaism. The first funerals for the victims take place shortly. An aide later told AP news agency Mr Pence had not invited Rabbi Jacobs to the Michigan rally. Eleven worshippers were killed at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in what is thought to be the worst anti-Semitic attack in recent US history. Six other people were injured in the shooting. A long line has formed outside the Rodef Shalom Congregation ahead of the first funeral service for the victims Brothers David and Cecil Rosenthal, who were aged 54 and 59, are among the first to be buried on Tuesday morning, local time. The brothers were the youngest victims of the shooting. Jerry Rabinowitz, 66, is also to be buried on Tuesday. He was a doctor in the Squirrel Hill community, particularly known for his work with gay men diagnosed with HIV. On Saturday, he was able to escape from the synagogue, but chose to go back in order to save others,WTAE News reported,external. Allow Twitter content?

"Bulger, who was once one of the FBI's most wanted fugitives has been jailed for life for 11 murders The US mobster James 'Whitey' Bulger, who was convicted of 11 murders after spending 16 years on the run, has been jailed by a Boston court. BBC News looks at the Irish American's links to the Irish Republican Army. As well as being a mobster, James 'Whitey' Bulger liked to think of himself as an Irish patriot. His power base was south Boston, a blue-collar Irish-Catholic area during Bulger's criminal heyday. Nowadays Southie, as the area is known, is more of an ethnic melting pot, being gentrified by young professionals. But in the 1970s and 1980s it was a part of the city where collection tins were rattled in bars to raise money for the families of IRA prisoners. One of the 11 people Bulger was found guilty of killing, John McIntyre, died after informing the American authorities about a foiled gun running trip organised by Bulger's Winter Hill gang from the US to the Irish paramilitary group. In September 1984, a fishing boat called the Valhalla left Gloucester harbour in Massachusetts. Full of fuel, bait, ice and weapons, it was seized two weeks later by US Customs agents after stopping in Boston on its way home. During its voyage the Valhalla had rendezvoused with the Irish fishing vessel, the Marita Ann, and tonnes of explosives and weapons were transferred. Two Irish naval vessels stopped the Marita Ann off the coast of County Kerry seizing the weapons and arresting her crew, which included a future Sinn FÃ©in member of the Irish parliament, Martin Ferris. The plot had been betrayed by an informant in the Republic of Ireland, Sean O'Callaghan. He was an IRA man who had become disenchanted with the group and was working as an agent for the authorities. No weapons were found on the Valhalla on its return except for an empty 9mm bullet casing. One of the crew on the Valhalla was fisherman John McIntyre. During Bulger's trial a former US customs agent, Donald DeFago, testified that several days after the ship was stopped, McIntyre was arrested on a drunken driving charge and mentioned drug runs to the arresting officers. During one interview, also present was an FBI agent who was friendly with John Connolly, a corrupt FBI agent. After hearing about the interview, Connolly told Bulger that McIntyre had been talking to the authorities. McIntyre had told officers about drug smuggling activities of the Bulger gang and the gun-running. He had not apparently mentioned Bulger by name, but had mentioned other members of the gang. A raid on a Norwegian freighter and the seizure of 36 tons of marijuana belonging to the gang followed. Mr DeFago said McIntyre was approached by Bulger associate Patrick Nee and offered a role in a drugs smuggling deal with a $20,000 (Â£12,400) buy in. This was supplied by US Customs and after meeting Nee in a Boston restaurant McIntyre was told to keep in touch with his handlers every day. He stopped calling his handlers and despite their efforts to find him, his fate had been sealed. His body was found 16 years later. McIntyre had been brought by Nee to a house where Bulger and two other gang members were to ""talk"" to him. He was tortured until he confessed he was an informant and then killed. One of the gang members was Kevin Weeks who told the Bulger trial that after McIntyre was tortured: ""Jim says to him, 'do you want one in the head? And he says, 'yes, please'."" His body was buried in a cellar before being moved to a pit in Dorchester where it was found in 2000, along with two other alleged Bulger victims. The trial was told that his body was identified through matching DNA belong to his mother. In 1994, Connolly told Bulger he would be indicted on racketeering charges, which began his decades on the run. Patrick Nee later wrote a book recalling his exploits as a member of the Boston mob. In Criminal and an Irishman, The Inside Story of the Boston Mob and the IRA, he said that Bulger was a republican sympathiser. He wrote that Bulger ""loved being associated with the IRA and the cause of Irish freedom"". He said that Bulger felt his association with the ""struggle"" gave him legitimacy. Nee wrote that Bulger had met one of the founders of the IRA, Joe Cahill, when the Belfast man came to Boston to rally US support for the IRA. During his time on the run there were reports that Bulger had been spotted in Ireland, with the story being that the IRA was helping him evade capture. The truth was simpler: he had spent his time hiding almost in plain sight for at least 14 years in an apartment in California.

"The community held an interfaith memorial service on Sunday The deadly attack at a Pittsburgh synagogue will ""not break us"", religious leaders said, after the shooting of 11 people. Rabbi Jonathan Perlman, who helped hide people during Saturday's shooting, said: ""What happened yesterday will not break us. It will not ruin us."" The rabbi, along with other congregation leaders, spoke at an interfaith memorial service on Sunday. Suspected gunman Robert Bowers is now in the custody of US marshals. During his first court appearance on Monday, Bowers waived his detention hearing and has requested a public defender, US media reported. A hearing has been scheduled for 1 November. White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders announced during a news conference that President Donald Trump and the First Lady will travel to Pennsylvania on Tuesday. Scott Brady, US Attorney for the Western District of Pennsylvania, says he is seeking the death penalty against the suspect. The final decision will depend on US Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Rabbi Jeffrey Myers told journalists on Monday that the FBI is still gathering evidence inside the synagogue and that it could be at least another week before members were allowed back inside. ""There are hundreds of bullet holes in our sanctuary,"" he said. ""I looked at this [building] and said: 'My God, this is a giant mausoleum.'"" Survivors of what is believed to be the worst anti-Semitic attack in US history recalled taking refuge and hiding in storage rooms to avoid the roaming attacker. One congregation leader said their training in active-shooter situations had helped save lives, and that Rabbi Perlman helped lead worshippers to storage rooms where they could hide. The 11 victims were named on Sunday and included a husband and wife, and a woman aged 97. Community members gather for a vigil for the victims of the mass shooting at the Tree of Life synagogue, in Pittsburgh 'He was a beautiful person, a beautiful soul' Would you tackle a gunman? 'Jewish oasis' mourns a mass shooting America's gun culture in 10 charts Another six people were injured, including four policemen. Mayor Bill Peduto said that this was the ""darkest day of Pittsburgh's history"". When the suspect was detained after a shootout, he reportedly told Swat officers he wanted ""all Jews to die"". Robert Bowers, 46, now faces 29 criminal charges. He was discharged from hospital on Monday morning, local time, after being treated for multiple gunshot wounds. Social media site Gab, which has been criticised for serving as an outlet for the far-right,has now gone offline after it was revealed the suspect had been an active member. Analysis by Jane O'Brien, BBC News Robert Bowers arrived shackled to a wheel chair wearing a blue shirt. His hands were untied to enable him to sign his name. It's OK, I can scribble, he said. The hearing lasted only a few minutes to set a date for Thursday when the prosecution will bring evidence. He was slightly hunched and looked down when addressed by the judge who asked if he wanted to hear the complaint against him. His lawyers declined and Bowers was remanded into the custody of the sheriff with no bail. Bowers faces federal murder and assault charges which could carry the death penalty. He was shot and injured during an exchange of fire with police as he tried to leave the Tree of Life Synagogue where its alleged he killed 11 worshippers in America's worst hate crime against Jews. Three congregations were reportedly meeting at the Tree of Life synagogue in the Squirrel Hill district of Pittsburgh on Saturday morning. Members of the New Light congregation were meeting in a basement area,external, Carl Solomon, 81, a congregation member who turned back from the synagogue but had spoken to survivors, told the New York Times. Pittsburgh shooting: What we know so far 'I'm now more aware of being Jewish' Richard Gottfried, 65, and Daniel Stein, 71, were in the kitchen and both were shot dead. Congregation co-president Stephen Cohen told the paper there was ""no place to hide"" there. He said Rabbi Perlman had shepherded two other people into a storage room, although one, Melvin Wax, 88, chose to later open the door and was shot dead. Mr Cohen said ""everyone froze but Rabbi Perlman"". He told the Associated Press news agency that leaders had taken part in active-shooter drills ""and I think that's what ultimately saved the people who were saved"". They were named on Sunday as Joyce Fienberg, 75; Rose Mallinger, 97; Jerry Rabinowitz, 66; Cecil Rosenthal, 59, and his brother David, 54; married couple Bernice Simon, 84, and Sylvan Simon, 86; and Irving Younger, 69. Tributes have been pouring in from those who knew the victims. Myron Snider described his friend Melvin Wax as a ""sweet, sweet guy"" and unfailingly generous. The Tree of Life Congregation Synagogue in Pittsburgh Ben Schmitt, a patient of Jerry Rabinowitz, said the family medical practitioner was ""kind and funny... [he] completely personified the term 'bedside manner'"". Cecil and David Rosenthal were described as ""kind, good people with a strong faith and respect for everyone around"". One injured officer was released from hospital on Saturday, another was due to be released on Sunday, with the other two needing more treatment. He was armed with three Glock handguns and an AR-15 semi-automatic rifle. He owned them legally, a law enforcement officer told the Associated Press. This video can not be played Police audio of the moment the suspect is captured Officers arrived after receiving calls about an active shooter at 09:54 local time (13:54 GMT) on Saturday and encountered the suspect as he was trying to leave. The gunman fired at them and ran upstairs. As Swat officers searched for victims, the gunman opened fire on them and injured two. The suspect was detained after being wounded in an exchange of fire with officers. Officials said the gunman had made statements regarding genocide as well as a desire to kill Jewish people. There are few details about Robert Bowers but there is a trail of anti-Semitic comments on social media. Suspected attacker Robert Bowers His neighbour, Chris Hall, told AP: ""The most terrifying thing is just how normal he seemed."" Officials said there was nothing to indicate he had any accomplices. FBI special agent Robert Jones told a press conference that Mr Bowers did not appear to be known to authorities prior to the attack. More on Robert Bowers The 29 charges were announced in a statement,externalissued by the US Attorney's Office of the Western District of Pennsylvania: Eleven counts of obstruction of exercise of religious beliefs resulting in death and 11 counts of use of a firearm to commit murder during and in relation to a crime of violence. These can carry the death penalty Four counts of obstruction of exercise of religious beliefs resulting in bodily injury to a public safety officer Three counts of use and discharge of a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence He described the gunman as a ""maniac"" and suggested the US should ""stiffen up our laws of the death penalty"". ""These people should pay the ultimate price. This has to stop,"" he said. This video can not be played What's Donald Trump said about guns and gun control? Mr Trump has ordered US flags at government buildings to be flown at half-mast until 31 October. Gun control around the world He said the shooting had ""little to do"" with US gun laws. ""If they had protection inside, maybe it could have been a different situation."" But Mayor Peduto, a Democrat, said: ""I think the approach that we need to be looking at is how we take the guns, which is the common denominator of every mass shooting in America, out of the hands of those that are looking to express hatred through murder."" Ahead of Mr Trump's proposed visit, progressive activists have called on the president to change his language towards minorities and immigrants. In an open letter, Jewish organisation Bend the Arc has said the president will not be welcome in Pittsburgh until he denounces white nationalism, ends his anti-immigrant rhetoric and commits to ""compassionate"" policies. The letter has over 25,000 signatures as of Monday morning,external. Tree of Life Rabbi Jeffrey Myers, however, told reporters that he refused to let politics enter the conversation because ""hate does not know political party, religion, colour, persuasion or anything"". ""We do need to have strong leadership from all of our elected leaders, not any one person - all of them, from all political parties,"" he added. ""When you speak language of hate as a leader, you give permission to all peoples to say it's ok to speak that language, to treat people that way. My answer is no, it's not."" Who are the victims?

"This video can not be played The Budget headlines in two minutes from Andrew Neil The Budget has been branded ""a bit of a gamble"" by a respected economic research group. The chancellor was able to promise more spending in his budget after forecasts for tax collection were raised, the Institute for Fiscal Studies said. But those forecasts could easily change for the worse, leaving the chancellor in a tight spot, the IFS said. The think tank also warned that many public services will continue to feel squeezed for some time to come. ""This is no bonanza,"" said Paul Johnson, the director of the IFS. ""If I were a prison governor, a local authority chief executive or a head teacher, I would struggle to find much to celebrate. I would be preparing for more difficult years ahead."" Health spending is the exception, with Â£20bn extra funding promised to help the NHS and pay for mental health services. Speaking to the BBC's Today programme earlier, the Chancellor, Philip Hammond, defended his spending decisions. He said that taken as a whole, other departments would see their spending rising in line with inflation.

The IFS said it was not clear yet whether austerity is over. It pointed out that Â£4bn of cuts to welfare spending were still working their way through the system. A judgement on austerity also depends on what is measured, according to the IFS. While total spending, including the effect of inflation, is set to rise, spending as a fraction of national income will fall slightly. Mr Johnson also said this Budget showed the government had abandoned its target to get rid of the gap between spending and income - the deficit - in the near future. ""Any idea that there is a serious desire to eliminate the deficit by the mid-2020s is surely for the birds."" This chancellor is seemingly content to let the deficit float up. That would have, until relatively recently, been considered heresy round his way. Politically, it's a big change of priority and has allowed the government to change its rhetoric substantially. But if you look carefully, a huge amount of that money will be gobbled up quickly by the health service. After that, by some calculations, there simply won't be much to go around - and some departments might even still face cuts. Read Laura's blog The chancellor bases his Budget on figures from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR). This year it revised up its forecasts for tax income, which was an unexpected windfall for the government. However, the IFS warned: ""Yesterday's Budget was a bit of a gamble. ""What the OBR gives this year, it can easily take away again next year. If it does, then the chancellor will have painted himself into a bit of a corner."" To get himself out of that corner, the chancellor would have to raise taxes, or more likely, continue to borrow money, the IFS said. Meanwhile, spending on public health in England and doctors and nurse training is set to fall next year, according to the fine print of the Budget documents. The chancellor announced real-terms funding increases for NHS England, which provides front line services. But the rest of the Department of Health's day-to-day budget next year (2019-20) will fall. The Health Foundation think tank says in real terms, there will be a reduction of Â£1bn, or 12%.

"Italy has been battered by fierce winds and rain which have left 11 people dead in the west and north, while schools and tourist sites closed in several regions amid fears for people's safety. Winds of up to 180km/h (110 mph) were reported, and two tornadoes ripped through the centre of the coastal town of Terracina, killing one person and leaving 10 others injured. In the canal city of Venice, rising floodwaters overwhelmed many of its famed squares and walkways, with officials saying as much as 75% of the city is now submerged. Venice's central St Mark's Square was closed on Monday afternoon, after the water level reached ""acqua alta"" (high water) of 156cm (5.1ft).  It is the fourth highest level ever recorded. Some people took to the raised wooden walkways that are installed when there is flooding. Shopkeepers worked to try to keep the water away from their stock. Beyond Venice in the north, it was a story of high winds, fallen trees and landslides. In the wider Veneto region, a man was killed by a tree and a volunteer fireman died in the north-eastern border region of Alto Adige, also known as South Tyrol. A 61-year-old man was found dead in a river near Belluno, Veneto, close to where his car had been discovered earlier. A woman was killed when her home was hit by a landslide and a fisherman's body was found hours after he went to check on his boat on a lake in Trento. South of the beach resort of Rimini, a kite-surfer aged 63 died when he was hurled against rocks. Across Italy six people died on Monday and further deaths were confirmed on Tuesday. Some of the worst conditions were reported on the west coast, particularly in Liguria in the north-west. The outer breakwater wall in the fashionable port of Rapallo was destroyed as its reinforced concreted crumbled, causing damage to some of the prize yachts moored at the resort. Firefighters had to go to the rescue of 19 people after they became trapped in Rapallo. Further south, the coastal province of Grosseto said it had suffered a ""calamitous"" event, while trees fell down the capital Rome and further south in Naples, where a 21-year-old student was killed. Two tornadoes tore roofs from buildings in Terracina south of Rome, as residents ran for cover. Meteorologists are warning that the bad weather will continue. Transport and power supplies have been disrupted too. All pictures copyright Â© 2025 BBC.

"Rahul Mandal (centre) is crowned champion by judges Paul Hollywood (left) and Prue Leith (right) The Great British Bake Off final was watched by an average live audience of 7.5 million people, according to overnight figures. This is aslight increase on last year's final, which brought in 7.3 million live viewers. A peak audience of 8.1 million saw Rahul Mandal crowned the winner in the final five minutes of the show. Ratings did not match those obtained when the show was on BBC One - the 2016 final brought in 14 million viewers. This was the second series of Bake Off to be broadcast on Channel 4, not including the celebrity specials for Stand Up To Cancer. Tuesday's finale gave the network its highest viewing figures since the broadcast of the Paralympics Opening Ceremony in 2012 -which reached a peak live audience of 11.2 million. Rahul triumphed over fellow finalists Kim-Joy Hewlett and Ruby Bhogal. He was crowned 2018's winner after a near-disaster in the show stopper. He said: ""I don't know whether to laugh or to cry. I just feel I need to talk with my mum."" The moment Rahul was announced winner, celebrated by fellow finalists Kim-Joy (left) and Ruby (right) The final three contestants were evenly matched, having each been named star baker twice during the course of this year's series. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today, Rahul said: ""Only my parents knew about [me applying for Bake Off], in the newspaper they published the news and the rest of the family found out, they are very happy but shocked and surprised. ""I think baking is science, its a mixture of physics, chemistry and engineering so perfectly fits what I do. ""I just want to spread this word to students that maybe they think science is not for them, especially guys in school think they can't bake but its the same thing [as science] - anyone can do it."" Lucy Mangan from The Guardian,externalwas full of praise: ""The most joyful thing about this series of The Great British Bake Off - apart, possibly, from Kim-Joy herself - was that as we entered the final, the average viewer would have been equally content whichever of the three remaining competitors won."" The Mirror's Ian Hyland wrote,external: ""As well as being a great baker, Rahul was a great story. ""The timorous immigrant boy who decided the best way to learn about his new home was to bake his way through its history and customs. You can hear the orchestra tuning up already."" This video can not be played ""His Mum said to me, you're his Mum in England"" says Liz Anson, who with husband David, took Rahul under their wing Michael Hogan from The Telegraph agreed,external: ""It was a triumph of quiet talent as endearingly nerdy nuclear scientist Rahul Mandal, from Rotherham via Kolkata, became the cake-making contest's first male winner for six years. ""His ambitious creations occasionally looked messy but left the judges dumbstruck with their deliciousness."" The Independent's Sean O'Grady was a little less complimentary:,external""I wonder how much more the viewers can take of GBBO, but the format is obviously durable. So maybe another slice or two before it goes mouldy. ""In any case, say what you like about Brexit and the great British industrial productivity problem, we may rest assured that our amateur baking skills lead the world. Let's make Britain bake again!"" In the signature challenge, the bakers were called upon to make two batches of iced doughnuts - one set filled and one set rings. Indian-born Rahul was complimented for his decorations, with Leith saying: ""The colours are absolutely amazing and have such personality."" Kim-Joy, who lives in Leeds, impressed with her amaretto creme diplomat doughnuts. Leith said: ""I might come back and eat that"". And Paul Hollywood praised London-based Ruby's doughnuts adorned with chocolate rainbows: ""They have great designs on the top and the decoration is very clever"". In a Bake Off first, the three finalists were then asked to take their cooking tools outside for a tough technical challenge. Hollywood tasked the trio with making six pita breads and three dips in 90 minutes, using campfires for all the cooking. Kim-Joy, a mental health specialist, won the technical for the first time. Research scientist Rahul came in second and project manager Ruby took third. But it all came down to the show stopper to see who would take the crown. Kim-Joy, Rahul and Ruby all won star baker twice during the series The finalists were given four-and-a-half hours to make a landscape dessert, painting a picture with cake, pastry and biscuits. Drama ensued as Rahul created a rock garden, inspired by Victorian explorers bringing back exciting plants from around the world. But his glass storage container smashed due to the 32C heat in the tent and after a swift clean up by producers he had to start again - with an extra 15 minutes to make up for lost time. Kim-Joy's Lost city of Atlantis was also applauded for being ""original and colourful"". But there were some questions on the amount of ginger she used in her biscuits and cakes - recipes that won her star baker in spice week. Ruby's magical landscape, with unicorns and mushrooms, was praised for its theme. The choux pastry mountain impressed with its height, despite being overcooked, whilst both judges praised the delicious flavours, beautiful sponge and buttery biscuits. But the taste and complexity of Rahul's final bake saw him come back from the brink of disaster to win the final. Leith said: ""He never reined in his ambition, he always tried to do a bit more than everybody else, and it paid off."" Hollywood added: ""He is one of those characters that you will miss when you are not with him. ""I don't think he realises still how good he actually is and I think that's what's magic about Rahul.""

"New American citizens wave American flags during a naturalisation ceremony President Donald Trump says he plans to end ""birthright citizenship"" in the US by executive order. Can he do that? In aninterview with Axios,external, President Trump claimed that he was working on an end to birthright citizenship, the 150-year-old principle that says anyone born on US soil is an American citizen. ""It was always told to me that you needed a constitutional amendment. Guess what? You don't,"" Mr Trump said. ""You can definitely do it with an Act of Congress. But now they're saying I can do it just with an executive order."" Mr Trump claimed that such an order was currently in the works, and not long after, South Carolina SenatorLindsey Graham tweeted,external: ""I plan to introduce legislation along the same lines as the proposed executive order from President @realDonaldTrump."" The president's comments have ignited a furious debate about whether or not the president has the unilateral power to do such a thing, and whether the underlying premise - that birthright citizenship is exploited by undocumented immigrants - has any merit. The 14th Amendment to the United States Constitution was ratified in 1868 The first sentence of the Fourteenth Amendment to the US constitution establishes the principle of ""birthright citizenship"": ""All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside."" Immigration hardlinersargue that the policy is a,external""great magnet for illegal immigration"", and that it encourages undocumented pregnant women to cross the border in order to give birth, an act that has been pejoratively called ""birth tourism"" or having an ""anchor baby"". ""The baby is essentially a citizen of the United States for 85 years with all those benefits. It's ridiculous,"" Mr Trump told Axios. ""It has to end."" A 2015 Pew Research Centerstudy found,externalthat 60% of Americans opposed ending birthright citizenship, while 37% were in favour. Why are Americans giving up their citizenship? Wong Kim Ark was born in the US but denied re-entry after leaving The Fourteenth Amendment was adopted in 1868, after the close of the Civil War. The Thirteenth Amendment had abolished slavery in 1865, while the Fourteenth settled the question of the citizenship of freed, American-born former slaves. Previous Supreme Court decisions, like Dred Scott v Sandford in 1857, had decided that African Americans could never be US citizens. The Fourteenth Amendment overrode that. In 1898, the US Supreme Court affirmed that birthright citizenship applies to the children of immigrants in the case of Wong Kim Ark v United States. Wong was a 24-year-old child of Chinese immigrants who was born in the US, but denied re-entry when he returned from a visit to China. Wong successfully argued that because he was born in the US, his parent's immigration status did not impact the application of the Fourteenth Amendment. ""Wong Kim Ark vs United States affirmed that regardless of race or the immigration status of one's parents, all persons born in the United States were entitled to all of the rights that citizenship offered,""writes Erika Lee,external, director of the Immigration History Research Center at the University of Minnesota. ""The court has not re-examined this issue since then."" Most legal scholars agree that President Trump cannot end birthright citizenship with an executive order. ""He's doing something that's going to upset a lot of people, but ultimately this will be decided by the courts,"" says Saikrishna Prakash, a constitutional expert and University of Virginia Law School professor. ""This is not something he can decide on his own."" Mr Prakash says that while the president can order the employees of federal agencies to interpret citizenship more narrowly - agents with the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, for example - that will inevitably invite legal challenges from people whose citizenship is being denied. That could lead to a lengthy court battle that could ultimately wind up at the US Supreme Court. A presidential executive order could direct federal offices to interpret citizenship a certain way Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan was blunt in rejecting the president's claim he could act unilaterally. ""You cannot end birthright citizenship with an executive order,"" he told Kentucky radio station WVLK. However, Martha S Jones, author of Birthright Citizens,wrote on Twitter,externalthat the Supreme Court has not directly addressed whether or not the children of non-citizens or undocumented immigrants should automatically become citizens at birth. ""Scotus [Supreme Court of the United States] could distinguish from Wong Kim Ark on the facts,"" Ms Jones writes. ""Wong's parents were authorised or we might say legal immigrants. Their presence in the US was authorised."" Mr Prakash agrees. ""People who are on a tourist visa or here without permission... their children are automatically given birthright citizenship,"" he says. ""That's the way it's been read in modern times even though there's been no definitive Supreme Court pronouncement on that."" A constitutional amendment could do away with birthright citizenship, but that would require a two-thirds vote in both the House of Representatives and the Senate and approval by three quarters of US states. Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington Donald Trump's decision to once again push for an end to birthright citizenship - which he now says can be done with a stroke of his presidential pen - should be seen in the context of next week's mid-term elections. As with the White House announcement of more than 5,000 troops dispatched to the US border, this appears to be another effort to focus American attention on the immigration issue. Mr Trump made a hard-line immigration stance a central part of his 2016 presidential campaign and views it as one of the reasons he prevailed. Now, in the electoral home stretch that could determine the success of the second half of his four-year presidential term, Mr Trump is reaching again for a familiar handhold. A poll conducted in 2017 shows a majority of the public supported birthright citizenship, including for undocumented migrants, but 30% were opposed. Even if those numbers haven't changed, convincing that third of the American public that the president is fighting for them - and could get what they want if Republicans hold the Congress - might be enough to tip the balance the president's way in key races next Tuesday. ""This has nothing to do with elections,"" Mr Trump said in a recent interview. The timing of these efforts, however, is hard to ignore. In his remarks to Axios, Trump falsely claimed that the United States is the only country that has birthright citizenship. In fact,more than 30 countries,external- including Canada, Mexico, Malaysia and Lesotho - practise automatic ""jus soli"", or ""right of the soil"" without restriction. Other countries, like the UK and Australia, allow for a modified version where citizenship is automatically granted if one parent is a citizen or permanent resident. This video can not be played Londoners attempt to answer real UK citizenship questions Nor is the United States the only country where the practice has come under fire. In August, delegates at the national convention for Canada's centre-right federal Conservatives voted to end birthright citizenship for children unless one parent is either Canadian or a permanent resident. Following the vote by the grassroots membership, Conservative leader Andrew Scheer said the party would look into developing a more targeted policy addressing the issue of so-called ""birth tourism"". According to the Pew Research Center,external, there were 275,000 babies born to unauthorised immigrant parents in the US in 2014, and 4.7 million US-born children under the age of 18 living with at least one parent who is undocumented. Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, births to unauthorised immigrant parents steadily rose before peaking in 2006, and have declined since then. Bangladeshi immigrant Khadijatul Rahman, 29, holds her baby boy Zavyaan, 2 weeks, after becoming a US citizen in a naturalisation ceremony Although Pew does not have exact numbers on the countries of origin of these parents, Mark Lopez, Director of Global Migration and Demography, says that three-quarters of unauthorised immigrants in the US are from countries in Latin America. ""Hispanics will make up the majority of these children born to unauthorized immigrant parents,"" he says. However, he adds that since we do not know how Mr Trump might write his executive order, the children of visa-holders or other temporary residents may also be impacted.

"This video can not be played Committee chairwoman Yvette Cooper was confused by the minister's point Firms may have to do ""rigorous"" checks on EU staff if there is a no-deal Brexit, a minister has suggested. Caroline Nokes said employers wouldn't be able to tell the difference between people who had settled in the UK and those who had just arrived. In a fractious session, she was repeatedly asked by the Home Affairs Committee what the checks would be and what it would mean for those involved. She offered to clear up any confusion in a letter to the committee. Ms Nokes also revealed the system for EU citizens to register for settled status still didn't work on Apple phones. The US tech giant ""won't release the upgrade we need in order for it to function"", she told MPs. UK's plan for EU citizens who want to stay First Brexit residency applications made PM won't rule out EU citizens special rights UK 'will lose track of many EU migrants' The government wants the estimated 3.5 million EU citizens in the UK to apply for settled status so they can continue living and working here. This status will give EU nationals and their families who have spent five years in the UK the same rights as British citizens, including benefits, education, pensions and healthcare. But it will not have happened by the time Britain leaves the EU on 29 March. In fact, Ms Nokes revealed to the Commons Home Affairs committee, just 650 people had registered so far in a pilot programme. The government insists EU free movement will end in March, but in practice, EU nationals will still be able to come and work in the UK, until the end of the planned 21-month transition period. The only difference is that they will have to register with the authorities. But Ms Nokes suggested that in the event of a no-deal Brexit, where there would not be a transition period, new immigration controls - including employer checks of immigration status - will apply to EU citizens next year. ""If somebody has been through the settled status scheme they would be able to evidence that,"" she said. ""If somebody hasn't been here prior to the end of March next year, employers will have to make sure they go through adequately rigorous checks to evidence somebody's right to work."" BBC home affairs correspondent Dominic Casciani The message that many MPs took away from today's Brexit evidence session was that the Home Office either could not, or would not, explain how crashing out of the EU could affect the lives of millions of people and affect the country's ability to protect the borders. At one point the minister appeared to be unveiling a new employment-checks policy. As Caroline Nokes left the committee room, critics were already pointing out that the Home Office has no plan in place that matches what she told the committee. And with five months to go, there was still no hint of when the department would unveil its new immigration system. On security, there were also more questions than answers. Officials revealed there had been no assessment of the damage that would be done if the UK lost access to an EU intelligence database that police officers use 1.4 million times a day to check for information gathered by their counterparts. That scenario - and others including the loss of the European Arrest Warrant - is causing such alarm among police chiefs, they've put 500 officers on standby to manage the fall-out from a No-Deal crisis. Ms Nokes said the government did not want to ""discriminate"" against EU citizens who had ""every right"" to be in the UK and were ""welcome"" to stay compared with those who were not. ""It would pose a challenge to government and indeed employers in differentiating between those two groups of people,"" she added. In a statement issued later, the Home Office said: ""We will protect EU citizens' rights when we leave the EU, in both a deal or no-deal scenario. ""We are considering a number of options for the unlikely event that we reach March 2019 without a deal, and will set out more information shortly."" But Lib Dem Home Affairs spokesman Sir Ed Davey warned of a repeat of the Windrush scandal, which saw people with the right to live in the UK threatened with deportation because they did not have the right paperwork. ""Millions of EU citizens in the UK have been living under a cloud of uncertainty for more than two years. Far from clearing up that uncertainty today, the immigration minister made it worse,"" said Sir Ed. Caroline Nokes was asked to clarify her evidence to the committee ""We've already seen in the Windrush scandal how the Conservatives' hostile environment checks can destroy the lives of people who have every right to be in the UK. The government's chaotic approach to Brexit risks a repeat of that scandal for EU citizens."" In her evidence to the committee, Ms Nokes confirmed that EU nationals would not be issued with paperwork proving their immigration status. Satbir Singh, chief executive of the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, said: ""Caroline Nokes has stated that employers should check EU nationals' 'paperwork' to determine their right to work post-Brexit, despite the fact that no such paperwork exists. ""Another day, another example of a government with neither the intent nor the ability to run a fair and humane immigration system after Brexit."" Ms Nokes told the committee the government was still trying to get problems with its online application system - first identified in June - fixed. She said it was unfair to ""blame that on the Home Office"" because Apple would not release an update to fix the ""chip checker"". Applicants for settled status with Android phones will be able to download an app which can read the chip in their passport to verify their identity - and they will be able to take a ""selfie"" that can be checked against Home Office records. But Apple device users will not be able to make use of this app, and instead will have to send in their passport to prove their identity.

"Saied Froghi, right, with his brother Farid Froghi, a surgery research fellow, who joked ""all those years of gaming paid off"" Trainee surgeon Saied Froghi played video games like Age of Empires and Halo in his spare time during medical school. But rather than impede his learning, he believes the time he spent in front of a screen has actually helped his surgery skills. He's one of a number of doctors and health professionals who disagree witha professor of surgery who claims medical students are losing manual dexteritybecause they are spending too much time ""swiping"". In fact, video games can improve your manual dexterity, sharpen your reaction time,  and train you to focus on specific tasks, they say. And gaming can even act as a good ""warm up"" exercise for surgeons too, it's claimed. For Saied, playing games helped him with his concentration. ""If you take the example of keyhole surgery, your eyes focus on a screen and your hands move synchronously with what you are doing,"" he said. ""That's a similar scenario to when you are playing football with a games console. Your hands know where the buttons are and how to rotate the instrument."" For Rajin Chowdhury, a registrar in anaesthetic and intensive care at Sheffield Teaching Hospital, gaming has helped make him ""more dextrous"". Video games, he said, improved hand-eye coordination, and many procedures are performed remotely through looking at a screen. ""For example in an appendicectomy, because of the way the camera is inserted in the abdomen, when you move it down [in the body] you move it up on the image. When I want to move right you have to move it left. ""It's not intuitive."" Physiotherapist Ashley James said there is ""very, very little evidence"" to suggest the widespread use of smartphones by students affects their manual dexterity. ""There's not that research out there,"" he said. ""I'm not saying he [Professor Kneebone] doesn't have a point, but the likelihood is the authority and certainty of which he speaks is probably not based on fact or any evidence."" Mr James pointed to a study of 100 medical students, half of whom were frequent mobile phone texters, and half light users. ""The researchers didn't find anything different in terms of dexterity,"" says Mr James. ""But another thing they tested in that study was reaction time. ""Mobile phone frequent texters had improved reaction time."" He added: ""It's just one small study. I wouldn't hang my hat on it but I wouldn't be as forthright on my conclusion as the surgeon is."" One consultant surgeon in Leeds tweeted a story he was told of how a junior doctor got the job done during an operation, citing his Nintendo skills as a help. Allow Twitter content?

""Although it may be useful for a surgeon to be naturally dexterous, the skills required to operate can be taught. Much of surgical training is about practising skills such as cutting and sewing over and over until they are perfected. ""It's also worth recognising that some of the skills individuals pick up from their time on screen can be useful to their work as surgeons. We're already seeing the beginnings of a future where a surgeon's ability to interact with technology, be that surgical robots or augmented reality, will become increasingly important."" Professor Steve Wigmore, a professor of surgery from the University of Edinburgh, said research is showing that playing computer games ""is a good warm up"" to performing keyhole, or laparoscopic surgery. ""I think the quality of the trainees is down to the quality of the training,"" he said. NHS surgeon and surgery professor Peter Brennan is the chairman of the MRCS exam for the UK and Ireland - the exam which junior doctors need to pass to become surgeons. He said: ""We are not going to let people pass that exam if we don't think they have the skills"". And he added medical students who want to become surgeons often may choose that career path because they are ""good with their hands"". Many surgeons said practice is one of the top ways to improve their stitching and suturing skills - a rule which applies for both the current medical students - and older generations. As surgeon Mr Froghi joked, as the doctors of today get older, ""do you think gardening will contribute to the acquisition and maintenance of new skills?""

"New American citizens wave American flags during a naturalisation ceremony President Donald Trump says he plans to end ""birthright citizenship"" in the US by executive order. Can he do that? In aninterview with Axios,external, President Trump claimed that he was working on an end to birthright citizenship, the 150-year-old principle that says anyone born on US soil is an American citizen. ""It was always told to me that you needed a constitutional amendment. Guess what? You don't,"" Mr Trump said. ""You can definitely do it with an Act of Congress. But now they're saying I can do it just with an executive order."" Mr Trump claimed that such an order was currently in the works, and not long after, South Carolina SenatorLindsey Graham tweeted,external: ""I plan to introduce legislation along the same lines as the proposed executive order from President @realDonaldTrump."" The president's comments have ignited a furious debate about whether or not the president has the unilateral power to do such a thing, and whether the underlying premise - that birthright citizenship is exploited by undocumented immigrants - has any merit. The 14th Amendment to the United States Constitution was ratified in 1868 The first sentence of the Fourteenth Amendment to the US constitution establishes the principle of ""birthright citizenship"": ""All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside."" Immigration hardlinersargue that the policy is a,external""great magnet for illegal immigration"", and that it encourages undocumented pregnant women to cross the border in order to give birth, an act that has been pejoratively called ""birth tourism"" or having an ""anchor baby"". ""The baby is essentially a citizen of the United States for 85 years with all those benefits. It's ridiculous,"" Mr Trump told Axios. ""It has to end."" A 2015 Pew Research Centerstudy found,externalthat 60% of Americans opposed ending birthright citizenship, while 37% were in favour. Why are Americans giving up their citizenship? Wong Kim Ark was born in the US but denied re-entry after leaving The Fourteenth Amendment was adopted in 1868, after the close of the Civil War. The Thirteenth Amendment had abolished slavery in 1865, while the Fourteenth settled the question of the citizenship of freed, American-born former slaves. Previous Supreme Court decisions, like Dred Scott v Sandford in 1857, had decided that African Americans could never be US citizens. The Fourteenth Amendment overrode that. In 1898, the US Supreme Court affirmed that birthright citizenship applies to the children of immigrants in the case of Wong Kim Ark v United States. Wong was a 24-year-old child of Chinese immigrants who was born in the US, but denied re-entry when he returned from a visit to China. Wong successfully argued that because he was born in the US, his parent's immigration status did not impact the application of the Fourteenth Amendment. ""Wong Kim Ark vs United States affirmed that regardless of race or the immigration status of one's parents, all persons born in the United States were entitled to all of the rights that citizenship offered,""writes Erika Lee,external, director of the Immigration History Research Center at the University of Minnesota. ""The court has not re-examined this issue since then."" Most legal scholars agree that President Trump cannot end birthright citizenship with an executive order. ""He's doing something that's going to upset a lot of people, but ultimately this will be decided by the courts,"" says Saikrishna Prakash, a constitutional expert and University of Virginia Law School professor. ""This is not something he can decide on his own."" Mr Prakash says that while the president can order the employees of federal agencies to interpret citizenship more narrowly - agents with the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, for example - that will inevitably invite legal challenges from people whose citizenship is being denied. That could lead to a lengthy court battle that could ultimately wind up at the US Supreme Court. A presidential executive order could direct federal offices to interpret citizenship a certain way Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan was blunt in rejecting the president's claim he could act unilaterally. ""You cannot end birthright citizenship with an executive order,"" he told Kentucky radio station WVLK. However, Martha S Jones, author of Birthright Citizens,wrote on Twitter,externalthat the Supreme Court has not directly addressed whether or not the children of non-citizens or undocumented immigrants should automatically become citizens at birth. ""Scotus [Supreme Court of the United States] could distinguish from Wong Kim Ark on the facts,"" Ms Jones writes. ""Wong's parents were authorised or we might say legal immigrants. Their presence in the US was authorised."" Mr Prakash agrees. ""People who are on a tourist visa or here without permission... their children are automatically given birthright citizenship,"" he says. ""That's the way it's been read in modern times even though there's been no definitive Supreme Court pronouncement on that."" A constitutional amendment could do away with birthright citizenship, but that would require a two-thirds vote in both the House of Representatives and the Senate and approval by three quarters of US states. Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington Donald Trump's decision to once again push for an end to birthright citizenship - which he now says can be done with a stroke of his presidential pen - should be seen in the context of next week's mid-term elections. As with the White House announcement of more than 5,000 troops dispatched to the US border, this appears to be another effort to focus American attention on the immigration issue. Mr Trump made a hard-line immigration stance a central part of his 2016 presidential campaign and views it as one of the reasons he prevailed. Now, in the electoral home stretch that could determine the success of the second half of his four-year presidential term, Mr Trump is reaching again for a familiar handhold. A poll conducted in 2017 shows a majority of the public supported birthright citizenship, including for undocumented migrants, but 30% were opposed. Even if those numbers haven't changed, convincing that third of the American public that the president is fighting for them - and could get what they want if Republicans hold the Congress - might be enough to tip the balance the president's way in key races next Tuesday. ""This has nothing to do with elections,"" Mr Trump said in a recent interview. The timing of these efforts, however, is hard to ignore. In his remarks to Axios, Trump falsely claimed that the United States is the only country that has birthright citizenship. In fact,more than 30 countries,external- including Canada, Mexico, Malaysia and Lesotho - practise automatic ""jus soli"", or ""right of the soil"" without restriction. Other countries, like the UK and Australia, allow for a modified version where citizenship is automatically granted if one parent is a citizen or permanent resident. This video can not be played Londoners attempt to answer real UK citizenship questions Nor is the United States the only country where the practice has come under fire. In August, delegates at the national convention for Canada's centre-right federal Conservatives voted to end birthright citizenship for children unless one parent is either Canadian or a permanent resident. Following the vote by the grassroots membership, Conservative leader Andrew Scheer said the party would look into developing a more targeted policy addressing the issue of so-called ""birth tourism"". According to the Pew Research Center,external, there were 275,000 babies born to unauthorised immigrant parents in the US in 2014, and 4.7 million US-born children under the age of 18 living with at least one parent who is undocumented. Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, births to unauthorised immigrant parents steadily rose before peaking in 2006, and have declined since then. Bangladeshi immigrant Khadijatul Rahman, 29, holds her baby boy Zavyaan, 2 weeks, after becoming a US citizen in a naturalisation ceremony Although Pew does not have exact numbers on the countries of origin of these parents, Mark Lopez, Director of Global Migration and Demography, says that three-quarters of unauthorised immigrants in the US are from countries in Latin America. ""Hispanics will make up the majority of these children born to unauthorized immigrant parents,"" he says. However, he adds that since we do not know how Mr Trump might write his executive order, the children of visa-holders or other temporary residents may also be impacted.

"Billionaire Mike Ashley has announced a deal to buy Evans Cycles which will see half of the bike chain's shops close, resulting in hundreds of job losses. The struggling firm was placed into administration before being sold to Sports Direct International. Mr Ashley, who founded Sports Direct, said: ""In order to save the business, we only believe we will be able to keep 50% of stores open in the future."" Evans, which is nearly 100 years old, has 62 shops and employs 1,300 people. It emerged last month that the retailer was seeking a rescue deal, with accountancy firm PwC brought in as advisers. Matt Callaghan, joint administrator and a partner at PwC, said it had been a very difficult year for Evans following the cold snap at the start of 2018 and a lack of cash to invest in stores and online. ""A combination of losses, the capital expenditure requirements and tightening credit has led to a liquidity crunch,"" he said. Evans is the second retailer that Mr Ashley's firm has rescued in as many months. In August, Sports Direct paid Â£90m to buy House of Fraser shortly after the department store chain entered administration. By Dearbail Jordan With this latest deal - to rescue bike chain Evans Cycles - billionaire businessman Mike Ashley has returned to the sports and outdoor roots that have mostly dominated his career. After establishing Sports Direct in 1982, Mr Ashley has built his business through buying up well-known names such as Dunlop Slazenger, outdoor gear specialist Karrimor, hat-maker Kangol and the boxing brand Lonsdale. Mike Ashley is the founder and chief executive of Sports Direct Sports Direct also owns the iconic London sports store Lillywhites and Mr Ashley - widely reported to be a Tottenham fan - owns Newcastle United football club. But the Evans Cycles deal is notable for another reason. As more retailers fall, the wider Mike Ashley's control of Britain's High Streets spreads. His portfolio includes House of Fraser and luxury fashion chain Flannels as well as major shareholdings in Debenhams and French Connection. Mr Ashley even controls Agent Provocateur which, like House of Fraser and Evans, he bought after the upmarket lingerie chain went intro administration. What isn't clear is what Mr Ashley's strategy is. Is there method to his investments or is it some kind of Monopoly board power grab? Perhaps the next deal - because undoubtedly there's bound to be another in the not too distant future - will make things clearer. James Keany at commercial property firm CBRE, which is advising Sports Direct on Evan Cycles, said: ""We are looking forward to working with landlords in order to help create a sustainable business. ""We will make contact with landlords over the next few days and discuss the future of individual stores."" Cyclist Frederick Evans opened a shop - FW Evans Cycles - on Kennington Road in south London in 1921 He died in a road accident in 1944 The business was acquired by Joseph Smith in the 1950s and sold bikes as well as toys. His son Gary took over some 20 years later and returned it to a specialist cycling outlet and oversaw its expansion Active Private Equity bought a controlling stake in the company for about Â£35m in 2008 In 2015 Evans was sold to private equity firm ECI Partners in a deal valuing it at about Â£75m Ashley sacks House of Fraser management Evans Cycles seeks new owner amid cash crunch Wildfire sweeps through Hollywood Hills and threatens landmarks as chaos grips LA Paris Hilton among stars 'heartbroken' as she watches home 'burn to ground' Commuters warned of icy roads as cold snap continues to freeze UK Sound Of 2025: Ezra Collective are 'keeping music real' The Papers: 'Apocalypse' LA and 'Reeves faces extra tax rises' How Australia's beach cabana drama sparked a turf war H-1B: Visa row under Trump fuels anxiety for Indian dreamers 'I thought I was going to die': Jailed Venezuelan activist details brutality of prison life The man who could become Canada's future PM 'Trump 2.0' looms large over the global economy A politician was shot dead in Bangkok.

"A jury unanimously found Raphael Kennedy guilty of killing his son, Dylan Tiffin-Brown A drug dealer who murdered his two-year-old son in a ""savage and sustained attack"" has been jailed for at least 24 years. Raphael Kennedy, 31, waited more than an hour to dial 999 after inflicting 39 injuries on Dylan Tiffin-Brown. He beat the toddler, who had five different drugs in his system when he died, in a fit of temper, Northampton Crown Court heard. Kennedy was given a life term afterbeing found guilty of murder. During a three-week trial, he had told the court he was ""not the perfect parent"" and admitted he made his living dealing crack cocaine and heroin. He said he had been selling drugs in the lead-upto the fatal attack at his flat in Arthur Street on 15 December. When Dylan was taken to hospital, Kennedy initially told paramedics that he had ""tripped and fell over"". Sentencing, Mrs Justice Sue Carr said: ""Whatever triggered the assault, you lost your temper with him and inflicted a savage and sustained attack on him. ""You undoubtedly beat Dylan in a fit of anger or stress so hard as to fracture his ribs and tear his liver.Â You used some sort of object to beat his arms. ""Dylan would have been in agony, bewildered and terrified. Slowly his condition would have deteriorated before your eyes, going from screaming and crying to curling up and trying to avoid movement."" Mrs Justice Carr said Kennedy's failure to call an ambulance for his son, whom he had only met for the first time 10 weeks earlier, deprived him of any hope of survival. Kennedy, who described Dylan as his ""little bestie"" in court, told an ""elaborate web of lies"" and his story ""chopped and changed with the wind"", she said. ""The truth has now caught up with you,"" she added. Dylan had five different types of drug in his body when he died, including cocaine and heroin As well ashaving heroin and cocaine in his system,Dylan also had multiple fractures, lacerations to his liver and substantial abdominal injuries that would have left him in significant pain. But Det Ch Insp Ally White, from the East Midlands Special Operations Unit, said three nationally-recognised experts all agreed Dylan's ""catastrophic"" injuries could not be explained by ""a simple fall"". In a statement, Dylan's mother said he was ""the most perfect little boy you could ever meet"". She said: ""He had a smile as bright as the sun, his eyes were crystals like the stars above and his love was the best feeling in the world. ""Knowing I won't get to hold my baby again leaves a pain like no other."" Police had raided Kennedy's flat on 18 October - two month's before Dylan's murder - and found heroin, cocaine and cannabis as well as a phone, scales and packaging used for drug dealing. A serious case review by the Northamptonshire Safeguarding Children's board about Dylan's death is expected to be published next month.

"Infamous Boston gangster James ""Whitey"" Bulger has been found dead in a US federal prison in West Virginia. The 89-year-old was discovered unresponsive at the maximum security facility shortly after being transferred there from a Florida jail. A prison union official told the Associated Press news agency the death was being investigated as a homicide. The life of Bulger, who was convicted in 2013 of 11 murders, inspired several films. Profile: James 'Whitey' Bulger James 'Whitey' Bulger's IRA links He was captured in California in 2011 after a 16-year manhunt. Whitey Bulger's mugshot taken upon arrival at Alcatraz in 1959 The former leader of South Boston's Winter Hill gang inspired the film Black Mass featuring Johnny Depp, and The Departed, which won the Academy Award for best picture in 2007. His death came on the same day that he was transferred to the Hazelton penitentiary in West Virginia, which houses 1,385 inmates, according to reports. An inmate with mafia ties is under investigation for Bulger's killing, three sources briefed on the incident told the Boston Globe. Bulger was severely beaten by one or more of his fellow inmates shortly after arriving at the prison, law enforcement sources told CBS. Boston-based WFXT-TV, a Fox affiliate, reports that Bulger was killed hours after being admitted to the general inmate population. James ""Whitey"" Bulger in an undated photo as a young man The Bureau of Prisons declined to comment last week on why Bulger - who was serving a life sentence - was being moved from the Florida penitentiary. But according to the Globe, Bulger was transferred to Florida in 2014 from another prison in Arizona after his relationship with a female psychologist who was counselling him attracted the attention of prison authorities. The details of his death have not been announced, but a local union official for correctional workers at the prisontold CBS,externalthat a ""homicide"" had occurred on Tuesday morning. ""This is the third homicide in seven months at our facility,"" Richard Heldreth said in a phone interview. ""We are very understaffed, we are short about 40 officers."" Bulger and his girlfriend Catherine Greig walk together with two dogs in Boston in 1998 A Department of Corrections statement on Tuesday confirmed his death in custody, and said the FBI had launched an investigation. The statement made no mention of the cause of death, but said that ""no staff or other inmates were injured, and at no time was the public in danger."" US Attorney for the Massachusetts district Andrew Lelling said that his office had been informed of Bulger's death, adding: ""Our thoughts are with his victims and their families."" Bulger was born in 1929 as one of six children in an Irish-American family. Raised in Boston's Irish-Catholic South Boston neighbourhood, he became involved with The Shamrocks gang as a young man, starting off by stealing cars and soon escalating to robbing banks. Bulger at a christening for the son of his hitman, in this undated handout photo He was first arrested for delinquency as a young teenager, and eventually went on to mastermind a criminal empire of loan sharking, gambling, extortion, drug dealing and murder. After being convicted of armed robbery and hijacking, he was sent to the infamous San Francisco prison-island Alcatraz. He apparently liked Alcatraz so much, he visited and posed as a tourist - while he was on the run. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

During his criminal career, Bulger attempted to provide weapons to the paramilitary Irish Republican Army in Northern Ireland. He once strangled two women with his bare hands, and on another occasion tortured a man for hours before using a machine gun to riddle his head with bullets. Bulger is said to have disliked his nickname Whitey - which derived from his light blond hair - preferring to be known as Jimmy. His underworld activities were enabled by a rogue FBI agent who tolerated his crimes so he would supply information on other gangsters. The many faces of Whitey Bulger in an FBI wanted poster Bulger's brother William was a powerful local Democratic politician who became president of the Massachusetts State Senate in 1978 and later the president of the University of Massachusetts. The politician always denied any knowledge of his brother's crimes, but maintained that he loved his brother and could never betray him to law enforcement. Bulger went on the run in 1995 after the FBI agent tipped him off to an impending indictment. The mobster was arrested in 2011 in Santa Monica, California, where he had been hiding out with his girlfriend Catherine Greig, who remains incarcerated at a women's prison in Minnesota. He was convicted in 2013 of a litany of federal crimes, including participating in 11 murders across the US throughout the 1970s and 80s. The US government paid more than $20m in damages to his victims on the grounds he had committed his murders while under government supervision. In a 2015 letter to a group of students who had written to him for a history project, Bulger appeared to express remorse for his past. ""My life was wasted and spent foolishly,"" he wrote.

"This video can not be played Budget headlines in two minutes Philip Hammond has said there will be no ""real terms"" increase in public spending apart from on the NHS. The chancellor used his Budget on Monday to say that austerity was coming to an end. But Labour's shadow chancellor John McDonnell rejected his claims, saying more welfare cuts were coming and spending was still being squeezed. Mr Hammond chose to spend a windfall from better tax receipts on the NHS, universal credit and income tax cuts. Prime Minister Theresa May said bringing austerity to an end was ""not just about more money into our public services, it is about more money in people's pockets as well"". Budget a bit of a gamble, says IFS LIVE: MPs debate the Budget Budget calculator 2018 - what it means for you At-a-glance summary: Budget key points She said Monday's Budget had put more money into the NHS without raising taxes, adding: ""Indeed, we have cut taxes for 32 million people - the message of yesterday's Budget is that the hard work of the British people has paid-off."" But the Institute for Fiscal Studies said Mr Hammond may have ""painted himself into a corner"" by using a windfall from revised borrowing forecasts to fund increased spending on the NHS. And it warned that tax rises are ""all but inevitable"" in the longer run to pay for the pressure on the NHS of Britain's ageing population. Any expectation that Mr Hammond will now meet his target of eliminating the deficit by the mid-2020s was ""for the birds"", said IFS director Paul Johnson. Kuenssberg: A change in direction 'Squeeze continues' for low income families Pienaar: The political fallout Public spending will go up by 1.2% but most of that will go to the health service in England, Mr Hammond told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. He said next year's spending review would decide how much police, local government, schools, defence and other public services would get. But ""once you take out the commitment we have made to health, (it) gives a flat real spending available for all other departments"". He did not deny that some departments could face cuts but told Today the other option was that ""everybody"" would get a 0% increase in funding, once inflation was taken into account. This video can not be played Philip Hammond is questioned on Today over his one-off Â£400m injection for schools Teachers and parentshave reacted with anger to the announcement,saying schools needed more money for teachers. Labour's shadow education secretary Angela Rayner said Mr Hammond's choice of language was ""utterly insulting to parents and teachers"". Mr Hammond told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the money was a ""one-off"" payment - and he would be looking at overall school spending next year. ""If a school needs to buy a couple of whiteboards or lap top computers or something like that. Having a cheque for Â£50,000 I would have thought would be quite useful for most schools,"" he told Today. The Resolution Foundation, a not-for-profit research and policy organisation, which says its goal is to improve outcomes for people on low and modest incomes, said poorer families would be about Â£30 a year better off from the tax cuts, with the top 10% earners Â£410 better off. The organisation said better than expected public finances had given Mr Hammond an extra Â£74bn to play with - and he had used up three-quarters of that with the extra spending on the NHS, welfare and the income tax changes. The personal allowance will rise to Â£12,500 and the higher rate threshold to Â£50,000 in April 2019, worth Â£130 a year for a typical base rate taxpayer. Mr Hammond said the Â£1bn investment in universal credit would protect claimants moving onto the new system and a further pledge of Â£1.7bn a year would save millions of families Â£630 a year. But some MPs said it was not enough to undo cuts already made to the system in previous years.

Wine duty will not be frozen and a bottle will go up by 8p from 1 February next year, and a packet of 20 cigarettes has gone up by 33p. By BBC Health Editor Hugh Pym Spending on public health in England and doctors and nurse training is set to fall next year according to the fine print of the Budget documents. The chancellor announced real terms funding increases for NHS England which provides front line services. But the rest of the Department of Health day to day budget next year (2019/20) will fall - the Health Foundation think tank says in real terms there will be a reduction of Â£1bn, or 12%. This slice of funding covers prevention initiatives run by Public Health England and local authorities, including smoking cessation and sexual health.  It also includes the budget for Health Education England. The previous chancellor, George Osborne, was criticised for announcing increases for NHS England while at the same time cutting allocations for public health and medical and nurse training. It was the last Budget before the UK's scheduled exit from the EU, and came with the final relationship between the two sides yet to be agreed. There was an extra Â£500m to prepare for what happens if the UK leaves the EU without a deal - a scenario Mr Hammond has said would require a whole new Budget. The chancellor also promised a ""double deal dividend"" if the UK and the EU reached agreement over Brexit, which he said could give him more cash to spend on public services. But he said he had been ""very cautious"" in maintaining fiscal headroom - the gap between what he can borrow and what he is planning to borrow - in case of a ""shock"" to the economy, such as a no-deal Brexit. This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: ""This is a broken promise Budget"" Mr Hammond rejected suggestions his Budget giveaways were meant to pave the way for a general election, telling ITV's Good Morning Britain: ""We've now turned a corner and we are able to give Britain a bit of good news."" Mrs May, speaking at a summit of Northern European leaders in Norway, rejected talk of a snap election, saying: ""No we are not preparing for another general election. That would not be in the national interest."" But shadow chancellor John McDonnell said: ""The tradition of the Tories is to cut taxes before an election and then take all the money back again."" He said an election might well be coming because the government ""think they may well fall apart"" and be ""forced"" into holding one. Corbyn - Budget is full of broken promises And he dismissed Mr Hammond's claim that austerity was ""coming to an end"". He said: ""It is now clear austerity is not over, the cuts to social security will continue and Philip Hammond gave no assurances that departments won't face further cuts."" There was nothing in the speech to ""repair the damage to schools, the police and local councils"" he said, adding that the universal credit cash was less than a third of the welfare cuts still scheduled. The SNP's Westminster leader Ian Blackford said the UK was ""wholly unprepared"" for Brexit, and Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable said the Budget was ""a standstill non-event"". Andy Burnham criticised John McDonnell over tax cuts John McDonnell said Labour would support Mr Hammond's income tax cuts, but make the system fairer if they won power. But former Labour cabinet minister, and now mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham, said on twitter: ""At a loss to understand why we are doing this."" And Tottenham MP and former culture minister David Lammy said: ""We should not be supporting tax cuts that disproportionately help the wealthy. Tory cuts will benefit rich families 14 times more than the poor according to (Resolution Foundation) analysis."" Former work and pensions secretary Yvette Cooper said: ""This is wrong. I cannot support it."" Accordingto the Resolution Foundation,,externalthe richest 10% of households will benefit the most from the changes to income tax personal allowance changes.

"The era of austerity is not over for working families on benefits or government departments like transport, according to one of the first independent analyses of the Budget. The Resolution Foundation said Philip Hammond had delivered Â£55bn in tax cuts and increases in public spending. It said that richer households would feel the most positive effects. However, the report highlighted that many of the cuts to welfare announced in 2015 are still to be rolled out. That includes the Â£1.5bn benefits freeze for people in work which the foundation said would see a low income couple with children up to Â£200 a year worse off. The Resolution Foundation, a not-for-profit research and policy organisation, said it was the top 10% of households that would gain most - around Â£410 a year - from the decision to increase the amount people can earn before they start paying income tax and the higher rate of tax. Poorer households would gain around Â£30 a year. Speaking to the BBC's Today programme, the chancellor pointed out that he had allocated an extra Â£6.5bn for Universal Credit and raised the Living Wage. ""If you look at all the measures in the Budget - and we've done this very carefully - you will see that it is those on the lowest incomes that proportionately benefit the most,"" he said. The Resolution Foundation said that with borrowing far lower than expected and economic growth predicted to be slightly higher over the next two years, Mr Hammond decided to spend three quarters of the Â£74bn extra headroom that was provided by the better public finances. ""The chancellor was able to navigate the near impossible task in his Budget of easing austerity, seeing debt fall and avoiding big tax rises, thanks to a Â£74bn fiscal windfall,"" said Torsten Bell, the director of the foundation. ""He chose to spend the vast majority of this on the NHS, income tax cuts and a welcome boost to Universal Credit. ""But while yesterday's Budget represented a seismic shift in the government's approach to the public finances, it spelt an easing rather than an end to austerity - particularly for low and middle income families."" At-a-glance summary What it means for you Hammond hails better borrowing figures Tech giants face digital services tax Contractors face higher tax and NI payments Budget calculator Mr Bell said the chancellor had made ""very welcome"" commitments to helping people on the new Universal Credit benefit but that three-quarters of the benefit cuts announced in 2015 were still to take effect. ""Income tax cuts announced yesterday will overwhelmingly benefit richer households, with almost half of the long-term gains going to the top 10% of households,"" Mr Bell said. ""On public services the NHS saw a big spending boost - but unprotected departments still have further cuts pencilled in."" This Budget has certainly seen a turnaround in the government's approach to the public finances - with day-to-day spending per person set to rise by 4% a year until 2023 - in contrast with a 4% fall previously planned. In his Budget yesterday, Mr Hammond said that the ""hard work"" of the British people was paying off ""and the era of austerity was finally coming to an end"".

"Suzy Lamplugh was reported missing at 18:45 BST on 28 July 1986 A garage linked to the murder of Suzy Lamplugh, who was last seen alive more than 30 years ago, is set to be dug up. Estate agent Suzy, 25, from London, disappeared in July 1986 and was declared dead, presumed murdered, in 1994. A body has never been found. Police are searching at a house in Sutton Coldfield, Birmingham, once owned by the mother of John Cannan - the prime suspect in Suzy's killing. The Met Police refused to comment on ""speculation surrounding the search"". However, it confirmed it was leading the operation, supported by officers from West Midlands Police. An aerial shot of the search area in Sutton Coldfield Suzy's brother Richard said he hoped her body would be found so the family could say a ""proper goodbye"". ""It has been a long time and we have had our expectations raised before but it would nice if we could finally have some closure,"" he told the Mail Online. Homeowner Phillip Carey, 52, said he bought the house on Shipton Road from John Cannan's mother Sheila 26 years ago and was aware of the back story. ""We knew who she was, we became aware who she was as we went through the relationship, and obviously it was high profile at the time."" He told the BBC police arrived on Monday and were investigating a garage behind the semi-detached home, which he used to store DIY items and an old fridge. The iron structure had been dismantled and police were particularly interested in what was underneath its concrete floor, Mr Carey said. The property is being searched by police The BBC understands work to remove parts of the concrete floor has begun. Mr Carey said he believed there was a ""50-50 chance"" Suzy's remains would be found. ""It's a possibility,"" he said. ""There's always a possibility."" This video can not be played Phillip Carey's home is at the centre of a search for Suzy Lamplugh's body Father-of-two Mr Carey said officers had previously performed searches at the property ""on and off"" from the end of 2003 to the spring of 2004. ""They knew what they were looking for. It was just patio they were looking at as far as I was aware,"" he said. Suzy Lamplugh was declared dead in 1994 One of four children, Suzy was born in Cheltenham but grew up in East Sheen, south London. Described by family and colleagues as a conscientious, outgoing and happy young woman, she worked as a beautician on the QE2 cruise liner before becoming an estate agent. At the time of her disappearance, she had been living in a two-bedroom flat in Putney she had purchased a year earlier. Her parents Diana and Paul, who have both since died, described her as someone who lived life to the full. Speaking in 2016, Suzy's father recalled a conversation where his wife ""was chiding her for doing too much"" and Suzy said: ""Come on mum life is for living"". Suzy's diary showed an entry for an appointment with Mr Kipper at 12:45 BST While Suzy's body has never been found, what is known of her final movements has been well documented. She disappeared on 28 July 1986, after going to meet a client - known only as Mr Kipper - who was never traced. Suzy took her keys and a purse containing Â£15 to the appointment in Fulham, south west London, but left her handbag at her office. According to police, she was wearing a grey skirt, dark jacket and low stiletto heels when she was last seen. Later that day, witnesses reported seeing her arguing with a man outside a property in Shorrolds Road. When she failed to attend another appointment, her manager at Sturgis estate agents reported Suzy missing the same evening. A few hours later, police found her company car outside a property for sale in Stevenage Road, one-and-a-half miles away from her original appointment. The white Ford Fiesta had been left with its doors open and Suzy's purse in the door pocket. The key was missing. Investigations also traced the address given by Mr Kipper - and found no-one of that name. No-one has ever been charged in connection with Suzy's disappearance, but in 2002 police named convicted killer Cannan as the only suspect. John Cannan bore a strong resemblance to an e-fit of Mr Kipper - the man she was seen talking to on the day she went missing Three days before Suzy's disappearance, John Cannan was released from Wormwood Scrubs Prison, where he had been serving a six-year sentence for rape. He bore a strong resemblance to an e-fit of the abductor and, according to reports, was nicknamed Kipper while serving his earlier sentence. Now aged 64, in 1989 he was jailed for life for the abduction and murder of Bristol newlywed Shirley Banks and two further rapes. Cannan was ordered to serve a minimum of 35 years in prison, meaning he would be eligible to be considered for parole from 2024. But the then Lord Chief Justice, Lord Lane, said he would ""probably never be safe to release"". In November 2002, police took the unusual step of naming Cannan as the prime suspect in Suzy's murder. However, no prosecution has ever been brought, with police citing insufficient evidence. Cannan hasalways denied any involvement,external. This video can not be played Jim Dickie led a review of the investigation into Suzy's disappearance Jim Dickie, a former Met Police deputy chief inspector, who led a review of the case in 2000, told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme police were likely acting on new evidence. ""It seems as if the [operation] is going to be quite extensive,"" he said. Mr Dickie said his team spoke to John Cannan's mother during their review but did not carry out an ""extensive search"" of the site. There was ""no evidence"" Cannan had ""secreted Suzy's body there"", he said. However, Mr Dickie said Cannan remained ""firmly in the frame as a suspect"", and was ""never eliminated"". Latest news and updates from the West Midlands He said there was ""no doubt [Cannan] was in Fulham on the day Suzy went missing"". The case was reopened in 2000 after a car police believed might have been used to kidnap Suzy was traced. Two sites in Worcestershire - a former Army barracks and a field outside thevillage of Drakes Broughton-  and a woodland in the Quantock Hills, Somerset, have also been searched. Paul and Diana Lamplugh, pictured in May 2000, campaigned for changes in the law Suzy's mother Diana,who died in 2011, set up the Suzy Lamplugh Trust four months after her daughter disappeared. The workplace safety charity has successfully campaigned for private hire vehicle licensing in London, bringing about the Protection from Harassment Act 1997 which tackled stalking, and setting up the National Stalking Helpline. In 2016, Suzy's father said he had little hope left of finding out what happened to her. The trust saidMr Lamplugh died on 12 June this year,external. He and his wife have both been awarded OBEs for their work. In a statement issued on Tuesday morning, the trust said: ""Today's news reminds us once again of the continuing tragedy of Suzy's story and the importance of employers taking responsibility for the personal safety of their staff.""

"This video can not be played Christian Marbach tells the BBC it is hard to accept his grandfather's murder An ex-nurse in Germany has admitted at the start of his trial that he murdered 100 patients, making him one of the world's most prolific serial killers. Detectives say Niels HÃ¶gel administered fatal doses of medication to the people in his care - causing cardiac arrest - at two hospitals in northern Germany. His motive, prosecutors say, was to impress colleagues by trying to revive the very patients he had attacked. HÃ¶gel, 41, is already serving a life term for six deaths while in his care. He is now said to have killed 36 patients in Oldenburg and 64 in nearby Delmenhorst between 1999 and 2005. Niels HÃ¶gel hid his face from the cameras in court on Tuesday He was later seen being led to a police vehicle When asked by the judge in the Oldenburg court if the charges against him were true, the 41-year-old confessed to ""more or less"" all of them. The current trial, which started with a minute's silence for the victims, is expected to last until May. It follows years of toxicology tests on 130 sets of exhumed remains. By Jenny Hill, BBC News, Berlin Dozens of relatives of those who died at the hands of Niels HÃ¶gel were in court to hear his confession. Many of them are demanding to know how he was able to kill - with apparent impunity - so many people in the confines of two hospitals. Death rates rose significantly during HÃ¶gel's time. Disturbing details have emerged: it's been widely reported that HÃ¶gel was allowed to continue working for two days after he was caught ""red handed"" having administered drugs to a patient, during which time he killed another patient. Many relatives believe health authorities chose to turn a blind eye. An investigation is under way to determine whether their actions facilitated the murderous ambitions of post-war Germany's most prolific serial killer. Investigators say he may have killed even more but potential victims have been cremated. Christian Marbach, a spokesperson for relatives, said it was a scandal the ex-nurse had been allowed to kill with impunity for years without officials intervening. ""We fought for four years for this trial and expect HÃ¶gel is sentenced for another 100 murders,"" said Mr Marbach, whose grandfather was killed by HÃ¶gel. ""I hope he will be found guilty on each count so that the loved ones can finally find some closure,"" said Petra Klein, who runs a victims' support group. Relatives of his alleged victims were expected to pack the court but journalists in the room noted many empty seats in reserved rows. HÃ¶gel was first caught in 2005 injecting unprescribed medication into a patient in Delmenhorst. In 2008 he was jailed for seven years for attempted murder. In 2014-15, a second trial found him guilty of two murders and two attempted murdersand he was given the maximum sentence. He said he was ""honestly sorry""and hoped families would find peace. He said the decisions to carry out his crimes had been ""relatively spontaneous"". However, during the trialhe confessed to a psychiatrist that he had killed up to 30 people. Investigators then widened the investigation, exhuming 130 former patients and looking for evidence of medication that could have triggered cardiac arrest. They also pored over records in the hospitals he worked at. Records at the Oldenburg hospital showed rates of deaths and resuscitations had more than doubled when HÃ¶gel was on shift, German media reported.

"The Rosenthal brothers, the first to be buried, were the youngest victims of the synagogue shooting The first of the 11 victims of the US shooting at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh have been laid to rest. Hundreds paid their respects on Tuesday at the funerals of brothers Cecil and David Rosenthal and Jerry Rabinowitz, who were killed on Saturday. President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump visited Pittsburgh to pay their respects amid a large protest by hundreds of people. Critics said the president's trip drew attention away from the funerals. As President Trump arrived, demonstrators chanted: ""President hate, leave our state."" Mr Trump and the first lady visited the scene of the massacre on Tuesday ""Trump, Renounce White Nationalism Now,"" read one sign. Another said: ""Trump's lies kill."" During the president's visit to the synagogue one protester holding a baby was seen by reporters calling to Mr Trump's motorcade: ""We didn't invite you here."" Mr Trump was accompanied on by his son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner, who is Jewish, and Mr Kushner's wife, Ivanka Trump, a convert to Judaism. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who is also a Jew, joined the president, too. A long line has formed outside the Rodef Shalom Congregation ahead of the first funeral service for the victims Some Jewish figures and Pittsburgh's Democratic mayor Bill Peduto have opposed the presidential visit. The 11 worshippers were shot and killed at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in what is thought to be the worst anti-Semitic attack in US history. Six other people were injured. An anti-Trump protest has drawn over 1,000 residents Lines of mourners stretched for several blocks at the public services on Tuesday. Brothers David and Cecil Rosenthal, who were aged 54 and 59, were among the first to be buried. They were the youngest victims of the shooting. During a prayer service for the brothers, Rabbi Myers reportedly told the packed service: ""They could illustrate a dictionary definition for 'pure souls.'"" Jerry Rabinowitz, 66, was also buried on Tuesday. He was a doctor in the Squirrel Hill community, particularly known for his work with gay men diagnosed with HIV. On Saturday, he was shot and killed after he rushed to help the wounded, his nephew Avishai Ostrin said in an emotional Facebook post. Protesters against Mr Trump's visit held signs saying 'words matter' and 'renounce white nationalism' ""When he heard shots he ran outside to try and see if anyone was hurt and needed a doctor,"" he wrote. ""That was Uncle Jerry, that's just what he did."" Daniel Stein, 71, was also buried in a private service on Tuesday. Pittsburgh shooting: Who were the victims? Pittsburgh shooting 'will not break us' As the Pittsburgh Jewish community plans for the victims' funerals, which are scheduled all week, support has been pouring in from across the country. A GoFundMe fundraiser created by an Iranian refugee studying in Washington DC, who has no connection to the Pittsburgh community, has already received over $839,000 (Â£658,000) to help rebuild the synagogue and support victims' families. Women embrace outside the Rodef Shalom Congregation where the funeral for shooting victims Cecil Rosenthal and David Rosenthal are being held Another fund set up by Muslim-American groups to help pay for funeral costs has raised over $195,000. The Jewish Federation of Greater Pittsburgh said people had donated over $205,000, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reported. More than 70,000 people signed an open letter from Pittsburgh-based Jewish leaders saying that President Trump was ""not welcome"" in the city unless he ""fully denounces white nationalism"". The White House has rejected any blame over the attack. Jared Kushner, Ivanka Trump and Steven Mnuchin accompanied Mr Trump on the trip US Vice-President Mike Pence also provoked controversy after a cleric whose views are shunned by mainstream Jews led prayers for victims at a Republican rally on Monday. Anger at 'Jesus prayer' for Jewish victims Known as Messianic Jews, the movement is shunned by mainstream Judaism. Social media users were angered by the presence of a figure whose movement is viewed by mainstream Judaism as a branch of evangelical Christianity.

"This video can not be played Committee chairwoman Yvette Cooper was confused by the minister's point Firms may have to do ""rigorous"" checks on EU staff if there is a no-deal Brexit, a minister has suggested. Caroline Nokes said employers wouldn't be able to tell the difference between people who had settled in the UK and those who had just arrived. In a fractious session, she was repeatedly asked by the Home Affairs Committee what the checks would be and what it would mean for those involved. She offered to clear up any confusion in a letter to the committee. Ms Nokes also revealed the system for EU citizens to register for settled status still didn't work on Apple phones. The US tech giant ""won't release the upgrade we need in order for it to function"", she told MPs. UK's plan for EU citizens who want to stay First Brexit residency applications made PM won't rule out EU citizens special rights UK 'will lose track of many EU migrants' The government wants the estimated 3.5 million EU citizens in the UK to apply for settled status so they can continue living and working here. This status will give EU nationals and their families who have spent five years in the UK the same rights as British citizens, including benefits, education, pensions and healthcare. But it will not have happened by the time Britain leaves the EU on 29 March. In fact, Ms Nokes revealed to the Commons Home Affairs committee, just 650 people had registered so far in a pilot programme. The government insists EU free movement will end in March, but in practice, EU nationals will still be able to come and work in the UK, until the end of the planned 21-month transition period. The only difference is that they will have to register with the authorities. But Ms Nokes suggested that in the event of a no-deal Brexit, where there would not be a transition period, new immigration controls - including employer checks of immigration status - will apply to EU citizens next year. ""If somebody has been through the settled status scheme they would be able to evidence that,"" she said. ""If somebody hasn't been here prior to the end of March next year, employers will have to make sure they go through adequately rigorous checks to evidence somebody's right to work."" BBC home affairs correspondent Dominic Casciani The message that many MPs took away from today's Brexit evidence session was that the Home Office either could not, or would not, explain how crashing out of the EU could affect the lives of millions of people and affect the country's ability to protect the borders. At one point the minister appeared to be unveiling a new employment-checks policy. As Caroline Nokes left the committee room, critics were already pointing out that the Home Office has no plan in place that matches what she told the committee. And with five months to go, there was still no hint of when the department would unveil its new immigration system. On security, there were also more questions than answers. Officials revealed there had been no assessment of the damage that would be done if the UK lost access to an EU intelligence database that police officers use 1.4 million times a day to check for information gathered by their counterparts. That scenario - and others including the loss of the European Arrest Warrant - is causing such alarm among police chiefs, they've put 500 officers on standby to manage the fall-out from a No-Deal crisis. Ms Nokes said the government did not want to ""discriminate"" against EU citizens who had ""every right"" to be in the UK and were ""welcome"" to stay compared with those who were not. ""It would pose a challenge to government and indeed employers in differentiating between those two groups of people,"" she added. In a statement issued later, the Home Office said: ""We will protect EU citizens' rights when we leave the EU, in both a deal or no-deal scenario. ""We are considering a number of options for the unlikely event that we reach March 2019 without a deal, and will set out more information shortly."" But Lib Dem Home Affairs spokesman Sir Ed Davey warned of a repeat of the Windrush scandal, which saw people with the right to live in the UK threatened with deportation because they did not have the right paperwork. ""Millions of EU citizens in the UK have been living under a cloud of uncertainty for more than two years. Far from clearing up that uncertainty today, the immigration minister made it worse,"" said Sir Ed. Caroline Nokes was asked to clarify her evidence to the committee ""We've already seen in the Windrush scandal how the Conservatives' hostile environment checks can destroy the lives of people who have every right to be in the UK. The government's chaotic approach to Brexit risks a repeat of that scandal for EU citizens."" In her evidence to the committee, Ms Nokes confirmed that EU nationals would not be issued with paperwork proving their immigration status. Satbir Singh, chief executive of the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, said: ""Caroline Nokes has stated that employers should check EU nationals' 'paperwork' to determine their right to work post-Brexit, despite the fact that no such paperwork exists. ""Another day, another example of a government with neither the intent nor the ability to run a fair and humane immigration system after Brexit."" Ms Nokes told the committee the government was still trying to get problems with its online application system - first identified in June - fixed. She said it was unfair to ""blame that on the Home Office"" because Apple would not release an update to fix the ""chip checker"". Applicants for settled status with Android phones will be able to download an app which can read the chip in their passport to verify their identity - and they will be able to take a ""selfie"" that can be checked against Home Office records. But Apple device users will not be able to make use of this app, and instead will have to send in their passport to prove their identity.

"Karen Hadaway (left) and Nicola Fellows had gone out to play after school Lawyers for a man accused of murdering two nine-year-olds have told jurors one of the girl's fathers may be to blame. Russell Bishop, 52, is on trial for a second time charged with killing Karen Hadaway and Nicola Fellows on the outskirts of Brighton in 1986. At the Old Bailey, Joel Bennathan QC said Nicola's dad Barrie had a ""guilty secret"", and Mr Bishop was innocent. Jurors also heard Karen Hadaway's mother had raised concerns about Mr Fellows' behaviour in 1989. The girls were found sexually abused and strangled on the South Downs. During his opening speech at the Old Bailey, defence lawyer Mr Bennathan said police had spent ""32 years building a case against the wrong man"". ""Only one person is on trial here sitting in the dock - Russell Bishop,"" he said. ""But the law allows a defendant like him to point out facts, ask questions, to the jury that might suggest the possibility that another person exists who may have carried out these awful attacks. ""We will ask questions of witnesses to show that when the girls went missing there was someone very close to them who has no alibi. ""That someone has a guilty secret - that he has been complicit in the sexual abuse of Nicola Fellows, which shows an interest in paedophilic sex. ""In the end it might mean he could not let Nicola Fellows tell the world what has been happening. That person is her father, Barrie Fellows."" Russell Bishop was cleared of murdering the girls after a trial in 1987 Nicola and Karen were found dead in a wooded den near a landmark called Jacobs Ladder a day after they went missing while playing in Wild Park, near Brighton. Bishop joined a search involving police and volunteers, and asked Karen's mother for an item of her daughter's clothing for his dog to pick up a scent, the court heard. Giving evidence, Karen's mother Michelle Hadaway said she knew the girls had been found when police swarmed the park and a police helicopter went up to search. Under cross-examination, she was also asked about concerns she had raised in 1989 about Nicola's father Barrie Fellows. She had written a letter to her local councillor and Bishop's uncle outlining her fears about his ""strange and unnatural behaviour"". He allegedly told her it was ""lucky Karen had not been beaten before she died"", which she found strange as it came before she had been told what happened. Also giving evidence, Nicola's mother Susan Fellows - now Eisman - told jurors her daughter ""was dotty over her father but was also wary of him"". She said Nicola ""knew what he said went"", and if she was naughty he would slap her. In a recent statement, she described hearing of sexual allegations about her daughter from Bishop's girlfriend but said she did not dare speak to Mr Fellows about it. She was also asked about a past incident involving her grandmother, who Mr Fellows had struck on the nose after she said ""something about not liking [him]"". No charges were pressed at the time. The Court of Appeal had ordered a fresh trial in light ofnew DNA evidence incriminating Bishop, after he was initially cleared of the girls' murders in 1987. Three years after his acquittal, Bishop was convicted of the kidnap, indecent assault and attempted murder of a seven-year-old girl at Devil's Dyke, also on the South Downs. Bishop, formerly from Brighton, East Sussex, has denied two charges of murder.

Raphael Kennedy, 31, waited more than an hour to dial 999 after inflicting 39 injuries on Dylan Tiffin-Brown. He beat the toddler, who had five different drugs in his system when he died, in a fit of temper, Northampton Crown Court heard. Kennedy was given a life term afterbeing found guilty of murder. During a three-week trial, he had told the court he was ""not the perfect parent"" and admitted he made his living dealing crack cocaine and heroin. He said he had been selling drugs in the lead-upto the fatal attack at his flat in Arthur Street on 15 December. When Dylan was taken to hospital, Kennedy initially told paramedics that he had ""tripped and fell over"". Sentencing, Mrs Justice Sue Carr said: ""Whatever triggered the assault, you lost your temper with him and inflicted a savage and sustained attack on him. ""You undoubtedly beat Dylan in a fit of anger or stress so hard as to fracture his ribs and tear his liver.Â You used some sort of object to beat his arms. ""Dylan would have been in agony, bewildered and terrified. Slowly his condition would have deteriorated before your eyes, going from screaming and crying to curling up and trying to avoid movement."" Mrs Justice Carr said Kennedy's failure to call an ambulance for his son, whom he had only met for the first time 10 weeks earlier, deprived him of any hope of survival. Kennedy, who described Dylan as his ""little bestie"" in court, told an ""elaborate web of lies"" and his story ""chopped and changed with the wind"", she said. ""The truth has now caught up with you,"" she added. Dylan had five different types of drug in his body when he died, including cocaine and heroin As well ashaving heroin and cocaine in his system,Dylan also had multiple fractures, lacerations to his liver and substantial abdominal injuries that would have left him in significant pain. But Det Ch Insp Ally White, from the East Midlands Special Operations Unit, said three nationally-recognised experts all agreed Dylan's ""catastrophic"" injuries could not be explained by ""a simple fall"". In a statement, Dylan's mother said he was ""the most perfect little boy you could ever meet"". She said: ""He had a smile as bright as the sun, his eyes were crystals like the stars above and his love was the best feeling in the world. ""Knowing I won't get to hold my baby again leaves a pain like no other."" Police had raided Kennedy's flat on 18 October - two month's before Dylan's murder - and found heroin, cocaine and cannabis as well as a phone, scales and packaging used for drug dealing. A serious case review by the Northamptonshire Safeguarding Children's board about Dylan's death is expected to be published next month.

"Campaigners gave Doctor Kids as an example of a title in which a character cries if players click away from an in-app store Under-fives are being blitzed with app-based ads which are often manipulative, inappropriate or deceptive, according to a coalition of campaign groups. Examples given include a character crying if the child does not pay to unlock part of a game, and an app promoting another title that showed a cartoon of the US president trying to press a ""nukes"" button. More than20 groups have called on US regulators,externalto launch an official probe. A UK charity has also urged action. The calls were prompted following a reportby the University of Michigan's Medical School into the phenomenon,external. Its researchers reviewed a total of 135 apps available via Google's Play Store, which are marketed to or played by children under five. Of these, 85 were ""free"" and had some sort of advertising. The other 50 - of which 88% had ads - were paid for. ""Our findings show that the early childhood app market is a wild west, with a lot of apps appearing more focused on making money than the child's play experience,""commented the study's senior author,externalJenny Radesky. ""I'm concerned about digital disparities as children from lower-income families are more likely to play free apps, which are packed with more distracting and persuasive ads."" The university study raised several concerns about the game Strawberry Shortcake Bake Shop The study gives several examples of advertising techniques which it thinks raise concern: use of commercial characters - in Paw Patrol: Air and Sea Adventures it says some characters show facial expressions of disappointment when the player does not choose locked items teasers - in the free version of Balloon Pop it says the user is shown fancier-than-normal balloons, but if selected a sound effect and written text state that they are only available in the full app interruptions - in Kids Animal Jigsaw it says pop-up ads appear every time the player completes a puzzle, meaning they take up about as much time as gameplay character encouragement - in Strawberry Shortcake Bake Shop it says the protagonist always states how much better the locked pay-to-use tools are than the free ones unsuitable ads - one unnamed app was said to feature banner adverts for bipolar disorder treatments and Instagram, which has a 13+ age limit camouflaged items - in Talking Tom it says that a present falls from the ceiling which appears to be part of the game but is actually a prompt to ""watch videos and win"" Most of the developers involved have yet to comment, but the team behind Talking Tom have acknowledged the problem. ""We received feedback that some of the ads in our games could be interpreted as misleading,"" said Outfit7. ""Unfortunately, what we thought was clear to our users, was not. Consequently, we will be taking immediate action... [and will be] clearly marking the rewarded video placements."" The campaign groups also presented further examples of their own that they said were concerning. Olaf's Adventures is said to feature glowing cakes that when tapped bring up a store They included Disney's Olaf Adventures - based on the movie Frozen - which is said to feature glowing cakes which take players to a store despite not being marked as ads. Edbuzzkids' Sight Words was also highlighted for prompting players to click on ads by using cartoon hands to guide them to a banner. In addition, the groups said the ""x"" used to close out of ads in several apps was very small, meaning children were likely to tap outside it and be led to a purchase screen or app store instead. ""The blurred lines between ads and entertainment may simply overwhelm the defences children are still in the process of building,"" the groups wrote to the Federal Trade Commission. ""In short, preschool children are vulnerable to advertising and benefit from clear separation of ads and programming content. Yet many of the ads on pre-school apps would be difficult even for adults to identify. ""It is deceptive to target young children with ads in this way."" The chief executive of Childnet, a London-based internet safety charity, said British authorities might also need to re-examine the issue. ""This issue and the questions raised are just as relevant in the UK,"" Will Gardner told the BBC. ""If advertising is aimed at children who are too young to distinguish advertising from other content for example, then there is a clear issue to address."" The matter falls under the remit of the Advertising Standards Authority in the UK. Its current rules focus on whether adsmight cause distress or include age-restricted products,external. Google has issued a statement saying that it already operates rules to protect young users. ""Apps primarily directed to children must participate in ourDesigned for Families Programme,externaland must follow more stringent requirements, including content and ad restrictions, and provide a declaration that they comply with all applicable privacy laws"" a spokeswoman said. ""Additionally, Google Play discloses whether an app has advertising or in-app purchases, so parents can make informed decisions."" The study's authors said they had not tested iOS apps and were unclear whether iPhone users faced similar issues. However, they noted that Apple's guidelines state that ""apps must not include links out of the app, purchasing opportunities, or other distractions to kids unless reserved for a designated area behind a parental gate"". ""It is unknown whether iOS apps adhere to these guidelines,"" they added. Apple has not commented on the issue.

"Billionaire Mike Ashley has announced a deal to buy Evans Cycles which will see half of the bike chain's shops close, resulting in hundreds of job losses. The struggling firm was placed into administration before being sold to Sports Direct International. Mr Ashley, who founded Sports Direct, said: ""In order to save the business, we only believe we will be able to keep 50% of stores open in the future."" Evans, which is nearly 100 years old, has 62 shops and employs 1,300 people. It emerged last month that the retailer was seeking a rescue deal, with accountancy firm PwC brought in as advisers. Matt Callaghan, joint administrator and a partner at PwC, said it had been a very difficult year for Evans following the cold snap at the start of 2018 and a lack of cash to invest in stores and online. ""A combination of losses, the capital expenditure requirements and tightening credit has led to a liquidity crunch,"" he said. Evans is the second retailer that Mr Ashley's firm has rescued in as many months. In August, Sports Direct paid Â£90m to buy House of Fraser shortly after the department store chain entered administration. By Dearbail Jordan With this latest deal - to rescue bike chain Evans Cycles - billionaire businessman Mike Ashley has returned to the sports and outdoor roots that have mostly dominated his career. After establishing Sports Direct in 1982, Mr Ashley has built his business through buying up well-known names such as Dunlop Slazenger, outdoor gear specialist Karrimor, hat-maker Kangol and the boxing brand Lonsdale. Mike Ashley is the founder and chief executive of Sports Direct Sports Direct also owns the iconic London sports store Lillywhites and Mr Ashley - widely reported to be a Tottenham fan - owns Newcastle United football club. But the Evans Cycles deal is notable for another reason. As more retailers fall, the wider Mike Ashley's control of Britain's High Streets spreads. His portfolio includes House of Fraser and luxury fashion chain Flannels as well as major shareholdings in Debenhams and French Connection. Mr Ashley even controls Agent Provocateur which, like House of Fraser and Evans, he bought after the upmarket lingerie chain went intro administration. What isn't clear is what Mr Ashley's strategy is. Is there method to his investments or is it some kind of Monopoly board power grab? Perhaps the next deal - because undoubtedly there's bound to be another in the not too distant future - will make things clearer. James Keany at commercial property firm CBRE, which is advising Sports Direct on Evan Cycles, said: ""We are looking forward to working with landlords in order to help create a sustainable business. ""We will make contact with landlords over the next few days and discuss the future of individual stores."" Cyclist Frederick Evans opened a shop - FW Evans Cycles - on Kennington Road in south London in 1921 He died in a road accident in 1944 The business was acquired by Joseph Smith in the 1950s and sold bikes as well as toys. His son Gary took over some 20 years later and returned it to a specialist cycling outlet and oversaw its expansion Active Private Equity bought a controlling stake in the company for about Â£35m in 2008 In 2015 Evans was sold to private equity firm ECI Partners in a deal valuing it at about Â£75m Ashley sacks House of Fraser management Evans Cycles seeks new owner amid cash crunch Wildfire sweeps through Hollywood Hills and threatens landmarks as chaos grips LA Paris Hilton among stars 'heartbroken' as she watches home 'burn to ground' Commuters warned of icy roads as cold snap continues to freeze UK Sound Of 2025: Ezra Collective are 'keeping music real' The Papers: 'Apocalypse' LA and 'Reeves faces extra tax rises' How Australia's beach cabana drama sparked a turf war H-1B: Visa row under Trump fuels anxiety for Indian dreamers 'I thought I was going to die': Jailed Venezuelan activist details brutality of prison life The man who could become Canada's future PM 'Trump 2.0' looms large over the global economy A politician was shot dead in Bangkok.

"The Rosenthal brothers, the first to be buried, were the youngest victims of the synagogue shooting The first of the 11 victims of the US shooting at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh have been laid to rest. Hundreds paid their respects on Tuesday at the funerals of brothers Cecil and David Rosenthal and Jerry Rabinowitz, who were killed on Saturday. President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump visited Pittsburgh to pay their respects amid a large protest by hundreds of people. Critics said the president's trip drew attention away from the funerals. As President Trump arrived, demonstrators chanted: ""President hate, leave our state."" Mr Trump and the first lady visited the scene of the massacre on Tuesday ""Trump, Renounce White Nationalism Now,"" read one sign. Another said: ""Trump's lies kill."" During the president's visit to the synagogue one protester holding a baby was seen by reporters calling to Mr Trump's motorcade: ""We didn't invite you here."" Mr Trump was accompanied on by his son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner, who is Jewish, and Mr Kushner's wife, Ivanka Trump, a convert to Judaism. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who is also a Jew, joined the president, too. A long line has formed outside the Rodef Shalom Congregation ahead of the first funeral service for the victims Some Jewish figures and Pittsburgh's Democratic mayor Bill Peduto have opposed the presidential visit. The 11 worshippers were shot and killed at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in what is thought to be the worst anti-Semitic attack in US history. Six other people were injured. An anti-Trump protest has drawn over 1,000 residents Lines of mourners stretched for several blocks at the public services on Tuesday. Brothers David and Cecil Rosenthal, who were aged 54 and 59, were among the first to be buried. They were the youngest victims of the shooting. During a prayer service for the brothers, Rabbi Myers reportedly told the packed service: ""They could illustrate a dictionary definition for 'pure souls.'"" Jerry Rabinowitz, 66, was also buried on Tuesday. He was a doctor in the Squirrel Hill community, particularly known for his work with gay men diagnosed with HIV. On Saturday, he was shot and killed after he rushed to help the wounded, his nephew Avishai Ostrin said in an emotional Facebook post. Protesters against Mr Trump's visit held signs saying 'words matter' and 'renounce white nationalism' ""When he heard shots he ran outside to try and see if anyone was hurt and needed a doctor,"" he wrote. ""That was Uncle Jerry, that's just what he did."" Daniel Stein, 71, was also buried in a private service on Tuesday. Pittsburgh shooting: Who were the victims? Pittsburgh shooting 'will not break us' As the Pittsburgh Jewish community plans for the victims' funerals, which are scheduled all week, support has been pouring in from across the country. A GoFundMe fundraiser created by an Iranian refugee studying in Washington DC, who has no connection to the Pittsburgh community, has already received over $839,000 (Â£658,000) to help rebuild the synagogue and support victims' families. Women embrace outside the Rodef Shalom Congregation where the funeral for shooting victims Cecil Rosenthal and David Rosenthal are being held Another fund set up by Muslim-American groups to help pay for funeral costs has raised over $195,000. The Jewish Federation of Greater Pittsburgh said people had donated over $205,000, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reported. More than 70,000 people signed an open letter from Pittsburgh-based Jewish leaders saying that President Trump was ""not welcome"" in the city unless he ""fully denounces white nationalism"". The White House has rejected any blame over the attack. Jared Kushner, Ivanka Trump and Steven Mnuchin accompanied Mr Trump on the trip US Vice-President Mike Pence also provoked controversy after a cleric whose views are shunned by mainstream Jews led prayers for victims at a Republican rally on Monday. Anger at 'Jesus prayer' for Jewish victims Known as Messianic Jews, the movement is shunned by mainstream Judaism. Social media users were angered by the presence of a figure whose movement is viewed by mainstream Judaism as a branch of evangelical Christianity.

"Pharrell Williams has told US President Donald Trump to stop playing his music at political events. The warning comes after the US leader attended a rally in Indiana on Saturday where the song Happy was played.

A letter issued through Pharrell's lawyer said there was nothing ""happy"" about the tragedy and ""no permission was granted"" to use the song. Tributes have been left at a synagogue in Pittsburgh where the attack happened The shooting took place at the Tree of Life Synagogue and is being called the worst anti-Semitic attack in US history. The11 victims were aged between 54 and 97and included a husband and wife. Pharrell issued a cease-and-desist letter through his lawyer urging the US leader to stop playing his music.

"This video can not be played Is your food destroying Brazil's savanna? ""Exploding human consumption"" has caused a massive drop in global wildlife populations in recent decades, the WWF conservation group says. In a report,external, the charity says losses in vertebrate species - mammals, fish, birds, amphibians and reptiles - averaged 60% between 1970 and 2014. ""Earth is losing biodiversity at a rate seen only during mass extinctions,"" the WWF's Living Planet Report adds. It urges policy makers to set new targets for sustainable development. The Living Planet Report, published every two years, aims to assess the state of the world's wildlife. 'Shocking' human impact on protected areas Why Guyana's rainforests are a scientist's dream Alarm as China eases ban on rhino horn use The 2018 edition says only a quarter of the world's land area is now free from the impact of human activity and the proportion will have fallen to just a 10th by 2050. The change is being driven by ever-rising food production and increased demand for energy, land and water. Although forest loss has been slowed by reforestation in some regions in recent decades, the loss has ""accelerated in tropical forests that contain some of the highest levels of biodiversity on Earth"", the report notes. It says South and Central America suffered the most dramatic decline in vertebrate populations - an 89% loss in vertebrate populations compared with 1970. Marine freshwater species are particularly at risk, the report says. Plastic pollution has been detected in the deepest parts of the word's oceans, including the bottom of the Mariana Trench in the Pacific. Ocean plastic could triple in decade Welsh wildlife at risk Freshwater species - living in lakes, rivers and wetlands - have seen an 83% decline in numbers since since 1970, according to the report. This video can not be played The Truth Behind My Fried Chicken The WWF calls for ""a new global deal for nature and people"" similar to the 2015 Paris agreement to tackle climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions. ""Decision makers at every level need to make the right political, financial and consumer choices to achieve the vision that humanity and nature thrive in harmony on our only planet,"" the report says. The data, gathered from peer-reviewed studies, covers more than 16,700 populations belonging to 4,000 species around the world. The WWF's methodology has been criticised. One conservationist told the BBC in 2016 that thedata in the 2016 report was skewed towards western Europe, where figures were more readily available. By Robert Cuffe, Head of Statistics, BBC News This report shows that many species are dwindling at an alarming rate. But it doesn't tell us that we've lost 60% of our wildlife. The Living Planet Index looks at the falls in each species, rather than in the total wildlife population. A huge percentage fall in a rare species will not make much difference to the total number of animals in the world. But it will make a difference to the average fall. Imagine there were only two species in the world: frogs and pandas. Say that fecund frogs, whose numbers remain in the millions, see zero fall. The poor, prudish pandas whose shyness has seen their number drop from 100 to only 20 see an 80% fall. On average, there would be an average fall in the populations of species of 40%. But the total population of animals would not be much changed. The former is what the Living Planet Index tells us about: how much individual species are growing or shrinking. But that is not the same as stripping 40% (or 60%) of wildlife from the planet.

"Campaigners gave Doctor Kids as an example of a title in which a character cries if players click away from an in-app store Under-fives are being blitzed with app-based ads which are often manipulative, inappropriate or deceptive, according to a coalition of campaign groups. Examples given include a character crying if the child does not pay to unlock part of a game, and an app promoting another title that showed a cartoon of the US president trying to press a ""nukes"" button. More than20 groups have called on US regulators,externalto launch an official probe. A UK charity has also urged action. The calls were prompted following a reportby the University of Michigan's Medical School into the phenomenon,external. Its researchers reviewed a total of 135 apps available via Google's Play Store, which are marketed to or played by children under five. Of these, 85 were ""free"" and had some sort of advertising. The other 50 - of which 88% had ads - were paid for. ""Our findings show that the early childhood app market is a wild west, with a lot of apps appearing more focused on making money than the child's play experience,""commented the study's senior author,externalJenny Radesky. ""I'm concerned about digital disparities as children from lower-income families are more likely to play free apps, which are packed with more distracting and persuasive ads."" The university study raised several concerns about the game Strawberry Shortcake Bake Shop The study gives several examples of advertising techniques which it thinks raise concern: use of commercial characters - in Paw Patrol: Air and Sea Adventures it says some characters show facial expressions of disappointment when the player does not choose locked items teasers - in the free version of Balloon Pop it says the user is shown fancier-than-normal balloons, but if selected a sound effect and written text state that they are only available in the full app interruptions - in Kids Animal Jigsaw it says pop-up ads appear every time the player completes a puzzle, meaning they take up about as much time as gameplay character encouragement - in Strawberry Shortcake Bake Shop it says the protagonist always states how much better the locked pay-to-use tools are than the free ones unsuitable ads - one unnamed app was said to feature banner adverts for bipolar disorder treatments and Instagram, which has a 13+ age limit camouflaged items - in Talking Tom it says that a present falls from the ceiling which appears to be part of the game but is actually a prompt to ""watch videos and win"" Most of the developers involved have yet to comment, but the team behind Talking Tom have acknowledged the problem. ""We received feedback that some of the ads in our games could be interpreted as misleading,"" said Outfit7. ""Unfortunately, what we thought was clear to our users, was not. Consequently, we will be taking immediate action... [and will be] clearly marking the rewarded video placements."" The campaign groups also presented further examples of their own that they said were concerning. Olaf's Adventures is said to feature glowing cakes that when tapped bring up a store They included Disney's Olaf Adventures - based on the movie Frozen - which is said to feature glowing cakes which take players to a store despite not being marked as ads. Edbuzzkids' Sight Words was also highlighted for prompting players to click on ads by using cartoon hands to guide them to a banner. In addition, the groups said the ""x"" used to close out of ads in several apps was very small, meaning children were likely to tap outside it and be led to a purchase screen or app store instead. ""The blurred lines between ads and entertainment may simply overwhelm the defences children are still in the process of building,"" the groups wrote to the Federal Trade Commission. ""In short, preschool children are vulnerable to advertising and benefit from clear separation of ads and programming content. Yet many of the ads on pre-school apps would be difficult even for adults to identify. ""It is deceptive to target young children with ads in this way."" The chief executive of Childnet, a London-based internet safety charity, said British authorities might also need to re-examine the issue. ""This issue and the questions raised are just as relevant in the UK,"" Will Gardner told the BBC. ""If advertising is aimed at children who are too young to distinguish advertising from other content for example, then there is a clear issue to address."" The matter falls under the remit of the Advertising Standards Authority in the UK. Its current rules focus on whether adsmight cause distress or include age-restricted products,external. Google has issued a statement saying that it already operates rules to protect young users. ""Apps primarily directed to children must participate in ourDesigned for Families Programme,externaland must follow more stringent requirements, including content and ad restrictions, and provide a declaration that they comply with all applicable privacy laws"" a spokeswoman said. ""Additionally, Google Play discloses whether an app has advertising or in-app purchases, so parents can make informed decisions."" The study's authors said they had not tested iOS apps and were unclear whether iPhone users faced similar issues. However, they noted that Apple's guidelines state that ""apps must not include links out of the app, purchasing opportunities, or other distractions to kids unless reserved for a designated area behind a parental gate"". ""It is unknown whether iOS apps adhere to these guidelines,"" they added. Apple has not commented on the issue.

"Malware was found on many of the 9,000 websites visited by the employee The porn habit of an employee at the US Geological Survey (USGS) led to a government network becoming infected with malware,an official report,externalhas revealed. The employee, who has not been named, had ""an extensive history of visiting adult pornography websites"". Investigators found malware on many of the 9,000 pages he or she accessed. The US Office of the Inspector General has recommended that the USGS blacklist ""rogue"" websites.

"Teachers and parents have reacted with anger to an announcement in the Budget that schools are to receive aone-off payment of Â£400m for ""little extras"". Schools in England will receive the sum to ""buy the little extras they need"", Chancellor Philip Hammond said. Shadow education secretary Angela Rayner said Mr Hammond's choice of language was ""utterly insulting to parents and teachers"". Unions said Mr Hammond's gesture would ""infuriate"" head teachers. Mr Hammond's announcement comes as England's school leaders have been campaigning for better funding for schools, saying their budgets have been squeezed. Hammond: 'Austerity coming to an end' Richer or poorer? Ask the calculator How the budget affects you if you're young Laura Kuenssberg: The Budget's big picture emerges Campaign group Save Our Schools described Mr Hammond's offer as ""patronising"" and a ""big mistake"". The hash tag ""littleextras"" began trending on social media after the Budget, with some parents pointing out the cash injection was less than the Â£420m the chancellor had allocated to fixing potholes.

Speaking to BBC Breakfast, the chancellor hit back at claims his announcement suggested he did not understand the problems facing schools. Mr Hammond said he had ""provided a little bonus to every school"", which he hoped ""would be welcome"". He added he would be ""sending a cheque to every school"" and he knew the schools in his constituency - Runnymede and Weybridge, in Surrey - would be ""quite happy"" with the money. Mr Hammond also insisted the Â£400m announced in the Budget was separate from long-term schools funding, which he said would be addressed in the spending review next year. While the chancellor admitted some departments could face cuts in the spending review, he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the other option was that ""everybody"" would get a 0% increase in funding, once inflation was taken into account.

However, teachers on the TES forum complained Mr Hammond's announcement made it seem ""like these 'little extras' are a treat or a bonus"", adding: ""A pack of dry wipe pens or glue sticks are essentials that a lot of schools are finding it harder to afford."" Another poster wrote: ""Photocopying must cost a fortune but as we have no text books we do more of it. All the computers are on their last legs. We are short of chairs so have to grab them from other rooms if we can. Half the gas taps in my lab haven't worked in over a year."" Head teachers' polite protest over funding 'Squeeze continues' for low income families Writing for Schoolsweek,external, former government adviser on education Jonathan Simons said Mr Hammond's announcement was phrased ""in the manner of which a 1950s husband may have given his wife some pin money"". The money is worth, on average, Â£10,000 per primary school and Â£50,000 per secondary school, the chancellor said. But Emily Proffitt from Tittensor First School in Staffordshire told BBC Radio 5 Live that, even in her ""very small rural school"", Â£10,000 would not account for 1% of her budget. She added the sum would not be able to fund the ""things we are absolutely desperate for"", such as better provision for people with special educational needs or teachers' salaries. Meanwhile, shadow chancellor John McDonnell told BBC Breakfast there was ""no new money for the day to day running of schools"". He continued: ""People have been really angered by that. They're saying: 'We've been laying off teachers and teaching assistants, we can't afford the books, the pencils, the crayons.'"" Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: ""While we welcome any increased investment in schools, the Â£400m 'bonus' announced today hardly scratches the surface of what is needed."" School leaders' union NAHT said: ""This is a Budget that will infuriate school leaders. Schools and young people are most definitely much too far down the government's list of priorities.""

"The day we've been waiting for all year has finally come around - thebudget's been announced. Ok - that might be a stretch but the government has outlined what it's going to do with its money for the next few years. Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond stood in Parliament for more than an hour explaining all the changes he's making to the country's finances. Here are some of the most important bits that may affect you. Nope, we can't talk about anything right now without mentioning Brexit. The Chancellor announced that he's keeping an extra Â£500m back in case Brexit goes badly. That means he's got about Â£4.4bn stashed away to pay for any problems the UK has as a result of Brexit. If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, we'll get an emergency budget before the scheduled leave day of 29 March. That's the last time we'll mention Brexit - promise. First, here's how your pay will be affected. The amount of your wage you get tax-free - known as the personal allowance - is going up from Â£11,850 to Â£12,500 a year from April 2019. Philip Hammond says that will mean most people will get around an average of Â£130 more a year in their pay packets. The national living wage (the minimum amount over-24s can earn) is also going up, from Â£7.83 to Â£8.21 an hour. The national minimum wage (for 18 to 24-year-olds) will increase, although the Chancellor didn't announce by exactly how much. Earlier in the year, Prime Minister Theresa May announced an extra Â£20.5bn would go to the NHS in England over the next five years. Now, Philip Hammond has explained where some of that money will go, including Â£2bn towards mental health spending. He's announced a new 24-hour mental health hotline. He's also spoken about more ""mental health ambulances"" - special vehicles used to treat people having a mental health episode. Jeremy Corbyn says the chancellor's promise to spend more on mental health is not enough. He says experts reckon the new money is ""only half of what is needed"". What is universal credit - and what's the problem? Universal credit is a system to merge six major benefits together, including unemployment and housing benefits. But many people have had a difficult time going from benefits to universal credit. Payments have been delayed, which have left some people out of pocket as they make the transitions. To try to smooth this, Philip Hammond has announced an extra Â£1bn for the next five years. Austerity is the series of budget cuts and tax rises made by the government since 2010, which includedcuts to departmentslike transport and local government. The ""era of austerity is finally coming to an end,"" said Philip Hammond in his budget speech. He's announced that government spending will start going back up again. But just saying it doesn't mean that austerity suddenly goes away. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said in response: ""Austerity is not over."" He added: ""This budget won't undo the damage done by eight years of austerity."" A new tax will be introduced on big tech companies, which would include firms like Google and Facebook. The Chancellor says it will come into force in 2020, and will raise about Â£400m a year. But it may never actually come into place, as a group of rich countries - including the UK - is alsoplanninga similar tax. So if that tax comes in, the UK's tax won't be used. Make sense? Jeremy Corbyn says that tax is ""too little, too late"". Follow Newsbeat onInstagram,external,Facebook,externalandTwitter,external.

"The Rosenthal brothers, the first to be buried, were the youngest victims of the synagogue shooting The first of the 11 victims of the US shooting at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh have been laid to rest. Hundreds paid their respects on Tuesday at the funerals of brothers Cecil and David Rosenthal and Jerry Rabinowitz, who were killed on Saturday. President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump visited Pittsburgh to pay their respects amid a large protest by hundreds of people. Critics said the president's trip drew attention away from the funerals. As President Trump arrived, demonstrators chanted: ""President hate, leave our state."" Mr Trump and the first lady visited the scene of the massacre on Tuesday ""Trump, Renounce White Nationalism Now,"" read one sign. Another said: ""Trump's lies kill."" During the president's visit to the synagogue one protester holding a baby was seen by reporters calling to Mr Trump's motorcade: ""We didn't invite you here."" Mr Trump was accompanied on by his son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner, who is Jewish, and Mr Kushner's wife, Ivanka Trump, a convert to Judaism. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who is also a Jew, joined the president, too. A long line has formed outside the Rodef Shalom Congregation ahead of the first funeral service for the victims Some Jewish figures and Pittsburgh's Democratic mayor Bill Peduto have opposed the presidential visit. The 11 worshippers were shot and killed at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in what is thought to be the worst anti-Semitic attack in US history. Six other people were injured. An anti-Trump protest has drawn over 1,000 residents Lines of mourners stretched for several blocks at the public services on Tuesday. Brothers David and Cecil Rosenthal, who were aged 54 and 59, were among the first to be buried. They were the youngest victims of the shooting. During a prayer service for the brothers, Rabbi Myers reportedly told the packed service: ""They could illustrate a dictionary definition for 'pure souls.'"" Jerry Rabinowitz, 66, was also buried on Tuesday. He was a doctor in the Squirrel Hill community, particularly known for his work with gay men diagnosed with HIV. On Saturday, he was shot and killed after he rushed to help the wounded, his nephew Avishai Ostrin said in an emotional Facebook post. Protesters against Mr Trump's visit held signs saying 'words matter' and 'renounce white nationalism' ""When he heard shots he ran outside to try and see if anyone was hurt and needed a doctor,"" he wrote. ""That was Uncle Jerry, that's just what he did."" Daniel Stein, 71, was also buried in a private service on Tuesday. Pittsburgh shooting: Who were the victims? Pittsburgh shooting 'will not break us' As the Pittsburgh Jewish community plans for the victims' funerals, which are scheduled all week, support has been pouring in from across the country. A GoFundMe fundraiser created by an Iranian refugee studying in Washington DC, who has no connection to the Pittsburgh community, has already received over $839,000 (Â£658,000) to help rebuild the synagogue and support victims' families. Women embrace outside the Rodef Shalom Congregation where the funeral for shooting victims Cecil Rosenthal and David Rosenthal are being held Another fund set up by Muslim-American groups to help pay for funeral costs has raised over $195,000. The Jewish Federation of Greater Pittsburgh said people had donated over $205,000, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reported. More than 70,000 people signed an open letter from Pittsburgh-based Jewish leaders saying that President Trump was ""not welcome"" in the city unless he ""fully denounces white nationalism"". The White House has rejected any blame over the attack. Jared Kushner, Ivanka Trump and Steven Mnuchin accompanied Mr Trump on the trip US Vice-President Mike Pence also provoked controversy after a cleric whose views are shunned by mainstream Jews led prayers for victims at a Republican rally on Monday. Anger at 'Jesus prayer' for Jewish victims Known as Messianic Jews, the movement is shunned by mainstream Judaism. Social media users were angered by the presence of a figure whose movement is viewed by mainstream Judaism as a branch of evangelical Christianity.

"Irish passport holders will retain EU travel benefits after Brexit The number of British applications for an Irish passport has boomed following the UK's vote to leave the European Union. Some UK residents are entitled to an Irish passport if their parents or grandparents were born in Ireland. In 2015, the year before the Brexit vote, more than 46,000 applications were lodged from Britain - excluding Northern Ireland. By the end of 2017 that number had nearly doubled to 81,000. In an earlier version of this story, the BBC wrongly reported there had also been a surge in the number of rejections of British applicants. A discrepancy between the number of applications made and passports issued through the London embassy amounted to some 15,000 people. However, Ireland's Department of Foreign Affairs said that figure did not represent the number of passport applications refused. Instead it reflects the fact that not all applications from residents are submitted via the London embassy, it said. The actual number of rejected applications is not clear. Applications can be rejected for a range of reasons including incomplete applications or uncertain identity. Citizens of the Republic of Ireland, an EU member state, will retain visa-free travel benefits after Brexit, no matter the outcome of the UK's negotiations with the EU. In the first five months of this year, almost 45,000 British people had requested an Irish passport,  according to figures from Neale Richmond, Chair of the Irish Senate's Brexit committee. London's Irish embassy has issued more than 176,000 since 2016 - more than 10 times that of any other office. Mr Richmond said embassy staff were expecting 2018 to be the busiest year ever.

"This video can not be played Charles Lawson became emotional while talking about the incident on BBC Breakfast Actor Charles Lawson, best known as Jim McDonald on Coronation Street, has said he was diagnosed with exhaustion before suffering a mini-stroke on stage. A doctor asked him whether he would consider pulling out of playing Ian Rankin's detective Rebus, he said. But Lawson responded that he would ""feel like a chicken"" if he did. He went on to have the stroke mid-show in Edinburgh this month. ""I knew I hadn't a clue what was happening, and then it just all went black,"" he said. Lawson is now back on tour in Rebus - Long Shadows with co-stars Cathy Tyson and John Stahl, and told BBC Breakfast he feels ""very well"". The doctor who originally diagnosed his exhaustion asked how he would feel about pulling out. ""And I couldn't because I was playing bloody Rebus,"" Lawson said. He told viewers who may be in a similar position to ""listen to your alarm bells"". Lawson was also seen back on Coronation Street in September He saw the doctor before the show opened in Birmingham in September. ""I didn't sleep properly for a month,"" Lawson said. ""I lost a stone. [On] press night we opened and everything was fine and all reviews were good."" After two weeks in Birmingham, the show went on tour. Lawson said: ""First night in Edinburgh. Packed house. Second half, Cathy, John and myself were on stage. There's a 35-page scene, the climax of the piece, and I was looking at John and I was aware very quickly something was wrong. ""I went deaf. The colour changed - my vision changed."" Cathy Tyson plays a detective inspector in the show He said he could hardly see Tyson, and thought Stahl was messing about by reciting lines from a different play. ""I remember feeling annoyed,"" he said. ""And I remember moving to where I should have been, and there was a piece of me that knew something was wrong. ""And then big John just put his arm around me and said, 'Come on big lad, off you go'."" He told the audience on 8 October he thought he was going to faint,according to a review in The Edinburgh Evening News,external, and was replaced by an understudy for the rest of the show. Lawson went backstage and said he felt fine within 20 minutes, but scans the following day revealed the transient ischemic attack (TIA) - or mini-stroke. ""I haven't had time to deal with it,"" he said. ""I haven't had time to sit down and think because two days later I was back on stage."" The show is now at Manchester's Opera House and still has to tour in Northampton, Aberdeen and Guildford. ""I need to sit down and think about it,"" he added. ""It is a great show and Ian loves it, which is the key to all of us. We've got four weeks to go, and then I'm going on holiday. ""Celebrities can whinge a lot but I'm not like that. I don't whinge, but I knew I was exhausted and I know I'm exhausted and when I finish this it's up to the Highlands for me. No signal, no phone, two dogs and my beautiful [wife] Debbie, who's looked after me."" A TIA is a temporary disruption in the blood supply to part of the brain, according to the NHS.

"This video can not be played Debris found from Lion Air crash in sea Drones and sonar technology have been deployed in Indonesia to search for a Lion Air passenger plane which crashed into the sea on Monday. Flight JT 610 went down after taking off from Jakarta with 189 passengers and crew on board. There has been no sign of survivors but debris and personal belongings have been collected from the water. There is no indication yet of what caused the plane to go down 13 minutes after taking off. Officials say the pilot of the Boeing 737, which was heading for the western city of Pangkal Pinang, had asked to return to Soekarno-Hatta airport shortly before losing contact with air traffic control. Baby shoes are among some of the debris that has been found A log obtained by the BBCshowed the plane had encountered technical problems while flying from Bali to Jakarta the previous day. The log showed one instrument was giving ""unreliable"" airspeed readings and the captain had to hand over to the first officer. Altitude readings also differed on the captain and first officer's instruments. Lion Air's chief executive Edward Sirait said on Tuesday that the plane had been repaired before taking off again. Indonesian officials shared technical maps of the area being searched By Rebecca Henschke, BBC News, Jakarta Another day of waiting for the families and loved ones of those on board. Now they sit outside Jakarta's police hospital where bodies are being brought. Lion Air is providing free flights from Bangka for families, like Surya's. ""They have all come hoping for some closure and certainty,"" she says.  Her younger sister was on the plane. ""We want a body to grieve. She was the youngest in our family, so we all loved her very much. It feels very painful to lose the baby of the family."" Outside the hospital I meet Murtado Kurinawan, whose newly-wed wife was on the plane, travelling for work. He has brought her toothbrush in the hope it will help with the identification process.  ""I can't stop thinking about her. Her face fills my mind all the time,"" he said. The plane plunged in coastal waters that are about 30m (100ft) deep north-east of Jakarta. Investigators say they are hopeful of finding the main fuselage. Search teams are using an underwater drone, as well as underwater ""pinger locators"" to try to pick up the sonar signals from the cockpit recorders. How could a brand new plane crash? Mourning siblings and mystery couple on ill-fated plane Search teams have been retrieving body parts, aircraft debris and personal items. Body bags are being taken to Jakarta for identification. Another search official, Yusuf Latif, earlier said it would be ""a miracle"" if survivors were found.

"This video can not be played The Budget headlines in two minutes from Andrew Neil The Budget has been branded ""a bit of a gamble"" by a respected economic research group. The chancellor was able to promise more spending in his budget after forecasts for tax collection were raised, the Institute for Fiscal Studies said. But those forecasts could easily change for the worse, leaving the chancellor in a tight spot, the IFS said. The think tank also warned that many public services will continue to feel squeezed for some time to come. ""This is no bonanza,"" said Paul Johnson, the director of the IFS. ""If I were a prison governor, a local authority chief executive or a head teacher, I would struggle to find much to celebrate. I would be preparing for more difficult years ahead."" Health spending is the exception, with Â£20bn extra funding promised to help the NHS and pay for mental health services. Speaking to the BBC's Today programme earlier, the Chancellor, Philip Hammond, defended his spending decisions. He said that taken as a whole, other departments would see their spending rising in line with inflation. At-a-glance summary Budget row over 'ending austerity' What it means for you Hammond hails better borrowing figures Tech giants face digital services tax Contractors face higher tax and NI payments Budget calculator In her speech to the Conservative Party conference in October, Prime Minister Theresa May promised an end to austerity. The IFS said it was not clear yet whether austerity is over. It pointed out that Â£4bn of cuts to welfare spending were still working their way through the system. A judgement on austerity also depends on what is measured, according to the IFS. While total spending, including the effect of inflation, is set to rise, spending as a fraction of national income will fall slightly. Mr Johnson also said this Budget showed the government had abandoned its target to get rid of the gap between spending and income - the deficit - in the near future. ""Any idea that there is a serious desire to eliminate the deficit by the mid-2020s is surely for the birds."" This chancellor is seemingly content to let the deficit float up. That would have, until relatively recently, been considered heresy round his way. Politically, it's a big change of priority and has allowed the government to change its rhetoric substantially. But if you look carefully, a huge amount of that money will be gobbled up quickly by the health service.

"This video can not be played The Budget headlines in two minutes from Andrew Neil The Budget has been branded ""a bit of a gamble"" by a respected economic research group. The chancellor was able to promise more spending in his budget after forecasts for tax collection were raised, the Institute for Fiscal Studies said. But those forecasts could easily change for the worse, leaving the chancellor in a tight spot, the IFS said. The think tank also warned that many public services will continue to feel squeezed for some time to come. ""This is no bonanza,"" said Paul Johnson, the director of the IFS. ""If I were a prison governor, a local authority chief executive or a head teacher, I would struggle to find much to celebrate. I would be preparing for more difficult years ahead."" Health spending is the exception, with Â£20bn extra funding promised to help the NHS and pay for mental health services. Speaking to the BBC's Today programme earlier, the Chancellor, Philip Hammond, defended his spending decisions. He said that taken as a whole, other departments would see their spending rising in line with inflation.

The IFS said it was not clear yet whether austerity is over. It pointed out that Â£4bn of cuts to welfare spending were still working their way through the system. A judgement on austerity also depends on what is measured, according to the IFS. While total spending, including the effect of inflation, is set to rise, spending as a fraction of national income will fall slightly. Mr Johnson also said this Budget showed the government had abandoned its target to get rid of the gap between spending and income - the deficit - in the near future. ""Any idea that there is a serious desire to eliminate the deficit by the mid-2020s is surely for the birds."" This chancellor is seemingly content to let the deficit float up. That would have, until relatively recently, been considered heresy round his way. Politically, it's a big change of priority and has allowed the government to change its rhetoric substantially.

"The era of austerity is not over for working families on benefits or government departments like transport, according to one of the first independent analyses of the Budget. The Resolution Foundation said Philip Hammond had delivered Â£55bn in tax cuts and increases in public spending. It said that richer households would feel the most positive effects. However, the report highlighted that many of the cuts to welfare announced in 2015 are still to be rolled out. That includes the Â£1.5bn benefits freeze for people in work which the foundation said would see a low income couple with children up to Â£200 a year worse off. The Resolution Foundation, a not-for-profit research and policy organisation, said it was the top 10% of households that would gain most - around Â£410 a year - from the decision to increase the amount people can earn before they start paying income tax and the higher rate of tax. Poorer households would gain around Â£30 a year. Speaking to the BBC's Today programme, the chancellor pointed out that he had allocated an extra Â£6.5bn for Universal Credit and raised the Living Wage. ""If you look at all the measures in the Budget - and we've done this very carefully - you will see that it is those on the lowest incomes that proportionately benefit the most,"" he said. The Resolution Foundation said that with borrowing far lower than expected and economic growth predicted to be slightly higher over the next two years, Mr Hammond decided to spend three quarters of the Â£74bn extra headroom that was provided by the better public finances. ""The chancellor was able to navigate the near impossible task in his Budget of easing austerity, seeing debt fall and avoiding big tax rises, thanks to a Â£74bn fiscal windfall,"" said Torsten Bell, the director of the foundation. ""He chose to spend the vast majority of this on the NHS, income tax cuts and a welcome boost to Universal Credit. ""But while yesterday's Budget represented a seismic shift in the government's approach to the public finances, it spelt an easing rather than an end to austerity - particularly for low and middle income families."" At-a-glance summary What it means for you Hammond hails better borrowing figures Tech giants face digital services tax Contractors face higher tax and NI payments Budget calculator Mr Bell said the chancellor had made ""very welcome"" commitments to helping people on the new Universal Credit benefit but that three-quarters of the benefit cuts announced in 2015 were still to take effect. ""Income tax cuts announced yesterday will overwhelmingly benefit richer households, with almost half of the long-term gains going to the top 10% of households,"" Mr Bell said. ""On public services the NHS saw a big spending boost - but unprotected departments still have further cuts pencilled in."" This Budget has certainly seen a turnaround in the government's approach to the public finances - with day-to-day spending per person set to rise by 4% a year until 2023 - in contrast with a 4% fall previously planned. In his Budget yesterday, Mr Hammond said that the ""hard work"" of the British people was paying off ""and the era of austerity was finally coming to an end"".

"This video can not be played The Cerrado savanna is an area in Brazil the same size as Western Europe. It's one of the most biodiverse places in world - 40% of animal and plant species there can be found nowhere else on the planet. A report by the WWF says it is being burned and cleared at speed, with the deforestation largely driven by demand for land to grow soybeans. These are mainly exported to feed livestock, such as pigs and chickens, for consumption around the world. WWF says an area the size of Greater London disappeared every two months between 2013 and 2015, making the Cerrado one of the most endangered ecosystems on the planet.

"This video can not be played Harry and Meghan take on welly-wanging The Duchess of Sussex showed off her ""welly-wanging"" skills on the latest stop of her 16-day tour with Prince Harry. The pair indulged in some rubber boot tossing in Redvale, north of the New Zealand city of Auckland. The couple were on competing teams, and Meghan emerged victorious after her welly was thrown a metre closer to the target than Prince Harry's. The royal couple have also been to Australia, Tonga and Fiji on the tour. The couple arrived in New Zealand on Sunday. Nelson Poll, 11, was one of the young people who taught Prince Harry and Meghan welly-wanging. He said: ""I think Harry's technique was better, it was straight forward instead of going at an angle."" The Duke and Duchess of Sussex then headed to Auckland where they were joined by New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern. Ms Ardern, who had her first child in June, said she had not shared any baby tips with the royal couple but admired the duchess for her work while pregnant. She said: ""It's just increased my respect for the role that she's playing at such an often tiring time. I have real empathy and I think she's incredible."" Ms Ardern also said that New Zealand had ""a real affinity"" with the royal family, adding that there had been ""a real connection between particularly William and Harry in recent years"". Jacinda Ardern joined the royal couple on a walkabout on Viaduct Harbour The Duke and Duchess of Sussex visited a charity, Pillars, which supports children who have a parent in prison New Zealand's prime minister hosted a reception for Prince Harry and Meghan The southern hemisphere tour began two weeks ago with the royal couple announcing they were expecting a child. They also launched this year's Invictus Games, a multi-sport event founded by the prince to help wounded service personnel and veterans with their physical and psychological rehabilitation. The duke, who served in the Army for 10 years, launched the games in 2014. This year it was held in Sydney, Australia. The royal couple's final stop on their tour will be Rotorua, a city on the north island of New Zealand, on Wednesday.

"Mothers should wait at least a year between giving birth and getting pregnant again to reduce health risks to mother and baby, a new study says. But researchers say they need not wait as long as the 18 months recommended in the current World Health Organization guidelines. Small gaps between pregnancies risk premature births, smaller babies and infant and mother mortality. The researchers hope the findings will be ""reassuring"" for older women. Senior study author Dr Wendy Norman said it was ""encouraging news"" for women over 35 who were planning their families. ""Older mothers for the first time have excellent evidence to guide the spacing of their children,"" she said. ""Achieving that optimal one-year interval should be doable for many women and is clearly worthwhile to reduce complication risks."" The study, of nearly 150,000 births in Canada, by University of British Columbia (UBC) and the Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health is published inJAMA Internal Medicine.,external The study found 12-to-18 months was the ideal length of time between giving birth and becoming pregnant again. Current World Health Organization guidelines recommend an ideal interval of 24 months and no fewer than 18 months. The researchers also found: Getting pregnant less than 12 months after giving birth was associated with risks for women for all ages There were risks to the mother only for women over the age of 35, while risks to the infant were found for all women, but were greatest for those aged between 20 and 34 Women over 35 who conceived six months after a previous birth had a 1.2% risk of maternal mortality or harm (12 cases per 1,000 pregnancies) Waiting 18 months between pregnancies reduced the risk to 0.5% (five cases per 1,000) Younger women who got pregnant six months after a previous birth had an 8.5% risk (85 cases per 1,000) of premature labour This dropped to 3.7% (37 per 1,000) if they waited 18 months between pregnancies The study's lead author, Laura Schummers, said: ""Our study found increased risks to both mother and infant when pregnancies are closely spaced, including for women older than 35. ""The findings for older women are particularly important, as older women tend to more closely space their pregnancies and often do so intentionally."" The study looked at only one population of women - in Canada - so it is unclear how applicable this would be worldwide. Researcher Dr. Sonia Hernandez-Diaz said the findings suggested different risks for each age group. ""Short pregnancy spacing might reflect unplanned pregnancies, particularly among young women. ""Whether the elevated risks are due to our bodies not having time to recover if we conceive soon after delivering or to factors associated with unplanned pregnancies, like inadequate prenatal care, the recommendation might be the same: improve access to postpartum contraception, or abstain from unprotected sexual intercourse with a male partner following a birth."" Mandy Forrester, from the Royal College of Midwives, said the study was ""useful research and builds on previous research into birth spacing"". ""Ultimately, it will be a woman's choice, whatever age they are, about how long they leave between their pregnancies. What is important is that they are aware of the evidence around birth spacing and that they make their choice armed with the right information. ""Health professionals will always support a woman in her choice, which will be about what is right for them and their pregnancy. She said women needed access to contraceptive advice to allow them to space their births, if that was their choice, but said in specialist family planning service provision in the UK was ""patchy, with GPs frequently offering only oral contraception"". ""Specialist services should be available for all women."" Babies most likely to be born at 4am The two-year baby gap - is it ideal?

"Italy has been battered by fierce winds and rain which have left 11 people dead in the west and north, while schools and tourist sites closed in several regions amid fears for people's safety. Winds of up to 180km/h (110 mph) were reported, and two tornadoes ripped through the centre of the coastal town of Terracina, killing one person and leaving 10 others injured. In the canal city of Venice, rising floodwaters overwhelmed many of its famed squares and walkways, with officials saying as much as 75% of the city is now submerged. Venice's central St Mark's Square was closed on Monday afternoon, after the water level reached ""acqua alta"" (high water) of 156cm (5.1ft).  It is the fourth highest level ever recorded. Some people took to the raised wooden walkways that are installed when there is flooding. Shopkeepers worked to try to keep the water away from their stock. Beyond Venice in the north, it was a story of high winds, fallen trees and landslides. In the wider Veneto region, a man was killed by a tree and a volunteer fireman died in the north-eastern border region of Alto Adige, also known as South Tyrol. A 61-year-old man was found dead in a river near Belluno, Veneto, close to where his car had been discovered earlier. A woman was killed when her home was hit by a landslide and a fisherman's body was found hours after he went to check on his boat on a lake in Trento. South of the beach resort of Rimini, a kite-surfer aged 63 died when he was hurled against rocks. Across Italy six people died on Monday and further deaths were confirmed on Tuesday. Some of the worst conditions were reported on the west coast, particularly in Liguria in the north-west. The outer breakwater wall in the fashionable port of Rapallo was destroyed as its reinforced concreted crumbled, causing damage to some of the prize yachts moored at the resort. Firefighters had to go to the rescue of 19 people after they became trapped in Rapallo. Further south, the coastal province of Grosseto said it had suffered a ""calamitous"" event, while trees fell down the capital Rome and further south in Naples, where a 21-year-old student was killed. Two tornadoes tore roofs from buildings in Terracina south of Rome, as residents ran for cover. Meteorologists are warning that the bad weather will continue. Transport and power supplies have been disrupted too. All pictures copyright Â© 2025 BBC.

"This video can not be played Debris found from Lion Air crash in sea Drones and sonar technology have been deployed in Indonesia to search for a Lion Air passenger plane which crashed into the sea on Monday. Flight JT 610 went down after taking off from Jakarta with 189 passengers and crew on board. There has been no sign of survivors but debris and personal belongings have been collected from the water. There is no indication yet of what caused the plane to go down 13 minutes after taking off. Officials say the pilot of the Boeing 737, which was heading for the western city of Pangkal Pinang, had asked to return to Soekarno-Hatta airport shortly before losing contact with air traffic control. Baby shoes are among some of the debris that has been found A log obtained by the BBCshowed the plane had encountered technical problems while flying from Bali to Jakarta the previous day. The log showed one instrument was giving ""unreliable"" airspeed readings and the captain had to hand over to the first officer. Altitude readings also differed on the captain and first officer's instruments. Lion Air's chief executive Edward Sirait said on Tuesday that the plane had been repaired before taking off again. Indonesian officials shared technical maps of the area being searched By Rebecca Henschke, BBC News, Jakarta Another day of waiting for the families and loved ones of those on board. Now they sit outside Jakarta's police hospital where bodies are being brought. Lion Air is providing free flights from Bangka for families, like Surya's. ""They have all come hoping for some closure and certainty,"" she says.  Her younger sister was on the plane. ""We want a body to grieve. She was the youngest in our family, so we all loved her very much. It feels very painful to lose the baby of the family."" Outside the hospital I meet Murtado Kurinawan, whose newly-wed wife was on the plane, travelling for work. He has brought her toothbrush in the hope it will help with the identification process.  ""I can't stop thinking about her. Her face fills my mind all the time,"" he said. The plane plunged in coastal waters that are about 30m (100ft) deep north-east of Jakarta. Investigators say they are hopeful of finding the main fuselage. Search teams are using an underwater drone, as well as underwater ""pinger locators"" to try to pick up the sonar signals from the cockpit recorders. How could a brand new plane crash? Mourning siblings and mystery couple on ill-fated plane Search teams have been retrieving body parts, aircraft debris and personal items. Body bags are being taken to Jakarta for identification. Another search official, Yusuf Latif, earlier said it would be ""a miracle"" if survivors were found.

"The RMT has said it is appalled that high-speed trains being brought into service in Scotland will dump human waste onto train tracks. The rail union said the practice,which had ceased after a deal with ScotRail in 2017, would result in its members being ""sprayed with human waste"". The trains are being used as an interim measure pending the arrival of a new fleet of refurbished trains. ScotRail described the situation as ""far from ideal"". The rail operator said that of 10 newly-refurbished trains due to come into service in December, only one had arrived from contractor Wabtec. It said the delay in the order meant ""classic"" high-speed trains that did not have waste tanks would operate on timetabled routes linking Scotland's seven cities instead. Currently the only route that has a train fitted with a waste tank is the service running between Aberdeen and Edinburgh. A deal between the RMT, Transport Scotland and ScotRail had ended the dumping of human waste onto rail tracks in December last year. A deal to stop dumping human waste was agreed and implemented in December 2017 RMT general secretary Mick Cash said: ""Our members are rightly appalled that ScotRail have sought to rip-up a clear agreement to end the filthy and disgusting practice of dumping human excrement on Scotland's railways. ""This disgraceful and retrograde step must be halted now and the union will take whatever action is required to hold ScotRail to their agreement with the union. ""One minute ScotRail are bragging about their aim to operate the most modern railway in the world and the next they are back to spraying track workers with human waste."" A ScotRail spokesman acknowledged that it was likely to be some time before newly refurbished trains with human waste tanks would be ready. In a statement, the company said: ""We are working flat out to get more upgraded trains into service as quickly as possible, but our supplier, Wabtec, is behind schedule and has let us down. ""To ensure we can deliver services for our customers we will introduce classic high-speed trains until enough upgraded Inter7City trains are available. ""These classic trains will not have retention tanks, which is far from ideal. We are doing everything we can to mitigate this as soon as possible."" A Transport Scotland spokeswoman said it completely sympathised with unions over the issue. She added: ""The Scottish government has directly funded previous installation programmes to eradicate this practice across ScotRail fleets. ""We understand this interim measure is regrettable, but necessary to support more services and jobs across the country while retaining passenger services between our key seven cities. ""Wabtec must deliver their work as soon as possible, so passengers and staff can benefit from these improvements."" A spokeswoman for Wabtec said the company did not wish to comment on the issue.

"The Restaurant Group, the owners of the Frankie & Benny and Garfunkel's restaurant chains, has struck a deal to buy Asian-themed chain Wagamama. The deal values the business, which opened its first restaurant in central London in 1992, at Â£559m. The Restaurant Group said,externalWagamama had ""consistently and significantly outperformed its core UK market."" It plans to expand the chain, which it says is well placed to capitalise on the trend for healthy eating. The Restaurant Group (TRG) owns a number of well-known fast-casual dining chains, including Chiquito and Joe's Kitchen. Outlets in this sector have struggled recently, along with others on the High Street, with a number of well-known chains either falling into administration or striking deals with creditors. Burger chain Byron, Jamie's Italian and Prezzo have been among those closing branches and shedding staff. Reasons for the downturn include higher raw material costs, partly due to the weaker pound since the Brexit vote, waning consumer spending power and higher business rates. However, TRG says Wagamama, which is currently owned by the Duke Street and Hutton Collins private equity firms, has a ""strong competitive advantage"" as it is three times the size of its nearest rival, and is therefore the only substantial UK pan-Asian brand concept with scale. Wagamama's now has 196 directly-operated and franchised restaurants, with about two-thirds in the UK, and its most-recent figures show same-store sales growth rose by 9.6%. The chain is chaired by Allan Leighton, who has been chief executive of supermarket chain Asda and chairman of Royal Mail, among many other senior high-profile roles. He will now also join the board of TRG. First one opened in Bloomsbury, Central London, 1992 Inspired by Japanese noodle bars Pioneered communal bench seated tables Has 133 outlets in UK Total of 196 outlets includes restaurants in the US, New Zealand, Middle East, Romania and Croatia Inspired a short story - After Wagamama but Mostly Before, by Toby Litt ""Wagamama is a fantastic brand, with a market-leading pan-Asian proposition, which has consistently outperformed the casual dining market in recent years,"" said TRG chief executive Andy McCue. TRG will fund the takeover through a combination of cash, debt and issuing more shares. News of the plan had pushed its shares down 14% by mid-morning. Greg Johnson, analyst at Shore Capital, said the deal made sense, as TRG's Frankie & Benny's chain had not been thriving: ""The acquisition increases its [TRG's] exposure to fast-growing channels, i.e. away from Frankie & Benny's, to 70% from just over half at present, and we would expect this trend to continue. ""The deal significantly transforms the [TRG] investment case, which should lead to faster growth and reduce its exposure to the structurally challenged parts of the group.""

"A professor of surgery says students have spent so much time in front of screens and so little time using their hands that they have lost the dexterity for stitching or sewing up patients. Roger Kneebone, professor of surgical education at Imperial College, London, says young people have so little experience of craft skills that they struggle with anything practical. ""It is important and an increasingly urgent issue,"" says Prof Kneebone, who warns medical students might have high academic grades but cannot cut or sew. ""It is a concern of mine and my scientific colleagues that whereas in the past you could make the assumption that students would leave school able to do certain practical things - cutting things out, making things - that is no longer the case,"" says Prof Kneebone. The professor, who teaches surgery to medical students, says young people need to have a more rounded education, including creative and artistic subjects, where they learn to use their hands. Do smartphones really affect surgeons' skills? Prof Kneebone says he has seen a decline in the manual dexterity of students over the past decade - which he says is a problem for surgeons, who need craftsmanship as well as academic knowledge. ""An obvious example is of a surgeon needing some dexterity and skill in sewing or stitching,"" he says. ""A lot of things are reduced to swiping on a two-dimensional flat screen,"" he says, which he argues takes away the experience of handling materials and developing physical skills. Such skills might once have been gained at school or at home, whether in cutting textiles, measuring ingredients, repairing something that's broken, learning woodwork or holding an instrument. Students have become ""less competent and less confident"" in using their hands, he says. ""We have students who have very high exam grades but lack tactile general knowledge,"" says the professor. Prof Kneebone will be speaking on Tuesday at the V&A Museum of Childhood in east London, at the launch of a report, published by the Edge Foundation, calling for more creativity in the curriculum. Alice Barnard, chief executive of the Edge education charity, says: ""The government pays lip service by saying creative subjects are important, but its policies demonstrate otherwise."" She says the way school performance is measured tends to push schools to focus on core academic subjects, to the detriment of arts and creative subjects. The report warns that entries to creative subjects have fallen by 20% since 2010, including a 57% fall in design and technology GCSE. Tristram Hunt, director of the Victoria and Albert Museum, will be speaking alongside Prof Kneebone. ""Creativity is not just for artists. Subjects like design and technology, music, art and drama are vitally important for children to develop imagination and resourcefulness, resilience, problem-solving, team-working and technical skills,"" says Mr Hunt. ""These are the skills which will enable young people to navigate the changing workplace of the future and stay ahead of the robots, not exam grades.""

"Daniela Tejada has repeatedly rejected suggestions her husband, Matthew Hedges, is a spy A British academic accused of spying by the United Arab Emirates (UAE) has been released on bail. Matthew Hedges, a 31-year-old PhD student at Durham University, was arrested on 5 May in Dubai and has reportedly been held in solitary confinement for almost six months. He denies spying for the UK government. Mr Hedges has been told to remain in the UAE until his next court appearance on 21 November and has not had his passport returned to him. He is being made to wear an ankle monitor and was warned that, if instructed, he may have to return to jail. Mr Hedges' wife Daniela Tejada said he was tired and ""shocked by everything"" but was in a good mood and ""glad to be breathing fresh air"". Speaking to the BBC, she called the move a ""great step"" but said she was ""still hoping for justice"". ""However, I cannot allow myself to get too excited by this information as Matt is not fully free yet,"" she added. More than 100 academics from around the world have signed a petition demanding the release of Mr Hedges Mr Hedges was detained at Dubai Airport as he was leaving the country following a research trip. His family said he had been researching the impact of the Arab Spring on the UAE's foreign policy and security strategy when he was arrested. Mr Hedges and his family said he was entirely innocent of the charges. His wife, who lives in Exeter, added: ""Above everything, I hope that justice will be done and Matt is granted his rightful freedom, something that he's been unjustly denied in the last six months. ""My main concern is his safety and I'd like to request the FCO [Foreign Office] and UAE authorities ensure that he's protected during this time."" A spokeswoman for the Foreign Office said it was ""monitoring developments closely and have made the Emirati authorities aware of all our concerns"". ""Our staff are in close contact with Matthew's wife, Daniela, offering her all possible support at what we appreciate is a hugely difficult time,"" she added.

"Excluded schoolchildren are at serious risk of becoming involved in knife crime, a children's charity has warned. Barnardo's says excluded children are also at risk of ""being groomed and exploited by criminal gangs"". The charity said 47 councils, about one in three in England, had no spaces in pupil referral units (PRU), which look after excluded children. The government said a review of school exclusions and their impact on children was ongoing. The research, which was carried out in collaboration with the All Party Parliamentary Group on Knife Crime, shows a 56% rise in exclusions in England since 2014. The group's chairwoman, Sarah Jones, said knife crime was at its highest level on record and ""our schools are on the front line"". She added: ""Exclusions are rising and in many cases there is literally nowhere for those children to go. This is heartbreaking."" She said excluded children were ""marked as failures"", and added professionals often talk about the ""PRU to prison pipeline"". Barnardo's chief executive, Javed Khan, said: ""We know children excluded from mainstream schools are at serious risk of being groomed and exploited by criminal gangs."" He urged the government to reduce the number of pupils excluded from schools and to improve alternative provisions so ""vulnerable young people get the help they need to achieve of positive future"". A government spokesperson said: ""Permanently excluding a child from mainstream school should only ever be a last resort, and we support teachers in making these difficult decisions where they are justified."" They added the government was undergoing a review of exclusions led by the former education minister Edward Timpson.

"The era of austerity is not over for working families on benefits or government departments like transport, according to one of the first independent analyses of the Budget. The Resolution Foundation said Philip Hammond had delivered Â£55bn in tax cuts and increases in public spending. It said that richer households would feel the most positive effects. However, the report highlighted that many of the cuts to welfare announced in 2015 are still to be rolled out. That includes the Â£1.5bn benefits freeze for people in work which the foundation said would see a low income couple with children up to Â£200 a year worse off. The Resolution Foundation, a not-for-profit research and policy organisation, said it was the top 10% of households that would gain most - around Â£410 a year - from the decision to increase the amount people can earn before they start paying income tax and the higher rate of tax. Poorer households would gain around Â£30 a year. Speaking to the BBC's Today programme, the chancellor pointed out that he had allocated an extra Â£6.5bn for Universal Credit and raised the Living Wage. ""If you look at all the measures in the Budget - and we've done this very carefully - you will see that it is those on the lowest incomes that proportionately benefit the most,"" he said. The Resolution Foundation said that with borrowing far lower than expected and economic growth predicted to be slightly higher over the next two years, Mr Hammond decided to spend three quarters of the Â£74bn extra headroom that was provided by the better public finances. ""The chancellor was able to navigate the near impossible task in his Budget of easing austerity, seeing debt fall and avoiding big tax rises, thanks to a Â£74bn fiscal windfall,"" said Torsten Bell, the director of the foundation. ""He chose to spend the vast majority of this on the NHS, income tax cuts and a welcome boost to Universal Credit. ""But while yesterday's Budget represented a seismic shift in the government's approach to the public finances, it spelt an easing rather than an end to austerity - particularly for low and middle income families."" At-a-glance summary What it means for you Hammond hails better borrowing figures Tech giants face digital services tax Contractors face higher tax and NI payments Budget calculator Mr Bell said the chancellor had made ""very welcome"" commitments to helping people on the new Universal Credit benefit but that three-quarters of the benefit cuts announced in 2015 were still to take effect. ""Income tax cuts announced yesterday will overwhelmingly benefit richer households, with almost half of the long-term gains going to the top 10% of households,"" Mr Bell said. ""On public services the NHS saw a big spending boost - but unprotected departments still have further cuts pencilled in."" This Budget has certainly seen a turnaround in the government's approach to the public finances - with day-to-day spending per person set to rise by 4% a year until 2023 - in contrast with a 4% fall previously planned.

"The dust hasn't quite settled but we're a good few hours on from when the chancellor squeezed himself back down onto the government front bench, in between a pleased-looking prime minister and his ever-enthusiastic colleague Liz Truss, his number two at the Treasury. A few hours when certainly not everything has become clear, no doubt a few nasties will crawl out from under the rocks through the course of tomorrow according to Budget tradition, but the broad shape of the Budget and its impact are becoming clear. Hammond: 'Austerity coming to an end' Tech giants face digital services tax First off, it is, on the face of it, a big change in direction - a Tory chancellor talking about turning on the spending taps again, rather than how to scrimp and save. You'll see headlines about the 'biggest giveaway' in a generation. That's accurate in terms of the overall numbers, and the sense that government departments on average from next year will see spending go up not down. And it's different certainly to see a Conservative resident of No 11 putting that ahead of finishing off the attempts to clear the deficit. This chancellor is in fact seemingly content to let the deficit float up. That would have, until relatively recently, been considered heresy round his way. Politically, it's a big change of priority and has allowed the government to change its rhetoric substantially. But if you look carefully, a huge amount of that money will be gobbled up quickly by the health service. After that, by some calculations, there simply won't be much to go around - and some departments might even still face cuts. This sets the stage for a brutal spending review next year with Cabinet ministers, apart from the health secretary Matt Hancock, still vying to be the ones who can get their hands on extra money. For those who fail, and more importantly those who rely on the services delivered by their departments and local councils, the spending squeeze won't have come to an end at all. Budget calculator 2018 - what it means for you How the budget affects you if you're young For spending hawks like the chancellor however, together with his next door neighbour in Number 10, today is perhaps about grappling with a political reality - that the public appetite for austerity is much diminished, if not completely exhausted. But this is a return to spending, not an enormous splurge. Ministers will still have to contend with tight limits on spending and the economy is still predicted to grow at a pretty sluggish rate. Offering tax cuts more quickly by raising income tax thresholds immediately after Brexit will put money into millions of voters' pockets, perhaps just at the right time (remember though those tax cuts put a lot more in the wallets of the wealthy than basic rate payer). And as a senior Cabinet minister claimed this afternoon, the Budget creates a new, ""useful"" dividing line (yes one of those old Westminster chestnuts) with the Labour Party in the months and years to come. Instead of the basic - Tory cuts versus Labour spending - after today, both parties would spend more on public services but the Tories will do it without raising taxes. That, they hope, could become a persuasive Tory pitch to most voters in the middle, who don't want to hand over a lot more of their incomes to the government, but don't want to see teachers disappearing at their school, potholes in their roads, or wait for hours at A&E. That hope could be just that, a hope. The forecasts on which today's Budget is based could turn out to be as wrong as those that have gone before. Eight years of a squeeze on spending, particularly in local government, can't be unpicked overnight. The questions about Brexit persist, not just over the economy but over the chancellor and prime minister's futures too. If the next few months unfurl as they hope, and they are still around, it is now clear where they would like to put down their anchor. But it's up to the rest of the EU, the wider fortunes of the economy, and ultimately the public, to determine if they can.

"The study suggests football participation has a measurable impact on the nation's health Playing football prevents over 8,000 cases of cardiovascular disease a year, according to a Uefa-commissioned study. The report for European football's governing body also calculated that the game delivers a return of more than Â£1.25bn to Scottish society. The research is the first of its kind looking at the social and economic impact of football. It suggests our national game contributes more than Â£200m directly into the Scottish economy. The Scottish FA said it proved the game's worth to society and said it also hoped it would lead to increased government and private funding. Compiled in conjunction with a number of leading universities, the report in full will be delivered to cabinet ministers by representatives of the Scottish FA later. The key figures from the report suggest football contributes: Â£200m to the economy Â£300m worth of social benefits, including crime reduction Â£700m worth of health benefits Scottish FA chief executive Ian Maxwell said the report provided proof that our national game is a key part of Scottish society. ""The professional game in this country will always take a lot of focus but I think, to a large degree, we take grass roots football for granted,"" he said. ""It's not until you see something like this and the numbers involved, the volunteer hours that are given up on an annual basis that you realise football is saving lives and making lives better. ""This really helps sharpens people's focus."" The Scottish FA believes the report justifies investing in the national stadium at Hampden About 780,000 people in Scotland play football and around 89% of those participants are male. The study suggests that one of the greatest impacts of the sport can be seen in the area of mental health. A figure of Â£40m a year is suggested for the financial impact - with the report suggesting 5,000 cases of mental health issues are prevented each year. Andrew Watson, from Aberdeen, is involved in the Grampian Strikers project, a group set up through the Aberdeen FC community trust to bring together people who have struggled with their mental health. He was sectioned twice and suffered from paranoid thoughts but he believes football has been a key aspect of his recovery. ""For a lot of us, it's the highlight of our week,"" he said. ""You go there knowing a lot of the other players have had similar problems to yourself so they can probably relate on a deeper level."" The Scottish FA hopes the findings will lead to more funding, not just for grass roots football and health initiatives, but for other areas such as the proposed upgrade of the national stadium. ""I think it's just part if the wider benefit of football,"" Mr Maxwell said. ""That can take a number of forms - obviously we are going to own the stadium soon and obviously there will be opportunities to see how we can best use that and how that can be tied in to some of the issues in this report. We hope that can be the case.""

"This video can not be played Christian Marbach tells the BBC it is hard to accept his grandfather's murder An ex-nurse in Germany has admitted at the start of his trial that he murdered 100 patients, making him one of the world's most prolific serial killers. Detectives say Niels HÃ¶gel administered fatal doses of medication to the people in his care - causing cardiac arrest - at two hospitals in northern Germany. His motive, prosecutors say, was to impress colleagues by trying to revive the very patients he had attacked. HÃ¶gel, 41, is already serving a life term for six deaths while in his care. He is now said to have killed 36 patients in Oldenburg and 64 in nearby Delmenhorst between 1999 and 2005. Niels HÃ¶gel hid his face from the cameras in court on Tuesday He was later seen being led to a police vehicle When asked by the judge in the Oldenburg court if the charges against him were true, the 41-year-old confessed to ""more or less"" all of them. The current trial, which started with a minute's silence for the victims, is expected to last until May. It follows years of toxicology tests on 130 sets of exhumed remains. By Jenny Hill, BBC News, Berlin Dozens of relatives of those who died at the hands of Niels HÃ¶gel were in court to hear his confession. Many of them are demanding to know how he was able to kill - with apparent impunity - so many people in the confines of two hospitals. Death rates rose significantly during HÃ¶gel's time. Disturbing details have emerged: it's been widely reported that HÃ¶gel was allowed to continue working for two days after he was caught ""red handed"" having administered drugs to a patient, during which time he killed another patient. Many relatives believe health authorities chose to turn a blind eye. An investigation is under way to determine whether their actions facilitated the murderous ambitions of post-war Germany's most prolific serial killer. Investigators say he may have killed even more but potential victims have been cremated. Christian Marbach, a spokesperson for relatives, said it was a scandal the ex-nurse had been allowed to kill with impunity for years without officials intervening. ""We fought for four years for this trial and expect HÃ¶gel is sentenced for another 100 murders,"" said Mr Marbach, whose grandfather was killed by HÃ¶gel. ""I hope he will be found guilty on each count so that the loved ones can finally find some closure,"" said Petra Klein, who runs a victims' support group. Relatives of his alleged victims were expected to pack the court but journalists in the room noted many empty seats in reserved rows. HÃ¶gel was first caught in 2005 injecting unprescribed medication into a patient in Delmenhorst. In 2008 he was jailed for seven years for attempted murder. In 2014-15, a second trial found him guilty of two murders and two attempted murdersand he was given the maximum sentence. He said he was ""honestly sorry""and hoped families would find peace. He said the decisions to carry out his crimes had been ""relatively spontaneous"". However, during the trialhe confessed to a psychiatrist that he had killed up to 30 people. Investigators then widened the investigation, exhuming 130 former patients and looking for evidence of medication that could have triggered cardiac arrest. They also pored over records in the hospitals he worked at. Records at the Oldenburg hospital showed rates of deaths and resuscitations had more than doubled when HÃ¶gel was on shift, German media reported.

"A long-running case over the status of Uber drivers will be heard in the Court of Appeal on Tuesday and Wednesday. The taxi-hailing app is contesting an employment tribunal finding that drivers should be treated as workers rather than self-employed. If classified as workers, Uber drivers are entitled to paid holiday and the minimum wage. Unions calculate this could be worth Â£18,000 per driver. Uber said the tribunal ""fundamentally misunderstood"" how it operated. It is the latest stage in a legal battle led by two Uber drivers James Farrar and Yaseen Aslam, who won an employment tribunal in October 2016. After the tribunal ruling in October 2016, Uber appealed to the employment appeal tribunal, but lost in November 2017. The tribunal upheld its original decision that any Uber driver who had the Uber app switched on was working for the company under a ""worker"" contract. Uber is now taking the case to the Court of Appeal, the next stage of the appeal process before the Supreme Court. James Farrar is one of the two drivers at the centre of the case Uber said that 60,000 licensed private hire drivers now use its app across UK. But the case could have implications beyond Uber, according to law firm Leigh Day. ""This appeal is of great significance not only to Uber drivers but also to millions of other workers in the gig economy and we hope that this can now bring this matter to a conclusion for the benefit of all workers,"" said Nigel Mackay, partner at Leigh Day. Law firm Leigh Day started the legal action against Uber on behalf of 25 members of the GMB union, which initially included Mr Farrar and Mr Aslam but they pursed their case with a different union, the IWGB, What is the 'gig' economy? Uber drivers win key employment case Mr Farrar, who is branch chair of the IWGB United Private Hire Drivers branch, said mini-cab drivers were still waiting for justice, two years after the tribunal ruling. ""As the government ignores this mounting crisis, it's been left to workers to fix this broken system and bring rogue bosses to account. If anything gives me hope, it is the rising tide of precarious workers that are organising and demanding a fair deal,"" he said. Uber said it had made changes to give drivers more control over how they use its app. It also cited a study by Oxford University that found drivers make more than the London Living Wage and want to keep the freedom to choose if, when and where they drive. ""Almost all taxi and private hire drivers have been self-employed for decades, long before our app existed.  We believe the Employment Appeal Tribunal last year fundamentally misunderstood how we operate,"" an Uber spokesperson said ""For example, they relied on the assertion that drivers are required to take 80% of trips sent to them when logged into the app, which has never been the case in the UK."" The GMB said Uber should admit defeat. Sue Harris, legal director at GMB, said: ""While the company are wasting money losing appeal after appeal, their drivers are up to Â£18,000 out of pocket for the last two years alone. ""That's thousands of drivers struggling to pay their rent, or feed their families."" The Â£18,000 figure is based on an Uber driver in London working a 40-hour week. Paul Jennings, partner at Bates Wells, the law firm representing Mr Farrer and Mr Aslam, said a key issue in this case was whether Uber had mischaracterised the employment status of its fleet and in so doing failed to observe fundamental employment rights. ""The financial implications of this judgment could be very significant,"" Mr Jennings said. The IWGB said Deliveroo riders, outsourced cleaners, restaurant workers and others in the gig economy would take place in a march on Tuesday to raise the issues facing ""precarious workers"".

"Mothers should wait at least a year between giving birth and getting pregnant again to reduce health risks to mother and baby, a new study says. But researchers say they need not wait as long as the 18 months recommended in the current World Health Organization guidelines. Small gaps between pregnancies risk premature births, smaller babies and infant and mother mortality. The researchers hope the findings will be ""reassuring"" for older women. Senior study author Dr Wendy Norman said it was ""encouraging news"" for women over 35 who were planning their families. ""Older mothers for the first time have excellent evidence to guide the spacing of their children,"" she said. ""Achieving that optimal one-year interval should be doable for many women and is clearly worthwhile to reduce complication risks."" The study, of nearly 150,000 births in Canada, by University of British Columbia (UBC) and the Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health is published inJAMA Internal Medicine.,external The study found 12-to-18 months was the ideal length of time between giving birth and becoming pregnant again. Current World Health Organization guidelines recommend an ideal interval of 24 months and no fewer than 18 months. The researchers also found: Getting pregnant less than 12 months after giving birth was associated with risks for women for all ages There were risks to the mother only for women over the age of 35, while risks to the infant were found for all women, but were greatest for those aged between 20 and 34 Women over 35 who conceived six months after a previous birth had a 1.2% risk of maternal mortality or harm (12 cases per 1,000 pregnancies) Waiting 18 months between pregnancies reduced the risk to 0.5% (five cases per 1,000) Younger women who got pregnant six months after a previous birth had an 8.5% risk (85 cases per 1,000) of premature labour This dropped to 3.7% (37 per 1,000) if they waited 18 months between pregnancies The study's lead author, Laura Schummers, said: ""Our study found increased risks to both mother and infant when pregnancies are closely spaced, including for women older than 35. ""The findings for older women are particularly important, as older women tend to more closely space their pregnancies and often do so intentionally."" The study looked at only one population of women - in Canada - so it is unclear how applicable this would be worldwide. Researcher Dr. Sonia Hernandez-Diaz said the findings suggested different risks for each age group. ""Short pregnancy spacing might reflect unplanned pregnancies, particularly among young women. ""Whether the elevated risks are due to our bodies not having time to recover if we conceive soon after delivering or to factors associated with unplanned pregnancies, like inadequate prenatal care, the recommendation might be the same: improve access to postpartum contraception, or abstain from unprotected sexual intercourse with a male partner following a birth."" Mandy Forrester, from the Royal College of Midwives, said the study was ""useful research and builds on previous research into birth spacing"". ""Ultimately, it will be a woman's choice, whatever age they are, about how long they leave between their pregnancies. What is important is that they are aware of the evidence around birth spacing and that they make their choice armed with the right information. ""Health professionals will always support a woman in her choice, which will be about what is right for them and their pregnancy. She said women needed access to contraceptive advice to allow them to space their births, if that was their choice, but said in specialist family planning service provision in the UK was ""patchy, with GPs frequently offering only oral contraception"". ""Specialist services should be available for all women."" Babies most likely to be born at 4am The two-year baby gap - is it ideal?

"Mulligan was nominated for an Oscar for An Education in 2010 Actress Carey Mulligan has said film and TV sets are still ""limiting"" for mothers who work on them. The Mudbound and Collateral star said she had never worked on a film that had childcare on set and that many pregnant actresses have to ""hide it"". Mulligan has two children with husband Marcus Mumford. ""It's incredibly difficult. Childcare is so expensive,"" she told the Radio Times. ""I've never, ever been on a set where they have childcare."" She added: ""But I've been on lots of sets where lots of people have very young children."" If childcare was available on film sets, ""it would make it possible for a lot of talented people to come and do their job"", she said. ""At the moment, it's limiting."" Mulligan told the magazine that her daughter Evelyn, who was born in September 2015, was with her on the set of her 2017 Oscar-nominated film Mudbound. She said that on her new film Wildlife, ""loads of the crew had kids, but they had to arrange childcare"". She added: ""It's always incredibly complicated."" She filmed BBC Two drama Collateral while pregnant with her son Wilfred, who was born last summer, after the programme's writer Sir David Hare re-wrote her character to make her pregnant. But she said: ""I don't think we're at the level where it's acceptable across the board yet. I think if people can hide it, they do."" McElhone will star alongside Sean Penn in The First Mulligan stars alongside Jake Gyllenhaal in Wildlife as a 1960s wife who begins a relationship with another man as her marriage crumbles. In contrast, fellow British actress Natascha McElhone has said in a separate interview that she found the creator of her latest TV series ""hugely generous and understanding"" about her childcare situation. ""My kids are the centre of my life, and work is something that I fit around them,"" she said. Her husband Martin Kelly died of heart failure 10 years ago when she was pregnant with their third child. McElhone said she had to carefully consider whether to take a role in The First, written by House of Cards creator Beau Willimon. ""Beau is hugely generous and understanding about the complexity of our lives, so that was one of the first things we spoke about when we met, whether it was even possible for me to do this job, because I need to be home, pretty much all of the time,"" she said. ""They shot a lot in my kids' school holidays, so my kids came out [to Louisiana] for a month, which was great. And the rest of the time I commuted.

"Important information on the efficacy of new drugs and treatments is going unpublished, posing a risk to health, says a report by MPs. The House of Commons Science and Technology Committee says despite repeated warnings, not enough is being done to make sure the results of all clinical trials are reported. Nearly half of clinical trials go unreported,evidence suggests,external. It means some clinical decisions are made without all the available data. In some cases, this might endanger human life, says the group of MPs. They give the example of heart drug lorcainide, which was tested in 1980. The results showed that people who were taking it were more likely to die than those who were not, but those findings were not published until 1993 - long after it was made available to patients in the US. The committee also heard that ""publication bias"" may have led to UK public money being wasted, for example when the government's decided to spend Â£424m to stockpile Tamiflu in response to the H1N1 ""swine flu"" epidemic in 2009. Dr Simon Kolstoe, a researcher at the University of Portsmouth and chairman of two ethics committees, told the committee: ""Eight out of the 10 trials that were used by the company to show the drug was useful in preventing complications such as pneumonia had never actually been peer-reviewed or published."" He said this meant governments were ""relying on a marketing spiel claiming successful trials of this drug, rather than being able to consider the actual evidence of the drug efficacy for themselves"". The NHS Health Research Authority (HRA) has been responsible for ""promoting research transparency"" since 2014, but the committee says not enough has been done to improve reporting rates. MPs want the HRA to produce a strategy for fixing this problem and say its performance should be measured against progress. The HRA says it is working with the industry to promote transparency. Committee chairman Norman Lamb said: ""Many of these trials are funded with public money and the taxpayer has a right to expect those who benefit from public funding to follow the rules and publish in full."" He said it was particularly disappointing that trusted bodies such as Public Health England and a range of NHS Foundation Trusts were included in those failing to report results from clinical trials. A trials tracker website,external, called the EU Clinical Trials Register, claims that Public Health England has three overdue trials relating to meningitis vaccination. Dr Mary Ramsay, head of immunisations at Public Health England, said: ""The science and technology committee report, and research published in the BMJ, highlights that we have not complied with the EU Clinical Trials Register reporting requirements for three trials. ""We apologise for this and are putting it right as quickly as possible. ""We are committed to transparency and for two of these studies we have published results publically in academic journals and online atclinicaltrials.gov,external. The samples from a third trial are still being analysed and results will be added to the platform as soon as possible.""

"A Bulgarian passport allows the holder to travel and work throughout the EU Prosecutors in Bulgaria say they have smashed a passport scam which saw thousands fraudulently acquire Bulgarian citizenship - and with it, the right to travel and work throughout the European Union.

"This video can not be played Budget headlines in two minutes Philip Hammond has said the ""era of austerity is finally coming to an end"", in his last Budget before Brexit. He spent a windfall from better public finances on more money for universal credit and bringing forward planned income tax cuts by a year. The personal allowance will rise to Â£12,500 and the higher rate threshold to Â£50,000 in April 2019, worth Â£130 a year for a typical base rate taxpayer. Jeremy Corbyn said whatever Mr Hammond had claimed, ""austerity is not over"". At-a-glance: The Budget key points Budget calculator 2018 - what it means for you How the budget affects you if you're young In a speech lasting more than 70 minutes, Mr Hammond said ""we have reached a defining moment on this long, hard journey"" after repairing the damage to the public finances. He described it as a Budget for ""the strivers, the grafters and the carers,"" promising them a ""brighter future"" after years of constraint. He announced a slight increase in growth forecasts, from 1.3% to 1.6% for 2019, and better-than-expected borrowing figures.

Tech giants face digital services tax The chancellor announced an extra Â£2bn for mental health services in England, as part of the Â£20bn boost to the NHS announced by the government in June. He also unveiled an additional Â£400m to allow schools to ""buy the little extras they need"". This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: ""This is a broken promise Budget"" Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: ""What we've heard today are half measures and quick fixes while austerity grinds on. ""And far from people's hard work and sacrifices having paid off, as the chancellor claims, this government has frittered it away in ideological tax cuts to the richest in our society."" Corbyn - Budget is full of broken promises Labour said the extra money for mental health would ""do little to relieve the severe pressures"" on services caused by the government's ""relentless underfunding of the NHS,"" and the extra Â£20bn for the health service in England was not enough. Labour MPs also reacted angrily to Mr Hammond's promise of a ""little extra"" for schools. Shadow education secretary Angela Rayner tweeted: Allow Twitter content?

The chancellor had been under pressure from Labour and some Tory MPs to put more money into universal credit, amid warnings it could push people into destitution. He announced an extra Â£1bn over five years to help those moving to the new payments, which will replace six in-work benefits, and a Â£1,000 increase in the amount people can earn before losing benefits, at a cost of up to Â£1.7bn a year. He claimed the changes - reversing cuts made in previous Budgets - would make 2.4 million working people and people with disabilities Â£630 a year better off. Labour said the entire Budget should be voted down unless the government agreed to halt the roll-out of universal credit. The dust hasn't quite settled but we're a good few hours on from when the chancellor squeezed himself back down onto the government front bench, in between a pleased-looking prime minister and his ever-enthusiastic colleague Liz Truss, his number two at the Treasury. A few hours when certainly not everything has become clear, no doubt a few nasties will crawl out from under the rocks through the course of tomorrow according to Budget tradition, but the broad shape of the Budget and its impact are becoming clear. Read Laura's blog Mr Hammond warned at the weekend that an emergency Budget would be needed if Britain leaves the EU in March without a deal. However, Downing Street has said all spending plans in this Budget will go ahead ""irrespective"" of Brexit. The big long-term spending decisions will be made next year, after Britain's scheduled departure from the EU. Mr Hammond said overall spending would go up by 1.2% over the next five years. But Treasury officials said this was not a guide to next year's spending review because more money could be available if the UK gets a deal with the EU. And, they added, there was Â£4.2bn in reserve for a no-deal scenario so it was likely spending would go up whatever happened, although the 1.2% figure included the extra money for the NHS. Mr Hammond has said his Budget was based on the assumption of an ""average-type free trade deal"" being agreed between the UK and the EU. He said he was holding back some ""fiscal"" headroom in case he needed to alter his economic plan if Britain leaves the EU without a deal - but that a Brexit agreement with Brussels would result in a ""deal dividend"" for the economy.

He added that ""most of the planned welfare cuts are still on the books"".

"This video can not be played Budget headlines in two minutes Philip Hammond has said there will be no ""real terms"" increase in public spending apart from on the NHS. The chancellor used his Budget on Monday to say that austerity was coming to an end. But Labour's shadow chancellor John McDonnell rejected his claims, saying more welfare cuts were coming and spending was still being squeezed. Mr Hammond chose to spend a windfall from better tax receipts on the NHS, universal credit and income tax cuts. Prime Minister Theresa May said bringing austerity to an end was ""not just about more money into our public services, it is about more money in people's pockets as well"". Budget a bit of a gamble, says IFS LIVE: MPs debate the Budget Budget calculator 2018 - what it means for you At-a-glance summary: Budget key points She said Monday's Budget had put more money into the NHS without raising taxes, adding: ""Indeed, we have cut taxes for 32 million people - the message of yesterday's Budget is that the hard work of the British people has paid-off."" But the Institute for Fiscal Studies said Mr Hammond may have ""painted himself into a corner"" by using a windfall from revised borrowing forecasts to fund increased spending on the NHS. And it warned that tax rises are ""all but inevitable"" in the longer run to pay for the pressure on the NHS of Britain's ageing population. Any expectation that Mr Hammond will now meet his target of eliminating the deficit by the mid-2020s was ""for the birds"", said IFS director Paul Johnson. Kuenssberg: A change in direction 'Squeeze continues' for low income families Pienaar: The political fallout Public spending will go up by 1.2% but most of that will go to the health service in England, Mr Hammond told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. He said next year's spending review would decide how much police, local government, schools, defence and other public services would get. But ""once you take out the commitment we have made to health, (it) gives a flat real spending available for all other departments"". He did not deny that some departments could face cuts but told Today the other option was that ""everybody"" would get a 0% increase in funding, once inflation was taken into account. This video can not be played Philip Hammond is questioned on Today over his one-off Â£400m injection for schools Teachers and parentshave reacted with anger to the announcement,saying schools needed more money for teachers. Labour's shadow education secretary Angela Rayner said Mr Hammond's choice of language was ""utterly insulting to parents and teachers"". Mr Hammond told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the money was a ""one-off"" payment - and he would be looking at overall school spending next year. ""If a school needs to buy a couple of whiteboards or lap top computers or something like that. Having a cheque for Â£50,000 I would have thought would be quite useful for most schools,"" he told Today. The Resolution Foundation, a not-for-profit research and policy organisation, which says its goal is to improve outcomes for people on low and modest incomes, said poorer families would be about Â£30 a year better off from the tax cuts, with the top 10% earners Â£410 better off. The organisation said better than expected public finances had given Mr Hammond an extra Â£74bn to play with - and he had used up three-quarters of that with the extra spending on the NHS, welfare and the income tax changes. The personal allowance will rise to Â£12,500 and the higher rate threshold to Â£50,000 in April 2019, worth Â£130 a year for a typical base rate taxpayer. Mr Hammond said the Â£1bn investment in universal credit would protect claimants moving onto the new system and a further pledge of Â£1.7bn a year would save millions of families Â£630 a year. But some MPs said it was not enough to undo cuts already made to the system in previous years. Â£400m to allowschools to ""buy the little extras they need"" A digital services taxaimed at tech giants Help for first-time buyersof shared ownership properties Another freeze in fuel duty A Â£30bn package for England's roads,including repairs to motorways and potholes Â£900m inbusiness rates relief for small businessesand Â£650m to rejuvenate high streets Tighter tax rulesaffecting private sector contractors A tax on plastic packaging which does not contain enough recycled materials - but no disposable plastic cup tax An extra Â£1bn for the Ministry of Defenceto boost cyber capabilities and anti-submarine warfare capacity A further Â£650m of grant funding for English local authorities to spend on social care There was a freeze on beer, cider and spirits duty, effectively saving 2p on a pint of beer, 1p on a pint of cider, and 30p on a bottle of Scotch or gin. Wine duty will not be frozen and a bottle will go up by 8p from 1 February next year, and a packet of 20 cigarettes has gone up by 33p. By BBC Health Editor Hugh Pym Spending on public health in England and doctors and nurse training is set to fall next year according to the fine print of the Budget documents. The chancellor announced real terms funding increases for NHS England which provides front line services. But the rest of the Department of Health day to day budget next year (2019/20) will fall - the Health Foundation think tank says in real terms there will be a reduction of Â£1bn, or 12%. This slice of funding covers prevention initiatives run by Public Health England and local authorities, including smoking cessation and sexual health.  It also includes the budget for Health Education England. The previous chancellor, George Osborne, was criticised for announcing increases for NHS England while at the same time cutting allocations for public health and medical and nurse training. It was the last Budget before the UK's scheduled exit from the EU, and came with the final relationship between the two sides yet to be agreed. There was an extra Â£500m to prepare for what happens if the UK leaves the EU without a deal - a scenario Mr Hammond has said would require a whole new Budget. The chancellor also promised a ""double deal dividend"" if the UK and the EU reached agreement over Brexit, which he said could give him more cash to spend on public services. But he said he had been ""very cautious"" in maintaining fiscal headroom - the gap between what he can borrow and what he is planning to borrow - in case of a ""shock"" to the economy, such as a no-deal Brexit. This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: ""This is a broken promise Budget"" Mr Hammond rejected suggestions his Budget giveaways were meant to pave the way for a general election, telling ITV's Good Morning Britain: ""We've now turned a corner and we are able to give Britain a bit of good news."" Mrs May, speaking at a summit of Northern European leaders in Norway, rejected talk of a snap election, saying: ""No we are not preparing for another general election. That would not be in the national interest."" But shadow chancellor John McDonnell said: ""The tradition of the Tories is to cut taxes before an election and then take all the money back again."" He said an election might well be coming because the government ""think they may well fall apart"" and be ""forced"" into holding one. Corbyn - Budget is full of broken promises And he dismissed Mr Hammond's claim that austerity was ""coming to an end"". He said: ""It is now clear austerity is not over, the cuts to social security will continue and Philip Hammond gave no assurances that departments won't face further cuts."" There was nothing in the speech to ""repair the damage to schools, the police and local councils"" he said, adding that the universal credit cash was less than a third of the welfare cuts still scheduled. The SNP's Westminster leader Ian Blackford said the UK was ""wholly unprepared"" for Brexit, and Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable said the Budget was ""a standstill non-event"". Andy Burnham criticised John McDonnell over tax cuts John McDonnell said Labour would support Mr Hammond's income tax cuts, but make the system fairer if they won power. But former Labour cabinet minister, and now mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham, said on twitter: ""At a loss to understand why we are doing this."" And Tottenham MP and former culture minister David Lammy said: ""We should not be supporting tax cuts that disproportionately help the wealthy. Tory cuts will benefit rich families 14 times more than the poor according to (Resolution Foundation) analysis."" Former work and pensions secretary Yvette Cooper said: ""This is wrong. I cannot support it."" Accordingto the Resolution Foundation,,externalthe richest 10% of households will benefit the most from the changes to income tax personal allowance changes.

"Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has condemned a ""broken promises Budget"" and dismissed the government's claims to be ending austerity. He accused the government of focusing on ""ideological tax cuts"" and called for a pay rise for public sector workers. ""What we heard today were half measures and quick fixes while austerity grinds on,"" he said. The chancellor said Labour lacked the ""discipline"" to manage the economy. At-a-glance summary: Budget key points Hammond: 'Austerity coming to an end' Budget 2018: Live updates Philip Hammond's Budget included a Â£1bn investment to help welfare claimants transfer to new consolidated benefit universal credit - but Mr Corbyn said cuts were still ""hardwired"" into the system. ""The reality is austerity is not over,"" he said, adding that ""chunks of the deficit"" had been moved to NHS and local authority budgets. Philip Hammond did not look impressed by Jeremy Corbyn's response to his Budget He also dismissed a pledge of extra money for social care as a ""drop in the ocean"" and said the government was still not offering enough money for the NHS despite its commitment of an extra Â£20bn over the next five years. Labour has promised to increase spending by Â£50bn - raised by tax rises on high earners - as the first stage of its pledge to ""reverse"" austerity. And Mr Corbyn promised to raise investment ""across the board"". The Labour leader said uncertainty over Brexit was ""making things even worse"", saying some Conservatives ""fantasise"" about a ""race to the bottom"" on rights and regulations once the UK left the EU.

"Suzy Lamplugh was reported missing at 18:45 BST on 28 July 1986 A garage linked to the murder of Suzy Lamplugh, who was last seen alive more than 30 years ago, is set to be dug up. Estate agent Suzy, 25, from London, disappeared in July 1986 and was declared dead, presumed murdered, in 1994. A body has never been found. Police are searching at a house in Sutton Coldfield, Birmingham, once owned by the mother of John Cannan - the prime suspect in Suzy's killing. The Met Police refused to comment on ""speculation surrounding the search"". However, it confirmed it was leading the operation, supported by officers from West Midlands Police. An aerial shot of the search area in Sutton Coldfield Suzy's brother Richard said he hoped her body would be found so the family could say a ""proper goodbye"". ""It has been a long time and we have had our expectations raised before but it would nice if we could finally have some closure,"" he told the Mail Online. Homeowner Phillip Carey, 52, said he bought the house on Shipton Road from John Cannan's mother Sheila 26 years ago and was aware of the back story. ""We knew who she was, we became aware who she was as we went through the relationship, and obviously it was high profile at the time."" He told the BBC police arrived on Monday and were investigating a garage behind the semi-detached home, which he used to store DIY items and an old fridge. The iron structure had been dismantled and police were particularly interested in what was underneath its concrete floor, Mr Carey said. The property is being searched by police The BBC understands work to remove parts of the concrete floor has begun. Mr Carey said he believed there was a ""50-50 chance"" Suzy's remains would be found. ""It's a possibility,"" he said. ""There's always a possibility."" This video can not be played Phillip Carey's home is at the centre of a search for Suzy Lamplugh's body Father-of-two Mr Carey said officers had previously performed searches at the property ""on and off"" from the end of 2003 to the spring of 2004. ""They knew what they were looking for. It was just patio they were looking at as far as I was aware,"" he said. Suzy Lamplugh was declared dead in 1994 One of four children, Suzy was born in Cheltenham but grew up in East Sheen, south London. Described by family and colleagues as a conscientious, outgoing and happy young woman, she worked as a beautician on the QE2 cruise liner before becoming an estate agent. At the time of her disappearance, she had been living in a two-bedroom flat in Putney she had purchased a year earlier. Her parents Diana and Paul, who have both since died, described her as someone who lived life to the full. Speaking in 2016, Suzy's father recalled a conversation where his wife ""was chiding her for doing too much"" and Suzy said: ""Come on mum life is for living"". Suzy's diary showed an entry for an appointment with Mr Kipper at 12:45 BST While Suzy's body has never been found, what is known of her final movements has been well documented. She disappeared on 28 July 1986, after going to meet a client - known only as Mr Kipper - who was never traced. Suzy took her keys and a purse containing Â£15 to the appointment in Fulham, south west London, but left her handbag at her office. According to police, she was wearing a grey skirt, dark jacket and low stiletto heels when she was last seen. Later that day, witnesses reported seeing her arguing with a man outside a property in Shorrolds Road. When she failed to attend another appointment, her manager at Sturgis estate agents reported Suzy missing the same evening. A few hours later, police found her company car outside a property for sale in Stevenage Road, one-and-a-half miles away from her original appointment. The white Ford Fiesta had been left with its doors open and Suzy's purse in the door pocket. The key was missing. Investigations also traced the address given by Mr Kipper - and found no-one of that name. No-one has ever been charged in connection with Suzy's disappearance, but in 2002 police named convicted killer Cannan as the only suspect. John Cannan bore a strong resemblance to an e-fit of Mr Kipper - the man she was seen talking to on the day she went missing Three days before Suzy's disappearance, John Cannan was released from Wormwood Scrubs Prison, where he had been serving a six-year sentence for rape. He bore a strong resemblance to an e-fit of the abductor and, according to reports, was nicknamed Kipper while serving his earlier sentence. Now aged 64, in 1989 he was jailed for life for the abduction and murder of Bristol newlywed Shirley Banks and two further rapes. Cannan was ordered to serve a minimum of 35 years in prison, meaning he would be eligible to be considered for parole from 2024. But the then Lord Chief Justice, Lord Lane, said he would ""probably never be safe to release"". In November 2002, police took the unusual step of naming Cannan as the prime suspect in Suzy's murder. However, no prosecution has ever been brought, with police citing insufficient evidence. Cannan hasalways denied any involvement,external. This video can not be played Jim Dickie led a review of the investigation into Suzy's disappearance Jim Dickie, a former Met Police deputy chief inspector, who led a review of the case in 2000, told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme police were likely acting on new evidence. ""It seems as if the [operation] is going to be quite extensive,"" he said. Mr Dickie said his team spoke to John Cannan's mother during their review but did not carry out an ""extensive search"" of the site. There was ""no evidence"" Cannan had ""secreted Suzy's body there"", he said. However, Mr Dickie said Cannan remained ""firmly in the frame as a suspect"", and was ""never eliminated"". Latest news and updates from the West Midlands He said there was ""no doubt [Cannan] was in Fulham on the day Suzy went missing"". The case was reopened in 2000 after a car police believed might have been used to kidnap Suzy was traced. Two sites in Worcestershire - a former Army barracks and a field outside thevillage of Drakes Broughton-  and a woodland in the Quantock Hills, Somerset, have also been searched. Paul and Diana Lamplugh, pictured in May 2000, campaigned for changes in the law Suzy's mother Diana,who died in 2011, set up the Suzy Lamplugh Trust four months after her daughter disappeared. The workplace safety charity has successfully campaigned for private hire vehicle licensing in London, bringing about the Protection from Harassment Act 1997 which tackled stalking, and setting up the National Stalking Helpline. In 2016, Suzy's father said he had little hope left of finding out what happened to her. The trust saidMr Lamplugh died on 12 June this year,external. He and his wife have both been awarded OBEs for their work. In a statement issued on Tuesday morning, the trust said: ""Today's news reminds us once again of the continuing tragedy of Suzy's story and the importance of employers taking responsibility for the personal safety of their staff.""

"The day we've been waiting for all year has finally come around - thebudget's been announced. Ok - that might be a stretch but the government has outlined what it's going to do with its money for the next few years. Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond stood in Parliament for more than an hour explaining all the changes he's making to the country's finances. Here are some of the most important bits that may affect you. Nope, we can't talk about anything right now without mentioning Brexit. The Chancellor announced that he's keeping an extra Â£500m back in case Brexit goes badly. That means he's got about Â£4.4bn stashed away to pay for any problems the UK has as a result of Brexit. If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, we'll get an emergency budget before the scheduled leave day of 29 March. That's the last time we'll mention Brexit - promise. First, here's how your pay will be affected. The amount of your wage you get tax-free - known as the personal allowance - is going up from Â£11,850 to Â£12,500 a year from April 2019. Philip Hammond says that will mean most people will get around an average of Â£130 more a year in their pay packets. The national living wage (the minimum amount over-24s can earn) is also going up, from Â£7.83 to Â£8.21 an hour. The national minimum wage (for 18 to 24-year-olds) will increase, although the Chancellor didn't announce by exactly how much. Earlier in the year, Prime Minister Theresa May announced an extra Â£20.5bn would go to the NHS in England over the next five years. Now, Philip Hammond has explained where some of that money will go, including Â£2bn towards mental health spending. He's announced a new 24-hour mental health hotline. He's also spoken about more ""mental health ambulances"" - special vehicles used to treat people having a mental health episode. Jeremy Corbyn says the chancellor's promise to spend more on mental health is not enough. He says experts reckon the new money is ""only half of what is needed"". What is universal credit - and what's the problem? Universal credit is a system to merge six major benefits together, including unemployment and housing benefits. But many people have had a difficult time going from benefits to universal credit. Payments have been delayed, which have left some people out of pocket as they make the transitions. To try to smooth this, Philip Hammond has announced an extra Â£1bn for the next five years. Austerity is the series of budget cuts and tax rises made by the government since 2010, which includedcuts to departmentslike transport and local government. The ""era of austerity is finally coming to an end,"" said Philip Hammond in his budget speech. He's announced that government spending will start going back up again. But just saying it doesn't mean that austerity suddenly goes away. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said in response: ""Austerity is not over."" He added: ""This budget won't undo the damage done by eight years of austerity."" A new tax will be introduced on big tech companies, which would include firms like Google and Facebook. The Chancellor says it will come into force in 2020, and will raise about Â£400m a year. But it may never actually come into place, as a group of rich countries - including the UK - is alsoplanninga similar tax. So if that tax comes in, the UK's tax won't be used. Make sense? Jeremy Corbyn says that tax is ""too little, too late"". Follow Newsbeat onInstagram,external,Facebook,externalandTwitter,external.

"The final Budget before the UK leaves the EU has been delivered by Chancellor Philip Hammond - preparing the country for what he says is a ""new chapter"" for the economy. Lots of measures that will affect the money in your pocket have been announced in the speech which lasted for well over an hour. Here is what it means for you. A total of 31 million people pay income tax in the UK: 18 million men and 13 million women. Some 25.6 million of these taxpayers pay income tax at the basic rate. The amount you can earn each year before this basic rate of income tax is paid - called the personal allowance - stands at Â£11,850 at the moment. In April, a year earlier than expected, this will change so the first Â£12,500 of earnings will be free from income tax. The higher rate of tax, which starts to be paid at Â£46,350 at the moment, will start at Â£50,000 in April, also 12 months earlier than was originally pledged. This will be a boost to the take-home pay of millions of people. Accountants Deloitte said this would mean an annual tax saving of Â£130 for basic rate taxpayers, Â£860 for higher rate taxpayers and Â£600 for additional rate taxpayers. However, changes to National Insurance could reduce those gains for higher rate taxpayers to around Â£500. This will cost the Treasury Â£2.8bn in the next financial year. These levels will be frozen the following year, but significantly will rise in line with inflation thereafter. That means, as people earn more, they will not automatically be dragged into a higher tax band. The wayincome tax is levied is different in Scotland, owing to its devolved powers. At the moment. the starter rate also begins when annual earnings reach Â£11,850, but this will have to rise to Â£12,500 next year. The higher rate currently starts at Â£43,430 and will be set in Scotland. Any changes will be announced in the Scottish Budget in December. Yes, there has been quite a debate within the Conservative Party about how this is being introduced. Universal Credit is a single monthly payment for people on a low income or who are out of work. It replaces some of the benefits and tax credits that are seen today, such as housing benefit and Jobseeker's Allowance. This is a hugely complex welfare reform, potentiallyaffecting millions of people in different waysin the future - with winners and losers. Various transition measures will be introduced over the next five years, but no details have been released as yet. However, the chancellor said that work allowances would be increased when the roll out of Universal Credit is complete. The allowance is the amount somebody can earn before their benefit payment is affected. In the July 2015 Budget, George Osborne cut the work allowances in Universal Credit. Many working-age benefits are three years through a four-year freeze by April, and this is unchanged. These include Jobseeker's Allowance, Employment and Support Allowance, some types of Housing Benefit, and Child Benefit. Full coverage: Budget 2018 explained At-a-glance summary Budget calculator Kamal Ahmed: Big spender Hammond The level of the National Living Wage, currently Â£7.83 an hour, will increase at a faster rate than the rising cost of living. So the National Living Wage, which is for workers aged 25 and over, will rise to Â£8.21 an hour in April. Prime Minister Theresa May had already announced that fuel duty would be frozen for the ninth year in a row. As announced during the weekend, local councils in England will receive an extra Â£420m to tackle a growing number of potholes. Campaigners say this is not enough to solve the problem. As at the last Budget, the duty on beer, cider, and spirits has been frozen, although there will be an increase on some high-strength drinks, including some white ciders. Wine duty will rise in line with inflation. Tobacco duty will continue to rise by inflation plus 2%. In a move welcomed by many debt charities, the government is extending thebreathing spacefrom legal action given to those facing repayment difficulties, from six weeks to 60 days. A no-interest loan scheme for the financially stretched to overcome vital and unexpected household costs will also be investigated, similar tothe Good Shepherd project,externalseen in Australia. A study will take place next year, working out how a pilot scheme might work. So, it could be sometime before this became a mainstream option. The Treasury believes a third of people claiming self-employed status as a ""personal service company"" are actually working in the same way as employees and should pay more income tax and national insurance. Having changed the rules on this in the public sector, it will now do the same in the private sector from April 2020. However, this will only be used for those working for large and medium-sized businesses. Campaigners immediately described it as a ""fresh raid"" on the self-employed. First-time buyers in England who buy a shared ownership home will get the same stamp duty breaks for homes of up to Â£500,000 as other first-time buyers whoreceived the concession in the last Budget. This will also be backdated for anyone who has bought such a property in the last year. There are more than 200,000 shared ownership properties in the UK. A commemorative 50p coin will be issued to mark the UK's departure from the EU. The coin will feature the Queen's head and the date 29 March 2019 and on the reverse the phrase ""Friendship with all nations"". This is a bit of a turnaround from the last Budget, when the Treasury paved the way for the withdrawal of 1p and 2p coins, and possibly the Â£50 note. This idea has since been dropped. The gradual process allowing people to pass on property to their descendants free from some inheritance tax will enter its third year. It will reach its target by 2021 Many buy-to-let landlords are seeing the amount of tax relief that they can claim on mortgage interest payments cut over the course of four years. The process began in April 2017. Eventually, they will only be able to claim at the lower rate of tax, not the higher Some changes to the way higher redundancy payments, company cars, and employee loans are taxed will also take effect in April.

"The ingredients for chocolate - cocoa powder and cocoa butter - are prepared from cocoa seeds Chocolate has been a delicacy for much longer than previously thought. Botanical evidence shows the plant from which chocolate is made was first grown for food more than 5,000 years ago in the Amazon rainforest. Chemical residues found on ancient pottery suggest cocoa was used as a food, drink or medicine by indigenous people living in what is now Ecuador. Until now it was thought that chocolate originated much later and in Central rather than South America. ""The plant was first used at least 1,500 years earlier than we had previous evidence for,"" said Prof Michael Blake of the department of Anthropology at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, a co-researcher on the study. ""And that previous evidence was found in Mexico and Central America."" The cocoa tree is the source of chocolate Grows naturally in humid, tropical forests and is native to Mexico, Central America and northern South America The fruit - the cocoa pod - contains seeds surrounded by a white pulp. When the seeds are dried in the sun they turn a brownish colour and are known as cocoa beans The ingredients for chocolate - cocoa powder and cocoa butter - are prepared from fermented and roasted cocoa seeds Cocoa products are also used widely in pharmaceutical preparations and skin-care products In 2008-2009 world cocoa production was 3,515,000 tonnes. Source:Theobroma cacao L. - Plants of the World Online - Kew Science,external. Researchers analysed pottery vessels from the Santa Ana (La Florida) archaeological site in the highlands of Ecuador, which was occupied between 5,300 and 2,100 years ago. A number of crops have been documented there, including corn, sweet potatoes and the cacao treeTheobroma cacao. Traces of chemicals and DNA from the plant were found on pottery, suggesting the ground seeds of the cocoa pod were being mixed into a concoction and drunk. Co-researcher, Dr Sonia Zarrillo of the University of Calgary said grains of starch on the pot appeared to be ""unique"" to the cacao tree. The study corroborates DNA data pointing to the tree's origin in the upper Amazon region of northwest South America, which is where the domestic crop also originated. ""It's another gift of the people of Amazonia to the world,"" said Prof Blake. ""It highlights the importance of protecting this habitat."" A bottle that tested positive for the plant It is thought that seedlings or seeds of the cocoa tree were carried north into Mexico and Central America, perhaps along sea routes. Cocoa beans became precious commodities, used as food and drink by the wealthy, or traded for other foods. Spanish explorers in the 1520s took the cocoa beans home and spread the delicacy throughout Europe. The research is published in the journalNature Ecology & Evolution,external.
