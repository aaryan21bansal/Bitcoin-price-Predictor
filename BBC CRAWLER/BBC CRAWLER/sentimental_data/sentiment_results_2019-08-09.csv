"Two CalMac ferries have been at the centre of a long-running dispute The firm behind the Ferguson shipyard in Port Glasgow has begun the process of going into administration. Ferguson Marine Engineering directors have served notice of their intent to go into administration and to do so by the end of next week. The business has been involved in a long-running dispute with the Scottish government over the construction of two ferries for CalMac. Ministers said they were committed to securing the future of the yard. They want to see the vessels under construction completed, and the jobs of the yard's 350 staff safeguarded. Ferguson Marine's chief executive Gerry Marshall said in a statement: ""It is with great regret and disappointment that the directors of Ferguson Marine Engineering Limited have served notice to appoint an administrator to the company. ""This decision has not been taken lightly, but the directors do not consider there to be any other options in the current circumstances. ""However, the directors will continue to support the shareholder and the Scottish government to realise a positive outcome for the business and its employees."" The Glen Sannox has been awaiting completion at the yard since its launch The ferry order which appears to have triggered the shipbuilder's difficulties is being procured through a public-sector agency CMAL. The yard's parent company, Clyde Blowers Capital (CBC), is controlled by industrial tycoon Jim McColl. CBC tabled a proposal last month for the Scottish government to take a share of ownership. The governmentrejected that plan. In a statement, CBC added: ""We understand that this decision has not been taken lightly and is fundamentally due to CMAL and the Scottish government's inability to find a resolution to the additional costs encountered during the build of the two prototype LNG dual-fuelled ferries. ""As shareholder we have provided a number of viable proposals to avoid the process of administration and save the jobs of 350 employees, however CMAL and the Scottish government have consistently refused to participate in productive discussions, leaving the directors of Ferguson Marine Engineering Limited with no other options given the circumstances they are faced with."" Launching into uncharted waters Like a ship at its launch, gathering momentum as it descends the slipway, there's not much that can stop Ferguson Marine Engineering Ltd from plunging into the uncertain waters of government ownership. Happily, it is unlike yards on the narrower upper Clyde in that launches do not carry the risk of getting a severe dunt on the opposite bank. But there's a lot about these waters that is uncharted.

The lifeline ferry deal that went adrift Shipshape: when the state steps in Who pays the ferryman? Stage set for legal battle There have been suggestions the government could use a clause in the Â£45m of loan agreements between it and Ferguson Marine Engineering Limited (FMEL), through which it could take over the yard for only Â£1. The two ships being built for CalMac, the Scottish government-owned ferry company, have caused particular difficulties because of their innovative hybrid power systems, using diesel and liquefied natural gas. Following the news of possible administration for the business, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the government was determined to protect jobs and secure the future of the yard.

A Scottish government spokeswoman added: ""Our priority remains to ensure the completion of the vessels under construction, secure jobs for the workforce and protect the future of shipbuilding at the site. ""We have been working to secure a future for the shipyard for two years, and it is disappointing that we have not been able to reach a commercial solution with CBC that would have prevented administrators becoming involved. ""We appreciate that this will be a concerning time for the workforce, their families and the local community, and we would like to reassure them that we are committed to maintaining the jobs on the site and building a secure future for the yard and its workforce.

"Mohamed Salah (second left) has found the net in all five of his Premier League appearances on a Friday, scoring six goals times Liverpool scored four first-half goals as they started the new Premier League season with a blistering performance to demolish newly-promoted Norwich City at Anfield. Norwich captain Grant Hanley scored the opening goal of the top-flight season when he sliced Divock Origi's cross into his own net before Mohamed Salah opened his account after a pass by Roberto Firmino. German midfielder Marco Stipermann forced a fine save by Reds keeper Alisson before an unmarked Virgil van Dijk headed the third from Salah's corner, Origi nodding the fourth after a stunning pass by Trent Alexander-Arnold. Teemu Pukki's composed finish reduced the deficit after Liverpool lost Alisson to injury, the Brazil keeper replaced by new signing Adrian after slipping while taking a first-half goal-kick. âA disjointed pre-season and a lack of signings â but Liverpool make ideal startâ Reaction from Anfield Can Liverpool break their second-place 'curse'? There was a carnival atmosphere at Anfield for Liverpool's first home game since beating Tottenham in the Champions League final on 1 June and Jurgen Klopp's side responded with a superb display. They might have won by a more handsome margin as Tim Krul palmed Origi's attempt onto the bar after making a brilliant save to keep out Firmino's ferocious volley. Krul also did well to keep out Alexander-Arnold's late free-kick. Divock Origi (right) has now scored on every day of the week for Liverpool Any fears Liverpool might be suffering a hangover after missing out to Manchester City by one point in the race for last season's title were quickly dispelled as the Reds started their quest to win a first top-flight title in 30 years in style. Supporters were looking for evidence Klopp's team can go one step better than last season and, while bigger tests lie ahead, a thumping win against a team fresh out of the Championship is a decent start. After a quiet summer in the transfer market, it was the same familiar faces on show including nine players who started the win over Spurs in Madrid in June. Origi, who came off the bench to score in the Champions League final win, helped his side take the lead with a cross which ended in the back of the net after Hanley's misfortune. Salah doubled the lead with a trademark low angled finish after Firmino's assist before Salah turned provider with the corner for Van Dijk to make it 3-0. Liverpool were coasting and even after losing Alisson to injury they increased their advantage after Alexander-Arnold's sublime pass allowed Origi to head the fourth goal. On a night of positives for the home side, Joe Gomez came through his first league game of 2019 after recovering from a fractured leg. How will the promoted sides fare? Man admits posting racist tweets at Salah This video can not be played Liverpool 4-1 Norwich: Alisson injury 'big shadow' over win - Jurgen Klopp Klopp said he was worried about the injury suffered by Alisson, who was a key figure in Liverpool's eye-catching 2018-19 season. After slipping in front of the Kop, the Brazilian received treatment on the pitch before a stretcher was brought on. Alisson eventually managed to get back to his feet and leave the field with help from a physio, but any prolonged absence would be a blow for Liverpool. ""With Alisson it is not good, but we will find a solution and move on,"" Klopp told BBC Sport's Match of the Day. ""He felt his calf. He looked behind him because he thought something hit him."" The German added that the Brazilian would not feature in Wednesday's Uefa Super Cup match against Chelsea. Former West Ham keeper Adrian, brought in to replace the departed Simon Mignolet earlier in the week, made one fine save from Moritz Leitner before being beaten by Pukki. This video can not be played Liverpool 4-1 Norwich: Daniel Farke 'totally in love' with Norwich team despite defeat This was Norwich's first Premier League game since losing 3-0 at Liverpool's neighbours Everton in May 2016, having already been relegated. They fared no better on their return to Merseyside. In truth, next week's home game with Newcastle will provide a better gauge of how the Canaries will fare this season. Despite the scoreline, Norwich caused Liverpool's defence problems and Pukki's lovely finish after Emiliano Buendia's pass at least provoked some gallows humour from Norwich's travelling fans. ""One-nil in the second half,"" was the defiant song that rang out. Norwich have been busy in the transfer market and although none of their new recruits started at Anfield, expect that to change when they return to Carrow Road next week. Mohamed Salah had a fine performance but Origi just about edged it as he marked his start ahead of Sadio Mane with a goal and an assist Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp told Match of the Day:""For 60 minutes we looked very sharp, then we have to control the game a bit more. Norwich have all my respect - they stayed cheeky, they enjoyed their football. ""At the start of the second half we could have scored a fifth or sixth goal, then Norwich scored. After that we were never in danger but had to work hard to keep the score what it was. ""The players had a break (over the summer). For the body it was long enough, nobody asked for longer, so they didn't lose a lot of their physical standards. We have to be a bit smart for the next two games, we have to make a few decisions and try to win both of those games, which will be difficult."" Norwich boss Daniel Farke speaking to Match of the Day:""We're disappointed. We were greedy, we wanted to be the first team in two-and-a-half years to win here. ""But I'm totally in love with this team. The mentality to win the second half in front of an excited home crowd, we showed great character. ""No-one wanted to hear it at half-time, but I told them we had the same possession and had created more chances. Liverpool had scored four though. ""It was tough to take but I felt we were not too far away from a good result."" Liverpool have scored 15 goals in their four opening day Premier League matches under manager JÃ¼rgen Klopp (W3 D1 L0), netting four times in their first match of the league season in consecutive seasons for the first time in their entire history. Norwich have won their first match of the league season in just one of the past 17 seasons (W1 D8 L8). Liverpool are unbeaten in their past 13 Premier League games against Norwich (W11 D2 L0), scoring 43 goals across those games, including at least four goals in five of their last seven meetings. Salah has scored in Liverpool's first Premier League match in each of the last three seasons (2017-18, 2018-19 and 2019-20). The first goal of the Premier League season was an own-goal for only the second time - the other occasion was in 2015-16, when Kyle Walker's own-goal was the only goal in Manchester United's 1-0 win over Spurs. Pukki has scored with his first shot on target in each of the last eight league seasons (across Schalke 04, Celtic, Brondby IF and Norwich careers); a record stretching back to the start of 2012-13. Liverpool scored three goals in the opening half-hour of a Premier League game for the first time since February 2014, when they were 4-0 up after 20 minutes against Arsenal. Liverpool defender Alexander-Arnold became the first player to register an assist in five consecutive Premier League appearances since Arsenal's Mesut Ozil in 2015, and is one of only eight players in Premier League history to do so. Norwich's Onel Hernandez became the first Cuban player in the Premier League, with Cuba the 114th different nationality represented in Premier League history. Liverpool are off to Istanbul to face Chelsea in the Uefa Super Cup on Wednesday (20:00 BST) while Norwich have a full week to prepare for the visit of Newcastle United to Carrow Road on 17 August (15:00).

"The Cathay chairman said he ""wouldn't dream"" of telling his staff what to think China's aviation regulator has ordered the Hong Kong-based airline Cathay Pacific to suspend any staff who support pro-democracy protests in the territory. Beijing's demand coincided with a peaceful rally at Hong Kong's airport, where thousands occupied a terminal. Cathay also faced pressure online after China's state-run press fuelled a #BoycottCathayPacific hashtag, which trended on Chinese social media. Hong Kong has seen weeks of protests over China's control of the territory. The protests began about nine weeks ago over a proposed extradition bill between Hong Kong and mainland China and evolved into demands for greater freedoms. Hong Kong is part of China but its citizens have more autonomy than those on the mainland. It has a free press and judicial independence under the so-called ""one country, two systems"" approach - freedoms activists fear are being increasingly eroded. Earlier this week China warned the pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong not to ""underestimate the firm resolve of the central government"". This week China appeared to turn its attention to companies it sees as connected to the protests. Cathay was targeted after one of its pilots was arrested among protesters, and the airline's flight attendants union signed a joint statement with other aviation industry employees backing the protesters. ""The four sins of Cathay Pacific Airlines,"" read a headline in Chinese state newspaper the People's Daily, which detailed actions by the carrier it said were supportive of the pro-democracy movement. This video can not be played Why did protesters take to the streets in Hong Kong? Cathay chairman John Slosar defended his staff. ""We employ 27,000 staff in Hong Kong doing all sorts of different jobs... we certainly wouldn't dream of telling them what they have to think about something,"" he said. A Taiwanese bubble tea franchise - Yifang - and a popular Japanese sports drink were also targeted by boycott campaigns. One of Yifang's branches in Hong Kong had reportedly hung a sign cheering on the protesters. The branch was later vandalised, Taiwanese broadcaster TVBS reported. How weeks of protests have hit Hong Kong tourism Protesters turn to Uber and Pokemon The background you need on the protests Japanese sports drink Pocari Sweat pulled advertising from Hong Kong television station TVB, which protesters accuse of pro-Beijing coverage. Under pressure of a boycott, the firm's mainland China office issued a statement saying it operated separately from the Hong Kong division and upheld China's ""one country, two systems"" rule. The boycotts came as protesters gathered at Hong Kong airport for three days of peaceful demonstrations. Activists waved banners written in different languages denouncing Carrie Lam, Hong Kong's chief executive, and the police, and handed out leaflets with artwork explaining the recent protests.

Authorities are so far tolerating the rally, which have not overly disrupted passengers. There are as yet no police at the scene. ""It will be a peaceful protest as long as the police do not show up,"" one demonstrator told Reuters news agency. Fake boarding passes saying ""HK to freedom"" appeared on social media,externalto promote the rally.Hong Kong's Airport Authority said it would ""operate normally"",externaldespite the planned demonstrations. A protest at the airport on 26 July with thousands of Hong Kongers - including flight staff - took place without violence. Ms Lam met business leaders on Friday to discuss the economic impact of the protests. ""We've experienced Sars and financial crises,"" she told reporters after the meeting, referring to the respiratory disease epidemic in 2003. ""This time is more serious."" Property developers in the territory had earlier warned that demonstrations were damaging Hong Kong's economy. Ms Lam spoke to reporters after a meeting with business leaders Ms Lam also announced the government would reconvene a week earlier than planned from recess on 13 August. But she refused to offer concessions to protesters, accusing a ""small minority of people"" of wanting to destroy the economy and of having ""no stake in the society which so many people have helped to build"". ""If you are unsatisfied with the Hong Kong government that does not mean you should condone the violence. We hope to do our work better,"" she said. Young and unhappy in Hong Kong Beijing's struggle to win Hong Kong's young hearts Earlier on Friday, authorities confirmed that former deputy police commissioner Alan Lau has been brought out of retirement to help handle protests in the territory. The commander previously oversaw Hong Kong's pro-democracy rallies in 2014. Beijing has issued increasingly stern warnings about the continuing demonstrations, and the military recently released a video showing them conducting anti-riot drills. The US on Friday called China a ""thuggish regime"" after a Chinese state newspaper published the name and photo of a US diplomat talking to Hong Kong activists. China dismissed the remark as ""gangster logic"". The Chinese have repeatedly accused the US of interfering in the situation in Hong Kong.

"The TUC said construction jobs were among the middle-income roles which were squeezed Pay rates have effectively fallen for the UK's lower and middle income earners since 2010, research suggests. Workers in jobs paying between Â£9.56 and Â£12.73 an hour have seen their ""real"" wage drop 1% since 2010 after inflation is accounted for, analysis by the Trades Union Congress (TUC) found. However, the lowest-paid workers have seen average real pay rates increase 5%, thanks to minimum wage rises. Ministers say all workers saw income tax cuts and real pay was now rising. Real wage rates adjust the hourly rate for the effect of inflation, the average increase in the cost of goods and services, which erode the spending power of your money. The TUC says lower and middle income earners may have seen their spending money squeezed The pay rate analysis identifies middle income earners, those earning near the median wage rate of Â£12.73 per hour, as having their earning power eroded since 2010. This 1% reduction in pay rates compares to a rise of 7% for this group of 7.7 million workers between 2002 and 2010, the TUC analysis argues. For workers earning between the median wage rate of Â£12.73 and Â£25.45 per hour, pay rates have on average fallen 3% in the period. The TUC analysis shows the 1.1 million highest income earners, banking above Â£25.45 per hour worked, saw average pay rates rise 4% since 2010. Kate Bell from the TUC says median wages still are not where they were before the financial crisis ""so a little bit of pay pick-up in the last couple of months... doesn't mean we're out of the woods yet"". Ms Bell added: ""People in middle earning jobs have seen their pay fall. Jobs like those in construction, the local government in administrative jobs for example you've likely seen your pay go down over this period. That has an impact on your ability to live and ability to pay your bills"". The most recentOffice for National Statistics data on employmentand earnings for the year to 31 May showed a record 32.75 million people in work and average wage growth for the year at 3.8%, the highest since the financial crisis in 2008. ONS data showed wage growth has been outpacing the inflation rate since March 2018, meaning the spending power of salaries is not being eroded by price rises in shops. The head of the Recruitment and Employment Confederation, Neil Carberry, said businesses have faced increased costs since 2010 such as the apprenticeship levy and pension auto-enrolment. Mr Carberry said boosting the UK's lagging workplace productivity was key to improving wages and salaries for employees. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said: ""It's staggering that millions of people have faced cuts to their real pay since 2010 while the highest earners have had their pay skyrocket."" He said a Labour government would introduce areal living wage,externalof at least Â£10 an hour and give trade unions more power to end the ""scandal"" of low pay. A Treasury spokesman said: ""Real wages are now rising on a sustainable basis for the first time in a decade. ""We have given the lowest paid a pay rise of almost 5% by increasing theNational Living Wage,external, cut income tax for 32 million people and taken 1.74 million people out of income tax. ""We are also helping with the cost of living by freezing fuel duty and doubling free child care for working parents of three and four year olds."" Conservative deputy chairman Paul Scully added: ""The facts are that under the Conservatives, the unemployment rate - and the proportion of low paid workers - have both fallen to a record low, and our National Living Wage is delivering pay rises for millions of people across the country"".

"This video can not be played Brexit has created ""cloudy skies"", says Zed Sheikh The chancellor has told the BBC that he does not expect the UK to slide into recession after data showed the economy shrank by 0.2% between April and June. Sajid Javid was speaking after the Office for National Statistics said the economy had contracted for the first time since 2012. The surprise decline came after Brexit stockpiles were unwound and the car industry implemented shutdowns. The pound sank after the data was released, raising fears of a recession. Against the dollar sterling fell to $1.2025. Against the euro, it dropped throughout the day to â¬1.0736, a level not seen since the global financial crisis a decade ago. Rob Kent-Smith, head of GDP at the ONS, said manufacturing output fell and the construction sector weakened. What is the UK's GDP? Bank of England cuts UK growth forecast A recession occurs when the economy contracts in two consecutive quarters. This is the first contraction since the fourth quarter of 2012. Economists had not been forecasting a contraction in the economy in the second quarter, but had expected it to stagnate, with the consensus forecast for 0% growth. The economyhad shown 0.5% growth in the first quarterafter manufacturers' stockpiling ahead of Brexit helped to boost output, when the manufacturing sector recorded its biggest quarter rise since the 1980s. The ONS said GDP had been ""particularly volatile"" so far this year because of the changes to activity sparked by the original Brexit date of 29 March. The statistics body said its latest figures showed that those increased stockpiles had been partly run down in the second quarter and that a number of car manufacturers had brought forward their annual shutdowns to April as part of contingency planning, which also hit growth. Mr Kent-Smith said: ""Manufacturing output fell back after a strong start to the year, with production brought forward ahead of the UK's original departure date from the EU."" He added that ""the often-dominant service sector delivered virtually no growth at all"". Mr Javid told the BBC: ""I am not expecting a recession at all. And in fact, don't take my word for it. There's not a single leading forecaster out there that is expecting a recession, the independent Bank of England is not expecting a recession. And that's because they know that the fundamentals remain strong."" The Bank said earlier this monthit expects the economy to grow by 1.3% this year, down from a previous projection of 1.5% in May. This video can not be played The Chancellor Sajid Javid said he was not expecting a recession Asked about the impact of Brexit, he said: ""We saw some significant stockpiling by British businesses in anticipation of the Brexit that never was, and now they're using those stockpiles, they're coming down. ""Of course, there are businesses out there that are taking Brexit into account when they're making decisions."" He said: ""No one will be surprised by today's figures."" The data comes at a time when there are signs other economies are slowing. For instance, data on Friday showed that French industrial output fell more than expected in June. Mr Javid said: ""This is a challenging period across the global economy, with growth slowing in many countries. ""But the fundamentals of the British economy are strong - wages are growing, employment is at a record high and we're forecast to grow faster than Germany, Italy and Japan this year."" But John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said the ""dismal economic figures are a direct result of Tory incompetence"". ""The Tories' Brexit bungling, including Boris Johnson now taking us towards no-deal, is breaking the economy."" The Liberal Democrats were also concerned about the impact of a no-deal Brexit. ""Pursuing a no-deal Brexit is a political choice without a mandate: these figures show people's jobs and livelihoods are being sacrificed at the altar of political extremism, "" said Chuka Umunna, the party's Treasury and business spokesperson. Mr Javid said the best way to deal with Brexit uncertainty was to leave the EU on 31 October, with or without a deal. ""We're seeing volatility in the figures and one of the best ways to actually end this volatility is to bring certainty around Brexit and make sure we leave on 31 October."" The employers' body, the CBI, said the contraction was ""concerning"". Alpesh Paleja, CBI lead economist, said: ""Growth has been pushed down by an unwind of stockpiling and car manufacturers shifting their seasonal shutdowns. The winding down of Brexit stockpiling was partly to blame for the weak growth ""Nonetheless, it's clear from our business surveys that underlying momentum remains lukewarm, choked by a combination of slower global growth and Brexit uncertainty. ""As a result, business sentiment is dire."" The Federation of Small Businesses - which is calling for an emergency Budget - said that if the Treasury delays action until after 31 October, the date for Brexit, its efforts are likely to prove too little, too late. ""Time is of the essence. Unless the chancellor steps in imminently with radical action, we could be heading for a chaotic autumn - and a very long winter,"" said the FSB's policy and advocacy chairman, Martin McTague. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, said the data showed ""an economy in decline and skirting with recession  as headwinds from slower global growth are exacerbated by a Brexit-related paralysis"". Geoffrey Yu of UBS Wealth Management said that while the global picture was ""becoming more gloomy"", anyone looking for positive signs for the economy could look to ""robust private consumption, reflecting a healthy labour market"". Household spending rose 0.5% on the quarter. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, agreed that household spending was still growing at a ""robust rate"" and said it was not time to panic. He said the stockpiling was dragging on the economy, which was ""sluggish and had not stalled"". The pound - which has been at two-year lows following Brexit uncertainty - fell after the data was released. The currency also falls if there are expectations that interest rates will be cut. Mr Tombs said the market now sees a 70% chance of an interest rate cut in January, when Mark Carney is due to leave as the Bank of England's governor. How fast is the UK's economy growing?

"Chris Chadwick-Parnell had his money stolen in Bangor High Street A man found guilty of stealing from a blind busker was slammed for carrying out ""a despicable act on a vulnerable person"" by a magistrate. Gary Williams stole money from Chris Chadwick-Parnell in Bangor High Street. The 51-year-old, of Love Lane, Bangor, had denied theft but was found guilty by Caernarfon magistrates. Alan Fothergill, 43, of Plas Mabon, Bangor, admitted theft. Both men will be sentenced at later dates. Williams had claimed he had been trying to help the busker on 26 June. But magistrate Peter Talbot praised a ""public-spirited passer-by"" who filmed what was happening because they were concerned. Chris Chadwick-Parnell said he didn't ""feel safe working outside"" after the theft In a victim impact statement, Mr Chadwick-Parnell described how music helped him and the financial impact of not being able to busk. ""I don't feel safe to work outside any more,"" he said. Williams pleaded guilty to a public orderÂ offence, having sworn at a police officer when arrested and having arrived late to court. He was told to pay Â£110 in a fine and costs for these offences. Magistrates sent the case to crown court, saying their sentencing powers for the theft were ""insufficient"".

"This video can not be played A full-size helter-skelter has been constructed inside Norwich Cathedral The clergy at a cathedral has been accused of being unprofessional and ""poisoning the medicine"" a church offers by installing a fairground ride. A full-size helter-skelter has been put in the nave of Norwich Cathedral to give people a different view of the inside of the building. The Right Reverend Dr Gavin Ashenden, former chaplain to the Queen, said the cathedral had made a ""mistake"". The cathedral said it was a creative way to share the story of the Bible. The Very Reverend Jane Hedges takes a ride on the helter-skelter It took four people two days to build the 55ft (16.7m) fairground ride in the Norman cathedral. The cathedral said it allowed people to stand close to its medieval roof bosses, believed to be the largest display of its kind in the world. Dr Ashenden, Missionary Bishop for the Christian Episcopal Church, said the clergy at Norwich Cathedral had been ""unprofessional"" and were ""making a mistake about what a cathedral is good for"". He said there was no evidence that tourists become Christians and ""just to put in entertainment is naff"". ""For such a place, steeped in mystery and marvel to buy in to sensory pleasure and distraction, is to poison the very medicine it offers the human soul,"" he said. The Right Reverend Dr Gavin Ashenden said the helter-skelter was a ""mistake"" The helter-skelter has been installed in the nave of Norwich Cathedral The Reverend Canon Andy Bryant, from Norwich Cathedral, said he could see why people would be surprised to see the helter-skelter. But in addition to showcasing the roof, he said it was ""part of the cathedral's mission to share the story of the Bible"" and was a ""creative and innovative way to do that"". Norwich Cathedral is not the only place of worship to use unconventional methods to attract members of the public. The central aisle of Rochester Cathedral has also beenconverted into a crazy golf course.

"The Cathay chairman said he ""wouldn't dream"" of telling his staff what to think China's aviation regulator has ordered the Hong Kong-based airline Cathay Pacific to suspend any staff who support pro-democracy protests in the territory. Beijing's demand coincided with a peaceful rally at Hong Kong's airport, where thousands occupied a terminal. Cathay also faced pressure online after China's state-run press fuelled a #BoycottCathayPacific hashtag, which trended on Chinese social media. Hong Kong has seen weeks of protests over China's control of the territory. The protests began about nine weeks ago over a proposed extradition bill between Hong Kong and mainland China and evolved into demands for greater freedoms. Hong Kong is part of China but its citizens have more autonomy than those on the mainland. It has a free press and judicial independence under the so-called ""one country, two systems"" approach - freedoms activists fear are being increasingly eroded. Earlier this week China warned the pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong not to ""underestimate the firm resolve of the central government"". This week China appeared to turn its attention to companies it sees as connected to the protests. Cathay was targeted after one of its pilots was arrested among protesters, and the airline's flight attendants union signed a joint statement with other aviation industry employees backing the protesters. ""The four sins of Cathay Pacific Airlines,"" read a headline in Chinese state newspaper the People's Daily, which detailed actions by the carrier it said were supportive of the pro-democracy movement. This video can not be played Why did protesters take to the streets in Hong Kong? Cathay chairman John Slosar defended his staff. ""We employ 27,000 staff in Hong Kong doing all sorts of different jobs... we certainly wouldn't dream of telling them what they have to think about something,"" he said. A Taiwanese bubble tea franchise - Yifang - and a popular Japanese sports drink were also targeted by boycott campaigns. One of Yifang's branches in Hong Kong had reportedly hung a sign cheering on the protesters. The branch was later vandalised, Taiwanese broadcaster TVBS reported. How weeks of protests have hit Hong Kong tourism Protesters turn to Uber and Pokemon The background you need on the protests Japanese sports drink Pocari Sweat pulled advertising from Hong Kong television station TVB, which protesters accuse of pro-Beijing coverage. Under pressure of a boycott, the firm's mainland China office issued a statement saying it operated separately from the Hong Kong division and upheld China's ""one country, two systems"" rule. The boycotts came as protesters gathered at Hong Kong airport for three days of peaceful demonstrations. Activists waved banners written in different languages denouncing Carrie Lam, Hong Kong's chief executive, and the police, and handed out leaflets with artwork explaining the recent protests.

Authorities are so far tolerating the rally, which have not overly disrupted passengers. There are as yet no police at the scene. ""It will be a peaceful protest as long as the police do not show up,"" one demonstrator told Reuters news agency. Fake boarding passes saying ""HK to freedom"" appeared on social media,externalto promote the rally.Hong Kong's Airport Authority said it would ""operate normally"",externaldespite the planned demonstrations. A protest at the airport on 26 July with thousands of Hong Kongers - including flight staff - took place without violence. Ms Lam met business leaders on Friday to discuss the economic impact of the protests. ""We've experienced Sars and financial crises,"" she told reporters after the meeting, referring to the respiratory disease epidemic in 2003. ""This time is more serious."" Property developers in the territory had earlier warned that demonstrations were damaging Hong Kong's economy. Ms Lam spoke to reporters after a meeting with business leaders Ms Lam also announced the government would reconvene a week earlier than planned from recess on 13 August. But she refused to offer concessions to protesters, accusing a ""small minority of people"" of wanting to destroy the economy and of having ""no stake in the society which so many people have helped to build"". ""If you are unsatisfied with the Hong Kong government that does not mean you should condone the violence. We hope to do our work better,"" she said. Young and unhappy in Hong Kong Beijing's struggle to win Hong Kong's young hearts Earlier on Friday, authorities confirmed that former deputy police commissioner Alan Lau has been brought out of retirement to help handle protests in the territory. The commander previously oversaw Hong Kong's pro-democracy rallies in 2014. Beijing has issued increasingly stern warnings about the continuing demonstrations, and the military recently released a video showing them conducting anti-riot drills. The US on Friday called China a ""thuggish regime"" after a Chinese state newspaper published the name and photo of a US diplomat talking to Hong Kong activists. China dismissed the remark as ""gangster logic"". The Chinese have repeatedly accused the US of interfering in the situation in Hong Kong.

"Benjamin Field (right) has been convicted of the murder of Peter Farquhar A churchwarden has been found guilty of murdering an author after tricking him into changing his will. Benjamin Field, 28, manipulated 69-year-old Peter Farquhar for financial gain and tried to make his death look like an accident or suicide. Field was also accused of plotting to kill Mr Farquhar's neighbour Ann Moore-Martin, 83, in the village of Maids Moreton but was found not guilty. He was remanded in custody and will be sentenced at a date to be fixed. At Oxford Crown Court, Field was also acquitted of the attempted murder of Miss Moore-Martin. Mr Farquhar died in the Buckinghamshire village in October 2015, while Miss Moore-Martin, who lived three doors away, died in May 2017 from natural causes. The killer who believed he would 'get away with it' Field, a Baptist minister's son, admitted duping both Mr Farquhar and Miss Moore-Martin into fake relationships with him as part of a plot to get them to change their wills, but denied any involvement in their deaths. The court heard Field had undergone a ""betrothal"" ceremony with Mr Farquhar and was in a sexual relationship with Miss Moore-Martin. Prosecutor Oliver Saxby QC told the trial Field carried out a sustained ""gaslighting"" plot aimed at making Mr Farquhar question his sanity. Mr Farquhar's drinks were topped up with bioethanol and poteen, a high strength Irish alcohol, and his food was laced with drugs, Mr Saxby said. Mr Farquhar, who taught part-time at the University of Buckingham and had three novels published, suffered night terrors and hallucinations which he recorded in a handwritten journal. His third novel A Wide Wide Sea, published in 2015, was dedicated to Field, who delivered the eulogy at his funeral. Field said he drugged Mr Farquhar ""purely out of meanness"" Field's co-accused Martyn Smith, 32, of Penhalvean, Redruth, Cornwall, was cleared of murdering Mr Farquhar, plotting to kill Miss Moore-Martin, fraud and burglary. Speaking afterwards, he said: ""I am relieved that this ordeal is finally over...The lessons I take from this case are first and foremost to always be your own person and secondly to always choose your friends very carefully."" During the trial Field admitted drugging Mr Farquhar with benzodiazepines and hallucinogenic legal highs to ""torment"" him. He told the jury he did it ""for no other reason other than it was cruel, to upset and torment Peter - purely out of meanness"". But prosecutors said Field had a ""profound fascination in controlling and manipulating and humiliating and killing"". After Mr Farquhar changed his will three times in two years to benefit Field, he ""had to die"", Mr Saxby said. The court heard Field ""suffocated him"" when he was too weak to resist, and left a half-empty bottle of whisky in Mr Farquhar's room to create the misconception he had drunk himself to death. In a statement read by police, Mr Farquhar's brother Ian said: ""[Field's] actions have been unbelievably callous, and he has told lie after lie after lie in order to achieve his goals, deceiving everyone he met."" Senior investigating officer Mark Glover described Field as ""cruel, calculating, manipulative, deceitful"", adding: ""I don't think evil is too strong a word for him."" Chris Derrick, from the Crown Prosecution Service, said: ""He is clearly a very calculating and ruthless man who spent a great deal of time planning what he was going to do."" After the verdicts, journalist Michael Crick, who was taught by Mr Farquhar at Manchester Grammar School,tweeted,external: ""It's so dreadful to think my dear friend and teacher Peter Farquhar was murdered in such an awful way by a man he loved and trusted so much."" Another former pupil of the school, David Scheinmann, directed 2013 film Believe and has said a headmaster character, played by Toby Stevens, was in part based on Mr Farquhar. Mr Farquhar would often fall over after being drugged by Field Miss Moore-Martin's niece Ann-Marie Blake paid tribute to her aunt, who she described as ""a kind, gentle, beautiful soul, who touched so many lives, leaving behind a legacy of wonderful memories"". Judge Mr Justice Sweeney said it had been a ""challenging case"" for the jury, which took 77 hours to reach its verdict. He remanded Field, of Wellingborough Road, Olney, in custody until sentencing at a date to be fixed and ordered a psychiatric report. Field previously admitted four charges of fraud and two of burglary. His brother Tom Field, 24, of the same address, was cleared of a single charge of fraud. Murder accused 'drew up list of targets' Murder accused admits 'tormenting' victim Murder accused admits faking relationships Murder accused 'sent love poems to victim' Murder accused 'snaketalked' way into home Murder accused 'was betrothed to victim' Woman, 83, 'hypnotised' by murder accused 'Gaslighting' plot to murder lecturer Murder accused 'killed author for will' HM Courts & Tribunals Service 'Beloved' white lioness sisters retire from Hertfordshire Zoo Cheryl Tweedy stalked by convicted killer at South Bucks home Re-appeal after woman hit by car on A1(M) near Welwyn Garden City M&S: Marks and Spencer warns of potential UK price hikes across food and clothing - as share price drops New Year's resolutions: Apple's 5 top-rated apps for learning a new language in 2025 Liam Payne's medical cause of death confirmed as inquest opened by Bucks coroner Los Angeles mayor giving update on wildfires as more residents told to evacuate What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

"Work on Glen Sannox has fallen way behind schedule Ferguson Marine Engineering looks very likely to become a government-owned shipyard. It raises questions about industrial strategy, if another company is to be run by the state, after repeated failures. What will Scottish ministers do with the shipyard, where industrial tycoon Jim McColl failed? And what opportunities will be lost if his management team is leaving? Like a ship at its launch, gathering momentum as it descends the slipway, there's not much that can stop Ferguson Marine Engineering Ltd from plunging into the uncertain waters of government ownership. Happily, it is unlike yards on the narrower upper Clyde in that launches do not carry the risk of getting a severe dunt on the opposite bank. But there's a lot about these waters that is uncharted. By the end of next week, it seems likely that the financial risk for the shipyard will be on government books, and no longer those of industrialist Jim McColl. The Scottish government's agency, Caledonian Maritime Assets Ltd (CMAL), is understood already to have paid almost all the Â£97m fixed price for the two CalMac ferries at the heart of the Ferguson's dispute, and long before their completion. If the future is to be nationalised, it will have to pay for the remaining work to get the Glen Sannox and 'hull number 802' into service on the Brodick-Ardrossan route and between Lochmaddy, Uig and Tarbert. CMAL has been blamed by Ferguson for making so many changes to the design - particularly of the special requirements for the prototype diesel/liquified natural gas engine - that the cost is now reckoned to have doubled. Jim McColl had offered to meet the Scottish government roughly half way on the overspend - asking for about Â£40m. A statement from his company says it consistently refused to engage. The Scottish government argues, first, that to bail McColl's company out of a fixed price contract would bring legal claims by other bidders, and second, that to fund the overspend would break European state aid rules. Jim McColl had sought a compromise deal with the government So if it wasn't willing to meet some of Ferguson's extra costs: it is determined to finish the ferries and keep the yard open, thus protecting jobs: it has Â£45m in loans outstanding, which have long puzzled opposition MSPs: then state ownership becomes the inevitable consequence. That raises big questions about industrial strategy.  The SNP administration has been willing to take a stake in BiFab fabrication yards, though their prospects for sustainable orders, and building up to scale of offshore wind farm work, do not look good. Having taken over Prestwick Airport, it is subsidising operations there with up to Â£10m per year (while declaring a climate emergency). And it has taken over Scotland's once world-leading wave power firms in the hope that their technology will one day find a market. So is this the state backing new technologies? Or preserving older industries, with the jobs attached, in the belief that state ownership can succeed where Scotland's most successful living engineering entrepreneur could not? Mr McColl will be licking his financial and reputational wounds. It is understood that he sank around Â£28m in Ferguson Marine, having arrived with a huge fanfare in the closing stages of the independence referendum. As one of the economic advisers to the Scottish government, he'll be wondering if he wants to get that close again. The extent of damage to his investment vessel, Clyde Blowers Capital, depends on whether he gets compensation and ""fair value"", or merely the Â£1 for which the yard could potentially be transferred. The plans his management team had worked up, to attract a wide variety of other marine engineering work to the yard, will likely be set back. One of them is a big chunk of the work on the next generation of Royal Navy frigates, in a consortium including Babcock in Rosyth. Some potential work at Port Glasgow may already have been lost Now it's merely my hunch, but might the sales force see more of a career future with international business investor Jim McColl than with economy minister Derek Mackay? I'm told that some potential clients wanting to place work at the Port Glasgow yard have been delayed by the CalMac ferries dispute. At least one contract has gone to the Netherlands, without Ferguson having the capacity at present to bid. Plans to take over an enormous dry dock, also in Inverclyde, will require government capital, if it is to be the owner, and if Clydeport's owner, Peel Ports, is willing to sell. Instead of further diversifying, government ownership will likely focus on securing jobs in a yard which looks well placed to reduce the backlog of CalMac ferries by servicing a regular drumbeat of orders. But constrained by Scottish government capital funds, that is thought unlikely to sustain the 350-strong workforce currently there, or to grow it beyond 600, which Jim McColl had targeted. It's also questionable whether a state-owned yard can assume that government contracts will inevitably fall to it.  In or out of the European Union, some state aid rules are surely likely to apply. Some form of competitive bidding is widely seen as the best way of ensuring value for public procurement pounds. Removing that element is an invitation to run the contracts inefficiently, and to the fiat of ministers. In any case, it's not clear that anyone in the Scottish government or CMAL knows what went so badly wrong with the current contract that the cost is coming in at double the price.  (And who is to say it won't continue to rise?) It should surely be a high priority that someone figures that out soon.

"The delayed ferries are at the centre of a row between Ferguson Marine and the Scottish government's ferry company An offer to hand a share of ownership in Ferguson shipyard has been rejected by the Scottish government. The latest encounter in their dispute makes it more likely the yard will be fully taken over by ministers. Finance Secretary Derek Mackay wants to ensure two Cal-Mac ferries are delivered and the yard, which employs 350 workers, is kept open. The Â£97m contract is behind schedule and considerably over budget, and the company's finances are precarious. The lifeline ferry deal that went adrift Shipshape: when the state steps in Who pays the ferryman? Stage set for legal battle The Port Glasgow yard's owner, Clyde Blowers Capital, controlled by industrial tycoon Jim McColl, tabled the new proposal on Monday. It also presented legal advice, commissioned by Clyde Blowers Capital, that the proposed deal would be within European rules on procurement and state aid - the extent to which governments are allowed to intervene in support of businesses. That advice has been flatly rejected by the Scottish government, saying it is obliged to seek the lowest cost option. The dispute could lead to it using a clause in the Â£45m of loan agreements between the Scottish government and Ferguson Marine Engineering Limited (FMEL), through which it could take over the yard for only Â£1. It is understood that a separate private lender debt, providing a Â£25m bond required of FMEL to ensure delivery of the ferries, is secured against ownership of the land, rather than the plant and business on it. The two ships being built for Cal-Mac, the Scottish government-owned ferry company, have caused particular difficulties because of their innovative hybrid power systems, using diesel and liquefied natural gas. FMEL claims numerous design changes have been required by the client, government-owned Caledonian Marine Assets Limited, which leases to Cal-Mac, and that a new design such as this requires repeated certification by the shipping regulator. Although it has been paid most of the Â£97m for the fixed price contract, the firm faces a uncertain future without an injection of funds. Estimates of the overspend are now at least Â£60m.  Jim McColl wants the taxpayer to meet some of the extra cost. His proposal sought to share the cost, with an offer that would mean the Scottish government taking on a stake in the company. Legal advice for ministers says this would be open to legal challenge from firms that did not win the ferry contract. More significant could be the problem with state aid rules - the European law limiting a government's ability to support a company against its rivals. In rejecting the legal advice to Clyde Blowers Capital, the Scottish government claims it is required to keep public expenditure to the lowest level possible. That either means more injection of capital from Clyde Blowers, to cover the extra cost of the ferry contract, or the takeover of the business by the Scottish government. Use of the clause that allows a takeover of the loan conditions are breached, and for only Â£1, would avoid administration. Jim McColl met Inverclyde councillors this week - both the Labour council leader Steven McCabe and SNP opposition leader Chris McEleny - to explain the proposal. A mass meeting of the workforce on Wednesday also heard about the legal advice supporting it. In the official response from the Scottish government - though not conveyed to the company - a spokesman said: ""We share the determination to ensure a strong, long term future for Ferguson's. ""This proposal has formed part of the discussions with CBC over a number of weeks. However we have been clear that their proposal contained a number of serious risks to the public purse, including risks in propriety, regularity and value for money, and that we are unable to take this forward for those reasons. ""We remain open to any workable proposals and to any commercial investment CBC wish to make."" A spokesman for FMEL said: ""We continue to engage with both the Scottish government and CMAL, and remain fully committed to ensuring the construction of the CMAL vessels, while guaranteeing the ability of the business to continue with its diversification and growth strategy and to maintain and exploit its leading position in the development of hydrogen propulsion technology.""

"When Ferguson Shipbuilders went bust in the summer of 2014 it seemed the last shipyard on the lower Clyde was heading for oblivion, more than a century after it was founded by the four Ferguson brothers. But within weeks, in a deal brokered by then First Minister Alex Salmond, a white knight stepped forward in the shape of Jim McColl. A self-made billionaire, he was one of the most prominent business figures to support Scottish independence ahead of the referendum in September that year. Jim McColl stepped in to rescue the shipyard in 2014 McColl, who made his fortune transforming the ailing Clyde Blowers into a portfolio of engineering investment companies, was adamant that Scottish shipbuilding could have a bright future. Investment swiftly followed - the old buildings were demolished and replaced by state-of-the-art fabrication and design facilities. The workforce at Ferguson Marine Engineering Ltd (FMEL) as it became known, rose from about 70 to 350, including apprenticeships in one of the most socially deprived areas of Scotland. The workforce at Ferguson Marine rose five-fold after its takeover by Jim McColl The new owner had plenty of ideas for the yard's future - refitting superyachts, fishing vessels, a new generation of hydrogen-powered ships. Ferguson was also part of the consortium which was eventually named preferred bidder to build the Royal Navy's new Type 31e frigates. Early work, however, came in the shape of orders for Scotland's publicly-owned ferry firm Caldedonian MacBrayne. When McColl took over the yard it already had an order for a small diesel/electric hybrid ferry to keep it going - but in 2015 it received a major boost when it won a Â£97m order for two much larger ships. Ironically this apparent lifeline was to have catastrophic consequences for the shipyard, eventually plunging it back into administration. Call to scrap ferries and start again Costs double on delayed ferry contract Ferguson shipyard taken into public ownership Early fabrication work on Glen Sannox which is still not ready seven years since the award of the contract The ferries  were to be a hybrid design, powered by marine diesel oil and liquefied natural gas - not a particularly new technology in worldwide terms but a first for a UK shipyard. The hull of the first ship - Glen Sannox - soon started taking shape - but behind the scenes something was going badly wrong. The yard was undergoing major redevelopment, and the original plan to build the two ships concurrently soon foundered. Glen Sannox -  destined for the Arran route - came off the slipway in November 2017 at a launch attended by First Minister Nicola Sturgeon. But the ship was far from finished. Despite the fanfare the more eagle-eyed among the cheering crowds might have noticed that the windows of the bridge were filled not with glass but painted boards. The ship was expected to enter service in mid-2018 but more than four years after its launch it remains moored beside the yard while work continues. The second ferry, currently known as hull 802, earmarked for the Skye, Harris and North Uist route, is still being constructed and won't be ready until summer 2023 at the earliest. The cost of the work has risen to about Â£240m, more than double the original fixed price cost, and despite some controversial loans totalling Â£45m from the Scottish government the shipyard went bust in the summer of 2019. Scottish ministers had been unwilling to stump up more cash, arguing to do so would break state aid rules. Instead they ended up nationalising the yard, safeguarding jobs - but landing the public purse with a bill in excess of Â£100m to finish the ships. There's been a lot of finger pointing. Jim McColl has repeatedly laid the blame for the problems at the door of CMAL- the company that owns and manages ferries and other assets on behalf of the Scottish government. In a BBC interviewhe accused CMAL of making repeated specification changes - a claim denied by CMAL. The hybrid propulsion design also required lengthy certification processes from insurers and regulators, he said. In its accounts his company FMEL blamed unforeseen costs on  ""post contract award, variations, interference, and disruption caused by the customer"". But that customer, CMAL, painted a different picture, accusing FMEL of rushing ahead with construction before completing the design work and getting the blueprints signed off. After ministers took over the yard, agovernment report,externalblamed poor project management while McColl's firm was in charge and a lack of financial controls. Glen Sannox was launched in November 2017 - but there was still no glass in the windows McColl hit back, again insisting the fault lay chiefly with CMAL and suggestingit would have been cheaper to scrap the ferries and start againwith a simpler design. Last year a damning report from a cross-party committee of MSP branded the whole affair a ""catastrophic failure"". Allof the main protagonists, it said - FMEL, CMAL, Transport Scotland, government ministers - must take some responsibility for what went wrong. A recent report from Audit Scotland also found multiple failings - but said one key mistake was the government's awarding of the contract to Ferguson, against the advice of CMAL,despite it being unable to provide normal refund guaranteesshould something go wrong. Nicola Sturgeon has indicated that decision was taken by former transport minister Derek Mackay - who later resigned from government amid a scandal over social media messages to a teenage boy.  But the first minister says there was collective responsibility and""the buck stops with me"". The only group consistently absolved of blame are the workers at Ferguson shipyard itself whose morale has been sorely tested by the saga. One of them recently told his local MSP he was embarrassed to work at the yard. The latest bill for the ships is more than Â£250m, and they are now due to be delivered five years late in 2023 -  provided more problems aren't encountered. The ferry deal was meant to provide a lifeline to a once proud workforce, but it ended up dragging down the Clyde's last commercial shipyard - and the saga isn't over yet.

"A BBC Weather Watcher photographed flooding on a road in St Andrews Travellers in Scotland have been given a fresh warning that difficult weather conditions could continue for much of the weekend. The Met Office also issued a yellow warning for heavy showers and thunderstorms continuing until Sunday. Fifteen flood alerts have been put in place by the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (Sepa). Much of Scotland was already on alert as heavy rain lashed large parts of the country. Why is August Scotland's wettest summer month? Met Office chief meteorologist Neil Armstrong said: ""This low-pressure system will bring challenging conditions, including unseasonably strong winds and heavy rain, from the west during Friday and Saturday. ""Summer storms - compared with those in autumn and winter - always have the potential to create additional impacts because more people are likely to be outdoors, especially by the coast. ""Additionally, with trees in full leaf they are more vulnerable to being brought down by strong winds."" Katie Archibald prepares to lead her team out in Dundee One of the events affected by weather conditions was the Women's Tour of Scotland. Organisers of the cycling race, taking place for the first time, said the first stage - from Dundee to Dunfermline -had been abandoned due to ""extreme weather conditions"". Stage two - still scheduled for Saturday - is from Glasgow to Perth. Surface water caused difficulties for motorists on Friday and ferries were disrupted by high winds. Rail services between Fort William and Mallaig have been replaced by buses after a steam train hit a tree. And trains through Bishopton in Renfrewshire were cancelled for the remainder of the day after a tree fell on overhead wires at about 09:15. The loss of power to the overhead lines left about 200 passengers stranded on three trains in the area for about two hours. Three trains were brought to a halt near Bishopton A ""rescue train"" was brought in to remove those on board and they disembarked at Bishopton at 11:30. ScotRail said engineers were working to repair the ""significant damage"" affecting services between Glasgow Central and Gourock/Wemyss Bay. The disruption was expected to last into the weekend as the rail firm said the repair work would be completed by midday on Saturday. ""We're sorry to customers who've been affected by this, and share their frustrations,"" a spokesman added. ""To keep people moving, we're operating a shuttle service between Glasgow and Paisley, and customers can use their train tickets on selected local buses."" ScotRail said on Friday that services between Dunblane - Edinburgh and Glasgow Queen Street were running as normal after major disruption on Thursday. However, disruption to trains between Glasgow Queen Street and Crianlarich / Oban is expected until the end of Monday and the Highland Sleeper will not run between Edinburgh and Fort William, after the line was damaged by heavy rain. The line between Ardlui and Crainlarichwill not reopen until 22 August, Network Rail said. A number of routes in southern Scotland have been affected by fallen trees In Dumfries and Galloway a driver had a lucky escape after a tree fell on a car near Castle Douglas. Police said the motorist had walked away uninjured but a number of trees were down across the region. Transport Scotland said the heavy rain means saturated ground and areas already hit by flooding may be affected again. A spokesman said: ""This will cause challenging conditions for drivers and commuters, and we would again urge the public to check before they travel, follow police advice, and to drive to the conditions, where routes are passable. ""Planning is under way to prepare for the continued heavy rainfall to allow for early interventions, such as having pumps ready and available in an effort to avoid further closures at known sites. However, the sheer volume of rain does make this challenging."" Why is August Scotland's wettest summer month? Cyclist makes it through flood water in Edinburgh.

"An independent review into fears of contamination at a school campus in North Lanarkshire has said that the schools are safe. The report,externalsaid there was no link between Buchanan and St Ambrose high schools in Coatbridge and ill health. It also said water samples passed drinking water standards and soil samples were ""not of concern"". But the report did criticise North Lanarkshire Council for its ""slow and defensive response"" to the fears. One parent told BBC Scotland that despite the findings, she was still not satisfied and would not be sending her children to St Ambrose School when it reopens next week. Parents and pupils joined teachers on the picket line at Buchanan High School before the summer holidays The campus was built on a landfill site that contained lead and arsenic. As part of the review, water, soil and air samples from the former landfill site were assessed, along with the integrity of the methane membrane, which was installed as a safety measure during construction of the campus. The review team found that one soil sample on the periphery of the site had elevated levels of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) - a chemical subject to an international industrial ban. They recommend that North Lanarkshire Council completes a full and independently verified removal of the chemical as soon as possible as a precaution. Other findings included: Parents and teachers were right to raise concerns North Lanarkshire Council and NHS Lanarkshire's reactions were too slow and too defensive There is no link between hazards at the site and ill health The risk from hazardous contaminants in the soil is very low Recommendations: To address elevated levels of PCBs from a peripheral part of the site Take more water samples in the coming months to address minor quality issues Set up a site recovery group to enable information to be shared and concerns to be raised Periodic testing results for the methane membrane to be made public as soon as possible Public health consultant Dr Margaret Hannah, who co-led the review, said: ""Many people were concerned about possible health risks from the previous use of the campus site. We listened carefully to the concerns of parents and teachers and worked with various experts in their field to determine the areas to test within the campus. ""Our principal finding is that the schools are safe, the site is safe and there is no link between the school and the reported health issues. However, we have made recommendations for some work to be carried out in order to provide further public reassurance."" Dr Margaret Hannah spoke to parents at the school One of the group's recommendations is to create a site recovery group that will enable information to be shared and concerns to be raised. ""Working together is key to restoring public confidence and we hope our findings will help all the communities in Coatbridge and beyond work towards common goals and in the best interests of the pupils and staff,"" Dr Hannah said. Deputy First Minister John Swinney said the report - commissioned by the Scottish government - ""provided reassurance"" to parents, pupils and staff. But he added: ""The review also finds, however, that North Lanarkshire Council and NHS Lanarkshire did not handle this issue at all well. They did not engage with parents sufficiently early or in an inclusive manner. ""The recommendations will ensure statutory bodies engage far more proactively with parents, staff and pupils to rebuild the trust and learn lessons from this for the future."" This video can not be played Lisa McCormick says she has ""no trust or faith"" in North Lanarkshire Council However, parent Lisa McCormick said she was ""still not satisfied"". ""I'm quite worried because of the short time the review team had,"" she said. ""Did that actually compromise their findings because they had such a tight timescale to do it all in? ""I'm not convinced 100%. My kids will still not be going back to the school. That comes down to North Lanarkshire Council's behaviour. I've got no trust or faith in them whatsoever. ""That will never, ever, be repaired for me personally. We've got the information we need... I can walk away knowing that that school just isn't right for my children."" The EIS teaching union's general secretary Larry Flanagan said: ""Whilst we accept the majority of the inquiry's conclusions, it is clear that the concerns at these schools should have been treated very differently by North Lanarkshire Council. ""Its mishandling of the situation on several occasions has increased stress and anxiety levels amongst teachers, parents and pupils. ""It is essential that the council now works positively to rebuild trust with all members of the school communities."" Parents âin limboâ ahead of school review findings Water to be tested at health fear schools Teachers on strike at health fear campus Parents want new tests at 'sick' school On Thursday, 36 members of the NASUWT teaching unionthreatened to go on strike from the first day of the new termunless they were satisfied the site posed no risks. Acting general secretary Chris Keates said the report was now being examined but in the meantime the planned strike action remained in place for Monday. She said the union would keep the position under review. NASUWT members went on strike over health concerns in June Robert Steenson, executive director for enterprise and communities at North Lanarkshire Council, said: ""We are pleased that the independent review agrees with the council's position throughout, which is that the schools are safe and that there is no link between the schools and any serious illness."" He said the council would implement the recommendations, and accepted that concerns over blue water on the site could have been dealt with at an earlier stage. ""However, all pipework has now been replaced and water fully complies with drinking quality standards,"" he added. The schools are due to reopen to pupils next week. Gabe Docherty, director of public health at NHS Lanarkshire said: ""It's vital that school life returns to normal as soon as possible and this report provides the peace-of-mind to enable that to happen."" The two school buildings, along with Townhead Community Centre, opened in 2012 on a site that was used as landfill for industrial waste, including lead and arsenic, between 1945 and 1972. Steps were taken to make the grounds safe before the campus opened in 2012, including bringing in fresh top soil. But in March 2018, staff and students were given bottled water amid concerns about blue-tinted water coming from the taps. Tests revealed higher than recommended levels of copper. It was blamed on corrosion and the pipes have since been replaced. However, safety fears came to a head earlier this year after it emerged that four former or current members of staff at Buchanan High had been treated for cancer. North Lanarkshire Council and NHS Lanarkshire said specialists did not believe cancer - or any other serious illness - was caused by the schools or the site on which they were built. But it failed to allay the concerns of parents, pupils and staff and in June the Scottish government ordered an immediate review into health and safety at the campus. A number of parents withdrew their children from the school and some teachers went on strike, with the NASUWT calling for the schools to close early for summer. North Lanarkshire Councilhas long maintained that there is no evidenceto show that the schools and the wider campus was unsafe. And in June thelocal authority created a leaflet,externalto provide further information and reassurance to parents, staff and pupils.

"Preparing for the possibility of a no-deal Brexit should be ""the top priority"" for civil servants, Boris Johnson has told them in a letter. The PM said he would prefer to get a deal with the EU, but he said he recognised this ""may not happen"". Earlier Jeremy Corbyn had urged the UK's top civil servant to intervene to prevent a no-deal Brexit happening during a general election campaign. It comes amid speculation MPs could back a no-confidence motion in the PM. In his letter to civil servants, Mr Johnson said the UK must be prepared to leave the EU by the latest Brexit deadline of 31 October ""whatever the circumstances"". ""That is why preparing urgently and rapidly for the possibility of an exit without a deal will be my top priority, and it will be the top priority for the civil service too."" It is understood that government special advisers also received an email last night from the PM's senior adviser Eddie Lister instructing them not to take annual leave until after 31 October. No deal during election 'anti-democratic' - Corbyn Is it too late to hold an election before Brexit? Javid to HMRC: Make no-deal planning top priority Mr Johnson's message to civil servants follows a similar letter sent by Chancellor Sajid Javid earlier this month to HM Revenue and Customs. Mr Javid also ordered the tax authority to make preparing for no-deal its ""absolute top priority"", including helping the public to prepare for the possibility. He said this should include making sure IT systems are ready, helping businesses with a helpline, and contacting traders directly. In hisletter,externalto Cabinet Secretary Sir Mark Sedwill, Mr Corbyn said it would be an ""anti-democratic abuse of power"" if the PM allowed a no-deal to occur by default during a general election campaign, if the government was defeated in a vote of no confidence. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell has said it is ""almost inevitable"" that Labour would push for such a vote when the Commons returns from its summer recess on 3 September. It is thought MPs opposed to no-deal could back the vote in a bid to prevent the UK leaving the EU without an agreement - leading to a general election being called. Election rules say Parliament should be dissolved 25 working days before polling day - so some people are concerned Mr Johnson could allow a no-deal Brexit to happen while MPs are not sitting. According to the Sunday Telegraph, Mr Johnson's senior adviser at No 10, Dominic Cummings, has told MPs even losing such a vote could not stop the PM taking the UK out of the EU on 31 October. Hereportedly saidMr Johnson could call an election for after the deadline, with Brexit taking place in the meantime. Theresa May's Brexit deal was rejected three times by MPs and, as things stand, the UK will leave the EU on 31 October whether it has agreed a new one or not. Mr Johnson has urged the EU to make changes to the deal, but has said the UK must leave by this deadline with or without an agreement. Many of those who voted against the deal had concerns over the backstop, which if implemented, would see Northern Ireland staying aligned to some rules of the EU single market. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. It would also see the UK stay in a single customs territory with the EU, and align with current and future EU rules on competition and state aid. These arrangements would apply unless and until both the EU and UK agreed they were no longer necessary. On Thursday Mr Johnson again urged the EU to compromise on the Irish borderbackstop plan, designed to guarantee there will not be a hard Irish border after Brexit. However, the EU has continued to insist that the withdrawal deal agreed by Mrs May last year, including the backstop, cannot be renegotiated. Meanwhile, a transport minister has said he supports the government position of leaving the EU in all circumstances, following comments he made about a no-deal Brexit. George Freeman toldHuffPost UK's Commons People podcast,externalit would be an ""absolute disaster"" for the UK in the long term if it only traded with the EU on WTO [World Trade Organization] terms, without its own free trade deal with the bloc. But he later tweeted to say he ""totally supports"" the position that the UK should leave with no deal on 31 October, ""if the EU is unwilling to negotiate"". In response, Downing Street told the BBC that Mr Freeman has the ""full support of the prime minister"".

"""Manipulative and evil"" Ben Field left messages on one of his elderly victim's mirrors and persuaded her they were from God As Ben Field sat in the back of a police van after his arrest, he said: ""I think I will get away with most of it."" He had seduced two lonely neighbours - murdering one and defrauding the other - but now faces life in prison. On the surface, 28-year-old Field was a charming, caring and religious young man who gave sermons in his father's Baptist church. But the former churchwarden had a sinister project: to befriend vulnerable individuals and get them to change their wills. Mark Glover, who led the Thames Valley Police investigation into his crimes, summed him up: ""Ben Field is all about Ben Field and nobody else."" Peter Farquhar and Ann Moore-Martin were both lonely and vulnerable Field, of Olney, Bucks, has beenconvicted of murder and fraud after a 10-week trial. He was described by police as a ""cold, calculated, manipulative, controlling, evil man"". The court was told he targeted two lonely neighbours who lived a few doors from each other in the village of Maids Moreton, Buckinghamshire. Peter Farquhar, 69, was a guest lecturer at the University of Buckingham, where Field had studied English literature. Ann Moore-Martin, 83, was a retired head teacher. Both victims were deeply religious, single and had no children. Mr Farquhar had a wide circle of friends and acquaintances and was well-travelled, but he was also lonely. A gay man, he struggled with his sexuality, regarding it as incompatible with his Anglican faith. Miss Moore-Martin was Catholic and also went to church regularly. She, like her neighbour, had friends aplenty but was fiercely private. She was very close to her niece, so much so, they regarded each other as mother and daughter. Field seduced both his victims and they were besotted with him. Mr Farquhar thought he had found someone to love and grow old with, while Miss Moore-Martin's sister-in-law said she seemed hypnotised by him, like ""a love-struck teenager"". The defendant proposed marriage to them both and even held a betrothal ceremony with Mr Farquhar in March 2014. Mr Farquhar and Field held a betrothal ceremony in 2014 While Mr Farquhar wrote in his journal, ""it is one of the happiest moments of my life. Gone are the fears of dying alone"", the court was told Field's motive was purely financial gain and that he was also seeing other people. If he was to inherit Mr Farquhar's house, his victim had to die. And if he was to get away with it, his death needed to look like an accident or suicide. Field drugged Mr Farquhar, secretly spiking his food and drink by feeding him a cocktail of sedatives and hallucinogens bought off the internet. They were covertly administered in various ways - on his toast, in his tea and broken up in chocolate. A video, found in Field's possession, shows the academic looking exhausted and struggling to form a sentence. This video can not be played Field filmed Mr Farquhar after he had been drugged Before his death, Mr Farquhar told friends he was suffering from night terrors, hallucinations and bouts of sleepwalking. Some of his friends thought he had become confused or appeared drunk. He told friends he thought he was losing his mind and compared himself to Shakespeare's King Lear. Field constructed a narrative to explain Mr Farquhar's behaviour. He told friends he was ill, or that he was drinking more than usual. The prosecution said Field was treated as someone shouldering the burden of looking after him. In court, Field admitted drugging Mr Farquhar, telling jurors he did it because his partner would often be awake in the middle of night and active in the house, which would disrupt his own sleep. Mr Farquhar would often fall over after being drugged by Field For months, Mr Farquhar was tormented by his ""mystery illness"". He saw a number of doctors including a neurologist and had various medical tests. But Field rang NHS 111 and 999 and lied to health workers, telling them the retired lecturer was ""a frequent faller"" who probably had dementia. The court heard Field ""gaslighted"" both his victims, manipulating them psychologically so they ended up doubting their memory and sanity. Field moved things around the house so Mr Farquhar would get irritated and confused when he couldn't find them - only for Field to arrive and find the missing items immediately. The jury was told how Field publicly humiliated Mr Farquhar at a book launch at Stowe School by slipping him hallucinogenic drugs. He had retired as the public school's head of English in 2004 to concentrate on writing novels and one book launch attracted a large number of friends. Those who attended told a similar story of a frail, confused and apologetic man slumped at a table, visibly struggling to sign books, who at one point thought he was being attacked by shards of light. In October 2015, Mr Farquhar died. He was discovered in his living room by his cleaner, a half empty bottle of whisky beside him. His friends thought he had drunk himself to death - as did the coroner, who certified his cause of death as acute alcohol intoxication. But, during the trial, the prosecution said Field had ""suffocated him"" when he was too weak to resist. Before his death, Mr Farquhar had changed his will, giving Field a life interest in his house. When the house was sold, he split the proceeds with Mr Farquhar's brother. Mr Farquhar lived a few doors away from Miss Moore-Martin Field had been introduced to Miss Moore-Martin by Mr Farquhar and the defendant pursued her in the same way, taking advantage of her loneliness and working his way into her affections. Despite the 57-year age gap, they developed a sexual relationship. Unbeknown to her, he took a photograph of her performing a sex act on him. During his evidence he said he thought it could be used as something to blackmail her with if he needed to. He gave her a number of items so she would feel closer to him. These included a framed picture of him with the words ""I am always with you"" written in capitals beneath his image, which she placed above her dressing table. He gave her a hand counter and told her to click it every time she thought of him. In one note, she said she was concerned she had not seen him for several days, and wrote: ""My hand tally counter is being well used!"" In another note, the words ""clickety x click!"" appeared next to hand-drawn flowers and the words ""I love you"". Miss Moore-Martin wrote Field a letter When Field wanted money, he lied about needing a new car and Miss Moore-Martin gave him Â£4,400. He told her his younger brother, Tom Field, was seriously ill with a kidney condition and needed a dialysis machine. It was another lie, but she was taken in and handed over Â£27,000. In a recording of a phone call played in court, Field was heard ringing her bank then handing her the phone so she could speak to the operator about releasing money from bonds. She told the bank: ""I'm thinking of withdrawing all the money held in my accountsâ¦ I have a very dear friend who is the brother of another dear friend. He's extremely ill, he's got kidney difficulties and is likely to die if he doesn't have his own dialysis machine and I've been thinking of a way in which I can help him."" She ended the call by saying: ""In life, one must not be selfish and keep everything to yourself."" This video can not be played Miss Moore-Martin told her bank ""one must not be selfish"" as she withdrew Â£27,000 in savings Field's deceit extended to writing messages on his deeply religious victim's mirror, in the hope she would believe they were messages from God. In his sketch books he planned the messages - how the writing would look, what the messages would say and what reasons there could be for them appearing.  Some of the messages told her to leave her house to Field. It worked and she changed her will. In February 2017, Miss Moore-Martin became ill and suffered a seizure. It was during her hospital stay she confided in her niece about her relationship with Field and the writing on the mirrors. The police became involved and an investigation started. Miss Moore-Martin reversed her will and changed it back to benefit her family and in May 2017 she died of natural causes in a care home. Her niece, Anne-Marie Blake, told the court that before she died her aunt had begun to realise she had been duped and could not believe she had been so stupid as to fall for Field's lies. ""She was tortured by it and found it very difficult to get her head around the betrayal,"" she said. Field left messages ""from God"" for Miss Moore-Martin as part of his campaign to get her to make him the beneficiary of her will Mrs Blake said when she met Field at her aunt's house after her hospital admission, she thought his manner was ""weird"". She challenged him and asked if he had been taking things from her aunt's home, accepting money from her and trying to change her will. He said he had. She also asked him whether he was in love with her aunt to which he said ""yes"". During her stay in hospital, Field tried to visit her but he was denied access. The court heard he complained to the police and told the call operator: ""A friend of mine was admitted to hospital and when I called the hospital and tried to visit, security have said that I can't see her and for more information I need to contact the police. ""I was calling to see if I could find out anything or what had been said about me, what the situation was."" In court he admitted he had made the calls to see how much the police knew about him and whether he was in trouble. His barrister, David Jeremy QC, asked him what had been the purpose of the call, and he replied: ""To find out if my fraud was rumbled or not."" The police investigation established the link between Field, Miss Moore-Martin and Mr Farquhar and 19 months after the latter's death a decision was taken to exhume his body. A second post-mortem examination established he had consumed less alcohol than had been thought and there were sedatives in his system. Ann Moore-Martin was ""like a love-struck teenager"" around Field, according to her niece Dr Brett Lockyer, a consultant forensic pathologist, said Mr Farquhar died as a result of the combined effects of alcohol and flurazepam, which could have affected his breathing. He said he could not rule out that Mr Farquhar might also been smothered with a pillow. The pathologist said a toxicological analysis showed Mr Farquhar had been repeatedly exposed to lorazepam in the two months before he died, as well as other sedatives. Field was arrested and his home was searched, where police found diaries and notebooks containing a list of people's names with the title,100 Clients. It was described by Field in court as a list of ""people who may be useful to me, either as targets of fraud or in other ways"". Members of his own family were listed - and so was Miss Moore-Martin. Books about poisoning people and planning a suicide were also discovered. Principal investigator Mr Glover said: ""[Field] got massive pleasure from other people's misery and pain and it was all about financial gain or gain in some shape or form to Ben Field. [He was] a nasty, cruel man."" Although he denied planning to kill the two neighbours he did admit to being in fraudulent relationships with them as part of a plot to get them to change their wills. Field also pleaded guilty to defrauding Miss Moore-Martin out of money he said was for a car and a dialysis machine, but was acquitted of conspiring to kill her. He stood trial alongside his friend, magician Martyn Smith, 32, from Redruth in Cornwall, who was accused of murder, conspiracy to murder, fraud and burglary. He was acquitted of all the charges. Field's younger brother, Tom Field, 24, from Olney, was also acquitted of one count of fraud. Ben Field is now facing a life sentence, but his early confidence that he would ""get away with most of it"" - secretly recorded while he sat in a police van - was not entirely misplaced. ""In terms of the death of Peter Farquhar, there's a very good chance that Benjamin Field would have got away with that death had it not been for the suspicions that were raised once Ann Moore-Martin was removed from Benjamin's control,"" said Chris Derrick, of the Crown Prosecution Service. ""In fact, at that stage he had already gotten away with it - it was only due to the new forensics that came from exhuming the body that we were able to build a case that indicated Benjamin Field had in fact killed Peter.""

"A BBC Weather Watcher photographed flooding on a road in St Andrews Travellers in Scotland have been given a fresh warning that difficult weather conditions could continue for much of the weekend. The Met Office also issued a yellow warning for heavy showers and thunderstorms continuing until Sunday. Fifteen flood alerts have been put in place by the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (Sepa). Much of Scotland was already on alert as heavy rain lashed large parts of the country. Why is August Scotland's wettest summer month? Met Office chief meteorologist Neil Armstrong said: ""This low-pressure system will bring challenging conditions, including unseasonably strong winds and heavy rain, from the west during Friday and Saturday. ""Summer storms - compared with those in autumn and winter - always have the potential to create additional impacts because more people are likely to be outdoors, especially by the coast. ""Additionally, with trees in full leaf they are more vulnerable to being brought down by strong winds."" Katie Archibald prepares to lead her team out in Dundee One of the events affected by weather conditions was the Women's Tour of Scotland. Organisers of the cycling race, taking place for the first time, said the first stage - from Dundee to Dunfermline -had been abandoned due to ""extreme weather conditions"". Stage two - still scheduled for Saturday - is from Glasgow to Perth. Surface water caused difficulties for motorists on Friday and ferries were disrupted by high winds. Rail services between Fort William and Mallaig have been replaced by buses after a steam train hit a tree. And trains through Bishopton in Renfrewshire were cancelled for the remainder of the day after a tree fell on overhead wires at about 09:15. The loss of power to the overhead lines left about 200 passengers stranded on three trains in the area for about two hours. Three trains were brought to a halt near Bishopton A ""rescue train"" was brought in to remove those on board and they disembarked at Bishopton at 11:30. ScotRail said engineers were working to repair the ""significant damage"" affecting services between Glasgow Central and Gourock/Wemyss Bay. The disruption was expected to last into the weekend as the rail firm said the repair work would be completed by midday on Saturday. ""We're sorry to customers who've been affected by this, and share their frustrations,"" a spokesman added. ""To keep people moving, we're operating a shuttle service between Glasgow and Paisley, and customers can use their train tickets on selected local buses."" ScotRail said on Friday that services between Dunblane - Edinburgh and Glasgow Queen Street were running as normal after major disruption on Thursday. However, disruption to trains between Glasgow Queen Street and Crianlarich / Oban is expected until the end of Monday and the Highland Sleeper will not run between Edinburgh and Fort William, after the line was damaged by heavy rain. The line between Ardlui and Crainlarichwill not reopen until 22 August, Network Rail said. A number of routes in southern Scotland have been affected by fallen trees In Dumfries and Galloway a driver had a lucky escape after a tree fell on a car near Castle Douglas. Police said the motorist had walked away uninjured but a number of trees were down across the region. Transport Scotland said the heavy rain means saturated ground and areas already hit by flooding may be affected again. A spokesman said: ""This will cause challenging conditions for drivers and commuters, and we would again urge the public to check before they travel, follow police advice, and to drive to the conditions, where routes are passable. ""Planning is under way to prepare for the continued heavy rainfall to allow for early interventions, such as having pumps ready and available in an effort to avoid further closures at known sites. However, the sheer volume of rain does make this challenging."" Why is August Scotland's wettest summer month? Cyclist makes it through flood water in Edinburgh.

"This video can not be played A full-size helter-skelter has been constructed inside Norwich Cathedral The clergy at a cathedral has been accused of being unprofessional and ""poisoning the medicine"" a church offers by installing a fairground ride. A full-size helter-skelter has been put in the nave of Norwich Cathedral to give people a different view of the inside of the building. The Right Reverend Dr Gavin Ashenden, former chaplain to the Queen, said the cathedral had made a ""mistake"". The cathedral said it was a creative way to share the story of the Bible. The Very Reverend Jane Hedges takes a ride on the helter-skelter It took four people two days to build the 55ft (16.7m) fairground ride in the Norman cathedral. The cathedral said it allowed people to stand close to its medieval roof bosses, believed to be the largest display of its kind in the world. Dr Ashenden, Missionary Bishop for the Christian Episcopal Church, said the clergy at Norwich Cathedral had been ""unprofessional"" and were ""making a mistake about what a cathedral is good for"". He said there was no evidence that tourists become Christians and ""just to put in entertainment is naff"". ""For such a place, steeped in mystery and marvel to buy in to sensory pleasure and distraction, is to poison the very medicine it offers the human soul,"" he said. The Right Reverend Dr Gavin Ashenden said the helter-skelter was a ""mistake"" The helter-skelter has been installed in the nave of Norwich Cathedral The Reverend Canon Andy Bryant, from Norwich Cathedral, said he could see why people would be surprised to see the helter-skelter. But in addition to showcasing the roof, he said it was ""part of the cathedral's mission to share the story of the Bible"" and was a ""creative and innovative way to do that"". Norwich Cathedral is not the only place of worship to use unconventional methods to attract members of the public.

"Sum Bora became trapped after trying to retrieve his torch A Cambodian man has been rescued after being trapped in a cave for four days whilst collecting bat droppings. Sum Bora slipped between two rocks on Sunday while trying to retrieve his torch, police in the north-western province of Battambang said. The 28-year-old, left without food or water, was found on Tuesday after his family began looking for him. He was retrieved after a 10-hour operation involving 200 rescuers and is being treated at a local hospital. ""I had lost hope of staying alive and if I had a knife with me I'd have committed suicide,"" Mr Bora said in a video, according to the Khmer Times newspaper. The droppings - known as guano - can be used as fertiliser and are a lucrative commodity in Cambodia, one of South East Asia's poorest countries. Mr Bora was trapped inside the cave by Chakrai Mountain and was discovered by a friend who often joined him to collect guano. What to do to survive underground Achieving the impossible: Thai cave rescue a year on ""We're both small-built and can easily fit into narrow passages, so my friend was able to crawl through another passage to reach me inside the cave,"" he said. An elite rescue team was called in by Prime Minister Hun Sen to assist with the operation Rescuers later arrived at the scene, but were initially unable to extract him because the cave's entrance was too narrow. An elite rescue team was flown in by helicopter to assist with the operation, and Mr Bora was recovered on Wednesday after parts of the cave were destroyed to clear enough space. Mr Bora and his family have received money and food donations after the rescue received national attention In a statement, Mr Bora's wife, Koeun Sothea, said he was being treated for head, knee and chest injuries. Ms Sothea also thanked Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen for sending the rescue team and for donating $2,500 (Â£2,000) to their family. Police chief Sareth Viseth told local media that climbing Chakrai Mountain would now be banned to prevent any similar incidents.

"The UK's economy had zero growth in the third quarter of 2024, according to the latest official figures. The strength of the economy affects things like pay increases for workers and the amount of tax the government can raise to pay for services. GDP stands for gross domestic product, and is a measure of all the economic activity of companies, governments and people in a country. In the UK, the Office of National Statistics (ONS) publishesnew GDP figures every month,external. However, quarterly figures - covering three months at a time - are considered more important. Most economists, politicians and businesses like to see GDP rising steadily. That's because it usually means people are spending more, extra jobs are created, more tax is paid and workers get better pay rises. When GDP is falling, it means the economy is shrinking - which can be bad news for businesses and workers. If GDP falls for two quarters in a row, that is known asa recession, which can lead to pay freezes and job losses. The UK briefly fell into recession at the end of 2023, when the economy shrank in the last two quarters of the year. It rebounded in the first half of 2024, when GDP increased 0.7% between January and March, and0.5% between April and June,external. However, the economy had zero growth betweenJuly and September. The latest monthly figures show that GDPshrank by 0.1% in October. Analysts said the unexpected fall was linked to measures announcedin that month's Budget, including a rise in employernational insurance contributions (NICs)and ahigher minimum wage. In early December, the influential think tank the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) cut its growth forecast for the UK for 2024. It now expects the UK economy to grow by 0.9% across the year as a whole, down from its previous prediction of 1.1%. That would make it the fourth best performer in the G7 group of rich nations,according to the OECD,external, behind the US, Canada and France, but ahead of Italy, Germany and Japan. However, economic forecasts are not always accurate. If GDP is going up steadily, people pay more in tax because they're earning and spending more. This means more money for the government, which it can choose to spend on public services, such as schools, police and hospitals. When the economy shrinks and a country goes into recession, these things can go into reverse. Governments tend to get less money in tax, which means they may decide to freeze or cut public spending, or put taxes up. In 2020, the Covid pandemic caused the most severe UK recession for more than 300 years, which forced the government to borrow hundreds of billions of pounds to support the economy. How much money does the UK government raise and spend each year? Where does the government borrow billions from? GDP can be measured in three ways: Output: The total value of the goods and services produced by all sectors of the economy - agriculture, manufacturing, energy, construction, the service sector and government Expenditure:The value of goods and services bought by households and by government, investment in machinery and buildings - this also includes the value of exports, minus imports Income: The value of the income generated, mostly in terms of profits and wages In the UK, the ONS publishes one single measure of GDP, which is calculated using all three measurements. But early estimates mainly use the output measure, using data collected from thousands of companies. The UK produces one of the quickest estimates of GDP of the major economies, about 40 days after the quarter in question. At that stage, only about 60% of the data is available, so the figure is revised as more information comes in. The ONS publishes more information about thison its website,external. GDPdoesn't tell the whole story: the hidden economy:unpaid work such as caring for children or elderly relatives isn't captured inequality:it also doesn't show how income is split across a population - rising GDP could result from the richest getting richer, rather than everyone becoming better off, and some people could be worse off To try and address this, the ONS also publishes a figure for GDP per capita - or head of population - which can tell a different story. In fact, when you strip out inflation and population growth, the latest quarterly figures show thatGDP per capita actually fell by 0.1% between July and September 2024,external. Official GDP figures don't take into account unpaid work like looking after children Some critics also argue that GDP doesn't take into account whether the economic growth it measures is sustainable,or the environmental damage it might do. Alternative measures have been developed which try to capture this. Since 2010,the ONS has also measured well-being,externalalongside economic growth. This assesses health, relationships, education and skills, as well as people's personal finances and the environment. But despite its limitations, GDP is still the most widely-used measure for most government decisions and international comparisons.

"""Manipulative and evil"" Ben Field left messages on one of his elderly victim's mirrors and persuaded her they were from God As Ben Field sat in the back of a police van after his arrest, he said: ""I think I will get away with most of it."" He had seduced two lonely neighbours - murdering one and defrauding the other - but now faces life in prison. On the surface, 28-year-old Field was a charming, caring and religious young man who gave sermons in his father's Baptist church. But the former churchwarden had a sinister project: to befriend vulnerable individuals and get them to change their wills. Mark Glover, who led the Thames Valley Police investigation into his crimes, summed him up: ""Ben Field is all about Ben Field and nobody else."" Peter Farquhar and Ann Moore-Martin were both lonely and vulnerable Field, of Olney, Bucks, has beenconvicted of murder and fraud after a 10-week trial. He was described by police as a ""cold, calculated, manipulative, controlling, evil man"". The court was told he targeted two lonely neighbours who lived a few doors from each other in the village of Maids Moreton, Buckinghamshire. Peter Farquhar, 69, was a guest lecturer at the University of Buckingham, where Field had studied English literature. Ann Moore-Martin, 83, was a retired head teacher. Both victims were deeply religious, single and had no children. Mr Farquhar had a wide circle of friends and acquaintances and was well-travelled, but he was also lonely. A gay man, he struggled with his sexuality, regarding it as incompatible with his Anglican faith. Miss Moore-Martin was Catholic and also went to church regularly. She, like her neighbour, had friends aplenty but was fiercely private. She was very close to her niece, so much so, they regarded each other as mother and daughter. Field seduced both his victims and they were besotted with him. Mr Farquhar thought he had found someone to love and grow old with, while Miss Moore-Martin's sister-in-law said she seemed hypnotised by him, like ""a love-struck teenager"". The defendant proposed marriage to them both and even held a betrothal ceremony with Mr Farquhar in March 2014. Mr Farquhar and Field held a betrothal ceremony in 2014 While Mr Farquhar wrote in his journal, ""it is one of the happiest moments of my life. Gone are the fears of dying alone"", the court was told Field's motive was purely financial gain and that he was also seeing other people. If he was to inherit Mr Farquhar's house, his victim had to die. And if he was to get away with it, his death needed to look like an accident or suicide. Field drugged Mr Farquhar, secretly spiking his food and drink by feeding him a cocktail of sedatives and hallucinogens bought off the internet. They were covertly administered in various ways - on his toast, in his tea and broken up in chocolate. A video, found in Field's possession, shows the academic looking exhausted and struggling to form a sentence. This video can not be played Field filmed Mr Farquhar after he had been drugged Before his death, Mr Farquhar told friends he was suffering from night terrors, hallucinations and bouts of sleepwalking. Some of his friends thought he had become confused or appeared drunk. He told friends he thought he was losing his mind and compared himself to Shakespeare's King Lear. Field constructed a narrative to explain Mr Farquhar's behaviour. He told friends he was ill, or that he was drinking more than usual. The prosecution said Field was treated as someone shouldering the burden of looking after him. In court, Field admitted drugging Mr Farquhar, telling jurors he did it because his partner would often be awake in the middle of night and active in the house, which would disrupt his own sleep. Mr Farquhar would often fall over after being drugged by Field For months, Mr Farquhar was tormented by his ""mystery illness"". He saw a number of doctors including a neurologist and had various medical tests. But Field rang NHS 111 and 999 and lied to health workers, telling them the retired lecturer was ""a frequent faller"" who probably had dementia. The court heard Field ""gaslighted"" both his victims, manipulating them psychologically so they ended up doubting their memory and sanity. Field moved things around the house so Mr Farquhar would get irritated and confused when he couldn't find them - only for Field to arrive and find the missing items immediately. The jury was told how Field publicly humiliated Mr Farquhar at a book launch at Stowe School by slipping him hallucinogenic drugs. He had retired as the public school's head of English in 2004 to concentrate on writing novels and one book launch attracted a large number of friends. Those who attended told a similar story of a frail, confused and apologetic man slumped at a table, visibly struggling to sign books, who at one point thought he was being attacked by shards of light. In October 2015, Mr Farquhar died. He was discovered in his living room by his cleaner, a half empty bottle of whisky beside him. His friends thought he had drunk himself to death - as did the coroner, who certified his cause of death as acute alcohol intoxication. But, during the trial, the prosecution said Field had ""suffocated him"" when he was too weak to resist. Before his death, Mr Farquhar had changed his will, giving Field a life interest in his house. When the house was sold, he split the proceeds with Mr Farquhar's brother. Mr Farquhar lived a few doors away from Miss Moore-Martin Field had been introduced to Miss Moore-Martin by Mr Farquhar and the defendant pursued her in the same way, taking advantage of her loneliness and working his way into her affections. Despite the 57-year age gap, they developed a sexual relationship. Unbeknown to her, he took a photograph of her performing a sex act on him. During his evidence he said he thought it could be used as something to blackmail her with if he needed to. He gave her a number of items so she would feel closer to him. These included a framed picture of him with the words ""I am always with you"" written in capitals beneath his image, which she placed above her dressing table. He gave her a hand counter and told her to click it every time she thought of him. In one note, she said she was concerned she had not seen him for several days, and wrote: ""My hand tally counter is being well used!"" In another note, the words ""clickety x click!"" appeared next to hand-drawn flowers and the words ""I love you"". Miss Moore-Martin wrote Field a letter When Field wanted money, he lied about needing a new car and Miss Moore-Martin gave him Â£4,400. He told her his younger brother, Tom Field, was seriously ill with a kidney condition and needed a dialysis machine. It was another lie, but she was taken in and handed over Â£27,000. In a recording of a phone call played in court, Field was heard ringing her bank then handing her the phone so she could speak to the operator about releasing money from bonds. She told the bank: ""I'm thinking of withdrawing all the money held in my accountsâ¦ I have a very dear friend who is the brother of another dear friend. He's extremely ill, he's got kidney difficulties and is likely to die if he doesn't have his own dialysis machine and I've been thinking of a way in which I can help him."" She ended the call by saying: ""In life, one must not be selfish and keep everything to yourself."" This video can not be played Miss Moore-Martin told her bank ""one must not be selfish"" as she withdrew Â£27,000 in savings Field's deceit extended to writing messages on his deeply religious victim's mirror, in the hope she would believe they were messages from God. In his sketch books he planned the messages - how the writing would look, what the messages would say and what reasons there could be for them appearing.  Some of the messages told her to leave her house to Field. It worked and she changed her will. In February 2017, Miss Moore-Martin became ill and suffered a seizure. It was during her hospital stay she confided in her niece about her relationship with Field and the writing on the mirrors. The police became involved and an investigation started. Miss Moore-Martin reversed her will and changed it back to benefit her family and in May 2017 she died of natural causes in a care home. Her niece, Anne-Marie Blake, told the court that before she died her aunt had begun to realise she had been duped and could not believe she had been so stupid as to fall for Field's lies. ""She was tortured by it and found it very difficult to get her head around the betrayal,"" she said. Field left messages ""from God"" for Miss Moore-Martin as part of his campaign to get her to make him the beneficiary of her will Mrs Blake said when she met Field at her aunt's house after her hospital admission, she thought his manner was ""weird"". She challenged him and asked if he had been taking things from her aunt's home, accepting money from her and trying to change her will. He said he had. She also asked him whether he was in love with her aunt to which he said ""yes"". During her stay in hospital, Field tried to visit her but he was denied access. The court heard he complained to the police and told the call operator: ""A friend of mine was admitted to hospital and when I called the hospital and tried to visit, security have said that I can't see her and for more information I need to contact the police. ""I was calling to see if I could find out anything or what had been said about me, what the situation was."" In court he admitted he had made the calls to see how much the police knew about him and whether he was in trouble. His barrister, David Jeremy QC, asked him what had been the purpose of the call, and he replied: ""To find out if my fraud was rumbled or not."" The police investigation established the link between Field, Miss Moore-Martin and Mr Farquhar and 19 months after the latter's death a decision was taken to exhume his body. A second post-mortem examination established he had consumed less alcohol than had been thought and there were sedatives in his system. Ann Moore-Martin was ""like a love-struck teenager"" around Field, according to her niece Dr Brett Lockyer, a consultant forensic pathologist, said Mr Farquhar died as a result of the combined effects of alcohol and flurazepam, which could have affected his breathing. He said he could not rule out that Mr Farquhar might also been smothered with a pillow. The pathologist said a toxicological analysis showed Mr Farquhar had been repeatedly exposed to lorazepam in the two months before he died, as well as other sedatives. Field was arrested and his home was searched, where police found diaries and notebooks containing a list of people's names with the title,100 Clients. It was described by Field in court as a list of ""people who may be useful to me, either as targets of fraud or in other ways"". Members of his own family were listed - and so was Miss Moore-Martin. Books about poisoning people and planning a suicide were also discovered. Principal investigator Mr Glover said: ""[Field] got massive pleasure from other people's misery and pain and it was all about financial gain or gain in some shape or form to Ben Field. [He was] a nasty, cruel man."" Although he denied planning to kill the two neighbours he did admit to being in fraudulent relationships with them as part of a plot to get them to change their wills. Field also pleaded guilty to defrauding Miss Moore-Martin out of money he said was for a car and a dialysis machine, but was acquitted of conspiring to kill her. He stood trial alongside his friend, magician Martyn Smith, 32, from Redruth in Cornwall, who was accused of murder, conspiracy to murder, fraud and burglary. He was acquitted of all the charges. Field's younger brother, Tom Field, 24, from Olney, was also acquitted of one count of fraud. Ben Field is now facing a life sentence, but his early confidence that he would ""get away with most of it"" - secretly recorded while he sat in a police van - was not entirely misplaced. ""In terms of the death of Peter Farquhar, there's a very good chance that Benjamin Field would have got away with that death had it not been for the suspicions that were raised once Ann Moore-Martin was removed from Benjamin's control,"" said Chris Derrick, of the Crown Prosecution Service. ""In fact, at that stage he had already gotten away with it - it was only due to the new forensics that came from exhuming the body that we were able to build a case that indicated Benjamin Field had in fact killed Peter.""

"Jeremy Corbyn has urged the UK's most senior civil servant to intervene to prevent a no-deal Brexit happening during a general election campaign. The Labour leader is concerned that the UK could leave the EU on 31 October, while a campaign is ongoing and before a new government is elected. He has written to Cabinet Secretary Sir Mark Sedwill saying such a move would be an ""anti-democratic abuse of power"". It comes amid speculation MPs will table a no-confidence motion in the PM. It is thought opposition MPs could propose the vote in a bid to prevent the UK leaving the EU with no deal - leading to a general election being called. Mr Johnson has a working majority in Parliament of just one. What is a vote of no confidence? Still time to stop no-deal, Tory Brexit rebel says Do MPs have the power to stop a no-deal Brexit? Is it too late to hold an election before Brexit? The UK will leave the EU on 31 October with or without a deal unless Article 50 is extended or revoked. Mr Corbyn said his party would propose a no-confidence vote at an ""appropriate"" time after the Commons returned from its summer recess on 3 September. Election rules say Parliament should be dissolved 25 working days before polling day - so some people are concerned Mr Johnson could allow a no-deal Brexit to happen while MPs are not sitting. Speaking on Friday, Chancellor Sajid Javid told the BBC: ""I'm not speculating on votes of no confidence"". He added that the next general election should take place in 2022 - when it is currently scheduled to take place under UK law. If the PM loses the motion of no-confidence, then under the Fixed Term Parliaments Act he would have another 14 days to win a vote of confidence. If he failed to win such a vote, then a general election would be called on a date advised on by the PM. However, if another candidate could secure the confidence of the Commons, Mr Johnson would be expected to resign and recommend the Queen appoint that person in his place. This could in theory lead to atemporary cross-party government, whose main aim could be to request an extension from the EU and organise an election in the meantime. Lib Dem business spokesman Chuka Umunna said his party was willing to discuss with other parties how a no-deal Brexit might be avoided. However he said it ""isn't a runner"" to expect that Mr Corbyn could lead an interim administration, predicting he would fail to muster the required number of MPs to support him. ""He cannot command a majority among his own MPs, never mind others like Conservative rebels,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""Labour's priority is a Labour government, it isn't to stop Brexit,"" he added. The make-up of the House of Commons On Thursday, Mr Johnson was asked whether he would resign if he lost a no-confidence vote. He responded that MPs should ""honour the mandate of the people "" by leaving the EU. Mr Johnson's senior adviser, Dominic Cummings, has reportedly told MPs that losing a no-confidence vote would not stop the prime minister taking the UK out of the EU by the October 31 deadline. The Sunday Telegraph,externalreported that he said Mr Johnson could call an election to fall after 31 October, by which time Britain would have left. Brexiteers say Britain's departure from the EU is already set, with Parliament having consented to Brexit when it triggered negotiations under Article 50 and passed legislation thereafter to set the deadline of 31 October. A senior Conservative source accused Jeremy Corbyn of wanting to ignore the result of the 2016 referendum. ""No amount of letter-writing political stunts will change the fact that politicians don't get to choose which public votes they respect,"" the source added. This video can not be played No-deal Brexit: How might it affect the EU? Meanwhile, the government has announced aone-year spending reviewto give government departments ""financial certainty"" as they prepare for Brexit. Chancellor Sajid Javid said a ""fast-tracked"" spending round for 2020-21 would ""clear the ground ahead of Brexit while delivering on people's priorities"". In hisletter to Sir Mark,external, Mr Corbyn called the possibility of calling a general election to fall after Brexit had happened ""unprecedented"" and ""unconstitutional"". He referred to the Cabinet Office's election ""purdah"" guidance - which states that policy decisions on which a new government ""might be expected to want to take a different view"" should be postponed until after the election. Mr Corbyn added that a Labour government would never support a no-deal Brexit, and so would ""want the opportunity to take a different view"". He called on Sir Mark to rule that if the UK was due to leave the EU with no deal during an election, the government should seek another time-limited extension to Article 50. ""Forcing through no-deal against a decision of Parliament, and denying the choice to the voters in a general election already under way, would be an unprecedented, unconstitutional and anti-democratic abuse of power by a prime minister elected not by the public but by a small number of unrepresentative Conservative Party members,"" he wrote. A Cabinet Office spokeswoman said Sir Mark would respond to Mr Corbyn's letter ""in due course"". By Peter Saull, political correspondent In the period before elections there are restrictions on what civil servants can and can't do. The idea is to stop what is, effectively, a caretaker government from implementing decisions that the next government might disagree with. Downing Street would probably argue that those rules don't apply to Brexit. The UK's withdrawal from the EU has been the legal default since MPs voted to trigger Article 50 in March 2017. Nevertheless, purdah rules could limit the government's ability to make last-minute preparations for a no-deal departure.

"This video can not be played Magdalena's plea for her detained father: ""Let my dad be free like everybody else please."" US immigration officials say they have temporarily released about 300 people who were arrested in a massive raid in Mississippi on Wednesday. Democrats and rights groups have condemned the arrests as ""cruel"". Nearly 700 workers from seven agricultural processing plants were arrested for allegedly not having proper documentation to be in the US. Pictures emerged of children crying after being separated from their parents. Officials say they took steps to ensure any children were properly cared for. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) said ""approximately 680 removable aliens"" had been detained during the operation, which saw agents arriving in buses to question and arrest workers at the plants. President Donald Trump hadannounced an immigration crackdown in June,external, saying ""millions of illegal aliens who [had] found their way into the US"" would be removed. ICE spokesman Bryan Cox told the BBC that, of the 680 people arrested in Wednesday's raids, more than 300 had been released with notices to appear before immigration judges. ""They were placed into proceedings before the federal immigration courts and will have their day in court at a later date,"" he said in an emailed statement. Those who were not released will be moved to an ICE detention facility and held there, Mr Cox said. About 30 of the people detained were released on humanitarian grounds, theUS Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Mississippi said,external. Mr Cox said those arrested were asked if they had any dependents needing care or if they had any children at school who needed to be picked up. They were given access to phones at the processing site to make arrangements to care for their children. He said those with childcare issues were ""expeditiously processed and returned"". What's the state of illegal immigration in US? Six surprising statistics about immigrants in the US In response to critics who called the raids cruel and harmful to the workers' children, Mr Cox said the agency had directed two Homeland Security Investigations employees to notify schools of the operation and provide contact details for any children whose parents did not pick them up. ""This agency took extensive steps in planning for this operation to take special care of situations involving adults who may have childcare situations or children at school at the time of their arrest."" Those detained had been taken to a Mississippi National Guard hangar for questioning. ICE did not share details about the nationalities of those detained, but the Mexican government has reportedly sent consular staff to the area to help any of their nationals who may be involved. The raids took place just hours beforeMr Trump arrived in the majority Latino city of El Paso to mark a mass shootingwhich left 22 people dead. About 600 ICE agents arrived at the chicken processing plants, owned by five different companies, in the towns of Bay Springs, Canton, Carthage, Morton, Pelahatchie and Sebastopol. Friends and family looked on as officers surrounded plants and began to arrest the workers. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Nora Preciado, a supervising attorney at the National Immigration Law Center (NILC), told the BBC that, in many workplace raids, ""ICE often singles out people in a discriminatory fashion by focusing only on the Latino workers, and there are many incidents of excessive force during the detention and arrests"". ""These raids are rife with constitutional rights' violations, including agents having no legal authority to detain or arrest workers based solely on immigration status without probable cause,"" she said. ""Generally, regardless of whether released or not, anyone unauthorised will be put into deportation proceedings."" In the Mississippi raids, officials said they executed federal criminal and administrative search warrants for the arrested individuals. Some children were taken to a local gym after they came home to find their parents gone. Inone video posted on Facebook,externalfrom the Koch Foods plant in Morton, a young girl can be heard weeping uncontrollably as bystanders watch people being loaded on to a bus. An officer allows her to see her mother, who is the girl's only legal guardian, before the buses leave. Because the young girl is a US citizen, her mother will not be deported, the officer says. According to the Washington Post, the girl's mother had not been released as of Wednesday night. The effects of a US migrant raid on one tiny town Ms Preciado of the NILC said research shows raids like this have a ""harmful impact on safety, educational success, social and behavioural well-being and overall health of children in immigrant families"".

"Malaysia has charged 17 former and current Goldman Sachs bankers - including Richard Gnodde, the most senior banker in London - over the corruption investigation at its state development fund 1MDB. Attorney General Tommy Thomas said custodial sentences and criminal fines would be sought against those charged. Goldman helped raise $6.5bn (Â£5.4bn) through bond offerings for 1MDB. The bank said it would ""vigorously"" defend the charges. Mr Thomassaid in a statement,external: ""Custodial sentences and criminal fines will be sought against the accused."" He said this was because of the ""severity of the scheme to defraud and fraudulent misappropriation of billions in bond proceeds, the lengthy period over which the offences were planned and executed, the number of Goldman Sachs subsidiaries, officers and employers involved and the relative value of the fees and commissions paid to Goldman Sachs for their multiple roles played in arranging, structuring, underwriting and selling the three bonds"". If convicted, those charged could face prison sentences of up to 10 years and fines of at least one million ringgit (Â£200,000). In December last year, Malaysia filed criminal charges against Goldman Sachs and two former employees in connection with the corruption and money-laundering investigation at the fund, which is being investigated in at least six countries. 1MDB: Malaysia charges Goldman Sachs and two bankers 1MDB: Malaysia's global corruption scandal 1MDB scandal: The playboys, PMs and partygoers ""We believe the charges announced today, along with those against three Goldman Sachs entities announced in December last year, are misdirected and will be vigorously defended,"" a spokesperson for Goldman said. Among the other individuals named by Malaysia's attorney general are Michael Sherwood, a former co-head of Goldman's European operations, and Michael Evans, a former partner who is now president of Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba. The charges related to what is being seen as one of the world's biggest financial scandals. US and Malaysian prosecutors have previously said that the money raised by the state fund went to line the pockets of a few powerful individuals and to buy luxury properties, a private jet, Van Gogh and Monet artworks - and to finance a Hollywood blockbuster, The Wolf of Wall Street, starring Leonardo DiCaprio, who has not been accused of any wrongdoing Actor Leonardo DiCaprio with Jho Low (right) These charges have been brought under the under a section of the Malaysian Capital Markets and Services Act that holds certain senior executives responsible for any offences that may have been committed. In December, Malaysia filed charges against Goldman Sachs and its former bankers, Tim Leissner and Roger Ng. Mr Leissner was Goldman's South East Asia chairman, and left the bank in 2016. Mr Ng was a managing director at Goldman until his departure in May 2014. At the time, charges were also filed against local financier Low Taek Jho, also known as Jho Low who maintains his innocence, and former 1MDB employee Jasmine Loo Ai Swan. Mr Leissner has pleaded guilty in the US to conspiring to launder money and violating anti-bribery laws. The 1MDB state fund was set up by former Prime Minister Najib Razak in 2009. He has been accusing of pocketing $681m (Â£522m) from the sovereign wealth fund andpleaded not guilty in April. 1MDB scandal: The playboys, PMs and partygoers Goldman's role in the 1MDB scandal in 300 words Goldman boss apologises for 1MDB scandal Los Angeles mayor giving update on wildfires as more residents told to evacuate What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

"The feud comes as demonstrators gathered at Hong Kong's airport for the first of three days of protests The US has called China a ""thuggish regime"" after a Chinese state newspaper published the name and photo of a US diplomat talking to activists. China dismissed the remark as what it called ""gangster logic"". The Chinese have repeatedly accused the US of interfering in Hong Kong. The exchange came amid fresh demonstrations in Hong Kong, where protesters gathered at the airport. They waved protest banners at arrivers to raise international awareness. Hong Kong has seen weeks of demonstrations, sparked by anger at a proposed extradition bill between the former British colony and mainland China and evolving into demands for greater freedoms. How weeks of protests have hit Hong Kong tourism Hong Kong protesters turn to Uber and Pokemon The background you need on the Hong Kong protests Hong Kong is part of China but its citizens have more autonomy than those on the mainland. It has a free press and judicial independence under the so-called ""one country, two systems"" approach - freedoms activists fear are being increasingly eroded. They have called for an independent inquiry into alleged police brutality during the protests, the complete withdrawal of the controversial extradition bill, and the resignation of Hong Kong's leader Carrie Lam. On Thursday, China asked the US to explain reports its diplomats were in contact with Hong Kong protest leaders. Ta Kung Pao newspaper - a pro-Beijing publication - had published a photo of US diplomat Julie Eadeh meeting student leaders at a hotel, under the headline ""Foreign Forces Intervene"". China has repeatedly accused the US of meddling in Hong Kong's recent political crisis. Hong Kong activists have waved US and UK flags at protests The US rejected the accusation, saying its diplomats meet wide a range of people - including from the government and from businesses - and criticised the report. ""I don't think that is a formal protest, that is what a thuggish regime would do,"" spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus told reporters, adding it was ""not how a responsible nation would behave"". China in turn has dismissed ""gangster logic"" from the US, and said the country should stop interfering in its affairs. The feud comes as demonstrators gathered at Hong Kong airport for three days of protests. Activists waved banners written in different languages denouncing Carrie Lam and the police, and handed out leaflets with artwork explaining the recent protests. Allow Twitter content?

A demonstration at the airport on 26 July with thousands of Hong Kongers - including flight staff - took place without violence. China's Civil Aviation Administration (CAAC) on Friday ordered the Hong Kong-based airline Cathay Pacific to suspend all crew members deemed to have participated in the protests in Hong Kong. The CAAC told Cathay to submit all crew members' details to its officials for inspection and approval before flights were allowed to fly into or over mainland China airspace.

""We've experienced Sars and financial crises,"" Ms Lam told reporters after the meeting, referring to the respiratory disease epidemic in 2003. ""This time is more serious."" Property developers in the territory had earlier warned that demonstrations were damaging Hong Kong's economy. Ms Lam spoke to reporters after a meeting with business leaders ""Hong Kong cannot be in chaos. I believe this is the heartfelt opinion of all Hong Kongers,"" she said. ""We don't want such a cherished place to become like this."" She also announced the Hong Kong government would reconvene a week earlier than planned from summer recess on 13 August. But she refused to offer concessions to protesters, accusing a ""small minority of people"" of wanting to destroy the economy and of having ""no stake in the society which so many people have helped to build"". ""If you are unsatisfied with the Hong Kong government that does not mean you should condone the violence,"" she said. ""We hope to do our work better."" Young and unhappy in Hong Kong Beijing's struggle to win Hong Kong's young hearts Earlier on Friday, authorities confirmed that former deputy police commissioner Alan Lau has been brought out of retirement to help handle protests in the territory. The commander previously oversaw Hong Kong's pro-democracy rallies in 2014. Beijing has issued increasingly stern warnings about the continuing demonstrations, and the military recently released a video showing them conducting anti-riot drills. This video can not be played The video shows a soldier using a loudspeaker to warn protesters The footage - believed to have been filmed in the territory - shows heavily armed troops descending from helicopters and shooting their way through the streets and into people's homes. Demonstrations began in opposition to a proposed extradition bill, which would have allowed suspected criminals to be sent to mainland China for trial. Critics said it would undermine Hong Kong's legal freedoms, and could be used to silence critics. Police were then accused of using excessive force against protesters. Even though Hong Kong authorities agreed to suspend the bill, demonstrations continued, with calls for it to be fully withdrawn and for an independent investigation into police actions.

"Benjamin Field (right) has been convicted of the murder of Peter Farquhar A churchwarden has been found guilty of murdering an author after tricking him into changing his will. Benjamin Field, 28, manipulated 69-year-old Peter Farquhar for financial gain and tried to make his death look like an accident or suicide. Field was also accused of plotting to kill Mr Farquhar's neighbour Ann Moore-Martin, 83, in the village of Maids Moreton but was found not guilty. He was remanded in custody and will be sentenced at a date to be fixed. At Oxford Crown Court, Field was also acquitted of the attempted murder of Miss Moore-Martin. Mr Farquhar died in the Buckinghamshire village in October 2015, while Miss Moore-Martin, who lived three doors away, died in May 2017 from natural causes. The killer who believed he would 'get away with it' Field, a Baptist minister's son, admitted duping both Mr Farquhar and Miss Moore-Martin into fake relationships with him as part of a plot to get them to change their wills, but denied any involvement in their deaths. The court heard Field had undergone a ""betrothal"" ceremony with Mr Farquhar and was in a sexual relationship with Miss Moore-Martin. Prosecutor Oliver Saxby QC told the trial Field carried out a sustained ""gaslighting"" plot aimed at making Mr Farquhar question his sanity. Mr Farquhar's drinks were topped up with bioethanol and poteen, a high strength Irish alcohol, and his food was laced with drugs, Mr Saxby said. Mr Farquhar, who taught part-time at the University of Buckingham and had three novels published, suffered night terrors and hallucinations which he recorded in a handwritten journal. His third novel A Wide Wide Sea, published in 2015, was dedicated to Field, who delivered the eulogy at his funeral. Field said he drugged Mr Farquhar ""purely out of meanness"" Field's co-accused Martyn Smith, 32, of Penhalvean, Redruth, Cornwall, was cleared of murdering Mr Farquhar, plotting to kill Miss Moore-Martin, fraud and burglary. Speaking afterwards, he said: ""I am relieved that this ordeal is finally over...The lessons I take from this case are first and foremost to always be your own person and secondly to always choose your friends very carefully."" During the trial Field admitted drugging Mr Farquhar with benzodiazepines and hallucinogenic legal highs to ""torment"" him. He told the jury he did it ""for no other reason other than it was cruel, to upset and torment Peter - purely out of meanness"". But prosecutors said Field had a ""profound fascination in controlling and manipulating and humiliating and killing"". After Mr Farquhar changed his will three times in two years to benefit Field, he ""had to die"", Mr Saxby said. The court heard Field ""suffocated him"" when he was too weak to resist, and left a half-empty bottle of whisky in Mr Farquhar's room to create the misconception he had drunk himself to death. In a statement read by police, Mr Farquhar's brother Ian said: ""[Field's] actions have been unbelievably callous, and he has told lie after lie after lie in order to achieve his goals, deceiving everyone he met."" Senior investigating officer Mark Glover described Field as ""cruel, calculating, manipulative, deceitful"", adding: ""I don't think evil is too strong a word for him."" Chris Derrick, from the Crown Prosecution Service, said: ""He is clearly a very calculating and ruthless man who spent a great deal of time planning what he was going to do."" After the verdicts, journalist Michael Crick, who was taught by Mr Farquhar at Manchester Grammar School,tweeted,external: ""It's so dreadful to think my dear friend and teacher Peter Farquhar was murdered in such an awful way by a man he loved and trusted so much."" Another former pupil of the school, David Scheinmann, directed 2013 film Believe and has said a headmaster character, played by Toby Stevens, was in part based on Mr Farquhar. Mr Farquhar would often fall over after being drugged by Field Miss Moore-Martin's niece Ann-Marie Blake paid tribute to her aunt, who she described as ""a kind, gentle, beautiful soul, who touched so many lives, leaving behind a legacy of wonderful memories"". Judge Mr Justice Sweeney said it had been a ""challenging case"" for the jury, which took 77 hours to reach its verdict. He remanded Field, of Wellingborough Road, Olney, in custody until sentencing at a date to be fixed and ordered a psychiatric report. Field previously admitted four charges of fraud and two of burglary. His brother Tom Field, 24, of the same address, was cleared of a single charge of fraud.

"A Scottish sweet manufacturer is seeing sales of its fudge and toffee surge in Iraq. What's feeding that growing popularity? In northern Iraq, shops are rushing to fill their shelves with sweets. The Islamic holiday ofEid al-Adha, or Festival of the Sacrifice, is approaching - and it is an important part of the year for confectionery businesses. In Iraqi Kurdistan, as elsewhere, the four-day festival which starts on Sunday is a time for celebration and feasting - and sweets are very much on the menu. That's good news for Sulaymaniyah-based businessman Farhad Haseb, who sells confectionery to upmarket stores in Erbil and Dohuk, as well as other towns and cities in the region. Sweets are particularly popular during Eid in Iraqi Kurdistan ""In our culture, everyone buys very sweet things to give to their guests when they are visiting their homes,"" he says. ""Toffee is a very popular choice for Kurdish people, especially at Ramadan and Eid."" Iraqi Kurdistan profile What is Eid al-Adha? And families across Iraqi Kurdistan will be tucking into sweets that have been made 2,600 miles away in Scotland. Greenock-based confectioner Golden Casket, which is probably best known in the UK for its Millions brand, is one of Mr Haseb's main international suppliers. He first linked up with the Scottish company several years ago at a confectionery trade show, and has been ordering increasing amounts of its Halal-certified fudge, chocolate eclairs and assorted toffees each year. This video can not be played Master craftsman Paul Dooley works on the Golden Casket fudge production line Iraq is now Golden Casket's third biggest export market, after America and Ireland. The family-owned firm produces about 70 tonnes of toffees, boilings, fudges, chocolates and chews a week. So far this year, it has sent more than 60 tonnes of its Buchanan's brand sweets to the region. So what's behind the success of Scottish toffee in Iraqi Kurdistan? ""In our culture, eclairs and butter toffees are very popular,"" says Mr Haseb. ""We buy them from Belgium and Poland but Scottish toffee is the best - it is more chewy. We are selling more and more each year."" Mr Haseb, whose company Arak Garden imports more than 200 tonnes of toffee and chocolate a year, expects to place more orders with Golden Casket this year. The Scottish company, which is also known in the UK for its ""One Pounders"" bags, has been making adjustments to cater for the growing Iraqi market. It recently installed new machinery to boost its chocolate eclair production capacity. The company has also been paying close attention to the packaging of products for the Iraqi market. Sales manager Stuart Rae explains: ""Each jar of toffee or fudge has got to be gold wrapped - gold being a sign of quality - and it has to be made in the UK. ""That's the high-end stuff for the Kurdish market in Iraq."" Golden Casket's managing director Crawford Rae, who is also chairman of Greenock Morton Football Club, sees Iraq and the surrounding region as a ""great opportunity"". He says: ""We exhibited in Dubai for the first time in November - that's an emerging market and one that we want to break into, and export is certainly a growth potential for us."" The Kurdish link is a welcome one for Golden Casket, especially as the general confectionery market in the UK remains relatively flat at the moment. Muslims in Erbil celebrating Eid Al-Adha However, Golden Casket is not the only Scottish food and drink firm to identify Iraq as a potentially lucrative market. Earlier this year, Tunnock's - which has been exporting to the Middle East for more than 50 years - sent its first shipment of Caramel Wafers and Caramel Logs to the country. Sales director Fergus Loudon said: ""Iraq is a relatively new market for Tunnock's. The initial feedback has been very positive, with the distributor there ready to place the next order. ""It's obviously an emerging market, but we hope that some day soon Tunnock's biscuits will be as popular in Iraq as they are in other countries across the Middle East.""

"An independent review into fears of contamination at a school campus in North Lanarkshire has said that the schools are safe. The report,externalsaid there was no link between Buchanan and St Ambrose high schools in Coatbridge and ill health. It also said water samples passed drinking water standards and soil samples were ""not of concern"". But the report did criticise North Lanarkshire Council for its ""slow and defensive response"" to the fears. One parent told BBC Scotland that despite the findings, she was still not satisfied and would not be sending her children to St Ambrose School when it reopens next week. Parents and pupils joined teachers on the picket line at Buchanan High School before the summer holidays The campus was built on a landfill site that contained lead and arsenic. As part of the review, water, soil and air samples from the former landfill site were assessed, along with the integrity of the methane membrane, which was installed as a safety measure during construction of the campus. The review team found that one soil sample on the periphery of the site had elevated levels of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) - a chemical subject to an international industrial ban. They recommend that North Lanarkshire Council completes a full and independently verified removal of the chemical as soon as possible as a precaution. Other findings included: Parents and teachers were right to raise concerns North Lanarkshire Council and NHS Lanarkshire's reactions were too slow and too defensive There is no link between hazards at the site and ill health The risk from hazardous contaminants in the soil is very low Recommendations: To address elevated levels of PCBs from a peripheral part of the site Take more water samples in the coming months to address minor quality issues Set up a site recovery group to enable information to be shared and concerns to be raised Periodic testing results for the methane membrane to be made public as soon as possible Public health consultant Dr Margaret Hannah, who co-led the review, said: ""Many people were concerned about possible health risks from the previous use of the campus site. We listened carefully to the concerns of parents and teachers and worked with various experts in their field to determine the areas to test within the campus. ""Our principal finding is that the schools are safe, the site is safe and there is no link between the school and the reported health issues. However, we have made recommendations for some work to be carried out in order to provide further public reassurance."" Dr Margaret Hannah spoke to parents at the school One of the group's recommendations is to create a site recovery group that will enable information to be shared and concerns to be raised. ""Working together is key to restoring public confidence and we hope our findings will help all the communities in Coatbridge and beyond work towards common goals and in the best interests of the pupils and staff,"" Dr Hannah said. Deputy First Minister John Swinney said the report - commissioned by the Scottish government - ""provided reassurance"" to parents, pupils and staff. But he added: ""The review also finds, however, that North Lanarkshire Council and NHS Lanarkshire did not handle this issue at all well. They did not engage with parents sufficiently early or in an inclusive manner. ""The recommendations will ensure statutory bodies engage far more proactively with parents, staff and pupils to rebuild the trust and learn lessons from this for the future."" This video can not be played Lisa McCormick says she has ""no trust or faith"" in North Lanarkshire Council However, parent Lisa McCormick said she was ""still not satisfied"". ""I'm quite worried because of the short time the review team had,"" she said. ""Did that actually compromise their findings because they had such a tight timescale to do it all in? ""I'm not convinced 100%. My kids will still not be going back to the school. That comes down to North Lanarkshire Council's behaviour. I've got no trust or faith in them whatsoever. ""That will never, ever, be repaired for me personally. We've got the information we need... I can walk away knowing that that school just isn't right for my children."" The EIS teaching union's general secretary Larry Flanagan said: ""Whilst we accept the majority of the inquiry's conclusions, it is clear that the concerns at these schools should have been treated very differently by North Lanarkshire Council. ""Its mishandling of the situation on several occasions has increased stress and anxiety levels amongst teachers, parents and pupils. ""It is essential that the council now works positively to rebuild trust with all members of the school communities."" Parents âin limboâ ahead of school review findings Water to be tested at health fear schools Teachers on strike at health fear campus Parents want new tests at 'sick' school On Thursday, 36 members of the NASUWT teaching unionthreatened to go on strike from the first day of the new termunless they were satisfied the site posed no risks. Acting general secretary Chris Keates said the report was now being examined but in the meantime the planned strike action remained in place for Monday. She said the union would keep the position under review. NASUWT members went on strike over health concerns in June Robert Steenson, executive director for enterprise and communities at North Lanarkshire Council, said: ""We are pleased that the independent review agrees with the council's position throughout, which is that the schools are safe and that there is no link between the schools and any serious illness."" He said the council would implement the recommendations, and accepted that concerns over blue water on the site could have been dealt with at an earlier stage. ""However, all pipework has now been replaced and water fully complies with drinking quality standards,"" he added. The schools are due to reopen to pupils next week. Gabe Docherty, director of public health at NHS Lanarkshire said: ""It's vital that school life returns to normal as soon as possible and this report provides the peace-of-mind to enable that to happen."" The two school buildings, along with Townhead Community Centre, opened in 2012 on a site that was used as landfill for industrial waste, including lead and arsenic, between 1945 and 1972. Steps were taken to make the grounds safe before the campus opened in 2012, including bringing in fresh top soil. But in March 2018, staff and students were given bottled water amid concerns about blue-tinted water coming from the taps. Tests revealed higher than recommended levels of copper. It was blamed on corrosion and the pipes have since been replaced. However, safety fears came to a head earlier this year after it emerged that four former or current members of staff at Buchanan High had been treated for cancer. North Lanarkshire Council and NHS Lanarkshire said specialists did not believe cancer - or any other serious illness - was caused by the schools or the site on which they were built. But it failed to allay the concerns of parents, pupils and staff and in June the Scottish government ordered an immediate review into health and safety at the campus. A number of parents withdrew their children from the school and some teachers went on strike, with the NASUWT calling for the schools to close early for summer. North Lanarkshire Councilhas long maintained that there is no evidenceto show that the schools and the wider campus was unsafe. And in June thelocal authority created a leaflet,externalto provide further information and reassurance to parents, staff and pupils.

"Doctors have warned that Scotland needs to increase spending on the NHS by up to Â£3bn a year to bring it into line with other similar EU countries. BMA Scotland has set out 20 proposals aimed at ""shaping the future of safe, sustainable hospital-based healthcare"". It blames a lack of investment for missed targets, staff shortages and low morale. The Scottish government said it would ""fully consider"" the issues raised in the report. BMA Scotland said the country must follow others such as Austria and Belgium which spend 10% of GDP on health. That compares to 8.4% in Scotland and would have meant an extra Â£2.6bn in funding for 2017/18 alone. The body's consultant committee chairman Simon Barker said current problems across the system could not be allowed to go on indefinitely ""without increasing risk and adverse consequences for patients"". He was speaking as the doctors' organisation set out its 20 proposals in three key areas: a collaborative and sustainably-funded structure a supportive culture and a valued workforce Mr Barker said: ""Things have become progressively worse for those delivering care. ""They are being asked to work in services with neither enough staff, nor enough money. ""Yet they are constantly being harried to deliver care within unrealistic timescales, in the face of growing demand, and in fear of making mistakes for which they will be blamed - rather than the wider shortfalls of the system. ""The result is morale is pretty much rock bottom - in particular amongst senior doctors. The refrain 'work smarter' is threadbare in a system that struggles to provide basic services from one day to the next."" He added: ""For the future of our hospitals and the people who depend on them, this simply has to change. ""If it doesn't, we can no longer expect hospitals to provide the kind of comprehensive care we have always relied on the them for. ""If we can fix the funding, we have then put forward a raft of proposals to secure a brighter future for the care provided in our hospitals."" The Scottish government has defended its record on health spending. In a statement it said: ""Like the BMA Scotland, we believe that partnership between the public, health boards, stakeholders and government is the key to quality health care, and particularly in delivering specialist services that meet the physical and mental health needs of patients. ""This year the Scottish government is investing more than Â£14bn in health and care services, maintaining our investment in public services despite UK government austerity. This report raises a number of important issues and we will fully consider them as we continue to work to support our NHS and care staff to provide vital care.""

"The cost of a cremation has risen above the rate of inflation since 2015 Families in parts of the UK are paying hundreds of pounds more to cremate loved ones than others, figures show. Cremation costs at council-run sites range from Â£392 to Â£960 and have risen by nearly a fifth since 2015. Experts said it was likely people in areas where charges were higher would have to pay, as grieving people tended not to shop around for a cheaper area. Council fees are mostly reinvested in cemeteries and crematoria, according to the Local Government Association. The BBC analysed figures for adult cremations, collected by charity The Cremation Society, and obtained the latest data for 183 council-run crematoria in the UK and Channel Islands for the past five years. Costs had risen in two thirds of areas since 2018 and, adjusting for inflation, prices were up by 11% on average since 2015. Between 2010 and 2015 cremation pricesrose by a thirdacross 170 local councils. The figures showed the cremation fee plus a medical referee's fee and any environmental surcharge. This represented the minimum cost charged by local authorities for services from 15 to 45 minutes but did not include additional funeral expenses. Karen Hitchman said she tried to shop around for a good deal, but still had to find financial help to cover funeral costs Karen Hitchman, 56, from Mossley in Greater Manchester, said when her parents died within six weeks of each other she had no savings to pay for their funerals. ""I actually felt suicidal, that's how depressed I got with it all and the more people I asked for help, the more I got turned away,"" she said. Ms Hitchman eventually received help from the government and charities but said funeral costs in general were too high for those already struggling to make ends meet. ""Obviously when you're in a state of shock and you're dealing with a funeral, it's the last thing you think of,"" she said. ""Afterwards when you sit down and think about it, it [is] extortionate. ""It's robbery, you can't afford to live, you can't afford to die,"" she said. The most expensive council-owned crematorium was in Milton Keynes, which currently charges Â£960 as a basic fee. However, private sector cremations could cost more, according to the Cremation Society, with a top price of Â£1,070. A spokesman for Milton Keynes Council said it set its prices to ensure the recovery of the costs in delivering the service. ""The charges cover the maintenance costs of the crematorium and 10 cemeteries across Milton Keynes,"" he said. According to the council this ensured the cremators were maintained ""at the standards required to achieve the most effective and efficient processes"". Barrow Borough Council said up to 2015 its fees were ""lower than many other crematoria"". ""With the reduction in government funding the borough council increased all fees in comparison with our neighbouring authorities,"" it said. Glynn Humphries, from Wakefield Council, said it had set its fees to cover the costs of replacing its cremators in recent years. ""It is important that we are equipped to meet future demand, as the death rate is likely to rise,"" he added. Belfast currently has the lowest cost for cremation at Â£364. A spokeswoman for Belfast City Council said its last detailed review of cremation costs was undertaken ""some years ago"" but current prices were ""subject to change"". Julie Dunk, chief executive of the Institute of Cemetery and Crematorium Management, said while a cremation ""can seem quite expensive"" when broken down, the costs made sense. ""There's quite a lot involved when it comes to cremation, not just the actual process itself but all the infrastructure around it,"" she said. ""So it may be that a crematorium has had to invest quite heavily in new equipment to meet environmental standards or to bring the chapels up to a decent level."" She added many public crematoria were now ""ageing buildings"" that required constant maintenance from local authorities running them. Commenting on the difference across the country in price, the Good Funeral Guide's Fran Hall said families in high cost areas would often just pay what was asked. ""It's very unlikely that people will ring three different crematoria to find the cheapest one to take grandma to when it's time for her funeral, that just doesn't happen,"" she said. She said there was a ""subliminal assumption"" shopping around for the cheapest deal meant families were not ""doing the right thing"" for the person who died. 'No frills' cremation to tackle funeral poverty Funeral director stages poverty march Roadworks 'losing crematorium business' Councillor Simon Blackburn, from the Local Government Association, said council fees generally accounted for ""less than a quarter"" of the overall cost of a cremation. ""There is no restriction on how surplus revenue is used but it is mostly reinvested in cemetery and crematoria infrastructure, grounds maintenance, staff and energy costs to address demand and provide the services bereaved families want."" In March the Competition and Markets Authority saidit would be launching an investigation,externalinto the funerals sector. It said ""problems"" with the market had led to above inflation price rises ""for well over a decade"" in both the funeral and crematoria services. ""The scale of these price rises does not currently appear to be justified by cost increases or quality improvements,"" a spokesman said.

"This video can not be played Magdalena's plea for her detained father: ""Let my dad be free like everybody else please."" US immigration officials say they have temporarily released about 300 people who were arrested in a massive raid in Mississippi on Wednesday. Democrats and rights groups have condemned the arrests as ""cruel"". Nearly 700 workers from seven agricultural processing plants were arrested for allegedly not having proper documentation to be in the US. Pictures emerged of children crying after being separated from their parents. Officials say they took steps to ensure any children were properly cared for. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) said ""approximately 680 removable aliens"" had been detained during the operation, which saw agents arriving in buses to question and arrest workers at the plants. President Donald Trump hadannounced an immigration crackdown in June,external, saying ""millions of illegal aliens who [had] found their way into the US"" would be removed. ICE spokesman Bryan Cox told the BBC that, of the 680 people arrested in Wednesday's raids, more than 300 had been released with notices to appear before immigration judges. ""They were placed into proceedings before the federal immigration courts and will have their day in court at a later date,"" he said in an emailed statement. Those who were not released will be moved to an ICE detention facility and held there, Mr Cox said. About 30 of the people detained were released on humanitarian grounds, theUS Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Mississippi said,external. Mr Cox said those arrested were asked if they had any dependents needing care or if they had any children at school who needed to be picked up. They were given access to phones at the processing site to make arrangements to care for their children. He said those with childcare issues were ""expeditiously processed and returned"". What's the state of illegal immigration in US? Six surprising statistics about immigrants in the US In response to critics who called the raids cruel and harmful to the workers' children, Mr Cox said the agency had directed two Homeland Security Investigations employees to notify schools of the operation and provide contact details for any children whose parents did not pick them up. ""This agency took extensive steps in planning for this operation to take special care of situations involving adults who may have childcare situations or children at school at the time of their arrest."" Those detained had been taken to a Mississippi National Guard hangar for questioning. ICE did not share details about the nationalities of those detained, but the Mexican government has reportedly sent consular staff to the area to help any of their nationals who may be involved. The raids took place just hours beforeMr Trump arrived in the majority Latino city of El Paso to mark a mass shootingwhich left 22 people dead. About 600 ICE agents arrived at the chicken processing plants, owned by five different companies, in the towns of Bay Springs, Canton, Carthage, Morton, Pelahatchie and Sebastopol. Friends and family looked on as officers surrounded plants and began to arrest the workers. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Nora Preciado, a supervising attorney at the National Immigration Law Center (NILC), told the BBC that, in many workplace raids, ""ICE often singles out people in a discriminatory fashion by focusing only on the Latino workers, and there are many incidents of excessive force during the detention and arrests"". ""These raids are rife with constitutional rights' violations, including agents having no legal authority to detain or arrest workers based solely on immigration status without probable cause,"" she said. ""Generally, regardless of whether released or not, anyone unauthorised will be put into deportation proceedings."" In the Mississippi raids, officials said they executed federal criminal and administrative search warrants for the arrested individuals. Some children were taken to a local gym after they came home to find their parents gone. Inone video posted on Facebook,externalfrom the Koch Foods plant in Morton, a young girl can be heard weeping uncontrollably as bystanders watch people being loaded on to a bus. An officer allows her to see her mother, who is the girl's only legal guardian, before the buses leave. Because the young girl is a US citizen, her mother will not be deported, the officer says. According to the Washington Post, the girl's mother had not been released as of Wednesday night.

"This video can not be played UK shouldn't be afraid of US farm exports, says former Trump adviser A former top trade adviser to US President Trump has told the BBC ""there is a level of panic"" around Brexit ""that is not justified"". Stephen Vaughn, who served as acting trade representative before becoming general counsel on trade, stressed the UK has ""enormous leverage"" in a potential trade deal with the US. On a deal's likelihood, he said the Trump administration is ""ready to go"". The UK will be able to strike its own trade deals only after leaving the EU. China exports rise despite simmering US trade row Trump escalates trade war with more China tariffs Tariffs backfiring on US, says ex-Trump adviser As a member of President Trump's negotiating team, Mr Vaughn had a key role in the talks with Canada and China, before leaving the administration in April. In reference to a potential UK deal, he compared the situation with US-Canada negotiations: ""No one would say, 'Canada has to join the US in a union or Canada will get steamrolled by the US'."" ""You have an enormous amount of leverage, and we'll see how you use it,"" he added, speaking in his first broadcast interview since leaving the Office of the US Trade Representative. On US preparations for a potential deal with the UK, he said that Robert Lighthizer, the current US Trade Representative, had done all the preparations needed. However, he acknowledged that agreeing a deal could take ""months or years"". The US Trade Representative, sometimes shortened to USTR, is the president's top adviser on international trade. The team negotiates directly with foreign governments to create trade agreements and participate in global trade policy organisations. Concerns have been raised over the impact of a deal on life in the UK, including whether US drugmakers would demand the ability to sell to the NHS. Another key export for the US is agricultural products, but the fact farming methods in the US don't fall under the EU regulations has led some toworry about food standards. Could Boris Johnson and Donald Trump agree a trade deal together? Mr Vaughn emphasised that the US would like a deal to involve the expansion of farm exports, saying he doesn't think it's ""something people should be afraid of"". The trade expert, who now works in the private sector, also played an active role in the Trump administration'strade war with China. He said that a key aspect of those talks was to make sure the two sides comprehended each other: ""You really just want to make sure everybody is understanding the issues and what is at stake."" He added that the talks are very ""serious"" and there is no ""yelling and screaming"". Mr Vaughn stressed that the US is concerned about various Chinese practices and that it wants to see Chinese businesses become more ""market-oriented"". He went on to defend the use oftariffs against China: ""You're trying to figure out, how do you get leverage on the other people?"", he explained, adding that Mr Trump is not satisfied with the status quo he inherited. On the impact of tariffs, he rejected the idea that the measures may be having a negative effect on US business. ""When you look at the actual data, we have by far the largest economy in the G7 and our manufacturing sector continues to grow,"" he argued. US business groups have called for a rethink on tariffs, including the National Retail Federation, which has complained about the administration ""doubling down on a flawed tariff strategy"". The former top adviser to President Trump, Gary Cohn, has also warned that the tariffs are backfiring. Speaking in an earlierinterview with the BBC, Mr Cohn criticised the approach the Trump administration is taking against China, saying: ""I think everyone loses in a trade war."" Mr Cohn, who served as director of the National Economic Council in the Trump administration, announcing he was resigning after Mr Trump decided to impose import tariffs on steel and aluminium. Mr Vaughn became the acting USTR on Trump's inauguration day in January 2017, staying on until Mr Lighthizer was confirmed in May 2017. He served as Mr Lighthizer's general counsel until the end of April 2019. Before entering the White House, he was a partner at US law firm King & Spalding, a role to which he has returned.

"Chancellor Sajid Javid has announced a one-year spending review to give government departments ""financial certainty"" as they prepare for Brexit. Mr Javid said a spending round for 2020-21 would ""clear the ground ahead of Brexit while delivering on people's priorities"". He told the BBC that he was confident it would meet the government's priorities for the NHS, police and schools. It is not a multi-year spending review. Those usually happen every two to four years and due to Brexit delays there has not been such a review since 2015. The Institute for Fiscal Studies called it ""long-awaited"", while Labour said the Tories were ""playing dangerous games with spending"". What should we expect from new Chancellor Sajid Javid? Sajid Javid tells HMRC: Make no-deal Brexit planning top priority Â£2.1bn extra for no-deal Brexit planning Spending reviews are regularly carried out by the Treasury to fix firm expenditure limits and set out what the public can expect from the government. Mr Javid told the BBC: ""One of things I've done is I want to make sure all departments, including my own, are very focused on our priority which is to make sure we leave the European Union on October 31st. ""That's why I'm having a one-year spending round so we can just get focused on our priority. ""But I'm confident that in that spending round that we'll be able to meet all our priorities and that certainly means increased focus on the NHS, on police and on schools."" Mr Javid was appointed chancellor by incoming Prime Minister Boris Johnson last month, replacing Philip Hammond. Speaking after data showed the economy had contracted in the second quarter of the year, he added: ""I'll be a chancellor to make sure that our country continues to live within our means."" He also said the economy remained strong and was forecast to return to growth, meaning the government could ""continue to invest in the priorities of the British people"". Chief Secretary to the Treasury Rishi Sunak said: ""This spending round will give financial certainty to departments' plans for next year. ""We will invest in the priority areas of schools and policing, while delivering our promises on the NHS, defence and Official Development Assistance [foreign aid]."" Mr McDonnell said the approach ""smacks of pre-election panic"" Under Mr Johnson's administration, emergency preparations for a possible no-deal Brexit have been ramped up. Last week, Mr Javid announcedan extra Â£2.1bn of fundingto prepare for such an outcome - doubling the amount of money the government has set aside this year. Labour's Mr McDonnell said the approach ""smacks of pre-election panic measures by the government"". ""Boris Johnson is splashing a little bit of cash as a publicity stunt, but keeping the door open for even more austerity if a no-deal Brexit breaks the economy,"" he said. Mr McDonnell said there were ""gaping holes"" in the spending plans, with ""nowhere near enough"" allocated to the NHS, schools or local government. About 50% of government spending is planned on a multi-year basis, when it comes to things like public services, such as the NHS, schools or the police, which are unlikely to alter drastically from year to year. Typically, these budgets are set three or four years in advance, in order to help government departments plan their spending more effectively. Tony Bonsignore, political correspondent Government departments are likely to have mixed views about this announcement. On the one hand, some public services - for example, health and the police - may be offered more money. There may also be extra cash to deal with the potential fallout from a no-deal Brexit. The government says this decision is about getting Brexit done and delivering on people's priorities. But the decision also makes it harder for public services to plan for the longer term, as they'll now have to wait another year for the real spending review. There's also the risk that the spending taps might be turned off as quickly as they're turned on. That's Labour's line of attack - they're accusing the government of playing ""dangerous games"" and ""abandoning any pretence of a long-term economic plan"". ""If you're a head teacher or head of a police force, if you're trying to work out who to hire or whether to invest in a piece of equipment, it helps to know what your budget is going to be into the future,"" Ben Zaranko, a research economist with the Institute for Fiscal Studies, told the BBC. ""If you have to plan this on a year-to-year basis, it's quite hard."" This time, the spending review will be published in advance of the Budget, which means the chancellor will be making spending plans before he has updated forecasts for the economy, and before he has set tax policy, Mr Zaranko added. One-year spending reviews are not unprecedented. In 2013, the government set the budget for 2015-16, so as to avoid spending decisions going beyond the next election. Chancellor Sajid Javid and Home Secretary Priti Patel were given a tour of Tilbury Docks in early August The IFS's Mr Zaranko said it made sense that the chancellor was unwilling to commit to longer spending plans, because ""we don't know what the economy is going to look like six months down the line, let alone three years"". However, it would make it much harder for government departments to plan for the future. Earlier this year, Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Constabulary released a report warning that one-year spending reviews would not be good for the police in England. But James Jamieson, chairman of the Local Government Association, welcomed the one-year spending round, saying councils ""urgently need some certainty about how local services will be funded next year as they begin their budget-setting process"".

"This video can not be played Brexit has created ""cloudy skies"", says Zed Sheikh The chancellor has told the BBC that he does not expect the UK to slide into recession after data showed the economy shrank by 0.2% between April and June. Sajid Javid was speaking after the Office for National Statistics said the economy had contracted for the first time since 2012. The surprise decline came after Brexit stockpiles were unwound and the car industry implemented shutdowns. The pound sank after the data was released, raising fears of a recession. Against the dollar sterling fell to $1.2025. Against the euro, it dropped throughout the day to â¬1.0736, a level not seen since the global financial crisis a decade ago. Rob Kent-Smith, head of GDP at the ONS, said manufacturing output fell and the construction sector weakened. What is the UK's GDP? Bank of England cuts UK growth forecast A recession occurs when the economy contracts in two consecutive quarters. This is the first contraction since the fourth quarter of 2012. Economists had not been forecasting a contraction in the economy in the second quarter, but had expected it to stagnate, with the consensus forecast for 0% growth. The economyhad shown 0.5% growth in the first quarterafter manufacturers' stockpiling ahead of Brexit helped to boost output, when the manufacturing sector recorded its biggest quarter rise since the 1980s. The ONS said GDP had been ""particularly volatile"" so far this year because of the changes to activity sparked by the original Brexit date of 29 March. The statistics body said its latest figures showed that those increased stockpiles had been partly run down in the second quarter and that a number of car manufacturers had brought forward their annual shutdowns to April as part of contingency planning, which also hit growth. Mr Kent-Smith said: ""Manufacturing output fell back after a strong start to the year, with production brought forward ahead of the UK's original departure date from the EU."" He added that ""the often-dominant service sector delivered virtually no growth at all"". Mr Javid told the BBC: ""I am not expecting a recession at all. And in fact, don't take my word for it. There's not a single leading forecaster out there that is expecting a recession, the independent Bank of England is not expecting a recession. And that's because they know that the fundamentals remain strong."" The Bank said earlier this monthit expects the economy to grow by 1.3% this year, down from a previous projection of 1.5% in May. This video can not be played The Chancellor Sajid Javid said he was not expecting a recession Asked about the impact of Brexit, he said: ""We saw some significant stockpiling by British businesses in anticipation of the Brexit that never was, and now they're using those stockpiles, they're coming down. ""Of course, there are businesses out there that are taking Brexit into account when they're making decisions."" He said: ""No one will be surprised by today's figures."" The data comes at a time when there are signs other economies are slowing. For instance, data on Friday showed that French industrial output fell more than expected in June. Mr Javid said: ""This is a challenging period across the global economy, with growth slowing in many countries. ""But the fundamentals of the British economy are strong - wages are growing, employment is at a record high and we're forecast to grow faster than Germany, Italy and Japan this year."" But John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said the ""dismal economic figures are a direct result of Tory incompetence"". ""The Tories' Brexit bungling, including Boris Johnson now taking us towards no-deal, is breaking the economy."" The Liberal Democrats were also concerned about the impact of a no-deal Brexit. ""Pursuing a no-deal Brexit is a political choice without a mandate: these figures show people's jobs and livelihoods are being sacrificed at the altar of political extremism, "" said Chuka Umunna, the party's Treasury and business spokesperson. Mr Javid said the best way to deal with Brexit uncertainty was to leave the EU on 31 October, with or without a deal. ""We're seeing volatility in the figures and one of the best ways to actually end this volatility is to bring certainty around Brexit and make sure we leave on 31 October."" The employers' body, the CBI, said the contraction was ""concerning"". Alpesh Paleja, CBI lead economist, said: ""Growth has been pushed down by an unwind of stockpiling and car manufacturers shifting their seasonal shutdowns. The winding down of Brexit stockpiling was partly to blame for the weak growth ""Nonetheless, it's clear from our business surveys that underlying momentum remains lukewarm, choked by a combination of slower global growth and Brexit uncertainty. ""As a result, business sentiment is dire."" The Federation of Small Businesses - which is calling for an emergency Budget - said that if the Treasury delays action until after 31 October, the date for Brexit, its efforts are likely to prove too little, too late. ""Time is of the essence. Unless the chancellor steps in imminently with radical action, we could be heading for a chaotic autumn - and a very long winter,"" said the FSB's policy and advocacy chairman, Martin McTague. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, said the data showed ""an economy in decline and skirting with recession  as headwinds from slower global growth are exacerbated by a Brexit-related paralysis"". Geoffrey Yu of UBS Wealth Management said that while the global picture was ""becoming more gloomy"", anyone looking for positive signs for the economy could look to ""robust private consumption, reflecting a healthy labour market"". Household spending rose 0.5% on the quarter. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, agreed that household spending was still growing at a ""robust rate"" and said it was not time to panic. He said the stockpiling was dragging on the economy, which was ""sluggish and had not stalled"". The pound - which has been at two-year lows following Brexit uncertainty - fell after the data was released. The currency also falls if there are expectations that interest rates will be cut. Mr Tombs said the market now sees a 70% chance of an interest rate cut in January, when Mark Carney is due to leave as the Bank of England's governor. How fast is the UK's economy growing?

"Doctors have warned that Scotland needs to increase spending on the NHS by up to Â£3bn a year to bring it into line with other similar EU countries. BMA Scotland has set out 20 proposals aimed at ""shaping the future of safe, sustainable hospital-based healthcare"". It blames a lack of investment for missed targets, staff shortages and low morale. The Scottish government said it would ""fully consider"" the issues raised in the report. BMA Scotland said the country must follow others such as Austria and Belgium which spend 10% of GDP on health. That compares to 8.4% in Scotland and would have meant an extra Â£2.6bn in funding for 2017/18 alone. The body's consultant committee chairman Simon Barker said current problems across the system could not be allowed to go on indefinitely ""without increasing risk and adverse consequences for patients"". He was speaking as the doctors' organisation set out its 20 proposals in three key areas: a collaborative and sustainably-funded structure a supportive culture and a valued workforce Mr Barker said: ""Things have become progressively worse for those delivering care. ""They are being asked to work in services with neither enough staff, nor enough money. ""Yet they are constantly being harried to deliver care within unrealistic timescales, in the face of growing demand, and in fear of making mistakes for which they will be blamed - rather than the wider shortfalls of the system. ""The result is morale is pretty much rock bottom - in particular amongst senior doctors. The refrain 'work smarter' is threadbare in a system that struggles to provide basic services from one day to the next."" He added: ""For the future of our hospitals and the people who depend on them, this simply has to change. ""If it doesn't, we can no longer expect hospitals to provide the kind of comprehensive care we have always relied on the them for. ""If we can fix the funding, we have then put forward a raft of proposals to secure a brighter future for the care provided in our hospitals."" The Scottish government has defended its record on health spending. In a statement it said: ""Like the BMA Scotland, we believe that partnership between the public, health boards, stakeholders and government is the key to quality health care, and particularly in delivering specialist services that meet the physical and mental health needs of patients. ""This year the Scottish government is investing more than Â£14bn in health and care services, maintaining our investment in public services despite UK government austerity.

"A BBC Weather Watcher photographed flooding on a road in St Andrews Travellers in Scotland have been given a fresh warning that difficult weather conditions could continue for much of the weekend. The Met Office also issued a yellow warning for heavy showers and thunderstorms continuing until Sunday. Fifteen flood alerts have been put in place by the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (Sepa). Much of Scotland was already on alert as heavy rain lashed large parts of the country. Why is August Scotland's wettest summer month? Met Office chief meteorologist Neil Armstrong said: ""This low-pressure system will bring challenging conditions, including unseasonably strong winds and heavy rain, from the west during Friday and Saturday. ""Summer storms - compared with those in autumn and winter - always have the potential to create additional impacts because more people are likely to be outdoors, especially by the coast. ""Additionally, with trees in full leaf they are more vulnerable to being brought down by strong winds."" Katie Archibald prepares to lead her team out in Dundee One of the events affected by weather conditions was the Women's Tour of Scotland. Organisers of the cycling race, taking place for the first time, said the first stage - from Dundee to Dunfermline -had been abandoned due to ""extreme weather conditions"". Stage two - still scheduled for Saturday - is from Glasgow to Perth. Surface water caused difficulties for motorists on Friday and ferries were disrupted by high winds. Rail services between Fort William and Mallaig have been replaced by buses after a steam train hit a tree. And trains through Bishopton in Renfrewshire were cancelled for the remainder of the day after a tree fell on overhead wires at about 09:15. The loss of power to the overhead lines left about 200 passengers stranded on three trains in the area for about two hours. Three trains were brought to a halt near Bishopton A ""rescue train"" was brought in to remove those on board and they disembarked at Bishopton at 11:30. ScotRail said engineers were working to repair the ""significant damage"" affecting services between Glasgow Central and Gourock/Wemyss Bay. The disruption was expected to last into the weekend as the rail firm said the repair work would be completed by midday on Saturday. ""We're sorry to customers who've been affected by this, and share their frustrations,"" a spokesman added. ""To keep people moving, we're operating a shuttle service between Glasgow and Paisley, and customers can use their train tickets on selected local buses."" ScotRail said on Friday that services between Dunblane - Edinburgh and Glasgow Queen Street were running as normal after major disruption on Thursday. However, disruption to trains between Glasgow Queen Street and Crianlarich / Oban is expected until the end of Monday and the Highland Sleeper will not run between Edinburgh and Fort William, after the line was damaged by heavy rain. The line between Ardlui and Crainlarichwill not reopen until 22 August, Network Rail said. A number of routes in southern Scotland have been affected by fallen trees In Dumfries and Galloway a driver had a lucky escape after a tree fell on a car near Castle Douglas. Police said the motorist had walked away uninjured but a number of trees were down across the region. Transport Scotland said the heavy rain means saturated ground and areas already hit by flooding may be affected again. A spokesman said: ""This will cause challenging conditions for drivers and commuters, and we would again urge the public to check before they travel, follow police advice, and to drive to the conditions, where routes are passable. ""Planning is under way to prepare for the continued heavy rainfall to allow for early interventions, such as having pumps ready and available in an effort to avoid further closures at known sites. However, the sheer volume of rain does make this challenging."" Why is August Scotland's wettest summer month? Cyclist makes it through flood water in Edinburgh.

"Jeremy Corbyn has urged the UK's most senior civil servant to intervene to prevent a no-deal Brexit happening during a general election campaign. The Labour leader is concerned that the UK could leave the EU on 31 October, while a campaign is ongoing and before a new government is elected. He has written to Cabinet Secretary Sir Mark Sedwill saying such a move would be an ""anti-democratic abuse of power"". It comes amid speculation MPs will table a no-confidence motion in the PM. It is thought opposition MPs could propose the vote in a bid to prevent the UK leaving the EU with no deal - leading to a general election being called. Mr Johnson has a working majority in Parliament of just one. What is a vote of no confidence? Still time to stop no-deal, Tory Brexit rebel says Do MPs have the power to stop a no-deal Brexit? Is it too late to hold an election before Brexit? The UK will leave the EU on 31 October with or without a deal unless Article 50 is extended or revoked. Mr Corbyn said his party would propose a no-confidence vote at an ""appropriate"" time after the Commons returned from its summer recess on 3 September. Election rules say Parliament should be dissolved 25 working days before polling day - so some people are concerned Mr Johnson could allow a no-deal Brexit to happen while MPs are not sitting. Speaking on Friday, Chancellor Sajid Javid told the BBC: ""I'm not speculating on votes of no confidence"". He added that the next general election should take place in 2022 - when it is currently scheduled to take place under UK law. If the PM loses the motion of no-confidence, then under the Fixed Term Parliaments Act he would have another 14 days to win a vote of confidence. If he failed to win such a vote, then a general election would be called on a date advised on by the PM. However, if another candidate could secure the confidence of the Commons, Mr Johnson would be expected to resign and recommend the Queen appoint that person in his place. This could in theory lead to atemporary cross-party government, whose main aim could be to request an extension from the EU and organise an election in the meantime. Lib Dem business spokesman Chuka Umunna said his party was willing to discuss with other parties how a no-deal Brexit might be avoided. However he said it ""isn't a runner"" to expect that Mr Corbyn could lead an interim administration, predicting he would fail to muster the required number of MPs to support him. ""He cannot command a majority among his own MPs, never mind others like Conservative rebels,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""Labour's priority is a Labour government, it isn't to stop Brexit,"" he added. The make-up of the House of Commons On Thursday, Mr Johnson was asked whether he would resign if he lost a no-confidence vote. He responded that MPs should ""honour the mandate of the people "" by leaving the EU. Mr Johnson's senior adviser, Dominic Cummings, has reportedly told MPs that losing a no-confidence vote would not stop the prime minister taking the UK out of the EU by the October 31 deadline. The Sunday Telegraph,externalreported that he said Mr Johnson could call an election to fall after 31 October, by which time Britain would have left. Brexiteers say Britain's departure from the EU is already set, with Parliament having consented to Brexit when it triggered negotiations under Article 50 and passed legislation thereafter to set the deadline of 31 October. A senior Conservative source accused Jeremy Corbyn of wanting to ignore the result of the 2016 referendum. ""No amount of letter-writing political stunts will change the fact that politicians don't get to choose which public votes they respect,"" the source added. This video can not be played No-deal Brexit: How might it affect the EU? Meanwhile, the government has announced aone-year spending reviewto give government departments ""financial certainty"" as they prepare for Brexit. Chancellor Sajid Javid said a ""fast-tracked"" spending round for 2020-21 would ""clear the ground ahead of Brexit while delivering on people's priorities"". In hisletter to Sir Mark,external, Mr Corbyn called the possibility of calling a general election to fall after Brexit had happened ""unprecedented"" and ""unconstitutional"". He referred to the Cabinet Office's election ""purdah"" guidance - which states that policy decisions on which a new government ""might be expected to want to take a different view"" should be postponed until after the election. Mr Corbyn added that a Labour government would never support a no-deal Brexit, and so would ""want the opportunity to take a different view"". He called on Sir Mark to rule that if the UK was due to leave the EU with no deal during an election, the government should seek another time-limited extension to Article 50. ""Forcing through no-deal against a decision of Parliament, and denying the choice to the voters in a general election already under way, would be an unprecedented, unconstitutional and anti-democratic abuse of power by a prime minister elected not by the public but by a small number of unrepresentative Conservative Party members,"" he wrote. A Cabinet Office spokeswoman said Sir Mark would respond to Mr Corbyn's letter ""in due course"". By Peter Saull, political correspondent In the period before elections there are restrictions on what civil servants can and can't do. The idea is to stop what is, effectively, a caretaker government from implementing decisions that the next government might disagree with. Downing Street would probably argue that those rules don't apply to Brexit. The UK's withdrawal from the EU has been the legal default since MPs voted to trigger Article 50 in March 2017. Nevertheless, purdah rules could limit the government's ability to make last-minute preparations for a no-deal departure. Ministers would not, for example, be able to instruct civil servants to start a new public information campaign. Of course, all of this is uncharted territory and no-one knows for sure quite how it will all pan out. Can no-deal Brexit be stopped?

"Uber's shares went into reverse on Thursday after the taxi-hailing company unveiled profit figures that failed to live up to expectations. Revenue growth slowed in face of heavy competition, leading to the company posting its largest quarterly loss. Uber and its rivals are spending heavily to expand, but boss Dara Khosrowshahi said that the competitive pressures are easing. But that didn't stop Uber's share price tumbling 13% in after-hours trading. Is Uber really worth billions of dollars? Uber planning stock market flotation 'in April' Would you buy shares in Uber? On Wednesday, rival Lyft reported figures that were generally welcomed on Wall Street, and there was an expectation that Uber would also post positive numbers. But Uber's loss widened to $5.2bn (Â£4.3bn) in the three months to 30 June, from $878m in the quarter last year. The figures reflected $3.9bn of share-based compensation expenses related to its stock market listing earlier this year. Total revenue rose 14.4% to $3.2bn, but fell short of average analysts' estimates of $3.4bn. Uber's costs rose 147% to $8.7bn in the quarter, including a sharp rise in spending for research and development. Mr Khosrowshahi said the competitive environment is starting to rationalise and had been ""progressively improving"" since the first quarter. While the company continues to invest aggressively, it is expected to spend less on promotions and incentives to win market share. Uber and Lyft have historically relied on subsidies to attract riders, and have been spending heavily to expand into areas such as self-driving technology and food delivery. Uber, which admitted ahead of its Wall Street listing thatit may never make a profit, is trying to convince investors that growth will come not only from its ride services, but also from other logistics and food delivery services. Gross bookings, a measure of total value of rides before driver costs and other expenses, rose 31% from 2018 to $15.76bn, below analysts' forecasts of about $15.8bn. The number of monthly active users rose to 99 million globally, from 93 million at the end of the first quarter and 76 million a year earlier. ""Uber has turned into the magical money burning machine."" That's how Publicis Sapient analyst Alyssa Altman described Uber's second quarter results. The damning words go to the heart of the company's challenge: can Uber find a way to be profitable? Its latest set of results failed to assuage sceptical investors and they gave the stock the cold shoulder. It doesn't help that its rival, Lyft, suggested on Wednesday that it could achieve profitability sooner than expected. Traditionally Uber and Lyft have spent heavily on promotions to attract riders and win market share. Both companies have said that price pressure is easing. And yet Uber's costs still rose an astonishing 147%. The chief executive, Dara Khosrowshahi, is betting that future growth will come not just from ride services, but from other businesses like food delivery. The signs are that he has clearly not yet convinced investors. For Wall Street, these numbers on Thursday show this is still a company stuck in traffic. Why Uber drivers are striking in Nairobi.

"This video can not be played PM: EU should show 'common sense' on Brexit The EU should show ""common sense"" and agree to make changes to the Brexit withdrawal deal, Boris Johnson has told the BBC. The prime minister said there was ""bags of time"" for the EU to compromise on the Irish border backstop plan before the Brexit deadline of 31 October. He also warned MPs not to oppose Brexit, and to respect the 2016 referendum result. The EU has said repeatedly the backstop arrangements cannot be changed. Mr Johnson said the policy - designed to guarantee there will not be a hard Irish border after Brexit - would turn the UK into a ""satellite state"" of the EU if it came into effect. Speaking during a visit to Oxfordshire, he said the arrangements would ""keep us locked in EU regulatory orbit, locked in the EU trading system, unable to control our own laws"". ""We need change on that, once we get change on that I think we're at the races, and I think there's a good deal to be done."" Gove: EU 'refusing to negotiate' on Brexit Johnson 'absolutely' rules out early election Could there be an early general election? Theresa May's deal has been rejected three times by MPs and as things stand, the UK will leave the EU on 31 October whether it has agreed a new one or not. Many of those who voted against the deal had concerns over the backstop, which if implemented, would see Northern Ireland staying aligned to some rules of the EU single market. It would also see the UK stay in a single customs territory with the EU, and align with current and future EU rules on competition and state aid. These arrangements would apply unless and until both the EU and UK agreed they were no longer necessary. The prime minister's comments come amid growing speculation that opposition MPs will table a vote of no confidence in the government in a move to try and stop the UK leaving the EU without a deal. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has said Labour will table a no-confidence vote at an ""appropriate"" time, once MPs return from the summer break in September. What is a vote of no confidence? According to the Sunday Telegraph, Mr Johnson's senior advisor at No 10, Dominic Cummings, has told MPs even losing such a vote could not stop the PM taking the UK out of the EU on 31 October. Hereportedly saidMr Johnson could call an election for after the deadline, with Brexit taking place in the meantime. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. On Wednesday, shadow chancellor John McDonnell said he would expect Mr Johnson to step aside if he lost a no-confidence vote. ""No prime minister can sustain themselves in office when they no longer have a majority in the Commons"", he said, speaking at the Edinburgh Festival. ""I don't want to drag the Queen into this, but I would be sending Jeremy Corbyn in a cab to Buckingham Palace to say 'we're taking over'."" Asked whether he would resign in those circumstances, Mr Johnson said MPs should ensure Brexit takes place by the end of October. ""What MPs should do and what they've already voted to do, when triggering Article 50 and reconfirmed several times, is honour the mandate of the people"", he said. On Tuesday cabinet minister Michael Gove accused the EU of ""refusing to negotiate with the UK"" over a new Brexit deal. The European Commission said it was willing to hold further talks, ""should the UK wish to clarify its position"".
