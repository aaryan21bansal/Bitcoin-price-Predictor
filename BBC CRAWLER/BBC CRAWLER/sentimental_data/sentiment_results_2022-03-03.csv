"Mr Watford made his fortune in oil and gas An investigation has been launched into the death of a Ukrainian-born oligarch in Surrey earlier this week. Officers were called to a property in Portnall Drive, Wentworth, at about midday on 28 February. Mikhail Watford, aged in his 60s, was pronounced dead at the scene. An investigation into the death is under way but Surrey Police said there were not believed to be any suspicious circumstances ""at this time"". His next of kin have been told and are being supported by specially-trained officers. The body was found at an address in Portnall Drive, Wentworth It is understood that Mr Watford was born in 1955 in then-Soviet Ukraine but moved to the UK in the early 2000s. According to a Sunday Times profile in 2015, he made his fortune in oil and gas, and moved to Surrey from London with his Estonian wife Jane. He described his childhood as relatively extravagant, telling the newspaper: ""We had a big four-bedroom apartment with a bath, and a car â which, in terms of luxury, was the equivalent of travelling by jet now."" It was also reported he had changed his name from Tolstosheya after moving to the UK. The property where his body was found is on a private road on the exclusive Wentworth Estate in Virginia Water. It features three 18-hole golf courses and one 9-hole course. Former Chilean military ruler Augusto Pinochet was kept under house arrest on the estate before his extradition and, according to its website, it has been home to ""a host of famous athletes, musicians, actors and entertainers, financial figures and royalty"".

"Residents of Mariupol say they are under continuous bombardment. ""We are terrified,"" said Maxim Residents of the Ukrainian port city of Mariupol have told the BBC they are trying to survive a relentless barrage of Russian shelling that has smashed residential districts and cut off power and water supplies. ""There has been no light, no heat, and no water now for two full days and we have hardly any food left,"" said Maxim, 27, an IT developer who was hiding in his grandparents' apartment on Thursday morning. ""Food and medicine is not moving in Mariupol now. The local government tried to give out bread and water but it is gone,"" he said. ""I filled the bath with water before the water stopped. We have about five litres left."" Maxim left his apartment after the Russian invasion began last week to be with his grandparents, who are in their eighties and cannot leave their sixth-floor, city-centre apartment. The three of them are sheltering with their pets in the hallway of the apartment, with no heating in the depth of winter, hiding from a barrage of shelling. ""The shelling started again at six this morning,"" Maxim said. ""The city was completely black overnight, there was no source of light apart from the explosions. It was quiet for a few hours but then at dawn it started again. We can hear it now from every direction. We are terrified."" A detonation on the horizon, photographed by Maxim Mariupol, a city of 400,000, is a key strategic target for Russia, because seizing it would allow Russian-backed rebels in eastern Ukraine to join forces with troops in Crimea, the southern peninsula annexed by Russia in 2014. Russia's defence ministry urged civilians on Thursday to evacuate the city by a humanitarian corridor, but residents said there had been no break in the shelling to allow people to move. Communications have been virtually down for two days, residents said, preventing people in the city from reaching one another. Multiple calls to residents either disconnected repeatedly or failed to connect in the first place. Speaking to the BBC on Thursday morning, the city's deputy mayor Serhiy Orlov said the whole city was now without power, water, or its sanitation system. ""We had 15 main power lines and all of them are now down. We are getting completely cut off - destroyed by artillery. Only the natural gas supply is left,"" he said. ""Mariupol is still Ukrainian right now, we still control inside the perimeter, but there is fighting on the streets on the outskirts and we are on the line of a humanitarian crisis."" A damaged residential building in the Ukrainian port city of Mariupol Mr Orlov still hasn't been able to reach his father, mother and brother, who live together in a residential district that has been heavily bombarded since Monday night, he said. ""I can't reach them by any means, the shelling is continuous."" Dmytro, an activist in the city, told the BBC he could hear constant gunfire and explosions from where he was sheltering. After less than a minute the phone connection cut off and he couldn't be reached again. Alexander, a 44-year-old engineer in the city, said he was sheltering with his wife, two sons and mother in a five-storey building. ""We have been bombed and shelled for five days and right now I can hear shots and bombs non-stop,"" he said. ""There is still some bread at the shop near us, but we don't know when the food supply will end. What will happen when we run out of our water? What will happen when my phone battery dies? We will have no connection to the outside at all."" LIVE:Latest updates from on the ground THE BASICS:Why is Putin invading Ukraine? RUSSIA:Watching the war on TV UKRAINE:'I have never felt so much love for my homeland' IN DEPTH:Full coverage of the conflict For the family members of Mariupol residents in other parts of Ukraine, there is only the agonising wait for a phone call. Alina Hrydina, a 31-year-old marketer in Kyiv, last spoke to her parents on Wednesday morning when they called to wish her brother a happy birthday. Since then she can't reach them, or her aunt or grandmother. ""I saw some pictures online that suggested the central area where they live was still OK, not on fire,"" she said. ""This is the only thought I have right now. I am only holding on to this hope."" If Mariupol is seized by the invading Russian forces, Ukrainian troops between the city and the Donbas region seized by Russian-backed separatist forces in 2014 could be surrounded and a large new part of Ukraine's east occupied. Among the residents, there are fears Russian forces are willing to level large parts of the city in order to take it. Maxim said he was praying that the Ukrainian army would be able to hold off the invasion and restore the water supply. ""We cannot leave this apartment to get food, water, anything,"" he said. ""We are cold and at night it is completely black."" He said he would try to talk again later on Thursday but his single battery pack was less than half charged. ""I don't know how long my phone will be alive,"" he said.

"Alisher Usmanov (right) with President Putin at the Kremlin in November 2018 The UK has announced sanctions on two more Russian oligarchs - Alisher Usmanov and Igor Shuvalov following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Mr Usmanov's company USM previously had sponsorship ties with Arsenal and - until this week - Everton. Mr Shuvalov was formerly Russian President Vladimir Putin's deputy prime minister and is currently chairman of the management board of a Russian bank. The BBC has contacted the two men for their response. Everton-linked Usmanov has assets frozen Everton suspend ties with Russian companies Abramovich must face sanctions, says Starmer Under the UK government's new restrictions, their assets will be frozen and they will be banned from travelling to the UK. British citizens and businesses will not be allowed to deal with them. Boris Johnson said: ""For as long as Putin continues his barbaric attack on innocent Ukrainians we will continue to exert every power we have to inflict maximum economic pain on Putin and his war machine."" And his Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said: ""We won't stop here - our aim is to cripple the Russian economy and starve Putin's war machine."" The government said the two men had ""significant interests in the UK and close links to the Kremlin"". Mr Usmanov founded USM Holding company, an investment group that owns iron, steel and copper suppliers and the Megafon telecommunications company. The company, in which Mr Usmanov holds a 49% stake, sponsored Everton's training ground and had a naming-rights option for Everton's new stadium, due to open in 2024. However, on Wednesday, Everton suspended the company's sponsorship arrangements, saying the club was ""shocked and saddened by the appalling events unfolding in Ukraine"". Mr Usmanov's business partner Farhad Moshiri - the owner and main investor at Everton - has since stepped down from his role as chairman of USM and announced that he had severed all business links with the Russian. As part of the deal, the Megafon branding was added to two of the towers of the stadium, one of which can be seen here The Megafon branding was quickly removed from the stadium in the run-up to Thursday's televised FA Cup match At the club's FA cup match against Boreham Wood on Thursday evening, Everton's players walked out draped in Ukrainian flags, behind 22-year-old Ukrainian defender Vitaliy Mykolenko who has been made captain on just his fourth appearance for his new club. Mr Usmanov's previous ties with Arsenal ended in 2018 when he sold his 30% stake. At the time he was the second largest shareholder in the north London club. In addition to connections with Premier League clubs, the government said Mr Usmanov owned Beechwood House in Highgate, worth an estimated Â£48m, and the 16th century Sutton Place estate in Surrey. Mr Shuvalov is less well-known in the UK but the Foreign Office said he owned ""two luxury apartments in central London worth an estimated Â£11m"". The Foreign Office also said it had established an Oligarch Taskforce to co-ordinate work to sanction further oligarchs. Earlier this week, the EU froze the assets of the Mr Usmanov, saying he was ""a pro-Kremlin oligarch with particularly close ties to Russian president Vladimir Putin"". At the time, Mr Usmanov issued a statement calling the EU's decision ""unfair"" and adding that he would ""use all legal means to protect my honour and reputation"". Mr Shuvalov, the other man to be sanctioned, has worked in the Russian government as first deputy minister and government chief of staff, as well as acting as an aide to President Putin. Igor Shuvalov, seen here with President Putin, is one of 13 oligarchs to be sanctioned by the UK since the invasion of Ukraine Since 2018 he has been the chairman of the management board of VEB, one of the Russian banks recently sanctioned by the government. On Wednesday, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer had urged the prime minister to take action against Mr Shuvalov and accused the prime minister of being slow to target other individuals connected with the Putin government. Government sourceshave told the BBCit could take weeks to put together sanctions against such people. Labour, and some senior Conservative figures have said the UK should seize oligarchs' UK assets. Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat, the chairman of the Commons foreign affairs committee, said: ""We should be looking immediately to seize those assets linked to those who are profiting from Putin's war machine, holding it in trust and returning it to the Russian people as soon as possible."" Elsewhere, the UShas announcedfresh sanctions on Russian oligarchs including Mr Usmanov, Mr Shuvalov and Mr Putin's press secretary Dmitry Peskov. Authorities in France and Germany have seized yachts owned by Mr Usmanov. Mr Usmanov's yacht, Dilbar, is worth $600m Meanwhile, Justice Secretary Dominic Raab says the government will look at ways to stop lawsuits being used by wealthy individuals to intimidate journalists and organisations covering their wealth and financial interests. The government is expected to set out a number of options to alter the system, including procedural changes in courts and potential legislation. Mr Raabtold the Telegraph:,external""We will not have people close to Putin coming here to try and bankrupt people who shine a light on his excesses.""

"Denise Coates was appointed CBE for services to the community and business in 2012 Bet365 boss Denise Coates took home about Â£300m during its last financial year - Â£170m down on the previous year - as growth stalled. The billionaire founder of the online gambling firm received Â£250m in salary and a share of the company's pay-out of Â£97.5m in dividends. Ms Coates, one of Britain's wealthiest women and a major philanthropist, has received a total of about Â£1.3bn from the business in the past five years. Bet365 was created 21 years ago. Ms Coates and her brother John took over a betting shop business run by their father, spotting that online gambling could revolutionise the industry. She now owns about half of the company. Bet365's latest accounts filed at Companies House show revenues were broadly flat at Â£2.82bn in the first year of the pandemic, compared with Â£2.81bn in the previous year. Although not named in the accounts, Ms Coates has always been regarded as the person referred to as ""highest paid director"". She is thought to be Britain's biggest individual tax payer. It's unclear why the pay fell so much, although Bet365's earnings from sports betting was hit as the pandemic caused chaos to sporting schedules. A rise in betting via online slot machines and casinos helped offset the loss. Bet365 said: ""At the start of the period we experienced the almost complete cessation of sporting events. However by the end of the first half of the year, we saw the resumption of sports with the vast majority of European football leagues managing to conclude their domestic seasons."" Meanwhile, operating profit increased by 47% year-on-year to Â£285.5m, a gain the firm said was driven in large part by reduced pay packets for directors. Bet365 made charitable donations, mostly to the Denise Coates Foundation, of Â£103m, up from almost Â£90m the year before. Ms Coates achieved a first-class degree in econometrics and later trained as an accountant within the family firm. The company owns Stoke City football club, and is based in Stoke-on-Trent.

"Living in the basement - Rustam, Liana, Vera, and Tyson the cat Seven days which sparked a burning patriotic resolve in Ukraine, which propelled people the world over, from presidents and prime ministers, bankers and business leaders, football stars to figure skaters, artists and activists, to stand up and be counted to condemn Russia's aggression. The Russian rouble collapsed, the UN General Assembly called on Moscow to pull out; Russian leaders denounced this ""Russiaphobic frenzy"". And, on the ground, swathes of Europe's second-largest country were reduced to smoking ruins, a harrowing echo of Russia's blistering campaigns in Grozny and Aleppo. In the days before Russia invaded Ukraine, Kyiv was a European city of golden-domed cathedrals gleaming in the night, brightly-lit restaurants serving steaming bowls of borsch, corner kiosks pouring coffee behind frosty winter windows. And the world was a place where many thought a blitzkrieg across a border was only history's business. At the Munich Security Conference, many a government minister quietly told me ""I just don't think it will happen"". And, of course, not against the capital. But in her home in Kyiv, 37-year-old Liana was ready with bags packed, including some books; clothes ironed, enough money from an ATM to last a while. Her mother Vera refused to do the same. Her friends poked fun at her. But Liana's son Rustam, a bespectacled 13-year-old wired to his smartphone, was ready too. In the dead of night on Thursday 24 February, in a city which couldn't sleep, rumours and reports electrified social media and exploded in chat groups. This snippet ""Russian action will begin at 4am"" shot through cyberspace with the kind of chilling precision Western intelligence reports had used for weeks to warn of ""an imminent invasion"" by nearly 200,000 Russian troops and heavy weaponry now massed along the borders. Local flights kept cancelling, parents wondered if they should take their children to school in the morning, journalists started asking each other if they were staying. By 05:00, posts cascaded across the internet - ""hearing thuds"" in Kyiv, Kramatorsk, Melitopol, Chernobyl, Odessa. The list was long. At 05:58, Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba tweeted ""Putin has launched a full-scale invasion"". Hours earlier, President Vladimir Putin had announced the start of a ""special military operation"" in eastern Ukraine. At 06:00 Liana called her mother. ""I told you so. Are you packed?"" By nightfall, roads out of Kyiv were gridlocked. Homes were emptied of energy as a city went underground, to basements and bomb shelters, to subway stations with marble stairways and magnificent mosaics built deep below in the 1960s to also double as Cold War bunkers. It was a day which ended the tidy life of Liana, who runs a small office supply company, and terrified her mammoth Maine Coon cat, who found he couldn't live up to his namesake - the US professional boxer Mike Tyson known as Iron Mike. I met them all in a cavernous basement in the city centre, two floors below ground, where our BBC team also took shelter. A tight-knit family, including mother Vera with a shock of red hair and an even warmer smile, took up residence on thin mats on the hard floor next to ours. Lyse broadcasting from the basement ""It was a difficult night,"" declared champion boxer-turned-mayor Vitali Klitschko as the day dawned on Saturday with news that Russian forces were now advancing on Ukrainian cities from the north, east, and south. ""Russian troops are not in our city,"" he reassured ""Kyivians"" who woke - if they slept at all - asking that very question. His rallying cry was amplified hours later, on that day, and every day after, by the comedian-turned-president-in-a-suit-turned-wartime-leader-in-olive-green-attire. ""We won't lay down our arms,' President Volodmyr Zelensky declared, rebuffing ""fake news"" that he'd done the opposite. ""Are you worried?"" I asked Liana. ""I can't be sad, I must be hopeful to support our president,"" she exclaimed in her own act of resistance underground. Tyson, however, was hiding upstairs, under a bed. And Liana worried about her father living north of the capital, in a village close to Chernobyl, now occupied by Russian forces. He'd crept out of his home last night, crawling through fields under cover of darkness, to see Russian troops throwing tarpaulin over heavy weaponry to hide them from view. In Kyiv, air raid sirens were now blaring day and night, a chilling soundtrack of the city. A weekend curfew came in force. We discreetly rigged up a smartphone to broadcast from the basement where at least five dogs, including Kurt a puffy white Pomeranian named after the American singer-songwriter, and Andrew, a trembling Yorkshire terrier, never seemed to bark. On Sunday, Liana and Vera rushed pell-mell toward me. ""What happened?"" I asked, trying to suppress a note of worry. ""Thank you, thank you!"" they shouted excitedly, words tumbling over the other. Their friends in the US, Britain, and the UAE had sent them screenshots of our BBC broadcast. There they were, in the corner of the screen, quietly sitting along the wall. ""Now they know we're safe!"" they gushed, reflecting that surge of anxiety worldwide in the large Ukrainian diaspora as the invasion intensified. But news from Liana's father was ominous. He could hear Russian tanks rumbling past, heading south towards Kyiv. His electricity was now cut; he cooked potato soup outside, on an open fire in sub-zero temperatures, all the while trying to hide the flame. By Monday, when the weekend curfew lifted, satellite images shared by Maxar technology revealed a massive Russian armoured column, stretching along 40 miles (64km) of road, stopped just 20 miles from Kyiv. The plight of other cities was even more foreboding. Residential areas of Kharkiv, the second largest city to the west, were being pounded - so was Chernihiv to the north. Sleeping quarters Thin mats have been replaced by mattresses in this new subterranean world - Ukraine beds down and digs in. All through the night, smartphones glow under covers.  Liana, like everyone else, connects incessantly with friends and family across Ukraine and beyond. A Russian missile has slammed into her father's vegetable garden, smashing his sustenance for the long run. Rustam, intense at the best of times, is now an extension of his phone saturated by everything Ukraine. Sometimes Tyson the cat emerges from under his bed above ground for a comforting cuddle. Russia's Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu has vowed to continue the offensive until ""its goals are achieved"". It's been a week of war. Unparalleled sanctions imposed on Russia are being described as economic war. A war crimes investigation has already been launched, and everyone everywhere is taking a stand. Even the International Feline Federation (FIFe) has banned the import of any Russian breeds of cats. The southern city of Kherson has fallen. Mariupol is encircled by Russian forces, without electricity, running water, or enough food. The armoured convoy north of Kyiv still hasn't made its move. And Liana is in a flood of tears. ""Eight Russian soldiers barged into my father's house last night looking for cigarettes, and they've taken over his house,"" she wails. She hears a story about a family who tried to flee and was shot dead on the spot. They're looking for young men able to fight. She says her elderly father sits in a chair and doesn't dare move. In some areas, whole neighbourhoods have been obliterated by Russian firepower or seem to be under its sway. Now it's the second week. More than a million Ukrainians have fled. Many are staying to pick up guns to fight. ""We are the nation that broke the plans of the enemy in the first week,"" boasts President Zelensky in his latest video message, still dressed in olive-green. President Putin announces his ""special military operation is going according to plan"", vowing to ""destroy this anti-Russia created by the West"". Last night Kyiv was rocked by explosions, coming ever closer to city centre, which painted the sky orange.

"Returnal has eight Bafta games nominations It Takes Two, a co-operative game about a family break-up, and action title Returnal lead the way in the race for this year's Bafta Games Awards. They have each been nominated for eight of the famous golden masks. Bafta has been recognising the cultural impact of games since 2004 and the awards are arguably the most prestigious in the gaming industry. Ratchet and Clank, Forza Horizon 5, Psychonauts 2 and Deathloop have also been nominated in multiple categories. After two virtual ceremonies during the Covid pandemic, this year will see a return to an in-person event in London on 7 April. BBC Sounds podcast Press X to Continue looks back at the best games of 2021 In a sign of the variety that is now on offer in the ever-growing gaming industry, you could not pick two more different titles than It Takes Two and Returnal. The former, which picked up the main prize atlast year's Game Awards, is a throwback to gaming in the mid-1990s with it's bright cartoon aesthetic and emphasis on local co-operative play. With the dominance of online multiplayer gaming in recent years, the success of this title is an example of how players are calling for more experiences that allow them to connect with people in the same room. Heightened, no doubt, by the pandemic and lockdowns. In the game, Cody and May are planning a divorce and their daughter Rose tries to bring them back together. Players must work with each other to solve a series of engaging puzzles. So successful has it been that the title's developers are working on a movie version. It has been nominated in categories like best game, artistic achievement and the ""game beyond entertainment"" category. Returnal, on the other hand, is a dark, futuristic, psychological horror experience that involves frantic bursts of action. The Playstation 5 exclusive makes the most of new console technology and has struck a chord with players for itscompelling and challenging gameplay. It was named game of the year at theDevelop: Star Awards,externaland has now been nominated in categories like best game, game design and technical achievement. Deathloop has five nominations Alongside Returnal, PlayStation bosses will be happy that two of its other exclusive games are among those with the most nominations. Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart, a game that is seen by some reviewers as one of the few titles to have made the most of the latest generation of consoles, has seven nominations. Deathloop has five nominations, including best game. It has just missed out on winning big at various other ceremonies and will be a strong contender for the main prize. The Bafta Games Awards love throwing up a surprise result. Last year, ancient Greece-themed action title Hades walked away with the main prize for best game. The games industry is often seen, in mainstream press outlets, through the prism of its financial impact - worthÂ£7bn to the UK economy.,external The Bafta Games Awards gives the industry the opportunity to focus on the cultural impact gaming has on people's lives. Most winners will be selected by a panel of judges from the industry, but the public can vote for the EE Game of the Year Award. Chicory: A Colorful Tale, Deathloop, It Takes Two, Metroid Dread, The Forgotten City and Unpacking are the six titles competing for the award.

"Thirty years ago when communism collapsed in the Soviet Union, Western firms stepped up their presence in Russia. The arrival of big Western companies symbolised the start of a new era with Russians becoming eager consumers of brands ranging from fast-food chain McDonalds to Levi jeans and luxury goods. Now, in the wake of President Putin's invasion of Ukraine, a growing number of firms have suspended activities in Russia. So which firms, in which sectors, are exiting and why have others held back? McDonald's, Coca-Cola, Starbucks and Heinekenare the latest companies to announce they are halting business in Russia after mounting pressure to act. McDonald's said it was temporarily closing its roughly 850 restaurants in Russia, while Starbucks also said its 100 coffee shops would shut. The firms were initially remained tight lipped over the conflict, but took action because shareholders ""wouldn't stand"" for the continued generation of profits from Russia, says Anna MacDonald, a fund manager at Amati Global Investors. ""It was affecting their share prices and the feeling was that it was just utterly inappropriate to continue to do so,"" she told the BBC. Pepsi, which has a much larger presence in Russia than rival Coca-Cola, said it was halting the production and sale of Pepsi and other global brands in Russia, but the company, which employs 20,000 people there, said it would continue to offer other products. Food companies Nestle, Mondelez, Procter & Gamble and Unilever have halted investment in Russia, but said they would continue providing essentials. British American Tobacco has announced it plans to sell its business in Russia due to it being ""no longer sustainable in the current environment"". The world's biggest cosmetics firm L'Oreal and rivalEstee Lauder are both closing shops,externaland ceasing online sales. Estee Lauder, whose brands include Michael Kors, DKNY, Clinique and Bobbi Brown, has had a presence in the country for about 30 years and Russia was where it had some of its strongest sales. In fact, Russia was the fifth largest European retail market globally last year, valued at Â£337.2bn. So some brands may not want to burn their bridges, if there's a chance of returning at a later date. That is why many firms, including other luxury retailers like Burberry and Chanel, simply say they are ""suspending"" sales and temporarily shutting stores rather than withdrawing altogether, says Chris Weafer, chief executive of consulting firm Macro-advisory Limited. With sanctions limiting forms of payment and huge uncertainty over future prices and consumer appetite, the business climate is ""extremely challenging"" he adds, making the decision to hit pause easier. The world's biggest fashion retailers H&M and Zara-owner Inditex,which has 502 stores in the country, for examplehave already suspended sales in Russia, citing ""tragic developments"" in Ukraine. Other brands like Nike have simply said they can't currently guarantee delivery of goods to customers in Russia. More brands are likely to follow suit, according to Maureen Hinton of retail consultancy GlobalData. Boohoo, Swedish furniture giant Ikea and Japanese clothing retailer Uniqlo which initially kept its 49 Russian stores open,saying clothes were a ""necessity of life"", are some of the other names to have now cut ties. Even Levi's, the jeans brand that became a symbol of post-Soviet business in Russia, has closed its shops.The all-American jeans firm said about,external4% of its total net sales came from Eastern Europe and Russia last year, but ""any business considerations are clearly secondary to the human suffering experienced by so many"". Samsung, the leading supplier of smartphones in Russia,has said it will suspend shipments to the country but has not said whether its shops will close. Japan's Sony and Nintendo suspended deliveries of gaming consoles, and Sony suspended the launch of racing game ""Gran Turismo 7"". Apple has also halted all of its product sales in Russia, andlimited other services such as Apple Pay and Apple Maps. Its shops have closed too. All shops under the Re:store in Moscow have been shut as Apple halts all product sales in Russia For a firm like Apple selling imported items, that's a relatively straightforward decision to take, suggests Macro-advisory's Chris Weafer. ""Companies do not want to be associated with the Russian regime and what's happening in Ukraine,"" he says. Their Russian business may be profitable, but ""the rest of the world is more important"" when it comes to reputational risk. Some tech companies, flooded by misinformation, are also restricting Kremlin-linked media outlets posting on their platforms.Facebook was blockedin Russia after it said it had refused to stop fact-checking and labelling content from state-owned news organisations. Meanwhile,TikTok has blocked all non-Russian content in Russia and suspended live streaming, although it is allowing historical content uploaded by domestic accounts to stay online, including videos by state-backed media services. Large consultancy and law firms were some of the first to set up a presence in Russia after the collapse of the Soviet Union but they mostly operate out of the spotlight. All of the Big Four accounting groups - Deloitte, KPMG, EY and PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) - have said they will no longer have a member firm in Russia because of the invasion. Top-tier law firm Freshfields says it will no longer work with any clients linked to the Russian state either. Others say they are reviewing their client base and Russian links. What sanctions are being imposed on Russia? How badly will Russia be hit by new sanctions? A senior executive for consultancy firm McKinsey, for example, wrote online that the company would ""no longer serve"" any government or state-owned entities in Russia. According to McKinsey's website, it serves 21 of the 30 biggest Russian companies. When the conflict in Ukraine broke out, energy firms came under immediate pressure. And that is set to intensify now the UK, US and UKhave announced bans or curbs on Russian oil and gas. BP owns a large stake in Russian energy giant Rosneft, but within days of the war starting ithad announcedthe operation would be hived off. That was closely followed bypledges from Shell,ExxonMobiland Equinor to cut their Russian investments following pressure from shareholders, as well as from governments and the public. A Rosneft oil rig drilling the first exploration well in the Khatanga Bay, Russia Firms want to be seen to be doing the ""right thing"", says Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell. Meanwhile, Total Energies, another big player in Russia, has said it won't fund new projects in the country, but unlike its peers does not plan to sell existing investments. It is still far from clear what will happen to those investments - whether they can eventually be sold, recouping some of their value, or if they will simply be written off at great cost. Film fans in Russia wanting to go and see Warner Bros' new blockbuster The Batman won't be able to after the companysuspended new film releases in the country. The US movie-maker was joined by Disney and Sony, with premieres of animation Turning Red and Marvel adaptation Morbius also being withdrawn. Disney has also paused its TV channels. Netflix, a fairly new entrant in Russia, has suspendedits service in the country and put all ""future projects"" on pause. Pixar's new animated film Turning Red won't be released in Russia All companies said their decisions were based on the ""humanitarian crisis"" in Ukraine, rather than as a result of sanctions that have been imposed. All three of the world's major record labels - Sony, Warner and Universal - have closed their offices in Russia, and Spotify has announced it is cancelling its subscription service, although the free, ad-funded version will still work. Payment giantsVisa, Mastercard, American Expressand PayPal are pulling out of the Russian market in protest. Russian banks have, however, already downplayed the impact of the announcements on their clients. Sberbank, for example, said that Visa and Mastercard-branded cards would continue to work on Russian territory because all payments in Russia are made through a national system. However, domestically issued cards won't work abroad, and foreign-issued ones won't work inside the country. US investment bankGoldman Sachs was the first Wall Street bank to say it was winding down its Russian business. The bank, soon followed by JPMorgan, said it was doing so in compliance with regulatory and licensing requirements. German lender Deutsche Bank, which had faced criticism for defending plans not to withdraw, has also said it was taking steps to exit, pledging ""there won't be any new business in Russia"". Jaguar Land Rover, General Motors, Aston Martin and Rolls-Royce are among the car-makers that have halted deliveries of vehicles to Russia due to the conflict, whileconstruction equipment manufacturer JCB has paused all operations. Jaguar Land Rover said sales were paused due to ""trading challenges"" Cars are the biggest UK export to Russia, but still only 1% of UK cars went to Russia last year. So any decision to stop exporting won't be particularly costly, and will have been made easier by nagging concerns over whether or not payments will arrive, says investment analyst Russ Mould. Transporting cars to Russia could prove difficult anyway, with the world's two largest cargo shipping companies, MSC and Maersk, suspending routes to and from Russia, except for food, medical and humanitarian supply deliveries. While the flood of announcements from companies stepping back goes on, there are calls for more to join them. Attention has turned to big food firms like Burger King who have condemned Russia's actions and have pledged support for Ukraine, but are yet to pull out. Some firms will also find it much harder to extricate themselves, even if pressure mounts in the coming days and weeks. In retaliation against sanctions introduced by Western countries, Moscow has banned the sale of Russian assets. So firms that, in recent years, have been encouraged to establish a presence in Russia are ""locked in"" with local businesses, staff and supply chains. Marks & Spencer, for example, has 48 shops in Russia but they are operated by a Turkish franchise company called FiBA. M&S has said it is suspending shipments of its goods to FiBA's Russian business, but the shops in the country remain open. Restaurant Brands International,which owns Burger King, told the BBC its Russian outlets were operated by franchiseeswith which it had ""long-standing legal agreements"" that were not easy to change. Yum Brands, which owns KFC and Pizza Hut, said it was suspending operations in the Russian KFC restaurants it owns, and finalising an agreement with its main franchisee to temporarily halt Pizza Hut operations. Mr Weafer predicts it is likely that some large consumer brands may express concerns over the military conflict, but try to ""ride it out"".

"Living in the basement - Rustam, Liana, Vera, and Tyson the cat Seven days which sparked a burning patriotic resolve in Ukraine, which propelled people the world over, from presidents and prime ministers, bankers and business leaders, football stars to figure skaters, artists and activists, to stand up and be counted to condemn Russia's aggression. The Russian rouble collapsed, the UN General Assembly called on Moscow to pull out; Russian leaders denounced this ""Russiaphobic frenzy"". And, on the ground, swathes of Europe's second-largest country were reduced to smoking ruins, a harrowing echo of Russia's blistering campaigns in Grozny and Aleppo. In the days before Russia invaded Ukraine, Kyiv was a European city of golden-domed cathedrals gleaming in the night, brightly-lit restaurants serving steaming bowls of borsch, corner kiosks pouring coffee behind frosty winter windows. And the world was a place where many thought a blitzkrieg across a border was only history's business. At the Munich Security Conference, many a government minister quietly told me ""I just don't think it will happen"". And, of course, not against the capital. But in her home in Kyiv, 37-year-old Liana was ready with bags packed, including some books; clothes ironed, enough money from an ATM to last a while. Her mother Vera refused to do the same. Her friends poked fun at her. But Liana's son Rustam, a bespectacled 13-year-old wired to his smartphone, was ready too. In the dead of night on Thursday 24 February, in a city which couldn't sleep, rumours and reports electrified social media and exploded in chat groups. This snippet ""Russian action will begin at 4am"" shot through cyberspace with the kind of chilling precision Western intelligence reports had used for weeks to warn of ""an imminent invasion"" by nearly 200,000 Russian troops and heavy weaponry now massed along the borders. Local flights kept cancelling, parents wondered if they should take their children to school in the morning, journalists started asking each other if they were staying. By 05:00, posts cascaded across the internet - ""hearing thuds"" in Kyiv, Kramatorsk, Melitopol, Chernobyl, Odessa. The list was long. At 05:58, Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba tweeted ""Putin has launched a full-scale invasion"". Hours earlier, President Vladimir Putin had announced the start of a ""special military operation"" in eastern Ukraine. At 06:00 Liana called her mother. ""I told you so. Are you packed?"" By nightfall, roads out of Kyiv were gridlocked. Homes were emptied of energy as a city went underground, to basements and bomb shelters, to subway stations with marble stairways and magnificent mosaics built deep below in the 1960s to also double as Cold War bunkers. It was a day which ended the tidy life of Liana, who runs a small office supply company, and terrified her mammoth Maine Coon cat, who found he couldn't live up to his namesake - the US professional boxer Mike Tyson known as Iron Mike. I met them all in a cavernous basement in the city centre, two floors below ground, where our BBC team also took shelter. A tight-knit family, including mother Vera with a shock of red hair and an even warmer smile, took up residence on thin mats on the hard floor next to ours. Lyse broadcasting from the basement ""It was a difficult night,"" declared champion boxer-turned-mayor Vitali Klitschko as the day dawned on Saturday with news that Russian forces were now advancing on Ukrainian cities from the north, east, and south. ""Russian troops are not in our city,"" he reassured ""Kyivians"" who woke - if they slept at all - asking that very question. His rallying cry was amplified hours later, on that day, and every day after, by the comedian-turned-president-in-a-suit-turned-wartime-leader-in-olive-green-attire. ""We won't lay down our arms,' President Volodmyr Zelensky declared, rebuffing ""fake news"" that he'd done the opposite. ""Are you worried?"" I asked Liana. ""I can't be sad, I must be hopeful to support our president,"" she exclaimed in her own act of resistance underground. Tyson, however, was hiding upstairs, under a bed. And Liana worried about her father living north of the capital, in a village close to Chernobyl, now occupied by Russian forces. He'd crept out of his home last night, crawling through fields under cover of darkness, to see Russian troops throwing tarpaulin over heavy weaponry to hide them from view. In Kyiv, air raid sirens were now blaring day and night, a chilling soundtrack of the city. A weekend curfew came in force. We discreetly rigged up a smartphone to broadcast from the basement where at least five dogs, including Kurt a puffy white Pomeranian named after the American singer-songwriter, and Andrew, a trembling Yorkshire terrier, never seemed to bark. On Sunday, Liana and Vera rushed pell-mell toward me. ""What happened?"" I asked, trying to suppress a note of worry. ""Thank you, thank you!"" they shouted excitedly, words tumbling over the other. Their friends in the US, Britain, and the UAE had sent them screenshots of our BBC broadcast. There they were, in the corner of the screen, quietly sitting along the wall. ""Now they know we're safe!"" they gushed, reflecting that surge of anxiety worldwide in the large Ukrainian diaspora as the invasion intensified. But news from Liana's father was ominous. He could hear Russian tanks rumbling past, heading south towards Kyiv. His electricity was now cut; he cooked potato soup outside, on an open fire in sub-zero temperatures, all the while trying to hide the flame. By Monday, when the weekend curfew lifted, satellite images shared by Maxar technology revealed a massive Russian armoured column, stretching along 40 miles (64km) of road, stopped just 20 miles from Kyiv. The plight of other cities was even more foreboding. Residential areas of Kharkiv, the second largest city to the west, were being pounded - so was Chernihiv to the north. Sleeping quarters Thin mats have been replaced by mattresses in this new subterranean world - Ukraine beds down and digs in. All through the night, smartphones glow under covers.  Liana, like everyone else, connects incessantly with friends and family across Ukraine and beyond. A Russian missile has slammed into her father's vegetable garden, smashing his sustenance for the long run. Rustam, intense at the best of times, is now an extension of his phone saturated by everything Ukraine. Sometimes Tyson the cat emerges from under his bed above ground for a comforting cuddle. Russia's Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu has vowed to continue the offensive until ""its goals are achieved"". It's been a week of war. Unparalleled sanctions imposed on Russia are being described as economic war. A war crimes investigation has already been launched, and everyone everywhere is taking a stand. Even the International Feline Federation (FIFe) has banned the import of any Russian breeds of cats. The southern city of Kherson has fallen. Mariupol is encircled by Russian forces, without electricity, running water, or enough food. The armoured convoy north of Kyiv still hasn't made its move. And Liana is in a flood of tears. ""Eight Russian soldiers barged into my father's house last night looking for cigarettes, and they've taken over his house,"" she wails. She hears a story about a family who tried to flee and was shot dead on the spot. They're looking for young men able to fight. She says her elderly father sits in a chair and doesn't dare move. In some areas, whole neighbourhoods have been obliterated by Russian firepower or seem to be under its sway. Now it's the second week. More than a million Ukrainians have fled. Many are staying to pick up guns to fight. ""We are the nation that broke the plans of the enemy in the first week,"" boasts President Zelensky in his latest video message, still dressed in olive-green. President Putin announces his ""special military operation is going according to plan"", vowing to ""destroy this anti-Russia created by the West"". Last night Kyiv was rocked by explosions, coming ever closer to city centre, which painted the sky orange. When the night curfew lifts, Liana and her mother Vera make a dash to the shops to check for supplies - including cat food - on fast-emptying shelves. Then she settles in to try to read the tome she packed for what could be a long and anxious haul.

"Mr Watford made his fortune in oil and gas An investigation has been launched into the death of a Ukrainian-born oligarch in Surrey earlier this week. Officers were called to a property in Portnall Drive, Wentworth, at about midday on 28 February. Mikhail Watford, aged in his 60s, was pronounced dead at the scene. An investigation into the death is under way but Surrey Police said there were not believed to be any suspicious circumstances ""at this time"". His next of kin have been told and are being supported by specially-trained officers. The body was found at an address in Portnall Drive, Wentworth It is understood that Mr Watford was born in 1955 in then-Soviet Ukraine but moved to the UK in the early 2000s. According to a Sunday Times profile in 2015, he made his fortune in oil and gas, and moved to Surrey from London with his Estonian wife Jane. He described his childhood as relatively extravagant, telling the newspaper: ""We had a big four-bedroom apartment with a bath, and a car â which, in terms of luxury, was the equivalent of travelling by jet now."" It was also reported he had changed his name from Tolstosheya after moving to the UK. The property where his body was found is on a private road on the exclusive Wentworth Estate in Virginia Water. It features three 18-hole golf courses and one 9-hole course. Former Chilean military ruler Augusto Pinochet was kept under house arrest on the estate before his extradition and, according to its website, it has been home to ""a host of famous athletes, musicians, actors and entertainers, financial figures and royalty"".

"Alisher Usmanov (right) with President Putin at the Kremlin in November 2018 The UK has announced sanctions on two more Russian oligarchs - Alisher Usmanov and Igor Shuvalov following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Mr Usmanov's company USM previously had sponsorship ties with Arsenal and - until this week - Everton. Mr Shuvalov was formerly Russian President Vladimir Putin's deputy prime minister and is currently chairman of the management board of a Russian bank. The BBC has contacted the two men for their response. Everton-linked Usmanov has assets frozen Everton suspend ties with Russian companies Abramovich must face sanctions, says Starmer Under the UK government's new restrictions, their assets will be frozen and they will be banned from travelling to the UK. British citizens and businesses will not be allowed to deal with them. Boris Johnson said: ""For as long as Putin continues his barbaric attack on innocent Ukrainians we will continue to exert every power we have to inflict maximum economic pain on Putin and his war machine."" And his Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said: ""We won't stop here - our aim is to cripple the Russian economy and starve Putin's war machine."" The government said the two men had ""significant interests in the UK and close links to the Kremlin"". Mr Usmanov founded USM Holding company, an investment group that owns iron, steel and copper suppliers and the Megafon telecommunications company. The company, in which Mr Usmanov holds a 49% stake, sponsored Everton's training ground and had a naming-rights option for Everton's new stadium, due to open in 2024. However, on Wednesday, Everton suspended the company's sponsorship arrangements, saying the club was ""shocked and saddened by the appalling events unfolding in Ukraine"". Mr Usmanov's business partner Farhad Moshiri - the owner and main investor at Everton - has since stepped down from his role as chairman of USM and announced that he had severed all business links with the Russian. As part of the deal, the Megafon branding was added to two of the towers of the stadium, one of which can be seen here The Megafon branding was quickly removed from the stadium in the run-up to Thursday's televised FA Cup match At the club's FA cup match against Boreham Wood on Thursday evening, Everton's players walked out draped in Ukrainian flags, behind 22-year-old Ukrainian defender Vitaliy Mykolenko who has been made captain on just his fourth appearance for his new club. Mr Usmanov's previous ties with Arsenal ended in 2018 when he sold his 30% stake. At the time he was the second largest shareholder in the north London club. In addition to connections with Premier League clubs, the government said Mr Usmanov owned Beechwood House in Highgate, worth an estimated Â£48m, and the 16th century Sutton Place estate in Surrey. Mr Shuvalov is less well-known in the UK but the Foreign Office said he owned ""two luxury apartments in central London worth an estimated Â£11m"". The Foreign Office also said it had established an Oligarch Taskforce to co-ordinate work to sanction further oligarchs. Earlier this week, the EU froze the assets of the Mr Usmanov, saying he was ""a pro-Kremlin oligarch with particularly close ties to Russian president Vladimir Putin"". At the time, Mr Usmanov issued a statement calling the EU's decision ""unfair"" and adding that he would ""use all legal means to protect my honour and reputation"". Mr Shuvalov, the other man to be sanctioned, has worked in the Russian government as first deputy minister and government chief of staff, as well as acting as an aide to President Putin. Igor Shuvalov, seen here with President Putin, is one of 13 oligarchs to be sanctioned by the UK since the invasion of Ukraine Since 2018 he has been the chairman of the management board of VEB, one of the Russian banks recently sanctioned by the government. On Wednesday, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer had urged the prime minister to take action against Mr Shuvalov and accused the prime minister of being slow to target other individuals connected with the Putin government. Government sourceshave told the BBCit could take weeks to put together sanctions against such people. Labour, and some senior Conservative figures have said the UK should seize oligarchs' UK assets. Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat, the chairman of the Commons foreign affairs committee, said: ""We should be looking immediately to seize those assets linked to those who are profiting from Putin's war machine, holding it in trust and returning it to the Russian people as soon as possible."" Elsewhere, the UShas announcedfresh sanctions on Russian oligarchs including Mr Usmanov, Mr Shuvalov and Mr Putin's press secretary Dmitry Peskov. Authorities in France and Germany have seized yachts owned by Mr Usmanov. Mr Usmanov's yacht, Dilbar, is worth $600m Meanwhile, Justice Secretary Dominic Raab says the government will look at ways to stop lawsuits being used by wealthy individuals to intimidate journalists and organisations covering their wealth and financial interests. The government is expected to set out a number of options to alter the system, including procedural changes in courts and potential legislation. Mr Raabtold the Telegraph:,external""We will not have people close to Putin coming here to try and bankrupt people who shine a light on his excesses.""

"The Russian rouble dropped precipitously last week A raft of actions by the West is aimed at choking Russia's economy and banking system, and punishing Vladimir Putin's inner circle. What more sanctions could they impose? In response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the US, UK, EU and more than two dozen other nations retaliated with economic measures that have sent the Russian rouble tumbling, cut major Russian banks from the global financial system and hurt state-owned firms and oligarchs, including Mr Putin himself. The US says its actions hit 80% of banking assets in Russia; and the EU 70%. The allies have also taken steps to limit Russia's access to key technology, such as microchips and lasers; and moved against cryptocurrencies. Together, they represent the toughest sanctions Mr Putin's Russia has ever faced. And analysts expect policymakers to continue tightening - for example, by adding more kinds of technology and new companies to blacklists. The most recent action by the US, on Wednesday, targeted oil refining equipment, among other steps. ""We are at a seven or eight out of 10 on the escalation ladder right now,"" said Emily Kilcrease, senior fellow and director of the Energy, Economics and Security Program at the Washington think tank, the Center for New American Security. ""There is definitely still room to go with tightening."" Many Western companies, including BP, Apple and others have responded to the situation by taking steps to halt services or exit the country. What sanctions are being imposed on Russia? 'I can't pay' - Russians feel the pain of sanctions Russian oligarch warns sanctions will not stop war But for now, trade can still flow - not least key exports like oil and gas, for which Russia is a major global supplier. Western policymakers have been reluctant to hit energy, in part for fear of causing a spike in energy prices that would cause economic damage at home as well - especially in Europe, which relies on Russia for roughly 40% of its gas imports and roughly 30% of its oil imports. But as the violence in Ukraine has escalated, there is growing pressure on the US and Europe to act. Will the West target Russian oil and gas exports for sanctions? ""My sense is that it's going to become politically untenable to say we'll keep paying Russia for oil, gas and coal,"" says Christopher Miller, professor at Tufts University's Fletcher School and an expert on the Russian economy. ""That's already been politically tough for Western leaders to stand by and I think it's going to become even tougher as the Russian military escalates its use of force."" It's a tricky calculus. While oil and gas transactions are key to preventing the Russian economy from going ""off a cliff"", cutting off that lifeline risks provoking more extreme reaction by Russia, says Jeffrey Schott, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a Washington think tank. ""The level of economic pressure now is severe. If you go for the economic jugular, Putin may respond with cyber and military action that will only make the suffering worse,"" he says. What's more the commitment, announced by Western allies this week, to release a 60m barrels of oil from strategic national reserves - half of which will come from the US - will only act to soften a temporary spike in prices. Russia may be able to withstand the loss of Western buyers, if it can sell less on the global markets at a higher price, says Ms Kilcrease. ""People I think want to see something there... but you have to think about the effect of what cutting off those sales would actually be. Will it hurt Russia? It's not actually clear,"" she says. The sanctions have already caused economic havoc in Russia. Before closing this week, the two major Moscow stock indexes plunged more than 20%. The rouble has dropped to record lows against the dollar, hurting the purchasing power of Russian families at a time when rising prices and deteriorating standard of living were already concerns. The war has sparked protests in Russia, which has also seen the standard of living slide in recent years The consultancy Capital Economics recently estimated that the sanctions could shrink Russia's economy by 15% this year. Nor has the pain been limited to Russia. Global oil prices have already risen more than 10% since the start of February amid the tensions - and analysts expect they will remain elevated due to uncertainty from the conflict. Ukraine and Russia also supply nearly 30% of the world's wheat, 19% of its corn and 80% of its sunflower oil. Currencies in countries with close ties to Russia, like Kazakhstan, have also been hit. ""That's the problem with sanctions - they never just end up targeting only one place,"" says Kristy Ironside, professor of Russian and Soviet history at McGill University. ""They tend to have other knock-on effects so anything [policymakers] do next, they have to consider very carefully in light of that."" LIVE:Latest updates from on the ground THE BASICS:Why is Putin invading Ukraine? RUSSIA:Watching the war on TV UKRAINE:'I have never felt so much love for my homeland' IN DEPTH:Full coverage of the conflict Nor is it clear how economic destabilisation will affect Mr Putin's standing at home - or if they will make him willing to negotiate a political end to the violence in Ukraine. After all, Russians have endured economic isolation before and the ability to afford international travel and imported cheese may not matter much to his base. ""As long as pensions keep getting paid and people can enjoy a relatively reasonable standard of living... I think there's some leeway,"" Prof Ironside says. ""If this is sustained... I don't know."" Prof Miller says he is not optimistic that the sanctions will force Mr Putin to negotiate over Ukraine. But if sustained, he says, they may curb his power. ""Anything that touches the financial system is going to get more complicated and expensive as a result of this,"" Prof Miller says. ""That will have a ripple effect throughout the Russian economy."" ""It will make Russia's economic outlook over the next couple of years substantially dimmer and therefore make it harder for the Russian government to keep its domestic political situation under control while simultaneously waging a set of wars abroad."" ""This is the goal,"" he adds. ""To create this medium to longer term degradation of Russia's abilities."" What are the sanctions on Russia and are they working?

"Nearly all services have been affected due to a second 24-hour strike this week No Tube service is expected before 08:00 GMT on Friday, TfL says The first strike on Tuesday resulted in all London Underground lines being hit About 10,000 London Underground workers from the RMT union have walked out in a dispute is over pensions, jobs and working conditions Anna Lindsay and Sarah Lee Londoners look for other means of transport as the second Tube strike this week causes travel misery. Sarah LeeBBC London And with that, that's all from us here at BBC London this evening. We're off to try and find a bus. Over and out! Helen HoddinottJournalist I've just spoken to a commuter at King's Cross, Annette, who told me she is carrying on with her evening plans in central London, despite the strike. ""I'm meeting some friends for dinner tonight in Soho,"" she tells me. ""I would normally get there from on the Northern Line to Leicester Square and then walk. ""But today I got the overground and I'm just trying work out how to get there from Kings Cross. ""It's a bit bleak at the moment but I'm sure I'll get there at some point."" The picture is worsening this evening. All Tubes lines are now completely suspended except the Central Line, according to Transport for London (TfL). The Central Line has a limited service between Loughton and Liverpool Street, between Newbury Park and Liverpool Street via Hainault, and between White City and Ealing Broadway/West Ruislip. DLR and London Overground have reduced services. Tom EdwardsTransport Correspondent, BBC London So where have two days of strikes and what will be, by tomorrow, four days of disruption got us? What has changed? Not much. Undoubtedly the RMT union has made its point, by closing the Tube, that it takes the threat to pensions very seriously. But has that led to a rethink by Transport for London (TfL) chiefs? No. TfL has to carry out the pension review as part of the emergency funding it received from central government. It is going to happen and is set to report back on 31 March. The worry for commuters is the dispute could actually escalate. The other Tube drivers' union Aslef might not like the pension proposals, so it, too, could strike. Both sides in this are bound to their positions - the unions by their members and TfL by the funding settlement. Could the government change the funding? Very unlikely. So I think this could just be the beginning. Helen HoddinottJournalist All the entrances to the underground at King's Cross have been gated off ahead of the evening rush hour. Outside of the station, people are waiting for the buses, but one bus did not stop and would not let anyone else on - it was that crammed. I saw a bus on the other side of the road heading towards central London, which is also looking very packed - there is a bit of a crowd waiting there. People I've spoken to say they are determined to head into central London for their Thursday evening plans. The taxi rank has about 40 people waiting in front of it at the moment. Night is finally falling on the second 24-hour Tube strike. Today has felt less chaotic than Tuesday as people have seemed to have planned accordingly. BBC London For a full round-up of today's Tube strike tune into BBC One,or click on iPlayer,from 18:35 GMT to watch BBC London analyse what has been happening today and what is expected for tomorrow. BBC London's Transport Correspondent Tom Edwards will have all the latest. Tom EdwardsTransport Correspondent, BBC London This is a red hot issue for the unions. The other unions - Aslef and the TSSA - also do not want changes to the pension. The government has said the mayor should present a report on how to make the pension scheme ""financially sustainable"" by the end of March. The funding document says: ""As part of the review of TfL's pension scheme, TfL will deliver a final report, including a recommended approach and implementation plan by no later than 31 March 2022."" It feels more like the beginning than the end of this dispute and that means more strikes are likely. Not much has changed in the past hour - the strike by 10,000 Tube workers is continuing to cause chaos for travellers in the capital this rush hour: The RMT union representing the 10,000 Tube workers on strike fears spending cuts linked to a funding deal by the government will lead to hundreds of job losses, reduced pensions and worse working conditions. RMT general secretary Mick Lynchsaid: ""The fight goes on and our executive will consider the next steps in the campaign. ""We remain available for talks with those in a position to offer a concrete solution rather than the hollow words we have been hearing from the mayor and his senior officials."" Andy Lord, TfL's chief operating officer,said: ""We haven't proposed any changes to pensions or terms and conditions, and nobody has lost or will lose their jobs because of the proposals we have set out, so this action is completely unnecessary. ""We know our customers deserve better than this continued disruption and that is why we're urging the RMT to talk to us so we can find a resolution to this dispute which has already damaged London's recovery from the pandemic."" It doesn't seem there will be a resolution any time soon.  Sarah LeeBBC London Commuters face a fourth day of travel misery on Friday due to the knock-on impact of today's strike by 10,000 Tube workers. Transport for London (TfL) is warning that no Tube is expected to run until 08:00 GMT on Friday, similar to Wednesday morning after Tuesday's strike, with further disruption likely through the day. The RMT union's executive will meet to decide its next move in the bitter row, with further stoppages not being ruled out. Picket lines have been mounted outside Tube stations today and the union said its members were showing ""magnificent"" support for the industrial action. There were long queues again for buses and taxis, although not as bad as on Tuesday, as many people decided to work from home rather than spend hours trying to get to and from offices. Olivia DemetriadesBBC London Here are some of the travellers we've spoken to today... Here's the latest at the top of the hour, as 10,000 Tube workers strike and bring most London Underground lines to a standstill: No 10 has urged both sides in the Tube strikes to ""get around the table"" to resolve the issues at hand. Prime Minister Boris Johnson's official spokesman said: ""I think these ongoing strikes clearly are bringing misery to many Londoners, and we want both sides to get around the table and put an end to this disruptive action. ""It's a blow to businesses as they recover from Covid restrictions and it's stopping people from getting to work."" Transport for London (TfL) is already warning Londoners to prepare for more disruption to journeys tomorrow morning following todayâs Tube strike. Allow Twitter content?

Seven lines are now completely suspended, according to Transport for London (TfL). A little earlier, the Bakerloo Line began running a reduced service between Queen's Park and Elephant & Castle, but it seems that has now been suspended again. TfL'slive status page,externalsuggests only four lines are running infrequent services outside of central London. TfL Rail and trams are running as normal but Docklands Light Railway services are partly suspended. London Overground was already running a reduced service this week. Helen HoddinottJournalist Sisters Chi Chi and Chioma are at King's Cross waiting for an Uber to Covent Garden where they were hoping to take the Tube three stops to return some clothes. Chi Chioma says: ""The woman at the station said [the strikes] are because of poor working conditions and pay and stuff so I guess itâs fair enough but itâs a bit inconvenient as well."" Chi Chi says: ""We had to walk from the station, we were waiting for the bus, but it was so full, off the get go, loads of people just flocking to buses and I didnât really think it was Covid safe, so we just booked an Uber instead. But the traffic is quite bad so itâs been stuck on the same time for the last 10 or 15 minutes maybe. It was pricey, about Â£20."" Do the sisters have any sympathy for those on the picket line? ""I kind of get it, like itâs inconvenient for us,"" Chi Chi adds ""but itâs inconvenience for them as well because theyâre trying to work a job to get paid but theyâre still not being met with fair treatment so itâs understandable to be honest.""

"The aftermath of an attack in Kharkiv - dead bodies have been blurred. Weapons experts say it's likely cluster bombs were used in the strike Russia has been accused of using cluster bombs in Ukraine - and the International Criminal Court (ICC) has opened an investigation into possible war crimes. We've looked at social media videos and open-source material to detail the evidence around one attack in particular. On 28 February Andriy (not his real name) was having a shower in his flat in Kharkiv when he heard loud explosions outside. ""I had to quickly dry myself, lying on the wet floor in a shaking house and listening to the sound of breaking glass."" The windows in his flat cracked and when he looked outside, several people were lying on the floor. It was clear at least one of them was dead. They had been waiting by a water dispenser in the street which Andriy himself had visited just minutes before. Kharkiv's mayor later confirmed four people were killed. The BBC has analysed footage and spoken to eyewitnesses and experts to find out more about the attack - just one of several in the current conflict that allegedly involved cluster munitions in residential areas. Images from the aftermath of the attack show bodies - blurred out in this photo - lying near a water dispenser News of the event was first posted on Twitter at 13:06 local time. A video showed explosions and plumes of black smoke. Another video, posted soon after, showed the aftermath, with people motionless on the floor. By identifying some key features - such as the water dispenser and a shoe repair shop - we can confirm the incident took place in a northern area of Kharkiv. There were multiple reports of Russian shelling on that day. We've also been sent further footage, shot around the same time of day but from further down the street, 23 Serpnya Lane. (The name of the street is a reference to 23 August 1943, when the city was liberated from German Nazi forces.) Timestamped 12:46, the footage is filmed from inside a car driving towards the incident. As it turns into 23 Serpnya Lane, there is a succession of quick explosions, and one person falls to the ground. We showed these clips to four weapons experts, including Sam Cranny-Evans, a research analyst at the Royal United Services Institute, a defence think tank. He says the car footage is consistent with a cluster bomb attack as it shows ""lots of small explosions in a relatively small area"". Cluster munitions are rockets or missiles that deploy a large number of small explosives. Usually they are fired from the ground, and as the projectile reaches its target, it opens up and disperses all its bomblets. Weapons intelligence specialist Pete Norton agrees that the evidence ""correlates with the use of sub-munitions"" - the individual bomblets in a cluster weapon. Norton notes that the explosions in the video are ""relatively small charges"". We also showed experts footage of the same attack from a different angle. They suggested a combination of rockets and cluster munitions appeared to have been used. A still from camera footage obtained by the BBC, which shows several explosions along 23 Serpnya Lane The use of cluster munitions has been criticised by human rights groups and some governments. When bomblets are released they scatter over wide areas, potentially harming people nearby. There's also danger in the aftermath. According to Mr Cranny-Evans, a rocket launcher can deploy up to 7,000 cluster bombs and usually about 2% of them don't detonate. These unexploded bomblets can kill or maim civilians long after a conflict has ended, and are costly to locate and remove. Over 100 countries are part of an international treaty which bans the making or use of these weapons, but Russia and Ukraine are not signed up and both have cluster munitions. The Kremlin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov denied the use of these weapons on Tuesday. Russia has been widely accused of hitting civilian targets deliberately, but in the case of the water dispenser attack, investigators from Amnesty International believe it's theoretically possible that there was an intention to strike the nearby headquarters of a company called XADO. The building is on the same street from which Andriy witnessed the attack. XADO is a chemical company that is also understood to have made rifles. But there's no suggestion there was any manufacturing going on in the headquarters building, which is in a residential area. Even if XADO was the target, experts think cluster bombs should not have been used. ""If it was a target that was considered so important that it needed a missile strike to be launched against it, you would use a missile with a unitary high explosive warhead,"" says Mr Cranny-Evans. ""A cluster munition is devastating and psychologically traumatic, but is ultimately ineffective if the people are inside a building. If you want to destroy a building you need a lot of high explosives, not lots of little explosions."" The BBC has contacted the Russian embassy in London for comment.

UKRAINE:'I have never felt so much love for my homeland' IN DEPTH:Full coverage of the conflict The evidence points clearly to the attack in question being carried out by Russian forces.

Amnesty International investigators contacted the individual who took the images, and said they were sent more images from the scene of the attack. We've reviewed the images and have also seen damaged vehicles and shots of the wider area in which the cluster sub-munition was found. Metadata contained in the images confirms a creation date of 28 February. The writing on the image of the cluster sub-munition above shows that it was made in Russia in 2019, according to Amnesty. The investigators say Russia stopped selling such weapons to Ukraine in 2012. We also looked at evidence of other alleged cluster bomb attacks. For instance, video footage geolocated by the BBC shows a series of explosions in a north-eastern neighbourhood of Kharkiv, close to a shopping centre. Weapons experts have suggested these explosions are also consistent with cluster attacks. Plumes of smoke can be seem rising after several explosions in a Kharkiv neighbourhood Images have also emerged of an attack on a kindergarten in the town of Okhtyrka. The incident killed six people, including a child, according to the city's mayor. Before and after the attack, there were several reports on social media that Russian troops were in the area. Pictures of the aftermath show bloodied bodies laying out the ground nearby, and holes in the roof of the building that are consistent with cluster bomblets, many experts say. Reporters at open-source intelligence group Bellingcat geolocated a cluster munitions warhead which they believe was fired by a BM-27 rocket launcher based approximately 200m east of the kindergarten. That attack led the foreign minister of Ukraine, Dmytro Kuleba, to accuse Russia of committing war crimes. A number of Western leaders have made similar allegations, and the International Criminal Court has opened an investigation into the claims. Russia faces war crimes investigation over Ukraine Under international law, only military targets can be attacked. The BBC spoke to Noam Lubell, a professor of international law at Essex University and showed him footage of the attacks. He said it raises serious concerns. The first thing to consider is the intended target and the precautions taken to avoid civilian harm. Even if the intended target had been military in the Kharkiv water dispenser attack, Prof Lubell says, the attack could still be unlawful when it is in a civilian area. The means and methods of attack must be considered, as well as whether the expected harm to civilians outweighs the military advantage. Prof Lubell added that ""using explosive munitions that cause damage across a wide area in an urban environment is highly likely to fall foul of the prohibition on indiscriminate attacks, and at the very least warrants an investigation into possible violations of international humanitarian law"". Philippe Sands, professor of law at University College London, said that the scale of civilian casualties witnessed during the latest conflict in Ukraine suggests some intentionality. ""Just as I've been watching it from day one, there have been consistent and regular reports of civilian objectives being targeted, either intentionally or otherwise, on a scale that suggests that this is maybe intentional."" He added: ""The impression that's been given us is that there is an effort to terrify the population."" As for Andriy, he and his family are now hiding in the basement of a private nursery. But even below ground, they cannot escape the constant sound of shelling.

"UK sanctions against some individuals linked to Vladimir Putin could take weeks to put together, government sources have told the BBC. Several Russian oligarchs have had their UK assets frozen and there is pressure on ministers to extend this punishment to more people. But a government source said sanctions would be a rolling package that would ""gradually tighten the ratchet"". Meanwhile, Labour is calling for oligarchs' UK assets to be seized. It argues that confiscating possessions like jewellery, designer clothes, cars and property will boost the current sanctions regime. And Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat, the chairman of the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee, said: ""We should be looking immediately to seize those assets linked to those who are profiting from Putin's war machine, holding it in trust and returning it to the Russian people as soon as possible."" Will new legal powers find Putin's loot? Russian oligarchs' super yachts seized Abramovich must face sanctions, says Starmer Since Russia invaded Ukraine last week, ministers have frozen the UK bank accounts and other assets of some wealthy Russians - including Mr Putin and some of those linked to him - plus those of some large firms. Government insiders believe targeting banks or financial institutions will have a bigger impact than penalising individual high-profile oligarchs. Meanwhile, the authorities in France and Germany have seized super yachts owned by Russian tycoons Igor Sechin and Alisher Usmanov. For Labour, shadow foreign secretary David Lammy said the UK's sanctions regime against individuals must ""catch up with [those of] our allies and partners"", adding: ""The government must get a grip on this by cutting Putin and those linked to his rogue regime out of our economic system as fast as possible."" David Lammy says the UK government has failed to keep pace with its international allies over sanctions At Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said billionaire Roman Abramovich, who owns Chelsea Football Club, should face sanctions and accused Mr Johnson of being slow to target individuals who ""prop up"" Mr Putin's regime. But a spokesman for Mr Abramovich, who has previously denied having close financial ties with the Russian president or the Kremlin, and who is now selling the football club, said he had done nothing sanctionable. Who's in Putin's inner circle and running the war? Did the UK sanction 100 people last week? Who is not on the UK sanctions list? On Wednesday, Boris Johnson promised to publish a list of oligarchs with ""ill-gotten Russian loot"", but did not specify when this would happen. The government's Economic Crime Bill will be debated in detail by MPs next week, with Labour saying it will help fast track the legislation. Among other measures, it will force anonymous foreign owners of UK property to reveal their identities to prevent criminals hiding behind secretive shell companies. But the measure will not come into effect for existing property owners for 18 months after it becomes law, which Labour says will give those targeted plenty of time to hide their assets. The government has said it will shorten this ""grace period"" but not by how much, when MPs debate it on Monday. But Labour says this ""vague"" promise is not enough, and it should be shortened to 28 days. ""We cannot give oligarchs a head start. Dirty Russian money must be taken out of the UK in days, not months,"" said shadow business secretary Jonathan Reynolds.

"Volunteers in Northampton sort donations before loading them into a lorry destined for Ukraine. Across the UK, people have been donating clothes, bedding and toiletries toaround one million Ukrainians,externalwho have fled the country since Russia invaded, as well as those in need in the country. Collection points have been set up everywhere from beauty salons to supermarket car parks. The generosity has been so great that some organisers have had to limit what they are willing to take in, or refuse them altogether. Some charities are asking for cash donations instead, as it bypasses the need to transport donations hundreds of miles, and cash can reach people quickly to buy what is needed. In Barton in North Yorkshire, Marta Libera is particularly worried about the women and children who have lost their homes. She told the BBC she has been collecting nappies, wipes and baby formula to send to Poland, her home country. What can people in the UK do to help Ukraine? Appeal to help refugees from war in Ukraine She's not alone. In Hartlepool, volunteers have been collecting donations from members of the community who want to help. In a community hub, they are sorted through and categorised by a team of volunteers. Collection points like these have sprung up everywhere. In Halifax, the furniture in a residential home lounge is barely visible under bags stuffed with warm clothing. Donations have been collected in car parks like this one outside a supermarket in Northampton. These hubs look very different across the country. Donations have been collected in car parks like this one. Outside a supermarket in Northampton, volunteers have been loading essential goods and clothing into a van that will be driven to Ukraine. At Sweetcheeks Beauty Salon in Dawley, Telford, manager Rachel Evans has traded in her day job to help a Ukrainian colleague who wants to get supplies to those who need them. One lot of donations has already been sent, she told BBC Radio Shropshire - including period products, nappies, clothing and bedding. One man even brought in a tent and gazebo. ""It's been phenomenal really, the response we've had,"" she added. The quantity has been so great that one location near Leeds visited by the BBC on Thursday had asked people to stop donating altogether. At the White Eagle club in London, over 100 volunteers have been sorting through masses of bags. Magda Harvey, one of the organisers,told the BBCpeople queued for an hour and a half to give donations. ""We've got so many offers of free transport, whole trucks. We are loading truck after truck,"" she said. The club is working with international charities to keep an updated list of what is needed to avoid unwanted donations. ""Ukrainians that have fled the country, they lost everything,"" Ms Harvey adds. ""They left everything behind.

"Svetlana said she was overwhelmed to have her mum with her in Northern Ireland A Ukrainian woman has been reunited with her daughter in Northern Ireland after making an emotional journey from the war-torn country. Svetlana Murphy, who is originally from Ukraine, has lived in Northern Ireland for years. She was reunited with her mother Galina Korol at Dublin Airport before travelling to NI on Thursday. ""I just can't believe it, it is just overwhelming and I am so happy she is here now,"" Svetlana said. ""I have got her, so I'm not going to let her go."" Galina arrived from Lublin in Poland, which she had made her way to from Dnipro in Ukraine after four days of travelling. The journey was facilitated by a chance conversation between her future son-in-law Mel Campbell and Aneta Gil, a Polish waitress at Gowdy's pub near Lisburn. This video can not be played Svetlana Murphy and her mother Galina Korol were reunited at Dublin Airport. Aneta was able to help by getting friends to drive three-and-a-half hours each way to collect Galina from a refugee camp on the Poland-Ukraine border and drive her into Poland. ""Svetlana was sending me the locations of her mum, so I was passing this to my friend, it was all about communication,"" Aneta said. Aneta told BBC News NI it was an emotional moment when Svetlana and Galina came into Gowdy's after being reunited. ""When I saw, of course, it made me cry,"" she said. ""I'm so happy I could help, that I had a chance to help, I'm so happy. Aneta helped to plan Galina's journey from the Polish border Mel said they had booked a flight for last Saturday night, hotels for three nights and a flight for Wednesday night for Galina, knowing that the circumstances could change quickly. ""We just booked flights and hotels, that if she got there, she'd have somewhere to go,"" he said. ""We pre-empted the plan of action and hoped that it would fall into place and with the amazing help of Aneta and her family friends, everything fell into place. ""It was amazing and testament to the Polish people and Aneta's family especially, and the effort that Galina put in. ""She's in her early 60s, you know, that takes a lot of guts to get up and leave your home, to travel with pretty much no possessions and being driven by strangers, crossing your fingers and hoping that things fall into place, that the gods are looking down on you."" Mel Campbell said Galina had shown courage to make the journey Svetlana revealed that her mother would be there for her wedding to Mel. ""I'm just so happy, I'll have my mum close to me on a special day for us and it's just the best present ever,"" she said. She was also asked what her mother wanted to say and translated for her as Galina does not speak fluent English. ""She said: 'I want to say thank you to everyone who helped and my kids, what they did for me - I can see my kids, my grandchildren growing up, I can live, I can breathe',"" Svetlana said. Galina will be able to attend her daughter's wedding Russia invaded Ukraine eight days ago and the city of Mariupol is now under siege. Earlier, the port of Kherson became the first major city to be taken by Russian forces. ""She [Galina] knows it's a war and I am not afraid to use that word because loads of people are dying,"" Svetlana said earlier on Thursday. Russian troops take control of key Ukrainian city Russia faces war crimes investigation over Ukraine Where have the million Ukrainian refugees gone? ""The explosions are really frightening and I just begged her to get away from it, because she has family here and we need her."" On Thursday, the Irish Department of Justice confirmed 450 Ukrainian nationals had arrived into Dublin Airport between 25 February, when visa requirements were removed, and 2 March. A spokesperson said a temporary protection directive to allow officials to ""quickly and humanely respond to the mass displacement of Ukrainian people by Russian aggression"" was agreed on Thursday and is expected to be adopted on Friday. ""It will provide an immediate right of access to the labour market, housing, social welfare, healthcare, education, training and other supports,"" the department said. By Sara Girvan, BBC Newsline reporter All over Northern Ireland, friends and family members of people stuck in Ukraine, are waiting for news from their loved ones. In Newry, County Down, members of the Ukrainian community are gathering aid to send back to their homeland. Elena Bushtruk's daughter Anna fled Kyiv and has made it to the Romanian border, but she hopes her daughter will soon join her in Northern Ireland. Speaking through a translator, Elena said: ""Of course I am worried. Elena Bushtruk says it has been ""very hard"" waiting on news of her daughter ""I hope that she gets here, and I hope that it's soon."" Mariya Krupska's home has become a hub for the local Ukrainian community. Her house is fit to burst with donations from people in Newry. This weekend, she plans to fill a truck with them and drive them to the Polish border with Ukraine. ""I'm not scared because it's a little thing that I can do,"" she said. ""At least I can do this. Mariya Krupska is driving aid donations to the Poland-Ukraine border ""People don't have a roof, people don't have food, people have their houses ruined. ""My heart is in pieces - I didn't sleep for maybe four nights at all. ""My family is in the west and they are safe for now but something will happen if this is not stopped. ""I have a lot of friends in Kyiv, in Odesa, in Kharkiv, in Sumy. They are all in big massive danger."" Every morning, Natasha Stokes waits for updates from her friends and family members in Kyiv. Natasha Stokes has asked people to pray for those in Ukraine ""The messages don't always get through,"" she said. She told the BBC: ""I feel empty. I'm a very private and reserved person in my ordinary life, but I am a religious person. ""I'm so overwhelmed with grief and worry. I just want to ask people in Northern Ireland, it doesn't matter what beliefs they have, what religion they have. ""Every night when you go to bed, please say a word of prayer for people in Kyiv, for people in Ukraine. ""Please pray they will be alive in the morning."" Russia has for the first time admitted suffering heavy military casualties during its attack on Ukraine, with 498 troops killed and a further 1,597 injured. However Ukraine says Russian losses run into the thousands. Ukraine reports that more than 2,000 civilians have died since the invasion began last Thursday. The conflict has also caused more than a million people to flee Ukraine, according to the UN. Where have Ukraine's millions of refugees gone?

"Nearly all services have been affected due to a second 24-hour strike this week No Tube service is expected before 08:00 GMT on Friday, TfL says The first strike on Tuesday resulted in all London Underground lines being hit About 10,000 London Underground workers from the RMT union have walked out in a dispute is over pensions, jobs and working conditions Anna Lindsay and Sarah Lee Londoners look for other means of transport as the second Tube strike this week causes travel misery. Sarah LeeBBC London And with that, that's all from us here at BBC London this evening. We're off to try and find a bus. Over and out! Helen HoddinottJournalist I've just spoken to a commuter at King's Cross, Annette, who told me she is carrying on with her evening plans in central London, despite the strike. ""I'm meeting some friends for dinner tonight in Soho,"" she tells me. ""I would normally get there from on the Northern Line to Leicester Square and then walk. ""But today I got the overground and I'm just trying work out how to get there from Kings Cross. ""It's a bit bleak at the moment but I'm sure I'll get there at some point."" The picture is worsening this evening. All Tubes lines are now completely suspended except the Central Line, according to Transport for London (TfL). The Central Line has a limited service between Loughton and Liverpool Street, between Newbury Park and Liverpool Street via Hainault, and between White City and Ealing Broadway/West Ruislip. DLR and London Overground have reduced services. Tom EdwardsTransport Correspondent, BBC London So where have two days of strikes and what will be, by tomorrow, four days of disruption got us? What has changed? Not much. Undoubtedly the RMT union has made its point, by closing the Tube, that it takes the threat to pensions very seriously. But has that led to a rethink by Transport for London (TfL) chiefs? No. TfL has to carry out the pension review as part of the emergency funding it received from central government. It is going to happen and is set to report back on 31 March. The worry for commuters is the dispute could actually escalate. The other Tube drivers' union Aslef might not like the pension proposals, so it, too, could strike. Both sides in this are bound to their positions - the unions by their members and TfL by the funding settlement. Could the government change the funding? Very unlikely. So I think this could just be the beginning. Helen HoddinottJournalist All the entrances to the underground at King's Cross have been gated off ahead of the evening rush hour. Outside of the station, people are waiting for the buses, but one bus did not stop and would not let anyone else on - it was that crammed. I saw a bus on the other side of the road heading towards central London, which is also looking very packed - there is a bit of a crowd waiting there. People I've spoken to say they are determined to head into central London for their Thursday evening plans. The taxi rank has about 40 people waiting in front of it at the moment. Night is finally falling on the second 24-hour Tube strike. Today has felt less chaotic than Tuesday as people have seemed to have planned accordingly. BBC London For a full round-up of today's Tube strike tune into BBC One,or click on iPlayer,from 18:35 GMT to watch BBC London analyse what has been happening today and what is expected for tomorrow. BBC London's Transport Correspondent Tom Edwards will have all the latest. Tom EdwardsTransport Correspondent, BBC London This is a red hot issue for the unions. The other unions - Aslef and the TSSA - also do not want changes to the pension. The government has said the mayor should present a report on how to make the pension scheme ""financially sustainable"" by the end of March. The funding document says: ""As part of the review of TfL's pension scheme, TfL will deliver a final report, including a recommended approach and implementation plan by no later than 31 March 2022."" It feels more like the beginning than the end of this dispute and that means more strikes are likely. Not much has changed in the past hour - the strike by 10,000 Tube workers is continuing to cause chaos for travellers in the capital this rush hour: The RMT union representing the 10,000 Tube workers on strike fears spending cuts linked to a funding deal by the government will lead to hundreds of job losses, reduced pensions and worse working conditions. RMT general secretary Mick Lynchsaid: ""The fight goes on and our executive will consider the next steps in the campaign. ""We remain available for talks with those in a position to offer a concrete solution rather than the hollow words we have been hearing from the mayor and his senior officials."" Andy Lord, TfL's chief operating officer,said: ""We haven't proposed any changes to pensions or terms and conditions, and nobody has lost or will lose their jobs because of the proposals we have set out, so this action is completely unnecessary. ""We know our customers deserve better than this continued disruption and that is why we're urging the RMT to talk to us so we can find a resolution to this dispute which has already damaged London's recovery from the pandemic."" It doesn't seem there will be a resolution any time soon.  Sarah LeeBBC London Commuters face a fourth day of travel misery on Friday due to the knock-on impact of today's strike by 10,000 Tube workers. Transport for London (TfL) is warning that no Tube is expected to run until 08:00 GMT on Friday, similar to Wednesday morning after Tuesday's strike, with further disruption likely through the day. The RMT union's executive will meet to decide its next move in the bitter row, with further stoppages not being ruled out. Picket lines have been mounted outside Tube stations today and the union said its members were showing ""magnificent"" support for the industrial action. There were long queues again for buses and taxis, although not as bad as on Tuesday, as many people decided to work from home rather than spend hours trying to get to and from offices. Olivia DemetriadesBBC London Here are some of the travellers we've spoken to today... Here's the latest at the top of the hour, as 10,000 Tube workers strike and bring most London Underground lines to a standstill: No 10 has urged both sides in the Tube strikes to ""get around the table"" to resolve the issues at hand. Prime Minister Boris Johnson's official spokesman said: ""I think these ongoing strikes clearly are bringing misery to many Londoners, and we want both sides to get around the table and put an end to this disruptive action. ""It's a blow to businesses as they recover from Covid restrictions and it's stopping people from getting to work."" Transport for London (TfL) is already warning Londoners to prepare for more disruption to journeys tomorrow morning following todayâs Tube strike. Allow Twitter content?

Helen HoddinottJournalist Sisters Chi Chi and Chioma are at King's Cross waiting for an Uber to Covent Garden where they were hoping to take the Tube three stops to return some clothes. Chi Chioma says: ""The woman at the station said [the strikes] are because of poor working conditions and pay and stuff so I guess itâs fair enough but itâs a bit inconvenient as well."" Chi Chi says: ""We had to walk from the station, we were waiting for the bus, but it was so full, off the get go, loads of people just flocking to buses and I didnât really think it was Covid safe, so we just booked an Uber instead. But the traffic is quite bad so itâs been stuck on the same time for the last 10 or 15 minutes maybe. It was pricey, about Â£20."" Do the sisters have any sympathy for those on the picket line? ""I kind of get it, like itâs inconvenient for us,"" Chi Chi adds ""but itâs inconvenience for them as well because theyâre trying to work a job to get paid but theyâre still not being met with fair treatment so itâs understandable to be honest.""

"Rosneft boss Igor Sechin's yacht Amore Vero - meaning ""true love"" - has been seized French authorities have seized a super yacht owned by an oligarch as part of the sanctions against Russia. A yacht owned by Igor Sechin, boss of Russian state energy company Rosneft, was grabbed by French customs officers near Marseille. However, German authorities denieda report,externalthat they had seized a $600m vessel owned by Russian metal tycoon Alisher Usmanov in Hamburg. On Thursday, Mr Usmanov was one oftwo more Russians sanctioned by the UK. The BBC understands that some oligarchs sanctioned by the European Union are ""shocked"" to find their debit cards no longer function, and they are now relying on using cash from safes. The French acted quickly on Wednesday when customs officers noticed that Mr Sechin's 88-metre ""Amore Vero"" - which translates as ""true love"" - was ""taking steps to sail off urgently"". UK must target Putin's Mayfair lifestyle, says Labour It arrived in in the Mediterranean port of La Ciotat in January and had been due to stay there while being repaired until 1 April. It has also been reported that yachts belonging to five other Russian billionaires were heading to the Maldives, regarded as a safe home because it does not have an extradition treaty with the US. The move by France came as the Prime Minister's official spokesman rejected claims that the UK has been slower at introducing sanctions than the EU or that legal hold-ups are preventing sanctions on Russian oligarchs. He reiterated the UK's position that it was better to prioritise the measures that had the biggest economic impact, rather than targeting individuals just because they were well known. Some oligarchs have been sanctioned by the government, which means their UK bank accounts are frozen and access to funds denied. But others are taking advantage of any delay in adding them to its list. A lawyer told the BBC that wealthy Russians were looking to move their money out of the UK before being hit by sanctions. ""The government has softened the blow by giving [wealthy Russians] time to move their money out,"" lawyer Nigel Kushner of W Legal told the BBC. Speaking to the Today programme, he said: ""Clients have been asking: 'Can I move my money out before I'm on the list?' I will say yes, that's perfectly legitimate."" The government's list of Russians sanctioned includes 195 individuals, but most predate the invasion of Ukraine. Since the start of the war just 15 Russians have been added to the sanctions list, including President Vladimir Putin. Security Minister Damian Hinds told the BBC that the wealth of Russian oligarchs with British investments would not prevent the UK Government from ""going after"" them. ""There will be more individuals (who) can be sanctioned,"" he told BBC Breakfast. ""We will be going after people as needed."" Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said legal threats would not prevent the UK government sanctioning Russian oligarchs. In an interview in Lithuania, she said: ""We have to make sure we have the right evidence to put in place those sanctions. ""We will continue to work through our list, we will continue to sanction oligarchs and there is nowhere for any of Putin's cronies to hide."" Energy bills could reach Â£3,000 as oil price soars Growing numbers of firms pull back from Russia What sanctions could West still impose on Russia? Meanwhile, the London Stock Exchange (LSE) has suspended the shares of 28 Russian-linked companies because of sanctions introduced following the invasion of Ukraine. They include green energy and metals company En+ Group run by US-sanctioned oligarch Oleg Deripaska, which is chaired by Conservative peer and former energy minister Greg Barker. The decision to suspend the listings ""has been based on sanctions and the ability to run an orderly market,"" said LSE chief executive David Schwimmer. ""If we see any other securities affected by sanctions then similar actions will take place."" Last week, a subsidiary of Russia's second largest bank, VTB, was suspended on the LSE as a result of sanctions. However, a number of Russian companies, including Roman Abramovich-backed Evraz, continue to trade on the stock market despite criticism from politicians. New economic sanctions have also been announced to stop Russian aviation and space companies getting access to the UK insurance market. The move will limit the benefits Russian businesses can receive from their access to the global insurance and reinsurance market through Lloyd's, the world's biggest insurance market.

"UK sanctions against some individuals linked to Vladimir Putin could take weeks to put together, government sources have told the BBC. Several Russian oligarchs have had their UK assets frozen and there is pressure on ministers to extend this punishment to more people. But a government source said sanctions would be a rolling package that would ""gradually tighten the ratchet"". Meanwhile, Labour is calling for oligarchs' UK assets to be seized. It argues that confiscating possessions like jewellery, designer clothes, cars and property will boost the current sanctions regime. And Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat, the chairman of the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee, said: ""We should be looking immediately to seize those assets linked to those who are profiting from Putin's war machine, holding it in trust and returning it to the Russian people as soon as possible."" Will new legal powers find Putin's loot? Russian oligarchs' super yachts seized Abramovich must face sanctions, says Starmer Since Russia invaded Ukraine last week, ministers have frozen the UK bank accounts and other assets of some wealthy Russians - including Mr Putin and some of those linked to him - plus those of some large firms. Government insiders believe targeting banks or financial institutions will have a bigger impact than penalising individual high-profile oligarchs. Meanwhile, the authorities in France and Germany have seized super yachts owned by Russian tycoons Igor Sechin and Alisher Usmanov. For Labour, shadow foreign secretary David Lammy said the UK's sanctions regime against individuals must ""catch up with [those of] our allies and partners"", adding: ""The government must get a grip on this by cutting Putin and those linked to his rogue regime out of our economic system as fast as possible."" David Lammy says the UK government has failed to keep pace with its international allies over sanctions At Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said billionaire Roman Abramovich, who owns Chelsea Football Club, should face sanctions and accused Mr Johnson of being slow to target individuals who ""prop up"" Mr Putin's regime. But a spokesman for Mr Abramovich, who has previously denied having close financial ties with the Russian president or the Kremlin, and who is now selling the football club, said he had done nothing sanctionable. Who's in Putin's inner circle and running the war? Did the UK sanction 100 people last week? Who is not on the UK sanctions list? On Wednesday, Boris Johnson promised to publish a list of oligarchs with ""ill-gotten Russian loot"", but did not specify when this would happen. The government's Economic Crime Bill will be debated in detail by MPs next week, with Labour saying it will help fast track the legislation. Among other measures, it will force anonymous foreign owners of UK property to reveal their identities to prevent criminals hiding behind secretive shell companies. But the measure will not come into effect for existing property owners for 18 months after it becomes law, which Labour says will give those targeted plenty of time to hide their assets. The government has said it will shorten this ""grace period"" but not by how much, when MPs debate it on Monday. But Labour says this ""vague"" promise is not enough, and it should be shortened to 28 days. ""We cannot give oligarchs a head start. Dirty Russian money must be taken out of the UK in days, not months,"" said shadow business secretary Jonathan Reynolds.

"UK energy bills could reach as high as Â£3,000 a year as oil and gas prices surge amid the Ukraine conflict, the energy industry has said. Russia's invasion of Ukraine has made the trading, banking and shipping sectors reluctant to buy Russian commodities, pushing up prices. The price of Brent crude oil rose above $119 a barrel to the highest since May 2012, while gas prices rose as well. Average UK petrol prices have also hit a new record. The RAC said petrol reached Â£1.52 a litre for the first time, while diesel rose to a high of 155.79p. Russian oil and gas exports are exempted from Western sanctions for now, but the prospect of further action by the US and the EU is stifling Russian trade. Emma Pinchbeck, the chief executive of the energy industry body Energy UK, said: ""It's a really worrying time for both customers and industry. ""We've been saying since the autumn that we'd expect bills to go up again in October. With what we're seeing in Ukraine and in the oil and gas markets, we're now expecting those to go up further."" She said that if oil prices remain at elevated levels ""you can expect bills to be anywhere between Â£2,500 and Â£3,000 in October depending on the tariffs people have and what happens in the market"". The prices that people pay for energy and fuel depend on wholesale markets, which can go down as well as up. But average UK household energy bills are already set to rise to around Â£2,000 in Aprilwhen the price cap is increased. Will Russia's invasion push up gas bills? Energy bills set to soar but millions may get Â£200 help Gas prices had hit record highs last year due to colder winters which put pressure on supplies and reduced the amount of reserves countries had stored up. Ms Pinchbeck said: ""We have been saying for a long time this is an enduring crisis on the gas price and now that's being exacerbated by what's happening in Ukraine."" The RAC also warned that high fuel prices could be here to stay. RAC spokesman Simon Williams, said: ""What drivers pay at the pumps in the UK is determined by the cost of oil and the exchange rate as fuel, like oil, is traded in dollars."" He said with oil prices rising and the value of the pound at $1.33 ""further price rises are inevitable in the coming days and weeks"". Brent crude rose as a high as $119.84 a barrel at one point on Thursday, before sliding back to about $112. Meanwhile, European stock markets slipped as the Russian invasion continued. The UK's FTSE 100 share index closed down 2.5%, while the main markets in France and Germany ended down 1.8% and 2.1% respectively. Energy companies are sending emails to customers right now warning of price rises to hit in April - but these are a frozen picture. Bills are massively increasing as the price cap is going up by more than 50% and it is starting to feel real now, as people are now being told how much their individual direct debits will increase by. But those increases don't take account of what is currently taking place in Ukraine. The price cap is been raised every six month which means there is a half-year lag in protecting customers from immediate fluctuations on the global gas and oil markets. There was such huge pressure on the government to step in and act ahead of April's increase that they announced a package of extra help for households this time. It's not until the next price cap rise in October that we will feel the impact of the gas and oil spikes going on right now. The government will be under more pressure to help customers, and while for many households another energy price rise is unthinkable, there also seems to be a growing acceptance among consumers that the 'Putin Penalty' is one we will all have to shoulder to some extent. A government spokesperson said: ""It is hard to predict what longer term impacts the current situation in Ukraine will have on energy costs. ""However, the energy price cap will continue to insulate millions of customers from volatile global gas prices."" Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets.com, said oil traders were acting as though Russian energy exports had already been sanctioned, and were looking for other sources of oil. ""Self-sanctions are already playing a big role,"" he said. ""Shell, BP, Chevron are all exiting but traders and customers are swerving Russian oil without any sanctions needed."" ""European gas prices hit a record this morning. Coal prices are through the roof too,"" he said, adding there was ""nowhere to hide for European consumers about to get hit by a mega electricity bill and soaring inflation."" Average UK petrol prices have hit a fresh high Energy prices are pushing up the cost of living in the UK. The UK rate of inflation - which shows the cost of living - rose at a 30-year high of 5.5% in January and is expected to rise above 7% once the new energy price cap is introduced in the spring. Russia is the second biggest exporter of crude oil, and is also the world's largest natural gas exporter. Oil cartel Opec decided not to increase production further than already planned at a meeting on Wednesday, despite US calls to pump more oil. Ukraine and Russia are also two of the world's largest wheat producers, and account for nearly a third of global exports. Exports from the Black Sea have nearly halted amid the invasion of Ukraine and sanctions. Wheat prices jumped earlier in the week, but fell back on Thursday.

"The OneWeb satellites were due to be launched from the Baikonur spaceport OneWeb, the satellite company part-owned by the UK government, says it is suspending all launches from the Russian-operated Baikonur spaceport. The firm had hoped to send up 36 spacecraft on a Soyuz rocket from the Kazakhstan cosmodrome, but the mission has become embroiled in the fall-out over the invasion of Ukraine. Russia put down demands ahead of the flight that OneWeb could not meet. These included a guarantee that armed forces wouldn't use the satellites. Russia also wanted the UK government to divest itself of OneWeb shares, an ultimatum that was firmly rejected by Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng. UK rejects Russian demand to sell satellite share Stop rocket launch from Russian site, UK urged What sanctions are being imposed on Russia?

The board of OneWeb, which is headquartered in west London, voted on Thursday morning to suspend all future launches from Baikonur. It had been planning a series of flights from the cosmodrome this year to complete its broadband internet constellation in the sky. The firm will now be working with its French partner Arianespace, which organises Soyuz launches around the world, to find alternative rocket rides. This will be difficult, however. There is a dearth of available vehicles in the class needed by OneWeb. The company currently has 428 spacecraft in orbit. This is sufficient to provide space-borne internet connections above 50 degrees North (which includes the UK), but close to 650 satellites are required to run a truly global service. After OneWeb's announcement, Mr Kwarteng, whose department has a seat on the board, followed up with his own comments, tweeting: ""In light of Russia's illegal and unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, we are reviewing our participation in all further projects involving Russian collaboration."" This would appear to bring an end to the ""will it, won't"" confusion over whether the Soyuz rocket standing on the pad at Baikonur would actually launch on Friday. Allow Twitter content?

Mr Rogozin posted a video of pad workers on Wednesday covering up UK, US and Japanese flags When the vehicle, with 36 OneWeb satellites nestled under its nosecone, was rolled out by cosmodrome workers on Wednesday, it seemed that the flight was ""go!"". But then the head of the Russian space agency Roscosmos, Dimitry Rogozin, started to make demands before he would give the flight approval. These demands, he said, were a response to western sanctions imposed on Russia because of the war in Ukraine. First, he wanted assurances that OneWeb's system wouldn't be used for military purposes - an impossible ask given that UK and US forces are very keen to use the internet system. Then he wanted the ""hostile"" UK government to sell its shares in the company - instantly rebuffed by the business secretary. Mr Rogozin ended by posting a video of pad workers covering up UK, US and Japanese flags on the rocket's nosecone. Assuming Friday's planned launch is indeed cancelled, there arises the question of what happens to the 36 satellites. These remain the property of OneWeb, but it's unclear how they could be returned. There are currently no OneWeb staff in Baikonur to organise a shipment, even if Russia agreed to release the spacecraft. The company's manufacturing facility is in Florida where the production line can turn out two satellites a day, so they could quickly be replaced if alternative rockets are sourced. Mr Rogozin has already stated that money received in exchange for Soyuz rockets will not be given back. ""Due to force majeure circumstances that have arisen as a result of the aggressive policy of the West and the sanctions that are applied against Russia, this money will remain in Russia,"" he said.

"Nearly all services have been affected due to a second 24-hour strike this week No Tube service is expected before 08:00 GMT on Friday, TfL says The first strike on Tuesday resulted in all London Underground lines being hit About 10,000 London Underground workers from the RMT union have walked out in a dispute is over pensions, jobs and working conditions Anna Lindsay and Sarah Lee Londoners look for other means of transport as the second Tube strike this week causes travel misery. Sarah LeeBBC London And with that, that's all from us here at BBC London this evening. We're off to try and find a bus. Over and out! Helen HoddinottJournalist I've just spoken to a commuter at King's Cross, Annette, who told me she is carrying on with her evening plans in central London, despite the strike. ""I'm meeting some friends for dinner tonight in Soho,"" she tells me. ""I would normally get there from on the Northern Line to Leicester Square and then walk. ""But today I got the overground and I'm just trying work out how to get there from Kings Cross. ""It's a bit bleak at the moment but I'm sure I'll get there at some point."" The picture is worsening this evening. All Tubes lines are now completely suspended except the Central Line, according to Transport for London (TfL). The Central Line has a limited service between Loughton and Liverpool Street, between Newbury Park and Liverpool Street via Hainault, and between White City and Ealing Broadway/West Ruislip. DLR and London Overground have reduced services. Tom EdwardsTransport Correspondent, BBC London So where have two days of strikes and what will be, by tomorrow, four days of disruption got us? What has changed? Not much. Undoubtedly the RMT union has made its point, by closing the Tube, that it takes the threat to pensions very seriously. But has that led to a rethink by Transport for London (TfL) chiefs? No. TfL has to carry out the pension review as part of the emergency funding it received from central government. It is going to happen and is set to report back on 31 March. The worry for commuters is the dispute could actually escalate. The other Tube drivers' union Aslef might not like the pension proposals, so it, too, could strike. Both sides in this are bound to their positions - the unions by their members and TfL by the funding settlement. Could the government change the funding? Very unlikely. So I think this could just be the beginning. Helen HoddinottJournalist All the entrances to the underground at King's Cross have been gated off ahead of the evening rush hour. Outside of the station, people are waiting for the buses, but one bus did not stop and would not let anyone else on - it was that crammed. I saw a bus on the other side of the road heading towards central London, which is also looking very packed - there is a bit of a crowd waiting there. People I've spoken to say they are determined to head into central London for their Thursday evening plans. The taxi rank has about 40 people waiting in front of it at the moment. Night is finally falling on the second 24-hour Tube strike. Today has felt less chaotic than Tuesday as people have seemed to have planned accordingly. BBC London For a full round-up of today's Tube strike tune into BBC One,or click on iPlayer,from 18:35 GMT to watch BBC London analyse what has been happening today and what is expected for tomorrow. BBC London's Transport Correspondent Tom Edwards will have all the latest. Tom EdwardsTransport Correspondent, BBC London This is a red hot issue for the unions. The other unions - Aslef and the TSSA - also do not want changes to the pension. The government has said the mayor should present a report on how to make the pension scheme ""financially sustainable"" by the end of March. The funding document says: ""As part of the review of TfL's pension scheme, TfL will deliver a final report, including a recommended approach and implementation plan by no later than 31 March 2022."" It feels more like the beginning than the end of this dispute and that means more strikes are likely. Not much has changed in the past hour - the strike by 10,000 Tube workers is continuing to cause chaos for travellers in the capital this rush hour: The RMT union representing the 10,000 Tube workers on strike fears spending cuts linked to a funding deal by the government will lead to hundreds of job losses, reduced pensions and worse working conditions. RMT general secretary Mick Lynchsaid: ""The fight goes on and our executive will consider the next steps in the campaign. ""We remain available for talks with those in a position to offer a concrete solution rather than the hollow words we have been hearing from the mayor and his senior officials."" Andy Lord, TfL's chief operating officer,said: ""We haven't proposed any changes to pensions or terms and conditions, and nobody has lost or will lose their jobs because of the proposals we have set out, so this action is completely unnecessary. ""We know our customers deserve better than this continued disruption and that is why we're urging the RMT to talk to us so we can find a resolution to this dispute which has already damaged London's recovery from the pandemic."" It doesn't seem there will be a resolution any time soon.  Sarah LeeBBC London Commuters face a fourth day of travel misery on Friday due to the knock-on impact of today's strike by 10,000 Tube workers. Transport for London (TfL) is warning that no Tube is expected to run until 08:00 GMT on Friday, similar to Wednesday morning after Tuesday's strike, with further disruption likely through the day. The RMT union's executive will meet to decide its next move in the bitter row, with further stoppages not being ruled out. Picket lines have been mounted outside Tube stations today and the union said its members were showing ""magnificent"" support for the industrial action. There were long queues again for buses and taxis, although not as bad as on Tuesday, as many people decided to work from home rather than spend hours trying to get to and from offices. Olivia DemetriadesBBC London Here are some of the travellers we've spoken to today... Here's the latest at the top of the hour, as 10,000 Tube workers strike and bring most London Underground lines to a standstill: No 10 has urged both sides in the Tube strikes to ""get around the table"" to resolve the issues at hand. Prime Minister Boris Johnson's official spokesman said: ""I think these ongoing strikes clearly are bringing misery to many Londoners, and we want both sides to get around the table and put an end to this disruptive action. ""It's a blow to businesses as they recover from Covid restrictions and it's stopping people from getting to work."" Transport for London (TfL) is already warning Londoners to prepare for more disruption to journeys tomorrow morning following todayâs Tube strike. Allow Twitter content?

Chi Chioma says: ""The woman at the station said [the strikes] are because of poor working conditions and pay and stuff so I guess itâs fair enough but itâs a bit inconvenient as well."" Chi Chi says: ""We had to walk from the station, we were waiting for the bus, but it was so full, off the get go, loads of people just flocking to buses and I didnât really think it was Covid safe, so we just booked an Uber instead. But the traffic is quite bad so itâs been stuck on the same time for the last 10 or 15 minutes maybe. It was pricey, about Â£20."" Do the sisters have any sympathy for those on the picket line? ""I kind of get it, like itâs inconvenient for us,"" Chi Chi adds ""but itâs inconvenience for them as well because theyâre trying to work a job to get paid but theyâre still not being met with fair treatment so itâs understandable to be honest.""

"The aftermath of an attack in Kharkiv - dead bodies have been blurred. Weapons experts say it's likely cluster bombs were used in the strike Russia has been accused of using cluster bombs in Ukraine - and the International Criminal Court (ICC) has opened an investigation into possible war crimes. We've looked at social media videos and open-source material to detail the evidence around one attack in particular. On 28 February Andriy (not his real name) was having a shower in his flat in Kharkiv when he heard loud explosions outside. ""I had to quickly dry myself, lying on the wet floor in a shaking house and listening to the sound of breaking glass."" The windows in his flat cracked and when he looked outside, several people were lying on the floor. It was clear at least one of them was dead. They had been waiting by a water dispenser in the street which Andriy himself had visited just minutes before. Kharkiv's mayor later confirmed four people were killed. The BBC has analysed footage and spoken to eyewitnesses and experts to find out more about the attack - just one of several in the current conflict that allegedly involved cluster munitions in residential areas. Images from the aftermath of the attack show bodies - blurred out in this photo - lying near a water dispenser News of the event was first posted on Twitter at 13:06 local time. A video showed explosions and plumes of black smoke. Another video, posted soon after, showed the aftermath, with people motionless on the floor. By identifying some key features - such as the water dispenser and a shoe repair shop - we can confirm the incident took place in a northern area of Kharkiv. There were multiple reports of Russian shelling on that day. We've also been sent further footage, shot around the same time of day but from further down the street, 23 Serpnya Lane. (The name of the street is a reference to 23 August 1943, when the city was liberated from German Nazi forces.) Timestamped 12:46, the footage is filmed from inside a car driving towards the incident. As it turns into 23 Serpnya Lane, there is a succession of quick explosions, and one person falls to the ground. We showed these clips to four weapons experts, including Sam Cranny-Evans, a research analyst at the Royal United Services Institute, a defence think tank. He says the car footage is consistent with a cluster bomb attack as it shows ""lots of small explosions in a relatively small area"". Cluster munitions are rockets or missiles that deploy a large number of small explosives. Usually they are fired from the ground, and as the projectile reaches its target, it opens up and disperses all its bomblets. Weapons intelligence specialist Pete Norton agrees that the evidence ""correlates with the use of sub-munitions"" - the individual bomblets in a cluster weapon. Norton notes that the explosions in the video are ""relatively small charges"". We also showed experts footage of the same attack from a different angle. They suggested a combination of rockets and cluster munitions appeared to have been used. A still from camera footage obtained by the BBC, which shows several explosions along 23 Serpnya Lane The use of cluster munitions has been criticised by human rights groups and some governments. When bomblets are released they scatter over wide areas, potentially harming people nearby. There's also danger in the aftermath. According to Mr Cranny-Evans, a rocket launcher can deploy up to 7,000 cluster bombs and usually about 2% of them don't detonate. These unexploded bomblets can kill or maim civilians long after a conflict has ended, and are costly to locate and remove. Over 100 countries are part of an international treaty which bans the making or use of these weapons, but Russia and Ukraine are not signed up and both have cluster munitions. The Kremlin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov denied the use of these weapons on Tuesday. Russia has been widely accused of hitting civilian targets deliberately, but in the case of the water dispenser attack, investigators from Amnesty International believe it's theoretically possible that there was an intention to strike the nearby headquarters of a company called XADO. The building is on the same street from which Andriy witnessed the attack. XADO is a chemical company that is also understood to have made rifles. But there's no suggestion there was any manufacturing going on in the headquarters building, which is in a residential area. Even if XADO was the target, experts think cluster bombs should not have been used. ""If it was a target that was considered so important that it needed a missile strike to be launched against it, you would use a missile with a unitary high explosive warhead,"" says Mr Cranny-Evans. ""A cluster munition is devastating and psychologically traumatic, but is ultimately ineffective if the people are inside a building. If you want to destroy a building you need a lot of high explosives, not lots of little explosions."" The BBC has contacted the Russian embassy in London for comment.

Amnesty International investigators contacted the individual who took the images, and said they were sent more images from the scene of the attack. We've reviewed the images and have also seen damaged vehicles and shots of the wider area in which the cluster sub-munition was found. Metadata contained in the images confirms a creation date of 28 February. The writing on the image of the cluster sub-munition above shows that it was made in Russia in 2019, according to Amnesty. The investigators say Russia stopped selling such weapons to Ukraine in 2012. We also looked at evidence of other alleged cluster bomb attacks. For instance, video footage geolocated by the BBC shows a series of explosions in a north-eastern neighbourhood of Kharkiv, close to a shopping centre. Weapons experts have suggested these explosions are also consistent with cluster attacks. Plumes of smoke can be seem rising after several explosions in a Kharkiv neighbourhood Images have also emerged of an attack on a kindergarten in the town of Okhtyrka. The incident killed six people, including a child, according to the city's mayor. Before and after the attack, there were several reports on social media that Russian troops were in the area. Pictures of the aftermath show bloodied bodies laying out the ground nearby, and holes in the roof of the building that are consistent with cluster bomblets, many experts say. Reporters at open-source intelligence group Bellingcat geolocated a cluster munitions warhead which they believe was fired by a BM-27 rocket launcher based approximately 200m east of the kindergarten. That attack led the foreign minister of Ukraine, Dmytro Kuleba, to accuse Russia of committing war crimes. A number of Western leaders have made similar allegations, and the International Criminal Court has opened an investigation into the claims. Russia faces war crimes investigation over Ukraine Under international law, only military targets can be attacked. The BBC spoke to Noam Lubell, a professor of international law at Essex University and showed him footage of the attacks. He said it raises serious concerns. The first thing to consider is the intended target and the precautions taken to avoid civilian harm. Even if the intended target had been military in the Kharkiv water dispenser attack, Prof Lubell says, the attack could still be unlawful when it is in a civilian area. The means and methods of attack must be considered, as well as whether the expected harm to civilians outweighs the military advantage. Prof Lubell added that ""using explosive munitions that cause damage across a wide area in an urban environment is highly likely to fall foul of the prohibition on indiscriminate attacks, and at the very least warrants an investigation into possible violations of international humanitarian law"". Philippe Sands, professor of law at University College London, said that the scale of civilian casualties witnessed during the latest conflict in Ukraine suggests some intentionality. ""Just as I've been watching it from day one, there have been consistent and regular reports of civilian objectives being targeted, either intentionally or otherwise, on a scale that suggests that this is maybe intentional."" He added: ""The impression that's been given us is that there is an effort to terrify the population."" As for Andriy, he and his family are now hiding in the basement of a private nursery. But even below ground, they cannot escape the constant sound of shelling.

"Rosneft boss Igor Sechin's yacht Amore Vero - meaning ""true love"" - has been seized French authorities have seized a super yacht owned by an oligarch as part of the sanctions against Russia. A yacht owned by Igor Sechin, boss of Russian state energy company Rosneft, was grabbed by French customs officers near Marseille. However, German authorities denieda report,externalthat they had seized a $600m vessel owned by Russian metal tycoon Alisher Usmanov in Hamburg. On Thursday, Mr Usmanov was one oftwo more Russians sanctioned by the UK. The BBC understands that some oligarchs sanctioned by the European Union are ""shocked"" to find their debit cards no longer function, and they are now relying on using cash from safes. The French acted quickly on Wednesday when customs officers noticed that Mr Sechin's 88-metre ""Amore Vero"" - which translates as ""true love"" - was ""taking steps to sail off urgently"". UK must target Putin's Mayfair lifestyle, says Labour It arrived in in the Mediterranean port of La Ciotat in January and had been due to stay there while being repaired until 1 April. It has also been reported that yachts belonging to five other Russian billionaires were heading to the Maldives, regarded as a safe home because it does not have an extradition treaty with the US. The move by France came as the Prime Minister's official spokesman rejected claims that the UK has been slower at introducing sanctions than the EU or that legal hold-ups are preventing sanctions on Russian oligarchs. He reiterated the UK's position that it was better to prioritise the measures that had the biggest economic impact, rather than targeting individuals just because they were well known. Some oligarchs have been sanctioned by the government, which means their UK bank accounts are frozen and access to funds denied. But others are taking advantage of any delay in adding them to its list. A lawyer told the BBC that wealthy Russians were looking to move their money out of the UK before being hit by sanctions. ""The government has softened the blow by giving [wealthy Russians] time to move their money out,"" lawyer Nigel Kushner of W Legal told the BBC. Speaking to the Today programme, he said: ""Clients have been asking: 'Can I move my money out before I'm on the list?' I will say yes, that's perfectly legitimate."" The government's list of Russians sanctioned includes 195 individuals, but most predate the invasion of Ukraine. Since the start of the war just 15 Russians have been added to the sanctions list, including President Vladimir Putin. Security Minister Damian Hinds told the BBC that the wealth of Russian oligarchs with British investments would not prevent the UK Government from ""going after"" them. ""There will be more individuals (who) can be sanctioned,"" he told BBC Breakfast. ""We will be going after people as needed."" Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said legal threats would not prevent the UK government sanctioning Russian oligarchs. In an interview in Lithuania, she said: ""We have to make sure we have the right evidence to put in place those sanctions. ""We will continue to work through our list, we will continue to sanction oligarchs and there is nowhere for any of Putin's cronies to hide."" Energy bills could reach Â£3,000 as oil price soars Growing numbers of firms pull back from Russia What sanctions could West still impose on Russia? Meanwhile, the London Stock Exchange (LSE) has suspended the shares of 28 Russian-linked companies because of sanctions introduced following the invasion of Ukraine. They include green energy and metals company En+ Group run by US-sanctioned oligarch Oleg Deripaska, which is chaired by Conservative peer and former energy minister Greg Barker. The decision to suspend the listings ""has been based on sanctions and the ability to run an orderly market,"" said LSE chief executive David Schwimmer. ""If we see any other securities affected by sanctions then similar actions will take place."" Last week, a subsidiary of Russia's second largest bank, VTB, was suspended on the LSE as a result of sanctions. However, a number of Russian companies, including Roman Abramovich-backed Evraz, continue to trade on the stock market despite criticism from politicians. New economic sanctions have also been announced to stop Russian aviation and space companies getting access to the UK insurance market. The move will limit the benefits Russian businesses can receive from their access to the global insurance and reinsurance market through Lloyd's, the world's biggest insurance market.

"Residents of Mariupol say they are under continuous bombardment. ""We are terrified,"" said Maxim Residents of the Ukrainian port city of Mariupol have told the BBC they are trying to survive a relentless barrage of Russian shelling that has smashed residential districts and cut off power and water supplies. ""There has been no light, no heat, and no water now for two full days and we have hardly any food left,"" said Maxim, 27, an IT developer who was hiding in his grandparents' apartment on Thursday morning. ""Food and medicine is not moving in Mariupol now. The local government tried to give out bread and water but it is gone,"" he said. ""I filled the bath with water before the water stopped. We have about five litres left."" Maxim left his apartment after the Russian invasion began last week to be with his grandparents, who are in their eighties and cannot leave their sixth-floor, city-centre apartment. The three of them are sheltering with their pets in the hallway of the apartment, with no heating in the depth of winter, hiding from a barrage of shelling. ""The shelling started again at six this morning,"" Maxim said. ""The city was completely black overnight, there was no source of light apart from the explosions. It was quiet for a few hours but then at dawn it started again. We can hear it now from every direction. We are terrified."" A detonation on the horizon, photographed by Maxim Mariupol, a city of 400,000, is a key strategic target for Russia, because seizing it would allow Russian-backed rebels in eastern Ukraine to join forces with troops in Crimea, the southern peninsula annexed by Russia in 2014. Russia's defence ministry urged civilians on Thursday to evacuate the city by a humanitarian corridor, but residents said there had been no break in the shelling to allow people to move. Communications have been virtually down for two days, residents said, preventing people in the city from reaching one another. Multiple calls to residents either disconnected repeatedly or failed to connect in the first place. Speaking to the BBC on Thursday morning, the city's deputy mayor Serhiy Orlov said the whole city was now without power, water, or its sanitation system. ""We had 15 main power lines and all of them are now down. We are getting completely cut off - destroyed by artillery. Only the natural gas supply is left,"" he said. ""Mariupol is still Ukrainian right now, we still control inside the perimeter, but there is fighting on the streets on the outskirts and we are on the line of a humanitarian crisis."" A damaged residential building in the Ukrainian port city of Mariupol Mr Orlov still hasn't been able to reach his father, mother and brother, who live together in a residential district that has been heavily bombarded since Monday night, he said. ""I can't reach them by any means, the shelling is continuous."" Dmytro, an activist in the city, told the BBC he could hear constant gunfire and explosions from where he was sheltering. After less than a minute the phone connection cut off and he couldn't be reached again. Alexander, a 44-year-old engineer in the city, said he was sheltering with his wife, two sons and mother in a five-storey building. ""We have been bombed and shelled for five days and right now I can hear shots and bombs non-stop,"" he said. ""There is still some bread at the shop near us, but we don't know when the food supply will end. What will happen when we run out of our water? What will happen when my phone battery dies? We will have no connection to the outside at all."" LIVE:Latest updates from on the ground THE BASICS:Why is Putin invading Ukraine? RUSSIA:Watching the war on TV UKRAINE:'I have never felt so much love for my homeland' IN DEPTH:Full coverage of the conflict For the family members of Mariupol residents in other parts of Ukraine, there is only the agonising wait for a phone call. Alina Hrydina, a 31-year-old marketer in Kyiv, last spoke to her parents on Wednesday morning when they called to wish her brother a happy birthday. Since then she can't reach them, or her aunt or grandmother. ""I saw some pictures online that suggested the central area where they live was still OK, not on fire,"" she said. ""This is the only thought I have right now. I am only holding on to this hope."" If Mariupol is seized by the invading Russian forces, Ukrainian troops between the city and the Donbas region seized by Russian-backed separatist forces in 2014 could be surrounded and a large new part of Ukraine's east occupied. Among the residents, there are fears Russian forces are willing to level large parts of the city in order to take it. Maxim said he was praying that the Ukrainian army would be able to hold off the invasion and restore the water supply. ""We cannot leave this apartment to get food, water, anything,"" he said. ""We are cold and at night it is completely black."" He said he would try to talk again later on Thursday but his single battery pack was less than half charged.

"Nearly all services have been affected due to a second 24-hour strike this week No Tube service is expected before 08:00 GMT on Friday, TfL says The first strike on Tuesday resulted in all London Underground lines being hit About 10,000 London Underground workers from the RMT union have walked out in a dispute is over pensions, jobs and working conditions Anna Lindsay and Sarah Lee Londoners look for other means of transport as the second Tube strike this week causes travel misery. Sarah LeeBBC London And with that, that's all from us here at BBC London this evening. We're off to try and find a bus. Over and out! Helen HoddinottJournalist I've just spoken to a commuter at King's Cross, Annette, who told me she is carrying on with her evening plans in central London, despite the strike. ""I'm meeting some friends for dinner tonight in Soho,"" she tells me. ""I would normally get there from on the Northern Line to Leicester Square and then walk. ""But today I got the overground and I'm just trying work out how to get there from Kings Cross. ""It's a bit bleak at the moment but I'm sure I'll get there at some point."" The picture is worsening this evening. All Tubes lines are now completely suspended except the Central Line, according to Transport for London (TfL). The Central Line has a limited service between Loughton and Liverpool Street, between Newbury Park and Liverpool Street via Hainault, and between White City and Ealing Broadway/West Ruislip. DLR and London Overground have reduced services. Tom EdwardsTransport Correspondent, BBC London So where have two days of strikes and what will be, by tomorrow, four days of disruption got us? What has changed? Not much. Undoubtedly the RMT union has made its point, by closing the Tube, that it takes the threat to pensions very seriously. But has that led to a rethink by Transport for London (TfL) chiefs? No. TfL has to carry out the pension review as part of the emergency funding it received from central government. It is going to happen and is set to report back on 31 March. The worry for commuters is the dispute could actually escalate. The other Tube drivers' union Aslef might not like the pension proposals, so it, too, could strike. Both sides in this are bound to their positions - the unions by their members and TfL by the funding settlement. Could the government change the funding? Very unlikely. So I think this could just be the beginning. Helen HoddinottJournalist All the entrances to the underground at King's Cross have been gated off ahead of the evening rush hour. Outside of the station, people are waiting for the buses, but one bus did not stop and would not let anyone else on - it was that crammed. I saw a bus on the other side of the road heading towards central London, which is also looking very packed - there is a bit of a crowd waiting there. People I've spoken to say they are determined to head into central London for their Thursday evening plans. The taxi rank has about 40 people waiting in front of it at the moment. Night is finally falling on the second 24-hour Tube strike. Today has felt less chaotic than Tuesday as people have seemed to have planned accordingly. BBC London For a full round-up of today's Tube strike tune into BBC One,or click on iPlayer,from 18:35 GMT to watch BBC London analyse what has been happening today and what is expected for tomorrow. BBC London's Transport Correspondent Tom Edwards will have all the latest. Tom EdwardsTransport Correspondent, BBC London This is a red hot issue for the unions. The other unions - Aslef and the TSSA - also do not want changes to the pension. The government has said the mayor should present a report on how to make the pension scheme ""financially sustainable"" by the end of March. The funding document says: ""As part of the review of TfL's pension scheme, TfL will deliver a final report, including a recommended approach and implementation plan by no later than 31 March 2022."" It feels more like the beginning than the end of this dispute and that means more strikes are likely. Not much has changed in the past hour - the strike by 10,000 Tube workers is continuing to cause chaos for travellers in the capital this rush hour: The RMT union representing the 10,000 Tube workers on strike fears spending cuts linked to a funding deal by the government will lead to hundreds of job losses, reduced pensions and worse working conditions. RMT general secretary Mick Lynchsaid: ""The fight goes on and our executive will consider the next steps in the campaign. ""We remain available for talks with those in a position to offer a concrete solution rather than the hollow words we have been hearing from the mayor and his senior officials."" Andy Lord, TfL's chief operating officer,said: ""We haven't proposed any changes to pensions or terms and conditions, and nobody has lost or will lose their jobs because of the proposals we have set out, so this action is completely unnecessary. ""We know our customers deserve better than this continued disruption and that is why we're urging the RMT to talk to us so we can find a resolution to this dispute which has already damaged London's recovery from the pandemic."" It doesn't seem there will be a resolution any time soon.  Sarah LeeBBC London Commuters face a fourth day of travel misery on Friday due to the knock-on impact of today's strike by 10,000 Tube workers. Transport for London (TfL) is warning that no Tube is expected to run until 08:00 GMT on Friday, similar to Wednesday morning after Tuesday's strike, with further disruption likely through the day. The RMT union's executive will meet to decide its next move in the bitter row, with further stoppages not being ruled out. Picket lines have been mounted outside Tube stations today and the union said its members were showing ""magnificent"" support for the industrial action. There were long queues again for buses and taxis, although not as bad as on Tuesday, as many people decided to work from home rather than spend hours trying to get to and from offices. Olivia DemetriadesBBC London Here are some of the travellers we've spoken to today... Here's the latest at the top of the hour, as 10,000 Tube workers strike and bring most London Underground lines to a standstill: No 10 has urged both sides in the Tube strikes to ""get around the table"" to resolve the issues at hand. Prime Minister Boris Johnson's official spokesman said: ""I think these ongoing strikes clearly are bringing misery to many Londoners, and we want both sides to get around the table and put an end to this disruptive action. ""It's a blow to businesses as they recover from Covid restrictions and it's stopping people from getting to work."" Transport for London (TfL) is already warning Londoners to prepare for more disruption to journeys tomorrow morning following todayâs Tube strike. Allow Twitter content?

Chi Chioma says: ""The woman at the station said [the strikes] are because of poor working conditions and pay and stuff so I guess itâs fair enough but itâs a bit inconvenient as well."" Chi Chi says: ""We had to walk from the station, we were waiting for the bus, but it was so full, off the get go, loads of people just flocking to buses and I didnât really think it was Covid safe, so we just booked an Uber instead. But the traffic is quite bad so itâs been stuck on the same time for the last 10 or 15 minutes maybe. It was pricey, about Â£20."" Do the sisters have any sympathy for those on the picket line? ""I kind of get it, like itâs inconvenient for us,"" Chi Chi adds ""but itâs inconvenience for them as well because theyâre trying to work a job to get paid but theyâre still not being met with fair treatment so itâs understandable to be honest.""

"Nearly all services have been affected due to a second 24-hour strike this week No Tube service is expected before 08:00 GMT on Friday, TfL says The first strike on Tuesday resulted in all London Underground lines being hit About 10,000 London Underground workers from the RMT union have walked out in a dispute is over pensions, jobs and working conditions Anna Lindsay and Sarah Lee Londoners look for other means of transport as the second Tube strike this week causes travel misery. Sarah LeeBBC London And with that, that's all from us here at BBC London this evening. We're off to try and find a bus. Over and out! Helen HoddinottJournalist I've just spoken to a commuter at King's Cross, Annette, who told me she is carrying on with her evening plans in central London, despite the strike. ""I'm meeting some friends for dinner tonight in Soho,"" she tells me. ""I would normally get there from on the Northern Line to Leicester Square and then walk. ""But today I got the overground and I'm just trying work out how to get there from Kings Cross. ""It's a bit bleak at the moment but I'm sure I'll get there at some point."" The picture is worsening this evening. All Tubes lines are now completely suspended except the Central Line, according to Transport for London (TfL). The Central Line has a limited service between Loughton and Liverpool Street, between Newbury Park and Liverpool Street via Hainault, and between White City and Ealing Broadway/West Ruislip. DLR and London Overground have reduced services. Tom EdwardsTransport Correspondent, BBC London So where have two days of strikes and what will be, by tomorrow, four days of disruption got us? What has changed? Not much. Undoubtedly the RMT union has made its point, by closing the Tube, that it takes the threat to pensions very seriously. But has that led to a rethink by Transport for London (TfL) chiefs? No. TfL has to carry out the pension review as part of the emergency funding it received from central government. It is going to happen and is set to report back on 31 March. The worry for commuters is the dispute could actually escalate. The other Tube drivers' union Aslef might not like the pension proposals, so it, too, could strike. Both sides in this are bound to their positions - the unions by their members and TfL by the funding settlement. Could the government change the funding? Very unlikely. So I think this could just be the beginning. Helen HoddinottJournalist All the entrances to the underground at King's Cross have been gated off ahead of the evening rush hour. Outside of the station, people are waiting for the buses, but one bus did not stop and would not let anyone else on - it was that crammed. I saw a bus on the other side of the road heading towards central London, which is also looking very packed - there is a bit of a crowd waiting there. People I've spoken to say they are determined to head into central London for their Thursday evening plans. The taxi rank has about 40 people waiting in front of it at the moment. Night is finally falling on the second 24-hour Tube strike. Today has felt less chaotic than Tuesday as people have seemed to have planned accordingly. BBC London For a full round-up of today's Tube strike tune into BBC One,or click on iPlayer,from 18:35 GMT to watch BBC London analyse what has been happening today and what is expected for tomorrow. BBC London's Transport Correspondent Tom Edwards will have all the latest. Tom EdwardsTransport Correspondent, BBC London This is a red hot issue for the unions. The other unions - Aslef and the TSSA - also do not want changes to the pension. The government has said the mayor should present a report on how to make the pension scheme ""financially sustainable"" by the end of March. The funding document says: ""As part of the review of TfL's pension scheme, TfL will deliver a final report, including a recommended approach and implementation plan by no later than 31 March 2022."" It feels more like the beginning than the end of this dispute and that means more strikes are likely.

"The OneWeb satellites were due to be launched from the Baikonur spaceport OneWeb, the satellite company part-owned by the UK government, says it is suspending all launches from the Russian-operated Baikonur spaceport. The firm had hoped to send up 36 spacecraft on a Soyuz rocket from the Kazakhstan cosmodrome, but the mission has become embroiled in the fall-out over the invasion of Ukraine. Russia put down demands ahead of the flight that OneWeb could not meet. These included a guarantee that armed forces wouldn't use the satellites. Russia also wanted the UK government to divest itself of OneWeb shares, an ultimatum that was firmly rejected by Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng. UK rejects Russian demand to sell satellite share Stop rocket launch from Russian site, UK urged What sanctions are being imposed on Russia? UK space start-up gets $500m cash injection Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The board of OneWeb, which is headquartered in west London, voted on Thursday morning to suspend all future launches from Baikonur. It had been planning a series of flights from the cosmodrome this year to complete its broadband internet constellation in the sky. The firm will now be working with its French partner Arianespace, which organises Soyuz launches around the world, to find alternative rocket rides. This will be difficult, however. There is a dearth of available vehicles in the class needed by OneWeb. The company currently has 428 spacecraft in orbit. This is sufficient to provide space-borne internet connections above 50 degrees North (which includes the UK), but close to 650 satellites are required to run a truly global service. After OneWeb's announcement, Mr Kwarteng, whose department has a seat on the board, followed up with his own comments, tweeting: ""In light of Russia's illegal and unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, we are reviewing our participation in all further projects involving Russian collaboration."" This would appear to bring an end to the ""will it, won't"" confusion over whether the Soyuz rocket standing on the pad at Baikonur would actually launch on Friday. Allow Twitter content?

Mr Rogozin posted a video of pad workers on Wednesday covering up UK, US and Japanese flags When the vehicle, with 36 OneWeb satellites nestled under its nosecone, was rolled out by cosmodrome workers on Wednesday, it seemed that the flight was ""go!"". But then the head of the Russian space agency Roscosmos, Dimitry Rogozin, started to make demands before he would give the flight approval. These demands, he said, were a response to western sanctions imposed on Russia because of the war in Ukraine. First, he wanted assurances that OneWeb's system wouldn't be used for military purposes - an impossible ask given that UK and US forces are very keen to use the internet system. Then he wanted the ""hostile"" UK government to sell its shares in the company - instantly rebuffed by the business secretary. Mr Rogozin ended by posting a video of pad workers covering up UK, US and Japanese flags on the rocket's nosecone. Assuming Friday's planned launch is indeed cancelled, there arises the question of what happens to the 36 satellites. These remain the property of OneWeb, but it's unclear how they could be returned. There are currently no OneWeb staff in Baikonur to organise a shipment, even if Russia agreed to release the spacecraft. The company's manufacturing facility is in Florida where the production line can turn out two satellites a day, so they could quickly be replaced if alternative rockets are sourced. Mr Rogozin has already stated that money received in exchange for Soyuz rockets will not be given back. ""Due to force majeure circumstances that have arisen as a result of the aggressive policy of the West and the sanctions that are applied against Russia, this money will remain in Russia,"" he said.

"UK energy bills could reach as high as Â£3,000 a year as oil and gas prices surge amid the Ukraine conflict, the energy industry has said. Russia's invasion of Ukraine has made the trading, banking and shipping sectors reluctant to buy Russian commodities, pushing up prices. The price of Brent crude oil rose above $119 a barrel to the highest since May 2012, while gas prices rose as well. Average UK petrol prices have also hit a new record. The RAC said petrol reached Â£1.52 a litre for the first time, while diesel rose to a high of 155.79p. Russian oil and gas exports are exempted from Western sanctions for now, but the prospect of further action by the US and the EU is stifling Russian trade. Emma Pinchbeck, the chief executive of the energy industry body Energy UK, said: ""It's a really worrying time for both customers and industry. ""We've been saying since the autumn that we'd expect bills to go up again in October. With what we're seeing in Ukraine and in the oil and gas markets, we're now expecting those to go up further."" She said that if oil prices remain at elevated levels ""you can expect bills to be anywhere between Â£2,500 and Â£3,000 in October depending on the tariffs people have and what happens in the market"". The prices that people pay for energy and fuel depend on wholesale markets, which can go down as well as up. But average UK household energy bills are already set to rise to around Â£2,000 in Aprilwhen the price cap is increased. Will Russia's invasion push up gas bills? Energy bills set to soar but millions may get Â£200 help Gas prices had hit record highs last year due to colder winters which put pressure on supplies and reduced the amount of reserves countries had stored up. Ms Pinchbeck said: ""We have been saying for a long time this is an enduring crisis on the gas price and now that's being exacerbated by what's happening in Ukraine."" The RAC also warned that high fuel prices could be here to stay. RAC spokesman Simon Williams, said: ""What drivers pay at the pumps in the UK is determined by the cost of oil and the exchange rate as fuel, like oil, is traded in dollars."" He said with oil prices rising and the value of the pound at $1.33 ""further price rises are inevitable in the coming days and weeks"". Brent crude rose as a high as $119.84 a barrel at one point on Thursday, before sliding back to about $112. Meanwhile, European stock markets slipped as the Russian invasion continued. The UK's FTSE 100 share index closed down 2.5%, while the main markets in France and Germany ended down 1.8% and 2.1% respectively. Energy companies are sending emails to customers right now warning of price rises to hit in April - but these are a frozen picture. Bills are massively increasing as the price cap is going up by more than 50% and it is starting to feel real now, as people are now being told how much their individual direct debits will increase by. But those increases don't take account of what is currently taking place in Ukraine. The price cap is been raised every six month which means there is a half-year lag in protecting customers from immediate fluctuations on the global gas and oil markets. There was such huge pressure on the government to step in and act ahead of April's increase that they announced a package of extra help for households this time. It's not until the next price cap rise in October that we will feel the impact of the gas and oil spikes going on right now. The government will be under more pressure to help customers, and while for many households another energy price rise is unthinkable, there also seems to be a growing acceptance among consumers that the 'Putin Penalty' is one we will all have to shoulder to some extent. A government spokesperson said: ""It is hard to predict what longer term impacts the current situation in Ukraine will have on energy costs. ""However, the energy price cap will continue to insulate millions of customers from volatile global gas prices."" Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets.com, said oil traders were acting as though Russian energy exports had already been sanctioned, and were looking for other sources of oil. ""Self-sanctions are already playing a big role,"" he said. ""Shell, BP, Chevron are all exiting but traders and customers are swerving Russian oil without any sanctions needed."" ""European gas prices hit a record this morning. Coal prices are through the roof too,"" he said, adding there was ""nowhere to hide for European consumers about to get hit by a mega electricity bill and soaring inflation."" Average UK petrol prices have hit a fresh high Energy prices are pushing up the cost of living in the UK. The UK rate of inflation - which shows the cost of living - rose at a 30-year high of 5.5% in January and is expected to rise above 7% once the new energy price cap is introduced in the spring. Russia is the second biggest exporter of crude oil, and is also the world's largest natural gas exporter. Oil cartel Opec decided not to increase production further than already planned at a meeting on Wednesday, despite US calls to pump more oil. Ukraine and Russia are also two of the world's largest wheat producers, and account for nearly a third of global exports. Exports from the Black Sea have nearly halted amid the invasion of Ukraine and sanctions. Wheat prices jumped earlier in the week, but fell back on Thursday.

"The Russian rouble dropped precipitously last week A raft of actions by the West is aimed at choking Russia's economy and banking system, and punishing Vladimir Putin's inner circle. What more sanctions could they impose? In response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the US, UK, EU and more than two dozen other nations retaliated with economic measures that have sent the Russian rouble tumbling, cut major Russian banks from the global financial system and hurt state-owned firms and oligarchs, including Mr Putin himself. The US says its actions hit 80% of banking assets in Russia; and the EU 70%. The allies have also taken steps to limit Russia's access to key technology, such as microchips and lasers; and moved against cryptocurrencies. Together, they represent the toughest sanctions Mr Putin's Russia has ever faced. And analysts expect policymakers to continue tightening - for example, by adding more kinds of technology and new companies to blacklists. The most recent action by the US, on Wednesday, targeted oil refining equipment, among other steps. ""We are at a seven or eight out of 10 on the escalation ladder right now,"" said Emily Kilcrease, senior fellow and director of the Energy, Economics and Security Program at the Washington think tank, the Center for New American Security. ""There is definitely still room to go with tightening."" Many Western companies, including BP, Apple and others have responded to the situation by taking steps to halt services or exit the country. What sanctions are being imposed on Russia? 'I can't pay' - Russians feel the pain of sanctions Russian oligarch warns sanctions will not stop war But for now, trade can still flow - not least key exports like oil and gas, for which Russia is a major global supplier. Western policymakers have been reluctant to hit energy, in part for fear of causing a spike in energy prices that would cause economic damage at home as well - especially in Europe, which relies on Russia for roughly 40% of its gas imports and roughly 30% of its oil imports. But as the violence in Ukraine has escalated, there is growing pressure on the US and Europe to act. Will the West target Russian oil and gas exports for sanctions? ""My sense is that it's going to become politically untenable to say we'll keep paying Russia for oil, gas and coal,"" says Christopher Miller, professor at Tufts University's Fletcher School and an expert on the Russian economy. ""That's already been politically tough for Western leaders to stand by and I think it's going to become even tougher as the Russian military escalates its use of force."" It's a tricky calculus. While oil and gas transactions are key to preventing the Russian economy from going ""off a cliff"", cutting off that lifeline risks provoking more extreme reaction by Russia, says Jeffrey Schott, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a Washington think tank. ""The level of economic pressure now is severe. If you go for the economic jugular, Putin may respond with cyber and military action that will only make the suffering worse,"" he says. What's more the commitment, announced by Western allies this week, to release a 60m barrels of oil from strategic national reserves - half of which will come from the US - will only act to soften a temporary spike in prices. Russia may be able to withstand the loss of Western buyers, if it can sell less on the global markets at a higher price, says Ms Kilcrease. ""People I think want to see something there... but you have to think about the effect of what cutting off those sales would actually be. Will it hurt Russia? It's not actually clear,"" she says. The sanctions have already caused economic havoc in Russia. Before closing this week, the two major Moscow stock indexes plunged more than 20%. The rouble has dropped to record lows against the dollar, hurting the purchasing power of Russian families at a time when rising prices and deteriorating standard of living were already concerns. The war has sparked protests in Russia, which has also seen the standard of living slide in recent years The consultancy Capital Economics recently estimated that the sanctions could shrink Russia's economy by 15% this year. Nor has the pain been limited to Russia. Global oil prices have already risen more than 10% since the start of February amid the tensions - and analysts expect they will remain elevated due to uncertainty from the conflict. Ukraine and Russia also supply nearly 30% of the world's wheat, 19% of its corn and 80% of its sunflower oil. Currencies in countries with close ties to Russia, like Kazakhstan, have also been hit. ""That's the problem with sanctions - they never just end up targeting only one place,"" says Kristy Ironside, professor of Russian and Soviet history at McGill University. ""They tend to have other knock-on effects so anything [policymakers] do next, they have to consider very carefully in light of that."" LIVE:Latest updates from on the ground THE BASICS:Why is Putin invading Ukraine? RUSSIA:Watching the war on TV UKRAINE:'I have never felt so much love for my homeland' IN DEPTH:Full coverage of the conflict Nor is it clear how economic destabilisation will affect Mr Putin's standing at home - or if they will make him willing to negotiate a political end to the violence in Ukraine. After all, Russians have endured economic isolation before and the ability to afford international travel and imported cheese may not matter much to his base. ""As long as pensions keep getting paid and people can enjoy a relatively reasonable standard of living... I think there's some leeway,"" Prof Ironside says. ""If this is sustained... I don't know."" Prof Miller says he is not optimistic that the sanctions will force Mr Putin to negotiate over Ukraine. But if sustained, he says, they may curb his power. ""Anything that touches the financial system is going to get more complicated and expensive as a result of this,"" Prof Miller says. ""That will have a ripple effect throughout the Russian economy."" ""It will make Russia's economic outlook over the next couple of years substantially dimmer and therefore make it harder for the Russian government to keep its domestic political situation under control while simultaneously waging a set of wars abroad."" ""This is the goal,"" he adds. ""To create this medium to longer term degradation of Russia's abilities."" What are the sanctions on Russia and are they working?

"Brent crude has soared to multi-year highs after Russia invaded Ukraine Even though oil prices have surged to ten-year highs, a powerful cartel of oil-producing countries say they will only increase their output by a modest amount. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, led by Russia, known as Opec+, will not be turning on the taps. The 23-country-strong cartel will add 400,000 barrels of oil per-day to the market from April. The group is sticking firmly to an agreement signed by its members in 2021 - to continue gradual restoration of output that was halted during the pandemic. Many countries produced fewer barrels of oil during the pandemic as demand dropped sharply during lockdowns. However, following Russia's invasion of Ukraine the global benchmark contract for oil,Brent crude, has surged to $119 a barrel, driven by anxiety over tighter supply. Opec+ released a statement attributing the recent rise in prices to market volatility caused by ""current geopolitical tensions"" and stated that there was no shortage of supplies in the market.

RUSSIA:Watching the war on TV UKRAINE:'I have never felt so much love for my homeland' IN DEPTH:Full coverage of the conflict Separately, members of the International Energy Agency (IEA) have also agreed to release more oil on to the market - 60 million barrels - from their strategic petroleum reserves. Half of that volume is expected to come from the United States. But the emergency move did little to reassure stock and commodity markets with oil prices rising immediately after the decision was announced. Oil producing nations have rubber-stamped increasing output by 400,000 barrels of crude a month Energy market experts believe oil prices will remain high in the near-term. Markets are likely to remain volatile because major oil and gas companies, including BP and Shell, have announced plans to exit Russian operations and joint ventures. According to reports, customers of Russian oil are already facing difficulty over payments and shipping after the West's sanctions were imposed,blocking some Russian banks from global payment systems,external. ""In the short run, we are looking at a pretty serious run-up in prices. All this uncertainty about Russia, the potential threat of physical disruptions is making the markets nervous"" says Ben Cahill, a senior fellow at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. Traders suggest oil exporters have been offering Russia's highest-quality oil at a discount over the last few days but found few buyers. Russia is the world's third largest producer of oil, behind the United States and Saudi Arabia. It accounts for 8-10% of global oil supply. Europe relies on Russia for nearly 40% of its natural gas. So, given Russia's crucial position in the global energy market, the US and European Union have, so far, stopped short of imposing sanctions on Russia's oil and gas industries. The IEA will release 60 million barrels of oil from strategic petroleum reserves. Analysts say the group's decision to stick to its timetable - a gradual increase in production - has not come as a surprise, given its previous reluctance to deviate from steadily ramping-up output. Key members of Opec+ may fear that adding more supplies to the market at this stage could lead to an oversupply later in the year. A glut would bring down prices sharply. Energy experts believe that from the cartel's point of view little has changed yet in terms of physical supply on the market. And that prices have risen in direct response to uncertainty over the invasion. However, there have been some noticeable changes, buyers reluctant to purchase from Russia, for instance, are now switching to similar grades of Middle Eastern oil. ""Opec+ has always based its decisions on what the current data is showing them, rather than what the data will look like in the future due to geopolitical factors"" says Ahmed Mehdi, Analyst, Renaissance Energy Advisors, an energy research house. There may also be another reason Opec+ members are holding back. Negotiations to revive the 2015 Iran nuclear deal are widely expected to come to a head in March. If sanctions on oil-producer, Iran, are eased, then it could unlock Iranian oil exports. Mr Cahill believes that the deal could put the brakes on the oil rally, and bring down prices. ""The Iran deal is the wildcard: it could break the price momentum"" he says. If the oil price remains high then the cost of filling up a car will increase with it US president Joe Biden's administration, alarmed by rising fuel prices, has been putting pressure on key Opec member states, such as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), to turn on the taps, with little success. Russian President Vladimir Putin has also been in touch. During a call with Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan it is thought the two leaders discussed the Opec+ deal and pledged to continue coordination on global energy markets.

"UK energy bills could reach as high as Â£3,000 a year as oil and gas prices surge amid the Ukraine conflict, the energy industry has said. Russia's invasion of Ukraine has made the trading, banking and shipping sectors reluctant to buy Russian commodities, pushing up prices. The price of Brent crude oil rose above $119 a barrel to the highest since May 2012, while gas prices rose as well. Average UK petrol prices have also hit a new record. The RAC said petrol reached Â£1.52 a litre for the first time, while diesel rose to a high of 155.79p. Russian oil and gas exports are exempted from Western sanctions for now, but the prospect of further action by the US and the EU is stifling Russian trade. Emma Pinchbeck, the chief executive of the energy industry body Energy UK, said: ""It's a really worrying time for both customers and industry. ""We've been saying since the autumn that we'd expect bills to go up again in October. With what we're seeing in Ukraine and in the oil and gas markets, we're now expecting those to go up further."" She said that if oil prices remain at elevated levels ""you can expect bills to be anywhere between Â£2,500 and Â£3,000 in October depending on the tariffs people have and what happens in the market"". The prices that people pay for energy and fuel depend on wholesale markets, which can go down as well as up. But average UK household energy bills are already set to rise to around Â£2,000 in Aprilwhen the price cap is increased. Will Russia's invasion push up gas bills? Energy bills set to soar but millions may get Â£200 help Gas prices had hit record highs last year due to colder winters which put pressure on supplies and reduced the amount of reserves countries had stored up. Ms Pinchbeck said: ""We have been saying for a long time this is an enduring crisis on the gas price and now that's being exacerbated by what's happening in Ukraine."" The RAC also warned that high fuel prices could be here to stay. RAC spokesman Simon Williams, said: ""What drivers pay at the pumps in the UK is determined by the cost of oil and the exchange rate as fuel, like oil, is traded in dollars."" He said with oil prices rising and the value of the pound at $1.33 ""further price rises are inevitable in the coming days and weeks"". Brent crude rose as a high as $119.84 a barrel at one point on Thursday, before sliding back to about $112. Meanwhile, European stock markets slipped as the Russian invasion continued. The UK's FTSE 100 share index closed down 2.5%, while the main markets in France and Germany ended down 1.8% and 2.1% respectively. Energy companies are sending emails to customers right now warning of price rises to hit in April - but these are a frozen picture. Bills are massively increasing as the price cap is going up by more than 50% and it is starting to feel real now, as people are now being told how much their individual direct debits will increase by. But those increases don't take account of what is currently taking place in Ukraine. The price cap is been raised every six month which means there is a half-year lag in protecting customers from immediate fluctuations on the global gas and oil markets. There was such huge pressure on the government to step in and act ahead of April's increase that they announced a package of extra help for households this time. It's not until the next price cap rise in October that we will feel the impact of the gas and oil spikes going on right now. The government will be under more pressure to help customers, and while for many households another energy price rise is unthinkable, there also seems to be a growing acceptance among consumers that the 'Putin Penalty' is one we will all have to shoulder to some extent. A government spokesperson said: ""It is hard to predict what longer term impacts the current situation in Ukraine will have on energy costs. ""However, the energy price cap will continue to insulate millions of customers from volatile global gas prices."" Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets.com, said oil traders were acting as though Russian energy exports had already been sanctioned, and were looking for other sources of oil. ""Self-sanctions are already playing a big role,"" he said. ""Shell, BP, Chevron are all exiting but traders and customers are swerving Russian oil without any sanctions needed."" ""European gas prices hit a record this morning. Coal prices are through the roof too,"" he said, adding there was ""nowhere to hide for European consumers about to get hit by a mega electricity bill and soaring inflation."" Average UK petrol prices have hit a fresh high Energy prices are pushing up the cost of living in the UK. The UK rate of inflation - which shows the cost of living - rose at a 30-year high of 5.5% in January and is expected to rise above 7% once the new energy price cap is introduced in the spring. Russia is the second biggest exporter of crude oil, and is also the world's largest natural gas exporter. Oil cartel Opec decided not to increase production further than already planned at a meeting on Wednesday, despite US calls to pump more oil. Ukraine and Russia are also two of the world's largest wheat producers, and account for nearly a third of global exports. Exports from the Black Sea have nearly halted amid the invasion of Ukraine and sanctions. Wheat prices jumped earlier in the week, but fell back on Thursday.

"Nearly all services have been affected due to a second 24-hour strike this week No Tube service is expected before 08:00 GMT on Friday, TfL says The first strike on Tuesday resulted in all London Underground lines being hit About 10,000 London Underground workers from the RMT union have walked out in a dispute is over pensions, jobs and working conditions Anna Lindsay and Sarah Lee Londoners look for other means of transport as the second Tube strike this week causes travel misery. Sarah LeeBBC London And with that, that's all from us here at BBC London this evening. We're off to try and find a bus. Over and out! Helen HoddinottJournalist I've just spoken to a commuter at King's Cross, Annette, who told me she is carrying on with her evening plans in central London, despite the strike. ""I'm meeting some friends for dinner tonight in Soho,"" she tells me. ""I would normally get there from on the Northern Line to Leicester Square and then walk. ""But today I got the overground and I'm just trying work out how to get there from Kings Cross. ""It's a bit bleak at the moment but I'm sure I'll get there at some point."" The picture is worsening this evening. All Tubes lines are now completely suspended except the Central Line, according to Transport for London (TfL). The Central Line has a limited service between Loughton and Liverpool Street, between Newbury Park and Liverpool Street via Hainault, and between White City and Ealing Broadway/West Ruislip. DLR and London Overground have reduced services. Tom EdwardsTransport Correspondent, BBC London So where have two days of strikes and what will be, by tomorrow, four days of disruption got us? What has changed? Not much. Undoubtedly the RMT union has made its point, by closing the Tube, that it takes the threat to pensions very seriously. But has that led to a rethink by Transport for London (TfL) chiefs? No. TfL has to carry out the pension review as part of the emergency funding it received from central government. It is going to happen and is set to report back on 31 March. The worry for commuters is the dispute could actually escalate. The other Tube drivers' union Aslef might not like the pension proposals, so it, too, could strike. Both sides in this are bound to their positions - the unions by their members and TfL by the funding settlement. Could the government change the funding? Very unlikely. So I think this could just be the beginning. Helen HoddinottJournalist All the entrances to the underground at King's Cross have been gated off ahead of the evening rush hour. Outside of the station, people are waiting for the buses, but one bus did not stop and would not let anyone else on - it was that crammed. I saw a bus on the other side of the road heading towards central London, which is also looking very packed - there is a bit of a crowd waiting there. People I've spoken to say they are determined to head into central London for their Thursday evening plans. The taxi rank has about 40 people waiting in front of it at the moment. Night is finally falling on the second 24-hour Tube strike. Today has felt less chaotic than Tuesday as people have seemed to have planned accordingly. BBC London For a full round-up of today's Tube strike tune into BBC One,or click on iPlayer,from 18:35 GMT to watch BBC London analyse what has been happening today and what is expected for tomorrow. BBC London's Transport Correspondent Tom Edwards will have all the latest. Tom EdwardsTransport Correspondent, BBC London This is a red hot issue for the unions. The other unions - Aslef and the TSSA - also do not want changes to the pension. The government has said the mayor should present a report on how to make the pension scheme ""financially sustainable"" by the end of March. The funding document says: ""As part of the review of TfL's pension scheme, TfL will deliver a final report, including a recommended approach and implementation plan by no later than 31 March 2022."" It feels more like the beginning than the end of this dispute and that means more strikes are likely. Not much has changed in the past hour - the strike by 10,000 Tube workers is continuing to cause chaos for travellers in the capital this rush hour: The RMT union representing the 10,000 Tube workers on strike fears spending cuts linked to a funding deal by the government will lead to hundreds of job losses, reduced pensions and worse working conditions. RMT general secretary Mick Lynchsaid: ""The fight goes on and our executive will consider the next steps in the campaign. ""We remain available for talks with those in a position to offer a concrete solution rather than the hollow words we have been hearing from the mayor and his senior officials."" Andy Lord, TfL's chief operating officer,said: ""We haven't proposed any changes to pensions or terms and conditions, and nobody has lost or will lose their jobs because of the proposals we have set out, so this action is completely unnecessary. ""We know our customers deserve better than this continued disruption and that is why we're urging the RMT to talk to us so we can find a resolution to this dispute which has already damaged London's recovery from the pandemic."" It doesn't seem there will be a resolution any time soon.  Sarah LeeBBC London Commuters face a fourth day of travel misery on Friday due to the knock-on impact of today's strike by 10,000 Tube workers. Transport for London (TfL) is warning that no Tube is expected to run until 08:00 GMT on Friday, similar to Wednesday morning after Tuesday's strike, with further disruption likely through the day. The RMT union's executive will meet to decide its next move in the bitter row, with further stoppages not being ruled out. Picket lines have been mounted outside Tube stations today and the union said its members were showing ""magnificent"" support for the industrial action. There were long queues again for buses and taxis, although not as bad as on Tuesday, as many people decided to work from home rather than spend hours trying to get to and from offices. Olivia DemetriadesBBC London Here are some of the travellers we've spoken to today... Here's the latest at the top of the hour, as 10,000 Tube workers strike and bring most London Underground lines to a standstill: No 10 has urged both sides in the Tube strikes to ""get around the table"" to resolve the issues at hand. Prime Minister Boris Johnson's official spokesman said: ""I think these ongoing strikes clearly are bringing misery to many Londoners, and we want both sides to get around the table and put an end to this disruptive action. ""It's a blow to businesses as they recover from Covid restrictions and it's stopping people from getting to work."" Transport for London (TfL) is already warning Londoners to prepare for more disruption to journeys tomorrow morning following todayâs Tube strike. Allow Twitter content?

Seven lines are now completely suspended, according to Transport for London (TfL). A little earlier, the Bakerloo Line began running a reduced service between Queen's Park and Elephant & Castle, but it seems that has now been suspended again. TfL'slive status page,externalsuggests only four lines are running infrequent services outside of central London. TfL Rail and trams are running as normal but Docklands Light Railway services are partly suspended. London Overground was already running a reduced service this week. Helen HoddinottJournalist Sisters Chi Chi and Chioma are at King's Cross waiting for an Uber to Covent Garden where they were hoping to take the Tube three stops to return some clothes. Chi Chioma says: ""The woman at the station said [the strikes] are because of poor working conditions and pay and stuff so I guess itâs fair enough but itâs a bit inconvenient as well."" Chi Chi says: ""We had to walk from the station, we were waiting for the bus, but it was so full, off the get go, loads of people just flocking to buses and I didnât really think it was Covid safe, so we just booked an Uber instead. But the traffic is quite bad so itâs been stuck on the same time for the last 10 or 15 minutes maybe. It was pricey, about Â£20."" Do the sisters have any sympathy for those on the picket line? ""I kind of get it, like itâs inconvenient for us,"" Chi Chi adds ""but itâs inconvenience for them as well because theyâre trying to work a job to get paid but theyâre still not being met with fair treatment so itâs understandable to be honest.""

But the emergency move did little to reassure stock and commodity markets with oil prices rising immediately after the decision was announced. Oil producing nations have rubber-stamped increasing output by 400,000 barrels of crude a month Energy market experts believe oil prices will remain high in the near-term. Markets are likely to remain volatile because major oil and gas companies, including BP and Shell, have announced plans to exit Russian operations and joint ventures. According to reports, customers of Russian oil are already facing difficulty over payments and shipping after the West's sanctions were imposed,blocking some Russian banks from global payment systems,external. ""In the short run, we are looking at a pretty serious run-up in prices. All this uncertainty about Russia, the potential threat of physical disruptions is making the markets nervous"" says Ben Cahill, a senior fellow at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. Traders suggest oil exporters have been offering Russia's highest-quality oil at a discount over the last few days but found few buyers. Russia is the world's third largest producer of oil, behind the United States and Saudi Arabia. It accounts for 8-10% of global oil supply. Europe relies on Russia for nearly 40% of its natural gas. So, given Russia's crucial position in the global energy market, the US and European Union have, so far, stopped short of imposing sanctions on Russia's oil and gas industries. The IEA will release 60 million barrels of oil from strategic petroleum reserves. Analysts say the group's decision to stick to its timetable - a gradual increase in production - has not come as a surprise, given its previous reluctance to deviate from steadily ramping-up output. Key members of Opec+ may fear that adding more supplies to the market at this stage could lead to an oversupply later in the year. A glut would bring down prices sharply. Energy experts believe that from the cartel's point of view little has changed yet in terms of physical supply on the market. And that prices have risen in direct response to uncertainty over the invasion. However, there have been some noticeable changes, buyers reluctant to purchase from Russia, for instance, are now switching to similar grades of Middle Eastern oil. ""Opec+ has always based its decisions on what the current data is showing them, rather than what the data will look like in the future due to geopolitical factors"" says Ahmed Mehdi, Analyst, Renaissance Energy Advisors, an energy research house. There may also be another reason Opec+ members are holding back. Negotiations to revive the 2015 Iran nuclear deal are widely expected to come to a head in March. If sanctions on oil-producer, Iran, are eased, then it could unlock Iranian oil exports. Mr Cahill believes that the deal could put the brakes on the oil rally, and bring down prices. ""The Iran deal is the wildcard: it could break the price momentum"" he says. If the oil price remains high then the cost of filling up a car will increase with it US president Joe Biden's administration, alarmed by rising fuel prices, has been putting pressure on key Opec member states, such as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), to turn on the taps, with little success. Russian President Vladimir Putin has also been in touch. During a call with Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan it is thought the two leaders discussed the Opec+ deal and pledged to continue coordination on global energy markets. The response to the Ukraine conflict from the Gulf States has, so far, been muted. Last week, the UAE, a close ally of the US in the region, abstainedduring the vote on a draft United Nations Security Council resolution condemning Moscow's actions,external. Analysts suggest Saudi Arabia and the UAE may be taking a more neutral stance to preserve co-operation with Russia on geopolitical and energy issues.

"Jess found it hard to talk about her eating disorder to her GP Two leading medical organisations have told the BBC that GPs are not getting the right support to treat eating disorders. The Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) and the British Medical Association (BMA) say doctors need more time with patients and more specialist units. It comes after a survey was conducted on GP experiences by the charity Beat. Over 92% asked thought their GP needed more training with eating disorders. Beat Eating Disorders asked nearly 1,700 people about their experience of trying to get a diagnosis from their GP. Out of those questioned, 69% also said they felt their GP didn't know how to help them. The survey has been released to coincide with Eating Disorder Awareness Week. Jess Griffiths had an eating disorder between the ages of 11 and 21 and, now in full recovery, she works as a consultant to NHS England and with her local eating disorder service in Dorset. She tells the BBC that when she first went to her GP to try to get help, she wasn't entirely transparent about what she was struggling with. ""I was presenting at a low weight and not having periods, so the GP put me on the pill, but I went there hoping he would ask me the questions [about a potential eating disorder]"" she says. ""But it's really hard for people with eating disorders to - in a really pressurised situation with a doctor - say how they really feel."" As part of a three-year training plan to become a GP, doctors have to complete training in mental health, which includes eating disorders. GPs need more time with patients and more specialist units to refer them to, say the BMA and RCGP This is on top of what's taught at medical school and the two years of post-graduate foundation training. Dr Richard Van Mellaerts is part of the BMA's GP committee and has told the BBC the results of the survey are ""deeply saddening"". ""People with eating disorders should never feel that GPs are a barrier to accessing care, so it is vital that medical education and training supports doctors to identify eating disorders and support their treatment,"" he says. But he adds that there is ""poor provision of specialist care"", which has left GPs ""frustrated up and down the country"". Pandemic and eating disorders â the awful impact Record number wait for eating disorder treatment The Royal College of GPs' vice-chairman Dr Gary Howsam says that what doctors need is longer appointments in order to provide the best possible care. ""Eating disorders, indeed all mental health conditions, are complex - they may also not be the primary reason a patient has made an appointment to see their GP,"" he says. ""The standard 10-minute appointment is inadequate for GPs to have the necessary conversations with patients, but offering longer appointments means offering fewer, and patients already report having to wait too long to access GP care."" Jess Griffiths agrees: ""I think GPs do an incredibly difficult job - they have to know a lot about illnesses, mental health conditions, and they are strapped for time. ""The workforce issue means we do struggle to provide that level of care needed in specialist services currently - so I can totally empathise,"" she says. Jess provides support to the charity Beat. Using her personal and professional experience, she has helped develop a training programme, which she thinks could be helpful for GPs who need more eating disorder support. ""We're providing resources to ensure that with the limited time GPs have, they can make an effective assessment and gain all the information they need to then know how to support a person."" She says it should be made easier for GPs to book eating disorder patients in for double or triple appointments, so they can get enough time together. ""The difficulty with eating disorder patients is they don't often present in a crisis, and they are generally not underweight, so it's not often visible what is going on. You need to get to the thought processes behind the mental illness and that definitely takes longer than 10 minutes,"" she says. In response to these comments, a Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: ""Eating disorders can be devastating for people living with them, and we want to ensure that everyone has access to the right support. ""We are working with partners - including Health Education England - to improve training for GPs, and with the General Medical Council to ensure newly qualified clinicians understand and know how to respond to eating disorders. ""We have invested Â£58 million this financial year to expand adult community mental health services, including those for eating disorders. This is on top of the additional Â£1 billion we are investing in community mental health care for adults with severe mental illness as part of the NHS Long Term Plan.""

"Thirty years ago when communism collapsed in the Soviet Union, Western firms stepped up their presence in Russia. The arrival of big Western companies symbolised the start of a new era with Russians becoming eager consumers of brands ranging from fast-food chain McDonalds to Levi jeans and luxury goods. Now, in the wake of President Putin's invasion of Ukraine, a growing number of firms have suspended activities in Russia. So which firms, in which sectors, are exiting and why have others held back? McDonald's, Coca-Cola, Starbucks and Heinekenare the latest companies to announce they are halting business in Russia after mounting pressure to act. McDonald's said it was temporarily closing its roughly 850 restaurants in Russia, while Starbucks also said its 100 coffee shops would shut. The firms were initially remained tight lipped over the conflict, but took action because shareholders ""wouldn't stand"" for the continued generation of profits from Russia, says Anna MacDonald, a fund manager at Amati Global Investors. ""It was affecting their share prices and the feeling was that it was just utterly inappropriate to continue to do so,"" she told the BBC. Pepsi, which has a much larger presence in Russia than rival Coca-Cola, said it was halting the production and sale of Pepsi and other global brands in Russia, but the company, which employs 20,000 people there, said it would continue to offer other products. Food companies Nestle, Mondelez, Procter & Gamble and Unilever have halted investment in Russia, but said they would continue providing essentials. British American Tobacco has announced it plans to sell its business in Russia due to it being ""no longer sustainable in the current environment"". The world's biggest cosmetics firm L'Oreal and rivalEstee Lauder are both closing shops,externaland ceasing online sales. Estee Lauder, whose brands include Michael Kors, DKNY, Clinique and Bobbi Brown, has had a presence in the country for about 30 years and Russia was where it had some of its strongest sales. In fact, Russia was the fifth largest European retail market globally last year, valued at Â£337.2bn. So some brands may not want to burn their bridges, if there's a chance of returning at a later date. That is why many firms, including other luxury retailers like Burberry and Chanel, simply say they are ""suspending"" sales and temporarily shutting stores rather than withdrawing altogether, says Chris Weafer, chief executive of consulting firm Macro-advisory Limited. With sanctions limiting forms of payment and huge uncertainty over future prices and consumer appetite, the business climate is ""extremely challenging"" he adds, making the decision to hit pause easier. The world's biggest fashion retailers H&M and Zara-owner Inditex,which has 502 stores in the country, for examplehave already suspended sales in Russia, citing ""tragic developments"" in Ukraine. Other brands like Nike have simply said they can't currently guarantee delivery of goods to customers in Russia. More brands are likely to follow suit, according to Maureen Hinton of retail consultancy GlobalData. Boohoo, Swedish furniture giant Ikea and Japanese clothing retailer Uniqlo which initially kept its 49 Russian stores open,saying clothes were a ""necessity of life"", are some of the other names to have now cut ties. Even Levi's, the jeans brand that became a symbol of post-Soviet business in Russia, has closed its shops.The all-American jeans firm said about,external4% of its total net sales came from Eastern Europe and Russia last year, but ""any business considerations are clearly secondary to the human suffering experienced by so many"". Samsung, the leading supplier of smartphones in Russia,has said it will suspend shipments to the country but has not said whether its shops will close. Japan's Sony and Nintendo suspended deliveries of gaming consoles, and Sony suspended the launch of racing game ""Gran Turismo 7"". Apple has also halted all of its product sales in Russia, andlimited other services such as Apple Pay and Apple Maps. Its shops have closed too. All shops under the Re:store in Moscow have been shut as Apple halts all product sales in Russia For a firm like Apple selling imported items, that's a relatively straightforward decision to take, suggests Macro-advisory's Chris Weafer. ""Companies do not want to be associated with the Russian regime and what's happening in Ukraine,"" he says. Their Russian business may be profitable, but ""the rest of the world is more important"" when it comes to reputational risk. Some tech companies, flooded by misinformation, are also restricting Kremlin-linked media outlets posting on their platforms.Facebook was blockedin Russia after it said it had refused to stop fact-checking and labelling content from state-owned news organisations. Meanwhile,TikTok has blocked all non-Russian content in Russia and suspended live streaming, although it is allowing historical content uploaded by domestic accounts to stay online, including videos by state-backed media services. Large consultancy and law firms were some of the first to set up a presence in Russia after the collapse of the Soviet Union but they mostly operate out of the spotlight. All of the Big Four accounting groups - Deloitte, KPMG, EY and PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) - have said they will no longer have a member firm in Russia because of the invasion. Top-tier law firm Freshfields says it will no longer work with any clients linked to the Russian state either. Others say they are reviewing their client base and Russian links. What sanctions are being imposed on Russia? How badly will Russia be hit by new sanctions? A senior executive for consultancy firm McKinsey, for example, wrote online that the company would ""no longer serve"" any government or state-owned entities in Russia. According to McKinsey's website, it serves 21 of the 30 biggest Russian companies. When the conflict in Ukraine broke out, energy firms came under immediate pressure. And that is set to intensify now the UK, US and UKhave announced bans or curbs on Russian oil and gas. BP owns a large stake in Russian energy giant Rosneft, but within days of the war starting ithad announcedthe operation would be hived off. That was closely followed bypledges from Shell,ExxonMobiland Equinor to cut their Russian investments following pressure from shareholders, as well as from governments and the public. A Rosneft oil rig drilling the first exploration well in the Khatanga Bay, Russia Firms want to be seen to be doing the ""right thing"", says Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell. Meanwhile, Total Energies, another big player in Russia, has said it won't fund new projects in the country, but unlike its peers does not plan to sell existing investments. It is still far from clear what will happen to those investments - whether they can eventually be sold, recouping some of their value, or if they will simply be written off at great cost. Film fans in Russia wanting to go and see Warner Bros' new blockbuster The Batman won't be able to after the companysuspended new film releases in the country. The US movie-maker was joined by Disney and Sony, with premieres of animation Turning Red and Marvel adaptation Morbius also being withdrawn. Disney has also paused its TV channels. Netflix, a fairly new entrant in Russia, has suspendedits service in the country and put all ""future projects"" on pause. Pixar's new animated film Turning Red won't be released in Russia All companies said their decisions were based on the ""humanitarian crisis"" in Ukraine, rather than as a result of sanctions that have been imposed. All three of the world's major record labels - Sony, Warner and Universal - have closed their offices in Russia, and Spotify has announced it is cancelling its subscription service, although the free, ad-funded version will still work. Payment giantsVisa, Mastercard, American Expressand PayPal are pulling out of the Russian market in protest. Russian banks have, however, already downplayed the impact of the announcements on their clients. Sberbank, for example, said that Visa and Mastercard-branded cards would continue to work on Russian territory because all payments in Russia are made through a national system. However, domestically issued cards won't work abroad, and foreign-issued ones won't work inside the country. US investment bankGoldman Sachs was the first Wall Street bank to say it was winding down its Russian business. The bank, soon followed by JPMorgan, said it was doing so in compliance with regulatory and licensing requirements. German lender Deutsche Bank, which had faced criticism for defending plans not to withdraw, has also said it was taking steps to exit, pledging ""there won't be any new business in Russia"". Jaguar Land Rover, General Motors, Aston Martin and Rolls-Royce are among the car-makers that have halted deliveries of vehicles to Russia due to the conflict, whileconstruction equipment manufacturer JCB has paused all operations. Jaguar Land Rover said sales were paused due to ""trading challenges"" Cars are the biggest UK export to Russia, but still only 1% of UK cars went to Russia last year. So any decision to stop exporting won't be particularly costly, and will have been made easier by nagging concerns over whether or not payments will arrive, says investment analyst Russ Mould. Transporting cars to Russia could prove difficult anyway, with the world's two largest cargo shipping companies, MSC and Maersk, suspending routes to and from Russia, except for food, medical and humanitarian supply deliveries. While the flood of announcements from companies stepping back goes on, there are calls for more to join them. Attention has turned to big food firms like Burger King who have condemned Russia's actions and have pledged support for Ukraine, but are yet to pull out. Some firms will also find it much harder to extricate themselves, even if pressure mounts in the coming days and weeks. In retaliation against sanctions introduced by Western countries, Moscow has banned the sale of Russian assets. So firms that, in recent years, have been encouraged to establish a presence in Russia are ""locked in"" with local businesses, staff and supply chains. Marks & Spencer, for example, has 48 shops in Russia but they are operated by a Turkish franchise company called FiBA. M&S has said it is suspending shipments of its goods to FiBA's Russian business, but the shops in the country remain open. Restaurant Brands International,which owns Burger King, told the BBC its Russian outlets were operated by franchiseeswith which it had ""long-standing legal agreements"" that were not easy to change. Yum Brands, which owns KFC and Pizza Hut, said it was suspending operations in the Russian KFC restaurants it owns, and finalising an agreement with its main franchisee to temporarily halt Pizza Hut operations. Mr Weafer predicts it is likely that some large consumer brands may express concerns over the military conflict, but try to ""ride it out"".
