"Businessman Luke Johnson says people are despairing and lockdowns are a ""blunt instrument"" which also have consequences Multiple business leaders have hit out at the looming prospect of a second national lockdown in England, saying the potential damage ""is immense"". Businessman Luke Johnson says the country cannot afford another lockdown. ""We [the UK] are over Â£2 trillion in debt now...and I think the government has neglected to account for the total loss of the lockdown,"" he says. The government maintains it has struck a balance between protecting jobs, the economy and saving lives. Mr Johnson adds: ""The damage to confidence, entrepreneurs, investors, the destruction of jobs, unemployment and the social and welfare costs are immense."" This week, the London Ambulance Service revealed that it is now attending an average of 37 suicides a day, or attempted suicides, up from 22 a day in 2019. ""I think that is a direct consequence of lockdown. People are losing their jobs, they are lonely, depressed, the mental health toll on the country is exponential,"" says Mr Johnson, who formerly ran Pizza Express, Patisserie Valerie and the Giraffe chain. ""I think it will be much worse this winter because people can't go out into the sunshine and treat it as an extended sabbatical. ""It's going to be much grimmer."" Stock markets sink amid alarm at Covid surge Covid: 1,700 employers planned redundancies in September Rishi Sunak to unveil new rescue deal for jobs and firms He says his main problem with the government's strategy is that there is no clear ""exit plan"" for the pandemic and coronavirus restrictions. ""Before we were told it was a few weeks, and there's a suspicion it could be a few months. If Christmas is cancelled, that's it for many businesses,"" warns Mr Johnson. Frances Bishop, 29, founded children's retail chain The Pud Store, based in South Yorkshire, five years ago. Entrepreneur Frances Bishop says she has never felt so alone as a business owner ""I feel like I'm in a dictatorship. I know they're saying they're reviewing the Tier 3 rules every 28 days, but there's been no communications from the council business groups on what they're basing these restrictions on,"" says Ms Bishop, who has three stores. ""It feels like you're being asked to operate a business, pay your taxes, pay your staff and try to keep your head above water, in a room that's on fire and clouded with smoke."" She says that a big problem is that stores are allowed to be open, but customers are not allowed to come, so footfall has ""fallen off a cliff"". The situation has had an impact on her mental health, and Ms Bishop says that she has never felt more alone as a business owner, at a time when her employees are looking to her for leadership and support. ""I'm watching my life's work be undone everyday and I'm throwing everything at it,"" she says. Charlie Mullins, boss of Pimlico Plumbers, says that the government ""needs to listen to businesses and people in the real world"". Pimlico Plumbers boss Charlie Mullins thinks the ""fear factor"" will do more damage to the economy than the pandemic He thinks another lockdown will ""finish many businesses off"", and is also concerned about the toll of coronavirus restrictions on people's wellbeing. ""They're basically going the wrong way about it. The virus is going to be here for a while, we've got to learn to work around it, we can't surrender to it,"" he tells the BBC. ""We need to protect the elderly and vulnerable, of course, but the rest of us need to get back to work."" His view strongly echoed that of Mr Johnson. Mr Mullins said his firm has attended over 200,000 house calls through the pandemic and not one employee or customer has caught the coronavirus. ""The last furlough scheme they did was too generous, it's created an atmosphere of, 'I want to work from home and stay at home',"" he says. ""Boris must stand firm and ignore the fear junkies who want to play Russian roulette with our economy."" Businesses have been telling the BBC since September that theyare worried about Christmas- traditionally the most important time of the year for the hospitality, retail and event industries. Hospitality firm boss Gary Forrest says closing venues at 10pm means people leave an environment that ensures their safety for one that doesn't ""People are trying to book Christmas parties, we don't know if we can accept them - it's tending towards being a total disaster. The hospitality industry cannot afford to have a poor December this year,"" says Gary Forrest, chief executive of the High Street Group, which owns a large chain of bars, restaurants and hotels across the north-east of England. Mr Forrest was particularly frustrated that pubs and restaurants such as his have invested in measures to protect their customers, but now the industry ""seems to be bearing the brunt of the government's restrictions"". ""They told us to bring in table service - and the cost of table service is huge, your salary costs go up exponentially - and all the technology changes, but then they still come along and say, 'now you still need to shut the bars at 10pm',"" he says. ""I'm worried about the 300 people we employ, who've got mortgages and rent to pay."" Mr Forrest wants to see a system where venues are certified by the local authorities and regularly checked to ensure compliance with safety rules. And he wants more support for firms and venues located in parts of the UK where restrictions are in place, but fall short of a full lockdown with mandatory closures. He says the support for businesses operating in this 'Tier 2' environment is not sufficient. But not all business leaders are against the government's coronavirus restrictions. Events firm owner Debbie Marks says we have to do what it takes to get through to the other side of the pandemic Debbie Marks is chief executive of Qube Events, one of the North's largest luxury event companies organising large scale weddings, corporate events, private parties and galas â and now Christmas decor specialists. ""We need the restrictions to be lifted on how many people can come to an event, because 15 people is really not viable for our industry - but we need to bring an end to the pandemic, so if having a lockdown is what we need, then that's what needs to be done."" Ms Marks says she already has an order book full of events starting from next March, and that the UK has to get through the pandemic to the other side so that the events industry can resume. However, she says that isn't possible without support from the government. ""I'm devastated about the support the government has not given our industry. We've been completely ignored, and we're a billion pound industry,"" she explains. A government spokesperson said: ""At all stages we have been guided by medical and scientific advice, and have taken the necessary action in order to rightly strike a balance between protecting jobs, the economy and saving lives. ""We have always been clear that we keep these measures under constant review so they do not have to be in place for any longer than is necessary.""

"The furlough scheme, which protected millions of jobs during the pandemic, is being wound up at the end of September. The government has been paying towards the wages of people who couldn't work, or whose employers could no longer afford to pay them, up to a monthly limit of Â£2,500. At first it paid 80% of the wages, but in August and September it paid 60%, with employers paying 20%. The most recent figures show1.6 million people were on furlough at the end of July- the lowest level since the start of the pandemic and 340,000 fewer than a month earlier. Nearlyone million workers were expected to still be on the scheme at the end of September, according to research by the Resolution Foundation. The numbers have dropped as the economy reopened. In May 2020, nearly nine million people were on furlough. What impact has the furlough scheme had? High numbers of workers in restaurants and hotels were furloughed Some employers with workers on furlough may find they cannot afford to keep them on when furlough ends. International travel, and other businesses which depend on it, are still seriously disrupted. Some furloughed workers in these areas may lose their jobs. Many forecasters, including the Bank of England, are expecting a small rise in unemployment. How many people could lose their jobs? How do I find a new job and who is hiring? If you were made redundant while on furlough, you have a number of legal rights. The selection process must be fair, you must be given notice, and you are entitled to tax-free redundancy pay. Government guidance: Furlough and redundancy,external Government guidance: Redundancy and benefits,external What are my rights if I am made redundant? If you've been made redundant - or been told that you will soon be made redundant - there are three main types of financial support that you may be entitled to: Universal credit,external New Style Jobseeker's Allowance,external(New Style JSA), or New Style Employment and Support Allowance,external(New Style ESA) You might be able to claim a combination of these benefits. The amount of help you get depends on your personal circumstances, including the amount of national insurance contributions you made while you were employed. You may be entitled to extra money if you have children or are a carer, or have a disability or health condition. You may also be entitled to help with housing costs. There is lots of free benefits guidance and advice available, including: There are a number offree online benefits calculators,externalfrom organisations includingentitledto,external,Turn2Us,external, andPolicy in Practice,external TheMoney Navigator tool,externalfrom the Money and Pensions Service relates to coronavirus-related money matters Further guidance is available fromCitizens Advice,externaland from theLow Incomes Tax Reform Group,external The government says 11.6 million jobs have been supported by the scheme. From March 2020 to the end of September 2021, the cost of furlough will come to about Â£66bn, according to estimates from the Office for Budget Responsibility. That's a huge sum, around one fifth of the money the government has spent on the response to Covid. The Chancellor, Rishi Sunak, launched the furlough scheme in March 2020 However, the scheme has undoubtedly helped to save millions of jobs. At the start of the pandemic it was feared that more than one in 10 workers would become unemployed. Instead the unemployment rate is currently less than one in 20. VACCINE:When will I get my jab?

"Nuclear weapon. Misery. Disaster. That's what he called it. And yet that is what he has done. Boris Johnson made absolutely no bones about his reluctance to act to instruct England to close its doors again in recent weeks. On Saturday evening, he was at pains to claim that lockdown 2.0 in England will be not nearly as restrictive as first time round. But again, the prime minister stood at the lectern and told us to ""stay at home, protect the NHS, save lives"". Again, he warned the public that if the government didn't take draconian action then the health service would have to turn patients who need care away. Again, he and his top scientists presented evidence that the country could face an intolerable number of deaths during a wave of the pandemic that has turned our lives upside down in the last eight months. The prime minister's defence to the country, just squeezing a televised public briefing into the Halloween prime time TV schedules after a few hours of delay, was a well-worn political standby - when the facts change, it is the right thing to change course. It is true that data shared by the government on Saturday points to a prognosis that has worsened. One key document shows several UK daily death projections by different modellers, compared with the first wave and the government's ""reasonable worst-case scenario"" - which was seen in a report in August The UK is not the only country that has seen the progress of the disease go the wrong way, with France and Germany acting in recent days. But it is also true that Mr Johnson cannot say for a second that he was not warned. More than six weeks ago, not just the opposition, but some of Mr Johnson's own ministers, and some of his own advisers were pushing for another limited lockdown to try to slow the spread of the disease. Conversations were active in government by the third week in September about the possibility of taking national action as the second wave was developing, potentially in a more serious way than the scale of the pandemic in the spring. The PM decided at that point to plump instead for a local lockdown system, in the hope of controlling the spread without taking a hammer to the whole of the fragile economy only starting to get back to life. He chose to side with the Treasury and many newly assertive Tory backbenchers. As that tier system stuttered into life, complete with clashes with the local leaders around the country, conversations continued on and off about the possibility of a short, sharp, limited lockdown, or ""circuit-breaker"". Still, publicly, while those discussions continued, day after day ministers insisted the tier plan could and would work. The decisions were never simple. There was a logic to trying to resist taking more draconian action like this to try to limit the damage to the economy, the other terrible effects of lockdown. But Mr Johnson's original judgement now seems like it was a political accident just waiting to happen. Lockdown 2.0 is not an exact replica of first time round. There are notable differences - with schools, colleges and universities staying open, a fixed time limit of a month and, perhaps the most vital of all, the hope of a rapid acceleration of mass testing to make life with the virus more liveable. The picture is also different in different corners of the UK. Scotland is sticking to its new tiered approach for now, where there have been tighter regional restrictions for a while. Northern Ireland and Wales are also both already in forms of a second lockdown, with plans already for their exit. But something is very familiar. Having waited until this moment, the PM has again, just like in the spring, left himself open to the accusation that he delayed the inevitable, and the timing of his decisions is costly, perhaps to lives, and likely the government's own reputation.

"Donald Trump, Joe Biden, and their running mates criss-cross the country wooing voters three days ahead of the 3 November election Barack Obama joins forces with Biden in Michigan Trump targets the crucial battleground state of Pennsylvania While Trump and Biden campaign in northern states, Mike Pence is in North Carolina and Kamala Harris is in Florida Some 90 million people have already voted ahead of election day on Tuesday The country is course for its highest electoral turnout rate in more than a century On Friday the US once again broke its daily coronavirus record with more than 94,000 new cases Edited by Boer Deng Stevie Wonder performed for Biden in Detroit  Thanks for following our live coverage of the 2020 US election campaign on this Halloween Saturday. Some highlights from this frantic day of campaigning three days before election day: Our team will be back in the morning to bring you the latest news and features. Biden will be speaking in Pennsylvania while Trump is due to attend events in five different states. Today's live updates were brought to you by Boer Deng, Max Matza, Patrick Jackson and Helier Cheung. Police have used pepper spray to break up an anti-racist march to a polling station in a small town in North Carolina, local media report. At least 12 people were arrested,external, including a journalist, in the town of Graham, Alamance County, the News & Observer reports. Police had escorted the 200 or so marchers, who included local Democratic politicians, from a church to the town's Court Square, where a rally was held to encourage people to turn out and vote. But at one point police began clearing the road, and pepper spray was fired, with several young children affected. It is unclear how many marchers were unable to cast their ballots at the polling station, where the last day of early voting was under way. Faith Cook, one of the few marchers to make it to the polling station, told the paper: âIâve never experienced anything like that. Nobody should have to."" A quirky new poll out from YouGov and the Daily Show comedy programme has asked American voters some unusual questions, and heard back some equally strange answers. For instance, more Americans think Biden can be trusted to carve a turkey dinner or help them with their taxes over Trump - who famously has refused to release his tax returns. They also think the Democrat would be better at helping you get over a romantic breakup or run a doggy daycare centre. Trump, Americans say, would be better at recording a rap song or mixing a cosmopolitan cocktail over Biden. But more Americans say they would turn to the thrice-married president for help setting up an online dating profile or solving a computer problem. Reality Check President Trump has criticised plans to expand postal voting in the election, claiming it leads to widespread fraud - but what evidence is there? The US is in uncharted territory during the coronavirus pandemic as a record number of Americans vote by post. Election authorities and the postal service have been put under immense strain processing the millions of extra ballots. This has led to claims the system is unsafe and susceptible to manipulation. Numerous national and state-level studies have shown that although there have been isolated cases, electoral fraud is very rare. There have been a few, well-publicised cases, such as in the 2018 North Carolina primary, which was re-run after a consultant for the Republican candidate tampered with voting papers. But the rate of voting fraud overall in the US is less than 0.0009%, according to a 2017 study by the Brennan Center for Justice. And Federal Election Commission head Ellen Weintraub has said: ""There's simply no basis for the conspiracy theory that voting by mail causes fraud."" Read the full analysis, and more on places where fraud has been claimed this year, here. Trump and Biden are each now holding events A frenzied day of campaigning for Donald Trump and Joe Biden continues now as the rivals hold simultaneous events in two different swing states. Trump is due to appear in Butler, Pennsylvania - the third of four events he has in the state today - after earlier turning up in Newtown, a suburb of Philadelphia, and Reading, a bit further west. There, he joked about his family's recent brush with coronavirus. Both the president and first lady caught the virus, and Trump spent several days in hospital before recovering. Of their diagnoses, he said: ""At least those rumours that we don't live together proved to be false"". Meanwhile, Biden is due to turn up in Detroit, Michigan for his second rally of the day with help from his former boss, Barack Obama. He is due to get an extra boost from another special guest: Stevie Wonder. For a bit of Halloween fun, outspoken singer Lizzo has revealed her risque but zeitgeist-y costume - and no it's not a Trump wig. The Biden campaigner posted an image where she donned black wigs and insect eyes and was photoshopped onto Vice-President Mike Pence's head. The outfit is a reference to the fly that sat on Pence's head for over a minute during the vice-presidential debate. The incident sparked memes aplenty and led Biden to pose for a photo with a fly-swatter. Some businesses near the White House have been boarded up Students at the George Washington University in the US capital have reportedly been advised to stock up on essential goods like food and prescription medicines ahead of election day. Warning students living on or near campus of""potential disruptions... during the election period"",external, it advised them to have supplies for at least one week, a WTOP Radio report says, quoting a spokesperson. According to the radio, the advice is to ""prepare for election season as they would for a hurricane or blizzard"". Election day itself is designated a holiday by the university. Businesses in the city have been boarding up doors and windows as a precaution against rioting after the election results are announced. Every 30 seconds, a Latino in the US turns 18 and becomes eligible to vote. If they turn out, young Latino voters could swing the outcome of the election. Little wonder that both the Trump and Biden campaigns are eager to court them. BBC spoke to five first-time Latino voters from around the country to find out what issues they care most about - and of course, which presidential candidate they will be voting for. This video can not be played US election: What Latino first-time voters want Vice-President Mike Pence has spoken at a rally at the airport in Elizabeth City, North Carolina. ""We need North Carolina to show America that this is Trump country,"" he told supporters in the swing state. The attack continued the Trump campaign's strategy - painting Biden as corrupted by foreign powers. Biden's campaign denies any wrongdoing and claims that it is actually the Trump family that is guilty of influence peddling. ""Joe Biden has been a cheerleader for communist China all along,"" Pence claimed. He also called for voters to boot out the Democratic governor whose Covid-19 restrictions spoilt Republican plans to host their party conference there during the pandemic. Ebun Ekunwe voted for Trump in 2016 and Biden in 2020. BBC has been speaking to voters around the US to get their perspectives on the 2020 election. Ebun Ekunwe, 72, is a retired doctor and an associate pastor at her local church in Carrollton, Texas. She voted for Donald Trump in 2016 but now believes âthe man who promised to drain the swamp has only succeeded in poisoning the waters.â âI voted my conscience,â she said. âHe has spent four years upending the first letter of the Constitution: instead of 'We the People' he has made it 'Me the People.' Iâm keeping my fingers crossed that, with people fully energised like never before, we can turn it back to 'We the People.'â She queued early to vote for Joe Biden at her neighbourhood polling station, the public library. She cast her vote for the Democrat ânot because of his policies, but because civility matters to me.â Ebun is a member of our voter panel.You'll be hearing more from our other panelists throughout the week. More on the theme of Halloween today: a viral TikTok video of two twin girls in Oklahoma is drawing in eyeballs, after their mother dressed them as presidential candidates for Halloween. Four-year-olds Haven and Koti were born right before the 2016 election, their mother told KFOR-TV. âThey know they were Joe Biden and Donald Trump and see them on TV talking all the time, so they know theyâre somebody. I donât think they understand quite yet who they are,â said mum Adrea Garza. Garza told Good Morning America some people had criticised her costume choice for her girls, saying they should have dressed up as princesses instead. Her response? ""There's nothing wrong with dressing as a princess. My girls do it all the time. But there's nothing wrong with dressing as the president of the United States either."" As we mentioned earlier, a photo of two girls dressed up as Kamala Harris and her sister also delighted many -including Harris's younger sister, Maya,external. Building a ""big, beautiful wall"" between the US and Mexico was the signature promise of President Donald Trump's 2016 election campaign. A concrete barrier, he said, would serve to stop what he described as a flow of illegal immigrants and drugs over the border. But what actually happened to the wall? How much of it has been built? And how effective has it been? The BBC's Lucy Rodgers and Dominic Bailey have put togethersome charts and graphics to help explain.  Melania Trump made her second solo appearance of the 2020 campaign today in Wisconsin. She delivered pre-prepared lines from beneath a chandelier inside a packed barn. ""Joe Biden says he could do a better job leading our great nation,"" she said. ""Apparently when you hide in a basement, you feel safe communicating your wishful thinking.â The attack line echoes her husband's claim that Biden's effort to avoid people, which Biden says is due to social distancing measures made necessary due to the virus, keeps him ""hiding in the basement"". In addition to ""sleepy Joe,"" Trump occasionally has called him ""hidin' Biden"".  Biden dismissed the joke earlier today by tweeted a photo of one of his drive-in rallies. Unlike at Trump rallies, guests mostly socially distance and wear masks at Biden events. The first lady will giving more remarks in Pennsylvania, the ""keystone state"", later today, where her husband is campaigning. It's that kind of election year in America... some businesses in cities have been boarding up their doors and windows as a precaution against possible violent protests after Tuesday's vote. As we mentioned earlier, one poll suggests that nearly 56% of US voters are worried the presidential election will lead to an increase in violence. Workers covered the windows at The Hay-Adams hotel in Washington DC Boards covering the door of one office near the White House bear the slogan ""Black Lives Matter"" In New York City, plywood protects windows on a Macy's department store Businesses in Chicago began boarding up weeks ago in anticipation of election unrest California Senator Kamala Harris, the Democratic vice-presidential pick, is in the Miami area today. Harris appeared at her first of three events of the day with rapper Fat Joe and celebrity chef Jose AndrÃ©s. She encouraged the audience to vote, and slammed Trump's handling of the coronavirus. Democrats fret that early voters may not be turning out in Florida in the numbers needed for Biden to win the crucially important state. Meanwhile, Vice-President Mike Pence is in North Carolina, another swing state, for two events today. There, Republicans are nervous. Ready to run... astronaut Mark Kelly, football coach Tommy Tuberville and trucker Kelly Loeffler ""An astronaut, a pastor and an American football coach walk into the US Senate"" sounds like the opening to a joke, but that is what could happen when winners of the 2020 general election take their seats in Congress. While attention has been hyper-focused on the battle for the White House, an equally important fight is underway for control of Washington. Here are a few of the candidates to keep an eye on:  Read more: The five Senate races to watch Tangier Island, a part of Virginia, is slowly disappearing due to erosion and rising water levels, but this US community of fishermen is putting its faith in a sea wall - and President Trump - to protect their homes, jobs and way of life.

This video can not be played US election: The sinking island voting for President Trump The first of two Biden Michigan rallies is wrapping up before the 2020 Democratic nominee heads to Detroit with his old boss, Barack Obama. In his first appearance stumping for his former vice-president, Obama compared Donald Trump's character to Biden's. ""It used to be that being a man meant taking care of other people... not looking for credit but trying to live right..."" Obama said. ""When you elect Joe, that's what you'll see reflected from the White House."" Taking the stage, Biden paid tribute to Obama, saying his eight years in the White House had been free from scandal. ""It's time for Donald Trump to pack his bags and go home,"" he said. ""We're done with the chaos."" BBC has been speaking to voters around the US to get their perspectives on the 2020 election.

He condemned President Donald Trump's handling of the coronavirus pandemic, saying his main concern seemed to be the size of the crowds at his rallies.

Faith Cook, one of the few marchers to make it to the polling station, told the paper: âIâve never experienced anything like that. Nobody should have to."" A quirky new poll out from YouGov and the Daily Show comedy programme has asked American voters some unusual questions, and heard back some equally strange answers. For instance, more Americans think Biden can be trusted to carve a turkey dinner or help them with their taxes over Trump - who famously has refused to release his tax returns. They also think the Democrat would be better at helping you get over a romantic breakup or run a doggy daycare centre. Trump, Americans say, would be better at recording a rap song or mixing a cosmopolitan cocktail over Biden. But more Americans say they would turn to the thrice-married president for help setting up an online dating profile or solving a computer problem. Reality Check President Trump has criticised plans to expand postal voting in the election, claiming it leads to widespread fraud - but what evidence is there? The US is in uncharted territory during the coronavirus pandemic as a record number of Americans vote by post. Election authorities and the postal service have been put under immense strain processing the millions of extra ballots. This has led to claims the system is unsafe and susceptible to manipulation. Numerous national and state-level studies have shown that although there have been isolated cases, electoral fraud is very rare. There have been a few, well-publicised cases, such as in the 2018 North Carolina primary, which was re-run after a consultant for the Republican candidate tampered with voting papers. But the rate of voting fraud overall in the US is less than 0.0009%, according to a 2017 study by the Brennan Center for Justice. And Federal Election Commission head Ellen Weintraub has said: ""There's simply no basis for the conspiracy theory that voting by mail causes fraud."" Read the full analysis, and more on places where fraud has been claimed this year, here. Trump and Biden are each now holding events A frenzied day of campaigning for Donald Trump and Joe Biden continues now as the rivals hold simultaneous events in two different swing states. Trump is due to appear in Butler, Pennsylvania - the third of four events he has in the state today - after earlier turning up in Newtown, a suburb of Philadelphia, and Reading, a bit further west. There, he joked about his family's recent brush with coronavirus. Both the president and first lady caught the virus, and Trump spent several days in hospital before recovering. Of their diagnoses, he said: ""At least those rumours that we don't live together proved to be false"". Meanwhile, Biden is due to turn up in Detroit, Michigan for his second rally of the day with help from his former boss, Barack Obama. He is due to get an extra boost from another special guest: Stevie Wonder. For a bit of Halloween fun, outspoken singer Lizzo has revealed her risque but zeitgeist-y costume - and no it's not a Trump wig. The Biden campaigner posted an image where she donned black wigs and insect eyes and was photoshopped onto Vice-President Mike Pence's head. The outfit is a reference to the fly that sat on Pence's head for over a minute during the vice-presidential debate. The incident sparked memes aplenty and led Biden to pose for a photo with a fly-swatter. Some businesses near the White House have been boarded up Students at the George Washington University in the US capital have reportedly been advised to stock up on essential goods like food and prescription medicines ahead of election day. Warning students living on or near campus of""potential disruptions... during the election period"",external, it advised them to have supplies for at least one week, a WTOP Radio report says, quoting a spokesperson. According to the radio, the advice is to ""prepare for election season as they would for a hurricane or blizzard"". Election day itself is designated a holiday by the university. Businesses in the city have been boarding up doors and windows as a precaution against rioting after the election results are announced. Every 30 seconds, a Latino in the US turns 18 and becomes eligible to vote. If they turn out, young Latino voters could swing the outcome of the election. Little wonder that both the Trump and Biden campaigns are eager to court them. BBC spoke to five first-time Latino voters from around the country to find out what issues they care most about - and of course, which presidential candidate they will be voting for. This video can not be played US election: What Latino first-time voters want Vice-President Mike Pence has spoken at a rally at the airport in Elizabeth City, North Carolina. ""We need North Carolina to show America that this is Trump country,"" he told supporters in the swing state. The attack continued the Trump campaign's strategy - painting Biden as corrupted by foreign powers. Biden's campaign denies any wrongdoing and claims that it is actually the Trump family that is guilty of influence peddling. ""Joe Biden has been a cheerleader for communist China all along,"" Pence claimed. He also called for voters to boot out the Democratic governor whose Covid-19 restrictions spoilt Republican plans to host their party conference there during the pandemic. Ebun Ekunwe voted for Trump in 2016 and Biden in 2020. BBC has been speaking to voters around the US to get their perspectives on the 2020 election. Ebun Ekunwe, 72, is a retired doctor and an associate pastor at her local church in Carrollton, Texas. She voted for Donald Trump in 2016 but now believes âthe man who promised to drain the swamp has only succeeded in poisoning the waters.â âI voted my conscience,â she said. âHe has spent four years upending the first letter of the Constitution: instead of 'We the People' he has made it 'Me the People.' Iâm keeping my fingers crossed that, with people fully energised like never before, we can turn it back to 'We the People.'â She queued early to vote for Joe Biden at her neighbourhood polling station, the public library. She cast her vote for the Democrat ânot because of his policies, but because civility matters to me.â Ebun is a member of our voter panel.You'll be hearing more from our other panelists throughout the week. More on the theme of Halloween today: a viral TikTok video of two twin girls in Oklahoma is drawing in eyeballs, after their mother dressed them as presidential candidates for Halloween. Four-year-olds Haven and Koti were born right before the 2016 election, their mother told KFOR-TV. âThey know they were Joe Biden and Donald Trump and see them on TV talking all the time, so they know theyâre somebody. I donât think they understand quite yet who they are,â said mum Adrea Garza. Garza told Good Morning America some people had criticised her costume choice for her girls, saying they should have dressed up as princesses instead. Her response? ""There's nothing wrong with dressing as a princess. My girls do it all the time. But there's nothing wrong with dressing as the president of the United States either."" As we mentioned earlier, a photo of two girls dressed up as Kamala Harris and her sister also delighted many -including Harris's younger sister, Maya,external. Building a ""big, beautiful wall"" between the US and Mexico was the signature promise of President Donald Trump's 2016 election campaign. A concrete barrier, he said, would serve to stop what he described as a flow of illegal immigrants and drugs over the border. But what actually happened to the wall? How much of it has been built? And how effective has it been? The BBC's Lucy Rodgers and Dominic Bailey have put togethersome charts and graphics to help explain.  Melania Trump made her second solo appearance of the 2020 campaign today in Wisconsin. She delivered pre-prepared lines from beneath a chandelier inside a packed barn. ""Joe Biden says he could do a better job leading our great nation,"" she said. ""Apparently when you hide in a basement, you feel safe communicating your wishful thinking.â The attack line echoes her husband's claim that Biden's effort to avoid people, which Biden says is due to social distancing measures made necessary due to the virus, keeps him ""hiding in the basement"". In addition to ""sleepy Joe,"" Trump occasionally has called him ""hidin' Biden"".  Biden dismissed the joke earlier today by tweeted a photo of one of his drive-in rallies. Unlike at Trump rallies, guests mostly socially distance and wear masks at Biden events. The first lady will giving more remarks in Pennsylvania, the ""keystone state"", later today, where her husband is campaigning. It's that kind of election year in America... some businesses in cities have been boarding up their doors and windows as a precaution against possible violent protests after Tuesday's vote. As we mentioned earlier, one poll suggests that nearly 56% of US voters are worried the presidential election will lead to an increase in violence. Workers covered the windows at The Hay-Adams hotel in Washington DC Boards covering the door of one office near the White House bear the slogan ""Black Lives Matter"" In New York City, plywood protects windows on a Macy's department store Businesses in Chicago began boarding up weeks ago in anticipation of election unrest California Senator Kamala Harris, the Democratic vice-presidential pick, is in the Miami area today. Harris appeared at her first of three events of the day with rapper Fat Joe and celebrity chef Jose AndrÃ©s. She encouraged the audience to vote, and slammed Trump's handling of the coronavirus. Democrats fret that early voters may not be turning out in Florida in the numbers needed for Biden to win the crucially important state. Meanwhile, Vice-President Mike Pence is in North Carolina, another swing state, for two events today. There, Republicans are nervous. Ready to run... astronaut Mark Kelly, football coach Tommy Tuberville and trucker Kelly Loeffler ""An astronaut, a pastor and an American football coach walk into the US Senate"" sounds like the opening to a joke, but that is what could happen when winners of the 2020 general election take their seats in Congress. While attention has been hyper-focused on the battle for the White House, an equally important fight is underway for control of Washington. Here are a few of the candidates to keep an eye on:  Read more: The five Senate races to watch Tangier Island, a part of Virginia, is slowly disappearing due to erosion and rising water levels, but this US community of fishermen is putting its faith in a sea wall - and President Trump - to protect their homes, jobs and way of life.

This video can not be played US election: The sinking island voting for President Trump The first of two Biden Michigan rallies is wrapping up before the 2020 Democratic nominee heads to Detroit with his old boss, Barack Obama. In his first appearance stumping for his former vice-president, Obama compared Donald Trump's character to Biden's. ""It used to be that being a man meant taking care of other people... not looking for credit but trying to live right..."" Obama said. ""When you elect Joe, that's what you'll see reflected from the White House."" Taking the stage, Biden paid tribute to Obama, saying his eight years in the White House had been free from scandal. ""It's time for Donald Trump to pack his bags and go home,"" he said. ""We're done with the chaos."" BBC has been speaking to voters around the US to get their perspectives on the 2020 election. Keirsten Greggs, 44, is a talent recruiter from Fairfax, Virginia.We featured her on a panel of voters during the first presidential debate, when she still had hope Joe Biden would earn her vote. In the end, he didn't win her vote. Keirsten waited in a two-hour queue and cast a protest vote for Charlotta Bass - the first black woman to own and operate a newspaper. âThereâs a notion that black women are going to save America. But not me. Not this black woman.â âIf the governor of Maryland can write-in a vote for a dead person [Ronald Reagan], I can make a symbolic vote too.â Obama at the drive-in event in Flint Barack Obama has been warming up the Democratic faithful at a drive-in rally in Flint, Michigan, ahead of Joe Biden's appearance as the party's candidate in Tuesday's presidential election. ""You can choose change,"" Obama said to the beeping of horns. ""You can choose a better America."" He condemned President Donald Trump's handling of the coronavirus pandemic, saying his main concern seemed to be the size of the crowds at his rallies. ""What Joe will do is get this pandemic under control,"" Obama said. Obama served as president from 2009 to 2017, while Biden served as his vice-president.  Â© 2025 BBC.

He has been around leaders his whole life, when he was born with his dad. He knows how to lead men, he has seen it, he's learned it, he's lived it. He is a really good bloke off the field and I think that is what the best leaders are. They are able to be good humans off the field and understand you as a person, not just a rugby player. And when you're on the field they lead by example and demand the highest standards. Ugo MonyeFormer England winger on BBC Radio 5 Live It is a magic day for England. Any day you win a Six Nations title is, of course, but it is made more special by the debutants they had and Jamie George and Ben Youngs. Ben has been incredible. We often try to select our national team based on club form and his form for Leicester hasn't always been great for the past couple of years. But whenever he has put on an England jersey he's been incredinle.to be only the second Englishman to reach that achievement is fantastic. England 34-5 Italy England didn't have it all that easy against Italy in the first half. The home side also seemed to be super pumped for the game.

Jamie HeaslipFormer Ireland number eight on BBC Radio 5 Live If England and France are playing now I think England might be the favourites. I think France are playing a better style of rugby but that is not the rugby which is rewarded right now, particularly in the Northern Hemisphere. That is why I think England are slightly the better side. Ugo MonyeFormer England winger on BBC Radio 5 Live I often think when you select certain players it is an indication of how you want to play. Anthony Watson came off after 60 minutes, I'd love to see his numbers, I reckon he carried twice. What's the point? You might as well select another back row player out on the wing to do that job if it is just a kick-chase job. Either way it is effective. France 35-27 Ireland Jacob Stockdale went over for a very late consolation for Ireland. He was guilty of some poor handling errors in Paris. France 35-27 Ireland Another silky smooth France move resulted in a try for Virimi Vakatawa of Racing 92. England win the Six Nations Martin JohnsonFormer England captain and coach on BBC One England are in a similar position to many ways, they've got an experienced team, they made a World Cup final but there's an opportunity for some younger guys to come through. We saw some come on today against Italy and there's other players that people are talking about and, as a coach, if you've got difficult selections in terms of you've got a lot of good players, that's a nice place to be. The other alternative is that you haven't got good players and you're trying to find someone to fill a slot. There is opportunity there for players to come through. Ben Youngs has played 100 games for England, he's been first choice scrum half for 10 years so we need the next guy, the next two guys to be coming through because we know you're only one incident away from losing that guy for six months so I think Eddie Jones will also take this opportunity to give guys a chance. FT: France 35-27 Ireland Ireland's Johnny Sexton on BBC One:""France took their opportunities really well, sometimes off nothing, sometimes off our mistakes. We weren't ruthless enough when we had the chance to score. we had a few chances five metres out and had a chance to go for the try, a brave decision to go for the try before half time, but we weren't accurate enough and it's going to be tough to look over for the next week or so."" On Cian Healy winning his 100th cap:""It's an amazing achievement by Cian and I wish we could have won the game and we saw the other results and knew we needed to win by six or by a bonus point so we tried to do. mixture and go for brave calls and get a try. we felt there was some space to exploit but we weren't good enough to take it."" On the Autumn Nations Cup: ""We're looking forward to a new competition, today is going to hurt but we've got some very important players coming back for us and some new players to come in so we're looking forward to getting back and trying to bounce back from this disappointment."" Ugo MonyeFormer England winger on BBC Radio 5 Live In terms of an evolution and getting ahead of the curve, what I would like to see more from England is perhaps a little bit more ambition. Eddie Jones was quick to talk about a privilege to put on the jersey and put a smile on people's faces. I wasn't smiling watching a ball being kicked, it was a game of kick tennis. It was effective - but it was against Italy. France 35-27 Ireland It was magic feet from Robbie Henshaw, who may just skip over the rest of the match when he gets home to watch his try. England win the Six Nations Martin JohnsonFormer England captain and coach on BBC One I think it's about right - these three teams definitely looked the best. France coming back and playing this rugby is brilliant for the tournament. Scotland beat Wales today and they won't care what the game looked like, people were saying it was ugly game but once you've not beat someone for some a long time it's just about winning and cracking on. I'm already looking forward to England v France next year. England will pick up the trophy tomorrow but they'll be thinking they've blown a Grand Slam because they played poorly in Paris in the first half and didn't really compete as we know. Ugo MonyeFormer England winger on BBC Radio 5 Live I don't just want to be seduced by the way they play but when you look at the composition of their team, France have almost everything. Gregory Aldritt won the player of the match again - I think that is his third of the tournament - he has been incredible. Â© 2025 BBC.

"This video can not be played Prime Minister Boris Johnson: ""Now is the time to take action"" The Premier League and other elite sport can continue behind closed doors during anew four-week national lockdownin England. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has announced new restrictions for the country that will start on Thursday and run until 2 December to combat coronavirus and avoid the NHS being overwhelmed. Culture secretary Oliver Dowdentweeted that,external""travel to a place of work will be permitted"" for ""elite sport played behind closed doors"". During a news conference to announce the measures, Johnson gave a thumbs up and said ""Yes to the Premier League"" when asked if top-flight football will continue. The Premier League was halted in March before the first national lockdown and has been played without fans since it restarted in June. Players are tested weekly for the virus. The English Football League says it has been told by the government that its competitions can continue in England and Wales. ""We acknowledge the government's national efforts in tackling this outbreak and would hope that during this next phase of the crisis, our national sport, negatively affected by Covid-19 like many other industries, can continue to provide some form of welcome distraction and give people in our communities up and down the country a sense of normality in very challenging times,"" the EFL said in a statement. It is not clear how grassroots and amateur sport will be affected, but guidance is being drawn up. However sources have indicated to BBC Sport that is unlikely that grassroots team sport will be permitted to continue. Nine of the 40FA Cup first round tiesdue to be played over 6-9 November involve teams from ""non-elite"" leagues. The Football Association says it is ""awaiting further information before we can confirm how this may affect non-elite football across England"". Under the new restrictions: People are being told to stay at home unless they have a specific reason to leave, such as work which cannot be done from home and education. People are allowed to exercise outdoors alone, with their household or with one other person. The government has confirmed leisure centres and gyms will close, as will other indoor and outdoor leisure facilities including: sports facilities including swimming pools, golf courses and driving ranges, bowling alleys, dance studios, stables and riding centres, climbing walls and climbing centres, archery and shooting ranges. Read full restrictions here,external The Lawn Tennis Association says that, while indoor tennis will be halted, it will ""make a case"" to the government for outdoor tennis between two individuals from different households to be allowed in line with restrictions on exercise, adding that tennis is a ""socially distanced sport with the net acting as a natural barrier"". The Sport and Recreation Alliance, which represents UK national sports organisations including the Football Association and Rugby Football Union along with community sport, has called for ""urgent support"" from the government. Chief executive Lisa Wainwright said: ""These restrictions will critically affect the 150,000 plus local sports clubs in every community across England and will place them in a perilous scenario not knowing if they will ever open their doors again"" adding it could be the ""final nail in the coffin for grassroots clubs which have struggled to survive the initial lockdown"". Swim England chief executive Jane Nickerson said her organisation thought it was ""extremely disappointing and frustrating to see indoor leisure being forced to close again,"" adding that pools were a ""safe and a lifeline for many people"" and should be ""considered an essential service"". ""A second period of closure will push many facilities over the edge and there is the dangerous prospect of losing so many facilities for good,"" she said. Nickerson urged the government to ""dig deep and find the necessary funding to ensure we don't see swimming pools and other leisure facilities permanently close"". UK Active, a non-for-profit body representing gyms and leisure centres said it was ""deeply concerned"" by the new measures. In a statement, it said: ""We urge the Prime Minister to ensure comprehensive financial support for the health and fitness sector is available to help it survive this period, minimising the now grave threat to further business failure and significant job losses."" Speaking after his side's 2-1 win over West Ham, Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp said: ""It is obviously what we wanted (football to continue) and I think we proved we can keep the bubble safe. ""Everyone had cases, that is the time we are in, but we could isolate these cases pretty quickly to prevent spread. ""I think it never happened at a training ground but it has happened when travelling, with international teams, normal life. I think we proved we can do it. ""And in a lockdown it is really important for the people that they can do things they like to do, and watching football is obviously something they like to do. I am happy we can continue."" BBC Sports editor Dan Roan This is a hammer-blow to the sports sector. The major professional governing bodies will be relieved that, unlike in the spring during the first national lockdown, action can at least continue behind closed doors, but hopes of a quick return of spectators eight months after turnstiles closed have suffered a major setback. The closure of gyms, pools and indoor sports facilities just a few months after they introduced strict hygiene and safety protocols enabling them to re-open, despite data showing comparatively low risk of transmission, will reinforce demands for a Â£1.5bn recovery fund for the sports sector, similar to the bail-out given to the culture and arts industry earlier this year. The fear is that these latest restrictions could lead to thousands of job losses, cause many facilities to close, and adversely affect physical and mental health, just when it is needed most to help the country get through this crisis.

"This video can not be played Sir Sean Connery's career spanned decades Sir Sean Connery has died at the age of 90, his family has said. The Scottish actor was best known for his portrayal of James Bond, being the first to bring the role to the big screen and appearing in seven of the spy thrillers. Sir Sean died peacefully in his sleep in the Bahamas, having been ""unwell for some time"", his son said. His acting career spanned seven decades and he won an Oscar in 1988 for his role in The Untouchables. Sir Sean's other films included The Hunt for Red October, Highlander, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade and The Rock. Obituary: Sir Sean Connery Sir Sean Connery's career in pictures Jason Connery said his father ""had many of his family, who could be in the Bahamas, around him"" when he died overnight in Nassau. Much of the Bond film Thunderball had been filmed there. He said: ""We are all working at understanding this huge event as it only happened so recently, even though my dad has been unwell for some time. ""A sad day for all who knew and loved my dad and a sad loss for all people around the world who enjoyed the wonderful gift he had as an actor."" His publicist Nancy Seltzer said: ""There will be a private ceremony followed by a memorial yet to be planned once the virus has ended."" He leaves his wife Micheline and sons Jason and Stephane. Daniel Craig said Sir Sean defined an era Daniel Craig, the current James Bond, said Sir Sean was ""one of the true greats of cinema"". ""Sir Sean Connery will be remembered as Bond and so much more,"" he said. ""He defined an era and a style. The wit and charm he portrayed on screen could be measured in megawatts; he helped create the modern blockbuster. ""He will continue to influence actors and film-makers alike for years to come. My thoughts are with his family and loved ones."" In reference to Sir Sean's love of golf, he added: ""Wherever he is, I hope there is a golf course."" Dame Shirley Bassey, who sang the themes to three Bond films including Goldfinger, paid tribute saying: ""I'm incredibly saddened to hear of Sean's passing. ""My thoughts are with his family. He was a wonderful person, a true gentleman and we will be forever connected by Bond."" His Oscar win came in 1988 Sir Sean, from Fountainbridge in Edinburgh, had his first major film appearance in 1957 British gangster film No Road Back. He first played James Bond in Dr No in 1962 and went on to appear in five other official films - and the unofficial Never Say Never Again in 1983. He was largely regarded as being the best actor to have played 007 in the long-running franchise, often being named as such in polls. Connery made the character of James Bond his own, blending ruthlessness with sardonic wit. Many critics didn't like it and some of the reviews were scathing. But the public did not agree. The action scenes, sex and exotic locations were a winning formula. In truth, his Bond is now a museum piece; the portrayal of women impossibly dated. The action scenes are still thrilling, but the sex too often bordered on the non-consensual. Thankfully, its been a while since 007 slapped a woman on the backside and forced a kiss. But Connery's performance was of its time, enjoyed by millions of both sexes and gave the silver screen a 20th Century icon. Read more about the life of the Scotsman who became a global star He was knighted by the Queen at Holyrood Palace in 2000. In August, he celebrated his 90th birthday. Bond producers Michael G Wilson and Barbara Broccoli said they were ""devastated by the news"" of his death. They said: ""He was and shall always be remembered as the original James Bond whose indelible entrance into cinema history began when he announced those unforgettable words 'the name's Bond... James Bond'. ""He revolutionised the world with his gritty and witty portrayal of the sexy and charismatic secret agent. He is undoubtedly largely responsible for the success of the film series and we shall be forever grateful to him."" Star Wars director George Lucas, who also created the Indiana Jones character, said Sir Sean ""left an indelible mark in cinematic history"". ""He will always hold a special place in my heart as Indy's dad. With an air of intelligent authority and sly sense of comedic mischief, only someone like Sean Connery could render Indiana Jones immediately into boyish regret or relief through a stern fatherly chiding or rejoiceful hug. ""I'm thankful for having had the good fortune to have known and worked with him. My thoughts are with his family."" Dr No (1962) From Russia with Love (1963) Goldfinger (1964) Thunderball (1965) You Only Live Twice (1967) Diamonds are Forever (1971) Never Say Never Again (1983) Sir Sean was a long-time supporter of Scottish independence, saying in interviews in the run-up to the 2014 referendum that he might return from his Bahamas home to live in Scotland if it voted to break away from the rest of the UK. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: ""I was heartbroken to learn this morning of the passing of Sir Sean Connery. Our nation today mourns one of her best loved sons. Scottish tributes to 'global legend' Sir Sean Connery ""Sean was born into a working class Edinburgh family and through talent and sheer hard work, became an international film icon and one of the world's most accomplished actors. Sean will be remembered best as James Bond - the classic 007 - but his roles were many and varied. ""He was a global legend but, first and foremost, a patriotic and proud Scot - his towering presence at the opening of the Scottish Parliament in 1999 showed his love for the country of his birth. Sean was a lifelong advocate of an independent Scotland and those of us who share that belief owe him a great debt of gratitude."" The actor and his wife Micheline Roquebrune attended the opening of the first Scottish Parliament in 1999 Alex Salmond, former first minister of Scotland, who was close friends with Sir Sean, described him as ""the world's greatest Scot, the last of the real Hollywood stars, the definitive Bond"". He said: ""Sean Connery was all of these things but much more. He was also a staunch patriot, a deep thinker and outstanding human being.""

"For many, Sean Connery was the definitive James Bond. Suave and cold-hearted, his 007 was every inch the Cold War dinosaur of the books. He strode across screen, licensed to kill. He moved like a panther, hungry and in search of prey. There was no contest. His great rival, Roger Moore, by contrast, simply cocked an eyebrow, smiled and did a quip. But whereas Ian Fleming's hero went to Eton, Connery's own background was noticeably short of fast cars, beautiful women and vodka Martinis - either shaken or stirred. Thomas Sean Connery was born in the Fountainbridge area of Edinburgh on 25 August 1930, the son of a Catholic factory worker and a Protestant domestic cleaner. His father's family had emigrated from Ireland in the 19th Century; his mother traced her line back to Gaelic speakers from the Isle of Skye. The area had been in decline for years. Young Tommy Connery was brought up in one room of a tenement with a shared toilet and no hot water. He left school at 13 with no qualifications and delivered milk, polished coffins and laid bricks, before joining the Royal Navy. Three years later, he was invalided out of the service with stomach ulcers. His arms by now had tattoos which proclaimed his passions: ""Scotland forever"" and ""Mum & Dad"". In Edinburgh, he gained a reputation as ""hard man"" when six gang members tried to steal from his coat.  When he stopped them, he was followed. Connery launched a one-man assault which the future Bond won hands down. He scraped a living any way he could. He drove trucks, worked as a lifeguard and posed as a model at the Edinburgh College of Art. He spent his spare time bodybuilding. Sean Connery left school without qualifications and worked as a milkman, brick layer and coffin polisher The artist Richard Demarco, who as a student often painted Connery, described him as ""too beautiful for words, a virtual Adonis"". A keen footballer, Connery was good enough to attract the attention of Matt Busby, who offered him a Â£25-a-week contract at Manchester United. But, bitten by the acting bug when odd-jobbing at a local theatre, he decided a footballer's career was potentially too short and opted to pursue his luck on the stage. It was, he later said, ""one of my more intelligent moves"". In 1953, he was in London competing in the Mr Universe competition. He heard that there were parts going in the chorus of a production of the musical South Pacific. By the following year, he was playing the role of Lieutenant Buzz Adams, made famous on Broadway by Larry Hagman. American actor Robert Henderson encouraged Connery to educate himself. Henderson lent him works by Ibsen, Shakespeare and Bernard Shaw, and persuaded Connery to take elocution lessons. Connery made the first of many appearances as a film extra in the 1954 movie Lilacs in the Spring.  There were minor roles on television too, including a gangster in an episode of the BBC police drama Dixon of Dock Green. In 1957, he got his first leading role in Blood Money, a BBC reworking of Requiem for a Heavyweight, in which he portrayed a boxer whose career is in decline. It had been made famous in America by Hollywood legend Jack Palance. When Palance refused to travel to London, the director's wife suggested Sean. ""The ladies will like him,"" she said. A year later, he was alongside Lana Turner - proper Tinsel Town royalty - in the film Another Time, Another Place. Her boyfriend, the mobster Johnny Stompanato, reacted badly to rumours of a romance. He stormed on set and pulled out a gun. Connery grabbed it from his hand and overpowered him, before others stepped in and kicked him off set. He was praised for his role in the BBC drama, Blood Money And then came Bond. Producers Cubby Broccoli and Harry Saltzman had acquired the rights to film Ian Fleming's novels and were looking for an actor to portray 007. Richard Burton, Cary Grant and Rex Harrison were all considered, even Lord Lucan and the BBC's Peter Snow. It was Broccoli's wife, Dana, who persuaded her husband that Connery had the magnetism and sexual chemistry for the part. That view was not originally shared by Bond's creator, Ian Fleming. ""I'm looking for Commander Bond and not an overgrown stuntman,"" he insisted. But Broccoli was right, and Fleming was wrong. The author quickly changed his mind when he saw him on screen. He even wrote a half-Scottish history for the character in some of his later works. James Bond actor Sir Sean Connery dies aged 90 In pictures: Sir Sean Connery A director friend, Terence Young, took Connery under his wing, taking him to expensive restaurants and casinos; teaching him how to carry himself, so the slightly gauche Scot would pass as a suave and sophisticated secret agent. Connery made the character his own, blending ruthlessness with sardonic wit. Many critics didn't like it and some of the reviews were scathing. But the public did not agree. The action scenes, sex and exotic locations were a winning formula. The first film, Dr No, made a pile of money at the box office. Even abroad it was hugely successful; with President Kennedy requesting a private screening at the White House. More outings swiftly followed - From Russia with Love (1963), Goldfinger (1964), Thunderball (1965) and You Only Live Twice (1967). It was exhausting and occasionally dangerous.  At one point, he was thrown into a pool full of sharks with only a flexi-glass screen for protection.  When one of the creatures got through, Connery beat the hastiest of retreats. There was other work, including Alfred Hitchcock's Marnie, and The Hill, a drama about a wartime British Army prison in North Africa. By the time of Goldfinger he was beginning to resent the publicity the role brought But by the time You Only Live Twice was completed, Connery was tiring of Bond and feared being typecast. He turned down On Her Majesty's Secret Service, with the role given to Australian actor George Lazenby, whose career never recovered. Saltzman and Broccoli lured Connery back for Diamonds Are Forever in 1971, meeting the actor's demand for a then record $1.25m fee. Connery used it to set up the Scottish International Education Trust, supporting the careers of up-and-coming Scottish artists. The film had mixed reviews, with some critics complaining the film relied too much on camp humour, a theme that would continue and develop under his successor, Roger Moore. Connery starred in the Rudyard Kipling tale The Man Who Would Be King alongside his great friend Michael Caine, but most of the next decade was spent in supporting roles, such as in Time Bandits, or as part of an ensemble cast in films like A Bridge Too Far. Having lost a lot of money in a Spanish land deal, he accepted a lucrative offer to play Bond again, in Never Say Never Again. This time 007 was an ageing hero; older, wiser and self-deprecating but ultimately still as hard as nails. The title was suggested by Connery's wife, who reminded her husband he had vowed ""never to play Bond again"". He continued to play other parts, winning a Bafta for his performance as William of Baskerville in Umberto Eco's The Name of the Rose. Films like The Name of the Rose helped him escape the mantle of Bond A year later, his performance as a world-weary Irish beat cop, albeit with a definite Scottish accent, in The Untouchables, won him an Oscar for best supporting actor. In Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, he played Harrison Ford's father, despite being only 12 years older. And there was a knowing nod towards James Bond alongside Nicolas Cage in The Rock, where he was a British secret agent kept imprisoned for decades. There was box office success for The Hunt for Red October, The Russia House and Entrapment; although First Knight and The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen failed to take off. And he turned down the role of Gandalf in The Lord of the Rings in 2006, declaring himself tired of acting and sick of the ""idiots now making films in Hollywood"". He was briefly considered for the role of the gamekeeper in the 2012 Bond film Skyfall, but the director, Sam Mendes, wisely felt it would be distracting to have a previous 007 appear with Daniel Craig. Always hating the Hollywood lifestyle, he preferred to play golf at his homes in Spain, Portugal and the Caribbean with his second wife, Micheline Roqubrune, an artist he had met in Morocco. His previous marriage, to the Australian actress Diane Cilento, had ended in 1975 amid allegations he had been violent towards her and had a string of affairs. They had one son, the actor Jason Connery. He claimed he remained true to his Scottish roots despite living abroad Despite his exile, he retained a full throated passion for Scotland, despite once misguidedly endorsing a Japanese blend of whisky. He attributed his short fuse and his ""moodiness"" to his Celtic genes. ""My view is that to get anywhere in life you have to be anti-social,'' he once said. ""Otherwise you'll end up being devoured."" A long overdue knighthood, finally awarded in 2000, was reportedly held up by the Labour government because of his support for Scottish independence. In truth, his Bond is now a museum piece; the portrayal of women impossibly dated. The action scenes are still thrilling, but the sex too often bordered on the non-consensual. Thankfully, it's been a while since 007 slapped a woman on the backside and forced a kiss. But Connery's performance was of its time, enjoyed by millions of both sexes and gave the silver screen a 20th Century icon. He leaves behind him a body of work that any actor would be proud of and, not least, a vacancy for the title ""Greatest Living Scot"".

"This video can not be played Prime Minister Boris Johnson: ""Now is the time to take action"" The Premier League and other elite sport can continue behind closed doors during anew four-week national lockdownin England. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has announced new restrictions for the country that will start on Thursday and run until 2 December to combat coronavirus and avoid the NHS being overwhelmed. Culture secretary Oliver Dowdentweeted that,external""travel to a place of work will be permitted"" for ""elite sport played behind closed doors"". During a news conference to announce the measures, Johnson gave a thumbs up and said ""Yes to the Premier League"" when asked if top-flight football will continue. The Premier League was halted in March before the first national lockdown and has been played without fans since it restarted in June. Players are tested weekly for the virus. The English Football League says it has been told by the government that its competitions can continue in England and Wales. ""We acknowledge the government's national efforts in tackling this outbreak and would hope that during this next phase of the crisis, our national sport, negatively affected by Covid-19 like many other industries, can continue to provide some form of welcome distraction and give people in our communities up and down the country a sense of normality in very challenging times,"" the EFL said in a statement. It is not clear how grassroots and amateur sport will be affected, but guidance is being drawn up. However sources have indicated to BBC Sport that is unlikely that grassroots team sport will be permitted to continue. Nine of the 40FA Cup first round tiesdue to be played over 6-9 November involve teams from ""non-elite"" leagues. The Football Association says it is ""awaiting further information before we can confirm how this may affect non-elite football across England"". Under the new restrictions: People are being told to stay at home unless they have a specific reason to leave, such as work which cannot be done from home and education. People are allowed to exercise outdoors alone, with their household or with one other person. The government has confirmed leisure centres and gyms will close, as will other indoor and outdoor leisure facilities including: sports facilities including swimming pools, golf courses and driving ranges, bowling alleys, dance studios, stables and riding centres, climbing walls and climbing centres, archery and shooting ranges. Read full restrictions here,external The Lawn Tennis Association says that, while indoor tennis will be halted, it will ""make a case"" to the government for outdoor tennis between two individuals from different households to be allowed in line with restrictions on exercise, adding that tennis is a ""socially distanced sport with the net acting as a natural barrier"". The Sport and Recreation Alliance, which represents UK national sports organisations including the Football Association and Rugby Football Union along with community sport, has called for ""urgent support"" from the government. Chief executive Lisa Wainwright said: ""These restrictions will critically affect the 150,000 plus local sports clubs in every community across England and will place them in a perilous scenario not knowing if they will ever open their doors again"" adding it could be the ""final nail in the coffin for grassroots clubs which have struggled to survive the initial lockdown"". Swim England chief executive Jane Nickerson said her organisation thought it was ""extremely disappointing and frustrating to see indoor leisure being forced to close again,"" adding that pools were a ""safe and a lifeline for many people"" and should be ""considered an essential service"". ""A second period of closure will push many facilities over the edge and there is the dangerous prospect of losing so many facilities for good,"" she said. Nickerson urged the government to ""dig deep and find the necessary funding to ensure we don't see swimming pools and other leisure facilities permanently close"". UK Active, a non-for-profit body representing gyms and leisure centres said it was ""deeply concerned"" by the new measures. In a statement, it said: ""We urge the Prime Minister to ensure comprehensive financial support for the health and fitness sector is available to help it survive this period, minimising the now grave threat to further business failure and significant job losses."" Speaking after his side's 2-1 win over West Ham, Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp said: ""It is obviously what we wanted (football to continue) and I think we proved we can keep the bubble safe. ""Everyone had cases, that is the time we are in, but we could isolate these cases pretty quickly to prevent spread. ""I think it never happened at a training ground but it has happened when travelling, with international teams, normal life. I think we proved we can do it. ""And in a lockdown it is really important for the people that they can do things they like to do, and watching football is obviously something they like to do. I am happy we can continue."" BBC Sports editor Dan Roan This is a hammer-blow to the sports sector. The major professional governing bodies will be relieved that, unlike in the spring during the first national lockdown, action can at least continue behind closed doors, but hopes of a quick return of spectators eight months after turnstiles closed have suffered a major setback. The closure of gyms, pools and indoor sports facilities just a few months after they introduced strict hygiene and safety protocols enabling them to re-open, despite data showing comparatively low risk of transmission, will reinforce demands for a Â£1.5bn recovery fund for the sports sector, similar to the bail-out given to the culture and arts industry earlier this year. The fear is that these latest restrictions could lead to thousands of job losses, cause many facilities to close, and adversely affect physical and mental health, just when it is needed most to help the country get through this crisis.

"This video can not be played Sir Sean Connery's career spanned decades Sir Sean Connery has died at the age of 90, his family has said. The Scottish actor was best known for his portrayal of James Bond, being the first to bring the role to the big screen and appearing in seven of the spy thrillers. Sir Sean died peacefully in his sleep in the Bahamas, having been ""unwell for some time"", his son said. His acting career spanned seven decades and he won an Oscar in 1988 for his role in The Untouchables. Sir Sean's other films included The Hunt for Red October, Highlander, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade and The Rock. Obituary: Sir Sean Connery Sir Sean Connery's career in pictures Jason Connery said his father ""had many of his family, who could be in the Bahamas, around him"" when he died overnight in Nassau. Much of the Bond film Thunderball had been filmed there. He said: ""We are all working at understanding this huge event as it only happened so recently, even though my dad has been unwell for some time. ""A sad day for all who knew and loved my dad and a sad loss for all people around the world who enjoyed the wonderful gift he had as an actor."" His publicist Nancy Seltzer said: ""There will be a private ceremony followed by a memorial yet to be planned once the virus has ended."" He leaves his wife Micheline and sons Jason and Stephane. Daniel Craig said Sir Sean defined an era Daniel Craig, the current James Bond, said Sir Sean was ""one of the true greats of cinema"". ""Sir Sean Connery will be remembered as Bond and so much more,"" he said. ""He defined an era and a style. The wit and charm he portrayed on screen could be measured in megawatts; he helped create the modern blockbuster. ""He will continue to influence actors and film-makers alike for years to come. My thoughts are with his family and loved ones."" In reference to Sir Sean's love of golf, he added: ""Wherever he is, I hope there is a golf course."" Dame Shirley Bassey, who sang the themes to three Bond films including Goldfinger, paid tribute saying: ""I'm incredibly saddened to hear of Sean's passing. ""My thoughts are with his family. He was a wonderful person, a true gentleman and we will be forever connected by Bond."" His Oscar win came in 1988 Sir Sean, from Fountainbridge in Edinburgh, had his first major film appearance in 1957 British gangster film No Road Back. He first played James Bond in Dr No in 1962 and went on to appear in five other official films - and the unofficial Never Say Never Again in 1983. He was largely regarded as being the best actor to have played 007 in the long-running franchise, often being named as such in polls. Connery made the character of James Bond his own, blending ruthlessness with sardonic wit. Many critics didn't like it and some of the reviews were scathing. But the public did not agree.

They said: ""He was and shall always be remembered as the original James Bond whose indelible entrance into cinema history began when he announced those unforgettable words 'the name's Bond... James Bond'. ""He revolutionised the world with his gritty and witty portrayal of the sexy and charismatic secret agent.

Star Wars director George Lucas, who also created the Indiana Jones character, said Sir Sean ""left an indelible mark in cinematic history"". ""He will always hold a special place in my heart as Indy's dad.

Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: ""I was heartbroken to learn this morning of the passing of Sir Sean Connery. Our nation today mourns one of her best loved sons. Scottish tributes to 'global legend' Sir Sean Connery ""Sean was born into a working class Edinburgh family and through talent and sheer hard work, became an international film icon and one of the world's most accomplished actors. Sean will be remembered best as James Bond - the classic 007 - but his roles were many and varied. ""He was a global legend but, first and foremost, a patriotic and proud Scot - his towering presence at the opening of the Scottish Parliament in 1999 showed his love for the country of his birth. Sean was a lifelong advocate of an independent Scotland and those of us who share that belief owe him a great debt of gratitude."" The actor and his wife Micheline Roquebrune attended the opening of the first Scottish Parliament in 1999 Alex Salmond, former first minister of Scotland, who was close friends with Sir Sean, described him as ""the world's greatest Scot, the last of the real Hollywood stars, the definitive Bond"".

"Boris Johnson announces a new four-week lockdown across England, starting from Thursday Bars and restaurants will close, but takeaways can continue to operate - as in the spring lockdown Shielding measures will not be reintroduced, but vulnerable people or those aged over 70 are told to be especially careful Schools and universities will be kept open throughout this period, unlike in the lockdown earlier this year The furlough system paying 80% of employee wages will be extended through November The current surge in the virus has seen the UK's total number of positive cases pass the one million mark - it now stands at 1,011,660 One model, seen by the government, forecasts up to 4,000 deaths a day during the winter months no action is taken Over the past seven days, the UK has averaged almost 23,000 new cases a day, and 237 deaths with coronavirus Edited by John Hand We're ending our live coverage of the prime minster's briefing shortly, so thank you for joining us. Today's live page was brought to you by John Hand, Jo Couzens, Hazel Shearing and Sophie Williams. Reality Check Hours before it was due to end, the furlough scheme has been
extended. About 10 million jobs have already been subsidised by the scheme
- which pays up to 80% of the wages of people who canât work due to coronavirus. It was about to be replaced by the Job Support Scheme (JSS), which
offered varying levels of support depending on whether businesses could still
stay open. The government faced a stand-off with Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham over
the introduction of tier three âvery highâ coronavirus measures in the city, rejecting
his demands for a return to the 80% furlough payment. Just weeks later, the scheme has been extended across the
whole of the country. In recent months, employers have had to pay toward the
scheme but will now only pay pension and national insurance contributions. Reality Check Prime Minister Boris Johnson was asked at the briefing whether England faced a âlonger lockdownâ now because he hadnât followed scientific advice five weeks ago. So, what was that advice? The Scientific Advisory Group on Emergencies (Sage) said on 21 September that, because cases were increasing across the country in all age groups,a ""circuit breaker"" - a short period of national lockdown - should be considered for ""immediate introduction"".,external Boris Johnson decided not to follow this advice at the time - Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer supported the circuit breaker plan when the Sage advice was published in October. Instead, the prime minister backedthe introduction of a tier system for England- with different levels of restrictions for areas with different levels of coronavirus infection. Mr Johnson is now arguing that, confronted with data showing a surge in coronavirus cases and predictions that the NHS could be put under significant pressure, âitâs right that the government should change its approachâ. He also said the government was paying attention to other scientific advice as well: ""We've had to listen to all kinds of scientific advice, some of which tends in very much a different direction than some of the Sage advice that you've seen. ""But we also have to balance that scientific advice with the consequences for people's lives and people's mental health and people's livelihoods that comes from lockdown measures."" The first lockdown was announced on 23 March The first lockdown in
England was announced on 23 March, when Boris Johnson addressed the
nation in a special broadcast, outlining the new restrictions aimed at curbing
the spread of the virus. Under the measures, people
were only allowed to leave home to exercise once a day, travel to and from work
when âabsolutely necessaryâ, shop for essential items and fulfil any
medical or care needs. Schools were closed and shops selling
non-essential goods were shut along with gyms and public gatherings were banned. Easing of the measures happened in stages. On 1 June, children began returning to school. Two
weeks, later non-essential shops were allowed to reopen along with zoos and
safari parks. Pubs opened their doors again on 4 July followed by beauty salons, nail bars and tattoo shops. On August 15, small
wedding receptions were allowed and bowling alleys and casinos reopened. But a few weeks later, the prime minister warned of a second wave of the virus. Unlike last time, schools will stay open. The new raft of measures will come in from Thursday, but not everything will be the same as the first lockdown. For example: It's worth noting that there are different ways to measure the total UK's death toll. The government's coronavirus dashboard counts deaths that occurred within 28 days of a positive test result, but other measurements give a higher total figure. Here is some of the latest government data on the pandemic in the UK, showing that daily confirmed cases and deaths are continuing to rise. The measures announced by Boris Johnson today are for England. Walesremains under a 17-day ""firebreak"" lockdown until 9 November in an effort to curb the spread of the virus. Scotlandhas introduced a new five-tiered system which is set to come into force on Monday. People have been advised not to travel to or from England except for essential purposes. Northern Irelandhas closed pubs and restaurants for four weeks, with the exception of takeaways and deliveries. Gyms will be among the venues that have to close During the news conference, it was explained that the number of hospital admissions is rising rapidly. Scientists have made a projection to see how the number of daily admissions would rise over the next six weeks. As shown by the graph below, the number would surpass the figures of the first wave. Graphs show that those in the older age categories are driving hospital admission rates. However the number of admissions are rising for categories over the age of 15. The number of people with Covid-19 in inpatient beds in England has also risen, as shown by the chart below. Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent Boris Johnson has been trying to avoid this for weeks. The
scientists called for a circuit-breaker weeks ago â Labour have been doing the
same for the last fortnight. The government is still defending the local lockdown
strategy but things have changed. The graphs we saw in the press conference
show a real risk the NHS could be overwhelmed if action isnât taken now. The
PMâs argument is that he is reacting to a virus that is now spreading far
quicker than feared. But some will look at the warnings of the last few weeks and
ask why this action wasnât taken sooner. Tiered measures are not having a big enough effect on virus
transmission, Professor Neil Ferguson from Imperial College has warned. He told the BBC News relaxed measures
meant the virus had resurged. âWhilst the tier two, tier three measures are having some effect,
it doesnât seem to be enough. If we want to get very high infection levels
down, we need to impose more measures particularly ahead of Christmas."" he said. He added there was always some question as to whether tier three measures were sufficient and insisted it had proved not to be the case. Mr Ferguson warned that infection levels will increase again, adding: ""The important question is what will follow this lockdown."" Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent This is one of the starkest updates weâve seen from the government for months. Although elements of the lockdown will look different this time, the PM has returned to the theme that dominated our lives earlier this year: âStay at homeâ. He is defending his
strategy so far â the local interventions designed to avoid this national
lockdown. He says the picture has been evolving. But there will be big political
questions for the government â remember, Labour have been calling for a circuit-breaker for weeks now. Mr Johnson thanked people for tuning in. He said: ""Just to repeat, the three rays of sunshine of optimism from our scientific medical adviser. ""The prospect of better drugs, realistic prospect of a vaccine and the hopes that we're placing in rapid turnaround testing that we're rolling out across the country. ""In the meantime we have to put in place these tougher measures. Don't forget the basics, hand, space, face, get a test."" Pallab GhoshScience correspondent, BBC News The government was advised to bring in a form of
lockdown in England by its scientific advisory group on 21 September. Instead,
it opted first for 22:00 GMT closing of pubs and restaurants. This was followed a
few weeks later by its tier system where the greatest restrictions would be
placed in the worst-hit areas. Purely from a public health point of view, bringing in a
lockdown when the experts advised it would have been the sensible thing to do.
It would have been shorter, brought cases down more quickly and given the test-and-trace
system a chance to catch up with the rise in cases. But minsters had to
consider the economic impact as well as the politics. They had hoped their
light-touch approach might have been enough to control the spread of the virus
while preserving jobs and businesses. Many scientists on the scientific
advisory group were deeply sceptical at the time that this would work. All of
them appreciate the difficult decisions ministers are faced with and none of
them take any satisfaction from having been proved right. Asked about the Premier League, the prime minister says football will continue. Giving a big thumbs up, Mr Johnson says: ""Yes to the Premier League"". Matches are currently taking place but with strict rules for players and no live audiences. Prof Whitty says those who were shielding - just over two million people - still need to take extra precautions. However, he explains that the government does not want to ""reproduce"" the shielding programme from the spring. ""There were both some practical problems and there was also the issue of people having significant problems with loneliness and feeling completely cut off from society,"" he says. He says the government wants to ""avoid those downsides"". Reality Check Unlike the March lockdown,
universities will not be required to close during this new period of tougher
restrictions. On 21 September, government
advisory group Sage recommended that all university teaching should be
moved online unless absolutely essential. The group has suggested closing
universities would have a âmoderate impactâ on transmission, as the high level
of close contact students have at university â through shared halls,
socialising and during lectures â makes outbreaks very likely. This has proved to be the case;
within weeks of students returning to university, about 40 universities had
reports of coronavirus, with thousands of students having to self-isolate. Many
universities have been switching tuition online. Prof Whitty says ""the idea that there is some perfect time to act is a complete misapprehension"". He says ""all the solutions are bad"" and the government is trying to go with ""the least bad set of solutions"". He adds: ""Let us see how this goes over the next few weeks."" The PM is asked whether he should have followed the scientific advice more closely and whether he has any regrets. He says: ""We have to balance that scientific advice with the consequences for people's lives, for people's mental health, people's livelihoods that comes from lockdown measures."" He stresses that schools are being kept open, and he wants to keep construction and manufacturing open. ""I'm not going to pretend to you that these judgements aren't incredibly difficult,"" he says. ""We have to change with the changing pattern of the virus. And, alas, what we're seeing now is a pretty consistent surge."" He adds: ""We have to deal with it."" Â© 2025 BBC.

"This video can not be played Prime Minister Boris Johnson: ""Now is the time to take action"" The Premier League and other elite sport can continue behind closed doors during anew four-week national lockdownin England. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has announced new restrictions for the country that will start on Thursday and run until 2 December to combat coronavirus and avoid the NHS being overwhelmed. Culture secretary Oliver Dowdentweeted that,external""travel to a place of work will be permitted"" for ""elite sport played behind closed doors"". During a news conference to announce the measures, Johnson gave a thumbs up and said ""Yes to the Premier League"" when asked if top-flight football will continue. The Premier League was halted in March before the first national lockdown and has been played without fans since it restarted in June. Players are tested weekly for the virus. The English Football League says it has been told by the government that its competitions can continue in England and Wales. ""We acknowledge the government's national efforts in tackling this outbreak and would hope that during this next phase of the crisis, our national sport, negatively affected by Covid-19 like many other industries, can continue to provide some form of welcome distraction and give people in our communities up and down the country a sense of normality in very challenging times,"" the EFL said in a statement. It is not clear how grassroots and amateur sport will be affected, but guidance is being drawn up. However sources have indicated to BBC Sport that is unlikely that grassroots team sport will be permitted to continue. Nine of the 40FA Cup first round tiesdue to be played over 6-9 November involve teams from ""non-elite"" leagues. The Football Association says it is ""awaiting further information before we can confirm how this may affect non-elite football across England"". Under the new restrictions: People are being told to stay at home unless they have a specific reason to leave, such as work which cannot be done from home and education. People are allowed to exercise outdoors alone, with their household or with one other person. The government has confirmed leisure centres and gyms will close, as will other indoor and outdoor leisure facilities including: sports facilities including swimming pools, golf courses and driving ranges, bowling alleys, dance studios, stables and riding centres, climbing walls and climbing centres, archery and shooting ranges. Read full restrictions here,external The Lawn Tennis Association says that, while indoor tennis will be halted, it will ""make a case"" to the government for outdoor tennis between two individuals from different households to be allowed in line with restrictions on exercise, adding that tennis is a ""socially distanced sport with the net acting as a natural barrier"". The Sport and Recreation Alliance, which represents UK national sports organisations including the Football Association and Rugby Football Union along with community sport, has called for ""urgent support"" from the government. Chief executive Lisa Wainwright said: ""These restrictions will critically affect the 150,000 plus local sports clubs in every community across England and will place them in a perilous scenario not knowing if they will ever open their doors again"" adding it could be the ""final nail in the coffin for grassroots clubs which have struggled to survive the initial lockdown"". Swim England chief executive Jane Nickerson said her organisation thought it was ""extremely disappointing and frustrating to see indoor leisure being forced to close again,"" adding that pools were a ""safe and a lifeline for many people"" and should be ""considered an essential service"". ""A second period of closure will push many facilities over the edge and there is the dangerous prospect of losing so many facilities for good,"" she said. Nickerson urged the government to ""dig deep and find the necessary funding to ensure we don't see swimming pools and other leisure facilities permanently close"". UK Active, a non-for-profit body representing gyms and leisure centres said it was ""deeply concerned"" by the new measures. In a statement, it said: ""We urge the Prime Minister to ensure comprehensive financial support for the health and fitness sector is available to help it survive this period, minimising the now grave threat to further business failure and significant job losses."" Speaking after his side's 2-1 win over West Ham, Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp said: ""It is obviously what we wanted (football to continue) and I think we proved we can keep the bubble safe. ""Everyone had cases, that is the time we are in, but we could isolate these cases pretty quickly to prevent spread. ""I think it never happened at a training ground but it has happened when travelling, with international teams, normal life. I think we proved we can do it. ""And in a lockdown it is really important for the people that they can do things they like to do, and watching football is obviously something they like to do. I am happy we can continue."" BBC Sports editor Dan Roan This is a hammer-blow to the sports sector. The major professional governing bodies will be relieved that, unlike in the spring during the first national lockdown, action can at least continue behind closed doors, but hopes of a quick return of spectators eight months after turnstiles closed have suffered a major setback. The closure of gyms, pools and indoor sports facilities just a few months after they introduced strict hygiene and safety protocols enabling them to re-open, despite data showing comparatively low risk of transmission, will reinforce demands for a Â£1.5bn recovery fund for the sports sector, similar to the bail-out given to the culture and arts industry earlier this year. The fear is that these latest restrictions could lead to thousands of job losses, cause many facilities to close, and adversely affect physical and mental health, just when it is needed most to help the country get through this crisis.

"Donald Trump, Joe Biden, and their running mates criss-cross the country wooing voters three days ahead of the 3 November election Barack Obama joins forces with Biden in Michigan Trump targets the crucial battleground state of Pennsylvania While Trump and Biden campaign in northern states, Mike Pence is in North Carolina and Kamala Harris is in Florida Some 90 million people have already voted ahead of election day on Tuesday The country is course for its highest electoral turnout rate in more than a century On Friday the US once again broke its daily coronavirus record with more than 94,000 new cases Edited by Boer Deng Stevie Wonder performed for Biden in Detroit  Thanks for following our live coverage of the 2020 US election campaign on this Halloween Saturday. Some highlights from this frantic day of campaigning three days before election day: Our team will be back in the morning to bring you the latest news and features. Biden will be speaking in Pennsylvania while Trump is due to attend events in five different states. Today's live updates were brought to you by Boer Deng, Max Matza, Patrick Jackson and Helier Cheung. Police have used pepper spray to break up an anti-racist march to a polling station in a small town in North Carolina, local media report. At least 12 people were arrested,external, including a journalist, in the town of Graham, Alamance County, the News & Observer reports. Police had escorted the 200 or so marchers, who included local Democratic politicians, from a church to the town's Court Square, where a rally was held to encourage people to turn out and vote. But at one point police began clearing the road, and pepper spray was fired, with several young children affected. It is unclear how many marchers were unable to cast their ballots at the polling station, where the last day of early voting was under way. Faith Cook, one of the few marchers to make it to the polling station, told the paper: âIâve never experienced anything like that. Nobody should have to."" A quirky new poll out from YouGov and the Daily Show comedy programme has asked American voters some unusual questions, and heard back some equally strange answers. For instance, more Americans think Biden can be trusted to carve a turkey dinner or help them with their taxes over Trump - who famously has refused to release his tax returns. They also think the Democrat would be better at helping you get over a romantic breakup or run a doggy daycare centre. Trump, Americans say, would be better at recording a rap song or mixing a cosmopolitan cocktail over Biden. But more Americans say they would turn to the thrice-married president for help setting up an online dating profile or solving a computer problem. Reality Check President Trump has criticised plans to expand postal voting in the election, claiming it leads to widespread fraud - but what evidence is there? The US is in uncharted territory during the coronavirus pandemic as a record number of Americans vote by post. Election authorities and the postal service have been put under immense strain processing the millions of extra ballots. This has led to claims the system is unsafe and susceptible to manipulation. Numerous national and state-level studies have shown that although there have been isolated cases, electoral fraud is very rare. There have been a few, well-publicised cases, such as in the 2018 North Carolina primary, which was re-run after a consultant for the Republican candidate tampered with voting papers. But the rate of voting fraud overall in the US is less than 0.0009%, according to a 2017 study by the Brennan Center for Justice. And Federal Election Commission head Ellen Weintraub has said: ""There's simply no basis for the conspiracy theory that voting by mail causes fraud."" Read the full analysis, and more on places where fraud has been claimed this year, here. Trump and Biden are each now holding events A frenzied day of campaigning for Donald Trump and Joe Biden continues now as the rivals hold simultaneous events in two different swing states. Trump is due to appear in Butler, Pennsylvania - the third of four events he has in the state today - after earlier turning up in Newtown, a suburb of Philadelphia, and Reading, a bit further west. There, he joked about his family's recent brush with coronavirus. Both the president and first lady caught the virus, and Trump spent several days in hospital before recovering. Of their diagnoses, he said: ""At least those rumours that we don't live together proved to be false"". Meanwhile, Biden is due to turn up in Detroit, Michigan for his second rally of the day with help from his former boss, Barack Obama. He is due to get an extra boost from another special guest: Stevie Wonder. For a bit of Halloween fun, outspoken singer Lizzo has revealed her risque but zeitgeist-y costume - and no it's not a Trump wig. The Biden campaigner posted an image where she donned black wigs and insect eyes and was photoshopped onto Vice-President Mike Pence's head. The outfit is a reference to the fly that sat on Pence's head for over a minute during the vice-presidential debate. The incident sparked memes aplenty and led Biden to pose for a photo with a fly-swatter. Some businesses near the White House have been boarded up Students at the George Washington University in the US capital have reportedly been advised to stock up on essential goods like food and prescription medicines ahead of election day. Warning students living on or near campus of""potential disruptions... during the election period"",external, it advised them to have supplies for at least one week, a WTOP Radio report says, quoting a spokesperson. According to the radio, the advice is to ""prepare for election season as they would for a hurricane or blizzard"". Election day itself is designated a holiday by the university. Businesses in the city have been boarding up doors and windows as a precaution against rioting after the election results are announced. Every 30 seconds, a Latino in the US turns 18 and becomes eligible to vote. If they turn out, young Latino voters could swing the outcome of the election. Little wonder that both the Trump and Biden campaigns are eager to court them. BBC spoke to five first-time Latino voters from around the country to find out what issues they care most about - and of course, which presidential candidate they will be voting for. This video can not be played US election: What Latino first-time voters want Vice-President Mike Pence has spoken at a rally at the airport in Elizabeth City, North Carolina. ""We need North Carolina to show America that this is Trump country,"" he told supporters in the swing state. The attack continued the Trump campaign's strategy - painting Biden as corrupted by foreign powers. Biden's campaign denies any wrongdoing and claims that it is actually the Trump family that is guilty of influence peddling. ""Joe Biden has been a cheerleader for communist China all along,"" Pence claimed. He also called for voters to boot out the Democratic governor whose Covid-19 restrictions spoilt Republican plans to host their party conference there during the pandemic. Ebun Ekunwe voted for Trump in 2016 and Biden in 2020. BBC has been speaking to voters around the US to get their perspectives on the 2020 election. Ebun Ekunwe, 72, is a retired doctor and an associate pastor at her local church in Carrollton, Texas. She voted for Donald Trump in 2016 but now believes âthe man who promised to drain the swamp has only succeeded in poisoning the waters.â âI voted my conscience,â she said. âHe has spent four years upending the first letter of the Constitution: instead of 'We the People' he has made it 'Me the People.' Iâm keeping my fingers crossed that, with people fully energised like never before, we can turn it back to 'We the People.'â She queued early to vote for Joe Biden at her neighbourhood polling station, the public library. She cast her vote for the Democrat ânot because of his policies, but because civility matters to me.â Ebun is a member of our voter panel.You'll be hearing more from our other panelists throughout the week. More on the theme of Halloween today: a viral TikTok video of two twin girls in Oklahoma is drawing in eyeballs, after their mother dressed them as presidential candidates for Halloween. Four-year-olds Haven and Koti were born right before the 2016 election, their mother told KFOR-TV. âThey know they were Joe Biden and Donald Trump and see them on TV talking all the time, so they know theyâre somebody. I donât think they understand quite yet who they are,â said mum Adrea Garza. Garza told Good Morning America some people had criticised her costume choice for her girls, saying they should have dressed up as princesses instead. Her response? ""There's nothing wrong with dressing as a princess. My girls do it all the time. But there's nothing wrong with dressing as the president of the United States either."" As we mentioned earlier, a photo of two girls dressed up as Kamala Harris and her sister also delighted many -including Harris's younger sister, Maya,external. Building a ""big, beautiful wall"" between the US and Mexico was the signature promise of President Donald Trump's 2016 election campaign. A concrete barrier, he said, would serve to stop what he described as a flow of illegal immigrants and drugs over the border. But what actually happened to the wall? How much of it has been built? And how effective has it been? The BBC's Lucy Rodgers and Dominic Bailey have put togethersome charts and graphics to help explain.  Melania Trump made her second solo appearance of the 2020 campaign today in Wisconsin. She delivered pre-prepared lines from beneath a chandelier inside a packed barn. ""Joe Biden says he could do a better job leading our great nation,"" she said. ""Apparently when you hide in a basement, you feel safe communicating your wishful thinking.â The attack line echoes her husband's claim that Biden's effort to avoid people, which Biden says is due to social distancing measures made necessary due to the virus, keeps him ""hiding in the basement"". In addition to ""sleepy Joe,"" Trump occasionally has called him ""hidin' Biden"".  Biden dismissed the joke earlier today by tweeted a photo of one of his drive-in rallies. Unlike at Trump rallies, guests mostly socially distance and wear masks at Biden events. The first lady will giving more remarks in Pennsylvania, the ""keystone state"", later today, where her husband is campaigning. It's that kind of election year in America... some businesses in cities have been boarding up their doors and windows as a precaution against possible violent protests after Tuesday's vote. As we mentioned earlier, one poll suggests that nearly 56% of US voters are worried the presidential election will lead to an increase in violence. Workers covered the windows at The Hay-Adams hotel in Washington DC Boards covering the door of one office near the White House bear the slogan ""Black Lives Matter"" In New York City, plywood protects windows on a Macy's department store Businesses in Chicago began boarding up weeks ago in anticipation of election unrest California Senator Kamala Harris, the Democratic vice-presidential pick, is in the Miami area today. Harris appeared at her first of three events of the day with rapper Fat Joe and celebrity chef Jose AndrÃ©s. She encouraged the audience to vote, and slammed Trump's handling of the coronavirus. Democrats fret that early voters may not be turning out in Florida in the numbers needed for Biden to win the crucially important state. Meanwhile, Vice-President Mike Pence is in North Carolina, another swing state, for two events today. There, Republicans are nervous. Ready to run... astronaut Mark Kelly, football coach Tommy Tuberville and trucker Kelly Loeffler ""An astronaut, a pastor and an American football coach walk into the US Senate"" sounds like the opening to a joke, but that is what could happen when winners of the 2020 general election take their seats in Congress. While attention has been hyper-focused on the battle for the White House, an equally important fight is underway for control of Washington. Here are a few of the candidates to keep an eye on:  Read more: The five Senate races to watch Tangier Island, a part of Virginia, is slowly disappearing due to erosion and rising water levels, but this US community of fishermen is putting its faith in a sea wall - and President Trump - to protect their homes, jobs and way of life.

This video can not be played US election: The sinking island voting for President Trump The first of two Biden Michigan rallies is wrapping up before the 2020 Democratic nominee heads to Detroit with his old boss, Barack Obama. In his first appearance stumping for his former vice-president, Obama compared Donald Trump's character to Biden's. ""It used to be that being a man meant taking care of other people... not looking for credit but trying to live right..."" Obama said. ""When you elect Joe, that's what you'll see reflected from the White House."" Taking the stage, Biden paid tribute to Obama, saying his eight years in the White House had been free from scandal. ""It's time for Donald Trump to pack his bags and go home,"" he said. ""We're done with the chaos."" BBC has been speaking to voters around the US to get their perspectives on the 2020 election. Keirsten Greggs, 44, is a talent recruiter from Fairfax, Virginia.We featured her on a panel of voters during the first presidential debate, when she still had hope Joe Biden would earn her vote. In the end, he didn't win her vote. Keirsten waited in a two-hour queue and cast a protest vote for Charlotta Bass - the first black woman to own and operate a newspaper. âThereâs a notion that black women are going to save America. But not me. Not this black woman.â âIf the governor of Maryland can write-in a vote for a dead person [Ronald Reagan], I can make a symbolic vote too.â Obama at the drive-in event in Flint Barack Obama has been warming up the Democratic faithful at a drive-in rally in Flint, Michigan, ahead of Joe Biden's appearance as the party's candidate in Tuesday's presidential election. ""You can choose change,"" Obama said to the beeping of horns. ""You can choose a better America."" He condemned President Donald Trump's handling of the coronavirus pandemic, saying his main concern seemed to be the size of the crowds at his rallies. ""What Joe will do is get this pandemic under control,"" Obama said. Obama served as president from 2009 to 2017, while Biden served as his vice-president.  Â© 2025 BBC.

"Businessman Luke Johnson says people are despairing and lockdowns are a ""blunt instrument"" which also have consequences Multiple business leaders have hit out at the looming prospect of a second national lockdown in England, saying the potential damage ""is immense"". Businessman Luke Johnson says the country cannot afford another lockdown. ""We [the UK] are over Â£2 trillion in debt now...and I think the government has neglected to account for the total loss of the lockdown,"" he says. The government maintains it has struck a balance between protecting jobs, the economy and saving lives. Mr Johnson adds: ""The damage to confidence, entrepreneurs, investors, the destruction of jobs, unemployment and the social and welfare costs are immense."" This week, the London Ambulance Service revealed that it is now attending an average of 37 suicides a day, or attempted suicides, up from 22 a day in 2019. ""I think that is a direct consequence of lockdown. People are losing their jobs, they are lonely, depressed, the mental health toll on the country is exponential,"" says Mr Johnson, who formerly ran Pizza Express, Patisserie Valerie and the Giraffe chain. ""I think it will be much worse this winter because people can't go out into the sunshine and treat it as an extended sabbatical. ""It's going to be much grimmer."" Stock markets sink amid alarm at Covid surge Covid: 1,700 employers planned redundancies in September Rishi Sunak to unveil new rescue deal for jobs and firms He says his main problem with the government's strategy is that there is no clear ""exit plan"" for the pandemic and coronavirus restrictions. ""Before we were told it was a few weeks, and there's a suspicion it could be a few months. If Christmas is cancelled, that's it for many businesses,"" warns Mr Johnson. Frances Bishop, 29, founded children's retail chain The Pud Store, based in South Yorkshire, five years ago. Entrepreneur Frances Bishop says she has never felt so alone as a business owner ""I feel like I'm in a dictatorship. I know they're saying they're reviewing the Tier 3 rules every 28 days, but there's been no communications from the council business groups on what they're basing these restrictions on,"" says Ms Bishop, who has three stores. ""It feels like you're being asked to operate a business, pay your taxes, pay your staff and try to keep your head above water, in a room that's on fire and clouded with smoke."" She says that a big problem is that stores are allowed to be open, but customers are not allowed to come, so footfall has ""fallen off a cliff"". The situation has had an impact on her mental health, and Ms Bishop says that she has never felt more alone as a business owner, at a time when her employees are looking to her for leadership and support. ""I'm watching my life's work be undone everyday and I'm throwing everything at it,"" she says. Charlie Mullins, boss of Pimlico Plumbers, says that the government ""needs to listen to businesses and people in the real world"". Pimlico Plumbers boss Charlie Mullins thinks the ""fear factor"" will do more damage to the economy than the pandemic He thinks another lockdown will ""finish many businesses off"", and is also concerned about the toll of coronavirus restrictions on people's wellbeing. ""They're basically going the wrong way about it. The virus is going to be here for a while, we've got to learn to work around it, we can't surrender to it,"" he tells the BBC. ""We need to protect the elderly and vulnerable, of course, but the rest of us need to get back to work."" His view strongly echoed that of Mr Johnson. Mr Mullins said his firm has attended over 200,000 house calls through the pandemic and not one employee or customer has caught the coronavirus. ""The last furlough scheme they did was too generous, it's created an atmosphere of, 'I want to work from home and stay at home',"" he says. ""Boris must stand firm and ignore the fear junkies who want to play Russian roulette with our economy."" Businesses have been telling the BBC since September that theyare worried about Christmas- traditionally the most important time of the year for the hospitality, retail and event industries. Hospitality firm boss Gary Forrest says closing venues at 10pm means people leave an environment that ensures their safety for one that doesn't ""People are trying to book Christmas parties, we don't know if we can accept them - it's tending towards being a total disaster. The hospitality industry cannot afford to have a poor December this year,"" says Gary Forrest, chief executive of the High Street Group, which owns a large chain of bars, restaurants and hotels across the north-east of England. Mr Forrest was particularly frustrated that pubs and restaurants such as his have invested in measures to protect their customers, but now the industry ""seems to be bearing the brunt of the government's restrictions"". ""They told us to bring in table service - and the cost of table service is huge, your salary costs go up exponentially - and all the technology changes, but then they still come along and say, 'now you still need to shut the bars at 10pm',"" he says. ""I'm worried about the 300 people we employ, who've got mortgages and rent to pay."" Mr Forrest wants to see a system where venues are certified by the local authorities and regularly checked to ensure compliance with safety rules. And he wants more support for firms and venues located in parts of the UK where restrictions are in place, but fall short of a full lockdown with mandatory closures. He says the support for businesses operating in this 'Tier 2' environment is not sufficient. But not all business leaders are against the government's coronavirus restrictions. Events firm owner Debbie Marks says we have to do what it takes to get through to the other side of the pandemic Debbie Marks is chief executive of Qube Events, one of the North's largest luxury event companies organising large scale weddings, corporate events, private parties and galas â and now Christmas decor specialists. ""We need the restrictions to be lifted on how many people can come to an event, because 15 people is really not viable for our industry - but we need to bring an end to the pandemic, so if having a lockdown is what we need, then that's what needs to be done."" Ms Marks says she already has an order book full of events starting from next March, and that the UK has to get through the pandemic to the other side so that the events industry can resume. However, she says that isn't possible without support from the government. ""I'm devastated about the support the government has not given our industry. We've been completely ignored, and we're a billion pound industry,"" she explains.

"England win Six Nations on points difference from France Eddie Jones' side beat Italy 34-5 earlier to record +44 points difference France finish on same points total but inferior points difference of +21 Ireland finish third - above Scotland on points difference Saj Chowdhury It all started on 1 February and finished on 31 October - there was nothing ghoulish about the action on the final day. Congratulations England - they and we go again on 6 February. Thanks for reading, listening and watching. That's very much right Maggie. We will have live text coverage of that match - a 17:00 GMT kick-off. More English success, surely? Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Jamie HeaslipFormer Ireland number eight on BBC Radio 5 Live Owen Farrell is a level headed guy, unbelievable pro, leads by example and empathetic as well. He is an all rounder. He has been around leaders his whole life, when he was born with his dad. He knows how to lead men, he has seen it, he's learned it, he's lived it. He is a really good bloke off the field and I think that is what the best leaders are. They are able to be good humans off the field and understand you as a person, not just a rugby player. And when you're on the field they lead by example and demand the highest standards. Ugo MonyeFormer England winger on BBC Radio 5 Live It is a magic day for England. Any day you win a Six Nations title is, of course, but it is made more special by the debutants they had and Jamie George and Ben Youngs. Ben has been incredible. We often try to select our national team based on club form and his form for Leicester hasn't always been great for the past couple of years. But whenever he has put on an England jersey he's been incredinle.to be only the second Englishman to reach that achievement is fantastic. England 34-5 Italy England didn't have it all that easy against Italy in the first half. The home side also seemed to be super pumped for the game. Obviously Eddie Jones' side turned it up a few notches after the break. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

What I am excited about seeing is how this team progress over the next four to six weeks. If today was just 'keep it simple, we haven't played a game in seven months' I can forgive that if we see a little bit more from them. Allow Twitter content?

Jamie HeaslipFormer Ireland number eight on BBC Radio 5 Live If England and France are playing now I think England might be the favourites. I think France are playing a better style of rugby but that is not the rugby which is rewarded right now, particularly in the Northern Hemisphere. That is why I think England are slightly the better side. Ugo MonyeFormer England winger on BBC Radio 5 Live I often think when you select certain players it is an indication of how you want to play. Anthony Watson came off after 60 minutes, I'd love to see his numbers, I reckon he carried twice. What's the point? You might as well select another back row player out on the wing to do that job if it is just a kick-chase job. Either way it is effective. France 35-27 Ireland Jacob Stockdale went over for a very late consolation for Ireland. He was guilty of some poor handling errors in Paris. France 35-27 Ireland Another silky smooth France move resulted in a try for Virimi Vakatawa of Racing 92. England win the Six Nations Martin JohnsonFormer England captain and coach on BBC One England are in a similar position to many ways, they've got an experienced team, they made a World Cup final but there's an opportunity for some younger guys to come through. We saw some come on today against Italy and there's other players that people are talking about and, as a coach, if you've got difficult selections in terms of you've got a lot of good players, that's a nice place to be. The other alternative is that you haven't got good players and you're trying to find someone to fill a slot. There is opportunity there for players to come through. Ben Youngs has played 100 games for England, he's been first choice scrum half for 10 years so we need the next guy, the next two guys to be coming through because we know you're only one incident away from losing that guy for six months so I think Eddie Jones will also take this opportunity to give guys a chance. FT: France 35-27 Ireland Ireland's Johnny Sexton on BBC One:""France took their opportunities really well, sometimes off nothing, sometimes off our mistakes. We weren't ruthless enough when we had the chance to score. we had a few chances five metres out and had a chance to go for the try, a brave decision to go for the try before half time, but we weren't accurate enough and it's going to be tough to look over for the next week or so."" On Cian Healy winning his 100th cap:""It's an amazing achievement by Cian and I wish we could have won the game and we saw the other results and knew we needed to win by six or by a bonus point so we tried to do. mixture and go for brave calls and get a try. we felt there was some space to exploit but we weren't good enough to take it."" On the Autumn Nations Cup: ""We're looking forward to a new competition, today is going to hurt but we've got some very important players coming back for us and some new players to come in so we're looking forward to getting back and trying to bounce back from this disappointment."" Ugo MonyeFormer England winger on BBC Radio 5 Live In terms of an evolution and getting ahead of the curve, what I would like to see more from England is perhaps a little bit more ambition. Eddie Jones was quick to talk about a privilege to put on the jersey and put a smile on people's faces. I wasn't smiling watching a ball being kicked, it was a game of kick tennis. It was effective - but it was against Italy. France 35-27 Ireland It was magic feet from Robbie Henshaw, who may just skip over the rest of the match when he gets home to watch his try. England win the Six Nations Martin JohnsonFormer England captain and coach on BBC One I think it's about right - these three teams definitely looked the best. France coming back and playing this rugby is brilliant for the tournament. Scotland beat Wales today and they won't care what the game looked like, people were saying it was ugly game but once you've not beat someone for some a long time it's just about winning and cracking on. I'm already looking forward to England v France next year. England will pick up the trophy tomorrow but they'll be thinking they've blown a Grand Slam because they played poorly in Paris in the first half and didn't really compete as we know. Ugo MonyeFormer England winger on BBC Radio 5 Live I don't just want to be seduced by the way they play but when you look at the composition of their team, France have almost everything. Gregory Aldritt won the player of the match again - I think that is his third of the tournament - he has been incredible. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Boris Johnson announces a new four-week lockdown across England, starting from Thursday Bars and restaurants will close, but takeaways can continue to operate - as in the spring lockdown Shielding measures will not be reintroduced, but vulnerable people or those aged over 70 are told to be especially careful Schools and universities will be kept open throughout this period, unlike in the lockdown earlier this year The furlough system paying 80% of employee wages will be extended through November The current surge in the virus has seen the UK's total number of positive cases pass the one million mark - it now stands at 1,011,660 One model, seen by the government, forecasts up to 4,000 deaths a day during the winter months no action is taken Over the past seven days, the UK has averaged almost 23,000 new cases a day, and 237 deaths with coronavirus Edited by John Hand We're ending our live coverage of the prime minster's briefing shortly, so thank you for joining us. Today's live page was brought to you by John Hand, Jo Couzens, Hazel Shearing and Sophie Williams. Reality Check Hours before it was due to end, the furlough scheme has been
extended. About 10 million jobs have already been subsidised by the scheme
- which pays up to 80% of the wages of people who canât work due to coronavirus. It was about to be replaced by the Job Support Scheme (JSS), which
offered varying levels of support depending on whether businesses could still
stay open. The government faced a stand-off with Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham over
the introduction of tier three âvery highâ coronavirus measures in the city, rejecting
his demands for a return to the 80% furlough payment. Just weeks later, the scheme has been extended across the
whole of the country. In recent months, employers have had to pay toward the
scheme but will now only pay pension and national insurance contributions. Reality Check Prime Minister Boris Johnson was asked at the briefing whether England faced a âlonger lockdownâ now because he hadnât followed scientific advice five weeks ago. So, what was that advice? The Scientific Advisory Group on Emergencies (Sage) said on 21 September that, because cases were increasing across the country in all age groups,a ""circuit breaker"" - a short period of national lockdown - should be considered for ""immediate introduction"".,external Boris Johnson decided not to follow this advice at the time - Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer supported the circuit breaker plan when the Sage advice was published in October. Instead, the prime minister backedthe introduction of a tier system for England- with different levels of restrictions for areas with different levels of coronavirus infection. Mr Johnson is now arguing that, confronted with data showing a surge in coronavirus cases and predictions that the NHS could be put under significant pressure, âitâs right that the government should change its approachâ. He also said the government was paying attention to other scientific advice as well: ""We've had to listen to all kinds of scientific advice, some of which tends in very much a different direction than some of the Sage advice that you've seen. ""But we also have to balance that scientific advice with the consequences for people's lives and people's mental health and people's livelihoods that comes from lockdown measures."" The first lockdown was announced on 23 March The first lockdown in
England was announced on 23 March, when Boris Johnson addressed the
nation in a special broadcast, outlining the new restrictions aimed at curbing
the spread of the virus. Under the measures, people
were only allowed to leave home to exercise once a day, travel to and from work
when âabsolutely necessaryâ, shop for essential items and fulfil any
medical or care needs. Schools were closed and shops selling
non-essential goods were shut along with gyms and public gatherings were banned. Easing of the measures happened in stages. On 1 June, children began returning to school. Two
weeks, later non-essential shops were allowed to reopen along with zoos and
safari parks. Pubs opened their doors again on 4 July followed by beauty salons, nail bars and tattoo shops. On August 15, small
wedding receptions were allowed and bowling alleys and casinos reopened. But a few weeks later, the prime minister warned of a second wave of the virus. Unlike last time, schools will stay open. The new raft of measures will come in from Thursday, but not everything will be the same as the first lockdown. For example: It's worth noting that there are different ways to measure the total UK's death toll. The government's coronavirus dashboard counts deaths that occurred within 28 days of a positive test result, but other measurements give a higher total figure. Here is some of the latest government data on the pandemic in the UK, showing that daily confirmed cases and deaths are continuing to rise. The measures announced by Boris Johnson today are for England. Walesremains under a 17-day ""firebreak"" lockdown until 9 November in an effort to curb the spread of the virus. Scotlandhas introduced a new five-tiered system which is set to come into force on Monday. People have been advised not to travel to or from England except for essential purposes. Northern Irelandhas closed pubs and restaurants for four weeks, with the exception of takeaways and deliveries. Gyms will be among the venues that have to close During the news conference, it was explained that the number of hospital admissions is rising rapidly. Scientists have made a projection to see how the number of daily admissions would rise over the next six weeks. As shown by the graph below, the number would surpass the figures of the first wave. Graphs show that those in the older age categories are driving hospital admission rates. However the number of admissions are rising for categories over the age of 15. The number of people with Covid-19 in inpatient beds in England has also risen, as shown by the chart below. Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent Boris Johnson has been trying to avoid this for weeks. The
scientists called for a circuit-breaker weeks ago â Labour have been doing the
same for the last fortnight. The government is still defending the local lockdown
strategy but things have changed. The graphs we saw in the press conference
show a real risk the NHS could be overwhelmed if action isnât taken now. The
PMâs argument is that he is reacting to a virus that is now spreading far
quicker than feared. But some will look at the warnings of the last few weeks and
ask why this action wasnât taken sooner. Tiered measures are not having a big enough effect on virus
transmission, Professor Neil Ferguson from Imperial College has warned. He told the BBC News relaxed measures
meant the virus had resurged. âWhilst the tier two, tier three measures are having some effect,
it doesnât seem to be enough. If we want to get very high infection levels
down, we need to impose more measures particularly ahead of Christmas."" he said. He added there was always some question as to whether tier three measures were sufficient and insisted it had proved not to be the case. Mr Ferguson warned that infection levels will increase again, adding: ""The important question is what will follow this lockdown."" Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent This is one of the starkest updates weâve seen from the government for months. Although elements of the lockdown will look different this time, the PM has returned to the theme that dominated our lives earlier this year: âStay at homeâ. He is defending his
strategy so far â the local interventions designed to avoid this national
lockdown. He says the picture has been evolving. But there will be big political
questions for the government â remember, Labour have been calling for a circuit-breaker for weeks now. Mr Johnson thanked people for tuning in. He said: ""Just to repeat, the three rays of sunshine of optimism from our scientific medical adviser. ""The prospect of better drugs, realistic prospect of a vaccine and the hopes that we're placing in rapid turnaround testing that we're rolling out across the country. ""In the meantime we have to put in place these tougher measures. Don't forget the basics, hand, space, face, get a test."" Pallab GhoshScience correspondent, BBC News The government was advised to bring in a form of
lockdown in England by its scientific advisory group on 21 September. Instead,
it opted first for 22:00 GMT closing of pubs and restaurants. This was followed a
few weeks later by its tier system where the greatest restrictions would be
placed in the worst-hit areas. Purely from a public health point of view, bringing in a
lockdown when the experts advised it would have been the sensible thing to do.
It would have been shorter, brought cases down more quickly and given the test-and-trace
system a chance to catch up with the rise in cases. But minsters had to
consider the economic impact as well as the politics. They had hoped their
light-touch approach might have been enough to control the spread of the virus
while preserving jobs and businesses. Many scientists on the scientific
advisory group were deeply sceptical at the time that this would work. All of
them appreciate the difficult decisions ministers are faced with and none of
them take any satisfaction from having been proved right. Asked about the Premier League, the prime minister says football will continue. Giving a big thumbs up, Mr Johnson says: ""Yes to the Premier League"". Matches are currently taking place but with strict rules for players and no live audiences. Prof Whitty says those who were shielding - just over two million people - still need to take extra precautions. However, he explains that the government does not want to ""reproduce"" the shielding programme from the spring. ""There were both some practical problems and there was also the issue of people having significant problems with loneliness and feeling completely cut off from society,"" he says. He says the government wants to ""avoid those downsides"". Reality Check Unlike the March lockdown,
universities will not be required to close during this new period of tougher
restrictions. On 21 September, government
advisory group Sage recommended that all university teaching should be
moved online unless absolutely essential. The group has suggested closing
universities would have a âmoderate impactâ on transmission, as the high level
of close contact students have at university â through shared halls,
socialising and during lectures â makes outbreaks very likely. This has proved to be the case;
within weeks of students returning to university, about 40 universities had
reports of coronavirus, with thousands of students having to self-isolate. Many
universities have been switching tuition online. Prof Whitty says ""the idea that there is some perfect time to act is a complete misapprehension"". He says ""all the solutions are bad"" and the government is trying to go with ""the least bad set of solutions"". He adds: ""Let us see how this goes over the next few weeks."" The PM is asked whether he should have followed the scientific advice more closely and whether he has any regrets. He says: ""We have to balance that scientific advice with the consequences for people's lives, for people's mental health, people's livelihoods that comes from lockdown measures."" He stresses that schools are being kept open, and he wants to keep construction and manufacturing open. ""I'm not going to pretend to you that these judgements aren't incredibly difficult,"" he says. ""We have to change with the changing pattern of the virus. And, alas, what we're seeing now is a pretty consistent surge."" He adds: ""We have to deal with it."" Â© 2025 BBC.

The Scientific Advisory Group on Emergencies (Sage) said on 21 September that, because cases were increasing across the country in all age groups,a ""circuit breaker"" - a short period of national lockdown - should be considered for ""immediate introduction"".,external Boris Johnson decided not to follow this advice at the time - Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer supported the circuit breaker plan when the Sage advice was published in October. Instead, the prime minister backedthe introduction of a tier system for England- with different levels of restrictions for areas with different levels of coronavirus infection. Mr Johnson is now arguing that, confronted with data showing a surge in coronavirus cases and predictions that the NHS could be put under significant pressure, âitâs right that the government should change its approachâ. He also said the government was paying attention to other scientific advice as well: ""We've had to listen to all kinds of scientific advice, some of which tends in very much a different direction than some of the Sage advice that you've seen. ""But we also have to balance that scientific advice with the consequences for people's lives and people's mental health and people's livelihoods that comes from lockdown measures."" The first lockdown was announced on 23 March The first lockdown in
England was announced on 23 March, when Boris Johnson addressed the
nation in a special broadcast, outlining the new restrictions aimed at curbing
the spread of the virus. Under the measures, people
were only allowed to leave home to exercise once a day, travel to and from work
when âabsolutely necessaryâ, shop for essential items and fulfil any
medical or care needs. Schools were closed and shops selling
non-essential goods were shut along with gyms and public gatherings were banned. Easing of the measures happened in stages. On 1 June, children began returning to school. Two
weeks, later non-essential shops were allowed to reopen along with zoos and
safari parks. Pubs opened their doors again on 4 July followed by beauty salons, nail bars and tattoo shops. On August 15, small
wedding receptions were allowed and bowling alleys and casinos reopened. But a few weeks later, the prime minister warned of a second wave of the virus. Unlike last time, schools will stay open. The new raft of measures will come in from Thursday, but not everything will be the same as the first lockdown. For example: It's worth noting that there are different ways to measure the total UK's death toll. The government's coronavirus dashboard counts deaths that occurred within 28 days of a positive test result, but other measurements give a higher total figure. Here is some of the latest government data on the pandemic in the UK, showing that daily confirmed cases and deaths are continuing to rise. The measures announced by Boris Johnson today are for England. Walesremains under a 17-day ""firebreak"" lockdown until 9 November in an effort to curb the spread of the virus. Scotlandhas introduced a new five-tiered system which is set to come into force on Monday. People have been advised not to travel to or from England except for essential purposes. Northern Irelandhas closed pubs and restaurants for four weeks, with the exception of takeaways and deliveries. Gyms will be among the venues that have to close During the news conference, it was explained that the number of hospital admissions is rising rapidly. Scientists have made a projection to see how the number of daily admissions would rise over the next six weeks. As shown by the graph below, the number would surpass the figures of the first wave. Graphs show that those in the older age categories are driving hospital admission rates. However the number of admissions are rising for categories over the age of 15. The number of people with Covid-19 in inpatient beds in England has also risen, as shown by the chart below. Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent Boris Johnson has been trying to avoid this for weeks. The
scientists called for a circuit-breaker weeks ago â Labour have been doing the
same for the last fortnight. The government is still defending the local lockdown
strategy but things have changed. The graphs we saw in the press conference
show a real risk the NHS could be overwhelmed if action isnât taken now. The
PMâs argument is that he is reacting to a virus that is now spreading far
quicker than feared. But some will look at the warnings of the last few weeks and
ask why this action wasnât taken sooner. Tiered measures are not having a big enough effect on virus
transmission, Professor Neil Ferguson from Imperial College has warned. He told the BBC News relaxed measures
meant the virus had resurged. âWhilst the tier two, tier three measures are having some effect,
it doesnât seem to be enough. If we want to get very high infection levels
down, we need to impose more measures particularly ahead of Christmas."" he said. He added there was always some question as to whether tier three measures were sufficient and insisted it had proved not to be the case. Mr Ferguson warned that infection levels will increase again, adding: ""The important question is what will follow this lockdown."" Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent This is one of the starkest updates weâve seen from the government for months. Although elements of the lockdown will look different this time, the PM has returned to the theme that dominated our lives earlier this year: âStay at homeâ. He is defending his
strategy so far â the local interventions designed to avoid this national
lockdown. He says the picture has been evolving. But there will be big political
questions for the government â remember, Labour have been calling for a circuit-breaker for weeks now. Mr Johnson thanked people for tuning in. He said: ""Just to repeat, the three rays of sunshine of optimism from our scientific medical adviser. ""The prospect of better drugs, realistic prospect of a vaccine and the hopes that we're placing in rapid turnaround testing that we're rolling out across the country. ""In the meantime we have to put in place these tougher measures. Don't forget the basics, hand, space, face, get a test."" Pallab GhoshScience correspondent, BBC News The government was advised to bring in a form of
lockdown in England by its scientific advisory group on 21 September. Instead,
it opted first for 22:00 GMT closing of pubs and restaurants. This was followed a
few weeks later by its tier system where the greatest restrictions would be
placed in the worst-hit areas. Purely from a public health point of view, bringing in a
lockdown when the experts advised it would have been the sensible thing to do.
It would have been shorter, brought cases down more quickly and given the test-and-trace
system a chance to catch up with the rise in cases. But minsters had to
consider the economic impact as well as the politics. They had hoped their
light-touch approach might have been enough to control the spread of the virus
while preserving jobs and businesses. Many scientists on the scientific
advisory group were deeply sceptical at the time that this would work. All of
them appreciate the difficult decisions ministers are faced with and none of
them take any satisfaction from having been proved right. Asked about the Premier League, the prime minister says football will continue. Giving a big thumbs up, Mr Johnson says: ""Yes to the Premier League"". Matches are currently taking place but with strict rules for players and no live audiences. Prof Whitty says those who were shielding - just over two million people - still need to take extra precautions. However, he explains that the government does not want to ""reproduce"" the shielding programme from the spring. ""There were both some practical problems and there was also the issue of people having significant problems with loneliness and feeling completely cut off from society,"" he says. He says the government wants to ""avoid those downsides"". Reality Check Unlike the March lockdown,
universities will not be required to close during this new period of tougher
restrictions. On 21 September, government
advisory group Sage recommended that all university teaching should be
moved online unless absolutely essential. The group has suggested closing
universities would have a âmoderate impactâ on transmission, as the high level
of close contact students have at university â through shared halls,
socialising and during lectures â makes outbreaks very likely. This has proved to be the case;
within weeks of students returning to university, about 40 universities had
reports of coronavirus, with thousands of students having to self-isolate. Many
universities have been switching tuition online. Prof Whitty says ""the idea that there is some perfect time to act is a complete misapprehension"". He says ""all the solutions are bad"" and the government is trying to go with ""the least bad set of solutions"". He adds: ""Let us see how this goes over the next few weeks."" The PM is asked whether he should have followed the scientific advice more closely and whether he has any regrets. He says: ""We have to balance that scientific advice with the consequences for people's lives, for people's mental health, people's livelihoods that comes from lockdown measures."" He stresses that schools are being kept open, and he wants to keep construction and manufacturing open. ""I'm not going to pretend to you that these judgements aren't incredibly difficult,"" he says. ""We have to change with the changing pattern of the virus. And, alas, what we're seeing now is a pretty consistent surge."" He adds: ""We have to deal with it."" Â© 2025 BBC.

"A Wales firebreak lockdown has been in force since 23 October A two-week firebreak in Wales will still end on 9 November, regardless of a lockdown in England, the Welsh Government has said. Prime Minister Boris Johnsonhas announced a second lockdown for Englandstarting on Thursday, lasting a month. He also said the furlough scheme due to end on Saturday will be extended and it will include Wales. But First Minister Mark Drakeford is unhappy it was not extended when they asked for it for the firebreak. ""Rishi Sunak said he wouldn't extend it in Wales when we asked,"" Mr Drakeford tweeted. ""It's now clear he could have said yes,"" he added. Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price called it ""one big con job"". Mr Drakeford said he would be talking to the UK government on Sunday ""to ensure Welsh businesses get full access"" to the support outlined. The Welsh Government's cabinet will also meet to discuss any potential border issues for Wales in light of the England lockdown. Earlier, he tweeted to say the all-Wales restrictions would end on 9 November and any announcement by Downing Street would ""relate to England"". Allow Twitter content?

The prime minister confirmed details of the lockdown that had been widely reported ahead of the announcement - with the exception of the furlough scheme which will be extended and return to the 80% level throughout it. Non-essential shops and hospitality will have to close for four weeks, until 2 December. But unlike the restrictions in spring, schools, colleges and universities in England will be allowed to stay open. After 2 December, the restrictions would be eased and regions would go back to the tiered system, he said. MPs still have to approve the plan and they will vote on it next week. Mr Johnson said: ""Christmas is going to be different this year, perhaps very different, but it's my sincere hope and belief that by taking tough action now we can allow families across the country to be together."" Plaid Cymru's Liz Saville Roberts said opposition leaders had been briefed on the decision by the UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock. But the MP for Dwyfor Meirionnydddescribed on Twitter,externalthe way reports of the details had been already leaked as ""desperate and disorganised"". Earlier, the Welsh Health Minister Vaughan Gething echoed the first minister, during a series of radio interviews on Saturday. On the firebreak, he told Times Radio: ""We are committed to that ending on Monday."" But he said the Welsh Government ""still want to know and understand how the rules in England will work"".

Caravan site owner Dylan Roberts says his business has been hit from both sides Farmer Dylan Roberts says the announcement in England will means his caravan park business near Mold in Flintshire will be squeezed again. He said it was a ""real shame"" the Welsh and UK governments had not worked together on the lockdown measures. ""They've done this staggered thing - nobody from England could come support my business or other businesses and now we're coming out, England's going in so they can't come in anyway,"" he said. ""It's a massive loss for me and for lots of other companies in the area."" He said his site was only 15 minute from the border - and the restrictions being imposed did not make sense to him. ""What difference does it make when people are travelling to work from Wales, every day and vice versa - why can't they come to my static caravans where they have their own kitchens, their own facilities and they're safer,"" he argued. People have been urged to stay at home and many shops and businesses have been closed in Wales' firebreak The Welsh Government's cabinet is set to meet at 13:00 on Sunday to discuss the outcome of the prime minister's latest announcement for England, and also to agree the rules in Wales when the firebreak ends. Welsh ministers have already saidthere will be no return to hyper-local lockdowns, which were in force in most of Wales before the two-week all-Wales measure was brought in. A set of ""national rules"" post-firebreak are expected to be agreed on Sunday Mr Drakeford told Friday's coronavirus briefing there would be a set of ""national rules"" across Wales. ""I hope that that will help people in Wales, just to be clearer about what they are being asked to do,"" he said. ""Because we have had evidence of people wanting to do the right thing, but not always being certain what the right thing is, because the rules have been more difficult to follow than we would have liked. ""We're going to simplify. We're going to clarify."" The Treasury has confirmed the extension of the furlough scheme until December will be UK-wide. That means even after Wales' firebreak ends on 9 November, businesses here will still be eligible for furlough. While more support is something opposition politicians have been calling for, the timing of this has not gone down well with the Welsh Government or opposition MPs - who are asking why the scheme has been extended when England went into lockdown, but was not when Wales announced its firebreak. The Welsh Government had previously asked the Treasury for further financial support as Wales entered the firebreak. The scheme's eligibility criteria has also changed. Now, any employees who were on an employer's PAYE payroll by the end of 30th October are eligible for the scheme. On 20 October First Minister Mark Drakeford wrote to Chancellor Rishi Sunak asking him to waive the requirement for workers to have already been furloughed for at least three weeks prior to 30 June, in order to be eligible for the scheme during the first week of Wales' firebreak. This requirement was not changed before the firebreak began last week. TEST AND TRACE:How does it work? THREE TIERS:How will the system work? SOCIAL DISTANCING:Can I give my friends a hug?

"Boris Johnson announces a new four-week lockdown across England, starting from Thursday Bars and restaurants will close, but takeaways can continue to operate - as in the spring lockdown Shielding measures will not be reintroduced, but vulnerable people or those aged over 70 are told to be especially careful Schools and universities will be kept open throughout this period, unlike in the lockdown earlier this year The furlough system paying 80% of employee wages will be extended through November The current surge in the virus has seen the UK's total number of positive cases pass the one million mark - it now stands at 1,011,660 One model, seen by the government, forecasts up to 4,000 deaths a day during the winter months no action is taken Over the past seven days, the UK has averaged almost 23,000 new cases a day, and 237 deaths with coronavirus Edited by John Hand We're ending our live coverage of the prime minster's briefing shortly, so thank you for joining us. Today's live page was brought to you by John Hand, Jo Couzens, Hazel Shearing and Sophie Williams. Reality Check Hours before it was due to end, the furlough scheme has been
extended. About 10 million jobs have already been subsidised by the scheme
- which pays up to 80% of the wages of people who canât work due to coronavirus. It was about to be replaced by the Job Support Scheme (JSS), which
offered varying levels of support depending on whether businesses could still
stay open. The government faced a stand-off with Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham over
the introduction of tier three âvery highâ coronavirus measures in the city, rejecting
his demands for a return to the 80% furlough payment. Just weeks later, the scheme has been extended across the
whole of the country. In recent months, employers have had to pay toward the
scheme but will now only pay pension and national insurance contributions. Reality Check Prime Minister Boris Johnson was asked at the briefing whether England faced a âlonger lockdownâ now because he hadnât followed scientific advice five weeks ago. So, what was that advice? The Scientific Advisory Group on Emergencies (Sage) said on 21 September that, because cases were increasing across the country in all age groups,a ""circuit breaker"" - a short period of national lockdown - should be considered for ""immediate introduction"".,external Boris Johnson decided not to follow this advice at the time - Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer supported the circuit breaker plan when the Sage advice was published in October. Instead, the prime minister backedthe introduction of a tier system for England- with different levels of restrictions for areas with different levels of coronavirus infection. Mr Johnson is now arguing that, confronted with data showing a surge in coronavirus cases and predictions that the NHS could be put under significant pressure, âitâs right that the government should change its approachâ. He also said the government was paying attention to other scientific advice as well: ""We've had to listen to all kinds of scientific advice, some of which tends in very much a different direction than some of the Sage advice that you've seen. ""But we also have to balance that scientific advice with the consequences for people's lives and people's mental health and people's livelihoods that comes from lockdown measures."" The first lockdown was announced on 23 March The first lockdown in
England was announced on 23 March, when Boris Johnson addressed the
nation in a special broadcast, outlining the new restrictions aimed at curbing
the spread of the virus. Under the measures, people
were only allowed to leave home to exercise once a day, travel to and from work
when âabsolutely necessaryâ, shop for essential items and fulfil any
medical or care needs. Schools were closed and shops selling
non-essential goods were shut along with gyms and public gatherings were banned. Easing of the measures happened in stages. On 1 June, children began returning to school. Two
weeks, later non-essential shops were allowed to reopen along with zoos and
safari parks. Pubs opened their doors again on 4 July followed by beauty salons, nail bars and tattoo shops. On August 15, small
wedding receptions were allowed and bowling alleys and casinos reopened. But a few weeks later, the prime minister warned of a second wave of the virus. Unlike last time, schools will stay open. The new raft of measures will come in from Thursday, but not everything will be the same as the first lockdown. For example: It's worth noting that there are different ways to measure the total UK's death toll. The government's coronavirus dashboard counts deaths that occurred within 28 days of a positive test result, but other measurements give a higher total figure. Here is some of the latest government data on the pandemic in the UK, showing that daily confirmed cases and deaths are continuing to rise. The measures announced by Boris Johnson today are for England. Walesremains under a 17-day ""firebreak"" lockdown until 9 November in an effort to curb the spread of the virus. Scotlandhas introduced a new five-tiered system which is set to come into force on Monday. People have been advised not to travel to or from England except for essential purposes. Northern Irelandhas closed pubs and restaurants for four weeks, with the exception of takeaways and deliveries. Gyms will be among the venues that have to close During the news conference, it was explained that the number of hospital admissions is rising rapidly. Scientists have made a projection to see how the number of daily admissions would rise over the next six weeks. As shown by the graph below, the number would surpass the figures of the first wave. Graphs show that those in the older age categories are driving hospital admission rates. However the number of admissions are rising for categories over the age of 15. The number of people with Covid-19 in inpatient beds in England has also risen, as shown by the chart below. Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent Boris Johnson has been trying to avoid this for weeks. The
scientists called for a circuit-breaker weeks ago â Labour have been doing the
same for the last fortnight. The government is still defending the local lockdown
strategy but things have changed. The graphs we saw in the press conference
show a real risk the NHS could be overwhelmed if action isnât taken now. The
PMâs argument is that he is reacting to a virus that is now spreading far
quicker than feared. But some will look at the warnings of the last few weeks and
ask why this action wasnât taken sooner. Tiered measures are not having a big enough effect on virus
transmission, Professor Neil Ferguson from Imperial College has warned. He told the BBC News relaxed measures
meant the virus had resurged. âWhilst the tier two, tier three measures are having some effect,
it doesnât seem to be enough. If we want to get very high infection levels
down, we need to impose more measures particularly ahead of Christmas."" he said. He added there was always some question as to whether tier three measures were sufficient and insisted it had proved not to be the case. Mr Ferguson warned that infection levels will increase again, adding: ""The important question is what will follow this lockdown."" Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent This is one of the starkest updates weâve seen from the government for months. Although elements of the lockdown will look different this time, the PM has returned to the theme that dominated our lives earlier this year: âStay at homeâ. He is defending his
strategy so far â the local interventions designed to avoid this national
lockdown. He says the picture has been evolving. But there will be big political
questions for the government â remember, Labour have been calling for a circuit-breaker for weeks now. Mr Johnson thanked people for tuning in. He said: ""Just to repeat, the three rays of sunshine of optimism from our scientific medical adviser. ""The prospect of better drugs, realistic prospect of a vaccine and the hopes that we're placing in rapid turnaround testing that we're rolling out across the country. ""In the meantime we have to put in place these tougher measures. Don't forget the basics, hand, space, face, get a test."" Pallab GhoshScience correspondent, BBC News The government was advised to bring in a form of
lockdown in England by its scientific advisory group on 21 September. Instead,
it opted first for 22:00 GMT closing of pubs and restaurants. This was followed a
few weeks later by its tier system where the greatest restrictions would be
placed in the worst-hit areas. Purely from a public health point of view, bringing in a
lockdown when the experts advised it would have been the sensible thing to do.
It would have been shorter, brought cases down more quickly and given the test-and-trace
system a chance to catch up with the rise in cases. But minsters had to
consider the economic impact as well as the politics. They had hoped their
light-touch approach might have been enough to control the spread of the virus
while preserving jobs and businesses. Many scientists on the scientific
advisory group were deeply sceptical at the time that this would work. All of
them appreciate the difficult decisions ministers are faced with and none of
them take any satisfaction from having been proved right. Asked about the Premier League, the prime minister says football will continue. Giving a big thumbs up, Mr Johnson says: ""Yes to the Premier League"". Matches are currently taking place but with strict rules for players and no live audiences. Prof Whitty says those who were shielding - just over two million people - still need to take extra precautions. However, he explains that the government does not want to ""reproduce"" the shielding programme from the spring. ""There were both some practical problems and there was also the issue of people having significant problems with loneliness and feeling completely cut off from society,"" he says. He says the government wants to ""avoid those downsides"". Reality Check Unlike the March lockdown,
universities will not be required to close during this new period of tougher
restrictions. On 21 September, government
advisory group Sage recommended that all university teaching should be
moved online unless absolutely essential. The group has suggested closing
universities would have a âmoderate impactâ on transmission, as the high level
of close contact students have at university â through shared halls,
socialising and during lectures â makes outbreaks very likely. This has proved to be the case;
within weeks of students returning to university, about 40 universities had
reports of coronavirus, with thousands of students having to self-isolate. Many
universities have been switching tuition online. Prof Whitty says ""the idea that there is some perfect time to act is a complete misapprehension"". He says ""all the solutions are bad"" and the government is trying to go with ""the least bad set of solutions"". He adds: ""Let us see how this goes over the next few weeks."" The PM is asked whether he should have followed the scientific advice more closely and whether he has any regrets. He says: ""We have to balance that scientific advice with the consequences for people's lives, for people's mental health, people's livelihoods that comes from lockdown measures."" He stresses that schools are being kept open, and he wants to keep construction and manufacturing open. ""I'm not going to pretend to you that these judgements aren't incredibly difficult,"" he says. ""We have to change with the changing pattern of the virus. And, alas, what we're seeing now is a pretty consistent surge."" He adds: ""We have to deal with it."" Â© 2025 BBC.

"Nicola Sturgeon said only essential journeys should be made across the border with England Nicola Sturgeon has told people not to travel to or from England except for ""essential purposes"". The first minister issued the appeal as Boris Johnson prepared to announce a month-long lockdown south of the border. Ms Sturgeon said her government would ""take account"" of the developments but would base decisions on Scottish measures on circumstances in Scotland. She said there were early signs existing action was having an impact. PM announces month-long England lockdown Boris Johnson has announced the closure of non-essential shops and hospitality, although schools and universities will remain open. It followedscientific modelling which suggested the number of deaths in the UK could rise much higher than anticipated,possibly as high as 4,000 a day by mid December, without further action. Earlier on Saturday, as speculation about new restrictions mounted, Ms Sturgeon indicated that Scotland would continue with its regional tiered strategy for the time being. A newfive-level system of restrictions will come into force in Scotland on Monday,which will see travel restrictions imposed on many Scots. She tweeted: ""Prevalance of the virus is currently lower than in other parts of the UK and there are early signs that the tough restrictions in place since we moved quickly in late September have started to slow the rate of the increase"".

She urged people not to travel to or from areas in Scotland under level 3 restrictions and added: ""For now, we are asking people not to travel to or from England at all, except for essential purposes."" Ms Sturgeon said decisions on action beyond this would consider what financial support was available as a consequence of any new restrictions in England. Earlier public health expert Prof Linda Bauld warned the path of the pandemic in Scotland over the next fortnight would determine whether the country goes into lockdown. She told the BBC'sGood Morning Scotland: ""You can see from the figures in Scotland that the case numbers are levelling off. ""We are making progress. The question I would ask is the progress quick enough? Senior pupils to wear masks in class at level 3 and 4 What level has your area been put in? What are the new lockdown rules? On Saturday the Scottish government confirmed a further 1,101 positive cases and 24 deaths. Prof Bauld said these figures are a ""reflection of infection rates in September."" She told the programme significant action has already been taken in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Prof Bauld added: ""I think the big debate is 'Why is England dragging its feet?' That is essentially the issue."" Prof Linda Bauld said cases in Scotland are currently levelling off but the next fortnight will determine whether the country goes into lockdown Prof Bauld, of Edinburgh University, said: ""Along with the other devolved nations you can see from the latestONS data,externalthat Scotland is really in quite a different position from many parts of England so I would not assume that we are going to go the same way as England."" But looking ahead, Prof Bauld said: ""We need to continue to expect these infection rates to go up and I think that the government strategy in Scotland is to keep an eye on the situation over the next week or two. ""My feeling would be unless we see improvements, particularly in some parts of the central belt, we really, realistically, could be looking at level 4, which we want to avoid but would be necessary, essentially just to avoid these preventable deaths escalating even further."" She also cautioned that in order to get the R-number below one it is possible the existing measures will not be sufficient. The latest estimate for Scotland is that the R-number is between 1 and 1.3, a slight fall on the previous estimate. Prof Bauld said: ""If the trends go in the wrong direction again then I think everybody in the country recognises that more action will be taken."" Motherwell is one of the towns in Scotland's central belt which will be under level 3 restrictions from Monday The Scottish government has meanwhile launched a new campaign to warn the general public of the serious implications of ""twisting the rules"". It highlights how even small lapses in compliance have an impact not only on health, but the economy and wider society. Launching the campaign, Ms Sturgeon acknowledged the ""huge sacrifices"" that have been made since March. She added: ""I know that people are tired and frustrated, but at this critical point in the pandemic, I want to remind people that the decisions they make over the coming days and weeks have a real impact on not only themselves but others. ""Right now, we rely more than ever on public willingness to adhere to the measures in place."" Ms Sturgeon said the new new protection levels should enable communities to ""control outbreaks quickly and effectively and minimise transmission of the virus"". But she added: ""If we all put our own twist on the rules, they simply won't work."" RULES:What are the restrictions in Scotland?

"Boris Johnson will hold a news conference later as the government considers a new month-long lockdown across England. The hope is that stricter measures could then be eased by Christmas. It comes as documents seen by the BBC suggest the UK ison course for a much higher death tollthan during the first wave unless further restrictions are introduced. Deaths could reach more than 4,000 a day, one of the models suggests. That figure is based on no policies being brought in to slow the spread of the disease, but most of the models peak at about 2,000 a day. 'A new lockdown will be far worse for businesses' Covid spreading faster than 'worst-case scenario' Winter virus plans revealed in leaked Sage report The prime minister will be joined by England's chief medical officer Chris Whitty and the government's chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance for the briefing, following a cabinet meeting to discuss the government's coronavirus response. The news conference was originally scheduled for 16:00 GMT but is now due to take place an hour later at 17:00. It is expected schools, colleges and universities would stay open under any new ""stay at home"" order. It feels like history is repeating itself. In March, the government was trying to slow rather than stop the virus. Then modelling said huge numbers of people would die andwe ended up in lockdown. A key difference this time is the government's science advisers called for a circuit-breaker six weeks ago. The price of delay is cases are higher and we have missed the boat for doing it at the same time as school holidays for extra impact. It means we may have to lockdown for longer. The spring lockdown did bring cases down. A lockdown now would be expected to do the same. There is an ambition to keep schools open, but there are growing doubts about secondarieswhere Covid cases are ""increasing steeply"",external. Deaths will continue to rise throughout a suggested November lockdown, but the hope is driving levels of the virus low enough would allow the struggling NHS Test and Trace programme to become effective again. The driving motivation here is saving lives and not overwhelming the NHS. There is no guarantee it will deliver a normal Christmas, too. Ahead of the news conference, school and university unions called for education institutions to be closed and for teaching to move online in another national lockdown. The National Education Union said it would be ""self-defeating"" to ignore how schools helped to spread the virus. And ""the health and safety of the country is being put at risk"" by the insistence on keeping in-person teaching on campuses, the University and College Union said. Mr Johnson has so far resisted pressure to introduce nationwide restrictions, opting instead for a three-tiered system targeting local areas in England. But Tees Valley Mayor Ben Houchen said talks with the government over the area moving into tier three restrictions. which were due to take place on Monday, have been ""paused"". Elsewhere in the UK, Wales remains under a 17-day ""firebreak"" lockdown until 9 November, and Scotland's new tiered system of restrictions will come into force at 06:00 on Monday. In Northern Ireland, pubs and restaurants were closed for four weeks on 16 October with the exception of takeaways and deliveries. Schools were closed for two weeks. Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford saidthe firebreak there will end as planned, and that his cabinet will meet on Sunday to ""discuss any potential border issues for Wales in light of any announcement by No 10"".

Infection rates are also soaring across much of Europe, prompting new forms of lockdownin Belgium, France and Germany. Several different projections of the likely course of the disease appear in the official UK documents seen by the BBC, which are understood to be part of a presentation by the government's pandemic modelling group SPI-M shown to Mr Johnson. All models predict that hospitalisations are likely to peak in mid-December, with deaths rising until at least late December before falling from early January. And a separate document circulating in government - based on NHS England modelling from 28 October - warns that the NHS would be unable to accept any more patients by Christmas, even if the Nightingale hospitals are used and non-urgent procedures cancelled. It warns that south-west England and the Midlands will be the first to run out of capacity, potentially within a fortnight. One key document shows several UK daily death projections by different modellers, compared with the first wave and the government's ""reasonable worst-case scenario"" - which was seen in a report in August These latest papers come aftera statement from the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) revealedthat Covid is spreading much faster in England than the predicted ""worst case"" scenario. This scenario had estimated85,000 deaths from Covid during winter. But in the Sage statement - dated 14 October and published on Friday - scientists estimated that, by mid-October, there were between 43,000 and 74,000 people being infected with coronavirus every day in England. Their report said: ""This is significantly above the profile of the reasonable worst-case scenario, where the number of daily infections in England remained between 12,000-13,000 throughout October."" Scientists advising the government have been arguingfor a short, planned lockdown- called a ""circuit-breaker"" - since 21 September, when there were around 5,000 confirmed cases a day. Earlier this month, the World Health Organization (WHO) saidlockdowns were ""not sustainable"",externaland should be ""limited in duration"" due to their ""severe economic, social and broader health impacts"". While the WHO acknowledged that during the pandemic ""there have been times when restrictions were necessary and there may be other times in the future"", it said lockdowns are ""best used to prepare for longer-term public health measures"". SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? SUPPORT BUBBLES:What are they and who can be in yours? FACE MASKS:When do I need to wear one? SCHOOLS:What will happen if children catch coronavirus? TESTING:What tests are available? The possible new restrictions have prompted fresh calls for more financial help for affected businesses, on the day the furlough scheme ends and is replaced by the Chancellor Rishi Sunak's new Job Support Scheme (JSS). Business groups said firms which had already been hit hard were now facing further anxiety. Kate Nicholls, chief executive of UK Hospitality, told BBC Breakfast a national lockdown would be ""absolutely devastating"" for the industry and called for the sector to receive ""significant additional help in order to get through this"". Her concerns were echoed by Federation of Small Businesses chair Mike Cherry, who said another lockdown would be ""incredibly frustrating"" as small businesses and businesses across the UK had ""spend thousands"" in making sure their premises are safe for employees and customers. But scientists advising the government have backed the measures, including Sage member Prof John Edmunds who said the only way to have a ""relatively safe"" Christmas is to take ""stringent"" action now to bring the incidence of the virus ""right down"". The current estimate of the R number in the UK - the number of people each infected person passes the virus on to on average - is between 1.1 and 1.3, indicating that cases are still growing. On Friday, 274 deaths were announced, meaning that since the start of the pandemic 46,229 people have died within 28 days of a positive test.

It has come afterWorkington Tory MP Mark Jenkinson said,external""I know in my constituency that, as tiny as a minority it might be, food parcels are sold or traded"" for illegal substances. A Stockton woman who relies on the parcels said: ""What kind of drug dealer would swap drugs for a tin of beans or pasta? It's just not true.""

Marcus Rashford's petition to get the government to change its mind has more than one million signatures Manchester United and England footballer Rashford has called on the government to provide free lunches during school holidays amid fears over family incomes during the coronavirus pandemic. His Parliamentary petitionsaid ""no child should be going hungry"". The UK government extended free school meals to eligible children during the Easter holidays earlier this year and, after a high-profile campaign by Rashford, did the same for the summer holiday. But last week,Conservative MPs rejected Labour's Opposition Day motionto further extend free school meals by 322 votes to 261, with five Tory MPs rebelling. The government said it had already introduced more effective measures to support families. Families and community groups on Teesside said the decision not to extend the vouchers across holidays needed to be reversed. The White Feather Project, which started in March, has been running two community shops in North Ormesby and Brambles Farm where people have been able to get food essentials by making a small donation. Mark Horkan, who runs the project, said people needed more help than ever before, adding: ""If it wasn't for the likes of Marcus Rashford the government would close the door. ""It's all right saying 'no child will go hungry' - they are. It proves it when we have to do this,"" he said. Children may be able to receive free school mealsif their parent or carer receives at least one of the following:,external Income Support Income-based Jobseeker's Allowance Income-related Employment and Support Allowance Support under Part VI of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 The guaranteed element of Pension Credit Child Tax Credit (provided you're not also entitled to Working Tax Credit and have an annual gross income of no more than Â£16,190) Working Tax Credit run-on - paid for 4 weeks after you stop qualifying for Working Tax Credit Universal Credit - if you apply on or after 1 April 2018 your household income must be less than Â£7,400 a year (after tax and not including any benefits you get) A Middlesbrough mother-of-two, who did not want to be named, said the shop in North Ormesby ""really helps"". ""My kids are 10 and 13, they eat me out of house and home basically"" she said. ""I'm on benefits. It's been extremely tough."" She said without extra help available, there was a risk her two children would go hungry. ""No kid should go hungry, regardless of their situation. It's absolutely terrible,"" she added. The Thornaby Hub in Stockton is run by community charity Little Sprouts The Thornaby Hub in Stockton hands out food twice a week and is run by wellbeing charity Little Sprouts. Debbie Fixter from the charity said the vouchers given to parents over the Easter holiday ""absolutely worked"". ""When people say they're just a sticking plasterâ¦ that's just wrong,"" she said. ""I know last week, four people sold their phones because they needed food. That's the reality of it. ""Everything is online or on the phone, we make an assumption that people have access to these things but they haven't."" The White Feather Project runs two community shops Amanda Bailey, director of the North East Child Poverty Commission, said: ""I don't think any parent chooses to be in a position where they struggle to feed their family, and I would challenge anyone to live on the income of someone below the poverty line, month after month, and experience the relentless stress this causes. ""Child poverty is not an unsolvable problem. While the North East has seen the steepest recent increase in rates of child poverty, it actually experienced the biggest reduction between 1999 and 2013, which shows it can be done."" Cabinet minister Brandon Lewis said: ""We've put the uplift into universal credit, just over Â£1,000 a year. ""But also very specifically we've put Â£63m into local authorities to support and help people in hardship... and a number of local authorities are using it to do exactly that. ""We've put that support in there and I think that's the right way to do it because the schools aren't open so it's making sure that the welfare system can put the support in, targeted where it's needed most.""

"Donald Trump, Joe Biden, and their running mates criss-cross the country wooing voters three days ahead of the 3 November election Barack Obama joins forces with Biden in Michigan Trump targets the crucial battleground state of Pennsylvania While Trump and Biden campaign in northern states, Mike Pence is in North Carolina and Kamala Harris is in Florida Some 90 million people have already voted ahead of election day on Tuesday The country is course for its highest electoral turnout rate in more than a century On Friday the US once again broke its daily coronavirus record with more than 94,000 new cases Edited by Boer Deng Stevie Wonder performed for Biden in Detroit  Thanks for following our live coverage of the 2020 US election campaign on this Halloween Saturday. Some highlights from this frantic day of campaigning three days before election day: Our team will be back in the morning to bring you the latest news and features. Biden will be speaking in Pennsylvania while Trump is due to attend events in five different states. Today's live updates were brought to you by Boer Deng, Max Matza, Patrick Jackson and Helier Cheung. Police have used pepper spray to break up an anti-racist march to a polling station in a small town in North Carolina, local media report. At least 12 people were arrested,external, including a journalist, in the town of Graham, Alamance County, the News & Observer reports. Police had escorted the 200 or so marchers, who included local Democratic politicians, from a church to the town's Court Square, where a rally was held to encourage people to turn out and vote. But at one point police began clearing the road, and pepper spray was fired, with several young children affected. It is unclear how many marchers were unable to cast their ballots at the polling station, where the last day of early voting was under way. Faith Cook, one of the few marchers to make it to the polling station, told the paper: âIâve never experienced anything like that. Nobody should have to."" A quirky new poll out from YouGov and the Daily Show comedy programme has asked American voters some unusual questions, and heard back some equally strange answers. For instance, more Americans think Biden can be trusted to carve a turkey dinner or help them with their taxes over Trump - who famously has refused to release his tax returns. They also think the Democrat would be better at helping you get over a romantic breakup or run a doggy daycare centre. Trump, Americans say, would be better at recording a rap song or mixing a cosmopolitan cocktail over Biden. But more Americans say they would turn to the thrice-married president for help setting up an online dating profile or solving a computer problem. Reality Check President Trump has criticised plans to expand postal voting in the election, claiming it leads to widespread fraud - but what evidence is there? The US is in uncharted territory during the coronavirus pandemic as a record number of Americans vote by post. Election authorities and the postal service have been put under immense strain processing the millions of extra ballots. This has led to claims the system is unsafe and susceptible to manipulation. Numerous national and state-level studies have shown that although there have been isolated cases, electoral fraud is very rare. There have been a few, well-publicised cases, such as in the 2018 North Carolina primary, which was re-run after a consultant for the Republican candidate tampered with voting papers. But the rate of voting fraud overall in the US is less than 0.0009%, according to a 2017 study by the Brennan Center for Justice. And Federal Election Commission head Ellen Weintraub has said: ""There's simply no basis for the conspiracy theory that voting by mail causes fraud."" Read the full analysis, and more on places where fraud has been claimed this year, here. Trump and Biden are each now holding events A frenzied day of campaigning for Donald Trump and Joe Biden continues now as the rivals hold simultaneous events in two different swing states. Trump is due to appear in Butler, Pennsylvania - the third of four events he has in the state today - after earlier turning up in Newtown, a suburb of Philadelphia, and Reading, a bit further west. There, he joked about his family's recent brush with coronavirus. Both the president and first lady caught the virus, and Trump spent several days in hospital before recovering. Of their diagnoses, he said: ""At least those rumours that we don't live together proved to be false"". Meanwhile, Biden is due to turn up in Detroit, Michigan for his second rally of the day with help from his former boss, Barack Obama. He is due to get an extra boost from another special guest: Stevie Wonder. For a bit of Halloween fun, outspoken singer Lizzo has revealed her risque but zeitgeist-y costume - and no it's not a Trump wig. The Biden campaigner posted an image where she donned black wigs and insect eyes and was photoshopped onto Vice-President Mike Pence's head. The outfit is a reference to the fly that sat on Pence's head for over a minute during the vice-presidential debate. The incident sparked memes aplenty and led Biden to pose for a photo with a fly-swatter. Some businesses near the White House have been boarded up Students at the George Washington University in the US capital have reportedly been advised to stock up on essential goods like food and prescription medicines ahead of election day. Warning students living on or near campus of""potential disruptions... during the election period"",external, it advised them to have supplies for at least one week, a WTOP Radio report says, quoting a spokesperson. According to the radio, the advice is to ""prepare for election season as they would for a hurricane or blizzard"". Election day itself is designated a holiday by the university. Businesses in the city have been boarding up doors and windows as a precaution against rioting after the election results are announced. Every 30 seconds, a Latino in the US turns 18 and becomes eligible to vote. If they turn out, young Latino voters could swing the outcome of the election. Little wonder that both the Trump and Biden campaigns are eager to court them. BBC spoke to five first-time Latino voters from around the country to find out what issues they care most about - and of course, which presidential candidate they will be voting for. This video can not be played US election: What Latino first-time voters want Vice-President Mike Pence has spoken at a rally at the airport in Elizabeth City, North Carolina. ""We need North Carolina to show America that this is Trump country,"" he told supporters in the swing state. The attack continued the Trump campaign's strategy - painting Biden as corrupted by foreign powers. Biden's campaign denies any wrongdoing and claims that it is actually the Trump family that is guilty of influence peddling. ""Joe Biden has been a cheerleader for communist China all along,"" Pence claimed. He also called for voters to boot out the Democratic governor whose Covid-19 restrictions spoilt Republican plans to host their party conference there during the pandemic. Ebun Ekunwe voted for Trump in 2016 and Biden in 2020. BBC has been speaking to voters around the US to get their perspectives on the 2020 election. Ebun Ekunwe, 72, is a retired doctor and an associate pastor at her local church in Carrollton, Texas. She voted for Donald Trump in 2016 but now believes âthe man who promised to drain the swamp has only succeeded in poisoning the waters.â âI voted my conscience,â she said. âHe has spent four years upending the first letter of the Constitution: instead of 'We the People' he has made it 'Me the People.' Iâm keeping my fingers crossed that, with people fully energised like never before, we can turn it back to 'We the People.'â She queued early to vote for Joe Biden at her neighbourhood polling station, the public library. She cast her vote for the Democrat ânot because of his policies, but because civility matters to me.â Ebun is a member of our voter panel.You'll be hearing more from our other panelists throughout the week. More on the theme of Halloween today: a viral TikTok video of two twin girls in Oklahoma is drawing in eyeballs, after their mother dressed them as presidential candidates for Halloween. Four-year-olds Haven and Koti were born right before the 2016 election, their mother told KFOR-TV. âThey know they were Joe Biden and Donald Trump and see them on TV talking all the time, so they know theyâre somebody. I donât think they understand quite yet who they are,â said mum Adrea Garza. Garza told Good Morning America some people had criticised her costume choice for her girls, saying they should have dressed up as princesses instead. Her response? ""There's nothing wrong with dressing as a princess. My girls do it all the time. But there's nothing wrong with dressing as the president of the United States either."" As we mentioned earlier, a photo of two girls dressed up as Kamala Harris and her sister also delighted many -including Harris's younger sister, Maya,external. Building a ""big, beautiful wall"" between the US and Mexico was the signature promise of President Donald Trump's 2016 election campaign. A concrete barrier, he said, would serve to stop what he described as a flow of illegal immigrants and drugs over the border. But what actually happened to the wall? How much of it has been built? And how effective has it been? The BBC's Lucy Rodgers and Dominic Bailey have put togethersome charts and graphics to help explain.  Melania Trump made her second solo appearance of the 2020 campaign today in Wisconsin. She delivered pre-prepared lines from beneath a chandelier inside a packed barn. ""Joe Biden says he could do a better job leading our great nation,"" she said. ""Apparently when you hide in a basement, you feel safe communicating your wishful thinking.â The attack line echoes her husband's claim that Biden's effort to avoid people, which Biden says is due to social distancing measures made necessary due to the virus, keeps him ""hiding in the basement"". In addition to ""sleepy Joe,"" Trump occasionally has called him ""hidin' Biden"".  Biden dismissed the joke earlier today by tweeted a photo of one of his drive-in rallies. Unlike at Trump rallies, guests mostly socially distance and wear masks at Biden events. The first lady will giving more remarks in Pennsylvania, the ""keystone state"", later today, where her husband is campaigning. It's that kind of election year in America... some businesses in cities have been boarding up their doors and windows as a precaution against possible violent protests after Tuesday's vote. As we mentioned earlier, one poll suggests that nearly 56% of US voters are worried the presidential election will lead to an increase in violence. Workers covered the windows at The Hay-Adams hotel in Washington DC Boards covering the door of one office near the White House bear the slogan ""Black Lives Matter"" In New York City, plywood protects windows on a Macy's department store Businesses in Chicago began boarding up weeks ago in anticipation of election unrest California Senator Kamala Harris, the Democratic vice-presidential pick, is in the Miami area today. Harris appeared at her first of three events of the day with rapper Fat Joe and celebrity chef Jose AndrÃ©s. She encouraged the audience to vote, and slammed Trump's handling of the coronavirus. Democrats fret that early voters may not be turning out in Florida in the numbers needed for Biden to win the crucially important state. Meanwhile, Vice-President Mike Pence is in North Carolina, another swing state, for two events today. There, Republicans are nervous. Ready to run... astronaut Mark Kelly, football coach Tommy Tuberville and trucker Kelly Loeffler ""An astronaut, a pastor and an American football coach walk into the US Senate"" sounds like the opening to a joke, but that is what could happen when winners of the 2020 general election take their seats in Congress. While attention has been hyper-focused on the battle for the White House, an equally important fight is underway for control of Washington. Here are a few of the candidates to keep an eye on:  Read more: The five Senate races to watch Tangier Island, a part of Virginia, is slowly disappearing due to erosion and rising water levels, but this US community of fishermen is putting its faith in a sea wall - and President Trump - to protect their homes, jobs and way of life.

In his first appearance stumping for his former vice-president, Obama compared Donald Trump's character to Biden's. ""It used to be that being a man meant taking care of other people... not looking for credit but trying to live right..."" Obama said. ""When you elect Joe, that's what you'll see reflected from the White House."" Taking the stage, Biden paid tribute to Obama, saying his eight years in the White House had been free from scandal. ""It's time for Donald Trump to pack his bags and go home,"" he said. ""We're done with the chaos."" BBC has been speaking to voters around the US to get their perspectives on the 2020 election.

""You can choose change,"" Obama said to the beeping of horns. ""You can choose a better America."" He condemned President Donald Trump's handling of the coronavirus pandemic, saying his main concern seemed to be the size of the crowds at his rallies.

"This video can not be played Rescue workers pulled people from collapsed buildings Rescue teams in the Turkish port city of Izmir are hunting through the rubble of collapsed buildings for survivors of Friday's powerful earthquake. The death toll from the quake, which also struck the Greek island of Samos, has risen to 30, with over 800 injured. A mother and three children were freed in Izmir 18 hours after the quake, as hundreds of aftershocks hit the area. The US Geological Survey (USGS) said the earthquake was 7.0 magnitude, but Turkey put it lower at 6.6. The shallow tremor triggered tidal waves that hit coastal areas and islands in both Turkey and Greece. Twenty-eight people were killed in Izmir, in the west of Turkey, officials said. A girl and a boy died in Samos when a wall collapsed on them. Work continued through the night to search for survivors in 20 buildings in Izmir that were destroyed as a result of the earthquake. Officials said search and rescue operations had been completed in eight buildings, while operations continued in nine other locations. A mother and three children who had been trapped for almost 18 hours under a building were brought out by rescuers. Efforts were continuing to rescue the woman's fourth child. ""We are delighted to be hearing miracles happening as a result of diligent work by rescue teams,"" Izmir Mayor Tunc Soyer told local TV. Some 100 survivors have been pulled out alive from the rubble so far, Turkey's Environment and Urbanisation Minister Murat Kurum told reporters. Mr Soyer said about another 180 remained trapped. Relatives of people missing stand by as rescue operations continue in Izmir Authorities in central Izmir have set up a tent area to house about 2,000 people overnight, amid fears that more buildings could collapse. Nearly 4,000 rescue workers, 475 vehicles and 20 sniffer dogs have been deployed, Turkey's state-run Anadolu news agency reports. But their work has been hampered by nearly 400 aftershocks, according to Turkey's national disaster agency Afad, with 33 of these more powerful than 4.0 magnitude. Rescuers are working hour after hour searching for life under mounds of crushed concrete. There are clusters of distraught relatives outside a flattened apartment block, which was eight stories high. As many as 40 residents are still unaccounted for - among them 15-year-old twins. Field kitchens and tents have been set up for those who are homeless and traumatised. Turkey is now suffering from collective aftershock - as local TV channels provide continuous coverage of the rescue efforts. This was the second powerful earthquake this year.  There are renewed fears about the active fault lines beneath the country. Many worry when the next deadly quake may come. The earthquake struck 14km (nine miles) off the Greek town of Karlovasi on Samos island at 13:51 local time (11:51 GMT), according to the USGS. It said the quake - which was felt as far away as Athens and Istanbul - struck at a depth of 21km (13 miles), although Turkish officials said it was 16km below ground. This video can not be played Powerful earthquake destroys buildings and causes flooding on Turkey's Aegean coast Most of the damage occurred in Izmir, off Turkey's Aegean coast - where the tremor sent many people running out into the streets in fear and panic. ""It was a really strong shaker almost enough to knock you off your feet. Running out of the house with my children was like a drunken wobble,"" Chris Bedford, a retired British teacher who lives in Urla, west of Izmir, told the BBC. There were reports of flooding in Izmir after the sea level rose, with one person killed after their wheelchair was hit and overturned by rising water. Izmir is Turkey's third largest city with a population of nearly three million. Turkey and Greece both sit on fault lines and earthquakes are common. Two teenagers were killed when a wall collapsed on Samos. Eight people were injured across the island, where about 45,000 people reside. A mini-tsunami flooded the port of Samos and a number of buildings were damaged. Greek officials put the magnitude of the tremor at 6.7. ""We felt it very strongly,"" local journalist Manos Stefanakis told the BBC, adding that smaller aftershocks were continuing. He said it was the biggest tremor to have hit the island since 1904. This video can not be played Footage shows town on Greek island of Samos flooded by earthquake Fareid Atta, another Samos-based journalist, told the BBC that the damage was ""quite extensive along the seafront"" of the island's main town. ""Many businesses will be going under after this,"" he said. Residents were urged to stay outdoors and keep away from coastal areas. Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said he had offered his condolences to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. On Samos, residents were urged to stay outdoors as aftershocks continued ""Whatever our differences, these are times when our people need to stand together,external,"" Mr Mitsotakis wrote in a tweet. Mr Erdoganlater responded in a tweet,external: ""Turkey, too, is always ready to help Greece heal its wounds. That two neighbours show solidarity in difficult times is more valuable than many things in life."" Relations between Greece and Turkey have been particularly strained in recent months by a dispute relating to control of territorial waters in the Mediterranean and the resources beneath them. In Januarymore than 30 people were killed and more than 1,600 injuredwhen an earthquake struck Sivrice in Turkey's eastern Elazig province. In July 2019, the Greek capital Athens was hit by a tremor thatknocked out power to large parts of the city. A powerful quake that struck the Turkish city of Izmit, near Istanbul, in 1999 killed about 17,000 people. Are you in an area affected by the earthquake?

"Businessman Luke Johnson says people are despairing and lockdowns are a ""blunt instrument"" which also have consequences Multiple business leaders have hit out at the looming prospect of a second national lockdown in England, saying the potential damage ""is immense"". Businessman Luke Johnson says the country cannot afford another lockdown.

This week, the London Ambulance Service revealed that it is now attending an average of 37 suicides a day, or attempted suicides, up from 22 a day in 2019. ""I think that is a direct consequence of lockdown. People are losing their jobs, they are lonely, depressed, the mental health toll on the country is exponential,"" says Mr Johnson, who formerly ran Pizza Express, Patisserie Valerie and the Giraffe chain.

The hospitality industry cannot afford to have a poor December this year,"" says Gary Forrest, chief executive of the High Street Group, which owns a large chain of bars, restaurants and hotels across the north-east of England. Mr Forrest was particularly frustrated that pubs and restaurants such as his have invested in measures to protect their customers, but now the industry ""seems to be bearing the brunt of the government's restrictions"". ""They told us to bring in table service - and the cost of table service is huge, your salary costs go up exponentially - and all the technology changes, but then they still come along and say, 'now you still need to shut the bars at 10pm',"" he says. ""I'm worried about the 300 people we employ, who've got mortgages and rent to pay."" Mr Forrest wants to see a system where venues are certified by the local authorities and regularly checked to ensure compliance with safety rules. And he wants more support for firms and venues located in parts of the UK where restrictions are in place, but fall short of a full lockdown with mandatory closures. He says the support for businesses operating in this 'Tier 2' environment is not sufficient. But not all business leaders are against the government's coronavirus restrictions.

Ms Marks says she already has an order book full of events starting from next March, and that the UK has to get through the pandemic to the other side so that the events industry can resume. However, she says that isn't possible without support from the government. ""I'm devastated about the support the government has not given our industry. We've been completely ignored, and we're a billion pound industry,"" she explains.

"This video can not be played Rescue workers pulled people from collapsed buildings Rescue teams in the Turkish port city of Izmir are hunting through the rubble of collapsed buildings for survivors of Friday's powerful earthquake. The death toll from the quake, which also struck the Greek island of Samos, has risen to 30, with over 800 injured. A mother and three children were freed in Izmir 18 hours after the quake, as hundreds of aftershocks hit the area. The US Geological Survey (USGS) said the earthquake was 7.0 magnitude, but Turkey put it lower at 6.6. The shallow tremor triggered tidal waves that hit coastal areas and islands in both Turkey and Greece. Twenty-eight people were killed in Izmir, in the west of Turkey, officials said. A girl and a boy died in Samos when a wall collapsed on them. Work continued through the night to search for survivors in 20 buildings in Izmir that were destroyed as a result of the earthquake. Officials said search and rescue operations had been completed in eight buildings, while operations continued in nine other locations. A mother and three children who had been trapped for almost 18 hours under a building were brought out by rescuers. Efforts were continuing to rescue the woman's fourth child. ""We are delighted to be hearing miracles happening as a result of diligent work by rescue teams,"" Izmir Mayor Tunc Soyer told local TV. Some 100 survivors have been pulled out alive from the rubble so far, Turkey's Environment and Urbanisation Minister Murat Kurum told reporters. Mr Soyer said about another 180 remained trapped. Relatives of people missing stand by as rescue operations continue in Izmir Authorities in central Izmir have set up a tent area to house about 2,000 people overnight, amid fears that more buildings could collapse. Nearly 4,000 rescue workers, 475 vehicles and 20 sniffer dogs have been deployed, Turkey's state-run Anadolu news agency reports. But their work has been hampered by nearly 400 aftershocks, according to Turkey's national disaster agency Afad, with 33 of these more powerful than 4.0 magnitude. Rescuers are working hour after hour searching for life under mounds of crushed concrete. There are clusters of distraught relatives outside a flattened apartment block, which was eight stories high. As many as 40 residents are still unaccounted for - among them 15-year-old twins. Field kitchens and tents have been set up for those who are homeless and traumatised. Turkey is now suffering from collective aftershock - as local TV channels provide continuous coverage of the rescue efforts. This was the second powerful earthquake this year.  There are renewed fears about the active fault lines beneath the country. Many worry when the next deadly quake may come. The earthquake struck 14km (nine miles) off the Greek town of Karlovasi on Samos island at 13:51 local time (11:51 GMT), according to the USGS. It said the quake - which was felt as far away as Athens and Istanbul - struck at a depth of 21km (13 miles), although Turkish officials said it was 16km below ground. This video can not be played Powerful earthquake destroys buildings and causes flooding on Turkey's Aegean coast Most of the damage occurred in Izmir, off Turkey's Aegean coast - where the tremor sent many people running out into the streets in fear and panic. ""It was a really strong shaker almost enough to knock you off your feet. Running out of the house with my children was like a drunken wobble,"" Chris Bedford, a retired British teacher who lives in Urla, west of Izmir, told the BBC. There were reports of flooding in Izmir after the sea level rose, with one person killed after their wheelchair was hit and overturned by rising water. Izmir is Turkey's third largest city with a population of nearly three million. Turkey and Greece both sit on fault lines and earthquakes are common. Two teenagers were killed when a wall collapsed on Samos. Eight people were injured across the island, where about 45,000 people reside. A mini-tsunami flooded the port of Samos and a number of buildings were damaged. Greek officials put the magnitude of the tremor at 6.7. ""We felt it very strongly,"" local journalist Manos Stefanakis told the BBC, adding that smaller aftershocks were continuing. He said it was the biggest tremor to have hit the island since 1904. This video can not be played Footage shows town on Greek island of Samos flooded by earthquake Fareid Atta, another Samos-based journalist, told the BBC that the damage was ""quite extensive along the seafront"" of the island's main town. ""Many businesses will be going under after this,"" he said. Residents were urged to stay outdoors and keep away from coastal areas. Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said he had offered his condolences to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. On Samos, residents were urged to stay outdoors as aftershocks continued ""Whatever our differences, these are times when our people need to stand together,external,"" Mr Mitsotakis wrote in a tweet. Mr Erdoganlater responded in a tweet,external: ""Turkey, too, is always ready to help Greece heal its wounds. That two neighbours show solidarity in difficult times is more valuable than many things in life."" Relations between Greece and Turkey have been particularly strained in recent months by a dispute relating to control of territorial waters in the Mediterranean and the resources beneath them. In Januarymore than 30 people were killed and more than 1,600 injuredwhen an earthquake struck Sivrice in Turkey's eastern Elazig province. In July 2019, the Greek capital Athens was hit by a tremor thatknocked out power to large parts of the city. A powerful quake that struck the Turkish city of Izmit, near Istanbul, in 1999 killed about 17,000 people. Are you in an area affected by the earthquake?

"Lawrence Gainey said going to the gym was about more than keeping fit, and helped many with mental health Gyms and leisure centres must be classed as ""essential services"" to stop them being repeatedly closed during winter months, campaigners have warned. Wales' First Minister Mark Drakefordhas promised gyms and leisure centreswill be able to reopen on 9 November. But a group of more than 100 gym owners said they were prepared to break any future Covid lockdown laws without scientific proof they should shut. The Welsh Government would not comment on potential future closures. One gym owner said months of closure had already had a ""devastating"" impact on members' mental and physical health, and he feared what would happen if they were forced to close again during the winter. Gyms, leisure centres, swimming pools and fitness studios were among the last businesses allowed to reopen in Wales after being forced to close their doors at the end of March as part of the first lockdown. Last week, after being open for two months, they were closed again, alongside pubs, restaurants and non-essential shops, as a 17-day national""firebreak""lockdown began in a bid to curb the spread of coronavirus. Mr Drakeford warned action was needed and people must stay at home, because if cases continued to rise the NHS would not be able to cope and ""more people will die"". Obesity increases risks from Covid-19, experts say Jobs cut at Better Cardiff leisure centres due to pandemic Gyms and coronavirus: What are the facts? Some medical experts have saidgyms could help the virus to spread, as they are humid and confined spaces with people sharing equipment. Prof Jonathan Ball, expert in viruses at the University of Nottingham, said people exercising breathed quite deeply andcould potentially produce droplets which could infect other people, but added risk can be lowered through things like effective air-conditioning, regular cleaning, social distancing and hand sanitising. Public Health Wales, which has been analysing a rise in cases ahead of the firebreak lockdown, blamed the rise in cases on peopletalking indoors, saying the virus was spread via ""respiratory droplets"". The Welsh Gym Owner Collective, which represents more than 100 owners of independent gyms, said they were willing to do ""whatever it takes"" to stay open, and had been ready to break the law, if they had been banned from opening on 9 November. This video can not be played Swimmers and gym-goers had said they were ""glad to be back"" Group founder Lawrence Gainey said closing facilities had already had a ""devastating"" impact on members' mental and physical health. While people are allowed to exercise outside, alone or with their household during lockdown, Mr Gainey warned bad weather and shorter days would impact badly on people already struggling. Q&A: What can you do in Wales-wide lockdown? Mr Gainey, who owns Pro Fitness in Penarth, Vale of Glamorgan, said gyms and sport centres should be classed as essential during the pandemic, and must not be closed at ""10 minutes' notice"" as many relied on the routine. ""So many of our members have said it helps their mental health, it's not just about physical health, we are really relieving pressure on the NHS,"" he said. Rooms in his gym are also used to teach self-defence to young people in areas with high levels of knife crime, and Mr Gainey said he had elderly members who came to work out every day just to see another person. Gyms were shut in Wales for about five months during lockdown Mr Gainey said gyms had spent thousands making changes to keep members safe, with members having temperature checks before being allowed to enter, and only a ""few cases"" had been linked to facilities in Wales. ""If there is a national emergency [which results in another lockdown] and it is fundamental for all businesses to close, then we will not act irresponsibly,"" he said. ""But if the science does not support the action that the government is taking, then we will push back and refuse to close."" Anna Prince said her gym was a lifeline for many women, some whom used it to escape domestic violence At Hydrofitness Ladies Gym, in Barry, Vale of Glamorgan, Anna Prince said she was prepared to stay open ""no matter what"" for her members' wellbeing. Some of the members are survivors of domestic abuse, elderly or have medical conditions, and Ms Prince said the gym, where the motto is ""no men, no mirrors"", was a safe space where they could work out and spend time with friends. ""Some of these women come from really bad homes, it is a place where they can talk and help one another, and rebuild their confidence,"" she said. ""One lady is 82, she is fitter than most 20-year-olds I've seen. She cares for her husband and it helps her keep strong so she can lift him around the house, and she's worried she's going to lose that."" The 41-year-old, who only bought the gym last summer using money left to her by her mother when she died, said she had lost about 50% of her members during the last lockdown and was struggling to pay staff and bills. She said she had spent hundreds on cleaning and safety equipment, but had done extensive research and believed staying open was the best thing to keep her members safe. ""I do not care if I get fined, my ladies come first, if they need the gym it will be open,"" she said. This video can not be played Mark Drakeford said without acting now the NHS would not be able to look after the increasing number of seriously ill people Ahead of gyms reopening in August, the first minister said: ""We know that coronavirus thrives in noisy places where people are expelling air, where it's hot and it's sweaty."" On 23 September all but essential services, including supermarkets, were closed as Wales entered a 17-day national lockdown, with people being told to stay home and only have contact with those in their household. But research by the gyms' trade body UK Active claims the number of cases linked to gyms is low, with 156 cases linked to more than five million visits between 5 and 11 October. And a petition to the Senedd calling on gyms to be classed as essential should another lockdown take place, has had more than 20,000 signatures. Earlier this week Health Minister Vaughan Gething recognised that the firebreak lockdown was ""tough"" for many people, including businesses, but urged people to abide by the rules to save lives. A report by the Technical Advisory Cell (TAC), which advises Welsh ministers on coronavirus, has warned ""multiple"" firebreaks""might be necessary to maintain low levels of incidence"" of the virus. Under coronavirus regulations businesses which refuse to close during any lockdown are committing an offence,and can face an unlimited fine,external. The Welsh Government was asked for its response to gym owners' statements regarding potentially breaking rules, but refused to comment, saying no further firebreak lockdowns were planned. A spokesman said gyms and leisure centres would reopen on 9 November alongside non-essential shops and other services. ""We are facing a public health emergency in Wales - coronavirus is spreading in every part of Wales and there is a real risk the NHS will become overwhelmed if we do not take action now,"" he said. ""We need to all work together and do everything we can to bring it back under control. The firebreak is designed to do just that.""

"Lawrence Gainey said going to the gym was about more than keeping fit, and helped many with mental health Gyms and leisure centres must be classed as ""essential services"" to stop them being repeatedly closed during winter months, campaigners have warned. Wales' First Minister Mark Drakefordhas promised gyms and leisure centreswill be able to reopen on 9 November. But a group of more than 100 gym owners said they were prepared to break any future Covid lockdown laws without scientific proof they should shut. The Welsh Government would not comment on potential future closures. One gym owner said months of closure had already had a ""devastating"" impact on members' mental and physical health, and he feared what would happen if they were forced to close again during the winter. Gyms, leisure centres, swimming pools and fitness studios were among the last businesses allowed to reopen in Wales after being forced to close their doors at the end of March as part of the first lockdown. Last week, after being open for two months, they were closed again, alongside pubs, restaurants and non-essential shops, as a 17-day national""firebreak""lockdown began in a bid to curb the spread of coronavirus. Mr Drakeford warned action was needed and people must stay at home, because if cases continued to rise the NHS would not be able to cope and ""more people will die"". Obesity increases risks from Covid-19, experts say Jobs cut at Better Cardiff leisure centres due to pandemic Gyms and coronavirus: What are the facts? Some medical experts have saidgyms could help the virus to spread, as they are humid and confined spaces with people sharing equipment. Prof Jonathan Ball, expert in viruses at the University of Nottingham, said people exercising breathed quite deeply andcould potentially produce droplets which could infect other people, but added risk can be lowered through things like effective air-conditioning, regular cleaning, social distancing and hand sanitising. Public Health Wales, which has been analysing a rise in cases ahead of the firebreak lockdown, blamed the rise in cases on peopletalking indoors, saying the virus was spread via ""respiratory droplets"". The Welsh Gym Owner Collective, which represents more than 100 owners of independent gyms, said they were willing to do ""whatever it takes"" to stay open, and had been ready to break the law, if they had been banned from opening on 9 November. This video can not be played Swimmers and gym-goers had said they were ""glad to be back"" Group founder Lawrence Gainey said closing facilities had already had a ""devastating"" impact on members' mental and physical health. While people are allowed to exercise outside, alone or with their household during lockdown, Mr Gainey warned bad weather and shorter days would impact badly on people already struggling. Q&A: What can you do in Wales-wide lockdown? Mr Gainey, who owns Pro Fitness in Penarth, Vale of Glamorgan, said gyms and sport centres should be classed as essential during the pandemic, and must not be closed at ""10 minutes' notice"" as many relied on the routine. ""So many of our members have said it helps their mental health, it's not just about physical health, we are really relieving pressure on the NHS,"" he said. Rooms in his gym are also used to teach self-defence to young people in areas with high levels of knife crime, and Mr Gainey said he had elderly members who came to work out every day just to see another person. Gyms were shut in Wales for about five months during lockdown Mr Gainey said gyms had spent thousands making changes to keep members safe, with members having temperature checks before being allowed to enter, and only a ""few cases"" had been linked to facilities in Wales. ""If there is a national emergency [which results in another lockdown] and it is fundamental for all businesses to close, then we will not act irresponsibly,"" he said. ""But if the science does not support the action that the government is taking, then we will push back and refuse to close."" Anna Prince said her gym was a lifeline for many women, some whom used it to escape domestic violence At Hydrofitness Ladies Gym, in Barry, Vale of Glamorgan, Anna Prince said she was prepared to stay open ""no matter what"" for her members' wellbeing. Some of the members are survivors of domestic abuse, elderly or have medical conditions, and Ms Prince said the gym, where the motto is ""no men, no mirrors"", was a safe space where they could work out and spend time with friends. ""Some of these women come from really bad homes, it is a place where they can talk and help one another, and rebuild their confidence,"" she said. ""One lady is 82, she is fitter than most 20-year-olds I've seen. She cares for her husband and it helps her keep strong so she can lift him around the house, and she's worried she's going to lose that."" The 41-year-old, who only bought the gym last summer using money left to her by her mother when she died, said she had lost about 50% of her members during the last lockdown and was struggling to pay staff and bills. She said she had spent hundreds on cleaning and safety equipment, but had done extensive research and believed staying open was the best thing to keep her members safe. ""I do not care if I get fined, my ladies come first, if they need the gym it will be open,"" she said. This video can not be played Mark Drakeford said without acting now the NHS would not be able to look after the increasing number of seriously ill people Ahead of gyms reopening in August, the first minister said: ""We know that coronavirus thrives in noisy places where people are expelling air, where it's hot and it's sweaty."" On 23 September all but essential services, including supermarkets, were closed as Wales entered a 17-day national lockdown, with people being told to stay home and only have contact with those in their household. But research by the gyms' trade body UK Active claims the number of cases linked to gyms is low, with 156 cases linked to more than five million visits between 5 and 11 October. And a petition to the Senedd calling on gyms to be classed as essential should another lockdown take place, has had more than 20,000 signatures. Earlier this week Health Minister Vaughan Gething recognised that the firebreak lockdown was ""tough"" for many people, including businesses, but urged people to abide by the rules to save lives. A report by the Technical Advisory Cell (TAC), which advises Welsh ministers on coronavirus, has warned ""multiple"" firebreaks""might be necessary to maintain low levels of incidence"" of the virus. Under coronavirus regulations businesses which refuse to close during any lockdown are committing an offence,and can face an unlimited fine,external. The Welsh Government was asked for its response to gym owners' statements regarding potentially breaking rules, but refused to comment, saying no further firebreak lockdowns were planned. A spokesman said gyms and leisure centres would reopen on 9 November alongside non-essential shops and other services. ""We are facing a public health emergency in Wales - coronavirus is spreading in every part of Wales and there is a real risk the NHS will become overwhelmed if we do not take action now,"" he said. ""We need to all work together and do everything we can to bring it back under control. The firebreak is designed to do just that.""

"The end of a range of government support schemes could leave millions of people facing hardship, think tanks and political groups have warned. Mortgage holidays and jobs furloughing are to end on Saturday, with other support measures starting. But there are still gaps in support that need filling, some organisations have said. The Treasury said it had put in place a number of generous support schemes for individuals and businesses. The mortgage holiday scheme introduced at the start of the Covid-19 crisis ends on Saturday as does the job furlough scheme, which is being replaced by the Job Support Scheme. It will leave a fifth of mortgage holders - around 1.6 million households - worried about paying their mortgage over the next three months, according to the Joseph Rowntree Foundation. The poverty campaign charity said: ""There is a real risk that mortgage-holders on low incomes will be pulled into poverty and hardship."" It said 890,000 working households with a mortgage expect to see a drop in earnings over the next month, but 85% of them - 750,000 households - aren't eligible for any government support with their housing costs. ""It's not right that during a time of huge uncertainty, many households are discovering that they are excluded from the only lifeline that could help meet their housing costs,"" said Darren Baxter, policy and partnerships manager at the charity. The Joseph Rowntree Foundation wants the Support for Mortgage Interest payment to be reformed to help people who lose their jobs to keep their homes as they weather the coronavirus storm. Self-employed homeowners could face a double hit as their grants are reduced, the Labour party said. ""Self-employed homeowners are facing a perfect storm because the government has decided to abandon them just as we head into the winter,"" said shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds. ""There's still time for the government to stop a bleak winter for Britain's self-employed workers. ""It must remove the mortgage cliff edge, fix the gaps in its income support schemes, and help people defer the cost of interest payments."" From November, self-employed people will be able to apply for a third grant under the Self-Employment Income Support Scheme (SEISS) to cover the next three months, worth 40% of their pre-virus trading profits. But that figure is down from the 80% offered during the first grant and 70% during the second application period. People renting their home are more likely to have fallen behind with their housing costs than mortgagers, according to the Resolution Foundation, which campaigns on living standards. Its research suggests nearly one-in-eight private renters and more than one-in-six social renters are currently unable to cover their housing costs in full. ""Renters are being particularly badly hit,"" said Lindsay Judge, research director at the Resolution Foundation. ""They are much more likely to have lost their jobs and significant numbers are only managing by cutting other expenditures, drawing down on savings or getting into debt in order to meet their rent."" She called on policymakers to ensure the social security system supports struggling families effectively over the coming months and take urgent action to avoid an increase in homelessness. ""But landlords might also need to recognise that as household incomes fall, rents are more likely to need to go down than up,"" she added. Landlords, however, have called on the government to give the sector extra help to protect those who are renting. The National Residential Landlords Association warned that 300,000 renters could be at risk of losing their jobs as the furlough scheme closes. It said renters under the age of 35 will face the brunt of the crisis as those who find themselves on benefits will only be able to claim for a room in a shared house. ""With rates of Covid-19 rising, we need to do everything possible to sustain tenancies,"" said Ben Beadle, chief executive of the NRLA. ""The government needs urgently to step in and fund renters who are struggling as a result of the pandemic."" The Treasury said the new Job Support Scheme which starts on Sunday, combined with the Job Retention Bonus, will cover at least 95% of the total employment costs for average previously furloughed employee until February. ""The Job Support Scheme will continue to protect jobs throughout the difficult months ahead and is part of our comprehensive Plan for Jobs,"" said Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rishi Sunak. The Treasury added: ""The JSS and JRB are just one part of our generous package of measures, that includes the extended business grants and Self-Employed Income Support Schemes announced last week, which will continue to support businesses and livelihoods across the country over the winter months.""

"For many, Sean Connery was the definitive James Bond. Suave and cold-hearted, his 007 was every inch the Cold War dinosaur of the books. He strode across screen, licensed to kill. He moved like a panther, hungry and in search of prey. There was no contest. His great rival, Roger Moore, by contrast, simply cocked an eyebrow, smiled and did a quip. But whereas Ian Fleming's hero went to Eton, Connery's own background was noticeably short of fast cars, beautiful women and vodka Martinis - either shaken or stirred. Thomas Sean Connery was born in the Fountainbridge area of Edinburgh on 25 August 1930, the son of a Catholic factory worker and a Protestant domestic cleaner. His father's family had emigrated from Ireland in the 19th Century; his mother traced her line back to Gaelic speakers from the Isle of Skye. The area had been in decline for years. Young Tommy Connery was brought up in one room of a tenement with a shared toilet and no hot water. He left school at 13 with no qualifications and delivered milk, polished coffins and laid bricks, before joining the Royal Navy. Three years later, he was invalided out of the service with stomach ulcers. His arms by now had tattoos which proclaimed his passions: ""Scotland forever"" and ""Mum & Dad"". In Edinburgh, he gained a reputation as ""hard man"" when six gang members tried to steal from his coat.  When he stopped them, he was followed. Connery launched a one-man assault which the future Bond won hands down. He scraped a living any way he could. He drove trucks, worked as a lifeguard and posed as a model at the Edinburgh College of Art. He spent his spare time bodybuilding. Sean Connery left school without qualifications and worked as a milkman, brick layer and coffin polisher The artist Richard Demarco, who as a student often painted Connery, described him as ""too beautiful for words, a virtual Adonis"". A keen footballer, Connery was good enough to attract the attention of Matt Busby, who offered him a Â£25-a-week contract at Manchester United. But, bitten by the acting bug when odd-jobbing at a local theatre, he decided a footballer's career was potentially too short and opted to pursue his luck on the stage. It was, he later said, ""one of my more intelligent moves"". In 1953, he was in London competing in the Mr Universe competition. He heard that there were parts going in the chorus of a production of the musical South Pacific. By the following year, he was playing the role of Lieutenant Buzz Adams, made famous on Broadway by Larry Hagman. American actor Robert Henderson encouraged Connery to educate himself. Henderson lent him works by Ibsen, Shakespeare and Bernard Shaw, and persuaded Connery to take elocution lessons. Connery made the first of many appearances as a film extra in the 1954 movie Lilacs in the Spring.  There were minor roles on television too, including a gangster in an episode of the BBC police drama Dixon of Dock Green. In 1957, he got his first leading role in Blood Money, a BBC reworking of Requiem for a Heavyweight, in which he portrayed a boxer whose career is in decline. It had been made famous in America by Hollywood legend Jack Palance. When Palance refused to travel to London, the director's wife suggested Sean. ""The ladies will like him,"" she said. A year later, he was alongside Lana Turner - proper Tinsel Town royalty - in the film Another Time, Another Place. Her boyfriend, the mobster Johnny Stompanato, reacted badly to rumours of a romance. He stormed on set and pulled out a gun. Connery grabbed it from his hand and overpowered him, before others stepped in and kicked him off set. He was praised for his role in the BBC drama, Blood Money And then came Bond. Producers Cubby Broccoli and Harry Saltzman had acquired the rights to film Ian Fleming's novels and were looking for an actor to portray 007. Richard Burton, Cary Grant and Rex Harrison were all considered, even Lord Lucan and the BBC's Peter Snow. It was Broccoli's wife, Dana, who persuaded her husband that Connery had the magnetism and sexual chemistry for the part. That view was not originally shared by Bond's creator, Ian Fleming. ""I'm looking for Commander Bond and not an overgrown stuntman,"" he insisted. But Broccoli was right, and Fleming was wrong. The author quickly changed his mind when he saw him on screen. He even wrote a half-Scottish history for the character in some of his later works. James Bond actor Sir Sean Connery dies aged 90 In pictures: Sir Sean Connery A director friend, Terence Young, took Connery under his wing, taking him to expensive restaurants and casinos; teaching him how to carry himself, so the slightly gauche Scot would pass as a suave and sophisticated secret agent. Connery made the character his own, blending ruthlessness with sardonic wit. Many critics didn't like it and some of the reviews were scathing. But the public did not agree. The action scenes, sex and exotic locations were a winning formula. The first film, Dr No, made a pile of money at the box office. Even abroad it was hugely successful; with President Kennedy requesting a private screening at the White House. More outings swiftly followed - From Russia with Love (1963), Goldfinger (1964), Thunderball (1965) and You Only Live Twice (1967). It was exhausting and occasionally dangerous.  At one point, he was thrown into a pool full of sharks with only a flexi-glass screen for protection.  When one of the creatures got through, Connery beat the hastiest of retreats. There was other work, including Alfred Hitchcock's Marnie, and The Hill, a drama about a wartime British Army prison in North Africa. By the time of Goldfinger he was beginning to resent the publicity the role brought But by the time You Only Live Twice was completed, Connery was tiring of Bond and feared being typecast. He turned down On Her Majesty's Secret Service, with the role given to Australian actor George Lazenby, whose career never recovered. Saltzman and Broccoli lured Connery back for Diamonds Are Forever in 1971, meeting the actor's demand for a then record $1.25m fee. Connery used it to set up the Scottish International Education Trust, supporting the careers of up-and-coming Scottish artists. The film had mixed reviews, with some critics complaining the film relied too much on camp humour, a theme that would continue and develop under his successor, Roger Moore. Connery starred in the Rudyard Kipling tale The Man Who Would Be King alongside his great friend Michael Caine, but most of the next decade was spent in supporting roles, such as in Time Bandits, or as part of an ensemble cast in films like A Bridge Too Far. Having lost a lot of money in a Spanish land deal, he accepted a lucrative offer to play Bond again, in Never Say Never Again. This time 007 was an ageing hero; older, wiser and self-deprecating but ultimately still as hard as nails. The title was suggested by Connery's wife, who reminded her husband he had vowed ""never to play Bond again"". He continued to play other parts, winning a Bafta for his performance as William of Baskerville in Umberto Eco's The Name of the Rose. Films like The Name of the Rose helped him escape the mantle of Bond A year later, his performance as a world-weary Irish beat cop, albeit with a definite Scottish accent, in The Untouchables, won him an Oscar for best supporting actor. In Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, he played Harrison Ford's father, despite being only 12 years older. And there was a knowing nod towards James Bond alongside Nicolas Cage in The Rock, where he was a British secret agent kept imprisoned for decades. There was box office success for The Hunt for Red October, The Russia House and Entrapment; although First Knight and The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen failed to take off. And he turned down the role of Gandalf in The Lord of the Rings in 2006, declaring himself tired of acting and sick of the ""idiots now making films in Hollywood"". He was briefly considered for the role of the gamekeeper in the 2012 Bond film Skyfall, but the director, Sam Mendes, wisely felt it would be distracting to have a previous 007 appear with Daniel Craig. Always hating the Hollywood lifestyle, he preferred to play golf at his homes in Spain, Portugal and the Caribbean with his second wife, Micheline Roqubrune, an artist he had met in Morocco. His previous marriage, to the Australian actress Diane Cilento, had ended in 1975 amid allegations he had been violent towards her and had a string of affairs. They had one son, the actor Jason Connery. He claimed he remained true to his Scottish roots despite living abroad Despite his exile, he retained a full throated passion for Scotland, despite once misguidedly endorsing a Japanese blend of whisky. He attributed his short fuse and his ""moodiness"" to his Celtic genes. ""My view is that to get anywhere in life you have to be anti-social,'' he once said. ""Otherwise you'll end up being devoured."" A long overdue knighthood, finally awarded in 2000, was reportedly held up by the Labour government because of his support for Scottish independence. In truth, his Bond is now a museum piece; the portrayal of women impossibly dated. The action scenes are still thrilling, but the sex too often bordered on the non-consensual. Thankfully, it's been a while since 007 slapped a woman on the backside and forced a kiss. But Connery's performance was of its time, enjoyed by millions of both sexes and gave the silver screen a 20th Century icon. He leaves behind him a body of work that any actor would be proud of and, not least, a vacancy for the title ""Greatest Living Scot"".

"Nicola Sturgeon said only essential journeys should be made across the border with England Nicola Sturgeon has told people not to travel to or from England except for ""essential purposes"". The first minister issued the appeal as Boris Johnson prepared to announce a month-long lockdown south of the border. Ms Sturgeon said her government would ""take account"" of the developments but would base decisions on Scottish measures on circumstances in Scotland. She said there were early signs existing action was having an impact. PM announces month-long England lockdown Boris Johnson has announced the closure of non-essential shops and hospitality, although schools and universities will remain open. It followedscientific modelling which suggested the number of deaths in the UK could rise much higher than anticipated,possibly as high as 4,000 a day by mid December, without further action. Earlier on Saturday, as speculation about new restrictions mounted, Ms Sturgeon indicated that Scotland would continue with its regional tiered strategy for the time being. A newfive-level system of restrictions will come into force in Scotland on Monday,which will see travel restrictions imposed on many Scots. She tweeted: ""Prevalance of the virus is currently lower than in other parts of the UK and there are early signs that the tough restrictions in place since we moved quickly in late September have started to slow the rate of the increase"".

She urged people not to travel to or from areas in Scotland under level 3 restrictions and added: ""For now, we are asking people not to travel to or from England at all, except for essential purposes."" Ms Sturgeon said decisions on action beyond this would consider what financial support was available as a consequence of any new restrictions in England. Earlier public health expert Prof Linda Bauld warned the path of the pandemic in Scotland over the next fortnight would determine whether the country goes into lockdown. She told the BBC'sGood Morning Scotland: ""You can see from the figures in Scotland that the case numbers are levelling off. ""We are making progress. The question I would ask is the progress quick enough? Senior pupils to wear masks in class at level 3 and 4 What level has your area been put in? What are the new lockdown rules? On Saturday the Scottish government confirmed a further 1,101 positive cases and 24 deaths. Prof Bauld said these figures are a ""reflection of infection rates in September."" She told the programme significant action has already been taken in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Prof Bauld added: ""I think the big debate is 'Why is England dragging its feet?' That is essentially the issue."" Prof Linda Bauld said cases in Scotland are currently levelling off but the next fortnight will determine whether the country goes into lockdown Prof Bauld, of Edinburgh University, said: ""Along with the other devolved nations you can see from the latestONS data,externalthat Scotland is really in quite a different position from many parts of England so I would not assume that we are going to go the same way as England."" But looking ahead, Prof Bauld said: ""We need to continue to expect these infection rates to go up and I think that the government strategy in Scotland is to keep an eye on the situation over the next week or two. ""My feeling would be unless we see improvements, particularly in some parts of the central belt, we really, realistically, could be looking at level 4, which we want to avoid but would be necessary, essentially just to avoid these preventable deaths escalating even further."" She also cautioned that in order to get the R-number below one it is possible the existing measures will not be sufficient. The latest estimate for Scotland is that the R-number is between 1 and 1.3, a slight fall on the previous estimate. Prof Bauld said: ""If the trends go in the wrong direction again then I think everybody in the country recognises that more action will be taken."" Motherwell is one of the towns in Scotland's central belt which will be under level 3 restrictions from Monday The Scottish government has meanwhile launched a new campaign to warn the general public of the serious implications of ""twisting the rules"". It highlights how even small lapses in compliance have an impact not only on health, but the economy and wider society. Launching the campaign, Ms Sturgeon acknowledged the ""huge sacrifices"" that have been made since March. She added: ""I know that people are tired and frustrated, but at this critical point in the pandemic, I want to remind people that the decisions they make over the coming days and weeks have a real impact on not only themselves but others. ""Right now, we rely more than ever on public willingness to adhere to the measures in place."" Ms Sturgeon said the new new protection levels should enable communities to ""control outbreaks quickly and effectively and minimise transmission of the virus"".

Marcus Rashford's petition to get the government to change its mind has more than one million signatures Manchester United and England footballer Rashford has called on the government to provide free lunches during school holidays amid fears over family incomes during the coronavirus pandemic. His Parliamentary petitionsaid ""no child should be going hungry"". The UK government extended free school meals to eligible children during the Easter holidays earlier this year and, after a high-profile campaign by Rashford, did the same for the summer holiday. But last week,Conservative MPs rejected Labour's Opposition Day motionto further extend free school meals by 322 votes to 261, with five Tory MPs rebelling. The government said it had already introduced more effective measures to support families. Families and community groups on Teesside said the decision not to extend the vouchers across holidays needed to be reversed. The White Feather Project, which started in March, has been running two community shops in North Ormesby and Brambles Farm where people have been able to get food essentials by making a small donation. Mark Horkan, who runs the project, said people needed more help than ever before, adding: ""If it wasn't for the likes of Marcus Rashford the government would close the door. ""It's all right saying 'no child will go hungry' - they are. It proves it when we have to do this,"" he said. Children may be able to receive free school mealsif their parent or carer receives at least one of the following:,external Income Support Income-based Jobseeker's Allowance Income-related Employment and Support Allowance Support under Part VI of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 The guaranteed element of Pension Credit Child Tax Credit (provided you're not also entitled to Working Tax Credit and have an annual gross income of no more than Â£16,190) Working Tax Credit run-on - paid for 4 weeks after you stop qualifying for Working Tax Credit Universal Credit - if you apply on or after 1 April 2018 your household income must be less than Â£7,400 a year (after tax and not including any benefits you get) A Middlesbrough mother-of-two, who did not want to be named, said the shop in North Ormesby ""really helps"". ""My kids are 10 and 13, they eat me out of house and home basically"" she said. ""I'm on benefits. It's been extremely tough."" She said without extra help available, there was a risk her two children would go hungry. ""No kid should go hungry, regardless of their situation. It's absolutely terrible,"" she added. The Thornaby Hub in Stockton is run by community charity Little Sprouts The Thornaby Hub in Stockton hands out food twice a week and is run by wellbeing charity Little Sprouts. Debbie Fixter from the charity said the vouchers given to parents over the Easter holiday ""absolutely worked"". ""When people say they're just a sticking plasterâ¦ that's just wrong,"" she said. ""I know last week, four people sold their phones because they needed food. That's the reality of it. ""Everything is online or on the phone, we make an assumption that people have access to these things but they haven't."" The White Feather Project runs two community shops Amanda Bailey, director of the North East Child Poverty Commission, said: ""I don't think any parent chooses to be in a position where they struggle to feed their family, and I would challenge anyone to live on the income of someone below the poverty line, month after month, and experience the relentless stress this causes. ""Child poverty is not an unsolvable problem. While the North East has seen the steepest recent increase in rates of child poverty, it actually experienced the biggest reduction between 1999 and 2013, which shows it can be done."" Cabinet minister Brandon Lewis said: ""We've put the uplift into universal credit, just over Â£1,000 a year. ""But also very specifically we've put Â£63m into local authorities to support and help people in hardship... and a number of local authorities are using it to do exactly that. ""We've put that support in there and I think that's the right way to do it because the schools aren't open so it's making sure that the welfare system can put the support in, targeted where it's needed most.""

"This key document shows several UK daily death projections by different modellers, compared with the first wave. The black line represents the government's predicted ""reasonable worst-case scenario"" The PM will meet his cabinet later as he considers a month-long lockdown across England - in the hope that measures could be eased by Christmas. A new ""stay at home"" order could be announced on Monday, with schools, colleges and universities exempt. Documents seen by the BBC suggest the UK is on course for a much higher death toll than during the first wave unless further restrictions are introduced. Deaths could reach more than 4,000 a day, one of the models suggests. This figure is based on no policies being brought in to slow the spread of the disease, but most of the models peak at about 2,000 a day. Downing Street said Boris Johnson will chair a cabinet meeting at 13:30 GMT to discuss the government's coronavirus response. Are we heading back into a full lockdown? Covid spreading faster than 'worst-case scenario' Winter virus plans revealed in leaked Sage report At the height of the pandemic during the spring, deaths in the UK reached more than 1,000 a day. Infection rates are currently soaring across much of Europe, prompting new forms of lockdownin Belgium, France and Germany. Another document, a Cabinet Office analysis, shows projections for hospital capacity in England The papers, understood to be part of a presentation by the government's pandemic modelling group SPI-M shown to Boris Johnson, feature several different projections of the likely course of the disease. All models predict that hospitalisations are likely to peak in mid-December, with deaths rising until at least late December before falling from early January. And a separate document circulating in government - based on NHS England modelling from 28 October - warns that the NHS would be unable to accept any more patients by Christmas, even if the Nightingale hospitals are used and non-urgent procedures cancelled. The document warns that south-west England and the Midlands will be the first to run out of capacity, potentially within a fortnight. It feels like history is repeating itself. In March, the government was trying to slow rather than stop the virus. Then modelling said huge numbers of people would die andwe ended up in lockdown. A key difference this time is the government's science advisers called for a circuit-breaker six weeks ago. The price of delay is cases are higher and we have missed the boat for doing it at the same time as school holidays for extra impact. It means we may have to lockdown for longer. The spring lockdown did bring cases down. A lockdown now would be expected to do the same. There is an ambition to keep schools open, but there are growing doubts about secondarieswhere Covid cases are ""increasing steeply"",external. Deaths will continue to rise throughout a suggested November lockdown, but the hope is driving levels of the virus low enough would allow the struggling NHS Test and Trace programme to become effective again. The driving motivation here is saving lives and not overwhelming the NHS. There is no guarantee it will deliver a normal Christmas, too. These latest papers come afterofficial documents from the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) revealedthat Covid is spreading much faster in England than the predicted ""worst case"" scenario. This scenario had estimated85,000 deaths from Covid during winter. But in the Sage documents - dated 14 October and published on Friday - scientists estimated that, by mid-October, there were between 43,000 and 74,000 people being infected with coronavirus every day in England. Their report said: ""This is significantly above the profile of the reasonable worst-case scenario, where the number of daily infections in England remained between 12,000-13,000 throughout October."" Scientists advising the government have been arguingfor a short, planned lockdown- called a ""circuit-breaker"" - since 21 September, when there were around 5,000 confirmed cases a day. Earlier this month, the World Health Organization (WHO) saidlockdowns were ""not sustainable"",externaland should be ""limited in duration"" due to their ""severe economic, social and broader health impacts"". While the WHO acknowledged that during the pandemic ""there have been times when restrictions were necessary and there may be other times in the future"", it said lockdowns are ""best used to prepare for longer-term public health measures"". Labour's shadow business minister Lucy Powell told BBC Breakfast suggestions of a national lockdown had come ""too late"". She accused the government of ""dithering"" as she argued a circuit-breaker over half-term would have ""had most impact"" and ""saved more of the economy"". But UK Hospitality chief executive Kate Nicholls said a national lockdown would be ""absolutely devastating"" for her industry. She told the programme the sector would need ""significant additional help"", adding: ""There is no spare capacity in the tank to be able to fund a lockdown - even for three to four weeks."" Her concerns were echoed by Federation of Small Businesses chair Mike Cherry, who said another lockdown would be ""incredibly frustrating"" as small businesses and businesses across the UK had ""spend thousands"" in making sure their premises are safe for employees and customers. And Dr Adam Marshall, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, has called on the government to urgently set out ""a clear plan"" if ministers are planning another national lockdown - ""rather than allow business and market confidence to be further eroded by speculation"". A government source said that the country is at a ""crunch point"". No final decisions have yet been taken, and not all cabinet members have yet been consulted on the next steps. But it seems that Mr Johnson is likely to take the national action that he swore he would do everything to avoid. Read more here. Sage scientist Prof John Edmunds told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the only way to have a ""relatively safe"" Christmas is to take ""stringent"" action now to bring the incidence of the virus ""right down"". Asked if restrictions would have to be more severe than the circuit-breaker previously proposed by scientists, Prof Edmunds said ""putting off"" decisions only ""makes them more difficult"". ""If we are going to put the brakes on the epidemic now, then we're going to have to put the brakes on harder and longer to bring the cases down to what might be an acceptable level,"" he said. Fellow Sage member Prof Calum Semple told BBC Breakfast that a national lockdown, with full compliance, ""would see a dramatic fall in hospital admissions"" in four weeks' time. Prof Semple suggested there should be a review at four weeks and there could be a ""bit of easing around the festive activities"" but that a lockdown would give officials ""time to get test, trace and isolate processes really up to scratch"". The current estimate of the R number in the UK - the number of people each infected person passes the virus on to on average - is between 1.1 and 1.3, indicating that cases are still growing. On Friday, 274 deaths were announced, meaning that since the start of the pandemic 46,229 people have died within 28 days of a positive test.

"Lawrence Gainey said going to the gym was about more than keeping fit, and helped many with mental health Gyms and leisure centres must be classed as ""essential services"" to stop them being repeatedly closed during winter months, campaigners have warned. Wales' First Minister Mark Drakefordhas promised gyms and leisure centreswill be able to reopen on 9 November. But a group of more than 100 gym owners said they were prepared to break any future Covid lockdown laws without scientific proof they should shut. The Welsh Government would not comment on potential future closures. One gym owner said months of closure had already had a ""devastating"" impact on members' mental and physical health, and he feared what would happen if they were forced to close again during the winter. Gyms, leisure centres, swimming pools and fitness studios were among the last businesses allowed to reopen in Wales after being forced to close their doors at the end of March as part of the first lockdown. Last week, after being open for two months, they were closed again, alongside pubs, restaurants and non-essential shops, as a 17-day national""firebreak""lockdown began in a bid to curb the spread of coronavirus. Mr Drakeford warned action was needed and people must stay at home, because if cases continued to rise the NHS would not be able to cope and ""more people will die"". Obesity increases risks from Covid-19, experts say Jobs cut at Better Cardiff leisure centres due to pandemic Gyms and coronavirus: What are the facts? Some medical experts have saidgyms could help the virus to spread, as they are humid and confined spaces with people sharing equipment. Prof Jonathan Ball, expert in viruses at the University of Nottingham, said people exercising breathed quite deeply andcould potentially produce droplets which could infect other people, but added risk can be lowered through things like effective air-conditioning, regular cleaning, social distancing and hand sanitising. Public Health Wales, which has been analysing a rise in cases ahead of the firebreak lockdown, blamed the rise in cases on peopletalking indoors, saying the virus was spread via ""respiratory droplets"". The Welsh Gym Owner Collective, which represents more than 100 owners of independent gyms, said they were willing to do ""whatever it takes"" to stay open, and had been ready to break the law, if they had been banned from opening on 9 November. This video can not be played Swimmers and gym-goers had said they were ""glad to be back"" Group founder Lawrence Gainey said closing facilities had already had a ""devastating"" impact on members' mental and physical health. While people are allowed to exercise outside, alone or with their household during lockdown, Mr Gainey warned bad weather and shorter days would impact badly on people already struggling. Q&A: What can you do in Wales-wide lockdown? Mr Gainey, who owns Pro Fitness in Penarth, Vale of Glamorgan, said gyms and sport centres should be classed as essential during the pandemic, and must not be closed at ""10 minutes' notice"" as many relied on the routine. ""So many of our members have said it helps their mental health, it's not just about physical health, we are really relieving pressure on the NHS,"" he said. Rooms in his gym are also used to teach self-defence to young people in areas with high levels of knife crime, and Mr Gainey said he had elderly members who came to work out every day just to see another person. Gyms were shut in Wales for about five months during lockdown Mr Gainey said gyms had spent thousands making changes to keep members safe, with members having temperature checks before being allowed to enter, and only a ""few cases"" had been linked to facilities in Wales. ""If there is a national emergency [which results in another lockdown] and it is fundamental for all businesses to close, then we will not act irresponsibly,"" he said. ""But if the science does not support the action that the government is taking, then we will push back and refuse to close."" Anna Prince said her gym was a lifeline for many women, some whom used it to escape domestic violence At Hydrofitness Ladies Gym, in Barry, Vale of Glamorgan, Anna Prince said she was prepared to stay open ""no matter what"" for her members' wellbeing. Some of the members are survivors of domestic abuse, elderly or have medical conditions, and Ms Prince said the gym, where the motto is ""no men, no mirrors"", was a safe space where they could work out and spend time with friends. ""Some of these women come from really bad homes, it is a place where they can talk and help one another, and rebuild their confidence,"" she said. ""One lady is 82, she is fitter than most 20-year-olds I've seen. She cares for her husband and it helps her keep strong so she can lift him around the house, and she's worried she's going to lose that."" The 41-year-old, who only bought the gym last summer using money left to her by her mother when she died, said she had lost about 50% of her members during the last lockdown and was struggling to pay staff and bills. She said she had spent hundreds on cleaning and safety equipment, but had done extensive research and believed staying open was the best thing to keep her members safe. ""I do not care if I get fined, my ladies come first, if they need the gym it will be open,"" she said. This video can not be played Mark Drakeford said without acting now the NHS would not be able to look after the increasing number of seriously ill people Ahead of gyms reopening in August, the first minister said: ""We know that coronavirus thrives in noisy places where people are expelling air, where it's hot and it's sweaty."" On 23 September all but essential services, including supermarkets, were closed as Wales entered a 17-day national lockdown, with people being told to stay home and only have contact with those in their household. But research by the gyms' trade body UK Active claims the number of cases linked to gyms is low, with 156 cases linked to more than five million visits between 5 and 11 October. And a petition to the Senedd calling on gyms to be classed as essential should another lockdown take place, has had more than 20,000 signatures. Earlier this week Health Minister Vaughan Gething recognised that the firebreak lockdown was ""tough"" for many people, including businesses, but urged people to abide by the rules to save lives. A report by the Technical Advisory Cell (TAC), which advises Welsh ministers on coronavirus, has warned ""multiple"" firebreaks""might be necessary to maintain low levels of incidence"" of the virus. Under coronavirus regulations businesses which refuse to close during any lockdown are committing an offence,and can face an unlimited fine,external. The Welsh Government was asked for its response to gym owners' statements regarding potentially breaking rules, but refused to comment, saying no further firebreak lockdowns were planned. A spokesman said gyms and leisure centres would reopen on 9 November alongside non-essential shops and other services. ""We are facing a public health emergency in Wales - coronavirus is spreading in every part of Wales and there is a real risk the NHS will become overwhelmed if we do not take action now,"" he said. ""We need to all work together and do everything we can to bring it back under control. The firebreak is designed to do just that.""
