"There is ""no gender bias"" regarding pay decisions at the BBC, according to a new report into the corporation. But the BBC's approach to setting pay in general ""has been far from perfect"", auditors PwC found. Their report,external, published on Tuesday, found a 6.8% gender pay gap among on-air staff. Responding to the report, the BBC said there would be ""substantial"" pay cuts for some men, and pay rises for some men and women. Director general Tony Hall said ""important issues"" had to be tackled. How the BBC gender pay story has unfolded BBC women faced 'veiled threats' over pay BBC women's pay gap stories Unlike the corporation's annual report, which was published last summer andnamed on-air staff earning more than Â£150,000, Tuesday's report involves those on air across all pay brackets - a total of 824 people. The 6.8% pay gap identified in this group was lower than the overall BBC average pay gap of 9.3%. The national average is 18%. Tony Hall spoke to BBC staff on Tuesday morning The director general said: ""Today's report does not find evidence of gender bias in decision-making. ""But it shows we have real and important issues to tackle... and I'm determined to get it right."" He added: ""The plans we're setting out today go further and are more important steps in modernising the BBC and making it fairer. ""We've already made an important start. We're addressing unfairness in individuals' pay and want to close the gender pay gap and have women in half of our on-air roles by 2020. Those are big, bold commitments I'm really serious about."" Lord Hall also said he wanted to ""push forward on our goal of getting 50:50 men and women on air by 2020, I now want to do that quicker"". Men working for the BBC earn an average of 9.3% more than women, a report found The median pay gap in the lowest three of the four on-air job levels PwC examined was 12.6% - higher than the BBC's overall pay gap of 9.3%. In the top level, the gap was 0.4% - but the number of people in this bracket was smaller and the range of salaries much wider. This level includes ""a small number of individuals, mainly men, [who] are paid very highly"". The ""most significant under-representation"" of women is found in news correspondent jobs. ""Slightly"" more women receive pay at the lower end of the salary range for their jobs, while more men are higher up the salary scales. But, referring to such disparities in the first three job levels, PwC said there are ""logical and non-gender related reasons"" for the differences. The BBC said it would take five actions: On air, there will be substantial pay cuts for some men, and pay rises for some men and women. A new framework for determining the pay of people on air will be introduced, to match that already created for the rest of BBC staff. Everyone will be able to see the pay range for virtually every job in the BBC. Where there are more than 20 people in a job, staff will also be able to see where everyone else is positioned. The BBC will review the progression of women in the corporation, looking at working practices and support for women returning to work. The BBC will accelerate progress towards equal representation of men and women at all levels on air, and also towards closing the gender pay gap by 2020. This video can not be played It is ""uncomfortable and painful"" at the BBC at the moment, says Fran Unsworth Before the report was published, BBC Women - a group that represents female BBC journalists and producers - said it had ""no confidence"" in the PwC review. The group said it had not been consulted and felt it had ""been excluded from the process"". However, it is understood the BBC will now consult staff about the report's recommendations before deciding whether to adopt them. More than 150 women haveput forward written evidence,externalto the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee, ahead of a hearing on Wednesday. The evidence includes claims that women at the corporation had faced ""veiled threats"" while trying to raise the subject of equal pay. Responding to the claims, BBC head of news Fran Unsworth said: ""If there have been veiled threats, I don't know how much of this is current, and I would really hope it isn't, and how much of that dossier is historic. ""But if any of that is current, then it needs to be raised."" Jane Garvey presents BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour Jane Garvey, presenter and member of BBC Women, told Radio 4's The World At One she was sceptical about the findings of the PwC report - namely that there was no gender bias around BBC pay decisions. ""The report would say that, wouldn't it? This is a PwC report commissioned by the BBC and, without being overly cynical, I might venture to suggest that the PwC has delivered the report the BBC has asked for,"" she said. She added: ""This was never about cutting men's pay - it's not a solution to the issue of equal pay."" Former BBC chairman Lord Grade, told the BBC the pay issue was a ""huge problem for management"" that would not be solved overnight. ""I feel sorry for the management but I think they're on the right track,"" he said. ""I think the levels of pay for the star journalists are way too high, there isn't really a market (in news)â¦ I think those levels will start to come down. ""(With entertainment), in my experience, people do work for less at the BBC in the entertainment world than they could get from ITV or C4 or Sky or somewhere else."" The report about on-air pay takes place against the backdrop of a long-running debate about gender pay at the BBC, which began last summer after the corporation published its salaries for on-air staff earning more than Â£150,000. Last week, six of the BBC's leading male presenters- Huw Edwards, Nicky Campbell, John Humphrys, Jon Sopel, Nick Robinson and Jeremy Vine - agreed to take pay cuts. A report published in October found men working for the BBC earn an average of 9.3% more than women. The figure covered all staff, on and off air, and was put down to the fact there are more men in senior jobs. Lord Hall said it showed the BBC was ""in a better place than many organisations"". Men working for the BBC earn an average of 9.3% more than women, a report found There is frustration at senior levels of the BBC that other organisations who are obliged to publish their own gender pay gap seem to be dragging their heels. The feeling at the top of the corporation is that they have gone much further than most other institutions on both gender pay across the organisation, and equal pay for equal staff. In his five-point plan to staff today, the director general argued for radical levels of transparency. This is somewhat ironic, given he vigorously resisted the salary disclosures last summer. Taken in concert, these issues show the BBC has a plan to tackle current injustices, and Lord Hall has certainly done more than his predecessors to advance female talent both on and off air. But history casts a long shadow over today's report. For many of the women at the BBC I have spoken to, the feeling is that they have accumulated injustice - and, some would argue, discrimination - over the course of their careers. Such is the strength of feeling that these proposals don't mark the end of this issue for the BBC - merely the end of the beginning.

"Paddy Jackson (left) and Stuart Olding arriving at court on Tuesday A court has been told that Ulster rugby players Paddy Jackson and Stuart Olding both raped a 19-year-old woman after a night out at a Belfast nightclub. The players, who both deny the charges, are on trial at Belfast Crown Court. Mr Jackson, 26, from Belfast's Oakleigh Park, is charged with one count of rape and one count of sexual assault. Mr Olding, 24, from Ardenlee Street, Belfast, is also charged with rape. Two other men have also been charged in connection with the case. Blane McIlroy, 26, of Royal Lodge Road, Belfast, is charged with one count of exposure while Rory Harrison, 25, of Manse Road, Belfast is charged with perverting the course of justice and withholding information. Both deny the charges. Prosecutors opened the trial with a description of the alleged events in Paddy Jackson's Belfast home. The court was told that the woman at the centre of the case went to a nightclub in Belfast with a group of friends on 27 June 2016. Blane McIlroy (left) and Rory Harrison both deny the charges against them The court heard that they went to a VIP section where some Ulster rugby players were present. The prosecution said the woman went back to Mr Jackson's house at Oakleigh Park with three other young women, who she did not know personally but who were mutual friends of a close friend. According to the prosecution, she ended up in Mr Jackson's upstairs bedroom ""consensually kissing him"" but made it clear that she did not want to go any further. She then went downstairs but later realised she had left her clutch bag upstairs and claims that Mr Jackson followed her when she went to retrieve it. The prosecution said that Mr Jackson then ""pushed her onto the bed before pulling her trousers and pants down"" before raping her. ""He had not in any way sought her consent and indeed had used force to achieve his aim,"" a prosecuting lawyer said. The prosecution told the court that the woman did not attempt to fight him off but felt ""numb"" throughout what happened. The court was then told that, while this was happening, Stuart Olding entered the room and that she said to Mr Jackson: ""Please, not him as well."" The prosecution said that Mr Olding positioned himself on the bed in front of her face and forced himself on her. While this was happening, prosecution said that one of the three other women who were in the house came into the bedroom and that Mr Jackson asked her if she would like to join in. The woman left and, according to the prosecution, Mr Jackson continued to attack the 19-year-old and ""caused her considerable pain"". The prosecution also outlined the case against Mr McIlroy and Mr Harrison. The prosecution added that Mr McIlroy sent Paddy Jackson a text that asked: ""Is there a possibility of a threesome."" Paddy Jackson and Stuart Olding have both been capped for Ireland The court also heard that he later entered the bedroom naked and asked for sex, to which the woman replied: ""How many times does it take for a girl to say 'no' before it sinks in?"" The woman then got dressed and left the bedroom. The prosecution said that Mr Harrison was ""ostensibly concerned for her welfare"" and offered to share a taxi home with her in the early hours of the morning. However, the prosecutor added that Mr Harrison ""sought to cover up what he realised had happened and tried to mislead the police enquiry that followed"". Later that day, Mr Harrison sent the woman a WhatsApp message to check if she was okay. The court was told that she replied: ""To be honest, no. I know you must be mates with those guys but I don't like them. And what happened was not consensual which is why I was so upset."" At around 09:00 BST that morning, the prosecution said she texted a close friend and said: ""I got raped by three Ulster fucking rugby scum."" She then texted another friend with the message: ""I got raped."" Asked if there was more than one person involved, she said: ""Two and then a third tried to get involved... I was crying... there was a really nice guy there who took me home."" When told by a friend she should go to the police, the court heard that she replied: ""I am not going to the police. Going up against Ulster rugby. Yeah because that'll work."" The court then heard that a friend persuaded her to go to The Rowan, a sexual assault referral centre in Antrim. The prosecution said that a doctor who examined her found she had bruising and bleeding. ""These findings would be consistent with blunt trauma to the area but do not demonstrate whether the intercourse was consensual or not,"" the prosecution added. The woman went to the police the next day, 29 June 2016. The court heard that the taxi driver who took her home on the night in question described her as being ""very upset"" and added: ""It was obvious she had had a really rough night."" According to the prosecution, the day after the alleged attack, Stuart Olding sent an explicit WhatsApp message to a group of friends boasting about the events of the night. One of his messages said: ""It was like a merry-go-round at a carnival."" The court heard that Rory Harrison later texted Blaine McIlroy and told him: ""Mate, no joke, she was in hysterics. Wasn't going to end well."" Mr Jackson was arrested on 30 June 2016. In a statement, he said: ""I strenuously deny these allegations. I am shocked and horrified that these allegations have been made against me."" Mr Olding and Mr McIlroy were also arrested on that date. They too denied the charges. Mr Harrison was originally treated as a witness but the prosecution said there were ""shortcomings"" in his account. He was interviewed under caution in October 2016 and later charged with perverting the course of justice and withholding information. He denies the charges. The judge warned the 12-person jury not to come to any conclusions on the case until they had heard all the evidence. The trial continues.

"The vault at Hatton Garden Safe Deposit Ltd was breached over the 2015 Easter weekend The four ringleaders behind the Hatton Garden raid must pay a total of Â£27.5m or serve another seven years in jail. John ""Kenny"" Collins, 77, Daniel Jones, 63, Terry Perkins, 69, and Brian Reader, 78, were ordered to pay the money back during a confiscation ruling at Woolwich Crown Court. The gang stole goods after drilling a hole in the wall of a vault at Hatton Garden Safe Deposit in Easter 2015. The raid has been branded the ""largest burglary in English legal history"". It is thought two thirds of the valuables remain unrecovered. Who were the jewellery heist raiders? Gang sentenced for Hatton Garden raid Judge Christopher Kinch QC said the men jointly benefitted from an estimated Â£13.69m worth of stolen cash, gold and gems. The breakdown of the amounts ordered by the judge on Tuesday, based on the individuals' ""available assets"", are: John Collins, of Islington, north London - Â£7,686,039 Daniel Jones, of Enfield, north London - Â£6,649,827 Terry Perkins, of Enfield - Â£6,526,571 Brian Reader, of Dartford, Kent - Â£6,644,951, including the sale of his Â£639,800 home and development land worth Â£533,000 Handing down his ruling, the judge said: ""A number of these defendants are not only of a certain age, but have in some cases serious health problems. ""But as a matter of principle and policy it is very difficult to endorse any approach that there is a particular treatment for someone who chooses to go out and commit offences at the advanced stage of their lives that some of these defendants were."" Clockwise from top left Brian Reader, John Collins, Daniel Jones and Terry Perkins were described as the ringleaders of the heist Collins, Jones, and Perkins pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit burglaryand were each jailed for seven years in 2016. Reader, who was too ill to attend the initial sentencing, was later jailed for six years and three months. Tom Wainwright, representing Reader, said an increase in his sentence ""does not have to be very long for it to mean, in reality, he will serve the rest of his life in custody"". The barristers for Jones and Perkins said their clients would have to serve the default sentence as neither will be able to raise the funds. Carl Wood and William ""Billy the fish"" Lincoln, 60, of Bethnal Green, east London, were given six and seven-year sentences respectively for the same offence as the rest of the gang, as well as one count of conspiracy to conceal, convert or transfer criminal property. Wood, 60, of Cheshunt, Hertfordshire,has already ordered to pay more than Â£50,000. Plumber Hugh Doyle, who helped the burglars, was ordered to pay Â£367.50 for his ""general criminal conduct"" at the court on Tuesday. Doyle, of Enfield, was convicted in 2016 of providing access to a yard where goods from the raid could be moved between vehicles. The judge said Doyle, 50, had not received any benefit, payment or reward for his participation in raid, but that he had been deemed to have benefitted Â£27,194.44 from the proceeds of a ""criminal lifestyle"". He said Doyle had ""limited assets"" and ordered him to pay the sum within 14 days.

"Brendan Cole was a professional dancer on Strictly Come Dancing for 13 years Brendan Cole has announced he will not be returning to Strictly Come Dancing. The professional dancer revealed during a TV interview on Tuesday that the decision was made by the BBC, saying he was ""in shock"". ""They made an editorial decision not to have me back on the show,"" he said on ITV's Lorraine. A spokesman for the BBC One show thanked Cole for ""being part of the show since the beginning"" and contributing to its success. Cole said: ""I'm a little bit in shock at the moment. ""I'm quite emotional and a bit raw about it. I am very disappointed. It's an editorial decision. I will never know the ins and outs. ""I have had 15 incredible series on the show, I'm very proud of the whole show, they're a great team."" This video can not be played In an interview on 16 January, Brendan Cole told 5 live he wanted to return to Strictly. Cole was one of the first professional dancers when the show launched in 2004, which was the year he won the contest with newsreader Natasha Kaplinsky. The 41-year-old also won his last Strictly competition - the 2017 Christmas special - with presenter Katie Derham. Anton Du Beke is now the only remaining original dancer on the show. Cole won the show with Natasha Kaplinsky in 2004 Cole, who is currently on tour with his musical show All Night Long, said the exit would give him time to work on other projects. He is also awaiting the birth of his second child with model Zoe Hobbs.

He was paired with Charlotte Hawkins for the 2017 series This included Jo Wood during the seventh series when judge Craig Revel Horwood compared her dancing to a ""bush kangaroo"". The most recent series saw him paired with Good Morning Britain presenter, Charlotte Hawkins. Cole defended Hawkins when the judges - especially head judge Shirley Ballas - made comments about her performance. The pair were eliminated in week four. ""I'm a very strong character within the show, I have my views and I love that side of the show,"" he told Lorraine. ""I have always said as long as I've got a passion for it, I want to be there.

"This video can not be played Liam Allan said he was ""disappointed"" with how his case was handled The Met has apologised to a student wrongly accused of rape for a series of errors in its handling of the case. A review found that a ""lack of knowledge"" by police and prosecutors was to blame for the botched prosecution against Liam Allan. The officer in charge of the case failed to find key evidence among 57,000 messages on the alleged victim's mobile phone, the report found. Mr Allan, 22, had been charged with 12 counts of rape and sexual assault. The case against Mr Allan at Croydon Crown Court was dropped after three days when the evidence on a computer disk containing 40,000 messages revealed the alleged victim had pestered him for ""casual sex"". Mr Allan, from Beckenham, in south-east London, had been under investigation for nearly two years before his trial collapsed. Mr Allan said he welcomed the recommendations made in the review but remained ""disappointed"" with the way his case was handled. He added: ""The report fails to address the true failures of this case."" The Met Police said the officer in charge of the case had asked to be moved to other duties, but has not been disciplined because there was no evidence of misconduct. The problems with disclosure in Mr Allan's case were caused by ""a combination of error, lack of challenge, and lack of knowledge"", a joint review by the Met and Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) found. The entire download of messages from the phone was not passed to the defence because the officer in the case said there was ""nothing relevant on it"", the review said. Liam Allan previously stated he felt 'betrayed' by the police and CPS. It is understood messages which later resulted in the collapse of the trial included some between the alleged victim and friends saying what a kind person Mr Allan was, how much she loved him and that she had had a great experience with him. There were also references to rape fantasies, Mr Allan's lawyer Simone Meerabux confirmed. The officer in the case admitted in an email included in the review that he had been mistaken in his belief that he looked through the whole download. Thousands of current rape and serious sexual assault cases in England and Wales are to be reviewedto ensure evidence has been disclosed. The Met said it had drafted in 120 officers to review 600 rape and sexual assault cases where a suspect has been charged to identify any similar problems. The Met said ""lessons would be learned"" from Liam Allan's collapsed rape trial Met Police Cdr Richard Smith and Claire Lindley, from the CPS, met face-to-face with Mr Allan on Monday to discuss the findings into the review. ""It is clear from our review that both the Met and the CPS did not carry out disclosure procedures properly in this case,"" Cdr Smith said. ""Although we are confident there was no malicious intent in this case, it was important that we carried out this urgent review and learn lessons from it."" Ms Lindley said Mr Allan's case had highlighted some ""systemic and deep-rooted issues"". She added: ""The prosecutors involved in this case did not sufficiently challenge the police about digital material. ""That meant that it took longer than was necessary to drop Mr Allan's case. For that, the CPS has offered an unreserved apology to him."" The Liam Allan case review sets out the errors which caused the late disclosure of evidence - but only hints at why police and prosecutors made the mistakes they did. The detective who failed to search properly for the alleged victim's phone messages suggested he may have been confused because he had so many phone downloads to analyse. It's thought the officer would have been responsible for over 20 cases, which Scotland Yard has acknowledged is too many. The force is short of specialist sexual offence investigators and has a high number of detective vacancies. The recommendations which accompany the review - for enhanced training, disclosure experts in the police and disclosure 'champions' in the CPS - indicate that in Liam Allen's case the issue simply wasn't seen as a priority, with those involved not adequately equipped or supervised.

"Mark Salling (pictured in 2011) starred in the television musical series Glee for six years US actor Mark Salling, known for his role in the TV series Glee, has been found dead near his Los Angeles home, his lawyer confirmed to the BBC. US media reports suggest he may have taken his own life. The 35-year-old was expected to get between four and seven years in prison after pleading guilty to possessing child sex abuse images. His sentencing was due on 7 March. Salling played footballer Noah ""Puck"" Puckerman on Glee from 2009 to 2015. He entered into a plea deal last October, avoiding a lengthier prison sentence of up to 20 years. He was arrested in 2015 after a tip-off that he was in possession of images of children being sexually abused. Investigators ultimately found tens of thousands of abuse images on his laptop and hard drive. Los Angeles police are yet to confirm Salling's cause of death Photographs in US media suggest the former television star's body was found in woodland near to where he lived in Sunland, Los Angeles. Salling's lawyer, Michael J Proctor, said in a statement: ""I can confirm that Mark Salling passed away early this morning. Mark was a gentle and loving person, a person of great creativity, who was doing his best to atone for some serious mistakes and errors of judgement. ""He is survived by his mother and father, and his brother. The Salling family appreciates the support they have been receiving and asks for their privacy to be respected."" His former co-stars have reacted to the news of his death. Allow Instagram content? This article contains content provided by Instagram.

"Hundreds of thousands of homeowners could be at risk of losing their homes by ignoring how they will pay off their mortgage, a regulator has warned. Nearly one in five mortgage-holders has an interest-only home loan, meaning they would need savings or other funds to pay a final lump sum. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said the end of these mortgage terms would peak in the next 10 to 14 years. Many borrowers were ignoring letters from lenders, it found. Interest-only deals allow borrowers to pay off the amount borrowed only when the mortgage term ends, usually after 25 years, but there is concern that a host of homeowners do not have plans in place to pay the final bill. The FCA said that 1.67 million full interest-only and part-capital repayment mortgages were still outstanding, representing 17.6% of all mortgages in the UK. One peak of these final bills has come in the past year or so, for those who took out endowment policies in the 1990s and 2000s. Less affluent, middle-aged homeowners who often converted to interest-only deals in 2003-09 - who are concentrated in the South West, East and North West of England, as well as London and the West Midlands - will see their final repayment demand come in 2027-28. The regulator said that lenders had improved their communications with customers at risk since its initial report on the issue five years ago. However, there were still concerns that some customers may have been incorrectly reassured about their plans by non-specialist staff. The FCA had more concerns over the reaction of borrowers who, for a variety of reasons, were ignoring letters from their lender. Some believed that they had an adequate repayment plan in place, while others were simply burying their head in the sand. Some had little trust in their lender, so were suspicious of the letters. The FCA urged these borrowers to talk to their lender as early as possible, otherwise they would restrict their options over time of paying off their mortgage. ""We are very concerned that a significant number of interest-only customers may not be able to repay the capital at the end of the mortgage and be at risk of losing their homes,"" said Jonathan Davidson, executive director of supervision at the FCA. Hannah Maundrell, from comparison service Money.co.uk, said: ""You may be able to remortgage your property, extend your mortgage to give you time to raise the money to pay it back or look into taking out another mortgage from a different lender. ""If you're at risk of losing your home, there are government schemes that could help. The key thing is to pick up that phone and talk to your lender."" Where can I afford to live?

"This video can not be played Chris Parker was interviewed by reporters in the aftermath of the attack A homeless man who stole from victims of the Manchester Arena bomb attack has been jailed. Chris Parker was hailed a hero after saying he helped, but CCTV showed him stealing from two victims and taking photos of others as they lay dying. The 33-year-old had previously admitted stealing a purse and a mobile phone. Jailing him for four years and three months at Manchester Crown Court, Judge David Hernandez told Parker: ""You were not the hero you pretended to be."" The judge added: ""You were just a common thief."" Parker pleaded guilty to two counts of theft and one of fraud after admitting using a debit card from the stolen purse. Judge Hernandez said: ""You stole from people who were seriously injured at a time when others were either dead or dying. ""It is hard to contemplate a more reprehensible set of circumstances."" The judge told Chris Parker it was ""hard to contemplate a more reprehensible set of circumstances"" Salman Abedi detonated a homemade bomb at an Ariana Grande concert at Manchester Arena on 22 May, killing 22 people and injuring many more. CCTV footage played in court showed Parker leaning over injured survivor Pauline Healey and taking her handbag to steal her purse, as her teenage granddaughter lay dying nearby. Hours later, Parker was using Mrs Healey's bank card at a local McDonald's restaurant. The court heard the footage also captured him taking photographs of the victims, including one of Mrs Healey. Prosecutor Louise Brandon showed the judge four pictures Parker took in the foyer which, she said, he later sold for Â£100. She said the CCTV footage shows Parker ""taking the opportunities that presented themselves to him to take photographs and to look for and, where possible, take valuable items, such as purses and mobile telephones from the bags of the victims"". ""As the tragedy unfolded around him, when the vast majority of those who were in the arena with him were trying to save lives and care for the injured and lost, the defendant was focused on seeking to take advantage of the situation,"" she added.

The prosecutor said the girl's phone rang a number of times as people tried to contact her, but Parker terminated one call with an automatic return text message which read: ""Sorry I can't talk right now."" In a victim personal statement, the girl's mother said the theft was ""yet another blow as to how despicable people could be"".

"Fred Scappaticci denies he was an Army agent within the IRA A man alleged to have been the Army's most high-ranking agent in the IRA has been arrested and is being questioned about allegations that he was involved in dozens of murders. The agent codenamed Stakeknife has been named as Fred Scappaticci from west Belfast. An investigation into his alleged activities, codenamed Operation Kenova, was launched in June 2016. The investigation team confirmed that a 72-year-old man had been arrested. The BBC understands the man being questioned is Fred Scappaticci and that he was arrested in Britain. The investigation team said the arrest was ""in connection with the investigation into allegations of murder, kidnap and torture"". A statement from the investigation team added: ""He is currently in custody at an undisclosed location and will be interviewed in relation to the investigation. No further details of the place of arrest or where he is being held will be released due to security reasons."" Fred Scappaticci is alleged to have been the most high-ranking British agent within the Provisional IRA, who was given the codename 'Stakeknife'. He was the grandson of an Italian immigrant who came to Northern Ireland in search of work. Mr Scappaticci left Northern Ireland when identified by the media as Stakeknife in 2003 He has admitted, in the past, to being a republican but denies claims that he was an IRA informer. He is believed to have led the IRA's internal security unit, known as 'the nutting squad', which was responsible for identifying and interrogating suspected informers. Mr Scappaticci left Northern Ireland when identified by the media as Stakeknife in 2003. Operation Kenova is being led by Chief Constable Jon Boutcher, from Bedfordshire Police. It is examining the activities of current and former police officers, members of the Army and MI5 and former members of the IRA. The operation involves a team of 48 detectives. A statement by Operation Kenova said it had so far spoken to more than 40 families and generated 1,500 lines of enquiry.

"Oligarch Roman Abramovich (l) and PM Dmitry Medvedev are on the list Russian President Vladimir Putin says a list of officials and businessmen close to the Kremlin published by the US has in effect targeted all Russian people. The list names 210 top Russians as part of a sanctions law aimed at punishing Moscow for meddling in the US election. However, the US stressed those named were not subject to new sanctions. Mr Putin said the list was an unfriendly act that complicated US-Russia ties but he said he did not want to escalate the situation. Mr Putin said Russia should instead be thinking about ""ourselves and the economy"". The list was also derided by a number of senior Russian officials who said it bore a strong resemblance to the Forbes magazine ranking of Russian billionaires. A US Treasury Department later told Buzzfeed thatan unclassified annex of the report had been derived from the magazine,external. The government was required to draw up the list after Congress passedthe Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (Caatsa),externalin August. The law aimed to punish Russia for its alleged meddling in the 2016 US presidential election and its actions in Ukraine. The Trump-Russia saga in 200 words Congress wanted the list to name and shame those who had benefited from close association with President Putin and put them on notice that they could be targeted for sanctions, or more sanctions, in the future. President Donald Trump did not support Caatsa, even though he signed it into law, saying it was ""unconstitutional"". Under the law, the list had to be delivered by Monday. The fact it was released about 10 minutes before midnight may reflect Mr Trump's coolness towards it, and his opposition to punishing more Russians with sanctions. The top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee,Eliot Engel, accused the Trump administration of letting ""Russia off the hook again"",externalby not taking substantial action. Informally known asthe ""Putin list"",external, the unclassified section has 210 names, 114 of them in the government or linked to it, or key businessmen. The other 96 are oligarchs apparently determined more by the fact they are worth more than $1bn (Â£710m) than their close ties to the Kremlin. Congress passed the law in August, although President Donald Trump had opposed it Most of Mr Putin's longstanding allies are named, many of themsiloviki(security guys). They include the spy chiefs Alexander Bortnikov of the Federal Security Service (FSB) - which Mr Putin used to run - and Sergei Naryshkin of the Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR). The men who control Russia's energy resources are listed: Gazprom chief Alexei Miller, Rosneft chief Igor Sechin and other oil and gas executives, along with top bankers like Bank Rossiya manager Yuri Kovalchuk. The oligarchs includeKirill Shamalov, who is reported to be Mr Putin's son-in-law,external, although the Kremlin has never confirmed his marriage to Katerina Tikhonova, nor even that she is the president's daughter. Internationally known oligarchs are there too, such as those with stakes in top English football clubs: Alisher Usmanov (Arsenal) and Roman Abramovich (Chelsea). Not at the moment. The US Treasury document itself stresses: ""It is not a sanctions list, and the inclusion of individuals or entities... does not and in no way should be interpreted to impose sanctions on those individuals or entities."" It adds: ""Neither does inclusion on the unclassified list indicate that the US government has information about the individual's involvement in malign activities."" However, there is a classified version said to include information detailing allegations of involvement in corrupt activities. Reality Check: What are the sanctions against Russia? Analysis: Steve Rosenberg, BBC Moscow correspondent The good news for the Kremlin: this isn't a sanctions list. But the good news ends there. Those Russian officials and oligarchs named by the US Treasury will worry that their inclusion could signal sanctions in the future. Even before the list was made public, the Kremlin had claimed the US Treasury report was an attempt to meddle in Russia's presidential election. The list reads like a Who's Who of the Russian political elite and business world. Moscow won't want that to become a Who's Sanctioned. Kremlin accuses US of election meddling The law limited the amount of money Americans could invest in Russian energy projects and made it more difficult for US companies to do business with Russia. It also imposed sanctions on Iran and North Korea. This video can not be played All you need to know about the Trump-Russia investigation In signing the act, Mr Trump attached a statement calling the measure ""deeply flawed"" and said he could make ""far better deals with foreign countries than Congress"". Earlier on Monday, the US government argued the Caatsa law had already pushed governments around the world to cancel deals with Russia worth billions, suggesting that more sanctions were not required. Perhaps referring to the fact that all of their political representatives had been named, Mr Putin said that, in effect, ""all 146 million Russians have been put on the list"". He joked he was offended not to be named himself. Earlier, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, who is himself on the list, accepted that it was not one of sanctions but said it could potentially damage ""the image and reputation"" of figures listed and their associated companies. He added: ""It's not the first day that we live with quite aggressive comments made towards us, so we should not give in to emotions."" When Caatsa was passed,PM Dmitry Medvedev said it meant the US had declared a ""full-scale trade war"" on Russia. Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny praised the publication of the names as ""a good list"".

The judge told Chris Parker it was ""hard to contemplate a more reprehensible set of circumstances"" Salman Abedi detonated a homemade bomb at an Ariana Grande concert at Manchester Arena on 22 May, killing 22 people and injuring many more. CCTV footage played in court showed Parker leaning over injured survivor Pauline Healey and taking her handbag to steal her purse, as her teenage granddaughter lay dying nearby. Hours later, Parker was using Mrs Healey's bank card at a local McDonald's restaurant. The court heard the footage also captured him taking photographs of the victims, including one of Mrs Healey. Prosecutor Louise Brandon showed the judge four pictures Parker took in the foyer which, she said, he later sold for Â£100. She said the CCTV footage shows Parker ""taking the opportunities that presented themselves to him to take photographs and to look for and, where possible, take valuable items, such as purses and mobile telephones from the bags of the victims"". ""As the tragedy unfolded around him, when the vast majority of those who were in the arena with him were trying to save lives and care for the injured and lost, the defendant was focused on seeking to take advantage of the situation,"" she added. Salman Abedi detonated a home-made bomb in the foyer of the arena on 22 May last year Parker also stole a mobile phone from a 14-year-old girl who was seriously hurt in the blast. Miss Brandon said the teenager had been holding it at the time of the explosion. Parker then picked it up, the court heard. The prosecutor said the girl's phone rang a number of times as people tried to contact her, but Parker terminated one call with an automatic return text message which read: ""Sorry I can't talk right now."" In a victim personal statement, the girl's mother said the theft was ""yet another blow as to how despicable people could be"". Supt Chris Hill, from Greater Manchester Police, said: ""No matter what personal circumstances you might find yourself in, to steal from injured and terrified innocent people is deplorable. ""Parker exploited these people when they were at their most vulnerable and needed the help of those around them."" The judge told Parker he will serve half his sentence in custody before being released on licence. He also banned him from Manchester city centre for 10 years. When the story of Parker's ""heroism"" was originally reported,an appeal on the crowdfunding website GoFundMe raised Â£52,000. A spokesman for GoFundMe said Parker did not receive the money and it has been returned to the donors. 'Hero' admits stealing from blast victims Manchester attack 'hero' admits theft.

"Oligarch Roman Abramovich (l) and PM Dmitry Medvedev are on the list Russian President Vladimir Putin says a list of officials and businessmen close to the Kremlin published by the US has in effect targeted all Russian people. The list names 210 top Russians as part of a sanctions law aimed at punishing Moscow for meddling in the US election. However, the US stressed those named were not subject to new sanctions. Mr Putin said the list was an unfriendly act that complicated US-Russia ties but he said he did not want to escalate the situation. Mr Putin said Russia should instead be thinking about ""ourselves and the economy"". The list was also derided by a number of senior Russian officials who said it bore a strong resemblance to the Forbes magazine ranking of Russian billionaires. A US Treasury Department later told Buzzfeed thatan unclassified annex of the report had been derived from the magazine,external. The government was required to draw up the list after Congress passedthe Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (Caatsa),externalin August. The law aimed to punish Russia for its alleged meddling in the 2016 US presidential election and its actions in Ukraine. The Trump-Russia saga in 200 words Congress wanted the list to name and shame those who had benefited from close association with President Putin and put them on notice that they could be targeted for sanctions, or more sanctions, in the future. President Donald Trump did not support Caatsa, even though he signed it into law, saying it was ""unconstitutional"". Under the law, the list had to be delivered by Monday. The fact it was released about 10 minutes before midnight may reflect Mr Trump's coolness towards it, and his opposition to punishing more Russians with sanctions. The top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee,Eliot Engel, accused the Trump administration of letting ""Russia off the hook again"",externalby not taking substantial action. Informally known asthe ""Putin list"",external, the unclassified section has 210 names, 114 of them in the government or linked to it, or key businessmen. The other 96 are oligarchs apparently determined more by the fact they are worth more than $1bn (Â£710m) than their close ties to the Kremlin. Congress passed the law in August, although President Donald Trump had opposed it Most of Mr Putin's longstanding allies are named, many of themsiloviki(security guys). They include the spy chiefs Alexander Bortnikov of the Federal Security Service (FSB) - which Mr Putin used to run - and Sergei Naryshkin of the Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR). The men who control Russia's energy resources are listed: Gazprom chief Alexei Miller, Rosneft chief Igor Sechin and other oil and gas executives, along with top bankers like Bank Rossiya manager Yuri Kovalchuk. The oligarchs includeKirill Shamalov, who is reported to be Mr Putin's son-in-law,external, although the Kremlin has never confirmed his marriage to Katerina Tikhonova, nor even that she is the president's daughter. Internationally known oligarchs are there too, such as those with stakes in top English football clubs: Alisher Usmanov (Arsenal) and Roman Abramovich (Chelsea). Not at the moment. The US Treasury document itself stresses: ""It is not a sanctions list, and the inclusion of individuals or entities... does not and in no way should be interpreted to impose sanctions on those individuals or entities."" It adds: ""Neither does inclusion on the unclassified list indicate that the US government has information about the individual's involvement in malign activities."" However, there is a classified version said to include information detailing allegations of involvement in corrupt activities. Reality Check: What are the sanctions against Russia? Analysis: Steve Rosenberg, BBC Moscow correspondent The good news for the Kremlin: this isn't a sanctions list. But the good news ends there. Those Russian officials and oligarchs named by the US Treasury will worry that their inclusion could signal sanctions in the future. Even before the list was made public, the Kremlin had claimed the US Treasury report was an attempt to meddle in Russia's presidential election. The list reads like a Who's Who of the Russian political elite and business world. Moscow won't want that to become a Who's Sanctioned. Kremlin accuses US of election meddling The law limited the amount of money Americans could invest in Russian energy projects and made it more difficult for US companies to do business with Russia. It also imposed sanctions on Iran and North Korea. This video can not be played All you need to know about the Trump-Russia investigation In signing the act, Mr Trump attached a statement calling the measure ""deeply flawed"" and said he could make ""far better deals with foreign countries than Congress"". Earlier on Monday, the US government argued the Caatsa law had already pushed governments around the world to cancel deals with Russia worth billions, suggesting that more sanctions were not required. Perhaps referring to the fact that all of their political representatives had been named, Mr Putin said that, in effect, ""all 146 million Russians have been put on the list"". He joked he was offended not to be named himself. Earlier, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, who is himself on the list, accepted that it was not one of sanctions but said it could potentially damage ""the image and reputation"" of figures listed and their associated companies. He added: ""It's not the first day that we live with quite aggressive comments made towards us, so we should not give in to emotions."" When Caatsa was passed,PM Dmitry Medvedev said it meant the US had declared a ""full-scale trade war"" on Russia. Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny praised the publication of the names as ""a good list"".

"Paul Golding (left) and Jayda Fransen (right) deny religiously-aggravated harassment A mother has told a court she blames the deputy leader of Britain First for her daughter's stillbirth. Kelli Best said she lost her child two days after Jayda Fransen shouted ""racist remarks"" through her letterbox. Folkestone Magistrates' Court heard Ms Fransen had been directing the comments at Ms Best's partner, a Muslim man due to face trial for rape. Ms Fransen and the leader of the far-right group, Paul Golding, both deny religiously-aggravated harassment. A video played in court showed her banging on the door of the Kent property and shouting: ""Come out and face me you disgusting rapist."" Live: More news from across the South East On the second day of their trial, the court heard how Ms Fransen went to the Ramsgate home of Tamin Rahmani, one of the defendants in the rape trial. His partner Kelli Best told how she was alone with their two children on 9 May last year. Giving evidence from behind a screen, she said: ""She was making racist remarks: 'Dirty Muslim rapist, come out, we're not going to leave until you're gone, come out. Dirty scumbags'. ""It was directed at Tamin because she thought he was in there but he wasn't. ""I was also pregnant at the time it happened, two days after I started to bleed heavily and lost my daughter, she was stillborn. ""I blame Jayda Fransen because there was no other reason for it to happen."" Ms Fransen, 31, and Mr Golding, 36, from Penge in south-east London, were arrested in May last year as part of an investigation into the distribution of leaflets and online videos. The clips were posted during a trial at Canterbury Crown Court where three Muslim men and a teenager were convicted of rape and jailed. Giving evidence on Tuesday, Ms Fransen denied she was racist. She said she had carried out campaigns against people accused of sex offences on a number of other occasions, but denied using the phrase ""Muslim bastards"", or saying that all Muslims are rapists. ""I've never said that and would never say that,"" she told the court. ""I think it's ridiculous, it's such a sweeping statement that I would never make."" Mr Golding told the court that he had often acted as Ms Fransen's cameraman. He said she edited and uploaded the footage, as well as designing and posting the leaflets. ""It was Jayda's campaign, she took ownership of it,"" he said. ""Jayda didn't abuse anyone. I don't believe what she did and what she said amounted to abuse."" Mr Golding said he has received ""death threats, physical attacks and regular confrontations"" as a result of his work with Britain First. The court was told Ms Fransen was previously convicted of racially aggravated harassment relating to an incident in Luton in January 2016 when she abused a woman wearing a hijab. Ms Fransen told her she ""had been hidden because your men can't control their urges"", with the victim later telling police Ms Fransen had also said ""you cover because you don't want to be raped"". The court was also told Mr Golding had a previous conviction for harassing a person in their home in January 2015. Prosecutor Madeleine Wolf said he told a woman living there that her son was a terrorist and that ""we want to evict him, we don't want him to live there"". The details of previous convictions were given during a prosecution bad character application which was denied by Judge Justin Barron. Ms Fransen is charged with four counts of causing religiously-aggravated harassment, while Mr Golding faces three counts. They have both denied the charges.

"This video can not be played Liam Allan said he was ""disappointed"" with how his case was handled The Met has apologised to a student wrongly accused of rape for a series of errors in its handling of the case. A review found that a ""lack of knowledge"" by police and prosecutors was to blame for the botched prosecution against Liam Allan. The officer in charge of the case failed to find key evidence among 57,000 messages on the alleged victim's mobile phone, the report found. Mr Allan, 22, had been charged with 12 counts of rape and sexual assault. The case against Mr Allan at Croydon Crown Court was dropped after three days when the evidence on a computer disk containing 40,000 messages revealed the alleged victim had pestered him for ""casual sex"". Mr Allan, from Beckenham, in south-east London, had been under investigation for nearly two years before his trial collapsed. Mr Allan said he welcomed the recommendations made in the review but remained ""disappointed"" with the way his case was handled. He added: ""The report fails to address the true failures of this case."" The Met Police said the officer in charge of the case had asked to be moved to other duties, but has not been disciplined because there was no evidence of misconduct. The problems with disclosure in Mr Allan's case were caused by ""a combination of error, lack of challenge, and lack of knowledge"", a joint review by the Met and Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) found. The entire download of messages from the phone was not passed to the defence because the officer in the case said there was ""nothing relevant on it"", the review said. Liam Allan previously stated he felt 'betrayed' by the police and CPS. It is understood messages which later resulted in the collapse of the trial included some between the alleged victim and friends saying what a kind person Mr Allan was, how much she loved him and that she had had a great experience with him. There were also references to rape fantasies, Mr Allan's lawyer Simone Meerabux confirmed. The officer in the case admitted in an email included in the review that he had been mistaken in his belief that he looked through the whole download. Thousands of current rape and serious sexual assault cases in England and Wales are to be reviewedto ensure evidence has been disclosed. The Met said it had drafted in 120 officers to review 600 rape and sexual assault cases where a suspect has been charged to identify any similar problems. The Met said ""lessons would be learned"" from Liam Allan's collapsed rape trial Met Police Cdr Richard Smith and Claire Lindley, from the CPS, met face-to-face with Mr Allan on Monday to discuss the findings into the review. ""It is clear from our review that both the Met and the CPS did not carry out disclosure procedures properly in this case,"" Cdr Smith said. ""Although we are confident there was no malicious intent in this case, it was important that we carried out this urgent review and learn lessons from it."" Ms Lindley said Mr Allan's case had highlighted some ""systemic and deep-rooted issues"". She added: ""The prosecutors involved in this case did not sufficiently challenge the police about digital material. ""That meant that it took longer than was necessary to drop Mr Allan's case. For that, the CPS has offered an unreserved apology to him."" The Liam Allan case review sets out the errors which caused the late disclosure of evidence - but only hints at why police and prosecutors made the mistakes they did. The detective who failed to search properly for the alleged victim's phone messages suggested he may have been confused because he had so many phone downloads to analyse. It's thought the officer would have been responsible for over 20 cases, which Scotland Yard has acknowledged is too many. The force is short of specialist sexual offence investigators and has a high number of detective vacancies. The recommendations which accompany the review - for enhanced training, disclosure experts in the police and disclosure 'champions' in the CPS - indicate that in Liam Allen's case the issue simply wasn't seen as a priority, with those involved not adequately equipped or supervised.

"Paddy Jackson (left) and Stuart Olding arriving at court on Tuesday A court has been told that Ulster rugby players Paddy Jackson and Stuart Olding both raped a 19-year-old woman after a night out at a Belfast nightclub. The players, who both deny the charges, are on trial at Belfast Crown Court. Mr Jackson, 26, from Belfast's Oakleigh Park, is charged with one count of rape and one count of sexual assault. Mr Olding, 24, from Ardenlee Street, Belfast, is also charged with rape. Two other men have also been charged in connection with the case. Blane McIlroy, 26, of Royal Lodge Road, Belfast, is charged with one count of exposure while Rory Harrison, 25, of Manse Road, Belfast is charged with perverting the course of justice and withholding information. Both deny the charges. Prosecutors opened the trial with a description of the alleged events in Paddy Jackson's Belfast home. The court was told that the woman at the centre of the case went to a nightclub in Belfast with a group of friends on 27 June 2016. Blane McIlroy (left) and Rory Harrison both deny the charges against them The court heard that they went to a VIP section where some Ulster rugby players were present. The prosecution said the woman went back to Mr Jackson's house at Oakleigh Park with three other young women, who she did not know personally but who were mutual friends of a close friend. According to the prosecution, she ended up in Mr Jackson's upstairs bedroom ""consensually kissing him"" but made it clear that she did not want to go any further. She then went downstairs but later realised she had left her clutch bag upstairs and claims that Mr Jackson followed her when she went to retrieve it. The prosecution said that Mr Jackson then ""pushed her onto the bed before pulling her trousers and pants down"" before raping her. ""He had not in any way sought her consent and indeed had used force to achieve his aim,"" a prosecuting lawyer said. The prosecution told the court that the woman did not attempt to fight him off but felt ""numb"" throughout what happened. The court was then told that, while this was happening, Stuart Olding entered the room and that she said to Mr Jackson: ""Please, not him as well."" The prosecution said that Mr Olding positioned himself on the bed in front of her face and forced himself on her. While this was happening, prosecution said that one of the three other women who were in the house came into the bedroom and that Mr Jackson asked her if she would like to join in. The woman left and, according to the prosecution, Mr Jackson continued to attack the 19-year-old and ""caused her considerable pain"". The prosecution also outlined the case against Mr McIlroy and Mr Harrison. The prosecution added that Mr McIlroy sent Paddy Jackson a text that asked: ""Is there a possibility of a threesome."" Paddy Jackson and Stuart Olding have both been capped for Ireland The court also heard that he later entered the bedroom naked and asked for sex, to which the woman replied: ""How many times does it take for a girl to say 'no' before it sinks in?"" The woman then got dressed and left the bedroom. The prosecution said that Mr Harrison was ""ostensibly concerned for her welfare"" and offered to share a taxi home with her in the early hours of the morning. However, the prosecutor added that Mr Harrison ""sought to cover up what he realised had happened and tried to mislead the police enquiry that followed"". Later that day, Mr Harrison sent the woman a WhatsApp message to check if she was okay. The court was told that she replied: ""To be honest, no. I know you must be mates with those guys but I don't like them. And what happened was not consensual which is why I was so upset."" At around 09:00 BST that morning, the prosecution said she texted a close friend and said: ""I got raped by three Ulster fucking rugby scum."" She then texted another friend with the message: ""I got raped."" Asked if there was more than one person involved, she said: ""Two and then a third tried to get involved... I was crying... there was a really nice guy there who took me home."" When told by a friend she should go to the police, the court heard that she replied: ""I am not going to the police. Going up against Ulster rugby. Yeah because that'll work."" The court then heard that a friend persuaded her to go to The Rowan, a sexual assault referral centre in Antrim. The prosecution said that a doctor who examined her found she had bruising and bleeding. ""These findings would be consistent with blunt trauma to the area but do not demonstrate whether the intercourse was consensual or not,"" the prosecution added. The woman went to the police the next day, 29 June 2016. The court heard that the taxi driver who took her home on the night in question described her as being ""very upset"" and added: ""It was obvious she had had a really rough night."" According to the prosecution, the day after the alleged attack, Stuart Olding sent an explicit WhatsApp message to a group of friends boasting about the events of the night. One of his messages said: ""It was like a merry-go-round at a carnival."" The court heard that Rory Harrison later texted Blaine McIlroy and told him: ""Mate, no joke, she was in hysterics. Wasn't going to end well."" Mr Jackson was arrested on 30 June 2016. In a statement, he said: ""I strenuously deny these allegations. I am shocked and horrified that these allegations have been made against me."" Mr Olding and Mr McIlroy were also arrested on that date. They too denied the charges. Mr Harrison was originally treated as a witness but the prosecution said there were ""shortcomings"" in his account. He was interviewed under caution in October 2016 and later charged with perverting the course of justice and withholding information. He denies the charges. The judge warned the 12-person jury not to come to any conclusions on the case until they had heard all the evidence. The trial continues.

"This video can not be played The duchess scored one goal, while the duke got two The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have gone head-to-head in a penalty shootout while learning about bandy hockey in Sweden's capital Stockholm. The duke scored two goals to the duchess's one after watching the 11-player game, played on a rink similar in size to a football pitch. They then went to the country's royal palace for a lunch hosted by the king, Carl XVI Gustaf. After their two-day visit to Sweden, they will travel to Norway. George and Charlotte join tour of Poland Duchess of Cambridge expecting third child Royal Family tree and line of succession Anna Widing, an international bandy player, coached the couple before the shootout.

The Duke and Duchess walked through Stockholm with Crown Princess Victoria and her husband Prince Daniel She said the duke had a strong shot and said she was impressed with the duchess. Ms Widing added: ""It was a privilege for us to show our sport to them."" Prince William and Catherine began their day with a hot drink from a flask carried in a case known as a bandy portfolj (bandy briefcase). The duchess, who is expecting the couple's third child, drank an alcohol-free version of the drink called glogg, which is usually mulled wine or coffee with alcohol. The Duchess of Cambridge met members of the public in Stortorget square At the king's lunch, the couple met the king and queen of Sweden and 15 other members of the royal court, including Crown Princess Victoria and her husband Prince Daniel. The princess and prince then joined the pair on a walk to Stockholm's oldest public square, Stortorget. After meeting members of the public on what is their first official visit to the Scandinavian country, the duke and duchess were then taken into the Nobel Museum for a tour. Hundreds of well-wishers turned out to see the royal couples They were given a gift by local Karin Wahlgren - a special glove for the couple to use to wipe their dog Lupo's paws when they got muddy. The duke and duchess also spoke to maths teacher Niklas Schild, who told Prince William that he was planning to travel to Windsor for Prince Harry's wedding in May. He said: ""William told me 'you'll be very welcome - it will be a very happy day'."" Catherine takes advantage of the Swedish design for a sit-down during their visit to ArkDes The game originated in Cambridgeshire and dates back to 1813. It is played outdoors on a sheet of ice the size of a football pitch - larger than an ice hockey rink - and with a ball not a puck. Like football, the game is played over 90 minutes. Under extraordinary circumstances such as heavy snowfall, the referee can choose to divide the match time in more than two parts. There are two teams, each consisting of 11 players.The full rules from the Federation of International Bandy are available online,external. It has become one of the most popular winter sports in Scandinavia, eastern Europe and the US. Sweden's women's team won this year's World Bandy Championships. The men's tournament finishes on 5 February. The couple then moved on to celebrate design at the launch of the UK-Sweden housing design exchange at the Swedish Centre for Architecture and Design or ArkDes. Ikea, whosefounder died earlier this week, was one of the companies represented at the event. The duke and duchess then revealed that they owned items of the firm's flatpack furniture, which were in Prince George and Princess Charlotte's rooms. Ikea's head of design Marcus Engman said: ""I'm proud that we can suit everybody."" Prince William then tested out his own chair as the duchess looked on The final event of the day was a black tie dinner at the residence of the British Ambassador. The couple met Swedish Prime Minister Stefan LÃ¶fven and his wife Ulla, with other guests expected to include Pirates Of The Caribbean and Thor actor Stellan Skarsgard and Ex Machina actress Alicia Vikander.

"This video can not be played Minister: There's a campaign to overturn Brexit vote The government says it will not publish a leaked report document predicting an economic hit from Brexit. Brexit Minister Steve Baker said the document was at a ""preliminary"" stage and releasing it in full could damage the UK's negotiations with the EU. According to BuzzFeed,,externalthe report said growth would be lower in each of three different Brexit outcomes than if the UK had stayed in the EU. Labour has called for it to be published and debated in Parliament. According to Buzzfeed, the leaked document, titled EU Exit Analysis - Cross Whitehall Briefing and drawn up for the Department for Exiting the EU, suggests almost every part of the economy would suffer. It looked at scenarios ranging from leaving with no deal to remaining within the EU single market. Kuenssberg: More Brexit trouble for May EU sets out Brexit transition demands Brexit: All you need to know Responding to an urgent question in the Commons, Mr Baker said the document was ""not anywhere near being approved by ministers"" and that ministers in his team had only just seen it. He described the document as a ""preliminary attempt to improve on the flawed analysis around the EU referendum"" and said it did not assess the government's preferred option of a bespoke free trade deal. It ""does not yet take account of the opportunities of leaving the EU"", he said, adding that civil service forecasts were ""always wrong, and wrong for good reasons"". Responding to calls for it to be published, Mr Baker said MPs would get as much information as possible before they vote on the final Brexit deal but said: ""We don't propose to go into these negotiations having revealed all of our thinking."" And as Brexiteer MPs hit out at the leaking of the document, he said there was ""clearly"" a campaign to overturn the 2016 EU referendum by some people in the media and the House of Commons. One Conservative MP, Antoinette Sandbach, told Mr Baker she took exception to being told it was not in the national interest for her to see the document. And responding for Labour, Brexit spokesman Sir Keir Starmer said the emergence of the report was ""piling absurdity on absurdity"" with the government having previously denied the existence of Brexit impact assessments. Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: ""For months, Theresa May's government have refused to produce any detailed analysis of the potential impact of various Brexit scenarios - now we know why they have so desperately engaged in a cover-up."" The BBC understands the Treasury contributed to the document but sources say it is part of a much wider range of work going on in Whitehall. May urged to 'see off hard Brexiteers' Reality Check: What the EU wants from transition talks The report suggests UK economic growth would be 8% lower than current forecasts, in 15 years' time, if the country left the bloc with no deal and reverted to World Trade Organisation rules. It says growth would be 5% lower if Britain negotiated a free trade deal and 2% lower even if the UK were to continue to adhere to the rules of the single market. All scenarios assume a new deal with the US. Conservative MP Philip Davies blamed the report on ""London-centric remoaners"" in the civil service ""who didn't want us to leave the European Union in the first place and put together some dodgy figures to back up their case"". Earlier Conservative MP and leave campaigner Iain Duncan Smith told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the document should be taken ""with a pinch of salt"" as almost every single forecast on Brexit has been wrong. A government source said the report ""contains a significant number of caveats and is hugely dependant on a wide range of assumptions"". The FDA, which represents senior civil servants, reacted angrily to Mr Baker's dismissal of the leaked study. ""We have just witnessed the extraordinary scene of a serving minister telling the House that, whatever analysis his own department comes up with, he simply won't believe it,"" said the union's general secretary Dave Penman. Liam Fox says some Tory colleagues must ""live with disappointment"" Meanwhile, International Trade Secretary Liam Fox has denied telling Tory Brexiteers to prepare for disappointment. Speakingto The Sun,externalabout pressure on Prime Minister Theresa May, he criticised Tory MPs involved with negative briefings, saying ""nothing that would happen would change the parliamentary arithmetic"". ""We don't have a working majority, other than with the support of the Democratic Unionists, and we need to accept the reality of that. I know that there are always disappointed individuals but they're going to have to live with disappointment."" Mr Fox told the BBC his warning was to Mrs May's critics that they will be ""disappointed"" in their efforts to topple her or secure cabinet positions for themselves.

"The man accused of driving a van into a crowd of people near a north London mosque had hoped to kill Jeremy Corbyn. Darren Osborne, 48, has denied he was behind the wheel during the attack on 19 June 2017, telling Woolwich Crown Court a ""guy called Dave"" was driving. He said they originally hired the van to kill the Labour leader on a march he was expected to attend. Mr Osborne also said that it ""would have been even better"" if London Mayor Sadiq Khan had been present. ""It would have been like winning the lottery,"" he added. Mr Osborne is accused of mowing down people in Finsbury Park, killing Makram Ali, 51, and injuring nine others. He denies charges of murder and attempted murder. Taking to the witness box, Mr Osborne said he met Dave at a pub in Treforest, South Wales, in early April or March last year, while he also met a man called Terry Jones, and that the trio discussed their political views. Mr Osborne said they initially planned to murder a Labour politician in Rochdale, before planning to target Mr Corbyn, believing he would be at the annual Al Quds march in London. He told the court he was alone in the van as he drove towards the march - but that ""road blocks"" in central London had ""thwarted their plans"". Later, he said he travelled to the Finsbury Park area, because ""it was Jeremy Corbyn's constituency"", where he met the others. Mr Osborne said they swapped drivers and he was ""in the footwell"" while Dave was driving, adding he had ""no idea"" where Dave went after the collision. He said the opportunity to attack the Labour leader would mean ""one less terrorist off our streets"". Asked if he had contact with Terry and Dave after the attack, Mr Osborne told the court they were planning to form a far-right group, adding: ""We were going to call ourselves the 'Taffia'."" Earlier, the court heard evidence on whether Mr Osborne acted with accomplices - namely two men, known only as ""Dave"" and ""Terry Jones"". Concluding the prosecution case, Jonathan Rees QC said Mr Osborne told the Metropolitan Police on the day of the attack that he was acting alone. Police footage appearing to show Mr Osborne in the back of a police van He read a statement from Det Con Paul Dring, who interviewed Mr Osborne as he was under armed guard at University College Hospital, on the day of the attack. During the interview, Mr Osborne told DC Dring: ""I'm flying solo"", the court heard. Mr Osborne is said to have spoken to officers after he was detained and told them he ""lost control"" of his van. The court was shown footage from the body camera of PC David Jones, who is said to have handcuffed Mr Osborne while he was on the ground after the incident. A man - who the prosecution says is Mr Osborne - can be heard saying: ""I lost control of the van"", and ""lost control, man"". Mr Jones then says: ""Were you driving, yeah?"" and the man is heard to reply: ""Yeah"". Asked if he had been drinking, the man said he had consumed a ""couple of pints"". Mr Osborne denies the murder of Mr Ali and attempted murder of ""persons at the junction of Seven Sisters Road and Whadcoat Street, London"". Mr Ali, from Haringey, had collapsed at the roadside shortly before being hit by the vehicle after leaving a prayer meeting.

"Theresa May met the Estonian PM after Tuesday's Cabinet meeting Theresa May didn't even manage to start her Cabinet meeting this morning, let alone get to the airport, before there was more trouble for the government over Brexit with the leak, and scoop for the website,Buzzfeed,,externalof some of the government's homework. The assessment that leaked suggests that under one of the potential scenarios, the economy would growmuch more slowly over the next fifteen years. But the real political significance is not the detail itself. There is nothing new about forecasts that show Brexit without a decent deal outside the EU will mean the UK is hypothetically less wealthy than it otherwise would be in the coming years. That was, after all, the whole substance of the Remain campaign that failed. It is also worth saying that over time Treasury, and many other economic forecasts, have been shown to be wrong time and again. It is inevitable that MPs will continue to demand the documents and all the workings of all the potential scenarios are published, particularly after the unfortunate fandango over the other analysis that either did, or didn't exist. (Remember those?) And it is more evidence for those campaigning for a relationship with the rest of the EU after Brexit that is, near as dammit, like the partnership we have right now. But, for conspiracy theorists out there, and sometimes in politics, it is worth indulging in that for a moment, the fact this kind of ""warning"" leaked, when Cabinet ministers are only being shown these slides individually, and not even allowed to take the documents, before a crunch Cabinet committee next week, suggests that someone with friends in high places is trying to quieten the voices of those calling for a more dramatic break. Until the prime minister makes her own particular preference known, both sides in this profound argument will endeavour to fill the space.

"This video can not be played Lords stake out positions on Brexit bill Britain cannot ""just muddle through"" Brexit, ex-minister Lord Bridges has said, warning that ""keeping every option open is no longer an option"". The Tory peer said ministers appeared unsure of what they wanted after leaving and the void was being filled by ""conflicting, confusing voices"". His warning came as a packed House of Lords started debating the government's crucial EU (Withdrawal) bill. It is aimed at ensuring a smooth transition when Brexit happens. The bill, which will also end the supremacy of EU law in the UK, has already cleared the Commons, but peers could now try to change it with nearly 190 of them requesting a say. Live updates: Lords debate EU bill EU bill 'fundamentally flawed' says Lords committee Some critics are angry about the powers it gives ministers to amend legislation without consulting Parliament. Opening the two-day debate, Lords Leader Baroness Evans said the measures were ""vital to a smooth and orderly exit from the EU"". She said the government understood concerns about ministers using ""delegated powers"" to make changes to some laws, but said this gave the government the ""discretion that this unique situation calls for"". Failing to ""correct deficiencies"" could cause disruption to the City of London, she said, adding that any major changes would be done using primary legislation. But Lord Bridges, who served in the Brexit department for about a year before leaving this summer, suggested the bill did not come close to answering the more fundamental question of what kind of country ministers envisaged building after Brexit. This video can not be played 'Taking your nervous aunts to Reservoir Dogs' ""Only once we have answered this question can we properly and fully answer the second question - what agreement do we want to strike with the European Union? ""What do we value more, parliamentary sovereignty and control, or market access and trade? ""Four months on, and there are still no clear answers to these basic, critical questions. All we hear, day after day, are conflicting, confusing voices."" Urging Theresa May ""not to indulge that very British habit of just muddling through"", he suggested the time was fast approaching when the prime minister would have to decide on a ""clear destination"" for Britain. ""As we face the biggest challenge this country has faced since the Second World War, keeping every option open is no longer an option."" In a series of impassioned contributions, former Tory cabinet minister and EU commissioner Lord Patten warned Brexit risked ""devouring his party"" and said while he accepted the outcome of the 2016 vote, he believed referendums were ""appalling and a sin against parliamentary democracy"". Former Labour transport secretary Lord Adonis called for the public to have the ""final say"" on the UK's exit in the form of another referendum. But House Of Cards author Lord Dobbs said talk by some peers of sabotaging Brexit was ""sad and unwise"". ""The ambition of this Bill is modest,"" he said. ""Simply to ensure continuity from day one. Very little will change. ""Yet I grant in these modest changes everything will change. We will bring back government closer to the people. We will once again make our own laws and be subject to our own courts. This video can not be played Former Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales, Lord Judge, warns of the dangers of handing over power to ministers after Brexit ""That's what the people have given their voice to and that is what we must enable through this bill in a timely manner."" The bill aims to transpose existing EU law on to the UK statute book so existing rules and regulations continue to apply as the UK leaves on 29 March 2019. On Monday the Lords Constitutional Committee said the bill needed to be reworked because it was ""fundamentally flawed"" and ""constitutionally unacceptable"". Another contentious part of the bill concerns devolution - and what happens to powers which are currently not reserved to Westminster, but which are exercised from Brussels. The UK government has been accused of a ""power grab"" by the Scottish and Welsh governments. It has promised amendments to address their concerns. As the bill started its passage through the Lords, Labour's Baroness Smith said it was time to move on from ""slick soundbites"" about Brexit to the ""nitty gritty of the detail"". Lord Newby, the leader of the Liberal Democrats in the Lords, said the Bill ""exhibits the arrogance and incompetence of the government in equal measure"".

"Fred Scappaticci denies he was an Army agent within the IRA A man alleged to have been the Army's most high-ranking agent in the IRA has been arrested and is being questioned about allegations that he was involved in dozens of murders. The agent codenamed Stakeknife has been named as Fred Scappaticci from west Belfast. An investigation into his alleged activities, codenamed Operation Kenova, was launched in June 2016. The investigation team confirmed that a 72-year-old man had been arrested. The BBC understands the man being questioned is Fred Scappaticci and that he was arrested in Britain. The investigation team said the arrest was ""in connection with the investigation into allegations of murder, kidnap and torture"". A statement from the investigation team added: ""He is currently in custody at an undisclosed location and will be interviewed in relation to the investigation. No further details of the place of arrest or where he is being held will be released due to security reasons."" Fred Scappaticci is alleged to have been the most high-ranking British agent within the Provisional IRA, who was given the codename 'Stakeknife'. He was the grandson of an Italian immigrant who came to Northern Ireland in search of work. Mr Scappaticci left Northern Ireland when identified by the media as Stakeknife in 2003 He has admitted, in the past, to being a republican but denies claims that he was an IRA informer. He is believed to have led the IRA's internal security unit, known as 'the nutting squad', which was responsible for identifying and interrogating suspected informers. Mr Scappaticci left Northern Ireland when identified by the media as Stakeknife in 2003. Operation Kenova is being led by Chief Constable Jon Boutcher, from Bedfordshire Police. It is examining the activities of current and former police officers, members of the Army and MI5 and former members of the IRA. The operation involves a team of 48 detectives. A statement by Operation Kenova said it had so far spoken to more than 40 families and generated 1,500 lines of enquiry.

"There is ""no gender bias"" regarding pay decisions at the BBC, according to a new report into the corporation. But the BBC's approach to setting pay in general ""has been far from perfect"", auditors PwC found. Their report,external, published on Tuesday, found a 6.8% gender pay gap among on-air staff. Responding to the report, the BBC said there would be ""substantial"" pay cuts for some men, and pay rises for some men and women. Director general Tony Hall said ""important issues"" had to be tackled. How the BBC gender pay story has unfolded BBC women faced 'veiled threats' over pay BBC women's pay gap stories Unlike the corporation's annual report, which was published last summer andnamed on-air staff earning more than Â£150,000, Tuesday's report involves those on air across all pay brackets - a total of 824 people. The 6.8% pay gap identified in this group was lower than the overall BBC average pay gap of 9.3%. The national average is 18%. Tony Hall spoke to BBC staff on Tuesday morning The director general said: ""Today's report does not find evidence of gender bias in decision-making. ""But it shows we have real and important issues to tackle... and I'm determined to get it right."" He added: ""The plans we're setting out today go further and are more important steps in modernising the BBC and making it fairer. ""We've already made an important start. We're addressing unfairness in individuals' pay and want to close the gender pay gap and have women in half of our on-air roles by 2020. Those are big, bold commitments I'm really serious about."" Lord Hall also said he wanted to ""push forward on our goal of getting 50:50 men and women on air by 2020, I now want to do that quicker"". Men working for the BBC earn an average of 9.3% more than women, a report found The median pay gap in the lowest three of the four on-air job levels PwC examined was 12.6% - higher than the BBC's overall pay gap of 9.3%. In the top level, the gap was 0.4% - but the number of people in this bracket was smaller and the range of salaries much wider. This level includes ""a small number of individuals, mainly men, [who] are paid very highly"". The ""most significant under-representation"" of women is found in news correspondent jobs. ""Slightly"" more women receive pay at the lower end of the salary range for their jobs, while more men are higher up the salary scales. But, referring to such disparities in the first three job levels, PwC said there are ""logical and non-gender related reasons"" for the differences. The BBC said it would take five actions: On air, there will be substantial pay cuts for some men, and pay rises for some men and women. A new framework for determining the pay of people on air will be introduced, to match that already created for the rest of BBC staff. Everyone will be able to see the pay range for virtually every job in the BBC. Where there are more than 20 people in a job, staff will also be able to see where everyone else is positioned. The BBC will review the progression of women in the corporation, looking at working practices and support for women returning to work. The BBC will accelerate progress towards equal representation of men and women at all levels on air, and also towards closing the gender pay gap by 2020. This video can not be played It is ""uncomfortable and painful"" at the BBC at the moment, says Fran Unsworth Before the report was published, BBC Women - a group that represents female BBC journalists and producers - said it had ""no confidence"" in the PwC review. The group said it had not been consulted and felt it had ""been excluded from the process"". However, it is understood the BBC will now consult staff about the report's recommendations before deciding whether to adopt them. More than 150 women haveput forward written evidence,externalto the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee, ahead of a hearing on Wednesday. The evidence includes claims that women at the corporation had faced ""veiled threats"" while trying to raise the subject of equal pay. Responding to the claims, BBC head of news Fran Unsworth said: ""If there have been veiled threats, I don't know how much of this is current, and I would really hope it isn't, and how much of that dossier is historic. ""But if any of that is current, then it needs to be raised."" Jane Garvey presents BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour Jane Garvey, presenter and member of BBC Women, told Radio 4's The World At One she was sceptical about the findings of the PwC report - namely that there was no gender bias around BBC pay decisions. ""The report would say that, wouldn't it? This is a PwC report commissioned by the BBC and, without being overly cynical, I might venture to suggest that the PwC has delivered the report the BBC has asked for,"" she said. She added: ""This was never about cutting men's pay - it's not a solution to the issue of equal pay."" Former BBC chairman Lord Grade, told the BBC the pay issue was a ""huge problem for management"" that would not be solved overnight. ""I feel sorry for the management but I think they're on the right track,"" he said. ""I think the levels of pay for the star journalists are way too high, there isn't really a market (in news)â¦ I think those levels will start to come down. ""(With entertainment), in my experience, people do work for less at the BBC in the entertainment world than they could get from ITV or C4 or Sky or somewhere else."" The report about on-air pay takes place against the backdrop of a long-running debate about gender pay at the BBC, which began last summer after the corporation published its salaries for on-air staff earning more than Â£150,000. Last week, six of the BBC's leading male presenters- Huw Edwards, Nicky Campbell, John Humphrys, Jon Sopel, Nick Robinson and Jeremy Vine - agreed to take pay cuts. A report published in October found men working for the BBC earn an average of 9.3% more than women. The figure covered all staff, on and off air, and was put down to the fact there are more men in senior jobs. Lord Hall said it showed the BBC was ""in a better place than many organisations"". Men working for the BBC earn an average of 9.3% more than women, a report found There is frustration at senior levels of the BBC that other organisations who are obliged to publish their own gender pay gap seem to be dragging their heels. The feeling at the top of the corporation is that they have gone much further than most other institutions on both gender pay across the organisation, and equal pay for equal staff. In his five-point plan to staff today, the director general argued for radical levels of transparency. This is somewhat ironic, given he vigorously resisted the salary disclosures last summer. Taken in concert, these issues show the BBC has a plan to tackle current injustices, and Lord Hall has certainly done more than his predecessors to advance female talent both on and off air. But history casts a long shadow over today's report. For many of the women at the BBC I have spoken to, the feeling is that they have accumulated injustice - and, some would argue, discrimination - over the course of their careers. Such is the strength of feeling that these proposals don't mark the end of this issue for the BBC - merely the end of the beginning.

"Studies question how good social media is for children's health More than 100 child health experts are urging Facebook to withdraw an app aimed at under-13s. In an open letter,externalto Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg, they call Messenger Kids an ""irresponsible"" attempt to encourage young children to use Facebook. Young children are not ready to have social media accounts, they say. Facebook says the app was designed with online safety experts in response to parental calls for more control over how their children used social media. It is a simplified, locked-down version of Facebook's Messenger app, requiring parental approval before use, and data generated from it is not used for advertising. The open letter says: ""Messenger Kids will likely be the first social media platform widely used by elementary school children [four- to -11-year-olds]. ""But a growing body of research demonstrates that excessive use of digital devices and social media is harmful to children and teens, making it very likely this new app will undermine children's healthy development. ""Younger children are simply not ready to have social media accounts. ""They are not old enough to navigate the complexities of online relationships, which often lead to misunderstandings and conflicts even among more mature users."" In response, Facebook said: ""Since we launched in December we've heard from parents around the country that Messenger Kids has helped them stay in touch with their children and has enabled their children to stay in touch with family members near and far. ""For example, we've heard stories of parents working night shifts being able to read bedtime stories to their children, and mums who travel for work getting daily updates from their kids while they're away."" The letter questions whether there is a need for Facebook to fulfil such a role, saying:  ""Talking to family and friends over long distances doesn't require a Messenger Kids account. ""Kids can use parents' Facebook, Skype, or other accounts to chat with relatives. They can also just pick up a phone."" There is a growing body of evidence suggesting links between social media use and depression in youngsters The letter cites a range of research linking teenagers' social media use with increased depression and anxiety. ""Adolescents who spend an hour a day chatting on social networks report less satisfaction with nearly every aspect of their lives. ""Eighth graders [13- to 14-year-olds] who use social media for six to nine hours per week are 47% more likely to report they are unhappy than their peers who use social media less often."" It also cites a study of 10- to -12-year-old girls who are ""more likely to idealise thinness, have concerns about their bodies, and to have dieted"". Other statistics, quoted from a range of different research, include: 78% of adolescents check their phones hourly 50% say they are addicted to their phones Half of parents say regulating screen time is a constant battle The experts also dispute Facebook's claims that Messenger Kids provides a safe alternative for children who have lied their way on to social media platforms, by pretending to be older than they are. ""The 11- and 12-year-olds who currently use Snapchat, Instagram, or Facebook are unlikely to switch to an app that is clearly designed for younger children. ""Messenger Kids is not responding to a need - it is creating one,"" the letter states. The letter is signed by a range of child welfare groups, chief among them the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood. Other signees included Massachusetts American Civil Liberties Union and Parents Across America. A host of individuals also signed, including British scientist Baroness Susan Greenfield. The UK government met social media companies and hardware manufacturers such as Apple in November 2017 and asked them to look at a series of issues - including: how to prevent under-age users from accessing their platforms what constituted cyber-bullying and how to address it whether it was feasible to create pop-up warnings for youngsters who spend a long time online Facebook: Now for young children too Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser Firefighters running out of water as wildfire declared most destructive in LA's history In maps: Thousands of acres on fire in LA 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Why does Trump want Greenland and what do its people think?

"This video can not be played Susan Morris suffered a broken jaw and other injuries during the raid on her home A highly professional burglar with a military background is behind a series of violent house raids across south-east England, police believe. Armed with a sawn-off shotgun, the man stakes out expensive Home Counties properties and has taken jewellery, watches and heirlooms worth about Â£1m. He knows the exact layout of the properties and location of safes by the time he strikes, Surrey Police say. Officers believe he may be ex-military and possesses ""specialist skills"". A police forces in Berkshire, Kent, Surrey and Sussex are investigating a series of raids between November 2014 and October 2017. Officers believe the burglar stakes out his targets for some time before launching an attack- a method which has led newspapers to dub him the Night Watcher. Det Insp Dee Fielding, who is leading the investigation, said the man strikes approximately every six months and is not ""an opportunist burglar"". ""This is absolutely not an amateur,"" she said. ""He stakes out these houses over a number of days, sometimes for a couple of weeks. We can see that on CCTV he is hiding in gardens - he's looking at houses to establish what the routines are of those within the premises."" ""The skills that he's using includes carrying a firearm. He uses cable-ties to tie up the occupants of the house. When he enters a house where he knows he is going to be outnumbered he still has the confidence and the ability to overpower those people. Whereas most people would need two hands to use a cable tie, Det Insp Fielding said, the suspect is able to tie people up using one hand even while they are struggling. ""We believe, based on this, that he may be ex-military or certainly has specialist skills from some sort of [similar] background."" 12 November 2014 - Kingswood, Surrey 21 January 2015 - Maidenhead area, Berkshire 13 January 2016 - Chichester area, Sussex 22 November 2016 - Sevenoaks area, Kent January 2017 - Maidstone area, Kent 24 April 2017 - Virginia Water area, Surrey 26 October 2017 - Kingswood, Surrey On each occasion, the man has used ""unnecessary levels of violence"", police said. One victim, Susan Morris, 61, said: ""He knew exactly how hard to hit me. He hit me three times on my face, it was very painful, I couldn't believe the blows kept coming."" Mrs Morris said during the raid at her home in Kingswood, Surrey, in October, the man pointed a gun in her back, hit her head against a wall and dragged her across the floor by her hair. All the while he kept demanding more jewellery. Susan Morris was found by her husband Stephen tied up with cables and hiding in a bedroom Mrs Morris said at one point she could not get a ring and bracelet off, and added: ""I actually thought 'he's going to cut my finger off'."" When her husband returned home from work, he found her still tied up with cables and hiding in a bedroom. Describing the man, she said: ""I would say he spoke well, he had no accent, he didn't have bad grammar, he's an intelligent man, he knows how to assess the situation and carry this out."" Police issued grainy CCTV stills of the man during an armed raid of a house in Maidenhead Police believe the man may be ex-military because of his levels of preparation and his ""well-spoken, intelligent"" language and manner but they have said he could be a current member of the armed forces or law enforcement. Officers say he operates alone, speaks little, threatens to kill people and their dogs and is ""incredibly decisive"". After DNA from the burglar was found at one crime scene, officers requested and were denied access to the Ministry of Defence's DNA database. The MoD said its DNA records were only shared with police if military personnel were under suspicion or convicted of a crime. A Ministry of Defence spokesperson said: ""We are working with the police in their investigation. ""We are unable to share DNA taken from personnel before they are deployed on military operations as it is restricted under data protection. ""If service personnel are convicted of a crime or are under suspicion, DNA records are shared with the police."" Surrey Police said the burglar focuses on jewellery Valuables worth more than Â£1m have been taken from each property Police say they are looking for a man who: Is white Has a stocky/muscular build Is about 6ft (1.8m) tall Speaks with a South of England accent Might be away from home regularly for extended periods of time Has income that is disproportionate to their job or means Has specialist knowledge and skills May seem to have money disproportionate to their job Might be travelling or away for long periods of time Surrey Police Firefighters running out of water as wildfire declared most destructive in LA's history In maps: Thousands of acres on fire in LA 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Why does Trump want Greenland and what do its people think?

"Paul Golding (left) and Jayda Fransen (right) deny religiously-aggravated harassment A mother has told a court she blames the deputy leader of Britain First for her daughter's stillbirth. Kelli Best said she lost her child two days after Jayda Fransen shouted ""racist remarks"" through her letterbox. Folkestone Magistrates' Court heard Ms Fransen had been directing the comments at Ms Best's partner, a Muslim man due to face trial for rape. Ms Fransen and the leader of the far-right group, Paul Golding, both deny religiously-aggravated harassment. A video played in court showed her banging on the door of the Kent property and shouting: ""Come out and face me you disgusting rapist."" Live: More news from across the South East On the second day of their trial, the court heard how Ms Fransen went to the Ramsgate home of Tamin Rahmani, one of the defendants in the rape trial. His partner Kelli Best told how she was alone with their two children on 9 May last year. Giving evidence from behind a screen, she said: ""She was making racist remarks: 'Dirty Muslim rapist, come out, we're not going to leave until you're gone, come out. Dirty scumbags'. ""It was directed at Tamin because she thought he was in there but he wasn't. ""I was also pregnant at the time it happened, two days after I started to bleed heavily and lost my daughter, she was stillborn. ""I blame Jayda Fransen because there was no other reason for it to happen."" Ms Fransen, 31, and Mr Golding, 36, from Penge in south-east London, were arrested in May last year as part of an investigation into the distribution of leaflets and online videos. The clips were posted during a trial at Canterbury Crown Court where three Muslim men and a teenager were convicted of rape and jailed. Giving evidence on Tuesday, Ms Fransen denied she was racist. She said she had carried out campaigns against people accused of sex offences on a number of other occasions, but denied using the phrase ""Muslim bastards"", or saying that all Muslims are rapists. ""I've never said that and would never say that,"" she told the court. ""I think it's ridiculous, it's such a sweeping statement that I would never make."" Mr Golding told the court that he had often acted as Ms Fransen's cameraman. He said she edited and uploaded the footage, as well as designing and posting the leaflets. ""It was Jayda's campaign, she took ownership of it,"" he said. ""Jayda didn't abuse anyone. I don't believe what she did and what she said amounted to abuse."" Mr Golding said he has received ""death threats, physical attacks and regular confrontations"" as a result of his work with Britain First. The court was told Ms Fransen was previously convicted of racially aggravated harassment relating to an incident in Luton in January 2016 when she abused a woman wearing a hijab. Ms Fransen told her she ""had been hidden because your men can't control their urges"", with the victim later telling police Ms Fransen had also said ""you cover because you don't want to be raped"". The court was also told Mr Golding had a previous conviction for harassing a person in their home in January 2015. Prosecutor Madeleine Wolf said he told a woman living there that her son was a terrorist and that ""we want to evict him, we don't want him to live there"". The details of previous convictions were given during a prosecution bad character application which was denied by Judge Justin Barron. Ms Fransen is charged with four counts of causing religiously-aggravated harassment, while Mr Golding faces three counts. They have both denied the charges. The judge will give his verdicts on 7 March.

"The mesh implants are used to ease incontinence and to support organs The government has agreed to carry out a full audit of how many women in England have suffered complications as a result of vaginal mesh implants. Women have long complained about the implants - which are used to hold up pelvic organs to treat incontinence and prolapse - causing agony by cutting into tissue. It is estimated more than 100,000 UK women have had a mesh fitted. Most of them suffer no ill effects,NHS England,externalsays. It is not clear how many women have experienced mesh complications. Case studies: Mesh led to 'excruciating pain' Hundreds suing NHS over vaginal implants What's the issue with mesh implants? But more than 800 women are taking legal actionagainst the NHS and mesh manufacturers. Mesh treatment for prolapse has been a particular concern. When a prolapse occurs, doctors sometimes insert a plastic mesh, made of polypropylene, into the wall of the vagina to act as scaffolding to support organs - such as the uterus, bowel and bladder - that have fallen out of place. The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence recently said this surgery shouldeffectively be banned. Another smaller device made from the same material, called a tape, which is used to stem the flow of urine from a leaking bladder, has a much lower risk of complications, experts say. The Department of Health have confirmed that their intention is for the mesh audit to take place, but have yet to release details. The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) advises women: ""If you are considering a procedure using mesh, you should have a detailed discussion with an expert healthcare professional about the benefits and risks of the surgery for you. If you decide to go ahead with a procedure using mesh, the operation should only be performed by a specialist with expertise in this technique."" A Scottish Government spokesperson said: ""In Scotland we asked NHS Scotland health boards to suspend the use of mesh in 2014 due to clinical concerns. That suspension will remain in place until we are satisfied all necessary procedures, approvals, and restrictions are in place.""

"The choreography of leaders' foreign trips is meticulously planned It's nearly wheels-up time on the prime minister's latest big overseas adventure. Touching down in China will provide Theresa May a temporary geographic escape from her critics. But this trip is also a desperately needed chance to project authority. Like it or not, in politics the images that voters see matter, and matter a lot. So leaders often invest a lot in the art of looking important. Whether taking part in a particular local ritual, inspecting the troops, gripping and grinning as another diplomatic handshake is documented for posterity. No 10's hopes for the next few days range beyond peace and quiet without mobile phone signal on the plane. Aides to Theresa May might well enjoy that part too. May urged to 'see off' hard Brexiteers EU sets out Brexit transition demands Major effort goes into planning these voyages, the topics chosen for discussion, provocative enough to be interesting, not so controversial as to be diplomatically awkward. The photo opportunities are planned meticulously. In a moment more ridiculous than anything The Thick of It's script writers could have come up with, one former senior politician's team, whose blushes I shall spare, spent considerable powers of persuasion on a foreign visit - in other words, frantic phone calls - cajoling the driver of a golden boat to stay in position on a lake to make the backdrop of the images of their boss look good. Neither the tide, nor the language barrier, made that easy. But foreign trips are also notorious for providing opportunities for things to go wrong. Theresa May's early dash to the Trump's White House seemed such a good idea to Number 10 at the time, before the image of him grasping her hand, then his announcement of the travel ban while she was in the air. But there are always opportunities for things to go wrong By the time the No 10 team and we, the travelling press pack, landed in Ankara, shock had gone round the world and the UK had to give an answer. Theresa May's reluctance to do so may have hampered the last stage of what her team had hoped would be a triumphant trip, ending with journalists heckling her when she refused to give a full answer. Not surprisingly, by the time we landed back at Heathrow, the government had concluded it needed to clarify and a new line was emerging just as the bedraggled and exhausted lobby poured off the plane. This time, the trip begins with the Tory Party already in a distinctly grumpy mood. To send Theresa May on her way, a joint article has foundits way to The Sun,external, by three well known MPs, Nick Boles, Robert Halfon and Nicholas Soames, demanding that Number 10 ups its game and turns the screw. Their frustration is that Downing Street's plans for the country aside from Brexit aren't bold enough. It's more diplomatic than Mr Boles' recent description of some members of the government as ""boiled rabbits"", but it hardly dampens down the  perception that Theresa May is somehow falling short. And on the other side of the Tory debate, where Brexiteers have been even more rattled of late, one of their own side, Liam Fox, warning in The Sun they may have to ""live with disappointment"". (Although Mr Fox has since told the BBC he was referring to people who were plotting against Mrs May) Eurosceptic efforts to increase the pressure in the last week or so have been directed at the Cabinet as well as the prime minister, in the hope of forcing Brexiteer ministers to be more forceful in the crucial debates. Mr Fox's intervention therefore could have the opposite of its desired effect. In the next few days, Theresa May will have put physical distance between herself and her woes, but she can't hide from her party's problems. Any number of smiling, carefully choreographed photo opportunities abroad can't change the domestic backdrop. However successful any prime minister's trip might be, they eventually have to fly home.

"Anna Soubry urged the prime minister to show leadership on Brexit Theresa May has been warned the UK risks disaster unless she ""sees off hard Brexiteers"" in her own party amid continuing Tory divisions over Europe. Ex-minister Anna Soubry said the PM must not let what she said were 35 MPs dictate the terms of the UK's EU exit. No 10 says Mrs May had made progress in the negotiations and set out a ""clear vision"" of the UK's future relations. But Labour said days of infighting showed the Tories were ""incapable"" of setting out a clear position on Brexit. During an urgent question in the Commons on the second phase of Brexit talks, Sir Bill Cash urged the UK to reject the EU's guidelines for a transition period after its departure on March 29, 2019, while Philip Hollobone said the Treasury must ""get with the programme"" and accept the UK was separating itself from the EU. Downing Street has rejected calls for Chancellor Philip Hammond - who has come under fire in recent days after suggesting Brexit should result in ""very modest"" changes in EU-UK trade - to be sacked. Greening calls for return of student grants Trump 'would've done Brexit differently' Laura Kuenssberg: Tories' Brexit agonies resurface There have been rumblings among some Conservative MPs about the performance of both the chancellor and the prime minister. At a Westminster event on Monday one Conservative MP, Johnny Mercer said the ""window is closing"" for the PM to meet the challenges of leadership. This video can not be played David Lidington, minister for the Cabinet Office, says the Conservative ""family"" should think about more than Brexit And Ms Soubry - who favours the UK remaining in the customs union and single market - said Mrs May must exert her authority over the Brexit process by putting the ""interests of the economy over and above ideology"". ""When is the government going to stand up against the hard Brexiteers who mainly inhabit these benches - there's only about 35 of them - see them off, and make sure that we get a sensible Brexit, because if we don't, we will sleepwalk into a disastrous Brexit for generations to come."" Davis plays down Tory Brexit row Rees-Mogg and Hammond at odds over Brexit As the EU published its guidelines for negotiationson a transition or implementation period after the UK leaves, there have been warnings from Tory Eurosceptics that the UK will stay in the EU ""in all but name"". Sir Bill Cash said the PM must reject any outcome which saw the UK having to accept EU law during the transition period and submit to the authority of the European Court of Justice to enforce compliance. ""Given we are leaving the EU, and therefore the customs union, single market and provisions relating to free movement, is the government going to reject this new EU ultimatum,"" he said. ""Does the government reject this European Council decision as inconsistent with us leaving the European Union?"" Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, former education secretary Justine Greening said she remained a ""firm supporter"" of Mrs May and called on ""soundings off"" to stop. ""I think people need to get behind her. I think she is doing an important job for our country. We need to support her in that impossible, almost, task that she has negotiating Brexit."" During the reshuffle earlier this month, Mrs May had wanted to move Mrs Greening to the Department for Work and Pensions, but she refused and quit the government instead. Allow Twitter content?

Since her departure, Ms Greening has been accused by the PM's former adviser Nick Timothy of blocking moves to reduce tuition fees in her old job. Asked about this, Ms Greening said she had opposed a review into cutting the maximum level of fees that can be charged, suggesting this would have kicked the issue ""into the long grass"". She warned that variable tuition fees could lead to science, technology, engineering and maths degrees becoming more expensive with poorer students feeling they ought to focus on ""cheaper"" subjects. And she said it was ""wrong"" that poorer students were the main losers from the scrapping of maintenance grants. The Â£3,387 grants towards living costs were available to students from families with annual incomes of Â£25,000.

"The European Union haslaid out its guidelines,external(known officially as supplementary directives) for the transition period after the UK formally leaves it, presumably in March next year. This is just the start of the negotiations - this is the agreed position of the other 27 member states. It's quite a dense, legalistic document, so Reality Check has pulled out some of the more important sections. This is a bit of a warning shot. The guidelines begin with several paragraphs reminding us of what's been agreed so far, and emphasise that those agreements have to be respected if further progress is to be made. One example: the EU believes there was an understanding that the transition period would maintain the status quo - in other words, all existing rules, regulations and arrangements would continue to operate. But the UK is now seeking some exceptions, and that will complicate matters. The government hopes a deal on the transition can be completed in March, but there's no guarantee that will happen. Irish border alert - don't think that you've heard the last of it. The language used in the December agreement was a fudge, and it will be difficult to translate into a legal text. Remember, the UK pledged that - if all else failed - it would maintain full alignment with those rules of the single market and the customs union that affected the border. The EU isn't sure how that can be done if the UK insists on leaving the single market and the customs union. There are various legal quirks to be found in small territories around the edges of the EU, but the challenge in Ireland is of a different scale. Creative solutions are required. This is an old favourite making yet another comeback, but it is worth highlighting again. It is one of the ""core principles"" the EU says it will apply to both transitional arrangements and the future relationship with the UK. So, during the transition, the EU will insist that freedom of movement of people should continue in full, as should UK participation in the single market and the customs union. Suggestions from London that some things could change during the transition (hence the phrase ""implementation"" period) are met with raised eyebrows and rolling eyes elsewhere on the Continent. Remember, the acquis is the set of laws, treaties and agreements that apply to all members. This one is politically difficult for the UK government, given the scale of unrest on its back benches. The EU says the UK will have to accept any new laws passed during the transition even though it will no longer have any say in making them. Brexit Secretary David Davis has pointed out it takes about two years for new legislation to make its way through the EU system, so most new laws will have been drafted while the UK was still a member state. But he also said it was important to find a mechanism for resolving concerns about any new laws the UK did not like. The opening gambit from the EU suggests there is very little wiggle room. This is a quick reminder of the official position of the other 27 member states: the UK can't actually implement new agreements with other countries during what it likes to call the implementation period, unless the EU gives a nod of approval. Spoiler: the EU won't do that for important things such as ambitious new trade deals. The government points out it will be able to negotiate and even sign trade deals during this period, but implementation will have to wait. It is a moot point anyway, because we do not know whether other countries will be willing to finalise a trade deal with the UK before they know what the future UK-EU trade relationship is going to be. This is the kicker towards the end, which is giving rise to accusations from Brexiteers that the UK will become a ""vassal state"" during transition. The UK will no longer play any formal role, or have any vote, in any of the EU institutions, even though it will be obliged to follow all EU laws. The government points out this will apply only for a strictly time-limited period, and says it is necessary to provide business with the continuity it seeks. In fact, the EU guidelines say the transition should last less than two years - ""not beyond 31 December 2020"". But many business groups worry that will not be long enough. Perhaps that's one of the reasons why an annex to these guidelines says they will be kept under review and updated as necessary.

"This video can not be played Chris Parker was interviewed by reporters in the aftermath of the attack A homeless man who stole from victims of the Manchester Arena bomb attack has been jailed. Chris Parker was hailed a hero after saying he helped, but CCTV showed him stealing from two victims and taking photos of others as they lay dying. The 33-year-old had previously admitted stealing a purse and a mobile phone. Jailing him for four years and three months at Manchester Crown Court, Judge David Hernandez told Parker: ""You were not the hero you pretended to be."" The judge added: ""You were just a common thief."" Parker pleaded guilty to two counts of theft and one of fraud after admitting using a debit card from the stolen purse. Judge Hernandez said: ""You stole from people who were seriously injured at a time when others were either dead or dying. ""It is hard to contemplate a more reprehensible set of circumstances."" The judge told Chris Parker it was ""hard to contemplate a more reprehensible set of circumstances"" Salman Abedi detonated a homemade bomb at an Ariana Grande concert at Manchester Arena on 22 May, killing 22 people and injuring many more. CCTV footage played in court showed Parker leaning over injured survivor Pauline Healey and taking her handbag to steal her purse, as her teenage granddaughter lay dying nearby. Hours later, Parker was using Mrs Healey's bank card at a local McDonald's restaurant. The court heard the footage also captured him taking photographs of the victims, including one of Mrs Healey. Prosecutor Louise Brandon showed the judge four pictures Parker took in the foyer which, she said, he later sold for Â£100. She said the CCTV footage shows Parker ""taking the opportunities that presented themselves to him to take photographs and to look for and, where possible, take valuable items, such as purses and mobile telephones from the bags of the victims"". ""As the tragedy unfolded around him, when the vast majority of those who were in the arena with him were trying to save lives and care for the injured and lost, the defendant was focused on seeking to take advantage of the situation,"" she added. Salman Abedi detonated a home-made bomb in the foyer of the arena on 22 May last year Parker also stole a mobile phone from a 14-year-old girl who was seriously hurt in the blast. Miss Brandon said the teenager had been holding it at the time of the explosion. Parker then picked it up, the court heard. The prosecutor said the girl's phone rang a number of times as people tried to contact her, but Parker terminated one call with an automatic return text message which read: ""Sorry I can't talk right now."" In a victim personal statement, the girl's mother said the theft was ""yet another blow as to how despicable people could be"". Supt Chris Hill, from Greater Manchester Police, said: ""No matter what personal circumstances you might find yourself in, to steal from injured and terrified innocent people is deplorable. ""Parker exploited these people when they were at their most vulnerable and needed the help of those around them."" The judge told Parker he will serve half his sentence in custody before being released on licence. He also banned him from Manchester city centre for 10 years. When the story of Parker's ""heroism"" was originally reported,an appeal on the crowdfunding website GoFundMe raised Â£52,000. A spokesman for GoFundMe said Parker did not receive the money and it has been returned to the donors. 'Hero' admits stealing from blast victims Manchester attack 'hero' admits theft.

"This video can not be played Claire had to carry her pregnancy to full term and describes her experiences The Republic of Ireland's decision to hold a referendum in May on whether to reform the country's near-total ban on abortion has triggered strong reaction. Voters will be asked whether they want to keep the constitutional restrictions or scrap them, allowing MPs to legislate on the sensitive issue. PM Leo Varadkar urged all sides to be respectful in the run-up to the poll. Abortion is now allowed when a woman's life is at risk - not in cases of fatal foetal abnormality, rape or incest. After Monday's announcement, Children's Minister Katherine Zappone said: ""As an independent woman sitting at the cabinet table, I believe we have reached a significant moment and I am full of emotion at this time. ""As we continue our preparation for a referendum, it is my firm hope we will have a respectful debate based on the facts. I hope we will live together in an Ireland someday soon where abortion is safe, legal and rare."" This video can not be played Irish PM on abortion: 'We cannot continue to export our problems' The May vote will decide whether to repeal a constitutional amendment that effectively bans terminations. The ballot will not be on specific terms of any new law, but on whether to retain or repeal article 40.3.3 of the constitution, known as the Eighth Amendment. Abortion in Ireland: The fight for choice Varadkar will campaign for change ""Repeal the 8th"" mural unveiled in Dublin Speaking on RTÃ's Morning Ireland on Tuesday, Minister for Health Simon Harris said: ""Whether the Eighth Amendment is in our Constitution, or indeed not in our Constitution, abortion is a reality for Irish women. ""I cannot close my eyes and block my ears to the fact that 3,265 of our citizens travelled to the UK in 2016 from every county in Ireland. ""I cannot stand over a situation where the abortion pill is illegally accessed in this country and women, perhaps in the privacy of their own bedroom, in a lonely isolated place, [are] taking a pill without any medical supervision."" Using the hashtags #repealthe8th or #savethe8th, people have welcomed or condemned the decision. Ailbhe Smyth, who has campaigned to have the amendment repealed, welcomed it with open arms.

Michael O'Dowd, spokesman for a new organisation, Disability Voices for Life and who has a son with Down's syndrome, says the amendment could mean a drop in the number of babies with the condition born in Ireland. ""People whose disabilities are detected before birth are effectively being wiped out by abortion,external,"" he told the Irish Times. ""Ninety per cent of babies diagnosed with Down syndrome in Britain are aborted. In Denmark, 98% of children like my son are aborted, with Iceland now reporting a close to 100% abortion rate for babies with Down syndrome."" But barrister Paul Anthony McDermott says the term ""repeal and replace"" is a simple one that hides ""a certain amount of legal complexity"". He says the constitution as a whole prohibits abortion and that the proposed replacement clause does not provide immunity for a new abortion law. This means, that any citizen can still challenge the law if it is passed and say it is unconstitutional, he told RTÃ. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"This video can not be played Claire had to carry her pregnancy to full term and describes her experiences The Republic of Ireland's decision to hold a referendum in May on whether to reform the country's near-total ban on abortion has triggered strong reaction. Voters will be asked whether they want to keep the constitutional restrictions or scrap them, allowing MPs to legislate on the sensitive issue. PM Leo Varadkar urged all sides to be respectful in the run-up to the poll. Abortion is now allowed when a woman's life is at risk - not in cases of fatal foetal abnormality, rape or incest. After Monday's announcement, Children's Minister Katherine Zappone said: ""As an independent woman sitting at the cabinet table, I believe we have reached a significant moment and I am full of emotion at this time. ""As we continue our preparation for a referendum, it is my firm hope we will have a respectful debate based on the facts. I hope we will live together in an Ireland someday soon where abortion is safe, legal and rare."" This video can not be played Irish PM on abortion: 'We cannot continue to export our problems' The May vote will decide whether to repeal a constitutional amendment that effectively bans terminations. The ballot will not be on specific terms of any new law, but on whether to retain or repeal article 40.3.3 of the constitution, known as the Eighth Amendment. Abortion in Ireland: The fight for choice Varadkar will campaign for change ""Repeal the 8th"" mural unveiled in Dublin Speaking on RTÃ's Morning Ireland on Tuesday, Minister for Health Simon Harris said: ""Whether the Eighth Amendment is in our Constitution, or indeed not in our Constitution, abortion is a reality for Irish women. ""I cannot close my eyes and block my ears to the fact that 3,265 of our citizens travelled to the UK in 2016 from every county in Ireland. ""I cannot stand over a situation where the abortion pill is illegally accessed in this country and women, perhaps in the privacy of their own bedroom, in a lonely isolated place, [are] taking a pill without any medical supervision."" Using the hashtags #repealthe8th or #savethe8th, people have welcomed or condemned the decision. Ailbhe Smyth, who has campaigned to have the amendment repealed, welcomed it with open arms.

Anti-abortion campaigners see the lives of the woman and her unborn child as equal The Eighth Amendment, which was approved by a 1983 referendum, ""acknowledges the right to life of the unborn"" - meaning the lives of the woman and her unborn child are seen as equal. Those on the anti-abortion side of the debate defend the unborn baby's rights to be taken into account. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Michael O'Dowd, spokesman for a new organisation, Disability Voices for Life and who has a son with Down's syndrome, says the amendment could mean a drop in the number of babies with the condition born in Ireland. ""People whose disabilities are detected before birth are effectively being wiped out by abortion,external,"" he told the Irish Times. ""Ninety per cent of babies diagnosed with Down syndrome in Britain are aborted. In Denmark, 98% of children like my son are aborted, with Iceland now reporting a close to 100% abortion rate for babies with Down syndrome."" But barrister Paul Anthony McDermott says the term ""repeal and replace"" is a simple one that hides ""a certain amount of legal complexity"". He says the constitution as a whole prohibits abortion and that the proposed replacement clause does not provide immunity for a new abortion law. This means, that any citizen can still challenge the law if it is passed and say it is unconstitutional, he told RTÃ. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Actor David Tennant has accepted substantial undisclosed damages from the publishers of the now defunct News of the World over a phone-hacking claim. News Group Newspapers (NGN) settled Mr Tennant's High Court claim and issued an apology. Tennant's lawyer said he was ""outraged and shocked"" by the invasion of privacy. NGN made no admission of liability to claims relating to The Sun. Tennant was among six people to settle claims with NGN on Tuesday. The other claimants were Olympic medallist Colin Jackson, actress Sophia Myles, party planner Fran Cutler, fashion designer Jess Morris and footballer David James's ex-wife, Tanya Frayne. Tennant first launched his lawsuit in March 2017, after the parent company of the News of the World closed its compensation scheme in 2013. Civil claims against NGN have been moving through the courts since 2012 and have resulted in four aborted trials, costing the company millions in legal fees. Tennant's counsel Sara Mansoori said the Doctor Who and Broadchurch actor ""is a very private individual and he is outraged and shocked by the invasions of his privacy by individuals working for, or acting on behalf, of the News of the World"". Ben Silverstone, acting on behalf of NGN, said the company offered sincere apologies for the distress caused, and it accepted no right to intrude into his private life in any way. Fran Cutler, left, with Kate Moss at London Fashion Week in 2009 Ms Mansoori, who was also representing party planner Fran Cutler, added that repeated publications had affected her business. She added that the exposure caused ""upset and suspicion"" among her friends actor Sadie Frost, model Kate Moss, Noel Gallagher's ex-wife Meg Matthews, and fashion designer Pearl Lowe - and damaged her business. Fashion designer Jess Morris believes the constant exposure of private information led to the end of her relationship with Welsh actor Rhys Ifans. The News of the World closed inJuly 2011 amid damaging allegations of phone-hacking at the paper, revealed by the Guardian. Journalists hacked into voicemail messages of celebrities by using a default factory-set PIN number. At its time of closure the Sunday tabloid sold about 2.8 million copies a week, and was famed for its celebrity scoops and sex scandals, earning it the nickname the News of the Screws. As a result of the scandal,a number of former journalists and managers of the paperwere put on trial, including former editor and Downing Street communications director Andy Coulson. He received an 18-month prison sentence, but was released after less than five months. Earlier this month four other TV stars settled claimswith the publisher of The Sun and the News of the World. Coronation Street actor Jimmi Harkishin, TV presenter Kate Thornton, comedian Vic Reeves - whose real name Jim Moir - and former Spice Girls manager Chris Herbert, all received damages on 18 January.

"The mesh implants are used to ease incontinence and to support organs The government has agreed to carry out a full audit of how many women in England have suffered complications as a result of vaginal mesh implants. Women have long complained about the implants - which are used to hold up pelvic organs to treat incontinence and prolapse - causing agony by cutting into tissue. It is estimated more than 100,000 UK women have had a mesh fitted. Most of them suffer no ill effects,NHS England,externalsays. It is not clear how many women have experienced mesh complications. Case studies: Mesh led to 'excruciating pain' Hundreds suing NHS over vaginal implants What's the issue with mesh implants? But more than 800 women are taking legal actionagainst the NHS and mesh manufacturers. Mesh treatment for prolapse has been a particular concern. When a prolapse occurs, doctors sometimes insert a plastic mesh, made of polypropylene, into the wall of the vagina to act as scaffolding to support organs - such as the uterus, bowel and bladder - that have fallen out of place. The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence recently said this surgery shouldeffectively be banned. Another smaller device made from the same material, called a tape, which is used to stem the flow of urine from a leaking bladder, has a much lower risk of complications, experts say. The Department of Health have confirmed that their intention is for the mesh audit to take place, but have yet to release details. The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) advises women: ""If you are considering a procedure using mesh, you should have a detailed discussion with an expert healthcare professional about the benefits and risks of the surgery for you. If you decide to go ahead with a procedure using mesh, the operation should only be performed by a specialist with expertise in this technique."" A Scottish Government spokesperson said: ""In Scotland we asked NHS Scotland health boards to suspend the use of mesh in 2014 due to clinical concerns. That suspension will remain in place until we are satisfied all necessary procedures, approvals, and restrictions are in place.""

"New OED addition hangry means bad-tempered or irritable as a result of hunger Mansplaining, ransomware and hangry are among more than 1,000 words that have been added to the latest Oxford English Dictionary (OED). Also included are initialisms used on the online parenting forum Mumsnet such as TTC - meaning trying to conceive. OED senior editor Fi Mooring said the words chosen will resonate ""even with people who are not parents"". The dictionary consults experts to determine what should be added to its 829,000 words. The OED is updated four times a year with the next update due in April 2018. TTC - trying to conceive BFN/ BFP - big fat negative/ big fat positive (related to the results of a pregnancy test) CIO - cry it out Hangry - bad-tempered or irritable as a result of hunger Hazzle - to dry in open air Lactivism - advocating in favour of breast-feeding, rather than bottle-feeding Tomgirl - a girl or woman who acts or dresses in a manner conventionally more associated with boys Geg - Liverpudlian slang for intruding or joining in uninvited Masstige - a combination of the words masses and prestige referring to cheap products marketed as luxurious Mansplaining is defined as explaining something ""needlessly, overbearingly, or condescendingly, especially to a woman, in a manner thought to reveal a patronising or chauvinistic attitude"". Researchers date early usage of that term to an internet exchange between a man and a woman in 2008. Although hangry has only come into common usage recently the word dates back to 1956 when it appeared in a psychoanalytic journal. The OED defines the new term snowflake as a description of someone who is ""overly sensitive or as feeling entitled to special treatment or consideration"". Ransomware is another new addition - less than a year since the NHS was one of a number of global institutions targeted by theWannaCry cyber attackthat was carried out with the use of malicious software. Chaebol is formed by combining the Korean words chae, meaning wealth, and bol, meaning faction and, in South Korea, means a large business conglomerate. However, recently the word has been used to describe a luxurious lifestyle associated with families who own such businesses. The new list sees American rapper Jay-Z get his sixth OED citation with the word swag being added to the dictionary. Swag, derived from the word swagger, describes a bold, self-confident manner and appeared in Jay-Z's Black Album: ""My self-esteem went through the roof, man. I got my swag."" Here are some of his other citations: ""My hand around her collar, feeding her cheese."" Cheese is American slang for money. ""We stand for hours waiting for bricks of government cheese."" Government cheese is a colloquial term for welfare benefits. ""We grow up knowing people who pay for everything with little plastic cardsâMedicare cards for checkups, EBT cards for food."" EBT stands for electronic benefits transfer - a system of paying out benefits with a card used in the US. ""Thirty minutes straight off the top of his head, never losing the beat, riding the handclaps."" Handclaps is the sound made by the clapping of hands. ""The school of hard knocks - I'm from the school of the hard knocks; we must not Let outsiders violate our blocks."" The school of hard knocks is used to describe the experience of a life of hardship as an education.

Brendon Batson, who played alongside Regis and Laurie Cunningham at West Brom, said: ""He had a calm presence and a ready smile. ""We played at a time when many black players suffered vile abuse. But Cyrille never lost his cool. You could not intimidate Cyrille Regis. ""We will never forget Cyrille. Nice one Cyrille, nice one son.""

"This video can not be played Liam Allan said he was ""disappointed"" with how his case was handled The Met has apologised to a student wrongly accused of rape for a series of errors in its handling of the case. A review found that a ""lack of knowledge"" by police and prosecutors was to blame for the botched prosecution against Liam Allan. The officer in charge of the case failed to find key evidence among 57,000 messages on the alleged victim's mobile phone, the report found. Mr Allan, 22, had been charged with 12 counts of rape and sexual assault. The case against Mr Allan at Croydon Crown Court was dropped after three days when the evidence on a computer disk containing 40,000 messages revealed the alleged victim had pestered him for ""casual sex"". Mr Allan, from Beckenham, in south-east London, had been under investigation for nearly two years before his trial collapsed. Mr Allan said he welcomed the recommendations made in the review but remained ""disappointed"" with the way his case was handled. He added: ""The report fails to address the true failures of this case."" The Met Police said the officer in charge of the case had asked to be moved to other duties, but has not been disciplined because there was no evidence of misconduct. The problems with disclosure in Mr Allan's case were caused by ""a combination of error, lack of challenge, and lack of knowledge"", a joint review by the Met and Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) found. The entire download of messages from the phone was not passed to the defence because the officer in the case said there was ""nothing relevant on it"", the review said. Liam Allan previously stated he felt 'betrayed' by the police and CPS. It is understood messages which later resulted in the collapse of the trial included some between the alleged victim and friends saying what a kind person Mr Allan was, how much she loved him and that she had had a great experience with him. There were also references to rape fantasies, Mr Allan's lawyer Simone Meerabux confirmed. The officer in the case admitted in an email included in the review that he had been mistaken in his belief that he looked through the whole download. Thousands of current rape and serious sexual assault cases in England and Wales are to be reviewedto ensure evidence has been disclosed. The Met said it had drafted in 120 officers to review 600 rape and sexual assault cases where a suspect has been charged to identify any similar problems. The Met said ""lessons would be learned"" from Liam Allan's collapsed rape trial Met Police Cdr Richard Smith and Claire Lindley, from the CPS, met face-to-face with Mr Allan on Monday to discuss the findings into the review. ""It is clear from our review that both the Met and the CPS did not carry out disclosure procedures properly in this case,"" Cdr Smith said. ""Although we are confident there was no malicious intent in this case, it was important that we carried out this urgent review and learn lessons from it."" Ms Lindley said Mr Allan's case had highlighted some ""systemic and deep-rooted issues"". She added: ""The prosecutors involved in this case did not sufficiently challenge the police about digital material. ""That meant that it took longer than was necessary to drop Mr Allan's case. For that, the CPS has offered an unreserved apology to him."" The Liam Allan case review sets out the errors which caused the late disclosure of evidence - but only hints at why police and prosecutors made the mistakes they did. The detective who failed to search properly for the alleged victim's phone messages suggested he may have been confused because he had so many phone downloads to analyse. It's thought the officer would have been responsible for over 20 cases, which Scotland Yard has acknowledged is too many. The force is short of specialist sexual offence investigators and has a high number of detective vacancies. The recommendations which accompany the review - for enhanced training, disclosure experts in the police and disclosure 'champions' in the CPS - indicate that in Liam Allen's case the issue simply wasn't seen as a priority, with those involved not adequately equipped or supervised.

"This video can not be played Claire had to carry her pregnancy to full term and describes her experiences The Irish government has agreed to hold a referendum at the end of May on whether to reform the country's near-total ban on abortion. The vote will decide whether to repeal a constitutional amendment that effectively bans terminations. Currently abortion is only allowed when a woman's life is at risk, but not in cases of rape, incest or fatal foetal abnormality. Prime Minister Leo Varadkar has said that he will campaign for reform. The ballot will not be on specific terms of any new law, but on whether to retain or repeal article 40.3.3 of the constitution, known as the Eighth Amendment. The amendment, which was approved by a 1983 referendum, ""acknowledges the right to life of the unborn"" - meaning the life of the woman and her unborn child are seen as equal. Tens of thousands rallied in Dublin in September for constitutional change Before the vote, the country's health minister will draft legislation proposing unrestricted abortion access be made available to women who are up to 12 weeks pregnant, and in exceptional circumstances after. An exact date for the referendum will be decided after it is debated in the Irish parliament. Campaigners have long called for the laws to be changed,and last year a special cross-party parliamentary committee and citizens assembly both recommended repealing the amendment. ""I know this will be a difficult decision for the Irish people to make,"" Mr Varadkar said. Abortion in Ireland: The fight for choice Varadkar will campaign for change ""Repeal the 8th"" mural unveiled in Dublin ""I know it is a very personal and private issue and for most of us it is not a black-and-white issue, it is one that is grey - the balance between the rights of a pregnant woman and the foetus or unborn."" Mr Varadkar, the country's former health minister who trained as a doctor, acknowledged that thousands of women in the country travelled every year for terminations or took illegal pills ordered online at home.

He said the current law meant that abortions in Ireland were ""unsafe, unregulated and illegal"". ""These journeys do not have to happen, and that can change, and that's now in our hands,"" he said. By BBC Dublin correspondent Shane Harrison The Irish government's preference is to hold the referendum in late May, during university term time, as it is expected that the majority of students will support the government. If there is a delay, polling is then most likely to happen at the start of June, when many Irish students leave the island for the summer. Irish Health Minister Simon Harris has been working with officials in his department and the attorney general on the wording of the referendum, which is expected to be formally published at the beginning of March. ""It is very important to stress any legislation to amend constitution would remain subject to review,"" said Mr Harris. ""The government does not intend to, or wish to, limit the power of our courts to interpret law. Anyone who wants any change to our regime, it is necessary to repeal the Eighth. ""This issue is not going away. It is time for the people of Ireland to have their say on that."" In 2016, 3,265 women and girls gave Republic of Ireland addresses when accessing abortion services at clinics in England and Wales,external, according to UK Department of Health statistics. The National Women's Council of Ireland (NWCI) welcomed Monday's announcement. ""Every pregnancy is different, every decision is deeply personal. Women and girls in Ireland deserve their dignity. They deserve the right to privacy, family and home,"" said the group's director Orla O'Connor. The Republic of Ireland currently has a near total ban on abortion. Terminations are not permitted in cases of rape or incest, or when there is a foetal abnormality and thousands of women travel abroad for a termination every year. The eighth amendment to the Republic's constitution, introduced in 1983, ""acknowledges the right to life of the unborn"". However, there have been significant challenges and changes to the law in recent years. A campaign to liberalise abortion gathered momentum in 2012, after Indian woman Savita Halappanavardied in a Galway hospital after she was refused an abortion during a miscarriage. Savita Halappanavar died after a miscarriage in University Hospital in Galway in October 2012 The following year,legislation was passedto legalise abortion when doctors deem that a woman's life is at risk due to medical complications, or at risk of taking her life. Twenty years before Mrs Halappanavar's death, a 14-year-old rape victim was initially prevented from travelling to England to terminate her pregnancy. It became known as the X Case, as the girl could not be named to protect her right to anonymity. The 1992 ban on travel was later overturned by the Irish Supreme Court. A referendum approved a further update to the constitution, stating that the eighth amendment did not restrict the freedom to travel to another state.

"Men working for the BBC earn an average of 9.3% more than women, a report found Women at the BBC have told MPs they faced ""veiled threats"" while trying to raise the subject of equal pay. More than 150 women have put forwardwritten evidence to the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee,,externalahead of a hearing on Wednesday. Auditors PwC have separately reviewed the pay and diversity of presenters, correspondents and on-air talent. The BBC's media editor Amol Rajan says the corporation is proposing a pay cap of Â£320,000 for its news presenters. The change, following an outcry about the size of the salaries of the BBC's highest paid stars, will only affect a handful of people but forms part of a wider restructuring of pay of on-air staff. Tuesday's announcement about on-air pay and Wednesday's committee session take place against the backdrop of a long-running debate about gender pay at the BBC, which began last summer after thecorporation published its salaries for on-air staffearning more than Â£150,000. BBC director general Tony Hall and Carrie Gracie, whoquit as the BBC's China editorover ""pay discrimination"" this month, will be questioned by the committee of MPs. The BBC's media editor says the proposed Â£320,000 cap has not yet been fully agreed or signed off and will apply only to on-air staff working full time. It will affect presenters, editors and correspondents, who will be given time to respond to the proposals. However, it is not clear whether on air-staff will be able to earn more from other BBC work, for instance on entertainment programmes. Last week,six of the BBC's leading male presenters agreed to take pay cuts. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Damian Collins, chair of the DCMS select committee, said the Â£320,000 pay cap didn't fully address his concerns. ""It actually affects a relatively small number of people,"" he said. ""If you look at the grievances that Carrie Gracie brought forward, saying she wasn't paid the same amount as other international editors at the BBC, this new proposed pay cap wouldn't have addressed that at all."" Collins also discussed the pay disparity for talent outside of news - in areas of entertainment and sport. He said: ""Many people would look at that and say, 'why is it that Gary Lineker is paid many multiples of what Clare Balding is paid?'. ""Many people would say she does a job of equal value, working on many different outlets for the BBC and covering a wide range of sports. And that's why this review must go much broader than that."" The National Union of Journalists and the BBC Women group have criticised the BBC's record on equal pay ahead of the MPs' inquiry into the issue. BBC Women, a group that represents female BBC journalists and producers, said it had ""no confidence in the on-air review"" because it had not been consulted and felt it had ""been excluded from the process"". The salaries of Chris Evans and Claudia Winkleman were among those revealed last summer ""We believe there is a wider culture of gender discrimination, which can be seen in patterns of promotion, especially after women take maternity leave."" They added: ""While individual BBC managers have been supportive there is still a bunker mentality in some quarters and women have experienced veiled threats made against them when they raised the subject of equal pay."" The group included several individual testimonies in its evidence to MPs, including one from former BBC Scotland health correspondent, Eleanor Bradford. How the BBC gender pay story unfolded Chris Evans tops list of best-paid stars Bradford said she discovered she ""was one of the lowest-paid correspondents at BBC Scotland, despite regularly appearing on UK-wide news and delivering exclusive stories"". She said she regularly asked for a pay rise and eventually was given a Â£5,000 increase but it was not backdated and she remained about Â£10,000 below some male colleagues doing exactly the same job. She subsequently left the BBC. Bradford told BBC Radio 4 Today that she felt it was an ""unconscious bias"", but there were ""efforts to change things"" during her last couple of years with the BBC. ""I do hope that there will be change, but I think nevertheless the spotlight should be shown on this because I think the change isn't happening fast enough,"" she said. Thirteen further cases have been put forward anonymously. They include: A TV news presenter who said she ""had been sitting next to a man doing an identical job who was being paid tens of thousands of pounds more...  I am told that we are now being paid at the same rate per day, but there is no transparency"" A BBC reporter who found her full time equivalent salary for making identical programmes was about half her male counterpart A sports broadcaster who has worked for the BBC for almost 30 years, both as staff and freelance, who found her Â£500 pay on a flagship radio programme was less than half of the male presenter A regional news presenter who after becoming aware that her male colleague's salary was a third more than the figure she had been offered was given a 5% increase An award-winning broadcaster on a flagship arts programme said she found her male colleague was being paid 50% more per show. ""When I asked for (the) pay gap to be corrected the line manager told me 'the BBC doesn't do equal pay', and that in raising the issue I was being 'aggressive'. I refused to back down and eventually was given the same rate as my male colleague and it was backdated"". A BBC spokesperson said: ""We look forward to an informed debate at the select committee based on all the facts. ""The BBC is committed to equal pay, and we don't accept the assertion we have not been complying with the Equality Act, nor do we offer inferior contracts based on someone's gender or race. Nicky Campbell, Huw Edwards, Jon Sopel, Jeremy Vine, Nick Robinson and John Humphrys are to take pay cuts ""We want to help women progress in their career and have set out ambitious targets to close the gender pay gap, filled by women. We've also set out action to achieve them. ""We have already set out how we plan to deliver real pay transparency for our staff, and today we'll publish proposals to significantly change how we manage on-air pay so we have a clear, transparent and fair system for the future."" The spokesperson added that the corporation would ""not getting in to debates at the moment on pay band levels"". Damian Collins MP, chair of the DCMS committee, said that the complaints from the BBC Women group and the NUJ included those about ""unlawful pay disparities on grounds of race, discrimination against women returning to work after periods of maternity leave, and discrimination against part-time workers and/or those who request flexible working"". A report published in October foundmen working for the BBC earn an average of 9.3% more than women. The figure covered all staff, on and off air, and was put down to the fact there are more men in senior jobs. It compares with a UK average of 18%, and BBC director general Tony Hall said it showed the BBC was ""in a better place than many organisations"".

"This video can not be played 'My husband had to quit work to care for me' Every person receiving Personal Independence Payments (PIP) will have their claim reviewed, the Department for Work and Pensions has said. A total of 1.6 million of the main disability benefit claims will be reviewed, with around 220,000 people expected to receive more money. It comes after the DWP decided not to challenge a court ruling that said changes to PIP were unfair to people with mental health conditions. The review could cost Â£3.7bn by 2023. The minister for disabled people, Sarah Newton, said the DWP was embarking on a ""complex exercise and of considerable scale"". She added: ""Whilst we will be working at pace to complete this exercise it is important that we get it right."" What is the row around PIPs all about? U-turn in disability benefits row Why I secretly taped my disability assessment Ministers made changes to PIP in 2017 which limited the amount of support people with mental health conditions could receive. As a result, people who were unable to travel independently on the grounds of psychological distress - as opposed to other conditions - were not entitled to the enhanced mobility rate of the benefit. The government pressed ahead with the proposals, despite criticism from an independent tribunal in 2016. An independent review of PIP in 2017 was critical of the assessment system, afterrevealing 65% of those who appealed against rejected claimssaw the decision overturned by judges. And in December, a High Court judge ruled the alterations ""blatantly discriminate"" against people with psychiatric problems and were a breach of their human rights. Last week, new Work and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey announced the governmentwould not appeal against the judgement, despite not agreeing with certain aspects of it. The government's announcement to review all claims for PIP is not, as it may seem at first glance, a complete overhaul of the system. This judgement won't affect people with physical disabilities, but the DWP will be going through everyone currently in receipt of PIP to narrow the 1.6 million claims down to approximately 220,000 people it thinks will be affected. The DWP has told me it will prioritise claimants who were disallowed PIP over those already in receipt of the award. Shadow work and pensions secretary Debbie Abrahams said it was ""shocking"" that so many claims were having to be reviewed and expressed concern that a timetable for action was yet to be put forward. ""The government was wrong to cut PIP benefits in the first place, wrong to bring in the PIP regulations last year and it was wrong to repeatedly ignore the views of the courts,"" she said. Mark Atkinson, chief executive at disability charity Scope, said more had to be done to address all the issues. ""While it's crucial that the government urgently identifies and pays the vast numbers of disabled people who lost out on this vital support, this will not address the root of the problem,"" he said. ""The fundamentally flawed PIP assessment needs a radical overhaul so it accurately identifies the extra costs disabled people face."" Philip Connolly, policy manager at Disability Rights UK, welcomed the review but expressed regret at ""persistent failures"" of the assessment process. ""Huge amounts of taxpayers' money is being wasted on poor quality assessments which deny disabled people benefits that they qualify for."" Campaigners protesting Personal Independence Payments outside courts in London Keith Thompson, who lives with bipolar disorder, had his PIP reduced from Â£420 to Â£220 because he did not score enough points on his assessment. The 49-year-old was moved from the Disability Living Allowance (DLA) to PIP in October 2017. He told the BBC: ""I got a letter saying my payments would stop and I would be reviewed by assessment for PIP. ""The lady there wasn't a psychiatrist. She asked if I could walk, none of the questions related to any of my mental health problems."" He said that he ""felt totally discriminated"", and that the ""whole process was totally disgusting"". He was initially told he would receive no PIP payment, but that was later reviewed and he was informed he would receive a minor PIP, rather than the full amount. ""I don't know what's going to happen. What if it gets reviewed and I end up with nothing?"" Kelly Bailey lives with borderline personality disorder, and says she had her PIP removed when she informed the DWP her condition had worsened. ""They sent me for a consultation, we spoke for a little while, and then they sent a letter saying thanks for letting us look at your claim again. ""I got the letter in January. The letter said that my needs have changed so now they're stopping my payments.""

The professional dancer revealed during a TV interview on Tuesday that the decision was made by the BBC, saying he was ""in shock"". ""They made an editorial decision not to have me back on the show,"" he said on ITV's Lorraine. A spokesman for the BBC One show thanked Cole for ""being part of the show since the beginning"" and contributing to its success. Cole said: ""I'm a little bit in shock at the moment. ""I'm quite emotional and a bit raw about it. I am very disappointed. It's an editorial decision. I will never know the ins and outs.

"This video can not be played Fans and players salute Cyrille Regis ahead of a celebration of his life at The Hawthorns A celebration of the life of footballer Cyrille Regis has been held at the ground where he started his ""pioneering"" career. The former West Bromwich Albion striker, who is widely credited with inspiring a generation of black players,died on 14 January, aged 59. Regis's funeral cortege left The Hawthorns stadium at about 08:30 GMT for a private family funeral service. The public celebration at the ground was packed with people paying tribute. Almost 2,000 tickets were available for the celebration of the former England international's life at The Hawthorns, where Regis began his professional career in 1977.. His family emerged inside the ground to Chris Love singing Bring Him Home from the musical Les Miserables. Cyrille Regis remembered: Live coverage Family friend Karl George said relatives had been ""overwhelmed"" by the support since he died and that ""it's not goodbye but it is 'until we meet again'."" Reading his eulogy, Regis's widow, Julia Regis, told the crowd: ""Cyrille treated everyone like they were the most important person he ever met."" She received a standing ovation after paying tribute to her ""lovely, caring amazing husband"". Cyrille Regis was the third black player to be capped by England Hundreds of fans gathered at The Hawthorns to see the funeral cortege depart The celebration featured ""songs, a lively atmosphere and personal tributes"", his former club said. Brendon Batson, who played alongside Regis and Laurie Cunningham at West Brom, said: ""He had a calm presence and a ready smile. ""We played at a time when many black players suffered vile abuse. But Cyrille never lost his cool. You could not intimidate Cyrille Regis. ""We will never forget Cyrille. Nice one Cyrille, nice one son."" Regis, who lived in Edgbaston, Birmingham, was capped five times by England and played for several clubs including West Brom, Coventry and Aston Villa.

"Schools have been protesting about budget shortages Head teachers from 5,500 schools across England have signed a joint letter to Chancellor Philip Hammond warning of ""chronic"" funding shortages. It comes as a primary school in west London says it is considering cutting hours because of money problems. The heads are warning of budget gaps and unequal funding - saying schools would have an extra Â£5.5bn if they were funded at the same level as Hackney. The government has promised to move Â£1.3bn extra into school budgets. And a Department for Education spokeswoman said the heads' calculations were ""thoroughly misleading"". This is the latest stage in a campaign by head teachers, in 32 counties from Cornwall to Cumbria, pressing for higher funding for schools and a fairer distribution. They are sending an ""invoice"" to Mr Hammond for their funding shortfalls - saying this would ask for the money ""owed to the pupils and families that we serve"". Is social mobility really about levels of school funding? School funding problems in Damian Hinds' in-tray Greening moves more money into frontline for schools If all schools received the same funding as those in Westminster, another Â£3.5bn would be needed for school budgets, says the Worth Less? campaign. ""The scale of the funding differences between low-funded counties when compared to areas such as London is beyond belief,"" says Jules White, a West Sussex head who has co-ordinated the protests. ""Only additional funding will put matters right,"" says Mr White, leading a campaign which has contacted more than three-and-a-half million parents in schools which have signed up to the joint letter. The campaign says there can be a Â£2m per year difference between the incomes of secondary schools in different parts of the country. The heads have also highlighted how high levels of school funding correspond with high levels of social mobility. Among the top 20 highest funded areas in England, 18 are in London. And among the 20 places at the top of the government's social mobility index, 17 are in London. It means that Barnsley, near the bottom for social mobility, has Â£4,729 per year for each secondary pupil, while Hackney, in the top five for social mobility, receives Â£7,840. Pressures over funding have forced St. Mary's Catholic primary school in Isleworth, in the London Borough of Hounslow, to warn parents that it might have to reduce hours on Fridays from the autumn. The school has consulted with parents and told them that there have already been savings such as not filling vacant posts and reducing music lessons. There have been suggestions that parents could be asked to pay to fill the budget gap - but the school says this would mean payments of Â£400 per child. Parents have been asked to consider finding childcare arrangements for Friday afternoons. Paul Whiteman, leader of the National Association of Head Teachers, warned of the impact of funding pressures. ""It will now be impossible for many schools to avoid making redundancies, to continue to keep class sizes at an acceptable level, and to offer a full and rounded curriculum to all pupils,"" said Mr Whiteman. In the wake of the general election, where school funding had become a prominent issue, the then education secretary, Justine Greening, announced that more of the Department for Education's budget would be put directly into schools. It will mean an extra Â£1.3bn over two years being moved into school budgets. A Department for Education spokeswoman said: ""The campaign's calculations are thoroughly misleading, and ignore the fact that under our national funding formula, funding is based on the needs and characteristics of each individual school. ""There are no cuts in funding. Every school will see an increase in funding through the formula from this year, and in 2019-20 all secondary schools will attract at least Â£4,800 per pupil, and all primary schools will attract at least Â£3,500 per pupil.""

"This video can not be played Pompeo on Russia, North Korea and Trump Chinese efforts to exert covert influence over the West are just as concerning as Russian subversion, the director of the CIA has said. Mike Pompeo told the BBC that the Chinese ""have a much bigger footprint"" to do this than the Russians do. As examples he cited efforts to steal US commercial information and infiltration of schools and hospitals - and this extended to Europe and the UK. Mr Pompeo was a hardline Republican congressman before becoming CIA chief. In his BBC interview, Mr Pompeo also said: He expected Russia to try to disrupt US mid-term electionsin November 2018. There had been no significant diminishing of Russian attempts at subversion in Europe and the US. North Korea may have the ability to strike the USwith nuclear missiles ""in a handful of months"" Recent claims in the book Fire and Fury that Mr Trump was not up to the job were ""drivel"".

This video can not be played CIA Director: China intent on stealing US secrets Earlier this year, a former CIA officer was arrested on charges of retaining classified information in a case thought to be connected to the dismantling of the agency's spy operations in China. In the two years before Jerry Chun Shing Lee's arrest, some 20 informants had been killed or jailed - one of the most disastrous failures of US intelligence in recent years. But officials did not know at the time whether to blame a mole or data hack. The US spy chief told the BBC that countries could collectively do more to combat Chinese efforts to exert power over the West. ""We can watch very focused efforts to steal American information, to infiltrate the United States with spies - with people who are going to work on behalf of the Chinese government against America,"" he said. ""We see it in our schools. We see it in our hospitals and medicals systems. We see it throughout corporate America. It's also true in other parts of the world... including Europe and the UK."" Gordon Corera, BBC security correspondent, CIA headquarters Russian interference has been the focus of political debate in Washington with allegations of hacking and releasing information as well as using social media to sow division. But the CIA director's surprising claim to me was that China has a more wide-ranging ability to exert influence and more needs to be done to confront it. China's reach, the CIA director says, ranges from traditional espionage (human and cyber) through allegations it has used stolen intellectual property to helps its businesses. But it also includes the way in which it uses its economic weight to influence American companies seeking access to its market.

"This video can not be played The duchess scored one goal, while the duke got two The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have gone head-to-head in a penalty shootout while learning about bandy hockey in Sweden's capital Stockholm. The duke scored two goals to the duchess's one after watching the 11-player game, played on a rink similar in size to a football pitch. They then went to the country's royal palace for a lunch hosted by the king, Carl XVI Gustaf. After their two-day visit to Sweden, they will travel to Norway. George and Charlotte join tour of Poland Duchess of Cambridge expecting third child Royal Family tree and line of succession Anna Widing, an international bandy player, coached the couple before the shootout.

Ms Widing added: ""It was a privilege for us to show our sport to them."" Prince William and Catherine began their day with a hot drink from a flask carried in a case known as a bandy portfolj (bandy briefcase). The duchess, who is expecting the couple's third child, drank an alcohol-free version of the drink called glogg, which is usually mulled wine or coffee with alcohol. The Duchess of Cambridge met members of the public in Stortorget square At the king's lunch, the couple met the king and queen of Sweden and 15 other members of the royal court, including Crown Princess Victoria and her husband Prince Daniel.

There are two teams, each consisting of 11 players.The full rules from the Federation of International Bandy are available online,external.

"This video can not be played Artist Bob and Roberta Smith on why creative subjects are important in schools Creative arts subjects are being cut back in many secondary schools in England, a BBC survey suggests. More than 1,200 schools responded - over 40% of secondary schools. Of the schools that responded, nine in every 10 said they had cut back on lesson time, staff or facilities in at least one creative arts subject. But Ofsted chief Amanda Spielman said academic subjects were the best route to higher-level study, particularly for working-class children. However, schools told the BBC that the increased emphasis on core academic subjects, together with funding pressures, were the most common reasons for cutting back on resources for creative subjects. Arts and creativity 'squeezed out of schools' Music removed from school's curriculum Music 'could face extinction' in secondary schools The data provides an up-to-date snapshot of decisions being made in secondary schools. The findings suggest music, art and drama, as well as design and technology are all being squeezed. Of the schools responding, four in 10 were spending less money on facilities, more than three out of 10 had reduced timetabled lessons, and some reported having fewer specialist staff. Many schools are struggling to maintain arts subjects In both art and music, one out of 10 schools said it was increasingly relying on voluntary donations by parents. Extra-curricular clubs were also being cut back in a similar proportion of schools responding. Jez Bennett, a musician and head teacher of Elizabeth Woodville school, in Northamptonshire, said: ""I've had to make some decisions about whether I can afford to run certain classes, and I know that there are schools that have cut GCSEs in art, music, drama, photography."" One of the hard decisions was to cut subsidies for instrumental music lessons, with the cost passed to parents. And the school no longer teaches dance as a separate subject. Mr Bennett said these subjects taught a wide range of skills much in demand from employers, particularly ""collaboration, creativity, self-expression and control"". Research from the Education Policy Institute has shown a decline in the proportion of pupils taking at least one arts subject at GCSE level. In 2016 it reached 53.5%, the lowest level for a decade. The schools responding to the BBC suggested this trend that could continue, with three in 10 saying they feared they would have to drop at least one creative subject at GCSE. John Kampfner, from the Creative Industries Federation, said it was worrying that some schools were reporting that art subjects were now seen as softer options. ""Arts provision should also be seen as a core subject,"" he said. ""There's nothing soft about subjects that create the talent that creates the fastest growing sector of our economy."" A Department for Education spokeswoman said that between 2016 and 2020 the government will have spent Â£400m on arts and music education. ""Since 2011, the proportion of pupils in state funded schools taking at least one arts subject has increased."" The spokeswoman added that in council schools music is a compulsory subject up to Year 9 while ""academies are required to provide a broad and balanced curriculum, which Ofsted consider in their inspections"". Amanda Spielman, Ofsted's chief inspector of schools for England, said she supported the shift back towards traditional academic subjects at GCSE, as these offered the best chance of progress to higher-level study. ""The worst thing that can happen to a working-class child is they don't get the full education to 16 that leaves them with options that could take them to university or vocational education,"" said Ms Spielman. But she added Ofsted expected a broad education, including the arts, to be available in the early part of secondary school, arguing that schools should ""embrace creative subjects"" through extra activities such as plays, art clubs and orchestras.

"This video can not be played Claire had to carry her pregnancy to full term and describes her experiences The Irish government has agreed to hold a referendum at the end of May on whether to reform the country's near-total ban on abortion. The vote will decide whether to repeal a constitutional amendment that effectively bans terminations. Currently abortion is only allowed when a woman's life is at risk, but not in cases of rape, incest or fatal foetal abnormality. Prime Minister Leo Varadkar has said that he will campaign for reform. The ballot will not be on specific terms of any new law, but on whether to retain or repeal article 40.3.3 of the constitution, known as the Eighth Amendment. The amendment, which was approved by a 1983 referendum, ""acknowledges the right to life of the unborn"" - meaning the life of the woman and her unborn child are seen as equal. Tens of thousands rallied in Dublin in September for constitutional change Before the vote, the country's health minister will draft legislation proposing unrestricted abortion access be made available to women who are up to 12 weeks pregnant, and in exceptional circumstances after. An exact date for the referendum will be decided after it is debated in the Irish parliament. Campaigners have long called for the laws to be changed,and last year a special cross-party parliamentary committee and citizens assembly both recommended repealing the amendment. ""I know this will be a difficult decision for the Irish people to make,"" Mr Varadkar said. Abortion in Ireland: The fight for choice Varadkar will campaign for change ""Repeal the 8th"" mural unveiled in Dublin ""I know it is a very personal and private issue and for most of us it is not a black-and-white issue, it is one that is grey - the balance between the rights of a pregnant woman and the foetus or unborn."" Mr Varadkar, the country's former health minister who trained as a doctor, acknowledged that thousands of women in the country travelled every year for terminations or took illegal pills ordered online at home.

He said the current law meant that abortions in Ireland were ""unsafe, unregulated and illegal"". ""These journeys do not have to happen, and that can change, and that's now in our hands,"" he said. By BBC Dublin correspondent Shane Harrison The Irish government's preference is to hold the referendum in late May, during university term time, as it is expected that the majority of students will support the government. If there is a delay, polling is then most likely to happen at the start of June, when many Irish students leave the island for the summer. Irish Health Minister Simon Harris has been working with officials in his department and the attorney general on the wording of the referendum, which is expected to be formally published at the beginning of March. ""It is very important to stress any legislation to amend constitution would remain subject to review,"" said Mr Harris. ""The government does not intend to, or wish to, limit the power of our courts to interpret law. Anyone who wants any change to our regime, it is necessary to repeal the Eighth. ""This issue is not going away. It is time for the people of Ireland to have their say on that."" In 2016, 3,265 women and girls gave Republic of Ireland addresses when accessing abortion services at clinics in England and Wales,external, according to UK Department of Health statistics. The National Women's Council of Ireland (NWCI) welcomed Monday's announcement. ""Every pregnancy is different, every decision is deeply personal. Women and girls in Ireland deserve their dignity. They deserve the right to privacy, family and home,"" said the group's director Orla O'Connor. The Republic of Ireland currently has a near total ban on abortion. Terminations are not permitted in cases of rape or incest, or when there is a foetal abnormality and thousands of women travel abroad for a termination every year. The eighth amendment to the Republic's constitution, introduced in 1983, ""acknowledges the right to life of the unborn"". However, there have been significant challenges and changes to the law in recent years. A campaign to liberalise abortion gathered momentum in 2012, after Indian woman Savita Halappanavardied in a Galway hospital after she was refused an abortion during a miscarriage. Savita Halappanavar died after a miscarriage in University Hospital in Galway in October 2012 The following year,legislation was passedto legalise abortion when doctors deem that a woman's life is at risk due to medical complications, or at risk of taking her life. Twenty years before Mrs Halappanavar's death, a 14-year-old rape victim was initially prevented from travelling to England to terminate her pregnancy. It became known as the X Case, as the girl could not be named to protect her right to anonymity. The 1992 ban on travel was later overturned by the Irish Supreme Court. A referendum approved a further update to the constitution, stating that the eighth amendment did not restrict the freedom to travel to another state.

"Criminal gangs have smuggled tens of millions of prescription-only drugs out of the UK's protected supply chain, a BBC File on 4 programme has discovered.

"This video can not be played The duchess scored one goal, while the duke got two The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have gone head-to-head in a penalty shootout while learning about bandy hockey in Sweden's capital Stockholm. The duke scored two goals to the duchess's one after watching the 11-player game, played on a rink similar in size to a football pitch. They then went to the country's royal palace for a lunch hosted by the king, Carl XVI Gustaf. After their two-day visit to Sweden, they will travel to Norway. George and Charlotte join tour of Poland Duchess of Cambridge expecting third child Royal Family tree and line of succession Anna Widing, an international bandy player, coached the couple before the shootout. The 29-year-old said: ""I could see that maybe they like to beat each other."" The Duke and Duchess walked through Stockholm with Crown Princess Victoria and her husband Prince Daniel She said the duke had a strong shot and said she was impressed with the duchess. Ms Widing added: ""It was a privilege for us to show our sport to them."" Prince William and Catherine began their day with a hot drink from a flask carried in a case known as a bandy portfolj (bandy briefcase). The duchess, who is expecting the couple's third child, drank an alcohol-free version of the drink called glogg, which is usually mulled wine or coffee with alcohol. The Duchess of Cambridge met members of the public in Stortorget square At the king's lunch, the couple met the king and queen of Sweden and 15 other members of the royal court, including Crown Princess Victoria and her husband Prince Daniel. The princess and prince then joined the pair on a walk to Stockholm's oldest public square, Stortorget. After meeting members of the public on what is their first official visit to the Scandinavian country, the duke and duchess were then taken into the Nobel Museum for a tour. Hundreds of well-wishers turned out to see the royal couples They were given a gift by local Karin Wahlgren - a special glove for the couple to use to wipe their dog Lupo's paws when they got muddy. The duke and duchess also spoke to maths teacher Niklas Schild, who told Prince William that he was planning to travel to Windsor for Prince Harry's wedding in May. He said: ""William told me 'you'll be very welcome - it will be a very happy day'."" Catherine takes advantage of the Swedish design for a sit-down during their visit to ArkDes The game originated in Cambridgeshire and dates back to 1813. It is played outdoors on a sheet of ice the size of a football pitch - larger than an ice hockey rink - and with a ball not a puck. Like football, the game is played over 90 minutes. Under extraordinary circumstances such as heavy snowfall, the referee can choose to divide the match time in more than two parts. There are two teams, each consisting of 11 players.The full rules from the Federation of International Bandy are available online,external. It has become one of the most popular winter sports in Scandinavia, eastern Europe and the US. Sweden's women's team won this year's World Bandy Championships. The men's tournament finishes on 5 February. The couple then moved on to celebrate design at the launch of the UK-Sweden housing design exchange at the Swedish Centre for Architecture and Design or ArkDes. Ikea, whosefounder died earlier this week, was one of the companies represented at the event. The duke and duchess then revealed that they owned items of the firm's flatpack furniture, which were in Prince George and Princess Charlotte's rooms. Ikea's head of design Marcus Engman said: ""I'm proud that we can suit everybody."" Prince William then tested out his own chair as the duchess looked on The final event of the day was a black tie dinner at the residence of the British Ambassador. The couple met Swedish Prime Minister Stefan LÃ¶fven and his wife Ulla, with other guests expected to include Pirates Of The Caribbean and Thor actor Stellan Skarsgard and Ex Machina actress Alicia Vikander. The duke and duchess meet Swedish PM Stefan LÃ¶fven and his wife Sulla LÃ¶fven Prince William and Catherine will also meet academics on their trip to hear about how Sweden deals with mental health issues.

Her condition meant she had to pull out of a number of engagements last year. Jason Knauf, the Cambridges' communications secretary, said: ""The duke and duchess have asked, as with previous overseas visits, that this tour allow them opportunities to meet as many Swedes and Norwegians as possible. ""Their royal highnesses will meet a wide variety of people, including children and young people, those working in the mental health sector, and leaders in business, academia and scientific research, government, civil society and the creative industries.""

"Schools have been protesting about budget shortages Head teachers from 5,500 schools across England have signed a joint letter to Chancellor Philip Hammond warning of ""chronic"" funding shortages. It comes as a primary school in west London says it is considering cutting hours because of money problems. The heads are warning of budget gaps and unequal funding - saying schools would have an extra Â£5.5bn if they were funded at the same level as Hackney. The government has promised to move Â£1.3bn extra into school budgets. And a Department for Education spokeswoman said the heads' calculations were ""thoroughly misleading"". This is the latest stage in a campaign by head teachers, in 32 counties from Cornwall to Cumbria, pressing for higher funding for schools and a fairer distribution. They are sending an ""invoice"" to Mr Hammond for their funding shortfalls - saying this would ask for the money ""owed to the pupils and families that we serve"". Is social mobility really about levels of school funding? School funding problems in Damian Hinds' in-tray Greening moves more money into frontline for schools If all schools received the same funding as those in Westminster, another Â£3.5bn would be needed for school budgets, says the Worth Less? campaign. ""The scale of the funding differences between low-funded counties when compared to areas such as London is beyond belief,"" says Jules White, a West Sussex head who has co-ordinated the protests. ""Only additional funding will put matters right,"" says Mr White, leading a campaign which has contacted more than three-and-a-half million parents in schools which have signed up to the joint letter. The campaign says there can be a Â£2m per year difference between the incomes of secondary schools in different parts of the country. The heads have also highlighted how high levels of school funding correspond with high levels of social mobility. Among the top 20 highest funded areas in England, 18 are in London. And among the 20 places at the top of the government's social mobility index, 17 are in London. It means that Barnsley, near the bottom for social mobility, has Â£4,729 per year for each secondary pupil, while Hackney, in the top five for social mobility, receives Â£7,840. Pressures over funding have forced St. Mary's Catholic primary school in Isleworth, in the London Borough of Hounslow, to warn parents that it might have to reduce hours on Fridays from the autumn. The school has consulted with parents and told them that there have already been savings such as not filling vacant posts and reducing music lessons. There have been suggestions that parents could be asked to pay to fill the budget gap - but the school says this would mean payments of Â£400 per child. Parents have been asked to consider finding childcare arrangements for Friday afternoons. Paul Whiteman, leader of the National Association of Head Teachers, warned of the impact of funding pressures. ""It will now be impossible for many schools to avoid making redundancies, to continue to keep class sizes at an acceptable level, and to offer a full and rounded curriculum to all pupils,"" said Mr Whiteman. In the wake of the general election, where school funding had become a prominent issue, the then education secretary, Justine Greening, announced that more of the Department for Education's budget would be put directly into schools. It will mean an extra Â£1.3bn over two years being moved into school budgets. A Department for Education spokeswoman said: ""The campaign's calculations are thoroughly misleading, and ignore the fact that under our national funding formula, funding is based on the needs and characteristics of each individual school. ""There are no cuts in funding. Every school will see an increase in funding through the formula from this year, and in 2019-20 all secondary schools will attract at least Â£4,800 per pupil, and all primary schools will attract at least Â£3,500 per pupil.""

"This video can not be played Pompeo on Russia, North Korea and Trump The director of the CIA expects that Russia will target the US mid-term elections later this year. Mike Pompeo told the BBC there had been no significant diminishing of Russian attempts at subversion in Europe and the US. He also said North Korea may have the ability to strike the US with nuclear missiles ""in a handful of months"". The US intelligence community has said that it believes Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election. Mr Pompeo, who briefs the president most mornings, dismissed as ""drivel"" recent claims that US President Donald Trump was not up to the job. The director's conference room on the seventh floor of the CIA's headquarters in Langley, Virginia, is lined with pictures of former directors and the presidents they served. And Mr Pompeo is clear about his vision for the CIA under President Trump. All you need to know about Trump Russia story Mike Pompeo: America's spymaster ""We are the world's finest espionage service,"" he told the BBC. ""We are going to go out there and do our damnedest to steal secrets on behalf of the American people. And I wanted to get back on our front foot."" Donald Trump has been dogged by suspicion over his ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin A year into the job, Mr Pompeo says his mission has been to unleash and unburden the CIA. It is an agency operating in an unpredictable world - one in which intelligence assessments can be the basis not just for military action, but also political controversy. Even though there has been co-operation in counter-terrorism (the CIA helped stop a plot in St Petersburg last year), Mr Pompeo says he still sees Russia primarily as an adversary, sharing the concerns in many European countries about its subversion. ""I haven't seen a significant decrease in their activity,"" he said. Asked if his concerns extended to the upcoming US mid-term elections in November, he replied: ""Of course. I have every expectation that they will continue to try and do that, but I'm confident that America will be able to have a free and fair election [and] that we will push back in a way that is sufficiently robust that the impact they have on our election won't be great."" Mr Pompeo says his mission has been to unleash and unburden the CIA Mr Pompeo says the US is engaged in trying to counter Russian subversion. Some of this work was not the mission of the CIA such as helping people validate sources of information. But the intelligence community was involved in identifying who was behind subversive activity, using technical means to suppress it and trying to deter Russia. The Trump-Russia saga in 200 words Russia-Trump: Who's who in the drama to end all dramas? Mr Trump has been dismissive of claims of Russian interference in sharp contrast to the conclusions of the US intelligence community. So does the CIA director have to walk a fine line? ""I don't do fine lines. I do the truth,"" he responds. ""We deliver nearly every day personally to the president the most exquisite truth that we know from the CIA."" Mr Pompeo briefs Mr Trump most days when they are both in Washington DC. The briefing covers current events and strategic issues. This video can not be played Mike Pompeo told the BBC in January about his relationship with President Trump Ahead of visits abroad or meetings with foreign leaders, the briefings aim to provide the president with what is described as ""informational advantage"". ""He is very focused in the sense that he is curious about the facts that we present. He is curious in the sense he wants to understand why we believe them."" Mr Pompeo is dismissive of the portrait painted in the recent book Fire and Fury which raised questions about Mr Trump's faculties. ""It's absurd. I haven't read the book. I don't intend to,"" he says. ""The claim that the president isn't engaged and doesn't have a grasp on these important issues is dangerous and false, and it saddens me that someone would have taken the time to write such drivel."" Mr Trump's use of Twitter and frank language about foreign policy has been unprecedented, including calling Kim Jong-un ""rocket man"" and boasting about the relative size of his nuclear button. The risk posed by N Korea is uppermost in Pompeo's mind But Mr Pompeo argues such public pronouncements have helped impress upon both the North Korean leader and leaders of other countries the risks of the current situation. ""When you see this language that the president chooses to use, there are many audiences for it and... I assure you Kim Jong-un understands the message that America is serious."" Mr Pompeo said China was moving on the North Korea issue, as witnessed by recent votes at the UN, but there was still more they could do. North Korea's nuclear programme is high on the agenda. ""We talk about him having the ability to deliver nuclear weapons to the United States in a matter of a handful of months,"" Mr Pompeo says. ""Our task is to have provided the intelligence to the president of the United States that will deliver to him a set of options that continue to take down that risk by non-diplomatic means."" The president and senior officials were ""mindful"" of the fact that all-out conflict could lead to massive destruction and loss of life, Mr Pompeo said. When asked if it might be possible to remove Kim Jong-un or prevent him from being able to launch nuclear missiles, he replied: ""Many things are possible"" - but did not elaborate further on what that might mean.

"This video can not be played Pompeo on Russia, North Korea and Trump Chinese efforts to exert covert influence over the West are just as concerning as Russian subversion, the director of the CIA has said. Mike Pompeo told the BBC that the Chinese ""have a much bigger footprint"" to do this than the Russians do. As examples he cited efforts to steal US commercial information and infiltration of schools and hospitals - and this extended to Europe and the UK. Mr Pompeo was a hardline Republican congressman before becoming CIA chief. In his BBC interview, Mr Pompeo also said: He expected Russia to try to disrupt US mid-term electionsin November 2018. There had been no significant diminishing of Russian attempts at subversion in Europe and the US. North Korea may have the ability to strike the USwith nuclear missiles ""in a handful of months"" Recent claims in the book Fire and Fury that Mr Trump was not up to the job were ""drivel"". ""Think about the scale of the two economies,"" Mr Pompeo said of Russia and China. ""The Chinese have a much bigger footprint upon which to execute that mission than the Russians do."" This video can not be played CIA Director: China intent on stealing US secrets Earlier this year, a former CIA officer was arrested on charges of retaining classified information in a case thought to be connected to the dismantling of the agency's spy operations in China. In the two years before Jerry Chun Shing Lee's arrest, some 20 informants had been killed or jailed - one of the most disastrous failures of US intelligence in recent years. But officials did not know at the time whether to blame a mole or data hack. The US spy chief told the BBC that countries could collectively do more to combat Chinese efforts to exert power over the West. ""We can watch very focused efforts to steal American information, to infiltrate the United States with spies - with people who are going to work on behalf of the Chinese government against America,"" he said. ""We see it in our schools. We see it in our hospitals and medicals systems. We see it throughout corporate America. It's also true in other parts of the world... including Europe and the UK."" Gordon Corera, BBC security correspondent, CIA headquarters Russian interference has been the focus of political debate in Washington with allegations of hacking and releasing information as well as using social media to sow division. But the CIA director's surprising claim to me was that China has a more wide-ranging ability to exert influence and more needs to be done to confront it.

"The president complained that Mr McCabe's wife had received donations from ""Clinton Puppets"" The Federal Bureau of Investigation's deputy director, whom US President Donald Trump repeatedly accused of political bias, has resigned. Andrew McCabe was pressured to quit by FBI Director Christopher Wray in advance of an inspector general report examining the agency, reports CBS News. Mr McCabe was reportedly due to retire on 18 March. His exit from the top law enforcement agency comes a week after a report that Mr Trump wanted him out. An internal communication authored by Mr Wray shows Mr McCabe's early departure was the result of a forthcoming FBI inspector general report that concluded the agency must perform at the highest standards, according to CBS News. Earlier on Monday,the New York Times reported,externalthat Mr Wray had expressed an interest in moving Mr McCabe to another job, which would have been a demotion, ahead of the inspector general report. It is unclear when the report will be released. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told Monday's daily press briefing: ""This decision was not made by the White House.""

By Anthony Zurcher, BBC News Andrew McCabe had become a lightning rod for Republican criticism of the FBI's handling of the investigation into possible Trump campaign ties to Russia. Now he's heading for - or, perhaps, being pushed toward - the exits a bit earlier than he planned. Donald Trump had already been explicit in his criticism of the bureau's second-in-command during the tumultuous 2016 presidential election season. In a late December tweet,the president essentially counted the days,externaluntil Mr McCabe's planned springtime retirement. FBI Director Christopher Wray reportedly threatened to resign rather than sack his deputy director. Something changed. Perhaps the political pressure from Republicans became too much. Or maybe, as Democrats have warned, this is the beginning of a political-tinged purge of the nation's top law-enforcement agency. If there's something more concerning about Mr McCabe's tenure, beyond a Democratic-affiliated wife or his name surfacing in text messages in 2016 between two FBI employees who had been critical of Mr Trump, it's only a matter of time before it comes to light. What's clear at this point, however, is that the Russian investigation is increasingly becoming mired in partisan trench warfare - and it could directly affect how Robert Mueller's special investigation proceeds. The 'secret memo' intriguing Washington The Republican president has previously criticised Mr McCabe because his wife, Dr Jill McCabe, ran as a Democrat in a failed bid for Virginia's state senate. Her campaign received nearly $500,000 (Â£355,000) in donations from a political funding committee aligned with Hillary Clinton, Mr Trump's 2016 election rival. Mr Trump has railed against Mr McCabe and his wife on Twitter, calling the FBI chief a ""Comey friend"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The White House revolving door: Who's gone? The Washington Post reported last week that Mr McCabe was disturbed by a question he was asked by the president during a get-to-know-you Oval Office meeting. Mr Trump had reportedly asked Mr McCabewho he voted for in the 2016 US presidential election, according to current and former officials in the report. Mr McCabe said he told the president that he did not vote. The president has questioned how Mr McCabe could have handled the FBI investigation into Mrs Clinton's use of a private email server when his wife received donations from ""Clinton Puppets"". He also reportedly called Mr McCabe and demanded to know why Mr Comey was allowed to fly back on an FBI plane after he was fired in May,NBC News reported,external, citing people familiar with the phone call. During that reported phone call, the president allegedly turned on Mr McCabe and told him to ask his wife ""how it feels to be a loser"", referencing her campaign loss, according to NBC News. Recently released text messages indicate FBI officials felt Mr McCabe should have recused himself earlier from the Clinton email investigation owing to his wife's political aspirations. In a 28 October 2016 exchange, FBI agent Peter Strzok wrote to colleague Lisa Page that the bureau's chief of staff ""very clearly 100% believes that Andy should be recused because of the 'perception'"". Mr McCabe eventually did recuse himself from the Clinton probe a week before the November 2016 election. Republican-led congressional committees have launched inquiries into whether the FBI botched its Clinton investigation and showed favouritism towards her. Democrats have said those investigations are attempts to distract from US Department of Justice Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into whether Mr Trump's 2016 presidential campaign colluded with Russia.

"This video can not be played Claire had to carry her pregnancy to full term and describes her experiences The Irish government has agreed to hold a referendum at the end of May on whether to reform the country's near-total ban on abortion. The vote will decide whether to repeal a constitutional amendment that effectively bans terminations. Currently abortion is only allowed when a woman's life is at risk, but not in cases of rape, incest or fatal foetal abnormality. Prime Minister Leo Varadkar has said that he will campaign for reform. The ballot will not be on specific terms of any new law, but on whether to retain or repeal article 40.3.3 of the constitution, known as the Eighth Amendment. The amendment, which was approved by a 1983 referendum, ""acknowledges the right to life of the unborn"" - meaning the life of the woman and her unborn child are seen as equal. Tens of thousands rallied in Dublin in September for constitutional change Before the vote, the country's health minister will draft legislation proposing unrestricted abortion access be made available to women who are up to 12 weeks pregnant, and in exceptional circumstances after. An exact date for the referendum will be decided after it is debated in the Irish parliament. Campaigners have long called for the laws to be changed,and last year a special cross-party parliamentary committee and citizens assembly both recommended repealing the amendment. ""I know this will be a difficult decision for the Irish people to make,"" Mr Varadkar said. Abortion in Ireland: The fight for choice Varadkar will campaign for change ""Repeal the 8th"" mural unveiled in Dublin ""I know it is a very personal and private issue and for most of us it is not a black-and-white issue, it is one that is grey - the balance between the rights of a pregnant woman and the foetus or unborn."" Mr Varadkar, the country's former health minister who trained as a doctor, acknowledged that thousands of women in the country travelled every year for terminations or took illegal pills ordered online at home.

He said the current law meant that abortions in Ireland were ""unsafe, unregulated and illegal"". ""These journeys do not have to happen, and that can change, and that's now in our hands,"" he said. By BBC Dublin correspondent Shane Harrison The Irish government's preference is to hold the referendum in late May, during university term time, as it is expected that the majority of students will support the government. If there is a delay, polling is then most likely to happen at the start of June, when many Irish students leave the island for the summer. Irish Health Minister Simon Harris has been working with officials in his department and the attorney general on the wording of the referendum, which is expected to be formally published at the beginning of March. ""It is very important to stress any legislation to amend constitution would remain subject to review,"" said Mr Harris. ""The government does not intend to, or wish to, limit the power of our courts to interpret law. Anyone who wants any change to our regime, it is necessary to repeal the Eighth. ""This issue is not going away. It is time for the people of Ireland to have their say on that."" In 2016, 3,265 women and girls gave Republic of Ireland addresses when accessing abortion services at clinics in England and Wales,external, according to UK Department of Health statistics. The National Women's Council of Ireland (NWCI) welcomed Monday's announcement. ""Every pregnancy is different, every decision is deeply personal. Women and girls in Ireland deserve their dignity. They deserve the right to privacy, family and home,"" said the group's director Orla O'Connor. The Republic of Ireland currently has a near total ban on abortion. Terminations are not permitted in cases of rape or incest, or when there is a foetal abnormality and thousands of women travel abroad for a termination every year. The eighth amendment to the Republic's constitution, introduced in 1983, ""acknowledges the right to life of the unborn"". However, there have been significant challenges and changes to the law in recent years. A campaign to liberalise abortion gathered momentum in 2012, after Indian woman Savita Halappanavardied in a Galway hospital after she was refused an abortion during a miscarriage. Savita Halappanavar died after a miscarriage in University Hospital in Galway in October 2012 The following year,legislation was passedto legalise abortion when doctors deem that a woman's life is at risk due to medical complications, or at risk of taking her life. Twenty years before Mrs Halappanavar's death, a 14-year-old rape victim was initially prevented from travelling to England to terminate her pregnancy. It became known as the X Case, as the girl could not be named to protect her right to anonymity. The 1992 ban on travel was later overturned by the Irish Supreme Court. A referendum approved a further update to the constitution, stating that the eighth amendment did not restrict the freedom to travel to another state.

"This video can not be played Minister: There's a campaign to overturn Brexit vote The government says it will not publish a leaked report document predicting an economic hit from Brexit. Brexit Minister Steve Baker said the document was at a ""preliminary"" stage and releasing it in full could damage the UK's negotiations with the EU. According to BuzzFeed,,externalthe report said growth would be lower in each of three different Brexit outcomes than if the UK had stayed in the EU. Labour has called for it to be published and debated in Parliament. According to Buzzfeed, the leaked document, titled EU Exit Analysis - Cross Whitehall Briefing and drawn up for the Department for Exiting the EU, suggests almost every part of the economy would suffer. It looked at scenarios ranging from leaving with no deal to remaining within the EU single market. Kuenssberg: More Brexit trouble for May EU sets out Brexit transition demands Brexit: All you need to know Responding to an urgent question in the Commons, Mr Baker said the document was ""not anywhere near being approved by ministers"" and that ministers in his team had only just seen it. He described the document as a ""preliminary attempt to improve on the flawed analysis around the EU referendum"" and said it did not assess the government's preferred option of a bespoke free trade deal. It ""does not yet take account of the opportunities of leaving the EU"", he said, adding that civil service forecasts were ""always wrong, and wrong for good reasons"". Responding to calls for it to be published, Mr Baker said MPs would get as much information as possible before they vote on the final Brexit deal but said: ""We don't propose to go into these negotiations having revealed all of our thinking."" And as Brexiteer MPs hit out at the leaking of the document, he said there was ""clearly"" a campaign to overturn the 2016 EU referendum by some people in the media and the House of Commons. One Conservative MP, Antoinette Sandbach, told Mr Baker she took exception to being told it was not in the national interest for her to see the document. And responding for Labour, Brexit spokesman Sir Keir Starmer said the emergence of the report was ""piling absurdity on absurdity"" with the government having previously denied the existence of Brexit impact assessments. Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: ""For months, Theresa May's government have refused to produce any detailed analysis of the potential impact of various Brexit scenarios - now we know why they have so desperately engaged in a cover-up."" The BBC understands the Treasury contributed to the document but sources say it is part of a much wider range of work going on in Whitehall. May urged to 'see off hard Brexiteers' Reality Check: What the EU wants from transition talks The report suggests UK economic growth would be 8% lower than current forecasts, in 15 years' time, if the country left the bloc with no deal and reverted to World Trade Organisation rules. It says growth would be 5% lower if Britain negotiated a free trade deal and 2% lower even if the UK were to continue to adhere to the rules of the single market. All scenarios assume a new deal with the US. Conservative MP Philip Davies blamed the report on ""London-centric remoaners"" in the civil service ""who didn't want us to leave the European Union in the first place and put together some dodgy figures to back up their case"". Earlier Conservative MP and leave campaigner Iain Duncan Smith told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the document should be taken ""with a pinch of salt"" as almost every single forecast on Brexit has been wrong. A government source said the report ""contains a significant number of caveats and is hugely dependant on a wide range of assumptions"". The FDA, which represents senior civil servants, reacted angrily to Mr Baker's dismissal of the leaked study. ""We have just witnessed the extraordinary scene of a serving minister telling the House that, whatever analysis his own department comes up with, he simply won't believe it,"" said the union's general secretary Dave Penman. Liam Fox says some Tory colleagues must ""live with disappointment"" Meanwhile, International Trade Secretary Liam Fox has denied telling Tory Brexiteers to prepare for disappointment. Speakingto The Sun,externalabout pressure on Prime Minister Theresa May, he criticised Tory MPs involved with negative briefings, saying ""nothing that would happen would change the parliamentary arithmetic"". ""We don't have a working majority, other than with the support of the Democratic Unionists, and we need to accept the reality of that. I know that there are always disappointed individuals but they're going to have to live with disappointment."" Mr Fox told the BBC his warning was to Mrs May's critics that they will be ""disappointed"" in their efforts to topple her or secure cabinet positions for themselves.

"The European Union haslaid out its guidelines,external(known officially as supplementary directives) for the transition period after the UK formally leaves it, presumably in March next year. This is just the start of the negotiations - this is the agreed position of the other 27 member states. It's quite a dense, legalistic document, so Reality Check has pulled out some of the more important sections. This is a bit of a warning shot. The guidelines begin with several paragraphs reminding us of what's been agreed so far, and emphasise that those agreements have to be respected if further progress is to be made. One example: the EU believes there was an understanding that the transition period would maintain the status quo - in other words, all existing rules, regulations and arrangements would continue to operate. But the UK is now seeking some exceptions, and that will complicate matters. The government hopes a deal on the transition can be completed in March, but there's no guarantee that will happen. Irish border alert - don't think that you've heard the last of it. The language used in the December agreement was a fudge, and it will be difficult to translate into a legal text. Remember, the UK pledged that - if all else failed - it would maintain full alignment with those rules of the single market and the customs union that affected the border. The EU isn't sure how that can be done if the UK insists on leaving the single market and the customs union. There are various legal quirks to be found in small territories around the edges of the EU, but the challenge in Ireland is of a different scale. Creative solutions are required. This is an old favourite making yet another comeback, but it is worth highlighting again. It is one of the ""core principles"" the EU says it will apply to both transitional arrangements and the future relationship with the UK. So, during the transition, the EU will insist that freedom of movement of people should continue in full, as should UK participation in the single market and the customs union. Suggestions from London that some things could change during the transition (hence the phrase ""implementation"" period) are met with raised eyebrows and rolling eyes elsewhere on the Continent. Remember, the acquis is the set of laws, treaties and agreements that apply to all members. This one is politically difficult for the UK government, given the scale of unrest on its back benches. The EU says the UK will have to accept any new laws passed during the transition even though it will no longer have any say in making them. Brexit Secretary David Davis has pointed out it takes about two years for new legislation to make its way through the EU system, so most new laws will have been drafted while the UK was still a member state. But he also said it was important to find a mechanism for resolving concerns about any new laws the UK did not like. The opening gambit from the EU suggests there is very little wiggle room. This is a quick reminder of the official position of the other 27 member states: the UK can't actually implement new agreements with other countries during what it likes to call the implementation period, unless the EU gives a nod of approval. Spoiler: the EU won't do that for important things such as ambitious new trade deals. The government points out it will be able to negotiate and even sign trade deals during this period, but implementation will have to wait. It is a moot point anyway, because we do not know whether other countries will be willing to finalise a trade deal with the UK before they know what the future UK-EU trade relationship is going to be. This is the kicker towards the end, which is giving rise to accusations from Brexiteers that the UK will become a ""vassal state"" during transition. The UK will no longer play any formal role, or have any vote, in any of the EU institutions, even though it will be obliged to follow all EU laws. The government points out this will apply only for a strictly time-limited period, and says it is necessary to provide business with the continuity it seeks. In fact, the EU guidelines say the transition should last less than two years - ""not beyond 31 December 2020"". But many business groups worry that will not be long enough. Perhaps that's one of the reasons why an annex to these guidelines says they will be kept under review and updated as necessary.

"The choreography of leaders' foreign trips is meticulously planned It's nearly wheels-up time on the prime minister's latest big overseas adventure. Touching down in China will provide Theresa May a temporary geographic escape from her critics. But this trip is also a desperately needed chance to project authority. Like it or not, in politics the images that voters see matter, and matter a lot. So leaders often invest a lot in the art of looking important. Whether taking part in a particular local ritual, inspecting the troops, gripping and grinning as another diplomatic handshake is documented for posterity. No 10's hopes for the next few days range beyond peace and quiet without mobile phone signal on the plane. Aides to Theresa May might well enjoy that part too. May urged to 'see off' hard Brexiteers EU sets out Brexit transition demands Major effort goes into planning these voyages, the topics chosen for discussion, provocative enough to be interesting, not so controversial as to be diplomatically awkward. The photo opportunities are planned meticulously. In a moment more ridiculous than anything The Thick of It's script writers could have come up with, one former senior politician's team, whose blushes I shall spare, spent considerable powers of persuasion on a foreign visit - in other words, frantic phone calls - cajoling the driver of a golden boat to stay in position on a lake to make the backdrop of the images of their boss look good. Neither the tide, nor the language barrier, made that easy. But foreign trips are also notorious for providing opportunities for things to go wrong. Theresa May's early dash to the Trump's White House seemed such a good idea to Number 10 at the time, before the image of him grasping her hand, then his announcement of the travel ban while she was in the air. But there are always opportunities for things to go wrong By the time the No 10 team and we, the travelling press pack, landed in Ankara, shock had gone round the world and the UK had to give an answer. Theresa May's reluctance to do so may have hampered the last stage of what her team had hoped would be a triumphant trip, ending with journalists heckling her when she refused to give a full answer. Not surprisingly, by the time we landed back at Heathrow, the government had concluded it needed to clarify and a new line was emerging just as the bedraggled and exhausted lobby poured off the plane. This time, the trip begins with the Tory Party already in a distinctly grumpy mood. To send Theresa May on her way, a joint article has foundits way to The Sun,external, by three well known MPs, Nick Boles, Robert Halfon and Nicholas Soames, demanding that Number 10 ups its game and turns the screw. Their frustration is that Downing Street's plans for the country aside from Brexit aren't bold enough. It's more diplomatic than Mr Boles' recent description of some members of the government as ""boiled rabbits"", but it hardly dampens down the  perception that Theresa May is somehow falling short. And on the other side of the Tory debate, where Brexiteers have been even more rattled of late, one of their own side, Liam Fox, warning in The Sun they may have to ""live with disappointment"". (Although Mr Fox has since told the BBC he was referring to people who were plotting against Mrs May) Eurosceptic efforts to increase the pressure in the last week or so have been directed at the Cabinet as well as the prime minister, in the hope of forcing Brexiteer ministers to be more forceful in the crucial debates. Mr Fox's intervention therefore could have the opposite of its desired effect. In the next few days, Theresa May will have put physical distance between herself and her woes, but she can't hide from her party's problems. Any number of smiling, carefully choreographed photo opportunities abroad can't change the domestic backdrop. However successful any prime minister's trip might be, they eventually have to fly home.

"Anna Soubry urged the prime minister to show leadership on Brexit Theresa May has been warned the UK risks disaster unless she ""sees off hard Brexiteers"" in her own party amid continuing Tory divisions over Europe. Ex-minister Anna Soubry said the PM must not let what she said were 35 MPs dictate the terms of the UK's EU exit. No 10 says Mrs May had made progress in the negotiations and set out a ""clear vision"" of the UK's future relations. But Labour said days of infighting showed the Tories were ""incapable"" of setting out a clear position on Brexit. During an urgent question in the Commons on the second phase of Brexit talks, Sir Bill Cash urged the UK to reject the EU's guidelines for a transition period after its departure on March 29, 2019, while Philip Hollobone said the Treasury must ""get with the programme"" and accept the UK was separating itself from the EU. Downing Street has rejected calls for Chancellor Philip Hammond - who has come under fire in recent days after suggesting Brexit should result in ""very modest"" changes in EU-UK trade - to be sacked. Greening calls for return of student grants Trump 'would've done Brexit differently' Laura Kuenssberg: Tories' Brexit agonies resurface There have been rumblings among some Conservative MPs about the performance of both the chancellor and the prime minister. At a Westminster event on Monday one Conservative MP, Johnny Mercer said the ""window is closing"" for the PM to meet the challenges of leadership. This video can not be played David Lidington, minister for the Cabinet Office, says the Conservative ""family"" should think about more than Brexit And Ms Soubry - who favours the UK remaining in the customs union and single market - said Mrs May must exert her authority over the Brexit process by putting the ""interests of the economy over and above ideology"". ""When is the government going to stand up against the hard Brexiteers who mainly inhabit these benches - there's only about 35 of them - see them off, and make sure that we get a sensible Brexit, because if we don't, we will sleepwalk into a disastrous Brexit for generations to come."" Davis plays down Tory Brexit row Rees-Mogg and Hammond at odds over Brexit As the EU published its guidelines for negotiationson a transition or implementation period after the UK leaves, there have been warnings from Tory Eurosceptics that the UK will stay in the EU ""in all but name"". Sir Bill Cash said the PM must reject any outcome which saw the UK having to accept EU law during the transition period and submit to the authority of the European Court of Justice to enforce compliance. ""Given we are leaving the EU, and therefore the customs union, single market and provisions relating to free movement, is the government going to reject this new EU ultimatum,"" he said. ""Does the government reject this European Council decision as inconsistent with us leaving the European Union?"" Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, former education secretary Justine Greening said she remained a ""firm supporter"" of Mrs May and called on ""soundings off"" to stop. ""I think people need to get behind her. I think she is doing an important job for our country. We need to support her in that impossible, almost, task that she has negotiating Brexit."" During the reshuffle earlier this month, Mrs May had wanted to move Mrs Greening to the Department for Work and Pensions, but she refused and quit the government instead. Allow Twitter content?

Since her departure, Ms Greening has been accused by the PM's former adviser Nick Timothy of blocking moves to reduce tuition fees in her old job. Asked about this, Ms Greening said she had opposed a review into cutting the maximum level of fees that can be charged, suggesting this would have kicked the issue ""into the long grass"". She warned that variable tuition fees could lead to science, technology, engineering and maths degrees becoming more expensive with poorer students feeling they ought to focus on ""cheaper"" subjects. And she said it was ""wrong"" that poorer students were the main losers from the scrapping of maintenance grants. The Â£3,387 grants towards living costs were available to students from families with annual incomes of Â£25,000.

"Men working for the BBC earn an average of 9.3% more than women, a report found Women at the BBC have told MPs they faced ""veiled threats"" while trying to raise the subject of equal pay. More than 150 women have put forwardwritten evidence to the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee,,externalahead of a hearing on Wednesday. Auditors PwC have separately reviewed the pay and diversity of presenters, correspondents and on-air talent. The BBC's media editor Amol Rajan says the corporation is proposing a pay cap of Â£320,000 for its news presenters. The change, following an outcry about the size of the salaries of the BBC's highest paid stars, will only affect a handful of people but forms part of a wider restructuring of pay of on-air staff. Tuesday's announcement about on-air pay and Wednesday's committee session take place against the backdrop of a long-running debate about gender pay at the BBC, which began last summer after thecorporation published its salaries for on-air staffearning more than Â£150,000. BBC director general Tony Hall and Carrie Gracie, whoquit as the BBC's China editorover ""pay discrimination"" this month, will be questioned by the committee of MPs. The BBC's media editor says the proposed Â£320,000 cap has not yet been fully agreed or signed off and will apply only to on-air staff working full time. It will affect presenters, editors and correspondents, who will be given time to respond to the proposals. However, it is not clear whether on air-staff will be able to earn more from other BBC work, for instance on entertainment programmes. Last week,six of the BBC's leading male presenters agreed to take pay cuts. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Damian Collins, chair of the DCMS select committee, said the Â£320,000 pay cap didn't fully address his concerns. ""It actually affects a relatively small number of people,"" he said. ""If you look at the grievances that Carrie Gracie brought forward, saying she wasn't paid the same amount as other international editors at the BBC, this new proposed pay cap wouldn't have addressed that at all."" Collins also discussed the pay disparity for talent outside of news - in areas of entertainment and sport. He said: ""Many people would look at that and say, 'why is it that Gary Lineker is paid many multiples of what Clare Balding is paid?'. ""Many people would say she does a job of equal value, working on many different outlets for the BBC and covering a wide range of sports. And that's why this review must go much broader than that."" The National Union of Journalists and the BBC Women group have criticised the BBC's record on equal pay ahead of the MPs' inquiry into the issue. BBC Women, a group that represents female BBC journalists and producers, said it had ""no confidence in the on-air review"" because it had not been consulted and felt it had ""been excluded from the process"". The salaries of Chris Evans and Claudia Winkleman were among those revealed last summer ""We believe there is a wider culture of gender discrimination, which can be seen in patterns of promotion, especially after women take maternity leave."" They added: ""While individual BBC managers have been supportive there is still a bunker mentality in some quarters and women have experienced veiled threats made against them when they raised the subject of equal pay."" The group included several individual testimonies in its evidence to MPs, including one from former BBC Scotland health correspondent, Eleanor Bradford. How the BBC gender pay story unfolded Chris Evans tops list of best-paid stars Bradford said she discovered she ""was one of the lowest-paid correspondents at BBC Scotland, despite regularly appearing on UK-wide news and delivering exclusive stories"". She said she regularly asked for a pay rise and eventually was given a Â£5,000 increase but it was not backdated and she remained about Â£10,000 below some male colleagues doing exactly the same job. She subsequently left the BBC. Bradford told BBC Radio 4 Today that she felt it was an ""unconscious bias"", but there were ""efforts to change things"" during her last couple of years with the BBC. ""I do hope that there will be change, but I think nevertheless the spotlight should be shown on this because I think the change isn't happening fast enough,"" she said. Thirteen further cases have been put forward anonymously. They include: A TV news presenter who said she ""had been sitting next to a man doing an identical job who was being paid tens of thousands of pounds more...  I am told that we are now being paid at the same rate per day, but there is no transparency"" A BBC reporter who found her full time equivalent salary for making identical programmes was about half her male counterpart A sports broadcaster who has worked for the BBC for almost 30 years, both as staff and freelance, who found her Â£500 pay on a flagship radio programme was less than half of the male presenter A regional news presenter who after becoming aware that her male colleague's salary was a third more than the figure she had been offered was given a 5% increase An award-winning broadcaster on a flagship arts programme said she found her male colleague was being paid 50% more per show. ""When I asked for (the) pay gap to be corrected the line manager told me 'the BBC doesn't do equal pay', and that in raising the issue I was being 'aggressive'. I refused to back down and eventually was given the same rate as my male colleague and it was backdated"". A BBC spokesperson said: ""We look forward to an informed debate at the select committee based on all the facts. ""The BBC is committed to equal pay, and we don't accept the assertion we have not been complying with the Equality Act, nor do we offer inferior contracts based on someone's gender or race. Nicky Campbell, Huw Edwards, Jon Sopel, Jeremy Vine, Nick Robinson and John Humphrys are to take pay cuts ""We want to help women progress in their career and have set out ambitious targets to close the gender pay gap, filled by women. We've also set out action to achieve them. ""We have already set out how we plan to deliver real pay transparency for our staff, and today we'll publish proposals to significantly change how we manage on-air pay so we have a clear, transparent and fair system for the future."" The spokesperson added that the corporation would ""not getting in to debates at the moment on pay band levels"". Damian Collins MP, chair of the DCMS committee, said that the complaints from the BBC Women group and the NUJ included those about ""unlawful pay disparities on grounds of race, discrimination against women returning to work after periods of maternity leave, and discrimination against part-time workers and/or those who request flexible working"". A report published in October foundmen working for the BBC earn an average of 9.3% more than women. The figure covered all staff, on and off air, and was put down to the fact there are more men in senior jobs. It compares with a UK average of 18%, and BBC director general Tony Hall said it showed the BBC was ""in a better place than many organisations"".
