"An Atlantic storm, which is due to hit parts of the UK and the Republic of Ireland this weekend, has been named Brian, the Irish Met office has said. The Met Office has issued a yellow warning for strong winds and potential flooding in parts of southern and western England and Wales on Saturday. Met Ãireann issued an orange warning, of potentially ""significant"" impact, for parts of the Irish Republic. It is the second named storm to hit the UK this winter, after Storm Aileen. The storm - which could bring gusts of wind of up to 70mph (112kmph) - is likely to hit parts of south-west Ireland in the early hours of Saturday morning. It is then forecast to affect parts of southern England and southern and western Wales later in the morning. The Met Office's warning is in place from 04:00 BST (03:00 GMT) on Saturday. Warning of heavy rain in Northern Ireland It warned some coastal areas in the UK could be affected by large waves, with the potential for flooding. Some transport disruption was ""likely"", with delays to road, rail, air and ferry transport all possible, the warning added. Short term loss of power and other services is also possible, it said. The Met Office's chief forecaster Dan Suri said the worst of the storm was likely to be felt in Ireland. ""At the moment, we don't expect the same level of impacts for the UK,"" he said. ""Gusts exceeding 50mph are expected widely within the warning area, with gusts of around 70mph along exposed coastal areas. These are expected to coincide with high tides, leading to locally dangerous conditions in coastal parts."" The Met Office said it currently has no plans to issue an amber warning for any part of the UK, but the situation was ""under continual review"". Met Ãireann said there was a risk of coastal flooding in some areas of the Irish Republic. Under storm naming guidelines, the Met Office and its partner agency Met Ãireann name any storm with an amber - or orange - wind warning. A storm - the tail end of Hurricane Ophelia which travelled across the Atlantic Ocean from the Azores - caused significant damage to the Republic of Ireland, Scotland and north Wales last week. The Met Office and Met Ãireann do not rename the remnants of storms that have moved across the Atlantic, if they have already been named. On Monday, three people in Ireland died in the storm. Thousands of people were also left without water and power.

"Champagne or sparkling wine? A Canadian man has filed a lawsuit against Sunwing Airlines for promising a champagne service and instead serving sparkling wine. Daniel Macduff booked a holiday to Cuba through Sunwing that advertised a complimentary on-board champagne toast. Mr Macduff, from Quebec, said he received a cheaper bubbly instead - and only on the outgoing flight. The airline said it believes the lawsuit ""to be frivolous and without merit"". Mr Macduff's lawyer says the class action hinges on misleading marketing and not the quality of the wine served. ""It's not about the pettiness of champagne versus sparkling wine,"" said Montreal-based lawyer SÃ©bastien Paquette. ""It's the consumer message behind it."" Mr Paquette said references to real champagne - a sparkling wine variety made specifically in the Champagne region in France - was front and centre in Sunwing's marketing materials. Why women are picking prosecco over champagne Theresa May 'quit' stories blamed on 'warm prosecco' In an emailed statement, Sunwing said the terms ""champagne vacations"" and ""champagne service"" were used ""to denote a level of service in reference to the entire hospitality package"" and not to describe the in-flight beverages. The airline says it still offers sparkling wine to all its passengers on flights to southern vacation destinations, but are no longer referencing ""champagne service"" in active marketing campaigns. Sunwing said it has always described these services as including ""a complimentary welcome glass of sparkling wine"" and announce it as such on the aircraft. The airline added the inflight service has been ""consistently been well-received by customers"". The class action has yet to be certified by the courts, but seeks compensation for the monetary difference between the actual wine served and a glass of champagne as well as punitive damages. Mr Paquette said about 1,600 other plaintiffs have come forward in Quebec to join the lawsuit.

"Lancaster said she didn't feel she could tell her parents at the time Model Penny Lancaster has said she was sexually assaulted as a teenager by someone she worked for. Lancaster, who is married to rock singer Rod Stewart, told ITV's Loose Women that she had her drink spiked. She said she found herself being attacked on a bed and ""can't remember much of what happened"". ""I just know he was on top of me and enjoying the experience but I certainly wasn't. I don't really remember much more. I was too afraid to tell anyone."" Lancaster, now 46, said she had been a virgin at the time of the assault, which she said happened after she went to the house of a man who had promised to take her to an event where she could make work contacts. ""I was like, 'Oh, someone will be interested, I might get some more work,'"" Lancaster said. ""So I went with him. And he said: 'Oh, I have to stop at my apartment.'"" She said he gave her a drink ""and unfortunately the next thing I knew... I found myself face down on a bed with him on top of me"". The model, who was in tears as she spoke, said: ""I couldn't tell my mum and dad because I thought they would be saying to me, 'What on earth were you doing going back to his house?' ""But he was a guy that I had worked with and he promised me to meet other people and so I was naive and I trusted him."" She said she wanted to speak out so young girls in a similar situation could understand it was ""not their fault"". ""They are not guilty. The other person is. And they need to be brave enough to tell the authorities."" Lancaster was speaking out during a discussion on the chat show about the #MeToo campaign social media started by survivors of sexual harassment and assault, which followed the recent allegations about Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein. Mr Weinstein ""unequivocally denies"" allegations of sexual assault, harassment and rape. Follow us onFacebook,external, on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external, or on Instagram atbbcnewsents,external.

"British scientists have worked out how many changes it takes to transform a healthy cell into a cancer. The team, at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, showed the answer was a tiny handful, between one and 10 mutations depending on the type of tumour. It has been one of the most hotly debated issues in cancer science for decades. The findings, published in the journal Cell, could improve treatment for patients. If you played spot the difference between a cancer and healthy tissue, you could find tens of thousands of differences - or mutations - in the DNA. Some are driving the cancer's growth, while others are just along for the ride. So which ones are important? The researchers analysed the DNA from 7,664 tumours to find ""driver mutations"" that allow a cell to be more selfish, aggressive and cancerous. They showed it could take: just one mutation to drive thyroid and testicular cancers four mutations to make a breast or liver cancer 10 mutations to create a colorectal cancer. Dr Peter Campbell, one of the researchers, told the BBC News website: ""We've known about the genetic basis of cancer for many decades now, but how many mutations are responsible has been incredibly hotly debated. ""What we've been able to do in this study is really provide the first unbiased numbers. ""And it seems that of the thousands of mutations in a cancer genome, only a small handful are responsible for dictating the way the cell behaves, what makes it cancerous."" Half the mutations identified were in sets of genetic instructions - or genes - that had never been implicated in cancer before. The long-term goal is to advance precision cancer treatment. If doctors know which few mutations, out of thousands, were driving a patient's cancer, it could allow drugs that specifically targeted that mutation to be used. Drugs such asherceptin,externalandBraf inhibitors,externalare already used to attack specific mutations in tumours. The researchers were able to pick out the mutations that were driving the growth of cancer by turning to Charles Darwin and evolutionary theory. In essence, driver mutations should appear more often in tumours than ""neutral"" mutations that do not make the cell cancerous. This is becausethe forces of natural selection,externalgive an evolutionary advantage to mutations that help a cell grow and divide more readily. Dr Nicholas McGranahan, from the Cancer Research UK and the UCL Cancer Institute, said the approach was ""elegant"". He said: ""Cancer is a disease that evolves and changes over time, and it makes sense to use ideas like this from species evolution to work out the genetic faults that cause cancer to grow. ""But as this study focuses on one part of cancer evolution, it can only give us insight into part of the puzzle. ""Other components such as how DNA is packaged into chromosomes are also key in how a tumour progresses and will need to be looked at to give us a clearer picture of how cancer evolves.""

"This video can not be played Kelly defends Trump's call to widow The White House chief of staff has launched an impassioned attack on a ""selfish"" congresswoman who said President Trump made a war widow cry. General John Kelly said he was ""broken-hearted"" by the Democrat's criticism of the president's condolence call to Sgt La David Johnson's wife. Sgt Johnson was one of four killed in Niger by Islamist militants this month. Gen Kelly also said he did not receive a call from President Barack Obama when his son died in Afghanistan in 2010. Trump sends cheque after family complains The chief of staff, a former Marine Corps general, said in the White House briefing room that Representative Frederica Wilson was ""an empty barrel"". Sgt Johnson's widow with his coffin at Miami International Airport The Florida Democrat said on Wednesday that she had overheard Mr Trump telling bereaved Myeshia Johnson of her slain husband: ""He knew what he was signing up for, but I guess it hurts anyway."" Ms Wilson said the president's alleged remarks, shortly before Sgt Johnson's coffin arrived by aircraft in his home city of Miami, made Ms Johnson break down in tears. President Trump said the congresswoman had ""totally fabricated"" the comments, but the soldier's motherlater backed up Ms Wilson, saying he had disrespected the family. On Thursday, Gen Kelly said he was so ""stunned"" by Ms Wilson's attack that he spent more than an hour walking among soldiers' graves at Arlington National Cemetery, just outside Washington. This video can not be played Congresswoman Frederica Wilson: ""How insensitive can you be?"" The chief of staff said he had advised the president not to call the loved ones of the four American servicemen killed in Niger, telling him: ""There's nothing you can do to lighten the burden on these families."" Gen Kelly described such a task as ""the most difficult thing you can imagine"". ""There is no perfect way to make that phone call,"" he added. Five reasons Trump's widow story stings He also discussed the death of his own son, Robert Kelly, a 29-year-old Marine first lieutenant who died when he stepped on an Afghan landmine. Gen Kelly said: ""He [President Trump] asked me about previous presidents. And I said, 'I can tell you that President Obama, who was my commander-in-chief when I was on active duty, did not call my family.' This video can not be played Gold Star Mother Christina Ayube: ""We don't need to be reminded of that on the way to receiving the body"" ""That was not a criticism. That was just to simply say, I don't believe that President Obama called. That's not a negative thing. ""I don't believe President Bush called in all cases. I don't believe any president, particularly when the casualty rates are very, very high, that presidents call."" The controversy began on Monday when a reporter asked Mr Trump at the White House why he had still not called the families of the four soldiers killed in the fatal ambush in Niger on 4 October. The president provoked outrage by suggesting that his predecessor, Barack Obama, and other former US presidents did not call the relatives of dead service members. On Tuesday, Mr Trump ratcheted up the row by stating that President Obama did not call Gen Kelly's family. Mr Kelly also said the Pentagon was investigating the details of the deaths of Sgt Johnson and the other servicemen in the west African country. But Senator John McCain, the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said he was not being given any details, adding that he could issue a subpoena for the information. Asked by reporters what information he still lacked, he said ""everything"". And asked if the White house had been forthcoming, he responded: ""Of course not.""

"Reports of deadlock over Brexit negotiations may have been exaggerated, European Council President Donald Tusk has said after a Brussels summit. Progress was ""not sufficient"" to begin trade talks with the UK now but that ""doesn't mean there is no progress at all"", he said. EU leaders will discuss the issue internally, paving the way for talks with the UK, possibly in December. Theresa May said there was ""some way to go"" but she was ""optimistic"". Speaking at the end of a two-day summit, Mr Tusk told reporters: ""My impression is that the reports of the deadlock between the EU and the UK have been exaggerated."" Reality Check: How are the Brexit talks actually going? Tell EU you'll walk away, Eurosceptics tell May Brexit: How do other EU countries see a 'no deal'? The EU's chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier,described the talks as deadlockedearlier this month. Mr Tusk said he was not at odds with Mr Barnier, but his own role was to be a ""positive motivator for the next five or six weeks"". He said he felt there was ""goodwill"" on both sides ""and this is why I, maybe, in my rhetoric, I'm, maybe, a little bit more optimistic than Michel Barnier, but we are also in a different role"". The so-called divorce bill remains a major sticking point in talks with the EU. French President Emmanuel Macron said there was still much work to be done on the financial commitment before trade talks can begin, adding: ""We are not halfway there."" Theresa May declined to say in a press conference after the summit what the UK would be prepared to pay, saying the ""final settlement"" would come as part of a ""final agreement"" with the EU. The UK prime minister did not name any figures but refused to deny that she had told other EU leaders the UK could pay many more billions of pounds than the Â£20bn she had indicated in her Florence speech last month. ""I have said that ... we will honour the commitments that we have made during our membership,"" she said. But those commitments were being analysed ""line by line"" she said, adding: ""British taxpayer wouldn't expect its government to do anything else."" This video can not be played Three key points about how the Brexit talks are going By Laura Kuenssberg, BBC political editor There are whispers that Theresa May has privately reassured the other leaders that she is willing to put a lot more than the implicit 20 billion euros (Â£17.8bn) on the table as we leave. Number 10 doesn't deny this, Mrs May didn't deny it when we asked her in the press conference today, nor did she reject the idea that the bill could be as high as 60 billion euros. If she has actually given those private reassurances though, there's not much evidence the other EU leaders believe her or think it's enough. But if she is to make that case more forcefully she has big political problems at home. Read Laura's blog She said the two sides were within ""touching distance"" of a deal on other issues - particularly on citizens' rights. ""I am ambitious and positive for Britain's future and for these negotiations but I know we still have some way to go,"" she said. The UK is due to leave the EU in March 2019, following last year's referendum result. It had hoped to move onto phase two of negotiations - covering future trade arrangements - after this week's summit. But EU leaders took just 90 seconds to officially conclude that not enough progress has been made on the issues of citizens' rights, the UK's financial obligation and the border in Northern Ireland, but ""internal preparations"" would begin for phase two. The prime minister made a personal appeal to her 27 EU counterparts at a working dinner on Thursday night, telling them that ""we must work together to get to an outcome that we can stand behind and defend to our people"". BBC Europe editor Katya Adler said all EU leaders knew Mrs May was in a politically difficult situation and did not want her to go home empty-handed, so had promised they would start talking about trade and transition deals among themselves, as early as Monday. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said there were ""encouraging"" signs of progress in Brexit negotiations and the process was progressing ""step by step"". And European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said he hoped it would be possible to reach a ""fair deal"" with Britain. ""Our working assumption is not the 'no-deal' scenario. I hate the 'no-deal' scenario. I don't know what that means,"" he said.

"Head teacher Aydin Onac has been suspended by the high-achieving grammar school The grammar school head teacher at the centre of a row about pupils not being allowed to stay on to take A-levels has been suspended. Aydin Onac, head of St Olave's in Orpington, has been suspended by the school's governors. Parents had threatened legal action after some pupils were told to leave the school before the upper sixth year. It raised questions about schools boosting their league table rankings by restricting who could take A-levels. St Olave's, in the London borough of Bromley, is one of England's top-performing grammar schools. But in August it was caught up in a high-profile dispute when some of its pupils were told they would not be re-admitted for their final year. Parents began legal proceedings that claimed that removing pupils between Year 12 and 13 - the lower and upper sixth - would have been a form of unlawful exclusion. Grammar school legal battle over A-level places dispute Is it fair to kick out pupils half way through sixth form? The parents challenged whether the school could stop pupils returning because of their expected A-level grades. St Olave's reversed its decision and allowed the pupils to return for upper sixth - and the planned court hearing did not take place. But the school's governors have now decided that the head teacher, Mr Onac, should be suspended. The governors say that the local authority is carrying out its own investigation into the A-level controversy. St Olave's was at the centre of a controversy over pupils being removed from the school before A-levels The St Olave's dispute began a wider debate about whether schools should be able to stop pupils progressing in this way - and whether filtering out academically-weaker pupils ahead of exams was being used to artificially boost results and league table rankings. Other schools were forced to review their procedures on whether to allow pupils to continue into the final year of A-levels. A statement from the chair of governors, Dr Paul Wright, said: ""I have been informed that the London Borough of Bromley will be conducting an investigation of St Olave's Grammar School in respect of concerns that have been raised over recent weeks. ""In light of this, and in order to protect the integrity of the investigation, Mr Onac has been suspended from all of his responsibilities as headmaster of the school."" ""Please remember that this suspension is without prejudice and does not presume any particular outcome.  We are committed to full transparency and will be co-operating fully with the local authority in this matter."" Bromley Council confirmed ""that there will be an investigation into concerns raised"". This year's A-level results at St Olave's saw 75% of all grades being awarded at A* or A and 96% were at A* to B grades, far above the national average.

"Some PCSOs will take on new roles within the force A police force could be the first to axe all of its community support officers amid falling budgets and an ""unparalleled growth in complex crime"". Norfolk Constabulary will scrap 150 PCSOs if its proposals are approved. Chief Constable Simon Bailey said ""an average police constable"" costs only slightly more to employ and would be more useful in ""high risk, high harm"" cases. Unison official Caren Reeves said it was ""a life-altering day"" for Norfolk. Excluding PCSOs, Norfolk Police employs 1,462 officers and 1,065 civilians The news comes as the Office for National Statistics said the numbers of crimes recorded annuallyin England and Wales had risen by 13%. With the Â£1.6m saved by ditching PCSOs, the chief constable is proposing to appoint an extra 81 officers and 16 staff members. Seven front counter services and seven police stations would also be shut under the plans. Mr Bailey said the ""radical"" measures came at a time when the police service was facing ""unparalleled growth in complex crime"" alongside ""reduced policing budgets"". He said the force had seen a large increase over the past three years of serious crimes such as ""rape, sexual offences, adult and child abuse, indecent images, drugs and serious violence as well as cyber crime"". He said they were ""high risk, high harm"" cases and needed ""a workforce that is able to deal with that"". Mr Bailey added: ""When you compare the cost of a PCSO, and the average cost of a PC, there's only a difference of Â£1,800. ""Police officers are fully flexible, fully warranted powers, and I'm able to do a lot more with them than I am with my PCSOs, so it's a tough decision."" PCSOs were first introduced in England and Wales in 2002 to tackle the fear of crime and provide back-up to forces. They do not have powers of arrest, cannot interview prisoners or carry out the high-risk tasks of police officers. They can give someone a fixed-penalty notice, for instance for littering, demand the name and address of someone accused of being anti-social, and take alcohol off a person aged under 18. They can also provide support at special events, direct traffic and make house-to-house inquiries. Some critics of the role havepreviously described them as ""plastic policemen""because they do not have as many powers as PCs. The number of PCSOs in England and Wales has been in decline since 2010, when there were 16,918. By March 2017 there were 10,213. Norfolk has seen one of the biggest declines in PCSOs, a fall of 46%, from 275 in 2010, to 149 as of March 2017, but it is Essex that has seen the biggest drop, down 78% from 445 to 96. London's two forces, the Metropolitan Police and City of London Police, saw a combined fall of 69%. The Home Office figures are ""full-time equivalent"" and will count two or more part time PCSOs as one full time officer. This comes alongside a decline in the number of police officers from 144,273 in 2009 to 123,507 in 2017. Ms Reeves, branch secretary of Norfolk Police Union, said: ""I believe these losses are a direct result of the ongoing unreasonable and insurmountable government cuts to police budgets. ""Not only is this a life-altering day for my members, my colleagues and their families, but also for the good people of Norfolk and the visitors to our safe and beautiful county."" Chairman of the Police Federation, Andy Symonds, said he feared thePCSO workloadwould transfer to officers left behind and there would also be an impact from the length of time it took to train a police officer. There will now be a 45-day formal staff consultation on the proposals.

"Spain's PM Mariano Rajoy is with other EU leaders - including France's Emmanuel Macron (L) - at a major summit European Council President Donald Tusk has explicitly ruled out any EU action over Catalonia, despite the ""concerning"" situation. ""There is no room, no space for any kind of mediation or international initiative or action,"" he said. He was speaking at a joint news conference with EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker. A referendum outlawed by Spain was held on 1 October. Of the 43% who voted, 90% were in favour of independence. Mr Tusk's remarks came hours after Spain said it was beginning the process of imposing direct rule on the autonomous region. ""I am of course for many reasons in permanent contact with (Spain's) Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy,"" Mr Tusk said. ""There is no hiding that the situation in Spain is concerning, but our position... is clear."" Cases for and against independence Catalan crisis in 300 words Reality Check: Would Catalonia be a viable country? He was speaking ahead of an EU Council summit, but said the issue of Catalonia was ""not in our agenda"". Other European leaders, including Germany's Angela Merkel and France's Emmanuel Macron, also threw their support behind Madrid. Meanwhile, Russian President Vladimir Putin said the crisis exposed Western hypocrisy, which backs some separatist movements but not others. He argued that Western nations had supported the independence of Kosovo from Serbia - a Russian ally - but not Catalonia or for Iraqi Kurdistan. He also raised the opposition of many nations to Russia's annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014, which resulted in international sanctions against Russia. Katya Adler: A slow, dangerous game of political chess Spain said it would begin the process of imposing direct rule on Saturday by activating article 155 of the country's constitution. But Catalonia's leader said the region's parliament would vote to formally declare its independence if Spain continued ""repression"". Some fear the latest moves could spark further unrest after mass demonstrations before and since the ballot on 1 October. Spain's supreme court declared the vote illegal and said it violated the constitution, which describes the country as indivisible. In Barcelona, many attended a candle-lit demonstration following the arrest of two separatist leaders Article 155 of the constitution, which cemented democratic rule three years after the death of dictator General Francisco Franco in 1975, allows Madrid to impose direct rule in a crisis but it has never been invoked. But the Spanish government now says it will begin the procedure on Saturday. ""No-one doubts that the Spanish government will do all it can to restore the constitutional order,"" a government statement said. The man who wants to break up Spain Catalonia crisis: A slow, dangerous game of political chess On Saturday, the government is due to decide a list of specific measures to transfer powers from Catalonia to Madrid. The extent of those measures is not yet clear - but could include taking control of the regional police, or even calling a snap election. Xavier ArbÃ³s, a constitutional expert at the University of Barcelona, said: ""We simply do not know what measures the Spanish government could enact. ""We do not know how the powers of the Catalan government could be affected."" Catalan flags were shown by many of the crowd at Barcelona's home football match on Wednesday Spain's Senate, controlled by Mr Rajoy's conservative Popular Party (PP) and its allies, would then have to approve the list. Analysts say Article 155 does not give the government the power to fully suspend autonomy, and it will not be able to deviate from the list of measures. After the 1 October vote, Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont signed a declaration of independence, but immediately suspended it to allow for talks. He has warned the suspended status could change. Carles Puigdemont (L) is facing off with Mariano Rajoy (R) ""The Catalan parliament could proceed, if it is considered opportune, to vote on a formal declaration of independence,"" he said. But if Madrid takes control of the region's finances or police force, or dissolves the Catalan regional parliament, such a vote would be a challenge. The constitution does not put any time limit on the process, however. Catalan views: Unionists v separatists Would Catalonia be a viable country? Do Catalans want to leave Spain?

"There are fears that the latest moves could lead to unrest in Catalonia Spain is to start suspending Catalonia's autonomy from Saturday, as the region's leader threatens to declare independence. The government said ministers would meet to activate Article 155 of the constitution, allowing it to take over running of the region. Catalonia's leader said the region's parliament would vote on independence if Spain continued ""repression"". A referendum outlawed by Spain was held earlier this month.

Article 155 of the constitution, which cemented democratic rule three years after the death of dictator General Francisco Franco in 1975, allows Madrid to impose direct rule in a crisis but it has never been invoked. BBC Madrid correspondent Tom Burridge says that for Madrid this is about upholding the rule of law in Catalonia, protecting the Spanish constitution and disciplining what it sees as an unruly, disobedient devolved government. However, the central government wants to minimise the risk of large-scale demonstrations, our correspondent says. Civil servants and government lawyers have thought long and hard about what measures to adopt and when and how they should be implemented. Cases for and against independence Catalan crisis in 300 words Reality Check: Would Catalonia be a viable country? By Katya Adler, BBC Europe editor The Catalan crisis is reaching breaking point but we have to be careful here. Nothing will happen from one day to the next. Political rhetoric aside, both the Spanish government and Catalan regional leaders know sentiments are running so high across Spain at the moment, that millions are poised to take to the streets. Once the shopping list of measures has been decided, the Catalan leader has the right of reply and we're told there is no legal window of opportunity for him to do so, meaning this could take days or weeks. Finally, the Spanish Senate needs to approve the measures. Read more from Katya Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy had set a deadline of 10:00 local time (08:00 GMT) for Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont to offer a definitive answer on the independence question, and called on him to ""act sensibly"". The man who wants to break up Spain When it passed, the Spanish government accused the Catalan authorities of seeking confrontation. ""The Spanish government will continue with the procedures outlined in Article 155 of the Constitution to restore legality in Catalonia's self-government,"" it said. This video can not be played Why is there a Catalan crisis? The answer is in its past, as Europe correspondent Gavin Lee explains ""It denounces the attitude maintained by those in charge of the Generalitat [Catalan government] to seek, deliberately and systematically, institutional confrontation despite the serious damage that is being caused to the coexistence and the economic structure of Catalonia. ""No-one doubts that the Spanish government will do all it can to restore the constitutional order."" Mr Rajoy is currently attending an EU summit in Brussels. The president of the European Council, Donald Tusk, says there is no space for any international mediation or EU action on the Catalan crisis - though he did say there was ""no hiding that the situation in Spain is concerning"". On Saturday the government will be expected to draw up a list of specific measures under Article 155 ofthe constitution,external, launching the transfer of powers from Catalonia to Madrid. This video can not be played Catalonia independence and some of Europe's border changes The article says: ""If a self-governing community does not fulfil the obligations imposed upon it by the constitution or other laws, or acts in a way that is seriously prejudicial to the general interest of Spain, the government... may... take all measures necessary to compel the community to meet said obligations, or to protect the above-mentioned general interest."" It is thought the measures implemented could range from taking control of the regional police and finances to calling a snap election. Spain's Senate, controlled by Mr Rajoy's conservative Popular Party (PP) and its allies, would then have to approve the list. Analysts say Article 155 does not give the government the power to fully suspend autonomy, and it will not be able to deviate from the list of measures. And Xavier ArbÃ³s, a constitutional expert at the University of Barcelona, said the situation was moving into ""uncharted territory"". He told the BBC: ""We simply do not know what measures the Spanish government could enact. We do not know how the powers of the Catalan government could be affected."" Where does this leave the Catalan leader? Mr Puigdemont said in a letter to Mr Rajoy on Thursday morning that the independence declaration remained suspended but this could change. ""If the government continues to impede dialogue and continues with the repression, the Catalan parliament could proceed, if it is considered opportune, to vote on a formal declaration of independence."" But he faces an uphill struggle - it is likely that senior figures in charge of internal security in Catalonia could be dismissed, and control of the region's police force could pass to Madrid. The regional parliament could also be dissolved. Tough choices: How will Carles Puigdemont (L) answer Mariano Rajoy's ultimatum? One Spanish newspaper has reported that Mr Puigdemont might nominally remain in his job but Madrid would aim to take control of many of his duties and powers. Ultimately the process could end in regional elections but the Spanish constitution does not impose any time limit. Catalan views: Unionists v separatists Would Catalonia be a viable country?

"This video can not be played Theresa May: I want 'urgency' on citizens' deal EU leaders have urged Theresa May to do more to break the deadlock in the Brexit negotiations as they gather at a crunch Brussels summit. Dutch PM Mark Rutte said ""a lot more clarity"" on the UK's financial offer was needed before talks could progress. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said there were ""encouraging"" signs but that progress so far was ""not sufficient"" to open trade talks. However, Mrs Merkel suggested this could happen in December. Reality Check: How are the Brexit talks actually going? Goldman chief hints at Frankfurt move No deal? The view from the Europeans Tell EU you'll walk away, Eurosceptics tell May Mrs May, who has called for ""urgency"" in reaching agreement on the issue of citizens' rights, will address EU leaders at the summit later. At a meeting on Friday, at which the UK will not be present, the 27 leaders are expected to conclude officially that ""insufficient progress"" has been made on the first topics for discussion to move onto the second phase of trade discussions. These topics are citizens' rights, the UK's financial obligation and the border in Northern Ireland. The UK prime minister spoke of her desire for a future partnership with the EU as she arrived in Brussels, but added: ""We'll also be looking at the concrete progress that has been made in our exit negotiations and setting out ambitious plans for the weeks ahead. This video can not be played Dutch PM Mark Rutte: More details needed from UK ""I particularly, for example, want to see an urgency in reaching an agreement on citizens' rights."" Speaking to the BBC, Mr Rutte said he welcomed the PM's recent speech in Florence, where she set out what she has described as a ""bold and ambitious agenda"". But he said she needed to make ""absolutely clear"" what she was offering to do in relationship to the UK's financial obligations towards the EU. ""Maybe it's not possible now to name a number but at least to come up with a methodology, a system, a complete proposal to solve this issue,"" he said. ""As long as that is not happening I don't see how we can move forward."" Theresa May chatted to German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron at the EU summit Analysis by Europe correspondent Kevin Connolly The October summit was always the first date in the EU calendar on which a gathering of the 27 heads of government could declare themselves satisfied with the Brexit divorce negotiations and agree to start talking about trade. It's been clear for weeks that they won't do that - but they will offer the UK some encouragement by starting internal discussions about future trade with the UK - ready for any breakthrough at the next summit in December. Theresa May isn't expected to make any big new proposal in her after-dinner remarks but to underline the quality of the financial offer made in her speech in Florence - worth around Â£20bn. The EU side wants more though - more money as well as further movement on citizens rights and the Irish border. There are almost as many predictions about what happens next as there are diplomats in Brussels; one has suggested that the prospects of a December breakthrough are no better than fifty-fifty but an official close to the talks said the signal on Brexit from this summit would be fundamentally positive. Kuenssberg: Whiff of foreboding about Brexit talks Before leaving for Brussels, Mrs May used aFacebook,externalpost to offer further assurances to the three million or so nationals of other EU countries living in the UK and uncertain about their future after Brexit. In the open letter, which was also mailed to 100,000 EU nationals, she said those who already had permanent residence would be able to ""swap this"" for settled status in as hassle-free a way as possible. The process of applying for permanent residency, for which EU nationals are eligible after five years, has long been criticised as cumbersome and overly bureaucratic. At one point, it involved filling out an 85-page form. Theresa May says the future of British and EU nationals has always been her ""first priority"" In simplifying it, Mrs May said she was committed to putting ""people first"" in the negotiations and expected British nationals living on the continent to be treated in the same way. ""I know both sides will consider each other's proposals with an open mind and with flexibility and creativity on both sides, I am confident we can conclude discussions on citizens' rights in the coming weeks,"" she said. Nicolas Hatton, of the 3million pressure group formed to fight for the rights of EU nationals in the UK, described the PM's statement as ""very positive"", but said its timing was ""a bit more dubious"". ""We should have received that letter maybe 12 months ago so we would not have felt so anxious about our future"" he said, adding: ""I think the letter was actually addressed to EU leaders."" This video can not be played Vince Cable on progress of UK-EU Brexit talks This video can not be played Thornberry: Labour will not accept a no-deal Brexit Meanwhile a group of pro-Brexit Tory and Labour politicians - including former Chancellor Lord Lawson, former Conservative minister Owen Paterson and Labour MP Kate Hoey - is urging Mrs May to walk away from negotiations this week if the EU does not accommodate the UK's wishes. In the event of no progress at Thursday's meeting, the letter, organised by the Leave Means Leave campaign, says Mrs May should formally declare the UK is working on the assumption it will be reverting to World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules on 30 March 2019. Creative sector warns of Brexit threat Brexit: All you need to know 'More delays' to key Brexit bill Mr Paterson told the Today programme the UK should not be ""terrified"" of leaving the EU without a deal in place, saying this appeared ""inevitable at the moment"" due to the EU's ""complete obsession with money"" - the so-called Brexit divorce bill. But Labour's Brexit spokesman, Sir Keir Starmer, said it would be ""irresponsible"" to threaten to walk away with the talks only at ""phase one"". He added that Labour was not ""duty bound"" to support any deal the PM secures with Brussels. Sir Keir and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn are also in Brussels for their own talks with EU officials.

"Cpl Dillon Baldridge was killed over the summer by a rogue Afghan commander he had been training The White House says President Donald Trump has sent a personal cheque to a dead soldier's family after they said he had not kept his promise to do so. The father of a soldier killed in Afghanistan said Mr Trump offered $25,000 (Â£19,000) of his own money during a June phone call. The White House said it was ""disgusting"" that the media would exploit the issue. The dispute came as Mr Trump denied being insensitive to a war widow. Five reasons Trump's war widow story stings On Wednesday, the president rejected a claim that he had told the wife of a soldier killed in Niger this monthher husband knew what he signed up for. Proud father Chris Baldridge with his son, Dillon (R) Later that day,the Washington Post reported,externalon a phone call that bereaved father Chris Baldridge said he had received from the president. His 22-year-old son Cpl Dillon Baldridge was killed over the summer by a rogue Afghan commander he had been training. Mr Baldridge said that during the call he vented frustration to Mr Trump about a US military survivor benefits programme. To his surprise, he said, the president offered to send a personal cheque and set up an online fundraiser. But the family told the Post they are still waiting for the money. This video can not be played Congresswoman Frederica Wilson: ""How insensitive can you be?"" ""I was just floored,"" said Mr Baldridge, of Zebulon, North Carolina. ""I wish I had it recorded because the man did say this. ""He said, 'No other president has ever done something like this,' but he said, 'I'm going to do it.'"" White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters told US media hours later: ""The cheque has been sent. ""It's disgusting that the media is taking something that should be recognised as a generous and sincere gesture, made privately by the President, and using it to advance the media's biased agenda."" This video can not be played Gold Star Mother Christina Ayube: ""We don't need to be reminded of that on the way to receiving the body"" Jessie Baldridge, stepmother of the slain soldier, told local media the family feels no resentment towards Mr Trump over the delay. ""We just thought he was saying something nice,"" shetold WTVD,external, a local TV station, in North Carolina. ""We got a condolence letter from him and there was no cheque, and we kind of joked about it."" A White House official said the payment ""has been in the pipeline since the President's initial call with the father"". ""There is a substantial process that can involve multiple agencies anytime the President interacts with the public, especially when transmitting personal funds"", the official said.

"A proclamation of sexual attraction. A hand resting on the knee. A flirty text message. From the right person at the right time, they can make you feel great. But from the wrong person or at the wrong time, an innuendo-laden text becomes creepy and an unwanted touch can make you feel uncomfortable and ashamed. As the number of women making claims against Hollywood film producer Harvey Weinstein grows by the day, women around the world have spoken on social media about their experiences of sexual harassment under the #metoo Twitter hashtag. Weinstein wielded great power, able to make or break his alleged victims' careers, but harassment can be just as damaging away from work. In a global debate, the question of how we define sexual harassment is not altogether clear. And that line between flirtation and harassment is a very fine - and often blurred - one. If you want to meet someone, you have to flirt, says relationship expert James Preece. But it's about doing it in the right environment, not when people are least expecting it, he says. He advises his clients - men and women aged from 23 to 72 - to play it safe by flirting in a playful - not a sexual - way. ""Be friendly and build up a rapport and trust,"" he says. At the end of the first date, he suggests a friendly hug or peck on the cheek. When it's unwanted and persistent, says Sarah King, of Stuart Miller Solicitors. Dating expert James believes it's when a man goes too far - whether through what he says or what he does - when a woman clearly doesn't want it. Sea Ming Pak, who goes into London schools to teach young people about sex and relationships, reels off a long list of what she thinks constitutes sexual harassment: non-consensual touching; feeling entitled to someone else; talking in a certain way; chasing girls down the street in order to chat them up; wolf-whistling and using a position of power or trust to talk in a creepy way. The Oxford English Dictionary defines sexual harassment as ""unwanted sexual advances, obscene remarks, etc"". And theEquality Act 2010,externalsays it's an ""unwanted conduct of a sexual nature"" which violates a person's dignity or ""creates an intimidating, hostile, degrading or offensive environment"". This video can not be played Women are speaking out about sexual harassment through one photographer's powerful project Not specifically. It is not a criminal offence in its own right, says Sarah King. However, the types of behaviour that amount to sexual harassment can be criminalised under different pieces of legislation. For example: Unwanted phone calls and messages, visits to home or work, taking personal photographs, unwanted advances and persistent and distressing comments -Protection from Harassment Act 1997,external Sending indecent, offensive or threatening letter, emails, and messages on social media and text -Malicious Communications Act 1998,external Unwanted touching by someone who is getting sexual gratification, for example on public transport -Sexual Offences Act,external That said, anyone being sexually harassed in the workplace is protected by theEquality Act 2010.,externalA case is considered a civil - not a criminal - matter and would be dealt with in an employment tribunal. More than half of women say they have been sexually harassed at work, according to research carried out last year by the TUC. Sea Ming Pak, who works for sexual health charity Brook, blames Western society's sex-sells culture which, she says, breeds entitlement and a blame culture. Young people have been conditioned through films, music videos, TV programmes, access to porn and the normalisation of sending sexual images on phones, she says. In school assemblies and classrooms, she tells them when it comes to sex you have to have freedom and the capacity to make the choice. This video can not be played Blue Seat Studios and blogger rockstardinosaurpirateprincess created the video Consent: It's as simple as tea. But she admits she worries about how poorly informed our schoolchildren are - with many blaming the victim when a rape scenario is presented. In some cases, it is a learned behaviour, picked up from those closest to them. She describes spotting a girl from one of her classes at a bus stop with a boy draping his arm around her and being ""handsy"". ""She did not look like she wanted the attention so the next week I told her: 'You have the right to say no, it was not OK for him to touch you.' ""I explained consent, and she replied: 'But they always grab me.'"" Sea, who typically speaks to boys and girls aged between 14 and 17, thinks that until children are told they can say ""no"" at an earlier age, the problem will not go away. We should speak to them in primary schools, says Sea. That's when it starts, she says, recalling her own schooldays when boys thought it was funny to rip open girls' shirts, put their hands up their skirts, grab their bums and ping their bras. ""It was about shame and humiliation,"" she says. At that age, you talk about boundaries, she explains, and at secondary school they need to know about consent, how to read body language, negotiate situations and to think before sending sexual images of themselves. Grassroots pressure is mounting. A petition calling for the Crown Prosecution Service to make misogynistic incidents a hate crime has been signed by more than 65,000 people. In Nottinghamshire, police began recording misogynistic incidents as hate crimes; until then there was no category for such cases. The force defines those as: ""Incidents against women that are motivated by an attitude of a man towards a woman and includes behaviour targeted towards a woman by men simply because they are a woman."" It allows police to investigate the incidents as crimes and support the victims, as well as get a better picture of the scale of the problem. Sarah King says there is a gap in the legislation. She points to theCrime and Disorder Act,externalwhich includes an offence of harassment motivated by the complainant's religion or race, but not when it's sexual. A specific criminal offence for sexual harassment would define the behaviour and create clear boundaries once and for all, she says.

"Head teacher Aydin Onac has been suspended by the high-achieving grammar school The grammar school head teacher at the centre of a row about pupils not being allowed to stay on to take A-levels has been suspended. Aydin Onac, head of St Olave's in Orpington, has been suspended by the school's governors. Parents had threatened legal action after some pupils were told to leave the school before the upper sixth year. It raised questions about schools boosting their league table rankings by restricting who could take A-levels. St Olave's, in the London borough of Bromley, is one of England's top-performing grammar schools. But in August it was caught up in a high-profile dispute when some of its pupils were told they would not be re-admitted for their final year. Parents began legal proceedings that claimed that removing pupils between Year 12 and 13 - the lower and upper sixth - would have been a form of unlawful exclusion. Grammar school legal battle over A-level places dispute Is it fair to kick out pupils half way through sixth form? The parents challenged whether the school could stop pupils returning because of their expected A-level grades. St Olave's reversed its decision and allowed the pupils to return for upper sixth - and the planned court hearing did not take place. But the school's governors have now decided that the head teacher, Mr Onac, should be suspended. The governors say that the local authority is carrying out its own investigation into the A-level controversy. St Olave's was at the centre of a controversy over pupils being removed from the school before A-levels The St Olave's dispute began a wider debate about whether schools should be able to stop pupils progressing in this way - and whether filtering out academically-weaker pupils ahead of exams was being used to artificially boost results and league table rankings. Other schools were forced to review their procedures on whether to allow pupils to continue into the final year of A-levels. A statement from the chair of governors, Dr Paul Wright, said: ""I have been informed that the London Borough of Bromley will be conducting an investigation of St Olave's Grammar School in respect of concerns that have been raised over recent weeks. ""In light of this, and in order to protect the integrity of the investigation, Mr Onac has been suspended from all of his responsibilities as headmaster of the school."" ""Please remember that this suspension is without prejudice and does not presume any particular outcome.  We are committed to full transparency and will be co-operating fully with the local authority in this matter."" Bromley Council confirmed ""that there will be an investigation into concerns raised"". This year's A-level results at St Olave's saw 75% of all grades being awarded at A* or A and 96% were at A* to B grades, far above the national average.

"Jennifer Lawrence spoke out about her early career at the Elle Women in Hollywood Celebration Many were shocked when Jennifer Lawrence revealed she wasforced to stand in a ""nude line-up"" as part of a film casting. She described the experience as ""degrading and humiliating"". The actress spoke in light of recent allegations against film producer Harvey Weinstein, who has been accused of rape, sexual assault and harassment. He has ""unequivocally denied"" the claims against him and said all sexual relationships he had were consensual. Casting director Brendan McNamara said a nude casting call is ""not a normal process"" But Lawrence's revelations raise questions about whether her casting experience is commonplace in Hollywood and the wider film industry. Brendan McNamara, who worked as a casting assistant on The Bourne Supremacy, described Lawrence's ordeal as ""an awful situation"", which ""isn't representative of the industry as a whole"". He now has his own casting company and makes British independent films, and said his job is to ""make actors feel as comfortable as possible to get the best performance for our directors and producers"". ""We want to put them in a position where they can give us their best and not feel awkward,"" he told BBC News. ""I've never had to do anything that might be risque, but if I did, we would contact their agent beforehand to make the actor fully aware and make sure they are comfortable with what we are doing. When asked about standing naked in a line-up with other women at a casting and being told to lose weight by a casting director, McNamara added: ""I don't think that's a normal process at all"". ""It just seems horrible and cruel. ""It's not a casting director's job to say how someone looks or tell them to lose weight, it's our job to find someone who's right for the role."" McNamara's films include Treacle Jr which starred Tom Fisher and Game of Thrones' Aiden Gillen He added that on his low-budget indie British films he now works on, ""we try to treat everyone with the upmost respect and all these stories coming out are awful"".

"Wollaton Park said it is ""extremely dangerous"" to approach the deer Visitors to a park have been warned they are putting themselves in danger by posing for selfies with deer. The herd of 80 red deer and 120 fallow deer roam freely in Wollaton Park, Nottingham. Wildlife photographer Ted Shillitto said he saw people ""getting close to what are potentially very dangerous animals"". He said one man posed behind a stag's antlers, while a woman attempted to put her child on a stag's back. More stories from around the East Midlands A spokesman for Wollaton Park said it was mating season and ""any person or animal invading their space at any time may be attacked as the stags will defend their group"". ""They are very large and could inflict a lot of damage."" The deer at Wollaton Park roam freely throughout the grounds Mr Shillitto said the deer are ""dangerous animals and not pets"". ""It was ridiculous how close and how many were coming along. When somebody has done it, then others think that's great, we'll do it. ""One of them actually got a hold of the stag's neck as he was down on the floor and was posing between his antlers."" The photographer said one woman at the park ""picked her child up and it looked like she was going to put it on the stag's back"". Charles Smith-Jones, of the British Deer Society, said deer parks recommend people stay at least a distance of 165ft (50m) away from the animals. ""In a park, the deer are used to people and they seem tame and people are fooled into thinking they are tame,"" he added. ""But the red deer rut is going on and the males are full of adrenalin and testosterone and are competing for breeding rights.""

"Channing Tatum has stopped making his film with The Weinstein Company Channing Tatum has halted the development of a film about sexual abuse, which he had been making with Harvey Weinstein's company. Mr Weinstein ""unequivocally denies"" allegations of sexual assault, harassment and rape. The Oscar-winning producer was fired as chairman of The Weinstein Company last week, when the allegations emerged. ""The brave women who had the courage to speak their truth about [Mr] Weinstein are true heroes to us,""said Tatum.,external ""They are lifting the heavy bricks to build the equitable world we all deserve to live in. Reid Carolin produced Logan Lucky, which starred Channing Tatum ""Our lone project in development with The Weinstein Company (TWC) - Matthew Quick's brilliant book, Forgive Me Leonard Peacock - is a story about a boy whose life was torn asunder by sexual abuse. ""While we will no longer develop it or anything else that is property of TWC, we are reminded of its powerful message of healing in the wake of tragedy. ""This is a giant opportunity for real positive change that we proudly commit ourselves to.

The project would have seen Tatum starring in the film and also directing for the first time, alongside Reid Carolin.

""We were all afraid of him,"" he said. ""When he came back angry, he was unmanageable, agonising. He was suffocating."" Mr Chemloul, who worked for the producer in Cannes from 2008 to 2013, said: ""I had the feeling of driving poor innocent people, innocent girls, to the jaws of the wolf, and I could not say to them, 'Be careful where you're heading - it's dangerous'. ""When they left Weinstein's place, there was sadness; they were melancholy. ""I didn't know what had happened, but I had to console them - offer them water, or a cigarette.""

Lindsay was working with Molly Ringwald in romantic comedy Strike it Rich and said on Simon Mayo's Radio 2 show he had a row with Weinstein over a title change for the film and says this incident halted his career.

"The badger ate all the cat food in the kitchen before settling down A sleepy badger was caught napping in a cat bed in a house in Linlithgow. The badger entered the kitchen through a cat flap and filled up on cat food before going to sleep in the soft bed. The Scottish SPCA was called to the house at Beecraigs Country Park on Wednesday and an officer was able to persuade the badger to leave of its own accord. The charity said it was unusual behaviour for badgers, which are usually shy animals, to enter a home. The Scottish SPCA officer had to slide the cat bed towards the door before the badger would leave Animal rescue officer Connie O'Neil said: ""I got a surprise when I arrived at the property and saw a badger having a nap. ""He had gotten in through the cat flap and had eaten all the cat food before going for a sleep on the cat bed. ""I don't think it realised it was going into a house - it just smelled the food and wanted somewhere to have a wee nap. ""When I got there I pulled the badger's bed round so I could see him properly and he just looked at me. ""It was then that the badger noticed the back door was open so made a run for it."" 'Beach-ball sized' hedgehog rescued by Scottish SPCA Mike Flynn, chief superintendent at the Scottish SPCA, said: ""It is highly unusual for a wild badger to enter a house and we would urge anyone to immediately contact our animal helpline on 03000 999 999 should they find one in an unusual place.

"This video can not be played Theresa May: I want 'urgency' on citizens' deal EU leaders have urged Theresa May to do more to break the deadlock in the Brexit negotiations as they gather at a crunch Brussels summit. Dutch PM Mark Rutte said ""a lot more clarity"" on the UK's financial offer was needed before talks could progress. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said there were ""encouraging"" signs but that progress so far was ""not sufficient"" to open trade talks. However, Mrs Merkel suggested this could happen in December. Reality Check: How are the Brexit talks actually going? Goldman chief hints at Frankfurt move No deal? The view from the Europeans Tell EU you'll walk away, Eurosceptics tell May Mrs May, who has called for ""urgency"" in reaching agreement on the issue of citizens' rights, will address EU leaders at the summit later. At a meeting on Friday, at which the UK will not be present, the 27 leaders are expected to conclude officially that ""insufficient progress"" has been made on the first topics for discussion to move onto the second phase of trade discussions. These topics are citizens' rights, the UK's financial obligation and the border in Northern Ireland. The UK prime minister spoke of her desire for a future partnership with the EU as she arrived in Brussels, but added: ""We'll also be looking at the concrete progress that has been made in our exit negotiations and setting out ambitious plans for the weeks ahead. This video can not be played Dutch PM Mark Rutte: More details needed from UK ""I particularly, for example, want to see an urgency in reaching an agreement on citizens' rights."" Speaking to the BBC, Mr Rutte said he welcomed the PM's recent speech in Florence, where she set out what she has described as a ""bold and ambitious agenda"". But he said she needed to make ""absolutely clear"" what she was offering to do in relationship to the UK's financial obligations towards the EU. ""Maybe it's not possible now to name a number but at least to come up with a methodology, a system, a complete proposal to solve this issue,"" he said. ""As long as that is not happening I don't see how we can move forward."" Theresa May chatted to German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron at the EU summit Analysis by Europe correspondent Kevin Connolly The October summit was always the first date in the EU calendar on which a gathering of the 27 heads of government could declare themselves satisfied with the Brexit divorce negotiations and agree to start talking about trade. It's been clear for weeks that they won't do that - but they will offer the UK some encouragement by starting internal discussions about future trade with the UK - ready for any breakthrough at the next summit in December. Theresa May isn't expected to make any big new proposal in her after-dinner remarks but to underline the quality of the financial offer made in her speech in Florence - worth around Â£20bn. The EU side wants more though - more money as well as further movement on citizens rights and the Irish border. There are almost as many predictions about what happens next as there are diplomats in Brussels; one has suggested that the prospects of a December breakthrough are no better than fifty-fifty but an official close to the talks said the signal on Brexit from this summit would be fundamentally positive. Kuenssberg: Whiff of foreboding about Brexit talks Before leaving for Brussels, Mrs May used aFacebook,externalpost to offer further assurances to the three million or so nationals of other EU countries living in the UK and uncertain about their future after Brexit. In the open letter, which was also mailed to 100,000 EU nationals, she said those who already had permanent residence would be able to ""swap this"" for settled status in as hassle-free a way as possible. The process of applying for permanent residency, for which EU nationals are eligible after five years, has long been criticised as cumbersome and overly bureaucratic. At one point, it involved filling out an 85-page form. Theresa May says the future of British and EU nationals has always been her ""first priority"" In simplifying it, Mrs May said she was committed to putting ""people first"" in the negotiations and expected British nationals living on the continent to be treated in the same way. ""I know both sides will consider each other's proposals with an open mind and with flexibility and creativity on both sides, I am confident we can conclude discussions on citizens' rights in the coming weeks,"" she said. Nicolas Hatton, of the 3million pressure group formed to fight for the rights of EU nationals in the UK, described the PM's statement as ""very positive"", but said its timing was ""a bit more dubious"". ""We should have received that letter maybe 12 months ago so we would not have felt so anxious about our future"" he said, adding: ""I think the letter was actually addressed to EU leaders."" This video can not be played Vince Cable on progress of UK-EU Brexit talks This video can not be played Thornberry: Labour will not accept a no-deal Brexit Meanwhile a group of pro-Brexit Tory and Labour politicians - including former Chancellor Lord Lawson, former Conservative minister Owen Paterson and Labour MP Kate Hoey - is urging Mrs May to walk away from negotiations this week if the EU does not accommodate the UK's wishes. In the event of no progress at Thursday's meeting, the letter, organised by the Leave Means Leave campaign, says Mrs May should formally declare the UK is working on the assumption it will be reverting to World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules on 30 March 2019. Creative sector warns of Brexit threat Brexit: All you need to know 'More delays' to key Brexit bill Mr Paterson told the Today programme the UK should not be ""terrified"" of leaving the EU without a deal in place, saying this appeared ""inevitable at the moment"" due to the EU's ""complete obsession with money"" - the so-called Brexit divorce bill. But Labour's Brexit spokesman, Sir Keir Starmer, said it would be ""irresponsible"" to threaten to walk away with the talks only at ""phase one"". He added that Labour was not ""duty bound"" to support any deal the PM secures with Brussels. Sir Keir and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn are also in Brussels for their own talks with EU officials.

"Lulu's experience training as a sniffer dog was tweeted by the CIA This is Lulu, the Labrador who joined the CIA as one of their newest recruits. Her mission: to sniff out explosives.

So she had to be dropped from the puppy class of 2017.

"Lisa was one of 650 people on Utoya island when Breivik came ashore When Anders Breivik opened fire on youngsters attending a summer camp on the Norwegian island of Utoya, he carried out a massacre that to this day remains the deadliest mass shooting by a single gunman anywhere in the world. Among those taking part in the Labour Party youth camp was 17-year-old Lisa Marie Husby. She was one of 650 young people gathered on the tiny island on 22 July 2011, when Breivik appeared dressed as a police officer and began shooting. However, minutes before he arrived, Lisa had been on the phone to her mother in the wake of an explosion that had killed eight people in the centre of Oslo. Lisa had been telling her mother that she was safe and that there was no need to worry because she was miles away from the Norwegian capital. She said: ""I wanted to tell her that I was far away from Oslo and I was safe. But as I talked to her, I heard the police cars leaving our part of Norway to go and help in Oslo and I told her this and she said 'I think you guys are the next target'. ""She just had a gut feeling and I said 'there's no way, we're on an island, we're safe' and then I hung up. ""Then a couple of minutes later I heard what I thought were fireworks."" Far right extremist Breivik went on to kill 69 youngsters, 33 of whom were under the age of 18. In total, he murdered 77 people that day, including those in Oslo. Anders Behring Breivik murdered 77 people in bomb and gun attacks Speaking to Stephen Jardine on Radio Scotland'sKaye Adams programme, Lisa said in the hours before the shooting began, people had been considering going home because of the weather. She said: ""It was very rainy and usually the island is beautiful, but this day it was flooding. ""A lot of people were thinking about maybe going home, because we were sleeping in tents, and a lot of rain is not good for that. ""But everyone was in good spirits and we had the first female prime minister of Norway coming to see us and later we were going to have a disco so everyone was happy and having a good time."" Then news of the terror attack in Oslo started to filter through to those in the camp. Lisa said: ""Some people wanted to go back to Oslo because they couldn't reach their family back there. ""But we realised it wasn't possible to go back to Oslo at that point because everything was closed - no buses, no trains or anything. We said the best thing to do was stay."" It was then that Lisa spoke to her mother and tried to reassure her about their position on the island. She was with a group of a few dozen people, sheltered by a forest, who were about 50m (164ft) away when Breivik arrived on the island claiming to be there for security. Locals gathered boats near the island to try and help those jumping into the water to escape Then she began hearing what she thought was fireworks. ""Everyone was in shock at first, and I think we thought this is a horrible joke, this is too early to try and scare us. ""But then I realised seeing everyone who actually saw the gunman fleeing, that this was actually not a joke."" Lisa said her group were standing next to their tents looking confused by the sound of gunfire. She said: ""I don't think they understood what was going on. A lot of the people who actually saw what happened were fleeing, but this group were sheltered and they couldn't see what was happening, so they were just standing there not knowing what to do."" She added: ""This island is very small. You can walk across it in 10 minutes. It's a lot of cliffs and trees everywhere. At the time, I didn't even think that I could get off the island by swimming, I didn't even think that I was on an island - I just thought I have to run and hide."" Lisa gathered the group and then ran through the forest to a cabin that had previously been used as a medical base. She said: ""By the time we got to the cabin, they had actually prepared for attack. They had had a drill earlier that week in case of attack so they had already barricaded the doors and blocked the windows by the time we got into the cabin. ""We managed to get in, but then I got completely shocked and scared and thought I needed to get back out. ""They said: 'if you go we will lock the door behind you', but I still kept running. ""And then I saw this girl who was shot and I decided to go back in because I realised how serious things were then."" Terrified youngsters hid in the woods, with some jumping into the water to escape the hail of bullets. In total, 47 students, including Lisa, barricaded themselves into the cabin, hiding as best they could. ""At this point there was so many gunshots because of the automatic gun he was using, so we thought there was more than one shooter. ""We just hid under beds and tried to get into the small rooms inside the cabin and shelter ourselves from what was going on outside. We could hear the gunshots getting closer and further away and then suddenly they were very close."" Lisa and the other students heard Breivik try the door. When he could not get in he fired two shots through the window before walking off. ""We didn't know how long it would take the police to get to the island,"" Lisa said. ""We could hear boats outside, but that turned out to be civilians helping out the people who had fled or who had tried to get out by swimming. ""And we could also hear helicopters, but that turned out to be news helicopters."" The 47 students spent more than four terrifying hours inside the cabin. During that time they were receiving frantic calls from their families, who had warned them that the gunman was reportedly posing as a police officer. Breivik shot 69 people dead on the island of Utoya during his rampage The group had also decided that if Breivik entered the cabin they would lie still and pretend to be dead. Lisa said: ""The last message that I got from my family at the time was 'don't trust the police they say online that he's dressed as the police so don't trust anyone who says that they're from the police'. ""When we were just waiting, it got very quiet and the gunshots stopped. ""People started to come out from their hiding places because it got very, very quiet."" Lisa said that at this point the police suddenly stormed the cabin. She said: ""They told us to get on the floor with our hands above our head. We thought these people are here to kill us."" Lisa said she later learned that officers stormed the cabin unaware whether or not Breivik was inside with hostages. ""After the police came in we thought we were dead, we said our goodbyes. Then they asked is he here and I thought 'who's here - it's the terrorist' and then we understood they're not here to take us, they're actually looking for him."" As soon as he was confronted by officers,Anders Breivikimmediately surrendered. He was later jailed for 21 years following a trial that Lisa decided to attend. She said she was struck by how small Breivik appeared in the dock and how sad it was that such a person could cause so much harm. Lisa now studies at the University of St Andrews after being shown around the town by her partner Richard For two years following the massacre Lisa tried to continue her life in Norway. However, in 2013 her ordeal finally took its toll. She said: ""Something this traumatic is not going to leave you ever. ""So trying to go back to being a normal teenager again was very, very difficult. ""It started off with nightmares, a lot of flashbacks to the day. My nightmares sometimes got really, really bad where I woke up in the middle of the night actually believing that I was shot."" Lisa said she developed a sense of being on auto-pilot and of being an observer in her own life. She then spent a year in intensive treatment, during which she learned to talk about her experiences and their aftermath. She developed a sense of determination that ""this one day in July wouldn't define my entire life."" Months later, Lisa met her partner Richard in Norway and she began to put her life back together. She said: ""He took me to St Andrews to show me around one day and I just completely fell in love. ""I said 'maybe this is what I need. I need to get out of Norway and try and study abroad' and that's always been a dream."" In 2016 Lisa began studying at the University of St Andrews in Fife and has since become an advocate for raising awareness about issues relating to mental health.

"Marina Titova lays a carnation in memory of her great-great-uncle who died on Mudyug When British soldiers were sent to Russia after the Russian Revolution their main enemies were the Germans - their opponents in World War One - but they also found themselves fighting and imprisoning Bolsheviks. In the process they opened what Russians regard as the first concentration camp in their country. The boat sails down the River Dvina past onion-domed churches, lumber yards and logs floating in the water. Finally it reaches the open sea and an hour later a brown smudge appears on the horizon. Getting closer, I can make out a lighthouse and a few radio towers. As my companions and I jump off the boat and walk along a deserted beach a pack of dogs surrounds us, barking furiously. They are not used to visitors. The only people who live on this remote spot today are border guards and a couple of meteorologists. Back in the Soviet era, boatloads of day trippers came to the island of Mudyug to visit a museum. It was located among the remains of a prison camp - one very different from the scores of old Gulag outposts scattered across the Russian north and Siberia. For one thing, it was set up as far back as 1918.  Even more remarkably, the people in charge were were British and French. My colleague Natalia Golysheva, who grew up in the regional capital, Arkhangelsk - Archangel as it used to be known in English - says the place had a fearsome reputation. Locals called it Death Island. ""When I was little, people said if you don't behave, the Whites will come and take you to Mudyug,"" she says. ""I didn't understand but when I tried to ask questions - 'What is Mudyug? Who are the Whites?' - my grandmother just said shush and turned her face away, meaning the conversation was over."" The Whites were the anti-Bolshevik forces that emerged after the October Revolution in 1917. They got the name from the cream-coloured uniforms worn by higher ranks in the Tsarist army. Some were reactionary military officers who wanted to bring back the monarchy, others were moderate socialists, reformers, tradesmen, fishermen or peasants. When the Bolsheviks seized power in the autumn of 1917, Russia was still fighting in World War One, allied with Britain, France and the US against the Central Powers of Germany and Austria-Hungary and their Ottoman allies. However, Lenin had come to power promising supporters not only bread to eat and a share of the aristocrats' land, but also peace.  When he signed a peace treaty with Germany, Western governments acted rapidly to re-open this eastern front. British and French troops lining up in Arkhangelsk in 1919 Within months, tens of thousands of soldiers from Britain, the United States, France, Canada, Australia and other countries were ordered to Russia in what became known as the Allied Intervention. Some went to the south and far east of Russia and 14,000 troops under British command were sent to Arkhangelsk, near the Arctic Circle. The men were told their mission was to protect military stores and stop Germany from establishing a submarine base. But the foreign troops also took the side of the Whites in Russia's nascent Civil War. Some European politicians, such as Winston Churchill, worried about Communism spreading across Europe. Soon after the Allies docked in Arkhangelsk on 2 August 1918, they began locking people up. ""They didn't know who to trust or the difference between the Reds and Whites - so they decided to incarcerate anyone who seemed suspect,"" says Liudmila Novikova, a Moscow-based historian who has become an expert on the post-revolutionary period in the Russian north. Since the main prison in the town was overcrowded, potential troublemakers were shipped to the island of Mudyug, 70km (45 miles) away. The first batch of inmates had to build their own prison camp in this desolate, windswept place. Bolshevik prisoners in the prison camp on Mudyug island We walk along the beach past a rickety watchtower before taking a path through a pine forest.   It leads to some wooden barracks with rusty barbed wire on the windows. The door opens with a creak and we are inside a long dormitory with hundreds of beds, divided by panels of wood. Each seems as narrow as a coffin. Marina Titova, a young museum guide from Arkhangelsk who has joined us on the trip, sits on one of the beds, lost in thought. Her great-great-uncle Fyodor Oparin, a roofer, had been at the front fighting the Germans in World War One. He was only briefly reunited with his wife and small daughter before he was arrested and sent to Mudyug, accused of recruiting the men in his village into the Red Army. With few washing facilities and no change of clothes, inmates soon became infested with lice. Typhus spread like wildfire. Overall, about 1,000 people were imprisoned here and up to 300 died - either as a result of disease, or because they were shot or tortured to death. When we visit it is a muggy summer afternoon and the air is thick with midges. I dread to think what it would be like here during an Arctic winter when temperatures can reach -30C (-22F). Signs from the now abandoned museum point out the ""ice cells"", left open to the elements, where rebellious prisoners were punished and either perished or lost limbs to frostbite. Pavel Rasskazov, a radical journalist, spent several months on Mudyug. In his Prison Memoirs, which became a well-known and much-studied text in the Soviet era, he documented the appalling conditions and the lack of food. He describes how, when dried bread was distributed in the morning, ""starving, angry men with greedy eyes crawled all over the filthy, damp floor, full of spit, picking up each and every crumb"". Rasskazov managed to survive this place, unlike Marina's relative, Fyodor Oparin. According to one account, he tried to escape but was too weak to move fast and was shot as he ran. In another version of events, he was caught and executed the following day, along with 13 other prisoners. Fyodor Oparin with his wife, Marina Under some fir trees Marina has found a commemorative plaque to the men killed trying to escape. As she places two red carnations on the crumbling stone, a cloud of mist swirls through the trees and a soft rain falls. ""Perhaps it was just a coincidence,"" she says later. ""But it seemed like a greeting from the past, and maybe those prisoners who suffered here, who tried to survive, could see that they were being remembered."" In Soviet times these men were remembered more often. On a small hill by the camp, there is a 25m-high obelisk adorned with a red star and hammer and sickle. Some chunks of granite have fallen off but you can still read the inscription which says it was built ""in honour of patriots tortured to death by the Interventionists"". ""This monument could be seen by all the ships sailing past,"" says historian Liudmila Novikova. ""Foreign sailors who came to Arkhangelsk were often taken to Mudyug to remind them of all the atrocities their fellow countrymen and governments committed here."" Schoolchildren and factory workers also came on visits. Near the monument, we find a run-down hall with dusty glass cases, peeling red posters on the walls and photographs of the ""martyrs who gave their lives for the Revolution"" or died here on the island, which is described in the inscriptions as a concentration camp. There are pictures of Gen Edmund Ironside, the British commander of all the Allied troops in the region. Novikova says he would have known what was happening on the island even if he never visited. This is confirmed by an entry in the leather-bound notebooks he kept in Russia, now in the possession of his 93-year-old son. ""Scurvy seems to be beginning among the Russian prisoners on Mudyug Islandâ¦ and as it is a difficult place to get to, rations have been pinched,"" the general writes. If the British established the camp and some of those in charge were French, many guards seem to have been local men. ""We cannot have a scandalous camp,"" he writes. ""I am responsible that the Russians treat their people well. I am always after them over the state of the prison."" But Novikova says improving conditions on Mudyug was hardly a priority for Ironside. ""For him it was just a necessary security measure, and after all people were fighting and dying every day on all the fronts. So if prisoners in the rear were dying from bad conditions, that was just a drop in the ocean of suffering here."" The treatment of prisoners on Mudyug horrified one man who would later play a devastating role in northern Russia. A prominent Bolshevik close to Lenin, Mikhail Kedrov, was sent to Arkhangelsk after the October revolution and later became became a fanatical regional head of the Cheka - the secret police. Alexander Orlov, a fellow Chekist who later defected to Canada, recalls Kedrov as a tall handsome man with ragged black hair.  He writes that his eyes were often ""gleaming like burning coalâ¦ possibly these were the sparks of madness"". Soviet citizens were encouraged to visit the Mudyug prison camp While the Red Terror was not mentioned in the USSR for decades, the crimes of the White forces were endlessly listed in official propaganda. Atrocities were committed on both sides, says historian Liudmila Novikova, but the scale was different. ""The Whites and Allies who supported them were mainly pragmatic. They wanted to kill those who undermined their effort, troops who rebelled or members of the Bolshevik underground - they didn't care about eliminating their enemies totally. It was quite different on Red side because they were waging a war against the old regime - the bourgeoisie, Tsarist officers and  whole classes were perceived as enemies who had to be liquidated,"" she says. Lucy Ash tells the story of the forgotten war fought by Western troops in Arctic Russia inThe Red and the White, on the BBC World Service Click here for transmission times, or to listen online Mikhail Kedrov set up a number of death camps in the North, including the first one of its kind, in Kholmogory, an hour's drive from Arkhangelsk. Somewhere between 3,000 and 8,000 people were imprisoned and killed at a 17th Century convent. Many were White Army officers and sailors from the Kronstadt naval fortress near Finland who had rebelled against the Bolsheviks. But others had nothing to do with the military. Some were clergy, some were ordinary people who for some reason had been labelled ""counter-revolutionaries"". At Kholmogory, where much of the convent is now held up by scaffolding and wrapped in corrugated iron, I met Elena, a parishioner who sings in the convent choir. She says people in the area sometimes find skulls when they dig pits to store potatoes over the winter. Elena says the priest and volunteers collected some human remains in sacks and buried them under a marble cross on one side of the Cathedral of the Transfiguration. Each year they sing a requiem for those who died. It's hard to pinpoint but there is an oppressive atmosphere which clings to this place, like the cold to the refectory walls when Elena invites us inside for a cup of tea. Locals use the path through the garden as a shortcut across the town but Elena says few know - or care - about Kholmogory's terrible history. Does she believe the Allied Intervention was the catalyst for Russia's devastating civil war, as Lenin and others have often claimed? ""I remember in my childhood hearing stories from my granny,"" she says. ""I was a Young Pioneer and I told her the Reds were good and the Whites were bad and the Intervention troops were bad. And my granny said 'What are you talking about? The English came to our village, they brought us white flour, they gave the children sweets.' And I said: 'Granny - that is impossible they are our enemies!'"" Elena shakes her head.  ""They were not our enemies and to say they were responsible for the civil war is wrong. Of course not! We had enough of our own scoundrels without the intervention troops."" The radical journalist, Pavel Rasskazov, who documented his ordeal on Mudyug island, describes a French-Russian officer and former businessman from Moscow, a man ""of medium height, stout, with a round, flabby face, like a bulldog"". Ernest Beaux was actually a perfumer who concocted scents for the tsar's family - such as the ""Bouquet de Napoleon"". But in 1918 he was working as a counter-intelligence officer on Mudyug, interrogating Bolsheviks captured by the White Russian and Allied armies. By the end of the year, Beaux had emigrated to France, where a cousin of Nicholas II introduced him to the couturier, Coco Chanel. He has gone down in history as the man who invented Chanel No5. According to some accounts he wanted to capture the essence of snow melting on black earth and asinspired by his time in the ""land of the midnight sun,external"" - the Russian Arctic.

"So it's come down to money. Who would have thought it? After five rounds of negotiations on Brexit, the EU remains insistent: there will be no discussions with the UK on a transition period, or on future relations, until financial commitments have been clarified. So what exactly is it about the money that is proving so difficult to resolve? It comes down to the detail (or lack of it) contained in Theresa May's carefully crafted speech in Florence. Brexit: What did we learn from Theresa May's Florence speech Overall, the speech was greeted across the EU with a considerable sense of relief. It suggested that progress was at least possible at a time when some countries were beginning to fear the worst. The prime minister opened the door for the UK to contribute roughly â¬20bn (Â£17.9bn) to the EU budget in 2019 and 2020, so that no-one else would be out of pocket. And - crucially - she went on to say that ""the UK will honour commitments we have made during the period of our membership"". But EU negotiators - under clear instructions from the member states - want to know exactly what that means in practice. The prime minister said the UK would ""honour commitments"" Looming large in the background is something called the Reste Ã  Liquider (RAL) - EU money that has already been committed to projects in the long-term budget but has not yet been spent. The RAL is currently running at an eye-watering â¬239bn, which could mean a UK share of more than â¬30bn. Much of it is due to be spent on big infrastructure or development projects that have been delayed. There are also pensions and contingent liabilities, such as loans to other countries, to consider. The EU isn't asking for a figure to be agreed - but for a guarantee within the negotiating process, probably in writing, that ""honouring commitments"" means ""all commitments."" The UK position, on the other hand, is that the prime minister made a substantial gesture in her Florence speech, and it is in no position to move further unless it gets something in return. ""They are using time pressure to get more money out of us,"" the Brexit Secretary David Davis told the House of Commons this week. ""Bluntly, that is what's going on."" It sounds like deadlock, but that's not necessarily the case. Three more rounds of negotiation have been suggested between this week's summit and another one in December. The hope is that a way will be found to move forward, even if it takes a moment of crisis to get there. ""The EU27 don't believe the UK is too far off 'sufficient progress',"" says Mujtaba Rahman, the managing director for Europe at the political consultancy Eurasia Group. ""They want Mrs May to be able to leave Brussels with a win that will enable her to strike a deal by December."" That's why both sides have said they want to accelerate the negotiating process, and prepare for discussions about the future. Reality Check: Does the UK owe the EU money? Reality Check: What would 'no deal' look like? If the language of the current draft of the summit's conclusions doesn't change much, the EU27 will agree to begin internal discussions about a transition period and the nature of a future relationship. They won't talk directly to the UK about these issues until December at the earliest. And only then if ""sufficient progress"" has been made on all the ""divorce"" arrangements, including money. It doesn't sound like much. But it's a start, and it is seen in Brussels as a carrot for the UK negotiating team. So what might the EU be likely to decide in internal discussions over the coming weeks? For EU officials involved in the negotiating process one thing about transition is clear: the more you keep things the same, the easier it will be to agree. That's why the internal deliberations among the 27 on transition could be concluded very quickly. They will probably offer to prolong all existing EU rules and regulations (the body of law known as 'the acquis') - or, to put it another way - to extend the status quo. That means that after Brexit - for ""about two years"" (ie for the length of a transition period) - the UK would be outside the EU's political institutions, but inside its economic arrangements. It also means the UK would have to accept EU budget payments, EU regulations and the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. To put it in the formal language of the European Council's Article 50negotiating guidelines,external: ""Should a time-limited prolongation of Union acquis be considered, this would require existing Union regulatory, budgetary, supervisory, judiciary and enforcement instruments and structures to apply."" The details of what that means are difficult for some Brexit supporters in the UK to stomach. But the prime minister, in her Florence speech, has already accepted that the framework for any transition (she prefers to call it an implementation period) would be ""the existing structure of EU rules and regulations"". Problems would arise, however, if the UK tried to argue for exemptions or exceptions. Take, for example, one idea that has been floated (forgive the pun): leaving the Common Fisheries Policy at the same time as the UK leaves the EU in March 2019. That doesn't really tally with the kind of transition that EU officials have in mind. Once you start unpicking the offer, all sorts of complications begin to arise. So it's not quite take it or leave it. But it's not far off. Unpicking the agreement, such as leaving the Common Fisheries Policy, could lead to further complications There are other potential problems with a transition period that will need to be resolved. What, for example, does it mean for trade agreements with third countries, when it makes a difference whether products (or parts of products) are manufactured in the single market or not? But agreeing upon the terms of a transition will be much easier for the EU27 than agreeing on the outline of a final deal - on everything from trade to security. The 27 member states are a little more nervous about those discussions because differences of opinion are bound to emerge between them. Many countries have obviously been thinking hard about this already. One internal German government paper has been reportedhere,external. But there is another issue that overshadows debate about Brexit in capitals across the EU - what exactly is it that the UK wants? Every change of emphasis in London adds to the confusion. As Finland's Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Samuli Virtanen, put it this week: ""It seems that at the moment the EU 27 is more unanimous than the UK 1. And that is one of the main problems here."" But it all rests on finding a compromise on money. And that really has to happen before the end of this year.  Otherwise time is going to start running out.

"India is in the throes of an economic slowdown and a jobs crisis under Mr Modi's leadership One of the reasons why Narendra Modi swept to victory with a historic mandate in 2014 was his combative and upbeat oratory. Three years on, the Indian prime minister is beginning to sound unusually defensive. Many say Mr Modi's characteristic bluster and bombast have begun to wane. In recent speeches, he has described his critics as doomsayers, blamed the previous Congress government for India's economic ills, painted himself as an ""outsider"" and said he was ""willing to drink poison"" for the good of the country. Has the victor turned victim? ""A small number of people weaken us,"" Mr Modi told a gathering of company secretaries recently. ""We need to recognise such people."" So is Mr Modi beginning to lose his mojo? Three years ago, when he won his landslide, he promised reforms and jobs. But under his leadership - and at a time when the world economy appears to be taking off - India is looking like a sorry outlier, battling an economic slowdown and a jobs crisis. India jobs: The signs point to a bleak outlook for employment Has Narendra Modi lived up to expectations? Is Narendra Modi's government unravelling? The making of Narendra Modi Banks are struggling with mountains of bad loans, which in turn has choked credit and hurt domestic investment. ""India's economy is grounded,external,"" says economist Praveen Chakravarty. Mr Modi's response has been criticised as piecemeal and clumsy. Acontroversial currency banlast November, politically sold as a crackdown on the illegal economy, ended up halting growth and causing a lot of misery. The Goods and Services Tax was criticised for the way it was introduced July's introduction of amuch-lauded countrywide Goods and Services Tax(GST) to help India move towards a common market has caused widespread business disruption because of what is seen as shoddy execution. In cities and towns, traders are upset over the grinding tax bureaucracy engendered by the GST. In villages - nearly half of Indians are engaged in agriculture - farmers are complaining of income insecurity as they believe the government isn't paying them enough for their produce. Also, for the first time since winning power, Mr Modi's government is under attack. A senior functionary from Mr Modi's party, the BJP, recentlyblamed his government,externalfor the economic slowdown. ""The prime minister claims that he has seen poverty from close quarters,"" former finance minister Yashwant Sinha wrote. ""His finance minister is working overtime to make sure that all Indians also see it from equally close quarters."" And Mr Modi is taking flak from the opposition too for a change. His main political rival, Rahul Gandhi, of the once mighty Congress party, appears to be suddenly re-energised andhas been taking on Mr Modi,externalmore aggressively than ever before. Added to this, theson of Amit Shah, Mr Modi's closest aide, is accused of corruption. Jay Shah denies the allegations and has threatened to sue non-profit news website The Wire over the story. Thus far since taking office, Mr Modi has been greatly helped by four unrelated things. Low oil prices - India imports most of its crude - helped boost growth and tame inflation. Second, a chunk of the domestic mainstream media which depends on government advertising has been largely uncritical of his government. Third, Mr Modi faces no leadership challenge from within his party, which he and Amit Shah dominate. Lastly, and most importantly, a political opposition largely in disarray has failed to offer aspirational Indians an alternative - and persuasive - narrative of hope. Mr Modi and Amit Shah (left) dominate the BJP Still, there's""something in the air"",external, as Shekhar Gupta, editor of The Print news site, says. One indication is that even Mr Modi's fiercely pugnacious supporters are markedly subdued on social media these days. On the other hand, social media is awash with memes making fun of the prime minister. Mr Modi's politics are also causing discontent. By whipping up what many say is hysteria over the sale and consumption of beef and pandering to Hindu radicals, observers say his party has begun to frighten off many young people and urban folk. To make matters worse, his party appointed acontroversial Hindu religious leaderknown for anti-Muslim rhetoric to run the political bellwether state of Uttar Pradesh, where the BJPwon a decisive mandatein March. About a fifth of Uttar Pradesh's 200 million people are Muslim. In 2014, Mr Modi secured the overwhelming majority of the young votes. But is support from this quarter waning? BJP-supported student unions have lost elections in three major universities in Delhi and Hyderabad. Last month's unrest in a leading university in Mr Modi's constituency in Varanasi, in Uttar Pradesh, wherepolice beat female university studentsprotesting against an alleged sexual assault, will not endear him and his party to young voters. On the economy, Mr Modi clearly seems to have overplayed his hand and questions are being asked over whether he can fulfil expectations. In June, the Economist said Mr Modi was""not the radical reformer he is cracked up to be"",external. The magazine said he had few big ideas of his own - the GST, for example, had been initiated during the previous, Congress, regime. Critics say despite running India's most powerful government in recent history, he has achieved little in creating functioning markets for land and electricity, and reforming labour laws. On his politics, they say, Mr Modi appears to be hostage to the party's ideological fountainhead, the right-wing Hindu nationalistRashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh(National Volunteers' Organisation), known for what many say are visions of Hindu glory and achievement. The BJP remains India's most dominant party Economists such as Dr Chakravarty believe Mr Modi still has time to revive the economy by exploiting the buoyant stock market, which isflush with money from foreign institutional investors,external. Money could be raised by divesting stakes in state-run companies and used to recapitalise and clean up the ailing banks, so that they can begin lending again. Also the rupee could be depreciated to boost exports, the GST simplified further to help small businesses and interest rates lowered to spur growth. Growth will also depend on social stability, but it is not clear whether Mr Modi will be able to rein in the radical hotheads. However, Mr Modi is a redoubtable fighter. It is too early to say the tide is turning against him decisively. Oneopinion poll,externalin August indicated he would win handsomely if elections were held. But then again, a month can be a long time in politics. State elections in BJP-ruled Gujarat in December will offer some clues - a recent survey by the Centre for the Study of Developing Societies (CSDS) suggested people were ""unhappy with GST"". Nobody expects the BJP to lose, but the margin of victory will be closely watched. India's once robust economy is slowing Among his supporters, Mr Modi enjoys a reputation of being a hardworking and honest prime minister. ""What has helped in stopping this wind of dissatisfaction from turning into a strong hurricane are two factors - the absence of a viable alternative, and the personal credibility of Mr Modi,"" says political scientist Sanjay Kumar. ""The only question that remains is: how long will Mr Modi be able to hold down this wave of resentment with his own image and credibility?"" And right now that answer is blowing in the wind.

"The pressures of school life can be tough for a lot of kids, but for a child who's experienced abuse, neglect and years in care, the strain can be even greater. When Evelyn and Tony adopted Ryan at the age of seven, his special educational needs were not immediately apparent. Ryan is smart, bright and eager to please - every teacher's dream. But the trauma of his early years meant the day-to-day expectations of mainstream school were too much for him. Evelyn:Ryan came to us with a history of abuse and neglect - domestic violence, drugs and alcohol, not getting enough food, inadequate clothing, extremely poor hygiene - but nothing actually diagnosed as being any particular special need. He used to hide a lot when we first had him, so if you even very slightly raised your voice, or there was even a slight sign of disapproval - the slightest - he would hide behind a curtain or under the bed and shake and ask you if you were going to hit him. He'd been in multiple schools before he came to us and when he came to us we were advised that he only went in for a couple of hours per day for the first few weeks. I think he did very well with that. He integrated in the beginning very well because the pressure isn't so much in Year 2 and in Year 3. He coped quite well then. Tony:It was more Year 5 and 6. That's when it really started to hit. He found it more of a struggle, the work was harder and he couldn't cope with it. When he was in Year 6 we stopped all homework because when we tried to do homework with him he couldn't cope with it. He threatened to self-harm and to harm us, as well. Evelyn:Especially then with Sats tests in Year 6. The anxiety got worse and worse. His sleep became much worse, he became much more anxious. He started not being able to go in in the morning, feeling really sick. There were days when we couldn't get him in to school. It was dreadfully stressful. Tony:Plus he wouldn't sleep very well, so we were trying to help him to sleep. We were often up 'til one or two in the morning. Both ends of the day were a problem. Evelyn:We repeatedly asked the primary school to have an educational psychologist come in and make an assessment and we were constantly told: ""No, there's not enough need. He's intelligent"". So we got absolutely nowhere. The subsequent move to a comprehensive school proved highly stressful for Ryan and, after a term and a half, he dropped out. Evelyn:The Senco (special educational needs co-ordinator) seemed not to have much experience around trauma and attachment issues. When he met Ryan on the first day, we felt as if he was suggesting that we were lying, because he didn't outwardly appear to be anxious and he was very good at trying to fit in and looked good, looked smart and didn't look like a child with special needs. Unfortunately because they didn't adequately understand him - because it is mainstream education - they couldn't provide for his needs. Tony:Things slowly got worse and worse and he started school-refusing. We tried all sorts of things to help him and talked to the teachers. 'Quarter of adoptive families' in crisis 'We're scared of our adopted son' That worked for a little bit, but eventually he just couldn't cope. He couldn't cope with the large classrooms, he couldn't cope with certain teachers, any teacher that shouted, and eventually he just hid in a cupboard for a couple of days and wouldn't come out. We just couldn't get him to school. Evelyn:And when he wasn't in school anymore, he became quite agoraphobic, he became very isolated and his mental health was even worse because he wasn't in any form of education. Desperate for help, Evelyn and Tony turned to the adoption agency Family Futures and to a specialist children's hospital. These organisations assessed Ryan and reported that he did have specific needs. Evelyn:The Family Futures report came out telling us that Ryan had developmental trauma, sensory modulation difficulty, generalised anxiety disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder. We also went to the attachment and trauma team at the children's hospital and they did assessments, as well. So between the two places, that was the diagnosis and this gave us all the evidence we needed for getting our EHCP [education, health and care plan], which we triggered ourselves. Tony:Luckily we got that EHCP and that helped us secure Ryan's education - to go to a special needs school. Evelyn:But none of the schools in our local authority [area] met his needs. We were then advised that we'd have to look beyond our own borough to try and find something. So we searched the internet and we found a local therapeutic provision for education. He was offered a place and started this September. His new school is much smaller, with much smaller classes. It's individually tailored to each child's needs and there's much more encouragement. It's about building him up, meeting his needs - it's not about getting him nine GCSEs; it's about trying to help him survive. For two weeks he went part-time. He's full-time now and he loves it. In fact, tonight he said to me: ""Thank you for fighting for me. If I ever win the Oscars, I'll get you on stage to celebrate with me."" In spite of their battles, Evelyn and Tony have no regrets, but wish the authorities were more honest with, and supportive of, adoptive families. Evelyn:We've had a lot of people in education look at Ryan and say: ""But there's nothing wrong with him, he looks completely normal."" And I think that, as adopters, when we adopted him, we thought exactly the same. I don't think that we had any idea that he had this level of special need and when you finally get these diagnoses, in some ways it's quite shocking. It's quite a relief but it's also a shock because you do feel they did know or they could have really guessed that there would be some degree of need in this way - but they don't tell you and it would really help if you did know. Tony:It would be much better if the authorities were able to give a lot more help, because without so much of a battle it would be great. Sometimes it is just really hard work and it seems like you're constantly having a wall to climb each time to get help, which there really shouldn't be. We don't have any regrets at all. To anyone who's thinking about adopting I'd say you've got to go in with your eyes open, getting as much information as you can and realising that lots of the children that get adopted will have special needs in some way, or need extra help in their life, and that's a battle sometimes - but it's worth it. All names have been changed.

"This video can not be played Rachel wants to be an organ donor Organs from 505 registered donors could not be made available for transplant in the last five years because of objections from relatives. BBC 5 live found that almost a third of families blocked organ donation because they felt the process took ""too long"". The law states that consent lies with the deceased, but in practice, relatives' wishes are always respected. The NHS wants to reduce the number of ""overrides"" by encouraging prospective donors to talk to their relatives. In England, NHS figures showed that 457 people died last year whilst waiting for an organ transplant. England to consider opt-out organ donation Does presumed consent boost donation rates? Rachel, 17, from Stoke-on-Trent, wants to be an organ donor, but is concerned that her family do not support her wishes. She told 5 live: ""I wasn't aware when I signed up that your family had to be supportive of your decision. It seems like, well, what's the point of signing up if it could be overruled anyway? ""It does worry me because, if I died now, my mum does make the main decision. I hope I can trust her to make the right one."" When somebody dies who is on the Organ Donation Register, specialist nurses from NHS Blood and Transplant work with their family. If relatives object, nurses will encourage them to accept their loved one's decision, and make it clear that they do not have the legal right to override it. However, in practice, if a family still refuses, the donation does not go ahead. Ben Cole, a specialist nurse for organ donation working in the Midlands, said it was ""frustrating"" when families say no. ""We understand that families are approached about donation at a very difficult time, and it can come as a shock to find out their relative had made the decision to donate. ""I had one family whose son had joined the Organ Donor Register, but they found it hard to believe because he'd never spoken about it. ""Another family said their dad would have ticked any box, and so weren't convinced he'd signed up intentionally. ""The relationship we build with a family at this time is so important, particularly as they can provide vital information about their relative before donation. ""If they are strongly opposed to donation, we would not want to upset them further."" Other reasons relatives gave for refusing consent include that they thought ""the patient had suffered enough"", they ""didn't want surgery to the body"", or the family were divided over the decision. Anthony Clarkson, assistant director of organ donation and transplantation for NHS Blood and Transplant, said: ""Although the number of blocked transplants is declining, a number of families each year feel unable to support their relative's decision to be a donor. ""As a result hundreds of opportunities for potentially life saving transplants are being missed every year."" There are currently 6,406 people on the transplant waiting list across the UK. Jess Harris, 29, from London, needs a pancreas and a kidney. She thinks it's a ""crazy system"" that gives families the final say. ""Why isn't it like your will? Why don't they have to honour your wishes?"" she told 5 live. ""I don't know why anyone would be against donating organs - one person can save up to eight lives and you're not going to need them when you're dead."" But Dr Rebecca Brown, a research fellow in practical ethics at the University of Oxford, supports families having the final say. She says: ""There's an implication that these families are selfish or unreasonable, but I don't think that's the case. ""Losing a loved one, in sudden circumstances, is very traumatic and forcing them to go along with organ donation when it is something to which they feel strongly opposed, would be very distressing. ""This is a relatively small number of families and going against their wishes would be frankly awful for them and would create all sorts of problems."" In 2016/17 the total number of deceased donors was 1,413. In the same year, families blocked the donations of 91 people who had signed the register. In December 2015, Wales adopted an opt-out system of organ donation, but families can still have the final say over their loved one's donation. Last year, nine people in Wales who had signed up to the organ donation register were blocked from donating their organs. Prime Minister Theresa May has pledged to introduce presumed consent for organ donation in England and a consultation will be held before the end of the year.

"Violence in Shakespeare's Titus Andronicus might be ""upsetting"", students have been warned Shakespeare contains gore and violence that might ""upset"" you, Cambridge University students have been warned. The ""trigger warnings"" - red triangles with an exclamation mark - appeared on their English lecture timetables. Lectures including Shakespeare's Titus Andronicus contain ""discussion of sexual violence, sexual assault"", the BBC's Newsnight programme has learned. The university said the warnings were ""at the lecturer's own discretion"" and ""not a faculty-wide policy"". The lecture timetables were issued to this term's students by the university's faculty of English. More news from Cambridgeshire ""Any session containing material that could be deemed upsetting (and it is not obvious from the title) is now marked with a symbol,"" they say. Among those considered ""upsetting"" is a lecture on ""violence"" - which includes a discussion of Shakespeare's Titus Andronicus and Sarah Kane's play Blasted. Alongside the warning symbol, students are told to expect discussion of sexual violence and sexual assault. Shakespeare's play includes mutilation, murder and violent rape with similar topics, plus torture and genocide covered in Kane's play. Parts of this term's English lecture timetable for Cambridge students include ""upsetting"" themes Also singled out for a warning is a lecture on ""inhabiting the body"" which includes a discussion on dismemberment. Included in this is the Greek playwright Euripides' The Bacchae, which features scenes of women tearing cattle and humans to pieces. Cambridge University said it was at the lecturer's own discretion to flag up upsetting material Asked about the warnings, one Cambridge academic who did not wish to be named, said their ""duty as educators was to prepare students for the world not protect them for three years"". Prof Dennis Hayes from Derby University's education faculty said: ""Once you get a few trigger warnings, lecturers will stop presenting anything that is controversial... gradually, there is no critical discussion"". Cambridge University said the English faculty ""does not have a policy on trigger warnings"", but added: ""Some lecturers indicate that some sensitive material will be covered in a lecture... this is entirely at the lecturer's own discretion and is in no way indicative of a faculty-wide policy.""

"Labour's Jacinda Ardern is the next prime minister New Zealand is set for a centre-left coalition government led by Labour head Jacinda Ardern. Ms Ardern has been opposition leader for the last three months. At 37, she is set to be the country's youngest prime minister since 1856. Her Labour Party came second in September's election, where no party was able tosecure a majority. They are now tipped for power after the small New Zealand First party agreed to join them in government. The new coalition will also be supported by the Green Party. Analysis by Hywel Griffith, BBC News Jacinda Ardern has already proved she can run a good campaign and broker a political deal - but now she faces new challenges. High on her to-do list will be convincing the majority of New Zealanders who didn't vote for her that the party which came second should be in power. There are also bridges to build with the Australian government - which accused the New Zealand Labour party of conspiring against it in the current dual-nationals crisis. But the biggest challenge could be keeping her new coalition on the tracks. Her likely Deputy Prime Minister Winston Peters is known to hold a real dislike for the Green Party, on which the government will depend to get its policies through. Arguably, now is when the real hard work beings. Who is Jacinda Ardern? Baby question angers NZ party leader What propels young leaders to power? New Zealand First head Winston Peters on Thursday announced his party's decision to ally itself with Labour, after 26 days of negotiations. His party holds the balance of power with nine seats, while the Labour-Green bloc has 54 seats and the National Party 56 seats. He said his party was faced with a decision between ""modified status quo or change"" and decided to go for change. This video can not be played Jacinda Ardern becomes New Zealand's youngest female leader The campaign ahead of the September general election had seen a tightly contested race between incumbent Bill English, from the National Party, and rising political star Jacinda Ardern. Ms Ardern's popularity brought her party back into contention The strong Labour support, dubbed ""Jacinda-mania"", brought the party neck and neck with the National Party, though supported dropped slightly in the last days of the campaign. Ms Ardern had targeted young New Zealanders with policies on education subsidies, housing and the environment. Who is Jacinda Ardern? Involved in left-wing politics since her teens - including spending time in the UK as policy adviser to Tony Blair First entered parliament in 2008, at the age of 28 Took over the Labour leadership on 31 July Made tackling inequality, affordable housing and student debt a key part of her election campaign Has been outspoken on feminism and mental health Brought up a Mormon - but left the faith over its opposition to same-sex marriage Speaking to reporters after the coalition deal was announced, Ms Ardern said: ""I feel extraordinarily honoured and privileged to be in the position to form a government with Labour at the lead."" She said the government would work hard to deliver on its campaign promises, and that New Zealand First would have four cabinet positions and one parliamentary under-secretary. Correspondents say the new coalition is likely to mean a significant cut to immigration quotas and new controls on foreign ownership of property. Bill English became prime minister in 2016 when his predecessor John Key unexpectedly resigned. He had promised voters experience and reliable economic management.

"Danny Jordaan is a prominent member of the governing ANC party South African singer and ex-MP Jennifer Ferguson has accused the country's football boss Danny Jordaan, 66, of raping her nearly 24 years ago. He ""overpowered"" her and ""painfully"" raped her in a hotel in Port Elizabeth city, she has alleged in a blog. Mr Jordaan, who organised the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, has not yet responded to a request for comment. Now living in Sweden, Ms Ferguson said she had been moved by the#MeToo,externalcampaign on social media to speak out. Africa Live: More updates How 'MeToo' is exposing the scale of sexual abuse She said the attack took place when she was ""high and happy"" following her unexpected nomination by Nelson Mandela's African National Congress (ANC) party to serve in South Africa's first democratically elected parliament in 1994. Mr Jordaan, a prominent member of the ANC and president of the South African Football Association, came to her hotel suite after she had given a performance at a dinner. ""He overpowered me and painfully raped me. It must have been over in about 20 seconds although it felt like a lifetime,""she alleged,external. ""He left immediately without saying a word."" Jennifer Ferguson says she wants rape survivors to ""begin to heal"" Ms Ferguson said she had been ""bewildered"" and in a state of ""complete shock"". ""Not sure what to do, I washed and left the hotel and began to walk. I reached the beach and sat there a very long time trying to process what had happened,"" she said. ""The thought of going to the police felt intolerable. What would I say? Should I have screamed louder? Fought him off harder? Had I been complicit in some way? All these questions raged in my mind. I wept."" She accused the football boss of using her as ""an object for his sad need for power and twisted gratification"". ""I am not speaking out to get revenge on Danny Jordaan or a million South African men like him. I am doing this so we can help each other be courageous, speak out and begin to heal as we find we are not alone,"" she added. 'My #MeToo experience is sadly typical' Why are some women boycotting Twitter? Ms Ferguson campaigned against military conscription during white-minority rule in South Africa. State radio banned her songs, including Letters For Dickie, sung in the form of letters from a girl to her boyfriend who was a conscripted soldier on the border. Mr Jordaan was widely praised for spearheading South Africa's 2010 football World Cup bid. It was the first time that the tournament was played in Africa. In 2015, the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) alleged that South Africa had paid a $10m (Â£6.5m) bribe to host the tournament. Mr Jordaan and the government strongly denied the allegation. Mr Jordaan was mayor of Nelson Mandela Bay, which includes Port Elizabeth, until 2016, when the opposition took control of it in elections.

"This video can not be played Theresa May: I want 'urgency' on citizens' deal EU leaders have urged Theresa May to do more to break the deadlock in the Brexit negotiations as they gather at a crunch Brussels summit. Dutch PM Mark Rutte said ""a lot more clarity"" on the UK's financial offer was needed before talks could progress. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said there were ""encouraging"" signs but that progress so far was ""not sufficient"" to open trade talks. However, Mrs Merkel suggested this could happen in December. Reality Check: How are the Brexit talks actually going? Goldman chief hints at Frankfurt move No deal? The view from the Europeans Tell EU you'll walk away, Eurosceptics tell May Mrs May, who has called for ""urgency"" in reaching agreement on the issue of citizens' rights, will address EU leaders at the summit later. At a meeting on Friday, at which the UK will not be present, the 27 leaders are expected to conclude officially that ""insufficient progress"" has been made on the first topics for discussion to move onto the second phase of trade discussions. These topics are citizens' rights, the UK's financial obligation and the border in Northern Ireland. The UK prime minister spoke of her desire for a future partnership with the EU as she arrived in Brussels, but added: ""We'll also be looking at the concrete progress that has been made in our exit negotiations and setting out ambitious plans for the weeks ahead. This video can not be played Dutch PM Mark Rutte: More details needed from UK ""I particularly, for example, want to see an urgency in reaching an agreement on citizens' rights."" Speaking to the BBC, Mr Rutte said he welcomed the PM's recent speech in Florence, where she set out what she has described as a ""bold and ambitious agenda"". But he said she needed to make ""absolutely clear"" what she was offering to do in relationship to the UK's financial obligations towards the EU. ""Maybe it's not possible now to name a number but at least to come up with a methodology, a system, a complete proposal to solve this issue,"" he said. ""As long as that is not happening I don't see how we can move forward."" Theresa May chatted to German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron at the EU summit Analysis by Europe correspondent Kevin Connolly The October summit was always the first date in the EU calendar on which a gathering of the 27 heads of government could declare themselves satisfied with the Brexit divorce negotiations and agree to start talking about trade. It's been clear for weeks that they won't do that - but they will offer the UK some encouragement by starting internal discussions about future trade with the UK - ready for any breakthrough at the next summit in December. Theresa May isn't expected to make any big new proposal in her after-dinner remarks but to underline the quality of the financial offer made in her speech in Florence - worth around Â£20bn. The EU side wants more though - more money as well as further movement on citizens rights and the Irish border. There are almost as many predictions about what happens next as there are diplomats in Brussels; one has suggested that the prospects of a December breakthrough are no better than fifty-fifty but an official close to the talks said the signal on Brexit from this summit would be fundamentally positive. Kuenssberg: Whiff of foreboding about Brexit talks Before leaving for Brussels, Mrs May used aFacebook,externalpost to offer further assurances to the three million or so nationals of other EU countries living in the UK and uncertain about their future after Brexit. In the open letter, which was also mailed to 100,000 EU nationals, she said those who already had permanent residence would be able to ""swap this"" for settled status in as hassle-free a way as possible. The process of applying for permanent residency, for which EU nationals are eligible after five years, has long been criticised as cumbersome and overly bureaucratic. At one point, it involved filling out an 85-page form. Theresa May says the future of British and EU nationals has always been her ""first priority"" In simplifying it, Mrs May said she was committed to putting ""people first"" in the negotiations and expected British nationals living on the continent to be treated in the same way. ""I know both sides will consider each other's proposals with an open mind and with flexibility and creativity on both sides, I am confident we can conclude discussions on citizens' rights in the coming weeks,"" she said. Nicolas Hatton, of the 3million pressure group formed to fight for the rights of EU nationals in the UK, described the PM's statement as ""very positive"", but said its timing was ""a bit more dubious"". ""We should have received that letter maybe 12 months ago so we would not have felt so anxious about our future"" he said, adding: ""I think the letter was actually addressed to EU leaders."" This video can not be played Vince Cable on progress of UK-EU Brexit talks This video can not be played Thornberry: Labour will not accept a no-deal Brexit Meanwhile a group of pro-Brexit Tory and Labour politicians - including former Chancellor Lord Lawson, former Conservative minister Owen Paterson and Labour MP Kate Hoey - is urging Mrs May to walk away from negotiations this week if the EU does not accommodate the UK's wishes. In the event of no progress at Thursday's meeting, the letter, organised by the Leave Means Leave campaign, says Mrs May should formally declare the UK is working on the assumption it will be reverting to World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules on 30 March 2019. Creative sector warns of Brexit threat Brexit: All you need to know 'More delays' to key Brexit bill Mr Paterson told the Today programme the UK should not be ""terrified"" of leaving the EU without a deal in place, saying this appeared ""inevitable at the moment"" due to the EU's ""complete obsession with money"" - the so-called Brexit divorce bill. But Labour's Brexit spokesman, Sir Keir Starmer, said it would be ""irresponsible"" to threaten to walk away with the talks only at ""phase one"". He added that Labour was not ""duty bound"" to support any deal the PM secures with Brussels. Sir Keir and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn are also in Brussels for their own talks with EU officials.

"Many protesters are highly critical of the Gupta family UK financial regulators and the Serious Fraud Office are to review if banks HSBC and Standard Chartered are linked to a South Africa corruption scandal. It comes after Lord Peter Hain said the banks may ""inadvertently have been conduits"" for laundered money. The Labour peer told the House of Lords that up to Â£400m of illicit funds may have been moved by the banks. His concerns relate to links between South Africa's President Jacob Zuma and a wealthy business family, the Guptas. The peer has written to the Chancellor Philip Hammond, telling him a whistle-blower had indicated the banks ""maybe inadvertently have been conduits for the corrupt proceeds of money"". Lord Hain told the BBC he named 27 people in the letter, in addition to companies, adding that any person or firm linked to alleged corruption in South Africa is ""going to be badly contaminated"". The Treasury has referred Lord Hain's letter to regulators, including the Financial Conduct Authority, and the SFO. A Treasury spokesman said: ""We take allegations of financial misconduct very seriously, and have passed Lord Hain's letter on to the Financial Conduct Authority and relevant UK law enforcement agencies, including the National Crime Agency and Serious Fraud Office, to agree the right action."" The BBC's correspondent in Johannesburg, Andrew Harding, said Lord Hain's letter was ""a new twist in a giant corruption scandal that is shaking the South Africa state, and damaging the reputations of a number of global companies"". How the Guptas' brand turned toxic Who are the Guptas? Zuma and the Guptas - the Zuptas Mr Zuma and the Guptas strongly deny wrongdoing, and say they are victims of a ""politically motivated witch-hunt"". But leaked emails and official investigations have fuelled claims that the Guptas have bought influence in government in order to loot state enterprises. In South Africa, the scandal has already ruined British public relations company Bell Pottinger and damaged auditors KPMG, which removed its top executive team in the country. Bell Pottinger goes into administration KPMG clears out South African management A spokeswoman for the FCA said it was already in contact with the banks named by Lord Hain and would ""consider carefully further responses received"". Standard Chartered said: ""We are not able to comment on the details of client transactions, but can confirm that following an internal investigation accounts were closed by us in 2014."" HSBC declined to comment. Lord Hain, a leading anti-apartheid campaigner who grew up in South Africa, urged UK authorities ""to track that stolen money down and make sure that British financial institutions help return it to South African taxpayers"". It is claimed that money was taken out of South Africa via Hong Kong and Dubai. Lord Hain, a former Northern Ireland secretary, alleged in his letter to the chancellor that the issue was ""a result of the corruption and cronyism presided over by President Zuma and close allies the Guptas"". During his Lords statement, the peer asked what steps the government was taking to prevent money laundering through UK banks. The minister, Lord Bates, said the UK is ""committed"" to fighting money laundering and is ""concerned"" at the allegations. He added that the high commission in South Africa is ""monitoring the issue closely"". Meanwhile, the Financial Times on Thursdayreported that the FBI,externalhad opened an investigation into possible links between the Guptas and ""individuals, bank accounts, and companies in the US"". The Gupta brothers Ajay, Atul and Rajesh Gupta have interests in computer, mining, media, travel, energy and technology and employ about 10,000 people through their company Sahara Group.

"Sgt Johnson's widow with his coffin at Miami International Airport The Donald Trump condolence-call story is a White House headache that shows no signs of abating. It started badly for the president, as he responded to a question about US military casualties in Niger by questioning how his predecessors dealt with the families of war dead. It got worse, as the story morphed into one of an allegedly callous presidential call to Myeshia Johnson, a grieving widow of one of the US soldiers killed in Niger. Now it's devolved into a he-said, she said debate, with Democratic Congresswoman Frederica Wilson - who knew the slain soldier - and Ms Johnson and her family claiming the president mishandled the call, while Mr Trump and chief of staff John Kelly insist everything went smoothly. Needless to say, arguing with a war widow is a no-win situation, regardless of who has facts on their side. President George W Bush notably withstood harsh criticism from some bereaved families during the Iraq War without swiping back. Trump was insensitive - soldier's mother This president is different, which should come as a surprise to no one at this point. His choices could come at a political high price, however. Here are five reasons why. Mr Trump campaigned on being a defender of the US military and, in particular, US veterans. Time and again he said those in the armed services weren't being treated well and railed against ongoing evidence of bureaucratic bungling in the veterans' health system. As a candidate and as president, he has boasted of how much the military loves him and regularly surrounded himself with soldiers and martial symbolism - a way of burnishing his credentials as a strong commander-in-chief. He appointed ex-generals to his administration and lined his redecorated Oval Office with flags. Now he has to deal with accusations that he is dishonouring the memory of service member who died on his watch. Questions are already swirling about why these soldiers were put in harm's way and whether enough was done to ensure their safety. This video can not be played Congresswoman Frederica Wilson: ""How insensitive can you be?"" Reporters are digging into other contacts Mr Trump has had with the families of slain soldiers. One widow hasreleased a recording of her call,externalwith the president. Accordingto The Atlantic,external, at least 11 of the 46 families had received neither a letter nor a call from the president. One father told the Washington Post Mr Trump had promised him a personal cheque for $25,000 (Â£18,900) but hadn't delivered. The White House has since announced the money is on the way. Some families who have heard nothing said they were angry. The next time the president surrounds himself with soldiers, the public might be reminded of this - and become angry, too. An important job of a modern US president is to serve as ""consoler-in-chief""; a stable, reassuring voice in times of national distress or tragedy. This can take place on a large scale - when visiting the site of a natural disaster or high-profile accident - or small, in comforting a family member grieving over their loss. It's a skill that successful politicians learn early on - the human touch - and anti-politician Trump is having a difficult time with it. In the days after Puerto Rico was struck by a massive hurricane, he was tweeting about the territory's pre-existing financial mismanagement and escalating a feud with San Juan's mayor. This video can not be played Donald Trump said Mrs Khan had nothing to say, as David Willis reports In the hours after a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville led to violent clashes and the death of a counter-protester, Mr Trump gave a statement about how there was blame on both sides. Charlottesville: What made Trump remarks so offensive? Mr Trump responded to the militant attack on London Bridge by criticising the city's mayor. He's responded to other attacks, foreign and domestic, by claiming they vindicated his policy proscriptions. The president has also developed a reputation for getting embroiled in petty disputes. His counter-puncher mentality, while it has served him well against his presidential rivals, also has led him into spats with a former beauty queen, celebrities, sports stars, major companies, prominent journalists, members of his own party and the parents of a Muslim-American soldier killed in Iraq. That last one seems pretty relevant at this point. Father of Muslim soldier rebukes Trump Trump attacks McCain's war record It's worth remembering that this whole swirling story started because Mr Trump was asked why four US soldiers had died in Niger and why it took him so long to respond. In fact, it had been 12 days and the president had issued no statement - tweet, comment or White House release - about the incident whatsoever. Mr Trump defended himself by taking an (inaccurate) shot at his predecessors for not making similar calls. Although he later backed away from such a sweeping statement, the following day he told a reporter to ask his chief of staff, John Kelly if he had received a call from President Obama. This video can not be played Trump denigrates Obama over false fallen soldier claim Mr Kelly's son had been killed in Afghanistan, and the ex-general has been reluctant to publicly discuss details of his grief. The White House said he hadn't been called, but it was later revealed that he attended an event for Gold Star families - parents of slain soldiers - hosted by the Obama administration. Then the president called Johnson's widow, and ... didn't help the situation. Now he's in a war of words with a sharp-tongued Democratic congresswoman over a story that, however one slices it, does not paint the president in a good light. When Mr Kelly defended the president later that week, he insisted the president handled a difficult call well - although he confirmed that Mr Trump did say the slain soldier ""knew what he signed up for"". Since then, the president has seemingly enjoyed trading barbs with Congresswoman Wilson, calling her ""wacky"" and a ""disaster"" for Democrats. When Ms Johnson insisted in a television interview that Ms Wilson's account was correct - and that the president didn't even know her husband's name - the president took to Twitter within hours to say she was incorrect. Mr Trump once again has shown that he doesn't believe in the Law of Holes - that when you're in a hole, you stop digging. Instead he seems to think that if he keeps digging long enough, he'll come out on the other side. This story could have been nipped in the bud early, with some sort of presidential statement of condolence shortly after the 4 October Niger incident. In fact,according to,externalPolitico, a release had been drafted and circulated within the National Security Council on 5 October - but it never saw the light of day. During Wednesday's White House press conference, Sarah Huckabee Sanders said that there were administration protocols that had to be followed before the names of slain US servicemen could be released - but that wouldn't have applied to the draft statement responding to reports, which didn't mention the soldiers' names. This video can not be played Gold Star Mother Christina Ayube: ""We don't need to be reminded of that on the way to receiving the body"" ""Somebody screwed up here, OK?"" Leon Panetta, who served as defence secretary and CIA chief in the Obama administration, told The Washington Post. ""You don't let that amount of time pass when our men and women in uniform have been killed."" Compounding matters was that it appears Mr Trump went into the conversation with Johnson's widow without a clear script. It's not outside the realm of possibility that while Mr Trump's intentions were good, his preparation was poor - and he misspoke or made comments open to misinterpretation. Since Mr Trump first brought up his contacts with the Gold Star families, the White Househas reportedly been scrambling to send out presidential letters,externalof condolences to those who had not yet received them. According to aleaked Pentagon document,external, the administration didn't even have a current list of slain military personnel when the president told reporters he had spoken with ""virtually"" all of them. All of this could have been avoided with more careful planning. A White House meltdown in the making It's a(nother) distraction This is a big month for Mr Trump. If he wants to see Congress pass a tax cut before the end of the year, the coming weeks will be when it gets off the ground. Democrats are pushing hard to paint the proposal as an unaffordable sop to the rich - and Republicans need to get their message out before public opinion is solidified. Donald Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell have a lot of work ahead of them this month The president also took a high-risk gamblein ending cost-sharing subsidiesthat help insurance companies provide affordable policies to less affluent Americans. Without congressional action, some premiums could skyrocket. If Mr Trump isn't vigorous in defending his decision, he'll be the one that takes the brunt of the blame. The federal budget process is heating up as well. Although the day of fiscal reckoning was pushed back to the end of December thanks to a deal with the Democrats, that deadline is growing closer every day. If the president wants to see funds for his priorities, like the Mexican border wall, he'll need to be fully engaged in congressional negotiations. Speaking of negotiations, talks with Mexico and Canada to modify the North America Trade Agreement are hanging by a thread. If they fall apart, the president may have to make the case to the public that pulling out of the deal won't do lasting harm to the US economy. All the oxygen in Washington is being sucked up by the condolence-call story, however. Although Mr Trump likes to tout his presidential accomplishments, his record so far is bereft of legislative victories. Recent events have done little to help his cause.

"Author Philip Pullman is returning to the world of Lyra Belacqua with his new trilogy The Book of Dust, the first instalment of which was released at midnight. La Belle Sauvage: The Book Of Dust Volume One is published on Thursday, Pullman's 71st birthday, and comes 17 years after the last instalment of his previous trilogy. While Lyra, from His Dark Materials, is one of the key characters, the action takes place when she is six months old. She is being sheltered by nuns but then 11-year-old Malcolm Polstead steps in to protect her on his canoe, La Belle Sauvage. So what are the tricks of the trade that has made Pullman such a success - and the tips he can pass on to budding writers? He spoke to the BBC about his lucky pen and why he can work to the sound of a pneumatic drill, but never to music. Philip Pullman: ""I like being in a state of doubt"" It's a mysterious process. Of course, part of me must be making them up. But it doesn't feel like making up - it feels like discovery. Basically, I sit at my desk and stare at the wall blankly until I find my pen moving over the paper, for want of any better word. I don't want to get all mystical about it, but it does feel like discovery rather than invention. It's like the story is already there and I've got to find the best way to tell it, rather than make it up. It's a curious business and I'm not at all sure about it, but I don't want to be sure about it really. I like being in a state of doubt. This video can not be played Seventeen years after His Dark Materials, author Philip Pullman reads from its new ""equel"" After I'd finished His Dark Materials, I had a sense there were more stories there. Lyra's story that I tell in His Dark Materials, that's come to an end, that's finished. But there are always other stories. At the end of His Dark Materials, Lyra is only 12 years old, and she's going to grow up and she's going to be an adult. Things are going to happen to her and she's going to make things happen. And I was curious about that. At the edge of my vision, so to speak, out of the corner of my eye, I could see other characters which I became interested in. I gradually found my pen wandering over to that other world again. I had done quite a lot of other things, but this new story became so compelling and so interesting - and the new characters were so attractive to me - that I just couldn't resist. Pullman said he ""couldn't resist"" the characters in his new book I never think it (my writing) is good. The most I think is, ""Well, that will do"". When I'm writing, I'm more conscious of the sound, actually, than the meaning. I know what the rhythm of the sentence is going to be before I know what the words are going to be in it. That's a very important factor in the way I write. That's why I can't write with music playing. Some writers do, but I couldn't begin to do that. Silence? Yes. Pneumatic drills? Fine. Traffic noise? No problem. But music is an absolute killer. So I have to have silence, so I can hear the rhythm. I sort of know where things are going - but I don't know the way to get there. As for not structuring - well, I do. But structure comes later. Structure is sometimes seen as being a fundamental thing. It isn't. Structure is a superficial thing. What is fundamental in a book is tone, the tone of voice, and to change that is to change every single sentence. But you can change the structure at the last minute. You can say: ""I'll start in the middle"", or whatever. The structure is there, but it comes later. Pullman says he writes with a pen and paper rather than straight on to the computer I use a ballpoint pen and paper, initially. I do that because I know it works - and I've got a lucky pen. It's a Mont Blanc ballpoint. I use it because it's a perfect weight and a perfect size. And it works. I've written several books with it. I couldn't do without it now. If I lost it, I don't know what I'd do. So I do that first. Then every chapter or two I put on the computer, because that's the best editing tool ever invented. When you're writing, you have to please yourself because there's no-one else there initially. But the book doesn't fully exist until it's been read. The reader is a very important part of the transaction - and people have to read things they want to read. I'm writing for me - I write for all the ""me's"" that have been. From the first me I can remember, the me who first got interested in stories and loved listening to them; to the me who was here at Oxford 50 years ago; to the me who was a school teacher, telling stories to the class. All of these. I'm writing for me. And I am lucky to have found such a wide audience - and an audience which contains both adults and children is the best of all.

"Losses of rare insects are well documented, but there is little research on insects as a whole It's known as the windscreen phenomenon. When you stop your car after a drive, there seem to be far fewer squashed insects than there used to be. Scientists have long suspected that insects are in dramatic decline, but new evidence confirms this. Research at more than 60 protected areas in Germany suggests flying insects have declined by more than 75% over almost 30 years. And the causes are unknown. ""This confirms what everybody's been having as a gut feeling - the windscreen phenomenon where you squash fewer bugs as the decades go by,"" said Caspar Hallmann of Radboud University in The Netherlands. ""This is the first study that looked into the total biomass of flying insects and it confirms our worries.'' The study is based on measurements of the biomass of all insects trapped at 63 nature protection areas in Germany over 27 years since 1989. The data includes thousands of different insects, such as bees, butterflies and moths. Scientists say the dramatic decline was seen regardless of habitat, land use and the weather, leaving them at a loss to explain what was behind it. They stressed the importance of adopting measures known to be beneficial for insects, including strips of flowers around farmland and minimising the effects of intensive agriculture. And they said there was an urgent need to uncover the causes and extent of the decline in all airborne insects. ""We don't know exactly what the causes are,'' said Hans de Kroon, also of Radboud University, who supervised the research. ''This study shows how important it is to have good monitoring programmes and we need more research right now to look into those causes - so, that has really high priority.'' The finding was even more worrying given that it was happening in nature reserves, which are meant to protect insects and other living species, the researchers said. ''In the modern agricultural landscape, for insects it's a hostile environment, it's a desert, if not worse,'' said Dr de Kroon. ''And the decline there has been well documented. The big surprise is that it is also happening in adjacent nature reserves.'' Insects provide vital services like pollination The loss of insects has far-reaching consequences for entire ecosystems. Insects provide a food source for many birds, amphibians, bats and reptiles, while plants rely on insects for pollination. The decline is more severe than found in previous studies. A survey of insects at four sites in the UK between 1973 and 2002 found losses at one of the four sites only. Dr Lynn Dicks, from the University of East Anglia, UK, who is not connected with the study, said the paper provides new evidence for ""an alarming decline"" that many entomologists have suspected for some time. ""If total flying insect biomass is genuinely declining at this rate (around 6% per year), it is extremely concerning,"" she said. ""Flying insects have really important ecological functions, for which their numbers matter a lot."" The research is published in the journal Plos One. Follow Helen onTwitter,external.

"This video can not be played O'Neill's lawyer said it had been an ""error of judgement"" Northern Ireland football manager Michael O'Neill has pleaded guilty at Edinburgh Sheriff Court to drink-driving. The court heard he was caught by police in the early hours of 10 September at three times the Scottish drink-drive limit. He had been stopped while driving on the outskirts of the city. Sheriff Thomas Welsh QC fined O'Neill Â£1,300 and banned him from driving for 16 months. Prosecutor Chloe Shoniwa told the court that police officers had ""reason to stop"" O'Neill as he drove on the A720 Edinburgh city bypass between Lothianburn and Straiton. O'Neill was breathalysed and he was found to have a breath alcohol level of 65mcg - the legal limit in Scotland is 22mcg. Solicitor James Mulgrew, representing O'Neill, told the court: ""This was simply a bad error of judgement on the part of Mr O'Neill."" O'Neill, who lives in Edinburgh, is currently preparing Northern Ireland for the World Cup play-offs - a two-legged home and away tie against Switzerland next month. In a statement last month, the Irish Football Association (IFA) said it was ""aware of an alleged drink-driving incident involving Michael O'Neill"". During his playing career, O'Neill won 31 caps for Northern Ireland and scored four international goals. The midfielder started out playing for Irish League club Coleraine and went on to play for Newcastle United, Dundee United and Hibernian.

"Whether crime is rising or falling is hugely important. It can affect how much is spent on policing and other related services, even how people vote. But working out what is happening is not an exact science. When we talk about crime rates in England and Wales we usually look at two things: crimes recorded by the police crimes reported in anannual survey,externalof 38,000 members of the public And those two sources often throw up quite different results. For example, in recent years police records have shown significant increases in crime while the survey has suggested crime is falling. Despite this difference, neither source is wrong - they just measure different things. The more difficult question is which best represents how much crime is actually being committed. We're talking about England and Wales only, because Scotland and Northern Ireland have separate criminal justice systems. According to the most recent survey, which is conducted face-to-face and asks individuals about their personal experiences, levels of crime in the year to September 2018 remained pretty stable compared with the year before. Crimes recorded by the survey have been falling for years, so this represents a slowing of improvements. There was no change in the overall number of violent offences - the only significant change was seen in the category of ""computer misuse"" (generally fraud and financial crimes), which went down by a third. On the other hand, police records suggest crime went up by 7% in the past year  and violent crime went up by 19%. Violence that actually resulted in injury or death went up by 7%. So which of these two very different pictures - one showing no change to the levels of violence people are experiencing and one showing it going up quite considerably - should we trust? The crime survey is generally considered a good measure of crime experienced by individuals because it is not affected by changes to how crime is recorded. It also includes crimes that have historically been under-reported to the police. However, it has some limitations. It does not cover crimes against businesses or people living in communal residences like care homes, prisons or student accommodation. It is also excludes crimes where there is no victim to interview, for example murders and drug possession or dealing offences. And there is a time-lag in the survey, so the figures are older than police figures. This means the survey is very good for looking at long-term trends but less good at spotting emerging ones. The trouble with police records is they can sometimes be a measure of police activity rather than of crime itself. They're by definition not good at capturing offences that people under-report to the police, such as petty theft or sexual offences. They are skewed by police priorities - that is, focused efforts from police to tackle certain crimes can also lead to higher levels being recorded. And police-recorded crime is sensitive to changes in recording practices, for example, the number of crimes described as ""violence against the person"" went up considerably in recent years, after two new harassment offences were added to the category. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said this didn't reflect a genuine increase in crime. Police recorded crime had its designation as a national statistic removed in 2014. But, that being said, police-recorded crime is very good measure of what's happening to well understood and well reported crimes such as burglary. Those figures suggest there have been genuine increases in less common but more serious crimes such as weapons offences over the past couple of years. Helen Ross from the ONS's centre for crime and justice, said: ""In recent decades, we've seen the overall level of crime falling - but in the last year, it remained level."" ""Burglary, shoplifting and computer misuse are decreasing but others, such as vehicle offences and robbery, are rising. ""We have also seen increases in some types of 'lower-volume, high-harm' violence, including offences involving knives or sharp instruments."" But, the statistical body says, this should be seen in the context of an overall fall in crime over the past decade, adding that the crime survey ""provides the best measure of trends for overall violent crime"". ""The survey covers crimes that are not reported to or recorded by the police and so tends to provide the better measure of more common but less harmful crimes."" Scotland has a similar survey on perceptions of crime that runs every two years. In the most recent survey, for 2016-17, crimes committed against adults were down 34% since 2008-09 and 16% since the previous survey, in 2012-13. Crimes recorded by the police in Scotland are at their lowest level since 1974.

"In August 2017, a deadly crackdown by Myanmar's army on Rohingya Muslims sent hundreds of thousands fleeing across the border into Bangladesh. They risked everything to escape by sea or on foot a military offensive which the United Nations later described as a ""textbook example of ethnic cleansing"". In January 2020, the UN's top court ordered the Buddhist-majority country to take measures to protect members of its Rohingya community from genocide. But the army in Myanmar (formerly Burma) has said it was fighting Rohingya militants and denies targeting civilians. The country's leader Aung San Suu Kyi, once a human rights icon, has repeatedly denied allegations of genocide. Described by UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres as ""one of, if not the, most discriminated people in the world"", the Rohingya are one of Myanmar's many ethnic minorities. The Rohingya, who numbered around one million in Myanmar at the start of 2017, are one of the many ethnic minorities in the country. Rohingya Muslims represent the largest percentage of Muslims in Myanmar, with the majority living in Rakhine state. They have their own language and culture and say they are descendants of Arab traders and other groups who have been in the region for generations. The country where Facebook posts whipped up hate But the government of Myanmar, a predominantly Buddhist country, denies the Rohingya citizenship and even excluded them from the 2014 census, refusing to recognise them as a people. It sees them as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh. Since the 1970s, Rohingya have migrated across the region in significant numbers. Estimates of their numbers are often much higher than official figures. In the last few years, before the latest crisis, thousands of Rohingya made perilous journeys out of Myanmar to escape communal violence or alleged abuses by the security forces. The exodus began on 25 August 2017 after Rohingya Arsa militants launched deadly attacks on more than 30 police posts. Rohingyas arriving in Bangladesh said they fled after troops, backed by local Buddhist mobs, responded by burning their villages and attacking and killing civilians. At least 6,700 Rohingya, including at least 730 children under the age of five, were killed in the month after the violence broke out, according to medical charity MÃ©decins Sans FrontiÃ¨res (MSF). Amnesty International says the Myanmar military also raped and abused Rohingya women and girls. This video can not be played The BBC saw the remains of burned villages on a tightly controlled government trip to Rakhine state The government, which puts the number of dead at 400, claims that ""clearance operations"" against the militants ended on 5 September, butBBC correspondents have seen evidencethat they continued after that date. At least 288 villages were partially or totally destroyed by fire in northern Rakhine state after August 2017, according to analysis of satellite imagery by Human Rights Watch. The imagery shows many areas where Rohingya villages were reduced to smouldering rubble, while nearby ethnic Rakhine villages were left intact. Human Rights Watch say most damage occurred in Maungdaw Township, between 25 August and 25 September 2017 - with many villages destroyed after 5 September, when Myanmar's de facto leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, said security force operations had ended. A report published by UN investigators in August 2018 accused Myanmar's military of carrying out mass killings and rapes with ""genocidal intent"". The ICJ case, lodged by the small Muslim-majority nation of The Gambia, in West Africa, on behalf of dozens of other Muslim countries, called for emergency measures to be taken against the Myanmar military, known as Tatmadaw, until a fuller investigation could be launched. Aung San Suu Kyi rejected allegations of genocide when she appeared at the court in December 2019. This video can not be played How did this peace icon end up at a genocide trial? But in January 2020, the court's initial ruling ordered Myanmar to take emergency measures to protect the Rohingya from being persecuted and killed. While the ICJ only rules on disputes between states, the International Criminal Court (ICC) has the authority to try individuals accused of war crimes or crimes against humanity. The body approved a full investigation into the case of the Rohingya in Myanmar in November. Although Myanmar itself is not a member of the court, the ICC ruled it had jurisdiction in the case because Bangladesh, where victims fled to, is a member. Will Omar get justice for his murdered family? Myanmar has long denied carrying out genocide and says it is carrying out its own investigations into the events of 2017. The country's Independent Commission of Enquiry (ICOE) admitted that members of the security forces may have carried out ""war crimes, serious human rights violations, and violations of domestic law"", but claimed there was no evidence of genocide. Its full report has not yet been released, but questions have been raised. With more than half a million Rohingya believed to still be living in Myanmar's northern Rakhine province, UN investigators have warned there is a ""serious risk that genocidal actions may occur or recur"". The situation that led to ""killings, rapes and gang rapes, torture, forced displacement and other grave rights violations"" in 2017 remained unchanged, the investigators said in September, blaming a lack of accountability and Myanmar's failure to fully investigate allegations or criminalise genocide. Rakhine province itself is the site of an ongoing conflict between the army and rebels from the Buddhist-majority Rakhine ethnic group. The massive numbers of refugees who fled to Bangladesh in 2017 joined hundreds of thousands of Rohingya who had fled Myanmar in previous years. Kutupalong, the largest refugee settlement in the world according to UNHCR, is home to more than 600,000 refugees alone. But in March 2019,Bangladesh announced it would no longer accept Rohingyafleeing Myanmar. While an agreement for the return of refugees was reached in early 2018, none returned. They said they would not consider going back to Myanmar unless they were given guarantees they would be given citizenship. What awaits any Rohingya refugees who return to Myanmar? And as a BBC investigation showed, even those considering returning in the future may not be able to, withvillages destroyed to make way for government facilities.

You're just giving her water but she wants food and you can't. She had no food Saturday, Sunday, went to school really, really, hungry."" Anna, from Hammersmith in west London, says she was told to apply online and the first payment would take up to three months to arrive. This was despite the government's expectation that claimants should be paid within six weeks - a target which has itself attracted criticism. The government says universal credit, which rolls six working-age benefits into a single payment, is designed to make the system simpler and ensure no-one faces a situation where they would be better off claiming benefits than working. Anna says all of her current benefits were stopped - child benefit, child tax credit, income support, council tax and housing benefits - whilst she waited for them to be grouped under the new system. Senior Labour backbencher Frank Field told the Victoria Derbyshire programme claimants were being ""pushed into destitution"". He called on the government to temporarily halt the ""disastrous"" roll-out. ""What we're seeing is increased numbers who are hungry, increased numbers of people who can't pay their rent, and an increase in the number who are without fuel or light in their housesâ¦ those numbers [of people in destitution] are rising,"" he said. A volunteer packing items for a food bank Anna says she had to go to a food bank for supplies - otherwise they would still be hungry. ""I can't go to the shop and steal. It's awful. I can't keep asking neighbours for food, I shouldn't have to live like this,"" she says. ""I don't know if I am going to still have my house, as I need to pay my rent, my council tax is due. What do I do next? Beg on the street to get some milk and bread?"" The Trussell Trust says its network of 400 food banks may be unable to cope with the rise in demand resulting from the introduction of universal credit. ""We're genuinely worried that with the combined demands of winter and [the fallout from universal credit] we might not be able to feed everyone who comes through our doors,"" says Gareth Lemon, from the charity. The government has said anyone in financial distress can apply for advance payments. But these payment are only a type of loan, which claimants have to pay back from subsequent instalments. For some, the requirement to pay back an advance, has itself resulted in them slipping into debt. Brendan said his sisters helped him buy food after problems with his benefit payments Brendan, 51, from West Yorkshire, who has a range of disabilities and is awaiting bariatric surgery, says the failure to be paid the housing element of universal credit has left him thousands of pounds in arrears and facing eviction. He took an advance while waiting for his first instalment but is now paying that back, exacerbating his debt problems. ""It probably lasted me about two weeks and then left me with nothing. Then you're hoping that what you have in is enough, which it wasn't. I've got a good family who have helped me out a lot. Without my sisters I'd be absolutely on my knees,"" he says. Brendan says he went without food for three days, until his sister took him shopping and gave him some money. ""She said, 'If you're ever like this again, phone me'. But I won't because it's embarrassing,"" he adds. ""I've never struggled like this before in my life I've never been in this situation where I could lose my home. I'll die on those streets if I do get evicted, I don't know what I'll do. I don't know where to go for help."" Ed Boyd, managing director at the Centre for Social Justice, which designed the policy, insisted that the government should be congratulated for introducing universal credit, saying that it is far better than the system it replaces. He said the old system disincentivised work and trapped people on benefits. ""When universal credit is fully rolled out you will have 250,000-to-300,000 more people in work and the effect this will have on families across the country, taking people out of poverty, is really significant,"" he says. The Department for Work and Pensions says its latest data, from last month, indicates 81% of new claimants were paid in full and on time at the end of their first assessment while 89% received some payment. Cases of non-payment, it said, were due to claimants either not signing paperwork, not passing identity checks or facing ""verification issues,"" such as providing details of their earnings, housing costs and childcare costs.

"In August 2017, a deadly crackdown by Myanmar's army on Rohingya Muslims sent hundreds of thousands fleeing across the border into Bangladesh. They risked everything to escape by sea or on foot a military offensive which the United Nations later described as a ""textbook example of ethnic cleansing"". In January 2020, the UN's top court ordered the Buddhist-majority country to take measures to protect members of its Rohingya community from genocide. But the army in Myanmar (formerly Burma) has said it was fighting Rohingya militants and denies targeting civilians. The country's leader Aung San Suu Kyi, once a human rights icon, has repeatedly denied allegations of genocide. Described by UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres as ""one of, if not the, most discriminated people in the world"", the Rohingya are one of Myanmar's many ethnic minorities. The Rohingya, who numbered around one million in Myanmar at the start of 2017, are one of the many ethnic minorities in the country. Rohingya Muslims represent the largest percentage of Muslims in Myanmar, with the majority living in Rakhine state. They have their own language and culture and say they are descendants of Arab traders and other groups who have been in the region for generations. The country where Facebook posts whipped up hate But the government of Myanmar, a predominantly Buddhist country, denies the Rohingya citizenship and even excluded them from the 2014 census, refusing to recognise them as a people. It sees them as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh. Since the 1970s, Rohingya have migrated across the region in significant numbers. Estimates of their numbers are often much higher than official figures. In the last few years, before the latest crisis, thousands of Rohingya made perilous journeys out of Myanmar to escape communal violence or alleged abuses by the security forces. The exodus began on 25 August 2017 after Rohingya Arsa militants launched deadly attacks on more than 30 police posts. Rohingyas arriving in Bangladesh said they fled after troops, backed by local Buddhist mobs, responded by burning their villages and attacking and killing civilians. At least 6,700 Rohingya, including at least 730 children under the age of five, were killed in the month after the violence broke out, according to medical charity MÃ©decins Sans FrontiÃ¨res (MSF). Amnesty International says the Myanmar military also raped and abused Rohingya women and girls. This video can not be played The BBC saw the remains of burned villages on a tightly controlled government trip to Rakhine state The government, which puts the number of dead at 400, claims that ""clearance operations"" against the militants ended on 5 September, butBBC correspondents have seen evidencethat they continued after that date. At least 288 villages were partially or totally destroyed by fire in northern Rakhine state after August 2017, according to analysis of satellite imagery by Human Rights Watch. The imagery shows many areas where Rohingya villages were reduced to smouldering rubble, while nearby ethnic Rakhine villages were left intact. Human Rights Watch say most damage occurred in Maungdaw Township, between 25 August and 25 September 2017 - with many villages destroyed after 5 September, when Myanmar's de facto leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, said security force operations had ended. A report published by UN investigators in August 2018 accused Myanmar's military of carrying out mass killings and rapes with ""genocidal intent"". The ICJ case, lodged by the small Muslim-majority nation of The Gambia, in West Africa, on behalf of dozens of other Muslim countries, called for emergency measures to be taken against the Myanmar military, known as Tatmadaw, until a fuller investigation could be launched. Aung San Suu Kyi rejected allegations of genocide when she appeared at the court in December 2019. This video can not be played How did this peace icon end up at a genocide trial? But in January 2020, the court's initial ruling ordered Myanmar to take emergency measures to protect the Rohingya from being persecuted and killed. While the ICJ only rules on disputes between states, the International Criminal Court (ICC) has the authority to try individuals accused of war crimes or crimes against humanity. The body approved a full investigation into the case of the Rohingya in Myanmar in November. Although Myanmar itself is not a member of the court, the ICC ruled it had jurisdiction in the case because Bangladesh, where victims fled to, is a member. Will Omar get justice for his murdered family? Myanmar has long denied carrying out genocide and says it is carrying out its own investigations into the events of 2017. The country's Independent Commission of Enquiry (ICOE) admitted that members of the security forces may have carried out ""war crimes, serious human rights violations, and violations of domestic law"", but claimed there was no evidence of genocide. Its full report has not yet been released, but questions have been raised. With more than half a million Rohingya believed to still be living in Myanmar's northern Rakhine province, UN investigators have warned there is a ""serious risk that genocidal actions may occur or recur"". The situation that led to ""killings, rapes and gang rapes, torture, forced displacement and other grave rights violations"" in 2017 remained unchanged, the investigators said in September, blaming a lack of accountability and Myanmar's failure to fully investigate allegations or criminalise genocide. Rakhine province itself is the site of an ongoing conflict between the army and rebels from the Buddhist-majority Rakhine ethnic group. The massive numbers of refugees who fled to Bangladesh in 2017 joined hundreds of thousands of Rohingya who had fled Myanmar in previous years. Kutupalong, the largest refugee settlement in the world according to UNHCR, is home to more than 600,000 refugees alone. But in March 2019,Bangladesh announced it would no longer accept Rohingyafleeing Myanmar. While an agreement for the return of refugees was reached in early 2018, none returned. They said they would not consider going back to Myanmar unless they were given guarantees they would be given citizenship. What awaits any Rohingya refugees who return to Myanmar? And as a BBC investigation showed, even those considering returning in the future may not be able to, withvillages destroyed to make way for government facilities.

"The number of crimes recorded annually in England and Wales has passed the five million mark for the first time in 10 years, rising by 13%, figures show. The Office for National Statistics said,externalcrimes in the 12 months to June were up from 4.6 million the previous year. It said crime categorised as ""violent"" rose by 19%, with rises in offences including stalking and harassment. The Crime Survey for England and Wales, based on people's experiences, suggests there were 10.8 million offences. The survey includes crimes that people do not report to police. When comparing like-for-like crimes, the survey reported a 9% reduction compared with the previous year. Rise in hate crime in England and Wales Reality Check: Is crime up or down? Crime calculator - what's your risk of being a victim? Have you been a recent victim of crime? Email us athaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external The rise in the ONS statistics, which cover the 12 months to the end of June, is the largest annual rise in a decade and continues a recent trend of crime increases. Both sets of data were released on the same day. John Flatley, from the ONS, said: ""While improvements made by police forces in recording crime are still a factor in the increase, we judge that there have been genuine increases in crime - particularly in some of the low incidence but more harmful categories."" But he said police figures alone cannot provide ""a good measure of all crime in society"". ""The recent increases in recorded crime need to be seen in the context of the overall decline in crime indicated by the Crime Survey for England and Wales,"" he said. The ONS report said: Knife crime was up 26% year-on-year Nearly half of the increase in knife crime was attributed to London Sexual offences were up 19% The number of homicides (cases of murder and manslaughter) increased by 46 to 629, excluding the terror attacks in London and Manchester There were 1.2 million crimes of violence against the person The 19% increase in ""violence against the person"" offences dealt with by police was ""driven largely"" by increases in the sub-categories of ""violence without injury"" (21%) and ""stalking and harassment"" (36%) and ""violence with injury"" (10%), the ONS said. This video can not be played Knife crime was up by 26% year-on-year - an increasing number of teenagers in London are being injured by knives Crime minister Sarah Newton said ""much"" of the rise in violent offences was down to better crime recording. However, she added: ""We know that some of this increase is likely to be genuine. Which is why have taken urgent action to stop these crimes and keep our communities safe. ""This week we began consulting on tough new laws to crack down on acid attacks and knife offences. Our Domestic Abuse Bill will help to bring this heinous crime out of the shadows and ensure victims receive both support and justice, as we invest Â£100m to prevent and confront violence against women and girls."" She said the government was also investing Â£1.9 billion to counter the cyber-threats. Scotland has a similar survey on perceptions of crime that runs every two years. In the most recent one,published in 2016,,externalcrimes committed against adults were down 16% since the previous survey in 2012-13. Crimes recorded by the police in Scotland are at their lowest level since 1974. When we talk about crime rates we usually look at two things: police records and the number of incidents reported in the annual 38,000-person Crime Survey for England and Wales. Neither is wrong but the more difficult question is which best represents how much crime is actually being committed. The Crime Survey is generally considered a good measure of crime experienced by individuals because it is not affected by changes to how crime is recorded. It also includes crimes that have historically been under-reported to the police. However, it has some limitations. It does not cover crimes against businesses or people living in communal residences like care homes, prisons or student accommodation. It is also excludes crimes where there is no victim to interview, for example murders and drug offences. Read more By Danny Shaw, BBC home affairs correspondent Three years ago the number of offences recorded by police in England and Wales fell to just over four million. Violent crime was on the decline and murders had fallen to levels not seen since the 1970s. Together with a continuing reduction in offences estimated by the Crime Survey, some commentators said it reflected fundamental societal changes and even went as far as to suggest that crime was going out of fashion. How different things are now. Much of the increase in police-recorded crime since then is undoubtedly due to changes in the way officers register offences after the Inspectorate of Constabulary found that 800,000 incidents - one in five of all crimes reported - were not being logged. But there are also real rises in the most serious types of violence - with killings and murders at the numbers they were nine years ago - and that is puzzling the experts. No-one knows why it's happening. One thing is certain though. It is putting huge additional demands on the police at a time when they are already very stretched. Reality Check: Is there more crime?

"A soldier at a checkpoint leading to the Maiwind district of Kandahar, where this attack took place At least 43 Afghan soldiers have been killed and nine wounded after two suicide bombers in Humvee armoured vehicles destroyed a military base in the southern province of Kandahar. Six are still missing and 10 militants are also said to have died. Separately, two members of the security forces died in a siege of police headquarters in the eastern province of Ghazni. The Taliban said they were behind the early morning bloodshed. The attacks are the third and fourth major assaults on Afghan security forces this week. Only two soldiers are known to have survived the Kandahar attack without injuries, AFP news agency reports.

"PSNI Chief Constable George Hamilton (left), Deputy Chief Constable Drew Harris (centre) and Assistant Chief Constable Mark Hamilton deny the allegations Three of Northern Ireland's most senior police officers are under investigation for alleged misconduct in public office and criminality that could amount to conspiracy to pervert the course of justice. Chief Constable George Hamilton and his deputy Drew Harris are being investigated by the Police Ombudsman. Assistant Chief Constable Mark Hamilton is also under investigation. In a statement, the PSNI said they ""completely refute the allegations"". Statement from the PSNI Statement from the Police Ombudsman Mr Hamilton said he was ""absolutely confident"" there would be no findings of misconduct against him or the other officers. The inquiry focuses on concerns about how the Police Service of Northern Ireland conducted an investigation into allegations of bribery and fraud in 2014. It includes allegations that entries in police notebooks and journals were changed. This video can not be played PSNI Chief Constable George Hamilton said he was confident no misconduct would be found In a statement to the BBC, the ombudsman's office confirmed ""a number of allegations"" had been made against a range of officers. BBC News NI has established that those under investigation include: PSNI Chief Constable George Hamilton Deputy Chief Constable Drew Harris Assistant Chief Constable Mark Hamilton The nature of the complaints and the seniority of those under scrutiny make this investigation unprecedented. In terms of current policing issues, it's considered to be the most serious investigation the Ombudsman's office has undertaken. The investigation was launched after the Police Ombudsman, Dr Michael Maguire, received complaints from seven people questioned as part of an investigation into allegations of bribery and misconduct in public office in the awarding of PSNI vehicle contracts. They included retired PSNI Assistant Chief Constable Duncan McCausland, and the former Chief Constable of West Yorkshire Police, Mark Gilmore. George Hamilton was appointed PSNI Chief Constable in May 2014 - he was previously Assistant Chief Constable They were questioned in June 2014. Eighteen months later, the public prosecution service informed them that none would face any charges. The Police Ombudsman has established a dedicated team of six investigators to examine the allegations about the PSNI investigation. ""They include allegations of criminality and misconduct in how this investigation was undertaken,"" added the Ombudsman's statement. It's understood the alleged criminality being investigated includes claims that entries in police notebooks and journals were changed. There are also claims that the PSNI didn't follow proper procedures to obtain warrants. Drew Harris was appointed Deputy Chief Constable in October 2014 A solicitor for those who lodged complaints said he believed there were a number of serious flaws in the way the PSNI conducted the investigation against his clients. ""It is our contention that there is evidence of serious criminal activity on the part of members of the PSNI,"" said Ernie Waterworth. ""It's an extremely serious allegation and I have to say my clients thought long and hard before going down this road."" Mr Hamilton told the media that he was confident the Police Ombudsman would ""vindicate"" him and the other officers. ""I've got confidence in the Police Ombudsman, let them do the job, let them vindicate us rather than me saying this because actually that's the way it's supposed to work,"" he added. The PSNI normally does not comment in detail on live investigations by the ombudsman, but on this occasion has robustly rejected the allegations. ""The Chief Constable, Deputy Chief Constable and other officers completely refute the allegations made against them and are strongly of the view that these complex investigations into the complainants were conducted with professionalism and integrity,"" said its statement. Mark Hamilton was appointed Assistant Chief Constable in July 2013 It said the PSNI ""acknowledges and supports the need for office of the Police Ombudsman to investigate these allegations and all officers are co-operating fully with the investigation"". Explaining its unusual decision to give a more detailed response, the statement said media coverage of the investigation ""has the potential to negatively impact on public confidence in policing"". Sources have told BBC News NI that the PSNI consulted a number of external criminal justice agencies throughout the 2014 investigation, which it was fully satisfied was conducted properly. The ombudsman has declared the investigation a ""critical incident"". That means it's considered a matter that ""could have a significant impact on the person making the complaint, on the police or on the wider community"". The PSNI said it had ""full confidence"" in the ombudsman to complete a thorough investigation, adding that he should be allowed to do so ""without ongoing public commentary"". The investigation is expected to take more than a year to complete.

"Marina Titova lays a carnation in memory of her great-great-uncle who died on Mudyug When British soldiers were sent to Russia after the Russian Revolution their main enemies were the Germans - their opponents in World War One - but they also found themselves fighting and imprisoning Bolsheviks. In the process they opened what Russians regard as the first concentration camp in their country. The boat sails down the River Dvina past onion-domed churches, lumber yards and logs floating in the water. Finally it reaches the open sea and an hour later a brown smudge appears on the horizon. Getting closer, I can make out a lighthouse and a few radio towers. As my companions and I jump off the boat and walk along a deserted beach a pack of dogs surrounds us, barking furiously. They are not used to visitors. The only people who live on this remote spot today are border guards and a couple of meteorologists. Back in the Soviet era, boatloads of day trippers came to the island of Mudyug to visit a museum. It was located among the remains of a prison camp - one very different from the scores of old Gulag outposts scattered across the Russian north and Siberia. For one thing, it was set up as far back as 1918.  Even more remarkably, the people in charge were were British and French. My colleague Natalia Golysheva, who grew up in the regional capital, Arkhangelsk - Archangel as it used to be known in English - says the place had a fearsome reputation. Locals called it Death Island. ""When I was little, people said if you don't behave, the Whites will come and take you to Mudyug,"" she says. ""I didn't understand but when I tried to ask questions - 'What is Mudyug? Who are the Whites?' - my grandmother just said shush and turned her face away, meaning the conversation was over."" The Whites were the anti-Bolshevik forces that emerged after the October Revolution in 1917. They got the name from the cream-coloured uniforms worn by higher ranks in the Tsarist army. Some were reactionary military officers who wanted to bring back the monarchy, others were moderate socialists, reformers, tradesmen, fishermen or peasants. When the Bolsheviks seized power in the autumn of 1917, Russia was still fighting in World War One, allied with Britain, France and the US against the Central Powers of Germany and Austria-Hungary and their Ottoman allies. However, Lenin had come to power promising supporters not only bread to eat and a share of the aristocrats' land, but also peace.  When he signed a peace treaty with Germany, Western governments acted rapidly to re-open this eastern front. British and French troops lining up in Arkhangelsk in 1919 Within months, tens of thousands of soldiers from Britain, the United States, France, Canada, Australia and other countries were ordered to Russia in what became known as the Allied Intervention. Some went to the south and far east of Russia and 14,000 troops under British command were sent to Arkhangelsk, near the Arctic Circle. The men were told their mission was to protect military stores and stop Germany from establishing a submarine base. But the foreign troops also took the side of the Whites in Russia's nascent Civil War. Some European politicians, such as Winston Churchill, worried about Communism spreading across Europe. Soon after the Allies docked in Arkhangelsk on 2 August 1918, they began locking people up. ""They didn't know who to trust or the difference between the Reds and Whites - so they decided to incarcerate anyone who seemed suspect,"" says Liudmila Novikova, a Moscow-based historian who has become an expert on the post-revolutionary period in the Russian north. Since the main prison in the town was overcrowded, potential troublemakers were shipped to the island of Mudyug, 70km (45 miles) away. The first batch of inmates had to build their own prison camp in this desolate, windswept place. Bolshevik prisoners in the prison camp on Mudyug island We walk along the beach past a rickety watchtower before taking a path through a pine forest.   It leads to some wooden barracks with rusty barbed wire on the windows. The door opens with a creak and we are inside a long dormitory with hundreds of beds, divided by panels of wood. Each seems as narrow as a coffin. Marina Titova, a young museum guide from Arkhangelsk who has joined us on the trip, sits on one of the beds, lost in thought. Her great-great-uncle Fyodor Oparin, a roofer, had been at the front fighting the Germans in World War One. He was only briefly reunited with his wife and small daughter before he was arrested and sent to Mudyug, accused of recruiting the men in his village into the Red Army. With few washing facilities and no change of clothes, inmates soon became infested with lice. Typhus spread like wildfire. Overall, about 1,000 people were imprisoned here and up to 300 died - either as a result of disease, or because they were shot or tortured to death. When we visit it is a muggy summer afternoon and the air is thick with midges. I dread to think what it would be like here during an Arctic winter when temperatures can reach -30C (-22F). Signs from the now abandoned museum point out the ""ice cells"", left open to the elements, where rebellious prisoners were punished and either perished or lost limbs to frostbite. Pavel Rasskazov, a radical journalist, spent several months on Mudyug. In his Prison Memoirs, which became a well-known and much-studied text in the Soviet era, he documented the appalling conditions and the lack of food. He describes how, when dried bread was distributed in the morning, ""starving, angry men with greedy eyes crawled all over the filthy, damp floor, full of spit, picking up each and every crumb"". Rasskazov managed to survive this place, unlike Marina's relative, Fyodor Oparin. According to one account, he tried to escape but was too weak to move fast and was shot as he ran. In another version of events, he was caught and executed the following day, along with 13 other prisoners. Fyodor Oparin with his wife, Marina Under some fir trees Marina has found a commemorative plaque to the men killed trying to escape. As she places two red carnations on the crumbling stone, a cloud of mist swirls through the trees and a soft rain falls. ""Perhaps it was just a coincidence,"" she says later. ""But it seemed like a greeting from the past, and maybe those prisoners who suffered here, who tried to survive, could see that they were being remembered."" In Soviet times these men were remembered more often. On a small hill by the camp, there is a 25m-high obelisk adorned with a red star and hammer and sickle. Some chunks of granite have fallen off but you can still read the inscription which says it was built ""in honour of patriots tortured to death by the Interventionists"". ""This monument could be seen by all the ships sailing past,"" says historian Liudmila Novikova. ""Foreign sailors who came to Arkhangelsk were often taken to Mudyug to remind them of all the atrocities their fellow countrymen and governments committed here."" Schoolchildren and factory workers also came on visits. Near the monument, we find a run-down hall with dusty glass cases, peeling red posters on the walls and photographs of the ""martyrs who gave their lives for the Revolution"" or died here on the island, which is described in the inscriptions as a concentration camp. There are pictures of Gen Edmund Ironside, the British commander of all the Allied troops in the region. Novikova says he would have known what was happening on the island even if he never visited. This is confirmed by an entry in the leather-bound notebooks he kept in Russia, now in the possession of his 93-year-old son. ""Scurvy seems to be beginning among the Russian prisoners on Mudyug Islandâ¦ and as it is a difficult place to get to, rations have been pinched,"" the general writes. If the British established the camp and some of those in charge were French, many guards seem to have been local men. ""We cannot have a scandalous camp,"" he writes. ""I am responsible that the Russians treat their people well. I am always after them over the state of the prison."" But Novikova says improving conditions on Mudyug was hardly a priority for Ironside. ""For him it was just a necessary security measure, and after all people were fighting and dying every day on all the fronts. So if prisoners in the rear were dying from bad conditions, that was just a drop in the ocean of suffering here."" The treatment of prisoners on Mudyug horrified one man who would later play a devastating role in northern Russia. A prominent Bolshevik close to Lenin, Mikhail Kedrov, was sent to Arkhangelsk after the October revolution and later became became a fanatical regional head of the Cheka - the secret police. Alexander Orlov, a fellow Chekist who later defected to Canada, recalls Kedrov as a tall handsome man with ragged black hair.  He writes that his eyes were often ""gleaming like burning coalâ¦ possibly these were the sparks of madness"". Soviet citizens were encouraged to visit the Mudyug prison camp While the Red Terror was not mentioned in the USSR for decades, the crimes of the White forces were endlessly listed in official propaganda. Atrocities were committed on both sides, says historian Liudmila Novikova, but the scale was different. ""The Whites and Allies who supported them were mainly pragmatic. They wanted to kill those who undermined their effort, troops who rebelled or members of the Bolshevik underground - they didn't care about eliminating their enemies totally. It was quite different on Red side because they were waging a war against the old regime - the bourgeoisie, Tsarist officers and  whole classes were perceived as enemies who had to be liquidated,"" she says. Lucy Ash tells the story of the forgotten war fought by Western troops in Arctic Russia inThe Red and the White, on the BBC World Service Click here for transmission times, or to listen online Mikhail Kedrov set up a number of death camps in the North, including the first one of its kind, in Kholmogory, an hour's drive from Arkhangelsk. Somewhere between 3,000 and 8,000 people were imprisoned and killed at a 17th Century convent. Many were White Army officers and sailors from the Kronstadt naval fortress near Finland who had rebelled against the Bolsheviks. But others had nothing to do with the military. Some were clergy, some were ordinary people who for some reason had been labelled ""counter-revolutionaries"". At Kholmogory, where much of the convent is now held up by scaffolding and wrapped in corrugated iron, I met Elena, a parishioner who sings in the convent choir. She says people in the area sometimes find skulls when they dig pits to store potatoes over the winter. Elena says the priest and volunteers collected some human remains in sacks and buried them under a marble cross on one side of the Cathedral of the Transfiguration. Each year they sing a requiem for those who died. It's hard to pinpoint but there is an oppressive atmosphere which clings to this place, like the cold to the refectory walls when Elena invites us inside for a cup of tea. Locals use the path through the garden as a shortcut across the town but Elena says few know - or care - about Kholmogory's terrible history. Does she believe the Allied Intervention was the catalyst for Russia's devastating civil war, as Lenin and others have often claimed? ""I remember in my childhood hearing stories from my granny,"" she says. ""I was a Young Pioneer and I told her the Reds were good and the Whites were bad and the Intervention troops were bad. And my granny said 'What are you talking about? The English came to our village, they brought us white flour, they gave the children sweets.' And I said: 'Granny - that is impossible they are our enemies!'"" Elena shakes her head.  ""They were not our enemies and to say they were responsible for the civil war is wrong. Of course not! We had enough of our own scoundrels without the intervention troops."" The radical journalist, Pavel Rasskazov, who documented his ordeal on Mudyug island, describes a French-Russian officer and former businessman from Moscow, a man ""of medium height, stout, with a round, flabby face, like a bulldog"". Ernest Beaux was actually a perfumer who concocted scents for the tsar's family - such as the ""Bouquet de Napoleon"". But in 1918 he was working as a counter-intelligence officer on Mudyug, interrogating Bolsheviks captured by the White Russian and Allied armies. By the end of the year, Beaux had emigrated to France, where a cousin of Nicholas II introduced him to the couturier, Coco Chanel. He has gone down in history as the man who invented Chanel No5. According to some accounts he wanted to capture the essence of snow melting on black earth and asinspired by his time in the ""land of the midnight sun,external"" - the Russian Arctic.

"Ms Sobchak said her candidacy was motivated by her desire to be ""a mouthpiece for those who cannot be candidates"" Russian socialite Ksenia Sobchak is to stand in the country's presidential election in March, when Vladimir Putin is widely expected to run again. Ms Sobchak conceded she was an unlikely candidate and said she supported opposition leader Alexei Navalny, who is barred from standing. However he had warned her not to stand and some commentators now predict an opposition split. The Kremlin welcomed her candidacy, saying it was fully constitutional. Mr Navalny is currently serving a 20-day prison sentence for his role in organising ""unsanctioned"" protests. He is banned from the election due toa fraud conviction which he says was fabricated. by Sarah Rainsford, BBC News, Moscow This announcement was a long time rumoured, so Alexei Navalny made his views clear last month shortly before his latest arrest. The anti-corruption blogger dismissed Ksenia Sobchak as a Kremlin stooge, a ""liberal laughing stock"" and an opposition ""caricature"", brought in to lend legitimacy to a sham vote. He scorned her as a showbiz celebrity, only seeking more social media ""likes"" and followers. Ms Sobchak herself denies she is a spoiler, saying she will step down if Mr Navalny himself is allowed to run for president. That scenario looks highly improbable though. Mr Navalny has been seen as the biggest political threat to Mr Putin So the socialite-turned-journalist has promised to be a ""loudspeaker"" for those fed up with the lies, theft and corruption of their leaders. It is language that she borrows quite heavily from Mr Navalny. She would be the first woman candidate in 14 years, a point which her campaign video in a kitchen underscores. But Ms Sobchak also has the ""Marmite"" effect: she is as unpalatable to as many people as she attracts. And crucially, it's not clear how far she'd actually go in criticising Vladimir Putin himself, a close family friend since her childhood. Ms Sobchak, a journalist and TV presenter, called for the bar on him standing to be lifted. She said she wanted to be ""a mouthpiece for those who cannot be candidates"". ""I am against revolution but I am a good middleman and organiser,"" Ms Sobchak wrote in a letter published on the website of Vedomosti business daily. Russia's election campaign starts around 7 December, when political parties are expected to hold congresses to nominate their candidates. A Russian citizen not backed by a political party has the right to register as an independent presidential candidate provided he or she collects at least 300,000 signatures. President Putin, who first took office as president in 2000, has not announced yet whether he will stand again. Aged 35, she is the daughter of Anatoly Sobchak, the late mayor of St Petersburg and a man who in the 1990s employed then little-known former KGB agent Vladimir Putin Nicknamed ""Russia's Paris Hilton"", she won fame by presenting a popular dating reality show called Dom-2 Denigrated by some as a party girl, she also gained attention for once presenting another reality TV show from a bubble bath She raised eyebrows by joining opposition protests in 2012 against Mr Putin Protests across Russia on Putin birthday Russian opposition leader jailed again Navalny barred from Russian election At least two killed and 1,000 structures destroyed as wildfires rage in Los Angeles In maps: Thousands of acres on fire in LA 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Why does Trump want Greenland and what do its people think?

"This video can not be played Sir Tom said: ""What's tried on women is tried on men as well"" Sir Tom Jones has said the abuse and harassment alleged to have taken place in Hollywood is also widespread in the music industry. The singer was discussing theallegations surrounding Harvey Weinsteinin an interview with the BBC. ""Things have always happened in the music industry as well,"" he said. ""There's been people complaining about publicists and different things they've been expected to do to get a record contract, just like a film contract."" Asked on BBC Radio 5 live's Afternoon Edition whether it was something he'd experienced, Sir Tom replied: ""Yes. At the beginning, yes. ""There were a few things like that. But you avoid it. You just walk out... But what's tried on women is tried on men as well."" Sir Tom said the encounter early in his career made him feel ""terrible"". ""But then you think, 'Well, I've got to get away from this person and it can't be like this.' ""You should know that yourself, you don't do things just because you think, 'I should do this.' Your own mind will tell you that. Not just in showbusiness, but in any thing you're in."" He added: ""There's always been that element there that people with power sometimes abuse it, but they don't all abuse it, there are good people."" Sir Tom is currently a coach on ITV's The Voice Asked further about his own experience, he said: ""It wasn't bad, just somebody tried to pull... it was a question and I said 'No thank you.'"" The singer was asked about the number of allegations against major figures in the film industry that have come out in recent days. He replied: ""Things happen in showbusiness, and sometimes things are covered up and then they come to light and other people come forward - it's like taking the cork off of a bottle. ""Things come out that maybe should've come out years ago, who knows. But that's the way it is with showbusiness, you are in the public eye, and that's it, you have to take the good with the bad.

"Tough choices: How will Carles Puigdemont (L) answer Mariano Rajoy's ultimatum? A final deadline for Catalonia to drop a secession bid has passed, with Spain warning it will suspend the region's autonomy. Catalonia's leader Carles Puigdemont was given until 10:00 local time (08:00 GMT) to clarify his position. After a referendum on 1 October, he signed an independence declaration but then suspended it, asking for dialogue. Reports suggest he will press ahead on independence if Madrid moves to take direct control. There are fears that this may lead to civil unrest in Catalonia. Article 155 of Spain's 1978 constitution, which cemented democratic rule after the death of dictator General Franco three years earlier, allows Madrid to impose direct rule in a crisis but it has never been invoked. In the lead-up to the deadline, there have beenmass protests over the detentionof two leaders of the separatist movement. Catalan views: Unionists v separatists Catalan crisis in 300 words Reality Check: Would Catalonia be a viable country? Political leaders in Madrid and Barcelona have been engaged in a tense stand-off since the disputed referendum, which Catalan leaders say resulted in a ""Yes"" vote for independence but which the central government regards as illegal. Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy set the deadline for Mr Puigdemont to offer a definitive answer on the independence question, and called on him to ""act sensibly"". This video can not be played Why is there a Catalan crisis? The answer is in its past, as Europe correspondent Gavin Lee explains ""It's not that difficult to reply to the question: has Catalonia declared independence? Because if it has, the government is obliged to act in one way, and if it has not, we can talk here,"" he said in parliament on Wednesday. The man who wants to break up Spain This was the second and final deadline, as Madrid says Mr Puigdemont on Monday failed to clarify whether he had declared independence. If Mr Rajoy decides that his government should intervene, he is expected to call a special cabinet meeting to discuss what specific measures should be taken. He is due to attend an EU summit in Brussels on Thursday afternoon. It is possible a cabinet meeting could be called before he goes or postponed until Friday. The government will then be expected to draw up a list of specific measures under Article 155 of the constitution, launching the transfer of powers from Catalonia to Madrid. The article says:""If a self-governing community does not fulfil the obligations imposed upon it by the constitution or other laws, or acts in a way that is seriously prejudicial to the general interest of Spain, the government... may... take all measures necessary to compel the community to meet said obligations, or to protect the above-mentioned general interest."" This video can not be played Protesters held candles and chanted as they marched through Barcelona It is thought the measures taken could range from taking control of the regional police and finances to calling a snap election. Spain's Senate, controlled by Mr Rajoy's conservative Popular Party (PP) and its allies, would then have to approve the list. The timetable for this process is imprecise. Analysts say Article 155 does not give the government the power to fully suspend autonomy, and it will not be able to deviate from the list of measures. For Madrid this is about upholding the rule of law in Catalonia, protecting the Spanish constitution and disciplining what it sees as an unruly, disobedient devolved government, the BBC's Tom Burridge in Barcelona reports. However, the central government wants to minimise the risk of large-scale demonstrations, our correspondent says. Civil servants and government lawyers have thought long and hard about what measures to adopt and when and how they should be implemented. Reports in Spanish and Catalan media suggest Mr Puigdemont will move ahead with the independence bid if Madrid rejects his call for dialogue and suspends the autonomy of the wealthy north-eastern region. Banner reading 'Dialogue, Respect, Sport' during a football match in Barcelona He is under pressure from influential factions within the secessionist movement to lift the suspension of the independence declaration. On Wednesday, Barcelona football fans called for political negotiations, unveiling a huge banner reading ""Dialogue, Respect, Sport"" during a Champions League match against Olympiakos from Greece. Mr Puigdemont appears to have one more option. If he calls elections in the region himself, Madrid would not invoke Article 155, government sources say. This would allow Catalans to decide on their future in a way that was acceptable to the central government, unlike the referendum, analysts say. But the foreign affairs chief for Catalonia's regional government, Raul Romeva, said on Wednesday: ""Elections are not on the table now."" As well as the ruling PP, Mr Rajoy has the support of the centre-left Socialists and centrist Cuidadanos (Citizens) on the Catalan crisis. Between them they control at least 254 out of 350 seats in the lower house - the Congress of Deputies - and at least 214 out of 266 seats in the Senate. This video can not be played Catalonia independence and some of Europe's border changes However, there have been sharp exchanges in recent days, with the head of one left-wing Catalan party accusing the government of choosing humiliation, repression and fear over dialogue. The radical left-wing Podemos party and other regional leftist groups are also opposed to the government position, and have protested against the detention of Catalan activists.

"The pressures of school life can be tough for a lot of kids, but for a child who's experienced abuse, neglect and years in care, the strain can be even greater. When Evelyn and Tony adopted Ryan at the age of seven, his special educational needs were not immediately apparent. Ryan is smart, bright and eager to please - every teacher's dream. But the trauma of his early years meant the day-to-day expectations of mainstream school were too much for him. Evelyn:Ryan came to us with a history of abuse and neglect - domestic violence, drugs and alcohol, not getting enough food, inadequate clothing, extremely poor hygiene - but nothing actually diagnosed as being any particular special need. He used to hide a lot when we first had him, so if you even very slightly raised your voice, or there was even a slight sign of disapproval - the slightest - he would hide behind a curtain or under the bed and shake and ask you if you were going to hit him. He'd been in multiple schools before he came to us and when he came to us we were advised that he only went in for a couple of hours per day for the first few weeks. I think he did very well with that. He integrated in the beginning very well because the pressure isn't so much in Year 2 and in Year 3. He coped quite well then. Tony:It was more Year 5 and 6. That's when it really started to hit. He found it more of a struggle, the work was harder and he couldn't cope with it. When he was in Year 6 we stopped all homework because when we tried to do homework with him he couldn't cope with it. He threatened to self-harm and to harm us, as well. Evelyn:Especially then with Sats tests in Year 6. The anxiety got worse and worse. His sleep became much worse, he became much more anxious. He started not being able to go in in the morning, feeling really sick. There were days when we couldn't get him in to school. It was dreadfully stressful. Tony:Plus he wouldn't sleep very well, so we were trying to help him to sleep. We were often up 'til one or two in the morning. Both ends of the day were a problem. Evelyn:We repeatedly asked the primary school to have an educational psychologist come in and make an assessment and we were constantly told: ""No, there's not enough need. He's intelligent"". So we got absolutely nowhere. The subsequent move to a comprehensive school proved highly stressful for Ryan and, after a term and a half, he dropped out. Evelyn:The Senco (special educational needs co-ordinator) seemed not to have much experience around trauma and attachment issues. When he met Ryan on the first day, we felt as if he was suggesting that we were lying, because he didn't outwardly appear to be anxious and he was very good at trying to fit in and looked good, looked smart and didn't look like a child with special needs. Unfortunately because they didn't adequately understand him - because it is mainstream education - they couldn't provide for his needs. Tony:Things slowly got worse and worse and he started school-refusing. We tried all sorts of things to help him and talked to the teachers. 'Quarter of adoptive families' in crisis 'We're scared of our adopted son' That worked for a little bit, but eventually he just couldn't cope. He couldn't cope with the large classrooms, he couldn't cope with certain teachers, any teacher that shouted, and eventually he just hid in a cupboard for a couple of days and wouldn't come out. We just couldn't get him to school. Evelyn:And when he wasn't in school anymore, he became quite agoraphobic, he became very isolated and his mental health was even worse because he wasn't in any form of education. Desperate for help, Evelyn and Tony turned to the adoption agency Family Futures and to a specialist children's hospital. These organisations assessed Ryan and reported that he did have specific needs. Evelyn:The Family Futures report came out telling us that Ryan had developmental trauma, sensory modulation difficulty, generalised anxiety disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder. We also went to the attachment and trauma team at the children's hospital and they did assessments, as well. So between the two places, that was the diagnosis and this gave us all the evidence we needed for getting our EHCP [education, health and care plan], which we triggered ourselves. Tony:Luckily we got that EHCP and that helped us secure Ryan's education - to go to a special needs school. Evelyn:But none of the schools in our local authority [area] met his needs. We were then advised that we'd have to look beyond our own borough to try and find something. So we searched the internet and we found a local therapeutic provision for education. He was offered a place and started this September. His new school is much smaller, with much smaller classes. It's individually tailored to each child's needs and there's much more encouragement. It's about building him up, meeting his needs - it's not about getting him nine GCSEs; it's about trying to help him survive. For two weeks he went part-time. He's full-time now and he loves it. In fact, tonight he said to me: ""Thank you for fighting for me. If I ever win the Oscars, I'll get you on stage to celebrate with me."" In spite of their battles, Evelyn and Tony have no regrets, but wish the authorities were more honest with, and supportive of, adoptive families. Evelyn:We've had a lot of people in education look at Ryan and say: ""But there's nothing wrong with him, he looks completely normal."" And I think that, as adopters, when we adopted him, we thought exactly the same. I don't think that we had any idea that he had this level of special need and when you finally get these diagnoses, in some ways it's quite shocking. It's quite a relief but it's also a shock because you do feel they did know or they could have really guessed that there would be some degree of need in this way - but they don't tell you and it would really help if you did know. Tony:It would be much better if the authorities were able to give a lot more help, because without so much of a battle it would be great. Sometimes it is just really hard work and it seems like you're constantly having a wall to climb each time to get help, which there really shouldn't be. We don't have any regrets at all. To anyone who's thinking about adopting I'd say you've got to go in with your eyes open, getting as much information as you can and realising that lots of the children that get adopted will have special needs in some way, or need extra help in their life, and that's a battle sometimes - but it's worth it. All names have been changed.

Reports suggest he will press ahead on independence if Madrid moves to take direct control. There are fears that this may lead to civil unrest in Catalonia. Article 155 of Spain's 1978 constitution, which cemented democratic rule after the death of dictator General Franco three years earlier, allows Madrid to impose direct rule in a crisis but it has never been invoked. In the lead-up to the deadline, there have beenmass protests over the detentionof two leaders of the separatist movement. Catalan views: Unionists v separatists Catalan crisis in 300 words Reality Check: Would Catalonia be a viable country? Political leaders in Madrid and Barcelona have been engaged in a tense stand-off since the disputed referendum, which Catalan leaders say resulted in a ""Yes"" vote for independence but which the central government regards as illegal. Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy set the deadline for Mr Puigdemont to offer a definitive answer on the independence question, and called on him to ""act sensibly"". This video can not be played Why is there a Catalan crisis? The answer is in its past, as Europe correspondent Gavin Lee explains ""It's not that difficult to reply to the question: has Catalonia declared independence? Because if it has, the government is obliged to act in one way, and if it has not, we can talk here,"" he said in parliament on Wednesday. The man who wants to break up Spain This was the second and final deadline, as Madrid says Mr Puigdemont on Monday failed to clarify whether he had declared independence. If Mr Rajoy decides that his government should intervene, he is expected to call a special cabinet meeting to discuss what specific measures should be taken. He is due to attend an EU summit in Brussels on Thursday afternoon. It is possible a cabinet meeting could be called before he goes or postponed until Friday. The government will then be expected to draw up a list of specific measures under Article 155 of the constitution, launching the transfer of powers from Catalonia to Madrid. The article says:""If a self-governing community does not fulfil the obligations imposed upon it by the constitution or other laws, or acts in a way that is seriously prejudicial to the general interest of Spain, the government... may... take all measures necessary to compel the community to meet said obligations, or to protect the above-mentioned general interest."" This video can not be played Protesters held candles and chanted as they marched through Barcelona It is thought the measures taken could range from taking control of the regional police and finances to calling a snap election. Spain's Senate, controlled by Mr Rajoy's conservative Popular Party (PP) and its allies, would then have to approve the list. The timetable for this process is imprecise. Analysts say Article 155 does not give the government the power to fully suspend autonomy, and it will not be able to deviate from the list of measures. For Madrid this is about upholding the rule of law in Catalonia, protecting the Spanish constitution and disciplining what it sees as an unruly, disobedient devolved government, the BBC's Tom Burridge in Barcelona reports. However, the central government wants to minimise the risk of large-scale demonstrations, our correspondent says. Civil servants and government lawyers have thought long and hard about what measures to adopt and when and how they should be implemented. Reports in Spanish and Catalan media suggest Mr Puigdemont will move ahead with the independence bid if Madrid rejects his call for dialogue and suspends the autonomy of the wealthy north-eastern region. Banner reading 'Dialogue, Respect, Sport' during a football match in Barcelona He is under pressure from influential factions within the secessionist movement to lift the suspension of the independence declaration. On Wednesday, Barcelona football fans called for political negotiations, unveiling a huge banner reading ""Dialogue, Respect, Sport"" during a Champions League match against Olympiakos from Greece. Mr Puigdemont appears to have one more option. If he calls elections in the region himself, Madrid would not invoke Article 155, government sources say. This would allow Catalans to decide on their future in a way that was acceptable to the central government, unlike the referendum, analysts say. But the foreign affairs chief for Catalonia's regional government, Raul Romeva, said on Wednesday: ""Elections are not on the table now."" As well as the ruling PP, Mr Rajoy has the support of the centre-left Socialists and centrist Cuidadanos (Citizens) on the Catalan crisis. Between them they control at least 254 out of 350 seats in the lower house - the Congress of Deputies - and at least 214 out of 266 seats in the Senate. This video can not be played Catalonia independence and some of Europe's border changes However, there have been sharp exchanges in recent days, with the head of one left-wing Catalan party accusing the government of choosing humiliation, repression and fear over dialogue. The radical left-wing Podemos party and other regional leftist groups are also opposed to the government position, and have protested against the detention of Catalan activists.

"In Britain, a lot of low paid workers are permanently stuck in poorly paid jobs A quarter of low paid workers are permanently stuck in poorly paid jobs in the UK with little chance of earning more, according to new research. The Social Mobility Commission said low pay was ""endemic"" in the UK, with women more likely to get stuck on low pay. It found just one in six low paid workers had managed to escape from poorly paid jobs in the last decade. The report defines low pay as hourly earnings below two-thirds of the median hourly wage, which was Â£8.10 last year. The median hourly wage for an average person across the entire British workforce was Â£12.10 per hour in 2016, according to the report. ""This lack of pay progress can have a huge scarring effect on people's lifetime living standards,"" Conor Darcy, a senior policy analyst with think tank Resolution Foundation, which carried out the research, said. He called for ""a more comprehensive response from business and government"" to help people earn more. Think tank IPPR said wealth inequality was growing in the UK On average, people stuck on low pay have seen their hourly wages rise by just 40p in real terms over the last decade, compared to a Â£4.83 pay rise for those who have permanently ""escaped"", said the report. The report found that low pay was a particular issue for women in their early 20s and said a lack of ""good quality, flexible work"" for those with child caring responsibilities was to blame. The industries with the lowest paid jobs are retail and hospitality, the report said. Although some employers in the hospitality and retail industries try to keep overheads down with low-paid jobs, Mr Darcy said this solution would not work in the long term, asemployment costs are likely to go up. A Business Department spokesman said it had made progress on low pay: ""We have more people in work than ever before, taken 1.3 million people out of income tax altogether since 2015 and the national living wage has delivered the fastest pay rise for the lowest earners in 20 years."" A separate report from think tank IPPR said inequality was growing in the UK with young people particularly affected. It said the richest 10% of British households had an average of Â£1.32m in net property, pension and financial wealth. In contrast, the average wealth of the bottom 50% of households was Â£3,200, it said.

"Santiago Maldonado has been missing since 1 August Major political parties in Argentina have suspended election campaigning after the discovery of a body thought to be that of a missing activist. Santiago Maldonado, 28, was last seen in August during a confrontation between police and indigenous rights activists at a protest in Patagonia. Mr Maldonado's disappearance caused a national outcry and has since become highly politicised. The news comes ahead of Argentina's congressional elections on Sunday. Both governing and opposition parties have suspended campaigning as the body is transported to Buenos Aires for identification. Forensic experts have been assigned and a post-mortem will take place at the request of the Maldonado family. Prosecutor Silvia Avila said the body, discovered in a riverbed just a few hundred metres from where Mr Maldonado was last seen, was found with clothing that resembled those belonging to the missing activist, AFP news agency reports. Argentine activist's mystery disappearance Thousands march for Maldonado In a statement, the Maldonado family said that the true identity of the body and cause of death would not be known until ""experts have completed their work"". They added: ""We are asking that our privacy be respected at this difficult time."" Witnesses say Mr Maldonado was last seen after he was arrested at a demonstration for the rights of the Mapuche indigenous group in southern Argentina on 1 August. On the day that he disappeared, border police clashed with protesters while dismantling a roadblock that had been erected on Route 40, the main road crossing Argentina from north to south. Police later denied detaining Mr Maldonado. Human rights campaigners, union leaders and left-wing groups had called on the government of Mauricio Macri, which has denied allegations of a cover-up, to do more to find him. President Macri's government then offered a reward of almost $30,000 (Â£23,000) for information on his disappearance. Meanwhile Mr Maldonado's brother, Sergio, has called for an independent investigation outside police authority. In September, thousands of Argentines marched in the capital Buenos Aires to protest the activist's disappearance. The rally was one of many protests in cities across Argentina.
