"The Greatest Showman, starring Hugh Jackman, has been a hit in both the film and music charts The Greatest Showman soundtrack is number one in the UK for the 11th week in a row - more than any other album in modern chart history except Adele's 21. The soundtrack hasn't loosened its grip on the top spot since January, and has seen off competition from the likes of Craig David and Camila Cabello. It has sold 465,000 copies - more than 40% of which have been on CD and vinyl, the Official Charts Company said. The success comes despite lukewarm reviews for the movie itself. The Telegraph declared it ""completely and utterly bibbly bibbly quack-quack insane"", while the Evening Standard called it ""a load of big top baloney"". But the film, which stars Hugh Jackman as circus entrepreneur PT Barnum, defied the critics to become a major box office success. In the UK, it has sold Â£37.5m worth of tickets, second only to Black Panther in 2018. Many fans are paying to see the film multiple times, with a knock-on effect on the success of the soundtrack, which has also spawned the top 40 hits This Is Me and Rewrite The Stars. When it first reached number one, on its third week of release, songwriters Benj Pasek and Justin Paul said they were ""honoured and thrilled"" by its reception in the UK. How The Greatest Showman became a film phenomenon ""The universal themes of inclusion and acceptance are what inspired every song on the soundtrack, and we couldn't be more proud of everyone involved,"" they told the Official Charts Company. The album, released by Atlantic Records, now has the the joint-longest consecutive run at the top spot in the past 30 years, along with Adele's 21 in 2011. Adele's album 21 was knocked off the top spot after 11 weeks Other albums that have enjoyed long consecutive spells at the summit include Madonna's Immaculate Collection (nine weeks in 1990), the Eurythmics' Greatest Hits (nine weeks in 1991), The Beatles' greatest hits collection 1 (nine weeks in 2000), and Ed Sheeran's Divide (nine weeks in 2017). The overall record for the longest ever spell at number one is held by the South Pacific soundtrack, which was number one for a mammoth 70 weeks in a row from 1958-1960. Meanwhile, on this week's singles chart, Drake also sustains a long run at the summit - with God's Plan notching up its ninth week in pole position. That means Rudimental's These Days has to settle for a seventh week at number two. It is now one of only three singles to spend so long in second place without reaching number one. The others are I Swear by All-4-One in 1994, and Moves Like Jagger by Maroon 5 and Christina Aguilera in 2011. Elsewhere in this week's top five, George Ezra's Paradise climbs seven places to number five, earning his third top 10 hit. The star's second album, Staying At Tamara's, will be The Greatest Showman's biggest competition in the albums chart next week.

"Jeremy Corbyn has expressed ""sincere regret"" at failing to look more closely at an allegedly anti-Semitic mural in London before questioning its removal. The Labour leader has been criticised for responding to a Facebook post by street artist, Mear One, in 2012, which asked why the image faced destruction. Mr Corbyn had written: ""Why? You are in good company"" - but has now said the image was ""deeply disturbing"". The mural, ""Freedom of Humanity"", was removed from East London in 2012. ""I wholeheartedly support its removal,"" Mr Corbyn said. Labour MP Luciana Berger - who highlighted the post on Twitter - called Mr Corbyn's response ""wholly inadequate"". She said: ""It fails to understand on any level the hurt and anguish felt about anti-Semitism. I will be raising this further."" Allow Twitter content?

In the post from October 2012, the Labour leader appeared to oppose the mural's removal - by comparing it to Diego Rivera's ""Man at the Crossroads"", which the US Rockefeller family covered over because it featured a picture of Lenin. In a statement, Mr Corbyn said he had intended to make a ""general comment"" about the removal of public art on the grounds of freedom of speech. He added: ""I sincerely regret that I did not look more closely at the image I was commenting on, the contents of which are deeply disturbing and anti-Semitic. ""I am opposed to the production of anti-Semitic material of any kind, and the defence of free speech cannot be used as a justification for the promotion of anti-Semitism in any form."" Mear One - whose real name is Kalen Ockerman - has denied being anti-Semitic, saying the mural was about ""class and privilege"".

Gary Aitkenhead said suggestions by Russia that the proximity of the labs to the incident in Salisbury might be somehow suspicious were ""frustrating"" . He said the laboratory had the ""highest levels"" of controls and security. Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia remain in a critical condition.

It says anyone in either venue between 13:30 GMT on Sunday 4 March and closure on Monday should arrange to have their clothes collected by the council and they will be compensated. PHE's earlier advice had been to wash possessions as a precaution and double bag in plastic clothes that needed dry cleaning until further notice.

Sergei Skripal, 66, and his daughter Yulia, 33, are in a critical condition in hospital Mrs May had told MPs that scientists at Porton Down had identified the substance used in the attack as belonging to a group of military-grade nerve agents known as Novichok, developed by Russia.

"Lt-Col Beltrame took the place of a woman being used as a human shield by gunman Redouane Lakdim A police officer who swapped himself for a hostage in a supermarket siege is fighting for his life in hospital, French President Emmanuel Macron says. The gendarme, whom media named as Lt-Col Arnaud Beltrame, helped bring an end to a gunman's shooting spree that killed three in southern France. The gunman - 25-year-old Redouane Lakdim - said he had been acting on behalf of the Islamic State group. He was shot dead by French police after mounting three separate attacks. Sixteen people were injured, two seriously, in what Mr Macron called an act of ""Islamist terrorism"". Lakdim is said to have been demanding the release of Salah Abdeslam, the most important surviving suspect in the 13 November 2015 attacks in Paris, which killed 130 people. One person - believed to be Lakdim's partner - has been arrested in connection with the shootings. Five things about Paris attacks suspect Salah Abdeslam The violence began on Friday morning in Carcassonne, where Lakdim hijacked a car, killing one passenger - whose body was later found hidden in a bush - and injuring the driver. He then shot and wounded a policeman who was jogging with colleagues. This video can not be played Eye-witness says French hostage-taker ran after him Lakdim is then believed to have driven a few kilometres to the small town of TrÃ¨bes, where he charged into the Super-U supermarket, shouting, ""I am a soldier of Daesh [Islamic State]!"" He killed two people - a customer and store employee - before seizing others as hostages. Carole, who was shopping at the supermarket, said people hid in a cold room. ""A man shouted and fired several times,"" she told France info radio. ""I saw a cold room door, I asked people to come and take shelter."" ""There were 10 of us, and we stayed an hour. There were more gunshots and we went out the emergency back door."" Interior Minister GÃ©rard Collomb told reporters that police officers had managed to get some people out but the gunman had held one woman back as a human shield. It was at this point, he said, that the 45-year-old gendarme officer had volunteered to swap himself for her, leaving his mobile phone on a table with an open line so police could monitor the situation. When police heard gunshots, a tactical team stormed the supermarket. The gunman was killed but Arnaud Beltrame was seriously injured. Mr Collomb hailed the ""heroism and courage"" of Lt-Col Beltrame. President Macron said he had ""saved lives and honoured his colleagues and his country"". This video can not be played ""This was a heroic act"" on the part of the lieutenant-colonel, says Interior Minister GÃ©rard Collomb A Portuguese national said to have been killed was in fact seriously injured, a government official in Lisbon said later, according to AFP news agency. Redouane Lakdim, who was born in April 1992 in Morocco and had French nationality, was known to French intelligence services. Prosecutor Francois Molins said he had been on an extremist watch-list due to ""his radicalisation and his links with the Salafist movement"", a hardline offshoot of Sunni Islam. But subsequent investigations by intelligence services had not turned up any signs he would act, he said. Lakdim was found guilty of carrying a prohibited weapon in 2011 and convicted for drug use and refusing a court order in 2015, Mr Molins said. Earlier, Mr Collomb said that though he had been known to authorities as a petty criminal.  they ""did not think he had been radicalised"". Lakdim lived in an apartment in Carcassonne with his parents and several sisters. A neighbour saw him taking one of his sisters to school on Friday morning. The family's apartment was raided by police on Friday afternoon. In a statement released online, Islamic State militants claimed the attacker was ""a soldier of the Islamic State"" - a claim President Macron said the security services were studying. French President Emmanuel Macron was informed about the hostage crisis while giving a news conference at an EU summit in Brussels France has been hit by several deadly jihadist attacks since 2015 and has been on high alert since, though a state of emergency was lifted last year. In February, Salah Abdeslam went on trial in Belgium over a shootout in Brussels that led to his capture months after the Paris attacks. He is not expected to go on trial in France until 2020 at the earliest. 1 Oct 2017 -Two women stabbed to death at Marseille railway station; attack claimed by IS 26 Jul 2016 -Two attackers slit priest's throat at his church in Normandy; shot dead by police 14 Jul 2016 -Huge lorry mows down crowd on Nice beachfront, killing 86.

"A teenager has been described as ""dangerous and devious"" by a judge as he was jailed for life for planting a bomb on a Tube train at Parsons Green. Ahmed Hassan's device partially exploded in September, injuring 51. The 18-year-old, found guilty of attempted murder, was ordered to serve a minimum of 34 years. Police said Hassan, from Surrey, appeared to be co-operating with government deradicalisation programme Prevent at the time of the attack. But the BBC has been told the Iraqi asylum seeker had not agreed to take part in the Prevent scheme, which operates on the basis that people regarded ""at risk"" give their consent. The Iraqi fantasist who wanted attention Why is it so easy to buy bomb-making ingredients? In victim impact statements read out in court, commuters said they believed they were going to die and described how they had been troubled by disturbing recollections and fears. Passing sentence, the judge, Mr Justice Haddon-Cave, said he would be treating the incident as a terrorist offence. In a January 2016 immigration interview, Hassan told officials he had been in contact with the Islamic State group and had been ""trained to kill"". The trial also heard he blamed the UK for the death of his father in Iraq. The judge told Hassan: ""There is no doubt that you are a very dangerous and devious individual. ""You quietly went about planning and executing this terrorist bomb attack with ruthless determination and almost military efficiency, whilst pretending to be a model asylum-seeker."" He added: ""I am satisfied you were determined to create as much death and carnage that day as possible."" This video can not be played CCTV of Parson's Green Tube bomb fireball Police have said Hassan appeared to be co-operating with its Channel programme, part of the Prevent deradicalisation scheme, at the time of the attack. But the BBC understands Hassan had not agreed to take part - despite consent being a fundamental principle of the programme. In a statement, Surrey County Council said that staff from the local Channel panel met Hassan on many occasions between February 2016 and September 2017. The council said Hassan had received ""extensive support"" including from mental health and educational experts, which the Channel panel monitored and reviewed. Surrey acknowledged Hassan did not have a specialist mentor from the programme working with him. It refused to respond when asked if Hassan had consented to be on the Channel programme. Hassan's bomb partially exploded at 08:20 GMT after the train arrived at Parsons Green station, leaving 23 people with burn injuries and 28 suffering crush injuries as they fled from the train and station. Prosecutors at the sentencing hearing said there would have been ""serious harm, if not fatality"" if the bomb - packed with 2kg of screwdrivers, knives, nuts and bolts - had fully detonated. Hassan left his bomb in the carriage and left the train Hassan had built the bomb in the home of his foster parents in Sunbury-on-Thames while they were away. On the morning of 15 September, he took a westbound District Line train from Wimbledon, getting off one stop before Parsons Green. His device, which had a timer and was placed in a supermarket plastic bag, was left on the floor of the carriage. He was arrested the following morning at Dover. Hassan arrived in the UK in a lorry after having spent time in the migrant camp in Calais known as the Jungle and he was referred to Surrey County Council's social services - a standard procedure for unaccompanied child asylum seekers. Hassan's foster parents were not aware of the concerns that he harboured extremist views. Following the verdict, Surrey County Council apologised, saying its work ""wasn't as good as it should have been"" in helping to stop individuals from being drawn to terrorism. In a victim impact statement read by prosecutor Alison Morgan, Stephen Nash said he had to give up his job as a social worker because he feared getting on the Tube since the incident and does not like being amongst crowds. Ann Stuart said she became ""tearful for no discernible reason"" and had frightening dreams, adding: ""Since this happened I wake most mornings shaking and anxious"". Another victim, identified only as Miss S who suffering 16% burns to her body after the fire from the device melted her tights, had to see a psychologist.

"Two lorries and a minibus were involved in the crash on the M1 near Newport Pagnell in August Two lorry drivers have been jailed over a crash on the M1 in Buckinghamshire that killed eight people last year. Ryszard Masierak, 31, was jailed for 14 years after being found guilty of causing death by dangerous driving. David Wagstaff, 54, was sentenced to 40 months in prison after pleading guilty to causing death by careless driving. Eight people died when the minibus they were travelling in was hit by Wagstaff and shunted into Masierak's lorry, which had stopped on the inside lane. Judge Francis Sheridan said the crash was the most serious in the UK for more than 26 years. Sentencing the pair at Aylesbury Crown Court, Judge Sheridan described Masierak as a ""persistent, unmitigated, if not very accomplished liar"" who had shown ""no remorse"". ""What you have tried to do is blame everyone and everybody except yourself,"" he told him. Thetrial heard Masierak, of Barnards Close, Evesham, Worcestershire, was twice the drink-drive limitand had stopped on the inside lane near Newport Pagnell for 12 minutes before the crash on 26 August. The AIM Logistics driver admitted he had consumed alcohol but said he stopped because he was sweating, felt weak and had a headache. Ryszard Masierak and David Wagstaff were sentenced at Aylesbury Crown Court After the verdicts, it was revealed Masierak's professional driving licence had been revoked prior to the crash. At today's sentencing, the Polish national was told he could face deportation on his release from prison. Minibus driver Cyriac Joseph was waiting with his hazard lights on to go around Masierak's lorry when Fed Ex driver Wagstaff ploughed into the back of the van forcing it into and under Masierak's vehicle. Wagstaff, of Derwent Street, Stoke-on-Trent, had been on a hands-free call for an hour at the time of impact and the trial heard he did not brake before crashing into the minibus at 56mph. 'There is no life for me now' - minibus driver's wife M1 death crash trucker cleared of charge Lorry driver guilty over fatal M1 crash Judge Sheridan said Wagstaff had between nine and 11 seconds to see the vehicles ahead had he ""not been so distracted by using the phone"". ""You took no action whatsoever because you weren't concentrating on what was in front of you - they were there to be seen and you didn't see them."" A jury had cleared Wagstaff of causing death by dangerous driving. Despite Judge Sheridan acknowledging that Wagstaff had not broken the law by using a bluetooth headset, he said: ""It would be wrong of me not to take the opportunity to urge the public to download the app that deactivates your phone when you are on the move."" The minibus was owned and being driven by Cyriac Joseph The eight people killed were all travelling in the minibus, which was carrying 11 Indian tourists from Nottingham to London ahead of a trip to Disneyland Paris. The six men and two women who died were driver Cyriac Joseph, Panneerselvam Annamalai, Rishi Ranjeev Kumar, Vivek Baskaran, Lavanyalakshmi Seetharaman, Karthikeyan Pugalur Ramasubramanian, Subramaniyan Arachelvan and Tamilmani Arachelvan. Four other passengers - including a four-year-old girl orphaned by the crash - were seriously injured and spent weeks in hospital afterwards. Masierak was also disqualified from driving for 17 years after he was convicted of eight counts of causing death by dangerous driving and four counts of causing serious injury by dangerous driving. Wagstaff admitted eight counts of causing death by careless driving and four counts of causing serious injury by careless driving. He was banned from driving for three years. At the sentencing, Judge Sheridan took the opportunity to thank the victims' families who he said had ""conducted themselves with utmost dignity which was utterly humbling"".

"Michel Castellucci (pictured right), had an active social media presence until reports about the Snapchat posts were published An EasyJet captain and his co-pilot have been suspended amid reports they filmed Snapchat videos during a flight. The captain,named by The Sun as Michel Castellucci,external, uploaded clips of his colleague interacting with animated characters generated by the messaging app. Footage appears to show the pair inside a cockpit next to a computer-generated woman and a dancing owl. Passenger safety was not compromised at any point, the airline said. The BBC has not been able to reach Mr Castellucci for comment, who appears to have deleted his social media accounts since reports about the Snapchat posts emerged. According to the paper, he filmed the videos ""at 30,000ft"" during a flight from Paris to Madrid. It said it had been contacted by passengers who had branded the stunt ""dangerous"" and ""irresponsible"". A spokeswoman for Luton-based EasyJet said it happened when the aircraft was not carrying out any manoeuvre and the flight operated safely. She said: ""Whilst at no point was the safety of the passengers compromised, this falls well short of the high standards EasyJet expects of its pilots. ""It is not acceptable and is not representative of the thousands of highly professional pilots who work for the airline.

"This video can not be played Darren McKie tried to use his police knowledge to cover his tracks A police inspector has been found guilty of murdering his wife and dumping her body in a lake. Darren McKie, 43, denied murdering his wife Leanne but admitted manslaughter towards the end of his trial. Mrs McKie, 39, a detective constable, was found strangled in Poynton Lake in Cheshire on 29 September. Jurors at Chester Crown Court deliberated for almost two days before reaching a majority verdict. McKie will be sentenced on Tuesday. The couple, who both worked for Greater Manchester Police (GMP), had financial problems and owed more than Â£100,000, the court heard. They had appeared to be a ""perfect family"" but were really living ""well beyond their means"", prosecutors said. The father-of-three, who had 20 years of police service, strangled his wife after she discovered he had made a joint application for a Â£54,000 loan without her consent. Leanne and Darren McKie both worked for Greater Manchester Police McKie had forged his wife's signature repeatedly, using her warrant number and wage documents for the application, the jury heard. Prosecutor Nigel Power QC told the court: ""What produced the argument that led to her death was that he'd been found out in committing serious criminal offences."" The court heard McKie had left work at Stretford police station abruptly at about 11:30 GMT on the day of his wife's death, after receiving a text message from her revealing she had discovered the loan application. Mr Power said McKie then ""determinedly strangled his wife to death"", involving significant force for at least a minute. Leanne McKie's body was found in shallow water in Poynton Lake In the hours that followed, the inspector showed a surveyor into his home and was said to havelaughed with parents on the school run. Police believe Mrs McKie's body was either under the stairs or in the boot of their car when the surveyor arrived. He was twice spotted walking towards Wilmslow, where the family lived, by patrol officers in the hours before Mrs McKie's body was discovered in shallow water at Poynton Lake. During the second sighting, at 02:15 GMT, the officers noticed he was not wearing shoes. His trainers were later found in a wheelie bin with traces of his wife's blood on them, as well as soil from the lake area. In his closing speech, Mr Power said the inspector went on to play a ""game of cat and mouse"" with police. Darren McKie, pictured arriving at Chester Crown Court during his trial Mckie tried to cover his tracks by not carrying his mobile phone in an attempt to prevent police tracing his movements. He also sent text messages to his wife's phone in the hours after her death, and showed ""no emotion"" in police custody. The jury rejected McKie's defence barrister's suggestion that the killing had not been intentional andwas a ""terrible, terrible mistake"". Det Supt Aaron Duggan, who led the investigation, said: ""This is a very tragic case, we have got three children here who have been left without a mother - and sadly also a father - because of his actions. ""I think he has completely distanced himself from the reality of what he has done. I think it's very very sad that he's waited until all the evidence has been presented before he has admitted his guilt. ""We can't lose sight of the fact that it has involved two police officers but we haven't treated the case any differently because of that."" McKie's trainers were found in a wheelie bin with traces of his wife's blood on them Det Insp Adam Waller said McKie had ""used the knowledge gained as a police officer to try and systematically cover his tracks"" with the aim of creating the impression that his wife had been murdered by somebody else. ""He is a coward and refused to admit responsibility for his actions throughout,"" he said. In a statement, Mrs McKie's family said ""justice had been served"" but there were ""no winners in this trial"". ""Our lives will never be the same again. We have lost our beautiful daughter and our grandchildren have lost their beloved mummy,"" they added. GMP Deputy Chief Constable Ian Pilling said the force had ""lost a colleague and much-loved friend"". He added: ""Leanne was a hard-working officer who showed the utmost professionalism. She worked as a detective in the serious sexual offences unit and supported victims when they were at their most vulnerable.""

"Creditors of restaurant group Prezzo have backed a restructuring plan that will see it close 94 outlets - about a third of the chain. It is estimated the move could lead to 500 job losses. The chain, which is owned by private equity firm TPG Capital, employs about 4,500 people. The 94 closures include restaurants under the Prezzo, Mexico and Cleaver brands and all 33 Chimichanga sites . Under the rescue plan, rents will be cut by between 25% and 50% at 57 sites. The closures and rent reductions aim to repair the group's financial position and allow it to continue trading. The deal was struck under a restructuring arrangement know as a company voluntary arrangement (CVA) - a step short of going into administration. Whatâs eating the restaurant trade? Jamie Oliver closes flagship restaurant Six reasons behind the High Street crisis Jon Hendry-Pickup, chief executive of Prezzo, thanked the company's creditors and landlords for their support. He said: ""While we continue to be profitable, the pressures on our industry have been well documented. Despite this being a tough decision, the support given today by our creditors shows that they believe we have the right approach to transforming Prezzo in the eyes of teams, customers and stakeholders."" This video can not be played Trouble for High Street restaurants The restaurants identified for closure are likely to close in April and May. Prezzo said that staff would be made aware of the exact dates as soon as they had been confirmed. Prezzo was bought by TPG in 2014 for just over Â£300m. It is the latest of a number of restaurant chains to run into difficulties. Burger chain Byron and Jamie's Italian have both had to undergo similar restructurings this year, agreeing rescue plans with their lenders and landlords, and closing restaurants. The wider retail market is also suffering. The UK arm oftoy retailer Toys R Usandelectronics chain Maplinboth recently collapsed into administration. Businesses on the High Street are facing a tough environment.  Wage growth has not kept up with inflation, which has hit the spending power of shoppers. Business costs such as the National Living Wage are going up, and business rates will rise for many firms in April. Companies are also facing increasing competition from online retailers.

"This video can not be played Trump signs package to fund US government US President Donald Trump has signed a $1.3tn (Â£921bn) package to fund the government for six months, while vowing never to approve such a bill again. Hours earlier, the president threatened to veto the bill over its lack of full funding for his border wall. Congress passed the measure to avert what would have been the third shutdown of the US government this year. But many of the president's fellow Republicans railed against the measure, one calling it ""monstrous"". The spending bill needed Mr Trump's signature by a Friday midnight deadline to keep federal agencies operating until 30 September. The president suggested in a Friday morning tweet that he might reject the 2,000-page package. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

But in an afternoon news conference he said that despite the ""ridiculous"" process of passing the measure he would sign it because of its large increase in military spending. ""There's a lot of things that I'm unhappy about in this bill,"" he said, even though it was cleared by a Congress controlled by his own party. He added: ""I will never sign another bill like this again... nobody read it."" Mr Trump also told reporters: ""I looked very seriously at the veto, but because of the incredible gains we've been able to make for the military, that over-rode any of our thinking."" The vote in the Senate in the early hours of Friday caps weeks of congressional horse-trading. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The bill does not address the fate of roughly 700,000 young immigrants known as ""Dreamers"" who illegally entered the US as children. They were enrolled in the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca) programme, but President Trump ended it in September. Republicans and Democrats were unable to agree over the issue. The White House and Republicans had reportedly offered Democrats a Daca extension of up to three years in return for full funding of Mr Trump's wall. This video can not be played Daca recipients: 'Life in the US is like a rollercoaster' Democrats were said to have countered they would accept that only if a path to citizenship was guaranteed for all 1.8 million people eligible for Daca. In Friday's news conference, Mr Trump said: ""I do want the Hispanic community to know that Republicans are much more on your side than the Democrats who are using you for this purpose. ""The Democrats did not want Daca in this bill."" President Trump said he was ""not happy"" with the amount allocated to construct his planned wall on the US-Mexico border. ""But it does start the wall and we will make that $1.6bn go very far,"" he said on Friday. It was far short of the $25bn the White House had sought - and there are strings attached to the funding Congress has approved. Six things that could topple Trump's border wall Most of it can only be used to repair stretches of the 1,900 mile (3,100km) border where there already is a wall, according to the Washington Post. Under the bill, just 33 miles of new barriers can be built and only using ""bollard"" fencing or levees, not the concrete prototypes Mr Trump has viewed in photo ops, reports the newspaper. House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi appeared to taunt Republicans over funding for a wall, which her party firmly opposes. ""If you want to think you're getting a wall, just think it and sign the bill,"" she said to Mr Trump's congressional supporters. What is Dreamer debate all about? This video can not be played Trump: 'These are, like, professional mountain climbers' Analysis:Anthony Zurcher- BBCWashington Donald Trump stepped up to the podium on Friday and had to walk a fine line. He had threatened to veto the omnibus spending bill, but now he was going to sign it. He thought it was an awful bill, but it had some good parts. He said it spent way too much money, but then went through all the billions of taxpayer dollars it allocated to things he liked. Ships! Planes! Nuclear missiles! Opioid treatment! Border security! It at times sounded like he was checking his way through an extremely high-priced shopping list. The president warned that he would never sign a bill like this again - and that could be unintentionally true. If Democrats do well in November's midterm election, the next spending bill Congress turns out could look very different than the one produced by this Republican-controlled House and Senate. The bottom line is Trump took the stage and essentially admitted he had been outmaneuvered - by Democrats and some members of his own party. He was elected to change the system, but he had to acknowledge that ""that's the way right now the system works."" That had to be a tough thing to say. Several people panned Mr Trump's empty veto threat. Democratic congressman Mark Pocan accused the president of a ""loser's bluff"". ""Go ahead and veto the omnibus over Daca. We dare you,"" Mr Pocan said on Twitter. ""Everyone knows you're the reason Daca recipients are abandoned."" But despite cross-party support, at least 90 conservative Republicans voted against the bill, calling it government spending run amok. Allow Twitter content?

"The Mabna Institute is accused of hacking at least 320 universities worldwide The United States has imposed sanctions on an Iranian company and 10 individuals for alleged cyber attacks, including on hundreds of universities. The Mabna Institute is accused of stealing 31 terabytes of ""valuable intellectual property and data"". The justice department said the firm hacked 320 universities around the world, dozens of companies and parts of the US government. Nine of the 10 individuals have been indicted separately for related crimes. The two founders of the Mabna Institute are among those sanctioned and their assets are subject to US seizure, a statement by the US Treasury Department said. ""These defendants are now fugitives of justice,"" US Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein said at a news conference. Reuters reported he warned that the individuals may face extradition in more than 100 countries if they travel outside of Iran. UK think tanks 'hacked by China groups' US says Romanians hacked police cameras Russia 'hacked' 21 US states in election The Mabna Institute was established in 2013, and US prosecutors believe it was designed to help Iranian research organisations steal information. It is accused of carrying out cyber attacks on 144 US universities, and 176 universities in 21 foreign countries, including the UK, Germany, Canada, Israel and Japan. By targeting the email accounts of more than 100,000 professors worldwide, the hackers compromised about 8,000 of them, according to the justice department. US authorities described the global conspiracy as one of the largest state-sponsored hacking sprees to be prosecuted. N Korea blamed for global cyber-attack Chinese 'hackers' charged in US court ""The Department of Justice will aggressively investigate and prosecute hostile actors who attempt to profit from America's ideas by infiltrating our computer systems and stealing intellectual property,"" Mr Rosenstein said, according to news agency AFP. Many of these ""intrusions"", Mr Rosenstein said, were done ""at the behest of the Iranian government and, specifically, the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps"".

"The Greatest Showman, starring Hugh Jackman, has been a hit in both the film and music charts The Greatest Showman soundtrack is number one in the UK for the 11th week in a row - more than any other album in modern chart history except Adele's 21. The soundtrack hasn't loosened its grip on the top spot since January, and has seen off competition from the likes of Craig David and Camila Cabello. It has sold 465,000 copies - more than 40% of which have been on CD and vinyl, the Official Charts Company said. The success comes despite lukewarm reviews for the movie itself. The Telegraph declared it ""completely and utterly bibbly bibbly quack-quack insane"", while the Evening Standard called it ""a load of big top baloney"". But the film, which stars Hugh Jackman as circus entrepreneur PT Barnum, defied the critics to become a major box office success. In the UK, it has sold Â£37.5m worth of tickets, second only to Black Panther in 2018. Many fans are paying to see the film multiple times, with a knock-on effect on the success of the soundtrack, which has also spawned the top 40 hits This Is Me and Rewrite The Stars. When it first reached number one, on its third week of release, songwriters Benj Pasek and Justin Paul said they were ""honoured and thrilled"" by its reception in the UK. How The Greatest Showman became a film phenomenon ""The universal themes of inclusion and acceptance are what inspired every song on the soundtrack, and we couldn't be more proud of everyone involved,"" they told the Official Charts Company. The album, released by Atlantic Records, now has the the joint-longest consecutive run at the top spot in the past 30 years, along with Adele's 21 in 2011. Adele's album 21 was knocked off the top spot after 11 weeks Other albums that have enjoyed long consecutive spells at the summit include Madonna's Immaculate Collection (nine weeks in 1990), the Eurythmics' Greatest Hits (nine weeks in 1991), The Beatles' greatest hits collection 1 (nine weeks in 2000), and Ed Sheeran's Divide (nine weeks in 2017). The overall record for the longest ever spell at number one is held by the South Pacific soundtrack, which was number one for a mammoth 70 weeks in a row from 1958-1960. Meanwhile, on this week's singles chart, Drake also sustains a long run at the summit - with God's Plan notching up its ninth week in pole position. That means Rudimental's These Days has to settle for a seventh week at number two. It is now one of only three singles to spend so long in second place without reaching number one. The others are I Swear by All-4-One in 1994, and Moves Like Jagger by Maroon 5 and Christina Aguilera in 2011. Elsewhere in this week's top five, George Ezra's Paradise climbs seven places to number five, earning his third top 10 hit. The star's second album, Staying At Tamara's, will be The Greatest Showman's biggest competition in the albums chart next week.

"The Mabna Institute is accused of hacking at least 320 universities worldwide The United States has imposed sanctions on an Iranian company and 10 individuals for alleged cyber attacks, including on hundreds of universities. The Mabna Institute is accused of stealing 31 terabytes of ""valuable intellectual property and data"". The justice department said the firm hacked 320 universities around the world, dozens of companies and parts of the US government. Nine of the 10 individuals have been indicted separately for related crimes. The two founders of the Mabna Institute are among those sanctioned and their assets are subject to US seizure, a statement by the US Treasury Department said. ""These defendants are now fugitives of justice,"" US Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein said at a news conference. Reuters reported he warned that the individuals may face extradition in more than 100 countries if they travel outside of Iran. UK think tanks 'hacked by China groups' US says Romanians hacked police cameras Russia 'hacked' 21 US states in election The Mabna Institute was established in 2013, and US prosecutors believe it was designed to help Iranian research organisations steal information. It is accused of carrying out cyber attacks on 144 US universities, and 176 universities in 21 foreign countries, including the UK, Germany, Canada, Israel and Japan. By targeting the email accounts of more than 100,000 professors worldwide, the hackers compromised about 8,000 of them, according to the justice department. US authorities described the global conspiracy as one of the largest state-sponsored hacking sprees to be prosecuted. N Korea blamed for global cyber-attack Chinese 'hackers' charged in US court ""The Department of Justice will aggressively investigate and prosecute hostile actors who attempt to profit from America's ideas by infiltrating our computer systems and stealing intellectual property,"" Mr Rosenstein said, according to news agency AFP. Many of these ""intrusions"", Mr Rosenstein said, were done ""at the behest of the Iranian government and, specifically, the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps"". The hackers also targeted the US Department of Labor, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the United Nations, according to prosecutors.

"Dominic Cummings appeared before MPs in April 2016 The director of Vote Leave has denied allegations of links between his campaign and Cambridge Analytica. Dominic Cummings said claims by the Observer newspaper are ""factually wrong, hopelessly confused, or nonsensical"". Cambridge Analytica is facing claims it amassed the data of millions of people without their consent. The Observer is expected to publish further claims about links between the official Brexit campaign and the firm. Kunessberg: Cummings hits out Cambridge Analytica: The story so far Cambridge Analytica chief recalled by MPs Cambridge Analytica is at the centre of a row over whether it used the personal data of millions of Facebook users to sway the outcome of the US 2016 presidential election and the UK Brexit referendum. Mr Cummings claimed stories alleging links with Vote Leave were being promoted because a ""powerful set of people will do anything to try to shift public opinion in order that they can overturn the referendum"". He says testimonies he expects to be made public in the coming days were from ""whistleblowers"" who were ""peripheral, making invented claims about things they didn't see"". Mr Cummings has also published emails that appear to suggest Chris Wylie, who has been at the centre of the allegations about Cambridge Analytica, tried to sell Vote Leave a similar service, but was turned down. Mr Wylie's lawyers have been contacted for a response. The blog also rejects any suggestions that Vote Leave was in any way linked to Cambridge Analytica. Vote Leave spent Â£2.7m on the services of a Canadian digital agency Aggregate AIQ in the run-up to the June 2016 EU referendum. In his blog, Mr Cummings says AIQ ""once built some software"" for Cambridge Analytica's parent company SCL, in 2014, but suggestions the company shared data with Cambridge Analytica were ""ludicrous"". In a separate development, Brittany Kaiser, Cambridge Analytica's former business development director, hastold the Guardian the firm carried out data analysis for Leave.EU,external, the rival Brexit campaign to Vote Leave that was fronted by Nigel Farage. Cambridge Analytica has said it did ""no paid or unpaid work"" for Leave.EU. Ms Kaiser claims in The Guardian some work was undertaken, although no payment was received. Leave.EU's co-founder Arron Banks said: ""Leave.EU did not receive any data or work from Cambridge Analytica. ""UKIP did give Cambridge Analytica some of its data and Cambridge Analytica did some analysis of this. ""But it was not used in the Brexit campaign. Cambridge Analytica tried to make me pay for that work but I refused. It had nothing to do with us."" Cambridge Analytica has suspended its CEO, Alexander Nix, who was filmed as part of a Channel 4 investigation giving examples of how the firm could swing elections around the world with underhand tactics such as smear campaigns and honey traps. The company has offered to hand over all communications between its elections arm, SCL Elections Ltd, and a firm run by academic Dr Aleksandr Kogan by 5pm on Monday to the Information Commissioner, the High Court heard. Lawyers representing the Information Commissioner's Office, which is investigating allegations against the firm, said its offer was ""a poor second best"" and are pursuing their application for a warrant. Both Cambridge Analytica and Facebook deny any wrongdoing. The hearing before Judge Leonard continues. A group of campaigning lawyers have, meanwhile, won the first stage of their High Court challenge over election spending in the run-up to the EU referendum. The Good Law Project (GLP) says the Electoral Commission failed in its duty to regulate the referendum process in relation to spending by the Vote Leave campaign ahead of the vote in 2016.

"A shadow cabinet minister has broken ranks with official Labour Party policy to call for another Brexit referendum. Shadow Northern Ireland Secretary Owen Smith said a vote should be held when talks with the EU have concluded. Inan article for the Guardian,,externalhe also called for Labour to back membership of the EU single market. Labour's shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer said the party was ""not calling for a referendum at this stage"". Jeremy Corbyn announced last month that Labour wanted the UK to be a permanent member of a customs union with the EU after Brexit. May urges 'new dynamic' in Brexit talks Corbyn backs customs union membership But Mr Smith, who unsuccessfully challenged Mr Corbyn for the Labour leadership in 2016, said that was not enough. ""If we insist on leaving the EU then there is realistically only one way to honour our obligations under the Good Friday Agreement and that is to remain members of both the customs union and the single market,"" he said in his article. ""I'm pleased my party has taken a big step in this direction by backing continued customs union membership, but we need to go further."" He argued that Labour ""needs to do more than just back a soft Brexit or guarantee a soft border in Ireland"". ""Given that it is increasingly obvious that the promises the Brexiters made to the voters - especially, but not only, their pledge of an additional Â£350m a week for the NHS - are never going to be honoured, we have the right to keep asking if Brexit remains the right choice for the country. ""And to ask, too, that the country has a vote on whether to accept the terms, and true costs of that choice, once they are clear. That is how Labour can properly serve our democracy and the interests of our people."" Steve Baker accused Labour of ""frustrating"" Brexit Conservative Brexit Minister Steve Baker accused Labour of ""trying to frustrate the Brexit process"". ""These comments show that on one of the biggest issues facing the country, Labour have no interest in making a success of it, betraying millions of Labour voters. ""Only the Conservatives are getting on with delivering what British people voted for, taking back control of our laws, borders and money."" Sir Keir Starmer said Labour's position was that the ""benefits of the single market and customs union... need to be hard-wired into the final agreement"". ""We want a strong relationship with the single market with no drop-offs in rights, standards or protections,"" he added. Asked if Mr Smith was going against official party policy with his comments, Sir Keir said: ""That's not a matter for me to comment on. My focus is on ensuring we are challenging the government appropriately on the negotiations with the EU. "" Mr Smith argued for a second EU referendum during his abortive Labour leadership bid - but Jeremy Corbyn has consistently ruled one out, saying that the public had come to a decision, and has insisted the UK cannot remain in the single market. Chuka Umunna backs Owen Smith's comments Other shadow cabinet members have appeared more open to the idea of another referendum. In January 2018, shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show she would consider it only in exceptional circumstances - ""if 90% of the population was now saying we will stay in the European Union"". Labour's deputy leader, Tom Watson, did not rule out a second referendum, in a December 2017 interview with BBC Radio 5 Live's Pienaar's Politics, but added: ""What we actually want is a negotiated settlement."" Anti-Brexit Labour backbenchers such as Chuka Umunna, a member of the cross-party Open Britain campaign, have also argued for a second referendum. Mr Umunna said Mr Smith was ""absolutely right"" to say that Labour ""needs to go further in opposing the government on Brexit"", saying the Leave campaign had made promises ""we now know cannot be delivered on"". ""If we are not going to be offered the Brexit we were promised we have every right to ask whether Brexit is the right path for the country,"" he said.

"International experts are due in the UK, to test samples of the nerve agent used in the attempted murder of a spy and his daughter. How do they keep track of the world's most toxic chemicals? After collecting samples of the poisons used on Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia, a team from the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) will conduct tests, with results expected to take at least a fortnight. The UK government says the substance used was Novichok - a group of nerve agents it says is ""stockpiled"" by Russia, which is ""culpable"" for the attack. It has dismissed Russia's claim that the poison came from the UK's Porton Down facility. The work of the OPCW is carried out as part of an international control regime that governs what is, or is not, permissible as far as very toxic chemicals are concerned. This was established by the1997 Chemical Weapons Convention,external(CWC), to which 192 countries are signed up members. Only four countries are outside the CWC - North Korea, Israel, Egypt and South Sudan, which has begun the process of signing. They are still bound by the treaty's provisions, under international law. The CWC's operational arm, the Hague-based inspectors of the OPCW, have overseenthe destruction of nearly 97% of the world's declared stockpiles of chemical weapons,external. Countries agree to never manufacture, stockpile or use chemical weapons - nor to assist others to do so. They are also required to declare what stocks of chemical weapons they have and where they could be produced. These declarations are used by OPCW inspectors to audit the destruction of chemical weapons and production facilities - a process that should happen within 10 years. Most countries meet this deadline, but Russia, which inherited the former Soviet Union stocks, and the US did not. The sheer size of their arsenals, the technical challenge of disarmament and costs have caused delays. What are Novichok nerve agents? Russian spy: What we know so far Several months ago,Russia announced it had completed destruction of its nearly 40,000 tonnes,externalof declared agents - the largest stockpile in the world. There is no dispute about this as the process was carried out under the watchful eyes of the OPCW's inspectors. The US has destroyed some 90% of its declared stocks, with 2021-22 earmarked as the target date for completion. Its challenges have included persuading local communities that the work could be safely carried out in their neighbourhoods. But what about other chemicals and the Novichoks in particular? Specialist officers in protective suits investigate the location in Salisbury, Wiltshire, where Sergei and Yulia Skripal were found The Novichoks - those thought to have been used against the Skripals - were never declared to the OPCW, and the chemicals never formed part of any control regime partly because of uncertainty about their chemical structures. And specific names are crucial, because the CWC allows countries to legally possess a wide range of chemicals if they are identifiable. Under the convention, countries are allowed stocks of toxic chemicals and their precursors for peaceful purposes including industry, agriculture, research and medicine. For recognised or potential chemical weapons, and chemicals that may be involved in their manufacture, only limited quantities can be kept. Signatories are allowed to hold a combined total of one tonne and one facility, usually a laboratory, where these substances can be made. These stocks can be used  to develop protective clothing, gas masks, antidotes and for developing methods to identify chemical weapons. Auditing of these stocks by the OPCW is down to the milligram level. For other substances more widely used in industry, but which may be used to make chemical weapons, stocks are closely monitored. Complete records of the quantities manufactured, sold, used or disposed of must be kept by governments and the information passed to the OPCW every year. OPCW headquarters in The Hague, the Netherlands It audits these returns and carries hundreds of inspections of industrial premises globally every year. Where are the UK's youngest and oldest city populations? Hawking's warnings: What he predicted about the future Plastic particles found in bottled water French island residents round up 'foreigners' Although the Novichoks fall outside these controls, and no country has declared possession to the OPCW, their existence became known in the 1990s. It is quite likely that some government laboratories made minute quantities. Their characteristics would have been stored in databases, so that their identity could be confirmed at a later stage if found as an unknown poison in someone's blood. Whether this has happened in the UK's chemical defence laboratory is not known. But it is important that the scientists working there were able to identify the Novichok nerve agent used to poison the Skripals as rapidly as they did. Identifying the agent is vital for the medical treatment the Skripals and Det Sgt Nick Bailey - the police officer injured in the attack - will be receiving. Correction 20 March 2018: An earlier version of this story stated that there were three countries - North Korea, Israel and Egypt which had not ratified the CWC. It is also the case that South Sudan - which is in the process of signing - has not yet ratified.

"Members of the House of Lords have called on the government to reconsider awarding a contract to print new blue UK passports to a Franco-Dutch firm. Conservative peer Lord Naseby said it would have a major adverse effect on ""the whole of British industry, and the British people as they face Brexit"". The burgundy passport, in use since 1988, will revert to its original blue and gold colour from October 2019. Gemalto has won the contract ahead of the current UK producer De La Rue. Lord Naseby said that he wanted an assurance that ""nothing will be signed or sealed until the whole matter's been reviewed"". Will UK passports be made abroad? UK firm to contest new passport decision However, fellow Conservative Lord Courtown said that as a member of the European Union, the UK had to abide by procurement rules. He denied that there were any security issue in awarding the Â£490m contract to Gemalto, adding that some 20% of blank passports were already manufactured overseas and would continue to be personalised in the UK. Lord Courtown said that the decision would save the UK Â£120m over the course of the contract. But Lord Forsyth, a Conservative former cabinet minister, said the government was taking an ""extraordinary position"" while Labour peer Lord Foulkes said the matter should be reviewed ""in the name of not just security, but of national pride"". De La Rue, which has printed the burgundy version of the British passport since 2009, said that it been ""undercut on price"" by Gemalto.

"The UK prime minister welcomed a ""new dynamic"" in the talks EU leaders have approved guidelines for the negotiation of future relations with the UK after Brexit. The text,externalon trade, security and other issues was agreed in ""less than half a minute"", clearing the way for the next phase of Brexit talks to get under way. The UK is due to leave in March 2019 and negotiators have said they want a deal in place by the end of the year. Prime Minister Theresa May said she believed there was a new ""spirit of co-operation and opportunity"". The formal adoption of the guidelines, although widely expected, is seen as another key step as the Brexit process gathers momentum. The guidelines give chief negotiator Michel Barnier the mandate to talk directly to the UK about the future relationship with a view to reaching a broad political agreement by October to allow the EU and UK parliaments time to consider it. Pienaar: So can May now survive Brexit course? Reality Check: What have EU leaders agreed on Brexit? Labour frontbencher backs second EU vote European Council President Donald Tusk said the ""positive momentum"" should be used to settle outstanding issues like avoiding a hard border in Northern Ireland. EU leaders will decide in June whether the ""Irish question"" has been resolved and will look into a ""common declaration on our future"", he added. Mrs May, who was not present when her colleagues met to discuss Brexit, said she believed there was a ""new dynamic"" in the negotiations. ""I believe we are approaching this with a spirit of co-operation, a spirit of opportunity for the future as well, and we will now be sitting down and determining those workable solutions for Northern Ireland, but also for our future security partnership and economic partnership,"" she said. ""I believe it is in the best interest of both the UK and the EU that we get a deal that actually is in the interests of both."" By the BBC's Europe reporter Adam Fleming EU leaders have given their chief negotiator Michel Barnier a mandate to talk about trade While welcoming the progress so far, there is a reminder that there is no legal certainty, including over the transition deal, until the whole agreement is ratified. Last-minute wrangling by Spain has led to the inclusion of a reference to the EU's position on Gibraltar. It says that Spain and the UK have to reach a separate deal over it. The EU's big offer is a close future relationship based on a free trade agreement with no tariffs on goods and a close partnership on security and defence, both of which the UK wants. The UK's ""red lines"" will limit the closeness of the future relationship. A sentence says Brexit will cause economic consequences for both sides, which was tweaked to specify the UK would be the worse off. What has been dubbed the ""evolution clause"" indicates that the EU will reconsider its offer to Britain if the UK government compromises on its red lines, such as by remaining in the customs union. The EU fears competition from the UK and is demanding a ""level playing field"" between the two - including ways to prevent potential undercutting on tax, environmental and labour standards. While not directly mentioning financial services, the EU says it will jealously guard its financial stability. The remaining 27 leaders have also endorsed an agreement reached earlier this week on a 21-month transition period between March 2019, when the UK officially leaves, and the end of 2020. During that period, the UK will be able to negotiate, sign and ratify its own trade deals, while EU citizens arriving in the UK will enjoy the same rights and guarantees as those who arrive before Brexit. A solution to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland has yet to be agreed, with the EU insisting on a ""backstop"" option of Northern Ireland, in effect, remaining in the customs union. Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said he wanted an agreement that keeps the UK ""as close as possible"" to the EU in order to protect trade and jobs. But Labour, which supports staying in the customs union, said the UK and EU were a ""very long way away"" from achieving this at the moment and the PM needed to ""finally drop her reckless red lines"". Meanwhile, EU leaders are calling for reciprocal access to UK fishing waters and stocks to be maintained after the end of the transition period. Asked whether he thought the UK would agree to this, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker told BBC Scotland this was the EU's ""working basis"". ""We are in ongoing discussions with the UK - to try and bring them (to) where we are and they are trying to bring us (to) where they are,"" he said. The UK has already agreed to abide by the rules of the Common Fisheries Policy during the transition, sparking anger among fishing groups which want full sovereignty over UK waters upon Brexit.

"One gendarme has been hailed a hero after volunteering to swap places with a hostage and then using his phone to relay information to police outside Armed police have killed a suspect who shot dead three people in a series of attacks in southern France. The heavily armed gunman hijacked a car and then took hostages at a supermarket in the town of TrÃ¨bes. The man, named as 26-year-old Redouane Lakdim, said he was fighting on behalf of the Islamic State group. He is believed to have killed and wounded his victims in three separate incidents which began in Carcassonne, 15 minutes' drive from TrÃ¨bes. Later, President Emmanuel Macron said 16 people had been injured in the attack. Among them is a gendarme who swapped places with a hostage. Mr Macron said the man, who has been hailed for his heroism, was fighting for his life in hospital. He was shot several times, Paris prosecutor Francois Molins told reporters. One person has been arrested in connection with the shootings, he added. The suspect is said to have been demanding the release of Salah Abdeslam, the most important surviving suspect in the 13 November 2015 attacks in Paris, which killed 130 people. Mr Macron called the attack an act of ""Islamist terrorism"". Five things about Paris attacks suspect Salah Abdeslam The attacker began his spree of attacks on Friday morning in Carcassonne, where he first hijacked a car, killing one passenger - whose body was later found hidden in a bush - and injuring the driver. He then shot and wounded a policeman who was jogging with colleagues. The suspect is then believed to have driven a few kilometres to the small town of TrÃ¨bes, where he charged into the Super-U supermarket, shouting, ""I am a soldier of Daesh [Islamic State]!"" and took hostages. Carole, who was shopping at the supermarket, said people hid in a cold room. ""A man shouted and fired several times. I saw a cold room door, I asked people to come and take shelter,"" she told France info radio. ""There were 10 of us, and we stayed an hour. There were more gunshots and we went out the emergency back door."" This video can not be played ""This was a heroic act"" on the part of the lieutenant-colonel, says Interior Minister GÃ©rard Collomb Interior Minister GÃ©rard Collomb told reporters that police officers managed to get some people out, but that the gunman held one woman back as a human shield. It was at this point, he said, that the 45-year-old gendarme volunteered to swap himself for her - and left his mobile phone on a table with an open line so police could monitor the situation, When police heard gunshots, an elite Swat team stormed the supermarket. The gunman was killed but the gendarme was seriously injured, and another officer was also hurt. Mr Collomb hailed the ""heroism and courage"" of the gendarme, a lieutenant-colonel. Redouane Lakdim, reportedly from a Moroccan background, was known to French intelligence services, said Mr Collomb. ""He was known for petty crimes,"" including small-time drug-dealing, he said. ""We had monitored him and thought there was no radicalisation,"" he said. Has very active on Salafist social networks andincarcerated in Carcassonne in 2016, reports Le Parisien,external. Salafism is a hardline offshoot of Sunni Islam. He is also suspected of making a trip to Syria, though that is unconfirmed, Le Parisien adds. Lakdim lived in an apartment in Carcassonne with his parents and several sisters - one of whom a neighbour saw him taking to school on Friday morning. That apartment has now reportedly been raided by police. In a statement released online, Islamic State claimed the attacker was ""a soldier of the Islamic State"" - a claim President Macron said the security services were studying. French President Emmanuel Macron was informed about the hostage crisis while giving a news conference at an EU summit in Brussels Mr Macron was at an EU summit in Brussels when the attack took place but said he would return to oversee the response. France has been hit with several deadly jihadist attacks since 2015 and has been on high alert since. A state of emergency put in place after the 2015 attacks in Paris was lifted in October. In February, Salah Abdeslam went on trial in Belgium over a shootout in Brussels that led to his capture months after the Paris attacks. He is not expected to go on trial in France until 2020 at the earliest. 1 Oct 2017 -Two women stabbed to death at Marseille railway station; attack claimed by IS 26 Jul 2016 -Two attackers slit priest's throat at his church in Normandy; shot dead by police 14 Jul 2016 -Huge lorry mows down crowd on Nice beachfront, killing 86.

"The PM sought support from her European counterparts in Brussels Russia has accused the European Union of following an ""anti-Russian campaign launched by London"" over the nerve agent attack on a former double agent. Moscow denies responsibility for the attack on ex-spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in Salisbury on 4 March. The bench the pair were sitting on when they were found unconscious has been removed by a team in protective suits, as the investigation continues. On Thursday, the EU said it was ""highly likely"" Russia was behind the attack. The European Council said it stood in ""unqualified solidarity"" with the UK, after Prime Minister Theresa May briefed her counterparts on the poisoning. Ms May welcomed the EU support, saying that it was right ""we are standing together"" as the threat posed by Russia ""respects no borders and it is a threat to our values"". The bench where the Skripals were found ill has been removed by a team of experts French President Emmanuel Macron, who is leaving the summit in Brussels amid ahostage situation in southern France, said France and Germany would take ""rapid, coordinated measures"" in response to the Salisbury attack. He and Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel plan to announce a series of steps against Moscow soon. Artyom Kozhin, Russia's foreign ministry spokesman, said the move had the ""obvious purpose of creating yet another obstacle to normalising the situation on the European continent"". He said: ""We regret that the EU chose to follow another anti-Russian campaign launched by London and its allies from across the ocean.""

"Michel Castellucci (pictured right), had an active social media presence until reports about the Snapchat posts were published An EasyJet captain and his co-pilot have been suspended amid reports they filmed Snapchat videos during a flight. The captain,named by The Sun as Michel Castellucci,external, uploaded clips of his colleague interacting with animated characters generated by the messaging app. Footage appears to show the pair inside a cockpit next to a computer-generated woman and a dancing owl. Passenger safety was not compromised at any point, the airline said. The BBC has not been able to reach Mr Castellucci for comment, who appears to have deleted his social media accounts since reports about the Snapchat posts emerged. According to the paper, he filmed the videos ""at 30,000ft"" during a flight from Paris to Madrid. It said it had been contacted by passengers who had branded the stunt ""dangerous"" and ""irresponsible"". A spokeswoman for Luton-based EasyJet said it happened when the aircraft was not carrying out any manoeuvre and the flight operated safely. She said: ""Whilst at no point was the safety of the passengers compromised, this falls well short of the high standards EasyJet expects of its pilots. ""It is not acceptable and is not representative of the thousands of highly professional pilots who work for the airline. ""We take this issue seriously and, as such, the pilots have been suspended (in line with our procedures) pending a disciplinary investigation.""

"Fernandez, who has no technical training, created the IEDs in his bedroom as he believed a ""period of war and famine was coming"" A binman who stockpiled 250 explosive devices and supplies as he believed a ""period of war and famine was coming"" has been jailed for 40 months. Reeco Fernandez, 29, suffered 22% burns after accidentally blowing himself up. At Bristol Crown Court, he admitted five counts of possessing an explosive substance for an unlawful purpose. Mr Justice Dingemans said Fernandez was ""not associated with a terrorist organisation"" but had exposed himself, family and neighbours to ""real harm"". Firefighters were called to his parents' house in Bedminster, Bristol, last September after neighbours heard a loud boom and saw smoke. Military equipment and explosives were discovered in his bedroom, under the stairs and in a garden shed at the three-bedroom terraced house in Hastings Close. The entire street had to be evacuated when an improvised explosive device (IED) Fernandez had made in his bedroom exploded Fernandez, who has no technical training and created the improvised explosive devices (IEDs) is his bedroom, was taken to hospital, where he remained for 18 days. About 40 properties were evacuated, roads were closed and a 100m (330ft) cordon set up. Star Wars firm to pay Vader film damages Tube bomber jailed for life Mary Cowe, for Fernandez, said a psychologist found he had an ""eccentric belief about what the future holds"". ""He talked about being told in 2013 that a period of war and famine was coming and he could do something about it,"" she said. The court was also shown mobile phone footage of Fernandez experimenting with explosives - including devices involving ball bearings - in a wood near his home in 2016 and 2017. Experts found 141 IEDs modified from shotgun cartridges, 96 IEDs from modified fireworks, 10 grenades, and four IEDs from other cartridges Sentencing Fernandez, the judge said: ""There was no evidence of terrorism. The explosion was an immensely misguided act which exposed yourself and others who you loved and your neighbours to real harm."" After sentencing, Avon and Somerset Police said grenades, pipe-bombs, and arrows with explosive heads had all been found hidden around Fernandez's home. Assistant chief constable Caroline Peter said he had been ""making his own preparations"" for impending world disaster for some time. ""He comes from a supportive family who were aware of his interests but who viewed his activities as nothing more than a hobby,"" she said. ""He has certainly paid a very hefty price for his hobby, showing a reckless disregard for his and his family's safety and the threat his activities posed to the local community.""

"Creditors of restaurant group Prezzo have backed a restructuring plan that will see it close 94 outlets - about a third of the chain. It is estimated the move could lead to 500 job losses. The chain, which is owned by private equity firm TPG Capital, employs about 4,500 people. The 94 closures include restaurants under the Prezzo, Mexico and Cleaver brands and all 33 Chimichanga sites . Under the rescue plan, rents will be cut by between 25% and 50% at 57 sites. The closures and rent reductions aim to repair the group's financial position and allow it to continue trading. The deal was struck under a restructuring arrangement know as a company voluntary arrangement (CVA) - a step short of going into administration. Whatâs eating the restaurant trade? Jamie Oliver closes flagship restaurant Six reasons behind the High Street crisis Jon Hendry-Pickup, chief executive of Prezzo, thanked the company's creditors and landlords for their support. He said: ""While we continue to be profitable, the pressures on our industry have been well documented. Despite this being a tough decision, the support given today by our creditors shows that they believe we have the right approach to transforming Prezzo in the eyes of teams, customers and stakeholders."" This video can not be played Trouble for High Street restaurants The restaurants identified for closure are likely to close in April and May. Prezzo said that staff would be made aware of the exact dates as soon as they had been confirmed. Prezzo was bought by TPG in 2014 for just over Â£300m. It is the latest of a number of restaurant chains to run into difficulties. Burger chain Byron and Jamie's Italian have both had to undergo similar restructurings this year, agreeing rescue plans with their lenders and landlords, and closing restaurants. The wider retail market is also suffering. The UK arm oftoy retailer Toys R Usandelectronics chain Maplinboth recently collapsed into administration. Businesses on the High Street are facing a tough environment.  Wage growth has not kept up with inflation, which has hit the spending power of shoppers. Business costs such as the National Living Wage are going up, and business rates will rise for many firms in April. Companies are also facing increasing competition from online retailers.

"Some of the women rescued were underage girls Spanish police have rescued 39 women and girls smuggled in from Nigeria and trafficked into paid sex by a notorious Nigerian gang. Europol says the victims were kept in ""squalid conditions in caves"" and intimidated with voodoo threats. Gang members forced the women into paid sex in order to pay off a 30,000 euro ($37,000; Â£26,000) debt. Eighty-nine people, including a famous but as yet unnamed Nigerian DJ, have been arrested. The DJ is said to have helped move victims to Spain and organise sexual exploitation across the country. He was caught flying back into Spain after recording a music video. Find out what is happening in Africa Investigations began when an underage victim filed a complaint with the police, saying she had been pressured into trafficking by voodoo threats made in Nigeria. Along with other victims, the girl was transferred from Nigeria to Spain via Libya and Italy. The operation, which was carried out with police from the UK and Nigeria,is one of the biggest trafficking busts in Europe, says Europol,external. By Sam Piranty BBC News After our investigation in 2016, the UK's National Crime Agency flew to Barcelona to meet Mossos, the Catalan police, who conducted the investigation into the Supreme Eiye Confraternity (SEC). Information was passed over and the NCA, alongside partners in Madrid, conducted further investigation into the group, leading to these arrests. This is a major blow to the SEC, but by no means the end. We know the group have cells, or nests as SEC called them, across Europe, Africa and the Middle East. The group regularly moves women and narcotics between different cities in Europe depending on demand. We know that SEC is back at work in Barcelona, and given time, they will be sure to continue their work in the UK and the rest of Spain. This is an international network with connections across three continents and without more international cooperation like that between the NCA and Spanish police, the group will continue to thrive. Read Sam's investigation: The world of Nigeria's sex-trafficking 'Air Lords' Europol says 41 house were searched in 11 Spanish cities and one city in the UK. According to Europol, the criminal cartel had links to the Eiye brotherhood, one of the most influential groups in Nigeria. The gang was allegedly operating all over the world and pumping money back into the network. Bank accounts allegedly used to illegally transfer more than 300,000 euro ($370,000; Â£260,000) have been blocked.

"Ed Sheeran made a Comic Relief film in Liberia last year Sport Relief isn't using appeal films showing stars visiting developing countries after complaints that they were akin to ""poverty tourism"". Sport Relief, which is on TV on the BBC on Friday, takes place every other year, alternating with Red Nose Day. The Comic Relief charity runs both events and said most of its films would just feature people who live in those countries speaking for themselves. MP David Lammy had said they portrayed Africans as ""victims to be pitied"". The Sport Relief and Red Nose Day telethons usually feature clips of well-known personalities meeting people in places where the charity works, including Africa. But Comic Relief chief executive Liz Warner said: ""This year, we are putting people at the heart of the films. ""We haven't sent celebrities, for the night of TV, to Africa. People are telling their stories in their own voices, and we are using local heroes."" A 2017 Red Nose Day film fronted by Ed Sheeran, about street children in Liberia, was named the ""most offensive"" campaign last year by a fundraising pressure group. In it, the singer was seen meeting a young boy before offering to pay for a hotel for him and his friends.The Radi-Aid awards,externalsaid it was almost ""poverty tourism"". Allow YouTube content?

Warner told Radio 4's World at One they were continuing to work with celebrities - just in a different way. ""It's in our DNA,"" she said of having stars at the centre of their campaigns. ""But we're continuing to evolve how we make our films."" Asked about the Sheeran film, she added: ""We're very proud of what Ed did. The celebrities give of their time and they do amazing things for us. We're just trying to work out how we work with them."" Ball cycled more than 350 miles from her home town to where she lives now The charity plans to enlist more celebrities to speak about issues that are close to their hearts - such as withZoe Ball's cycling challenge to raise awareness of male mental health. Friday's Sport Relief will include a film about street children in Uganda. It will be introduced by Rio Ferdinand, but he will not appear in the clip himself. Instead, it will feature the children and a charity worker. Stars will appear in films about the UK, though, with John Bishop fronting a clip about a project near his home in the north-west of England. This video can not be played David Lammy says African people are ""equals to be respected, not as victims to be pitied"". Sport Relief, which aims to raise millions for disadvantaged people in the UK and around the world, is a week-long event this year, culminating in the live broadcast on Friday night. The move comes after David Lammy made a film for BBC Two's Daily Politics, saying Comic Relief had ""tattooed images of poverty in Africa to our national psyche"" - and was not showing the full reality of life on the continent. ""Sports Relief should be helping to establish the people of Africa as equals to be respected, not as victims to be pitied,"" he said. ""So, rather than getting celebrities to act as tour guides, why not get Africans to talk for themselves about the continent and the problems that they know?"" Lammy has agreed to talk to Comic Relief - and has been invited to make a film for them himself. He said on Friday: ""I am pleased that Comic Relief has listened to concerns that I have raised and will be making changes to their output. ""I hope that the films they make will respect and empower African people and amplify their voices instead of patronising them. This represents a step in the right direction and some progress.""

"The PM sought support from her European counterparts in Brussels Russia has accused the European Union of following an ""anti-Russian campaign launched by London"" over the nerve agent attack on a former double agent. Moscow denies responsibility for the attack on ex-spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in Salisbury on 4 March. The bench the pair were sitting on when they were found unconscious has been removed by a team in protective suits, as the investigation continues. On Thursday, the EU said it was ""highly likely"" Russia was behind the attack. The European Council said it stood in ""unqualified solidarity"" with the UK, after Prime Minister Theresa May briefed her counterparts on the poisoning. Ms May welcomed the EU support, saying that it was right ""we are standing together"" as the threat posed by Russia ""respects no borders and it is a threat to our values"". The bench where the Skripals were found ill has been removed by a team of experts French President Emmanuel Macron, who is leaving the summit in Brussels amid ahostage situation in southern France, said France and Germany would take ""rapid, coordinated measures"" in response to the Salisbury attack. He and Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel plan to announce a series of steps against Moscow soon. Artyom Kozhin, Russia's foreign ministry spokesman, said the move had the ""obvious purpose of creating yet another obstacle to normalising the situation on the European continent"". He said: ""We regret that the EU chose to follow another anti-Russian campaign launched by London and its allies from across the ocean.""

"Karen McDougal says she was tricked into staying silent about the alleged affair Former Playboy model Karen McDougal, who claims she had an affair with President Donald Trump in 2006, has apologised to his wife Melania Trump. In a CNN interview,Ms McDougal said she would tell the first lady she was sorry for the alleged 10-month affair,externaland she ""wouldn't want it done to me"". She also said she cried on the way home after Mr Trump offered her money during their first encounter. The president and the White House have both denied the alleged affair. ""I'm sorry. I wouldn't want it done to me,"" she told CNN's Anderson Cooper on Thursday. ""When I look back, where I was back then, I know it's wrong,"" she said in an emotional plea. ""I'm really sorry for that. I know it's a wrong thing to do."" This video can not be played Legal problems mount for Trump Ms McDougal signed a deal worth $150,000 (Â£106,000) to tell her story exclusively to the tabloid newspaper, the National Enquirer, in 2016. However, the article was never published and Ms McDougal insists she was tricked into silence about the relationship. She is now suing the publication to end the deal. Ms McDougal is one of three women who have launched law suits over affairs or sexual assault claims involving the president. These are the other two: Stephanie Clifford, better known as Stormy Daniels, says she also had an affair with Donald Trump in 2006 Porn actress Stormy Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, says she and Mr Trump had sex in a hotel room during a celebrity golf tournament in 2006. She says that she was paid $130,000 (around Â£92,000) by Mr Trump's lawyer to remain silent about the affair just before the 2016 election. Ms Clifford has now filed a lawsuit which aims to scrap the agreement, which her lawyer says she was physically threatened into accepting. Earlier this year, an interview she gave to InTouch magazine in 2011 about her alleged relationship with Mr Trump resurfaced. A polygraph test from the interview obtained by CBS News concluded that she had been ""truthful""in her account. The president has denied any sexual relationship with the actress. His lawyers are now suing Ms Daniels for $20m (Â£14m) for breaching the non-disclosure agreement. An interview with Ms Daniels is due to air on CBS News on Sunday. This video can not be played Summer Zervos said she had no option but to sue Mr Trump to restore her reputation Summer Zervos, a former contestant on The Apprentice, was one of a number of women who made allegations of sexual misconduct against Donald Trump during the 2016 presidential race. She accuses Mr Trump of sexually assaulting her at a Beverly Hills hotel in 2007. Ms Zervos says that he groped her and ""began thrusting his genitals"" during a meeting to discuss employment opportunities. While president-elect, Mr Trump dismissed the allegations against him and said that Ms Zervos and other accusers were ""sick"" and driven by fame, money or politics. Ms Zervos filed a defamation law suit against Mr Trump in January 2017, but his lawyers argued that as the president he could not be sued. A judge in New York has now overturned that decision, meaning that Ms Zervos's case against the president will continue.

"Annual profits at Next have fallen 8% after what the retailer described as its most challenging year for 25 years. The company said pre-tax profits dropped to Â£726.1m in the 12 months to January, marking the second year in a row that profit has declined. Next said that sales of full-priced products at its stores tumbled in contrast to online demand. It blamed ""a weak clothing market"" as well as ""self-inflicted product ranging errors and omissions"". Full priced sales at its shops fell by 7% but rose by 11.2% online. Total revenue for the year fell by 0.5% to Â£4.1bn. Next's chief executive, Lord Wolfson, said,externalthat ""in many ways 2017 was the most challenging year we have faced for 25 years"". He said that while it had been uncomfortable, ""it has also prompted us to take a fresh look at almost everything we do"" including the structure of its shop portfolio and the ""in-store experience"". Experts on the retail sector say mid-priced retailers like Next are in a tough spot. ""The middle market is suffering and there isn't a way back home,"" Kate Hardcastle, from consultancy Insight with Passion, told the BBC. ""I think retail generally in this market place has been quite lazy,"" she said. Shoppers have moved towards retailers that are cheaper, or are quicker to respond to fashion trends, according to Ms Hardcastle. ""So you've seen the rise of Primark on the discount side, Asos and Zara on the more fashion-orientated side and a consumer very much influenced by Instagram and social media. ""It's just too much of a turnaround, too much of a challenge for these quite heavyweight retailers who have expected to trade the way that they always have,"" Ms Hardcastle said. Coming to a Next near you? The retailer plans to roll out concessions this year The latest retail data from the Office for National Statisticsshowed a rise in sales at supermarkets in February, but falling trade at non-food stores as consumers choose to spend their money on essential items. A number of retailers and casual dining outlets have failed or face having to radically restructure their businesses. Both Toys R Us and Maplin have fallen into administration. Fashion chain New Look this week secured an agreement with its creditors to close 60 UK stores and cut 1,000 jobs. In the restaurant sector, Jamie's Italian, burger chain Byron and Prezzo are closing outlets and laying off staff. Next said that it planned to roll out more concessions across its store after trying out a number of new services at its shop in Manchester's Arndale Centre. These include; a florist, a prosecco bar, a restaurant, a children's activity centre, a cafÃ©, a card and stationery shop, a barber and ""shortly a car showroom"". It said that it was in talks to add a spa operator and bridalwear concession to the store and said it expected these steps would add Â£800,000 worth of income to the shop. Next also said it was in discussions to add other services to its stores including travel, branded footwear and cosmetics. ""In the year ahead we currently plan to open 98 concessions across our store portfolio and expect to generate annualised income of around Â£5m from these concessions."" Despite the fall in profit, the figure was in line with guidance Next provided in its Christmas trading update and its share price was up 7% at Â£49.53 by midday. Over the year, profit from Next's shops fell by 24% to Â£268.7m. Sales fell 7.9% to Â£2.1bn in what the retailer said was ""a particularly difficult year"" for its stores. However, online profits rose by 7.4% to Â£461.2m, with revenue up 9.2% at Â£1.8bn. Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital, said: ""The shift in the sales performance from retail to online begs the question as to when Next will look to shift its operations away from stores and focus more on maximising its online divisional strength.""

"Brooke Kinsella set up a knife crime charity in her brother's name Former EastEnders star Brooke Kinsella has praised the soap's ""poignant"" planned storyline about knife crime. The actress, whose brother Ben was stabbed to death on a London street in 2008, is working with the show's writing team on the forthcoming plot. She believes TV soaps can have ""a huge impact"" when tackling social issues. ""It's also coming out around the 10th anniversary of Ben's death, so it's a particularly poignant time for me,"" she told BBC News. Kinsella played Kelly Taylor in the BBC soap from 2001-2004. Kinsella (right) starred in EastEnders alongside Michelle Ryan The new plot will see Shakil, played by Shaheen Jafargholi, and Keegan, played by Zack Morris, attacked. Kinsella says the subject is particularly relevant given the recentknife attacks,externalin London. ""I've done a lot of work and campaigning, and I was hoping to say 10 years on from Ben's death that things have changed and we're in a better place, and sadly I can't say that,"" Kinsella said. ""Unfortunately we're still hearing about it every day, so I think it's the right time to be highlighting it. I think we all need to be doing our bit to raise awareness."" Ben Kinsella was stabbed to death in June 2008 Kinsella praised several British soaps for using their platform to tackle big issues in recent months. A recent Coronation Streetstorylineinvolved the rape of David Platt, while Emmerdale was commended for itsdepictionof a character suffering from dementia. ""I think soap storylines can have a huge impact,"" Brooke said. ""I know that for many viewers, soaps are escapism, and I understand they're family shows. But the fact that they're in people's homes four or five times a week, they have a huge opportunity to create awareness around these social issues. ""And soaps reflect real life and issues in society, so I commend them for highlighting something like this. I know they can be tough to watch, but I think it's so important and necessary."" A spokesman for the show said viewers would see the ""wide reaching ramifications of knife crime... as everyone attempts to comprehend the gravity of what has happened on their doorstep"". Kinsella isn't able to reveal specific plot details, but says ""it's going to be a tough, hard-hitting storyline"". She says: ""I'm aware that it will be quite upsetting, but the EastEnders team were wonderful, they were very brave in tackling this issue, they didn't just make it a short storyline, they're dedicating quite a bit of time to it. Shaheen Jafargholi plays Shakil Kazemi ""They're not just going to be focusing on the attack, but also the repercussions. It's also about how it affects family, friends, and the community. I think it's going to reach a lot of people's hearts and make them look at knife crime in a way that they hadn't."" Brooke says she's been consulted on the storyline as it's been written, with the EastEnders team sending over scripts for her to look at in order to make sure what's on screen is a ""true reflection"" of what happens to a family when such a tragedy takes place. Kinsella started the Ben Kinsella Trust to educate young people on the dangers of carrying knives after her brother was fatally stabbed. In EastEnders, her character was introduced as a prostitute who became friends with Zoe Slater (played by Michelle Ryan) and was taken in by the Slater family.

"The UK prime minister welcomed a ""new dynamic"" in the talks EU leaders have approved guidelines for the negotiation of future relations with the UK after Brexit. The text,externalon trade, security and other issues was agreed in ""less than half a minute"", clearing the way for the next phase of Brexit talks to get under way. The UK is due to leave in March 2019 and negotiators have said they want a deal in place by the end of the year. Prime Minister Theresa May said she believed there was a new ""spirit of co-operation and opportunity"". The formal adoption of the guidelines, although widely expected, is seen as another key step as the Brexit process gathers momentum. The guidelines give chief negotiator Michel Barnier the mandate to talk directly to the UK about the future relationship with a view to reaching a broad political agreement by October to allow the EU and UK parliaments time to consider it. Pienaar: So can May now survive Brexit course? Reality Check: What have EU leaders agreed on Brexit? Labour frontbencher backs second EU vote European Council President Donald Tusk said the ""positive momentum"" should be used to settle outstanding issues like avoiding a hard border in Northern Ireland. EU leaders will decide in June whether the ""Irish question"" has been resolved and will look into a ""common declaration on our future"", he added. Mrs May, who was not present when her colleagues met to discuss Brexit, said she believed there was a ""new dynamic"" in the negotiations. ""I believe we are approaching this with a spirit of co-operation, a spirit of opportunity for the future as well, and we will now be sitting down and determining those workable solutions for Northern Ireland, but also for our future security partnership and economic partnership,"" she said. ""I believe it is in the best interest of both the UK and the EU that we get a deal that actually is in the interests of both."" By the BBC's Europe reporter Adam Fleming EU leaders have given their chief negotiator Michel Barnier a mandate to talk about trade While welcoming the progress so far, there is a reminder that there is no legal certainty, including over the transition deal, until the whole agreement is ratified. Last-minute wrangling by Spain has led to the inclusion of a reference to the EU's position on Gibraltar. It says that Spain and the UK have to reach a separate deal over it. The EU's big offer is a close future relationship based on a free trade agreement with no tariffs on goods and a close partnership on security and defence, both of which the UK wants. The UK's ""red lines"" will limit the closeness of the future relationship. A sentence says Brexit will cause economic consequences for both sides, which was tweaked to specify the UK would be the worse off. What has been dubbed the ""evolution clause"" indicates that the EU will reconsider its offer to Britain if the UK government compromises on its red lines, such as by remaining in the customs union. The EU fears competition from the UK and is demanding a ""level playing field"" between the two - including ways to prevent potential undercutting on tax, environmental and labour standards. While not directly mentioning financial services, the EU says it will jealously guard its financial stability. The remaining 27 leaders have also endorsed an agreement reached earlier this week on a 21-month transition period between March 2019, when the UK officially leaves, and the end of 2020. During that period, the UK will be able to negotiate, sign and ratify its own trade deals, while EU citizens arriving in the UK will enjoy the same rights and guarantees as those who arrive before Brexit. A solution to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland has yet to be agreed, with the EU insisting on a ""backstop"" option of Northern Ireland, in effect, remaining in the customs union. Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said he wanted an agreement that keeps the UK ""as close as possible"" to the EU in order to protect trade and jobs. But Labour, which supports staying in the customs union, said the UK and EU were a ""very long way away"" from achieving this at the moment and the PM needed to ""finally drop her reckless red lines"". Meanwhile, EU leaders are calling for reciprocal access to UK fishing waters and stocks to be maintained after the end of the transition period. Asked whether he thought the UK would agree to this, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker told BBC Scotland this was the EU's ""working basis"". ""We are in ongoing discussions with the UK - to try and bring them (to) where we are and they are trying to bring us (to) where they are,"" he said. The UK has already agreed to abide by the rules of the Common Fisheries Policy during the transition, sparking anger among fishing groups which want full sovereignty over UK waters upon Brexit.

"Ed Sheeran made a Comic Relief film in Liberia last year Sport Relief isn't using appeal films showing stars visiting developing countries after complaints that they were akin to ""poverty tourism"". Sport Relief, which is on TV on the BBC on Friday, takes place every other year, alternating with Red Nose Day. The Comic Relief charity runs both events and said most of its films would just feature people who live in those countries speaking for themselves. MP David Lammy had said they portrayed Africans as ""victims to be pitied"". The Sport Relief and Red Nose Day telethons usually feature clips of well-known personalities meeting people in places where the charity works, including Africa. But Comic Relief chief executive Liz Warner said: ""This year, we are putting people at the heart of the films. ""We haven't sent celebrities, for the night of TV, to Africa. People are telling their stories in their own voices, and we are using local heroes."" A 2017 Red Nose Day film fronted by Ed Sheeran, about street children in Liberia, was named the ""most offensive"" campaign last year by a fundraising pressure group. In it, the singer was seen meeting a young boy before offering to pay for a hotel for him and his friends.The Radi-Aid awards,externalsaid it was almost ""poverty tourism"". Allow YouTube content?

Sport Relief, which aims to raise millions for disadvantaged people in the UK and around the world, is a week-long event this year, culminating in the live broadcast on Friday night. The move comes after David Lammy made a film for BBC Two's Daily Politics, saying Comic Relief had ""tattooed images of poverty in Africa to our national psyche"" - and was not showing the full reality of life on the continent. ""Sports Relief should be helping to establish the people of Africa as equals to be respected, not as victims to be pitied,"" he said. ""So, rather than getting celebrities to act as tour guides, why not get Africans to talk for themselves about the continent and the problems that they know?"" Lammy has agreed to talk to Comic Relief - and has been invited to make a film for them himself. He said on Friday: ""I am pleased that Comic Relief has listened to concerns that I have raised and will be making changes to their output. ""I hope that the films they make will respect and empower African people and amplify their voices instead of patronising them. This represents a step in the right direction and some progress.""

"Creditors of restaurant group Prezzo have backed a restructuring plan that will see it close 94 outlets - about a third of the chain. It is estimated the move could lead to 500 job losses. The chain, which is owned by private equity firm TPG Capital, employs about 4,500 people. The 94 closures include restaurants under the Prezzo, Mexico and Cleaver brands and all 33 Chimichanga sites . Under the rescue plan, rents will be cut by between 25% and 50% at 57 sites. The closures and rent reductions aim to repair the group's financial position and allow it to continue trading. The deal was struck under a restructuring arrangement know as a company voluntary arrangement (CVA) - a step short of going into administration. Whatâs eating the restaurant trade? Jamie Oliver closes flagship restaurant Six reasons behind the High Street crisis Jon Hendry-Pickup, chief executive of Prezzo, thanked the company's creditors and landlords for their support. He said: ""While we continue to be profitable, the pressures on our industry have been well documented. Despite this being a tough decision, the support given today by our creditors shows that they believe we have the right approach to transforming Prezzo in the eyes of teams, customers and stakeholders."" This video can not be played Trouble for High Street restaurants The restaurants identified for closure are likely to close in April and May. Prezzo said that staff would be made aware of the exact dates as soon as they had been confirmed. Prezzo was bought by TPG in 2014 for just over Â£300m. It is the latest of a number of restaurant chains to run into difficulties. Burger chain Byron and Jamie's Italian have both had to undergo similar restructurings this year, agreeing rescue plans with their lenders and landlords, and closing restaurants. The wider retail market is also suffering. The UK arm oftoy retailer Toys R Usandelectronics chain Maplinboth recently collapsed into administration. Businesses on the High Street are facing a tough environment.  Wage growth has not kept up with inflation, which has hit the spending power of shoppers. Business costs such as the National Living Wage are going up, and business rates will rise for many firms in April. Companies are also facing increasing competition from online retailers.

"This video can not be played Five lifestyle changes which could help people avoid cancer Being overweight or obese is a growing cause of cancer in the UK while cases caused by smoking are falling, according to a large study. Cancer Research UK found more than a third of all cases of cancer were avoidable - some 135,000. The charity also found that excess weight now caused 6.3% of all cancer cases - up from 5.5% in 2011 - while smoking as a cause had declined. It said more action was needed to tackle the ""health threat"" of obesity. Millennials 'set to be fattest generation' World's children rapidly turning obese Cancer Research UK found the country with the greatest proportion of preventable causes of cancer was Scotland with 41.5%, followed by Northern Ireland on 38%, Wales on 37.8%, and England on 37.3%. Across the UK, smoking remained by far the leading cause of preventable cancer, although it dropped from 19.4% in 2011 to 15.1%. Second was beingoverweight or obese,external, and third was exposure to UV radiation from the sun and sunbeds. The standard way of diagnosing if someone is obese is bycalculating their body mass index(BMI). It measures whether you're a healthy weight for your height. A BMI of more than 25 means you're overweight and a BMI of more than 30 means you're classified as obese, although there are some exceptions. Janet Boak was told being obese contributed to her risk of getting cancer Janet Boak, from Carlisle, was diagnosed with womb cancer at 51, after she noticed spots of blood four years after her menopause. She had a full hysterectomy, which successfully removed the cancer. It was during a subsequent check-up that she was told being obese had contributed to her risk of getting cancer. At the time, she was nearly 20 stone. ""I felt like I was responsible for my own downfall,"" Janet, 55, said. ""It stuck in my gut a bit, thinking I could maybe not have been in this position had I sorted my lifestyle out."" Janet, a grandmother, has since lost nearly seven stone after she cut down on sugar, started cooking healthier meals from fresh ingredients and became more active. Cancer Research UK found overexposure to UV radiation caused about 13,600 cases of melanoma skin cancer a year - or 3.8% of all cancer cases. Other preventable causes of cancer included drinking alcohol and eating too little fibre, it said. However, overall the analysis found the proportion of preventable cases of cancer had fallen - from 42.7% in 2011 to 37.7%. Drinking alcohol was estimated to have caused 3.3% of cancers in the UK Cancer Research UK said the figures showed smoking prevention strategies were working, but more work was needed to tackle the growing problem of obesity. Prof Linda Bauld, Cancer Research UK's prevention expert, said: ""Obesity is a huge health threat right now, and it will only get worse if nothing is done. ""The UK government must build on the successes of smoking prevention to reduce the number of weight-related cancers. ""Banning junk food TV adverts before the 21:00 GMT watershed is an important part of the comprehensive approach needed."" Prof Mel Greaves, a cancer biologist at the Institute of Cancer Research, in London, said the study was an ""endorsement"" of the idea that many cancers were potentially preventable. But he said the idea that obesity itself or eating too little fibre ""causes"" cancer was ""somewhat simplistic"" and still needed to be explored further. ""If obesity could be avoided, the impact on cancer rates is uncertain - but they would almost certainly decline significantly,"" Prof Greaves said. ""Given the currently high rates of obesity in young people, this represents (like cigarette smoking) a major societal challenge beyond the bounds of the medical arena.""

"About 75 whales have already died, Western Australia authorities say About 150 whales have become stranded on a beach in Australia, prompting a major rescue effort. The animals were spotted by a fisherman at Hamelin Bay, about 300km (180 miles) south of Perth, early on Friday. About half of the whales were already dead, according to authorities in Western Australian (WA). Conservation officials said they were trying to save the surviving animals on the beach. ""The strength of the animals and the windy and possibly wet weather conditions will affect when and where we attempt to move them out to sea,"" said Jeremy Chick, from the Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions. Officials said the stranding involved two species - short-finned and long-finned pilot whales. It is not known why the whales became stranded The Australian Broadcasting Corporation reported that dozens of rescuers were at the beach. Authorities have also issued a shark alert, warning people to stay away from the area. ""It is possible the dead and dying animals will act as an attractant, which could lead to sharks coming close into shore along this stretch of coast,"" the state's fisheries department said in a statement. Scientists do not know exactly what causes whales to beach themselves. Experts have said stranding can occur when whales are sick, injured, or make navigational errors, particularly along gentle sloping beaches. Are whales attempting suicide when they beach themselves? Why a New Zealand beach strands so many whales Sometimes beached animals can send out distress signals that attract other whales to become stranded. In 1996, about 320 long-finned whales became beached in Western Australia's largest stranding. This video can not be played Can dolphins reveal why whales strand?

Ball cycled more than 350 miles from her home town to where she lives now The charity plans to enlist more celebrities to speak about issues that are close to their hearts - such as withZoe Ball's cycling challenge to raise awareness of male mental health. Friday's Sport Relief will include a film about street children in Uganda. It will be introduced by Rio Ferdinand, but he will not appear in the clip himself. Instead, it will feature the children and a charity worker. Stars will appear in films about the UK, though, with John Bishop fronting a clip about a project near his home in the north-west of England. This video can not be played David Lammy says African people are ""equals to be respected, not as victims to be pitied"". Sport Relief, which aims to raise millions for disadvantaged people in the UK and around the world, is a week-long event this year, culminating in the live broadcast on Friday night. The move comes after David Lammy made a film for BBC Two's Daily Politics, saying Comic Relief had ""tattooed images of poverty in Africa to our national psyche"" - and was not showing the full reality of life on the continent. ""Sports Relief should be helping to establish the people of Africa as equals to be respected, not as victims to be pitied,"" he said. ""So, rather than getting celebrities to act as tour guides, why not get Africans to talk for themselves about the continent and the problems that they know?"" Lammy has agreed to talk to Comic Relief - and has been invited to make a film for them himself. He said on Friday: ""I am pleased that Comic Relief has listened to concerns that I have raised and will be making changes to their output. ""I hope that the films they make will respect and empower African people and amplify their voices instead of patronising them. This represents a step in the right direction and some progress.""

"Asian shares have been hit by fears that US President Donald Trump's plan for tariffs on up to $60bn of Chinese products could trigger a trade war. Japan's Nikkei 225 index fell 4.5% and the Shanghai Composite fell 3.6%. China responded to news of the planned tariffs by saying that while it did not want a trade war, it was ""absolutely not afraid"" of one. Mr Trump's proposed tariffs are a response to allegations of intellectual property theft by China. The US launched a complaint against China at the World Trade Organization (WTO) on Friday. Its statement said: ""China appears to be breaking WTO rules by denying foreign patent holders, including US companies, basic patent rights to stop a Chinese entity from using the technology after a licensing contract ends."" ""China also appears to be breaking WTO rules by imposing mandatory adverse contract terms that discriminate against and are less favourable for imported foreign technology."" Trump: Tariffs on $60bn in Chinese goods US exempts EU from steel tariffs Reality Check: Is Trump right about US trade deficit? How a trade war might affect you Beijing said it firmly opposed the planned tariffs but China's ministry of commerce said it was ""confident and capable of meeting any challenge"". ""China will not sit idly by its own legitimate rights and interests. We are fully prepared to defend our legitimate interests,"" the ministry said. But it said it hoped the US would not drag bilateral economic and trade relations into danger. Fears of a trade war pushed Asian stock markets down sharply.China's Shanghai Composite Indexclosed down 3.6% whileHong Kong's Hang Seng indexended 2.5% lower. ""Equity markets have sold-off heavily this morning as investors are fearful we are entering a trade war,"" said David Maddon, market analyst at CMC Markets UK. ""Traders don't like the look of the political landscape, and they are seeking safe-haven assets."" China is a huge consumer of pork and pork products Earlier on Friday, China announced its own set of proposed tariffs worth $3bn. Beijing said these were in response toUS tariffs on steel and aluminium imports announced by Mr Trump earlier this month. The US tariffs on steel and aluminium imports come into effect this week. China's commerce ministry said it was planning two steps of retaliatory action: a 15% tariff on 120 goods worth almost $1bn - including fresh fruit, nuts and wine a 25% tariff on eight goods worth nearly $2bn - including pork and aluminium scrap. The US imports billions more goods from China each year than it exports, creating a deficit of about $375bn last year  -  a figures which Mr Trump has railed against. The president said on Thursday he had asked China to cut that deficit by $100bn ""immediately"". Last August, Mr Trump ordered an investigation into Chinese policies and his proposed tariffs reflect the outcome of that probe. The White House said the investigation found a range of ""unfair"" practices in China, including restrictions on foreign ownership that pressured foreign companies into transferring technology. The review also found evidence that China imposes unfair terms on US companies; steers investments in the US to strategic industries; and conducts and supports cyber attacks. Trump: Political heir to Abe Lincoln? The problem facing Trump's China probe EU and six other countries exempted from US metals tariffs The White House said it had a list of more than 1,000 products that could be targeted by tariffs of 25%. Businesses will have the opportunity to comment before the final list goes into effect. The US is also exploring ways to limit Chinese investment in the US. It says it will bring any matter it thinks is unfair to the WTO - as it is doing in the case of intellectual property. US officials had acknowledged the possibility of retaliation from China, but said the Asian giant ultimately had more to lose. If imposed as described, the US tariffs could lead to higher costs for consumers, while China's retaliation would hit key sectors of the US economy including agriculture and aerospace, analysts say. China is one of the biggest buyers of US soybeans China was the third largest market for US exports in 2016 and among the biggest buyers of American corn, pork and aircraft. China is also the world's biggest consumer of soybeans and consumes about one third of the US crop. But in news which will come as a relief to US farmers, Friday's announcement did not include the soybeans. Critics of Mr Trump's policies dismiss worries about the trade deficit, saying the exchange benefits both sides. However, there is growing bipartisan concern in America about China's state-led economy and there is a worry that China is seeking technology that could be deployed for military purposes. Mr Trump's America First policy remains popular with large sections of the US public. However, trade watchers in Asia says China's retaliation will no doubt be carefully targeted to hit key Trump-supporting areas of the US. ""The Chinese have been developing their list for more than a year and they are very good,"" said Deborah Elms, executive director of the Asian Trade Centre in Singapore. ""If things get very nasty, they can also make life very difficult for US companies doing business in China.  It's going to be very interesting.""

"There was a time, not so long ago, when calculators were spurned as the handmaid of the lazy maths student. But according to the latest research, far from hindering young maths pupils, these little magic boxes actually aid them with their arithmetic skills. Academics for the Education Endowment Foundation also found that when taught properly, calculators can help students become better at problem solving. Calculators are most useful, they said, when woven into teaching materials. Ministers banned the use of calculators in national maths tests for 11-year-olds in England from 2014. Announcing the move in 2012,the then Education and Childcare Minister Elizabeth Truss said this would ""reduce the dependency on them in the classroom for the most basic sums"". She added: ""All young children should be confident with methods of addition, subtraction, times tables and division before they pick up the calculator to work out more complex sums."" The move followed a government review of calculator use in primary schools. Eddie Woo: The maths teacher who became an unlikely star The teenage maths genius from Lebanon Maths teachers hit out at 'extraordinary' funding decision Sir Kevan Collins, chief executive of EEF, which is an education charity, said: ""It's often said that calculators can harm students' arithmetic skills. ""What this review finds is that they can actually boost pupils' fluency and understanding of maths - but that to do so, teachers should ensure they are used in a considered and thoughtful way, particularly with younger students."" But, in this latest research, academics quoted a paper which showed pupils who had used calculators systematically throughout primary school had a greater understanding of and fluency with arithmetic. However, the report added that primary school pupils should use calculators regularly but not every day. And it said secondary school students should be allowed more frequent access to calculators so they can make decisions about when and when not to use them. One of the report authors, Prof Jeremy Hodgen, chairman of Mathematics Education at University College London, said: ""It's really important that kids use calculators amongst other methods."" He suggested they were valuable in checking calculations are right and mean that pupils can tackle tricky numbers. He said: ""Employers really value numeracy, but they don't want people who can just recite their times tables, they want someone who can work out something in the real world. ""No-one in the real world would think of calculating 4,271.36 times 289.67 in their heads. ""But before they use a calculator they should know that the answer is about 1.2 million, so that if they get an answer which is about 123,000 they have made a mis-key error."" Chris McGovern, chairman of the Campaign for Real Education, said there was a place for calculators in schools because they were a useful tool. But he warned: ""The problem is that over-reliance on calculators means there are many youngsters who leave school without being able to work out mental maths in their head. ""I think it's necessary that children learn their times tables without relying on calculators to give them the answer,"" he said. A Department for Education spokesperson said: ""Calculators can be an important tool when being taught maths but this must not be at the expense of children mastering the fundamentals of mental arithmetic and calculation - a point which the EEF acknowledges."" It added that standards were rising in primary school, that it was investing Â£74m in the Teaching for Mastery maths programme. It is also trialling a new online times table check to increase the number of children mastering the basics of mathematics. The maths teacher who became an online star.

"This video can not be played The war of words between the UK and Russia The EU has recalled its ambassador to Moscow after leaders agreed it was ""highly likely"" Russia was responsible for a nerve agent attack in the UK. The European Council of EU leaders said there was ""no plausible alternative"". Moscow denies responsibility for the attack on an ex-spy and his daughter and said the EU was following an ""anti-Russian campaign launched by London"". Meanwhile, British diplomats expelled from Russia have left the embassy in Moscow ahead of Russia's deadline. Russia decided to expel the British diplomatsin a tit-for-tat response to the UK's expulsion of 23 of its diplomats. Former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia remain in a critical but stable condition after the attack on 4 March. Laura Kuenssberg: Small words, big difference Russian spy: What we know so far EU summit moves from Russia to Brexit UK Prime Minister Theresa May welcomed the EU support, saying that it was right ""we are standing together"" as the threat posed by Russia ""respects no borders and it is a threat to our values"". The EU said its ambassador to Russia, German Markus Ederer, was recalled ""for consultations"" and was expected in Brussels over the weekend. The European Council statement added: ""We stand in unqualified solidarity with the United Kingdom in the face of this grave challenge to our shared security."" A convoy of vehicles leaves the British Embassy in Moscow ahead of Russia's deadline for 23 UK diplomats to leave the country In response, Russia's foreign ministry said: ""We regret that the EU chose to follow another anti-Russian campaign launched by London and its allies from across the ocean, with the obvious purpose of creating yet another obstacle to normalising the situation on the European continent."" Mrs May briefed her counterparts on Thursday on the poisoning of the Skripals, who were found unconscious on a bench in Salisbury. The prime minister set out the evidence the UK has against Russia - including the positive identification of the chemical used as a type of Novichok nerve agent and the knowledge that Russia has produced this agent within the last 10 years. Asked if she had relied on UK intelligence information to convince EU allies, Mrs May said the UK had been sharing ""throughout"" the investigation ""what intelligence we can share with our colleagues"". She said: ""What is crucial is that there was recognition around the table about the threat that Russia poses."" By Laura Kuenssberg, BBC political editor It might not sound much, but a few small words can make a big difference. The president of the European Council has used the prime minister's language about the Salisbury attack, accepting and agreeing with the British verdict that there is no other ""plausible"" explanation for what happened. That is a small, but significantly different, tone to the statement a few days ago. EU ministers would only say: ""The European Union takes extremely seriously the UK government's assessment that it is highly likely that the Russian Federation is responsible."" The sentiment then was, OK, it might have been them - but you haven't convinced us yet. Read more from Laura This video can not be played Theresa May said, after talks, that it was ""right that we stand together"" Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said he supported the EU's position ""very strongly"" and Ireland could expel Russian officials if they were shown to be acting as intelligence agents. He said there would be a security assessment in the coming days with a decision as early as next week. Lithuania, Czech Republic and Latvia have also said they were considering expelling suspected Russian spies from their countries. But Greek PM Alexis Tsipras said that while he wanted to ""express solidarity"" with Britain, ""we also need to be responsible on that issue"". The European Union has a network of 140 delegations around the world which represent the EU abroad. The EU nominates ambassadors to those embassies. They play a key role in presenting, explaining and implementing the EU's foreign policies to their host country. The current EU ambassador to Russia is German diplomat Markus Ederer, who has previously been responsible for China and Mongolia.

"This video can not be played Police have surrounded the French supermarket, as the BBC's Lucy Williamson reports A gunman is believed to have killed at least two people during a hostage-taking at a supermarket in TrÃ¨bes, southern France. An operation involving elite police is continuing at the Super U shop, where others were wounded. Reports say the gunman, who remains in the supermarket, pledged allegiance to the Islamic State group. Earlier, a policeman was shot and wounded while jogging with colleagues in Carcassonne, a 15-minute drive away. He was shot in the shoulder by the same suspect involved in the supermarket hostage-taking but is not critically injured, Yves Lefebvre, secretary-general of the SGP Police-FO union told the Associated Press. TrÃ¨bes Mayor Eric Menassi told BFM TV that the gunman was now alone in the shop with one police officer, after other hostages were freed. The suspect is said to be heavily armed and asking for the release of Salah Abdeslam, the most important surviving suspect in the 13 November 2015 Paris attacks, which killed 130 people. Reports say the suspect is known to French intelligence services and that his mother is at the scene. Five things about Paris attacks suspect Salah Abdeslam A security source told French news agency AFP that most employees and customers at the supermarket ""managed to flee"".

"This video can not be played Russian ambassador Alexander Yakovenko: Johnson's comments ""totally irresponsible"" UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson's likening of Russia's World Cup to Hitler's 1936 Berlin Olympics has been branded ""totally irresponsible"" by the Russian ambassador in London. Alexander Yakovenko said ""nobody had the right"" to compare Russia - which lost 25 million lives in World War Two - with Nazi Germany. He said it was an insult to British war veterans from the Arctic convoys. Mr Johnson told the BBC: ""I stick by, completely, what I said."" Prime Minister Theresa May has said the material used in the attack had been identified as being part of a group of nerve agents developed by Russia, known as Novichok. She will later tell an EU summit the poisoning of Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia shows Moscow has no respect for international law. Putin 'will use Cup like Hitler's Olympics' May warns EU of 'Russian aggression' Russian spy: What we know so far The pair remain in a critical condition in hospital after they were found unconscious on a bench on 4 March. Russia says the UK had ""no proof"" it carried out the attack. Mr Johnson made his initial comment at a Foreign Affairs Select Committee meeting on Wednesday. The foreign secretary agreed with the comparison made by Labour MP Ian Austin, adding: ""Your characterisation of what is going to happen in Moscow in the World Cup, in all the venues, yes, I think the comparison with 1936 is certainly right. ""I think it is an emetic prospect frankly to think of [Russian President Vladimir] Putin glorying in this sporting event."" Speaking at the Russian Embassy in London on Thursday Mr Yakovenko said Moscow considered the foreign secretary's comments ""unacceptable and totally irresponsible"". ""The British government is free to make a decision about its participation in the World Cup,"" he said. ""But nobody has the right to insult the Russian people - who defeated Nazism and lost most than 25 million people - by comparing our country to Nazi Germany. ""That goes beyond common sense. And we do not think British war veterans - including those of the Arctic convoys [which shipped four million tonnes of armaments and essential supplies to the Soviet Union during World War Two] - would share this opinion."" The Soviet Union's war dead included Ukrainians, Belarusians, Kazakhs and citizens of other non-Russian Federation countries. Mr Johnson has stuck by his comments made at the select committee on Wednesday Speaking later, on a visit to Derby, Mr Johnson said he stuck by what he said ""completely"". He said: ""We don't want to escalate this any further. What we want is some way in which they will at least accept that the Russian state must have had some role in this. ""We want to see the safety of UK people going to the World Cup, that's the most important thing, [but] I think that the idea of Vladimir Putin glorying in a great sporting occasion and receiving the adulation of international figures is, as I said, emetic. ""So I stick by completely what I said."" Mr Yakovenko's response came as he gave a statement on Russia's latest position regarding the Salisbury attack. He criticised the British government for refusing to share information and provide the Russian government with a sample of the nerve agent. He said Mrs May had ""built the official position on assumptions"", adding: ""Britain has, without any evidence, blamed Russia of poisoning of three people [the Skripals and Det Sgt Nick Bailey who was part of the initial response to the incident] and continues to refuse to cooperate. ""We cannot accept that."" But Mrs May will stick with her conclusion and tell EU heads of state that although the attempted assassination of the Skripals took place on UK soil, the Russian threat does not respect borders and places all European nations at risk.

"Dave Smith says campaigners have been vindicated Scotland Yard has admitted Special Branch officers passed information to a controversial network that blacklisted construction workers. It follows a six-year battle to find out if the Metropolitan Police supplied the intelligence on trade unionists. The force says its investigation had ""proven"" the allegation, which will be investigated by a public inquiry. Workers who say they were unfairly barred from jobs have already received millions of pounds in compensation. In 2016, the union Unite reached a settlement with construction firms that resulted in 256 workers sharing more than Â£10m in compensation. At the heart of the claims, which were made by hundreds of workers, was evidence that firms accesseda ""blacklist"" that logged workers' trade union activities. The list was used by dozens of construction firms to vet those applying for work on building sites. When the files were found to contain details of individual's political activities, the workers demanded that Scotland Yard disclose whether undercover police had colluded in supplying intelligence. The blacklisting scandal came to light in 2009 following a raid by the information commissioner's office on an organisation called the Consulting Association It uncovered a list of more than 3,000 workers - which in some instances also included details of personal relationships and their political activity as well as their trade union links on building sites Eight firms which used the list were sued by the workers: Carillion, Balfour Beatty, Costain, Kier, Laing O'Rourke, Sir Robert McAlpine, Skanska UK and Vinci The eight firms issued an unreserved apology for their part in the system It's thought that more than 700 workers shared Â£75m in settlement compensation - with many others having earlier settled for smaller amounts In a letter to the workers' lawyers, Deputy Assistant Commissioner Richard Martin said the findings of the Metropolitan Police's internal investigation, completed two years ago, were so sensitive that they were sent directly to the then commissioner. The letter states: ""Allegation: Police, including Special Branches, supplied information that appeared on the Blacklist, funded by the country's major construction firms. ""The report concludes that, on the balance of probabilities, the allegation that the police or Special Branches supplied information is 'proven'. ""Material revealed a potentially improper flow of information from Special Branch to external organisations, which ultimately appeared on the blacklist."" Dave Smith, of the Blacklist Support Group, says a 36-page file on him - disclosed to him during the original investigation by the information commissioner - included details of his trade union work and information that appeared to have come from undercover monitoring of his political campaigning. ""When we first talked about police collusion in blacklisting, people thought we were conspiracy theorists,"" he said. ""We were told, things like that don't happen here. With this admission from the Met Police, our quest for the truth has been vindicated."" Undercover policing inquiry: Chairman urged to quit Can the undercover police inquiry get to the truth? Evidence given to Parliament suggested that one undercover officer who infiltrated Mr Smith's union was  Mark ""Cassidy"" Jenner, a member of Scotland Yard's now disbanded Special Demonstration Squad (SDS). The SDS's activities are at the heart of the long-delayed public inquiry into alleged abuses by undercover police. While Scotland Yard's letter says there is no evidence that SDS officers passed information to the blacklist network, a separate document published by the inquiry has revealed the existence of a unit called the ""Industrial Intelligence Section,external"". In a statement, Scotland Yard said it had apologised for the delay in releasing the outcome of its blacklist the investigation. ""Allegations about police involvement with the 'Blacklist' will be fully explored during the Undercover Policing Public Inquiry,"" it said. ""At this stage the MPS will await the conclusions of the UCPI before considering what steps should be taken next.""

"Katie Brennan says she should face the same penalty as a male player The captain of an Australian rules football team has launched a high-profile gender discrimination complaint after she was banned from playing in her league's biggest match. Katie Brennan was suspended from the Australian Football League Women's (AFLW) over a rough tackle. A similar offence in the men's league would attract a fine, not a suspension. Brennan has taken her case to the Australian Human Rights Commission. League officials have denied sexism. Australian rules football is a contact sport that involves two teams of 18 people who use their feet or hands to move an oval-shaped ball. Players tackle by wrapping their arms around an opponent and dragging them to the ground. Brennan's tackle was deemed illegal because her opponent's head hit the ground - a rule designed to prevent concussion. The opponent appeared shaken but continued playing. Brennan tackles a player legally to the ground during a match in 2015 A tribunal ruled that Brennan had used excessive force, and banned her from leading the Western Bulldogs in the AFLW Grand Final on Saturday. Brennan has asserted that her suspension is a ""fundamental breach"" of Australia's Sex Discrimination Act. She argues that AFL rules stipulate a lesser penalty in the men's game, citing incidents involving players Jack Redden and Ben Howlett last year. The women's sport captivating Australia Transgender first for Australian football ""I believe my tackle on [opponent] Harriet Cordner was reasonable and I strongly disagree with the guilty finding,"" she said in a statement on Friday. ""It is even more troubling to know that if I was a man playing in the AFL and was reported for the identical tackle, I would not have been suspended and I would be playing in a grand final tomorrow.""

""It will definitely be looked at, whether there's change is a different issue. I think there's a fair question to be asked there,"" he said. Western Bulldogs chief executive Ameet Bains said: ""We share Katie's view that her suspension was wrong and we will fully support her challenging the AFL rules on the basis of gender discrimination.""

"John Bolton is to be Mr Trump's third national security adviser President Donald Trump is replacing US National Security Adviser HR McMaster with Bush-era defence hawk and former United Nations ambassador John Bolton. Mr Trump tweeted to thank Gen McMaster, saying he had done an ""outstanding job & will always remain my friend"". Mr Bolton, who has backed attacking North Korea and Iran, told Fox News his job would be to ensure the president has ""the full range of options"". He becomes Mr Trump's third national security chief in 14 months. Gen McMaster is the latest high-profile departure from the White House. Last week, Mr Trump fired Secretary of State Rex Tillerson by a tweet, replacing him with former CIA Director Mike Pompeo. Why did Trump dump his security adviser? The White House revolving door Five things Bolton believes Mr Bolton's appointment does not require US Senate confirmation. He will take the job on 9 April. The National Security Adviser is the key counsellor to the president on national security and foreign policy issues, and acts as a conduit for policy proposals coming from various government departments, including defence and state.

Mr Bolton, 69, has been a foreign policy hawk in Republican circles for decades, having served in the administrations of Ronald Reagan, George HW Bush and George W Bush. The second Bush appointed him as US envoy to the UN, during which time diplomats privately criticised Mr Bolton's style as abrasive. A strident neo-conservative, Mr Bolton helped build the case that Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction, which turned out to be wrong. Known for his walrus moustache, Mr Bolton does not appear to have greatly moderated his views since his last spell in government. He stands by the invasion of Iraq and has advocated in newspaper op-eds using military force against North Korea and Iran. This video can not be played US National Security Adviser HR McMaster is the latest victim of the President's line up changes. Analysis by BBC North America reporter Anthony Zurcher Earlier this month, Donald Trump tweeted: ""I still have some people that I want to change"". He wasn't kidding. Since then chief economic adviser Gary Cohn, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, personal lawyer John Dowd and now National Security Adviser HR McMaster have headed to (or been shown) the exits. One explanation is that the president feels more comfortable in his job - and more willing to challenge the advice given him by his closest aides. He has chafed at the perception that he is being ""handled"" by those around him, and is installing men who agree to action, instead of preaching caution. When it comes to Iran, Mr Bolton and the president are on the same page. Coupled with Mr Tillerson's exit, the US is heading toward a much more confrontational relationship with the Islamic Republic. In other ways, however, the former UN ambassador is an unusual choice. Mr Trump frequently has called the Iraq war a colossal mistake - the same war that Mr Bolton enthusiastically promoted during his time in the George W Bush administration. Candidate Trump regularly espoused non-interventionism. Mr Bolton is a hawk's hawk. Now that hawk has a perch in the Oval Office. Bush-era war hawk makes comeback This video can not be played Trump's unprecedented staff turnover rate In the US Republican Senator Lindsay Graham described the appointment as ""good news for America's allies and bad news for America's enemies"" Democrat Senator Chris Coons said Mr Bolton's stance on Iran and North Korea was ""overly aggressive at best and downright dangerous at worst"". Abraham Denmark, a senior defence official in the Obama administration, said: ""Bolton has long been an advocate for pre-emptive military action against North Korea, and his appointment as national security adviser is a strong signal that President Trump remains open to these options"" Globally Iran's Guardian Council called Mr Bolton a ""supporter of terrorists"", focusing on past statements of support forthe Mujahideen-e Khalq (MEK), an exiled opposition group that backs the overthrow of the Islamic Republic North Korea has yet to react but the government there once called John Bolton ""human scum"" ""This is worrisome news,"" the head of the national defence committee of South Korea's parliament told Reuters news agency, expressing fears that US-North Korea talks could be scuppered In a brief statement on Thursday, Gen McMaster thanked President Trump for appointing him and said he was applying to retire from the US Army later this year. The 55-year-old three-star general is leaving after just over a year as national security adviser. The president had reportedly found Gen McMaster's briefings to be grating. He was also described as aggressive and prone to lecture. The White House said Mr Trump and Gen McMaster had ""mutually agreed"" that he would leave. He had been rumoured for weeks to be on his way out. HR McMaster's briefings reportedly grated on the president Gen McMaster's departure came a day after it was leaked that Mr Trump was advised this week in briefing documents not to congratulate Russian President Vladimir Putin on his recent re-election, but did it anyway. Gen McMaster replaced Lt Gen Michael Flynn, who was fired after less than a month in the job for misleading the White House about his contacts with the Russian ambassador.

AFL chief executive Gillon McLachlan said it was unfair to call Brennan's case an example of sexism. ""I guess I would say that in different competitions, we have different rules,"" he said on Melbourne radio station 3AW. However, he said the current rules would be reviewed. ""It will definitely be looked at, whether there's change is a different issue. I think there's a fair question to be asked there,"" he said. Western Bulldogs chief executive Ameet Bains said: ""We share Katie's view that her suspension was wrong and we will fully support her challenging the AFL rules on the basis of gender discrimination."" Brennan will seek to overturn her suspension through the Australian Human Rights Commission - an independent statutory body that is government-funded.The commission resolves matters through conciliation,external. There will be no outcome before Saturday, but Brennan said her main aim was to make rules consistent between AFL and AFLW.

"MPs have called for tougher measures to protect passengers and local communities before plans to expand Heathrow Airport are approved. The Transport Committee said there should be a night flight ban of seven hours. The MPs also want further evidence that landing charges will not be raised to pay for a third runway. If these and other concerns are addressed, the MPs said Parliament should approve Heathrow expansion. A Department for Transport spokeswoman said: ""Expansion will only proceed if it meets strict environmental obligations and offers a world-class package of compensation and mitigations for local communities."" The airport currently does not have a ban on night flights. There is currently a government proposal for a night flight ban of six-and-a-half hours. Heathrow does, though, have restrictions on the number of take-offs and landings it is allowed between the night hours of 11:30 and 06:00. It can only make 5,800 take-offs and landings a year during these times, with more allowed in winter than summer. The report says the government should press ahead with its Airports National Policy Statement, which, if approved by Parliament, would effectively give permission for planning for Heathrow's expansion to proceed. The Transport Committee wants more more stringent night flight rules. ""We recommend that affected communities are provided with a minimum average period of 7 hours of respite a night. The exact timing of this respite should be determined through joint working between the airport, airlines and communities,"" the report said. It also has concerns about the environment and costs. ""Thousands of people across London could be exposed to worse levels of noise, air quality and traffic congestion - there must be sufficient measures to protect or compensate them,"" said Lilian Greenwood, chair of the Transport Committee. ""The draft [statement] does not guarantee that passengers will be protected from the cost risks associated with the scheme. The secretary of state must set out how airport charges will be held down,"" she said. Heathrow welcomed the MPs' report and called for Parliament to allow the project to move into the planning phase. ""We are also clear that we will deliver an expanded Heathrow that is sustainable, affordable and financeable,"" a spokesperson said. The CBI has also urged government to finalise the airport strategy: ""With the new global links that it will bring, and the opportunity to unlock jobs right across the UK, getting on with building the third runway at Heathrow is a vital part of this equation."" Critics have long argued that a new runway at Heathrow would disrupt local communities. John Stewart, chair of campaigning group Hacan, estimates the number of flights from Heathrow will increase from about 476,000 to more than 700,000 a year. ""We are disappointed that they haven't said no to a third runway... but having said that we do welcome the conditions on air pollution and noise that they are recommending,"" he told the BBC. He said he particularly welcomed the proposed night flight ban. IAG, which owns British Airways and Iberia and is the biggest user of the airport, has criticised the proposed cost of Heathrow's expansion plans as ""exorbitant and unacceptably vague"". Willie Walsh, IAG chief executive, said: ""It's critical the National Policy Statement includes a detailed cost breakdown with the condition that airport charges be held flat in real terms, before Parliament votes on it."" MPs are expected to vote on the airports policy statement in the first half of this year. If it is approved, the proposals will enter an official planning process. Heathrow hopes to start building a new runway in early 2021, with completion by the end of 2025. In 2015, the Airports Commission concluded that a proposal for a north-west runway at Heathrow was the best option for airport expansion in the South East. With only a few months to go before a Parliamentary vote to rubber-stamp the proposal, the Transport Committee has urged the government to go back to the drawing board. The detail on projected costs and benefits is not sufficiently granular, the committee says, for the current proposal to avoid legal challenge. In addition, the MPs say not enough safeguards are in place to ensure that passengers and airlines do not foot the bill through higher airport charges. Getting this document, called the National Policy Statement, right matters because it is what the transport secretary will use to judge Heathrow's planning application. Given the scope of the changes that have been recommended, it appears we are still some way from planning permission being granted, let alone seeing the bulldozers move in.

"Lazarus pictured with Geoffrey the Giraffe, the company mascot The man who founded Toys R Us - the children's toy retailer - has died aged 94, one week after his company announced it was closing its doors. Charles Lazarus began selling toys in 1957 in large supermarket-style shops after he returned from World War II military service. His death comes after the company announced it would close all US and UK shops and seek bankruptcy protection. The ""heartbreaking"" news of his death was tweeted on Thursday by the firm. ""There have been many sad moments for Toys R Us in recent weeks, and none more heartbreaking than today's news about the passing of our beloved founder, Charles Lazarus,"" the company wrote online.

In a press release,external,  Toys R Us said he had been in ""declining health"" and that ""we will forever be grateful for his positive energy, passion for the customer and love for children everywhere"". Earlier on Thursday, the company announced it would suspend the liquidation sales of hundreds of its stores due to ""unforeseen circumstances"". In a 2008 interview with Entrepreneur magazine, Lazarus explained that he opened the business because all of his military friends were telling him the same thing as they returned to the US following the war. They were all saying they were going back to get married and raise children, which gave him the idea to first begin by selling children's furniture. After returning to his family's home in the Washington DC suburbs in 1948, he converted his father's bicycle shop into a furniture business called Children's Supermart, with the letter 'R' spelled backwards. He later explained that the R was made to make the title of the business look as though a child had written it. The backwards R was also famously used in the name of Toys R Us. Toys R Us to close all US stores Lazarus later moved on to toys and games, saying that ""toys are a great kind of thing to sell, because they don't last that long"". Before the founding of Toys R Us, the market for children's toys was mostly considered to be a seasonal industry. A 1986 profile in the Atlantic Monthly magazine called Lazarus ""the person most responsible for loosening Santa's grip on the toy business"". Toys R Us sold nappies at steep discounts, hoping parents would pass the savings along to their children, according to Bloomberg. The company has struggled since Lazarus left in 1994, as the rise of online shopping kept more and more families from visiting the shops. Last week the company announced it would close all of its remaining locations in the US, just a week after announcing it would do the same for its businesses in the UK.

"A shadow cabinet minister has broken ranks with official Labour Party policy to call for another Brexit referendum. Shadow Northern Ireland Secretary Owen Smith said a vote should be held when talks with the EU have concluded. Inan article for the Guardian,,externalhe also called for Labour to back membership of the EU single market. Labour's shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer said the party was ""not calling for a referendum at this stage"". Jeremy Corbyn announced last month that Labour wanted the UK to be a permanent member of a customs union with the EU after Brexit. May urges 'new dynamic' in Brexit talks Corbyn backs customs union membership But Mr Smith, who unsuccessfully challenged Mr Corbyn for the Labour leadership in 2016, said that was not enough. ""If we insist on leaving the EU then there is realistically only one way to honour our obligations under the Good Friday Agreement and that is to remain members of both the customs union and the single market,"" he said in his article. ""I'm pleased my party has taken a big step in this direction by backing continued customs union membership, but we need to go further."" He argued that Labour ""needs to do more than just back a soft Brexit or guarantee a soft border in Ireland"". ""Given that it is increasingly obvious that the promises the Brexiters made to the voters - especially, but not only, their pledge of an additional Â£350m a week for the NHS - are never going to be honoured, we have the right to keep asking if Brexit remains the right choice for the country. ""And to ask, too, that the country has a vote on whether to accept the terms, and true costs of that choice, once they are clear. That is how Labour can properly serve our democracy and the interests of our people."" Steve Baker accused Labour of ""frustrating"" Brexit Conservative Brexit Minister Steve Baker accused Labour of ""trying to frustrate the Brexit process"". ""These comments show that on one of the biggest issues facing the country, Labour have no interest in making a success of it, betraying millions of Labour voters. ""Only the Conservatives are getting on with delivering what British people voted for, taking back control of our laws, borders and money."" Sir Keir Starmer said Labour's position was that the ""benefits of the single market and customs union... need to be hard-wired into the final agreement"". ""We want a strong relationship with the single market with no drop-offs in rights, standards or protections,"" he added. Asked if Mr Smith was going against official party policy with his comments, Sir Keir said: ""That's not a matter for me to comment on. My focus is on ensuring we are challenging the government appropriately on the negotiations with the EU. "" Mr Smith argued for a second EU referendum during his abortive Labour leadership bid - but Jeremy Corbyn has consistently ruled one out, saying that the public had come to a decision, and has insisted the UK cannot remain in the single market. Chuka Umunna backs Owen Smith's comments Other shadow cabinet members have appeared more open to the idea of another referendum. In January 2018, shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show she would consider it only in exceptional circumstances - ""if 90% of the population was now saying we will stay in the European Union"". Labour's deputy leader, Tom Watson, did not rule out a second referendum, in a December 2017 interview with BBC Radio 5 Live's Pienaar's Politics, but added: ""What we actually want is a negotiated settlement."" Anti-Brexit Labour backbenchers such as Chuka Umunna, a member of the cross-party Open Britain campaign, have also argued for a second referendum. Mr Umunna said Mr Smith was ""absolutely right"" to say that Labour ""needs to go further in opposing the government on Brexit"", saying the Leave campaign had made promises ""we now know cannot be delivered on"". ""If we are not going to be offered the Brexit we were promised we have every right to ask whether Brexit is the right path for the country,"" he said.

"Rebels say they want talks with Russia's military to guarantee the safety of civilians One of the remaining Syrian rebel groups in the besieged enclave of Eastern Ghouta, outside Damascus, has announced a ceasefire. The Faylaq al-Rahman group said the UN-brokered truce was to begin in the south of the enclave at 22:00 GMT. It said the move would allow talks with the Russian military, Syria's ally, on guarantees for the safety of civilians. Rebels in another part of the area reached a similar deal earlier. Syrian troops have taken 70% of the enclave. In recent weeks, they have cut the Eastern Ghouta into three separate pockets. 'We will stay until the end': A doctor's battle in Eastern Ghouta Eastern Ghouta devastation seen from space Why is there a war in Syria? Spokesman Wael Alwan said late on Thursday that a ceasefire had been agreed ""in order to negotiate with the Russian side about finding a solution to guarantee the safety of civilians"". The truce deal was reached ""through the auspices of the United Nations"", said the group, which controls the southern pocket around Arbin and Zamalka. There has been no comment from either Russia's military, the Syrian government or the UN. It was not immediately known whether the truce was actually in force after 22:00 GMT on Thursday. It was offered by the Syrian army to Ahrar al-Sham rebels, who until recently controlled the key town of Harasta in the north-west. The rebels agreed to lay down their weapons and leave Harasta. Buses carrying 1,480 people, including 600 Ahrar al-Sham rebels, drove out of the town earlier on Thursday, en route to the rebel-held northern province of Idlib. A military source said hundreds more were expected to follow on Friday. This video can not be played Eastern Ghouta: A mother's diary of life under siege That evacuation deal was the first agreed since the offensive on the Eastern Ghouta was stepped up a month ago.

"Dave Smith says campaigners have been vindicated Scotland Yard has admitted Special Branch officers passed information to a controversial network that blacklisted construction workers. It follows a six-year battle to find out if the Metropolitan Police supplied the intelligence on trade unionists. The force says its investigation had ""proven"" the allegation, which will be investigated by a public inquiry. Workers who say they were unfairly barred from jobs have already received millions of pounds in compensation. In 2016, the union Unite reached a settlement with construction firms that resulted in 256 workers sharing more than Â£10m in compensation. At the heart of the claims, which were made by hundreds of workers, was evidence that firms accesseda ""blacklist"" that logged workers' trade union activities. The list was used by dozens of construction firms to vet those applying for work on building sites. When the files were found to contain details of individual's political activities, the workers demanded that Scotland Yard disclose whether undercover police had colluded in supplying intelligence. The blacklisting scandal came to light in 2009 following a raid by the information commissioner's office on an organisation called the Consulting Association It uncovered a list of more than 3,000 workers - which in some instances also included details of personal relationships and their political activity as well as their trade union links on building sites Eight firms which used the list were sued by the workers: Carillion, Balfour Beatty, Costain, Kier, Laing O'Rourke, Sir Robert McAlpine, Skanska UK and Vinci The eight firms issued an unreserved apology for their part in the system It's thought that more than 700 workers shared Â£75m in settlement compensation - with many others having earlier settled for smaller amounts In a letter to the workers' lawyers, Deputy Assistant Commissioner Richard Martin said the findings of the Metropolitan Police's internal investigation, completed two years ago, were so sensitive that they were sent directly to the then commissioner. The letter states: ""Allegation: Police, including Special Branches, supplied information that appeared on the Blacklist, funded by the country's major construction firms. ""The report concludes that, on the balance of probabilities, the allegation that the police or Special Branches supplied information is 'proven'. ""Material revealed a potentially improper flow of information from Special Branch to external organisations, which ultimately appeared on the blacklist."" Dave Smith, of the Blacklist Support Group, says a 36-page file on him - disclosed to him during the original investigation by the information commissioner - included details of his trade union work and information that appeared to have come from undercover monitoring of his political campaigning. ""When we first talked about police collusion in blacklisting, people thought we were conspiracy theorists,"" he said. ""We were told, things like that don't happen here. With this admission from the Met Police, our quest for the truth has been vindicated."" Undercover policing inquiry: Chairman urged to quit Can the undercover police inquiry get to the truth? Evidence given to Parliament suggested that one undercover officer who infiltrated Mr Smith's union was  Mark ""Cassidy"" Jenner, a member of Scotland Yard's now disbanded Special Demonstration Squad (SDS). The SDS's activities are at the heart of the long-delayed public inquiry into alleged abuses by undercover police. While Scotland Yard's letter says there is no evidence that SDS officers passed information to the blacklist network, a separate document published by the inquiry has revealed the existence of a unit called the ""Industrial Intelligence Section,external"". In a statement, Scotland Yard said it had apologised for the delay in releasing the outcome of its blacklist the investigation. ""Allegations about police involvement with the 'Blacklist' will be fully explored during the Undercover Policing Public Inquiry,"" it said. ""At this stage the MPS will await the conclusions of the UCPI before considering what steps should be taken next.""

"After a night of heated dinner debate over Russia, EU leaders turn their palates and attention this morning to a breakfast - though as this summit timetable keeps shifting, possibly brunch - discussion about Brexit. The two issues are closely linked. Theresa May came to Brussels looking for a robust response to the Salisbury attack. This was important for her not just in security terms. It was also her first test after a year of often bad-tempered Brexit negotiations to see if she could still rally European support in times of need. She could. EU leaders are divided over what action they want to take against Russia after Salisbury, but they often fall out over foreign policy. This is not a reflection of fading solidarity with the UK because of Brexit. In fact, the EU is adamant on maintaining close security relations with a post-Brexit Britain. Traditionally Brussels has looked to the US for protection, but an unpredictable President Trump in the White House means EU leaders now think Europe should be better prepared to defend itself - in terms of cyber-security, preventing further terror attacks, and the prudent use of sanctions. With this they want the UK's help. This video can not be played Theresa May said, after talks, that it was ""right that we stand together"" The EU's future relationship with the UK will thus be at the heart of Friday's Brexit debate at the summit. It's the moment the UK has been waiting for - when European leaders give the nod to their chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, to (finally, from a British point of view) begin talks about trade and the rest of the EU-UK post-Brexit relationship. London hopes this will lead to a groundbreaking trade deal between the two sides - one so deep and wide-reaching that, among other things, it will dissipate concerns about the appearance of a post-Brexit hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. This, until now, has been a persistent sticking point in Brexit negotiations. Brussels remains sceptical but the UK government hopes trade talks will see EU unity over Brexit crumble, to its advantage, as the national interests of individual countries come to the fore. A bespoke trade deal with the UK could cause tensions with France and Germany, who want to protect the EU single market It was easy for EU leaders to stick together in the first phase of Brexit negotiations - about the ""Brexit bill"" presented to the UK. They all wanted money. But look ahead to a future trade deal, and EU countries start to sing from different hymn sheets. Denmark is focused on fishing quotas, while Luxembourg fixates on financial services, Poland ponders security pacts and France and Germany insist on no rule-bending at all for the UK. EU leaders will attempt to contain their differences but it's going to be an interesting few months. In the meantime another special on the Brexit menu will be the rubber-stamping of the transition arrangement, the 21-month period after the UK formally leaves the EU on 29 March 2019. Businesses in the UK and the EU are thrilled about this. Uncertainty over Brexit has been costly, and fears there could be no deal at all were commonplace before this week. These fears shouldn't disappear entirely. David Davis and Michel Barnier highlighted areas of agreement between the UK and the EU on the transition period on Monday Brexit negotiations could still break down. If they do, under the EU mantra of ""nothing is agreed until everything is agreed"", the transition period could be scrapped before it begins. That said, EU leaders sound optimistic that a Brexit deal will be struck- though many question why the UK should be UK delighted that Brussels has allowed it to sign trade deals with other countries during the transition period. ""Doesn't Downing Street realise,"" one EU diplomat muttered to me, ""no country: not the US, Japan, no-one will want to complete a trade deal with the UK until they know what kind of relationship London has with us (the EU)? ""That's what will clinch the UK's value to them."" You won't be surprised when I tell you that UK negotiators disagree.

"Asian shares have been hit by fears that US President Donald Trump's plan for tariffs on up to $60bn of Chinese products could trigger a trade war. Japan's Nikkei 225 index fell 4.5% and the Shanghai Composite fell 3.6%. China responded to news of the planned tariffs by saying that while it did not want a trade war, it was ""absolutely not afraid"" of one. Mr Trump's proposed tariffs are a response to allegations of intellectual property theft by China. The US launched a complaint against China at the World Trade Organization (WTO) on Friday. Its statement said: ""China appears to be breaking WTO rules by denying foreign patent holders, including US companies, basic patent rights to stop a Chinese entity from using the technology after a licensing contract ends."" ""China also appears to be breaking WTO rules by imposing mandatory adverse contract terms that discriminate against and are less favourable for imported foreign technology."" Trump: Tariffs on $60bn in Chinese goods US exempts EU from steel tariffs Reality Check: Is Trump right about US trade deficit? How a trade war might affect you Beijing said it firmly opposed the planned tariffs but China's ministry of commerce said it was ""confident and capable of meeting any challenge"". ""China will not sit idly by its own legitimate rights and interests. We are fully prepared to defend our legitimate interests,"" the ministry said. But it said it hoped the US would not drag bilateral economic and trade relations into danger. Fears of a trade war pushed Asian stock markets down sharply.China's Shanghai Composite Indexclosed down 3.6% whileHong Kong's Hang Seng indexended 2.5% lower. ""Equity markets have sold-off heavily this morning as investors are fearful we are entering a trade war,"" said David Maddon, market analyst at CMC Markets UK. ""Traders don't like the look of the political landscape, and they are seeking safe-haven assets."" China is a huge consumer of pork and pork products Earlier on Friday, China announced its own set of proposed tariffs worth $3bn. Beijing said these were in response toUS tariffs on steel and aluminium imports announced by Mr Trump earlier this month. The US tariffs on steel and aluminium imports come into effect this week. China's commerce ministry said it was planning two steps of retaliatory action: a 15% tariff on 120 goods worth almost $1bn - including fresh fruit, nuts and wine a 25% tariff on eight goods worth nearly $2bn - including pork and aluminium scrap. The US imports billions more goods from China each year than it exports, creating a deficit of about $375bn last year  -  a figures which Mr Trump has railed against. The president said on Thursday he had asked China to cut that deficit by $100bn ""immediately"". Last August, Mr Trump ordered an investigation into Chinese policies and his proposed tariffs reflect the outcome of that probe. The White House said the investigation found a range of ""unfair"" practices in China, including restrictions on foreign ownership that pressured foreign companies into transferring technology. The review also found evidence that China imposes unfair terms on US companies; steers investments in the US to strategic industries; and conducts and supports cyber attacks. Trump: Political heir to Abe Lincoln? The problem facing Trump's China probe EU and six other countries exempted from US metals tariffs The White House said it had a list of more than 1,000 products that could be targeted by tariffs of 25%. Businesses will have the opportunity to comment before the final list goes into effect. The US is also exploring ways to limit Chinese investment in the US. It says it will bring any matter it thinks is unfair to the WTO - as it is doing in the case of intellectual property. US officials had acknowledged the possibility of retaliation from China, but said the Asian giant ultimately had more to lose. If imposed as described, the US tariffs could lead to higher costs for consumers, while China's retaliation would hit key sectors of the US economy including agriculture and aerospace, analysts say. China is one of the biggest buyers of US soybeans China was the third largest market for US exports in 2016 and among the biggest buyers of American corn, pork and aircraft. China is also the world's biggest consumer of soybeans and consumes about one third of the US crop. But in news which will come as a relief to US farmers, Friday's announcement did not include the soybeans. Critics of Mr Trump's policies dismiss worries about the trade deficit, saying the exchange benefits both sides. However, there is growing bipartisan concern in America about China's state-led economy and there is a worry that China is seeking technology that could be deployed for military purposes. Mr Trump's America First policy remains popular with large sections of the US public. However, trade watchers in Asia says China's retaliation will no doubt be carefully targeted to hit key Trump-supporting areas of the US. ""The Chinese have been developing their list for more than a year and they are very good,"" said Deborah Elms, executive director of the Asian Trade Centre in Singapore. ""If things get very nasty, they can also make life very difficult for US companies doing business in China.  It's going to be very interesting.""

"Lazarus pictured with Geoffrey the Giraffe, the company mascot The man who founded Toys R Us - the children's toy retailer - has died aged 94, one week after his company announced it was closing its doors. Charles Lazarus began selling toys in 1957 in large supermarket-style shops after he returned from World War II military service. His death comes after the company announced it would close all US and UK shops and seek bankruptcy protection. The ""heartbreaking"" news of his death was tweeted on Thursday by the firm. ""There have been many sad moments for Toys R Us in recent weeks, and none more heartbreaking than today's news about the passing of our beloved founder, Charles Lazarus,"" the company wrote online.

In a press release,external,  Toys R Us said he had been in ""declining health"" and that ""we will forever be grateful for his positive energy, passion for the customer and love for children everywhere"". Earlier on Thursday, the company announced it would suspend the liquidation sales of hundreds of its stores due to ""unforeseen circumstances"". In a 2008 interview with Entrepreneur magazine, Lazarus explained that he opened the business because all of his military friends were telling him the same thing as they returned to the US following the war. They were all saying they were going back to get married and raise children, which gave him the idea to first begin by selling children's furniture. After returning to his family's home in the Washington DC suburbs in 1948, he converted his father's bicycle shop into a furniture business called Children's Supermart, with the letter 'R' spelled backwards. He later explained that the R was made to make the title of the business look as though a child had written it. The backwards R was also famously used in the name of Toys R Us. Toys R Us to close all US stores Lazarus later moved on to toys and games, saying that ""toys are a great kind of thing to sell, because they don't last that long"". Before the founding of Toys R Us, the market for children's toys was mostly considered to be a seasonal industry. A 1986 profile in the Atlantic Monthly magazine called Lazarus ""the person most responsible for loosening Santa's grip on the toy business"". Toys R Us sold nappies at steep discounts, hoping parents would pass the savings along to their children, according to Bloomberg. The company has struggled since Lazarus left in 1994, as the rise of online shopping kept more and more families from visiting the shops. Last week the company announced it would close all of its remaining locations in the US, just a week after announcing it would do the same for its businesses in the UK.

"Det Sgt Nick Bailey said he had been ""overwhelmed"" by support from the public A police officer who fell ill after being exposed to the nerve agent used on a Russian ex-spy and his daughter has been discharged from hospital. Det Sgt Nick Bailey was left seriously ill after responding to the attack on Sergei Skripal, 66, and Yulia Skripal, 33, in Salisbury earlier this month. The pair remain in a critical but stable condition in hospital. Det Sgt Bailey said that ""normal life for me will probably never be the same"" as he also thanked hospital staff. He said in a statement that there were ""no words"" to explain how he felt, adding: ""It really has been completely surreal"". He added: ""I have been so very overwhelmed by the support, cards and messages I have received - everyone has been so incredible."" His wife, Sarah, said: ""This has quite simply been the most traumatic event of our lives and it feels like our world has been turned upside down in a really short space of time."" Russian spy: What we know so far Conspiracy theories and denial in Russia World Cup Nazi comments 'irresponsible' Another police officer who responded to the attack on 4 March is being treated as an outpatient by Salisbury District Hospital, the BBC understands. Since the incident, nearly 50 other people had sought medical advice from the hospital. Cara Charles-Barks, chief executive of Salisbury NHS Foundation Trust, said medical staff were ""working around the clock"" to care for the Skripals. A judge has said it is unclear if the pair, who were found slumped on a shopping centre bench in Salisbury, would fully recover from the nerve agent attack. Judge David Williams, of the Court of Protection, said their mental capacity may have been compromised to an ""unknown"" degree. Sergei and Yulia Skripal were found slumped on a shopping centre bench on 4 March The court, which hears issues affecting the welfare of sick or vulnerable people, has given doctors permission to take blood samples from the Skripals to send to chemical weapons experts. A team from the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, which arrived in the UK earlier this week, will conduct the tests. Delivering the ruling, Judge Williams said: ""Medical tests indicate that their mental capacity might be compromised to an unknown and so far unascertained degree."" He said no-one known to Mr and Ms Skripal had approached the hospital where they were being cared for to ""inquire of their welfare"". This video can not be played May: Russian threat does not respect borders Meanwhile, EU leaders have agreed it is""highly likely"" Russia was behind the attack, after Prime Minister Theresa May appealed to fellow heads of state for unity. European Council president Donald Tusk said there was ""no other plausible explanation"" for the incident. Earlier, Mrs May told a summit in Brussels that the Salisbury attack was ""part of a pattern of Russian aggression against Europe"" and stressed the need to stand together.

"The US plans to impose tariffs on up to $60bn (Â£42.5bn) in Chinese imports and limit the country's investment in the US in retaliation for years of alleged intellectual property theft. The White House said the actions were necessary to counter unfair competition from China's state-led economy. It said years of talks had failed to produce change. China said it was ready to retaliate with ""necessary measures"". Beijing also said it would ""fight to the end"" in any trade war with the US. US stock markets closed lower on Thursday, as investors responded to the announcement.

He said the tariffs might be imposed on up to $60bn in Chinese goods - boosting the number from the roughly $50bn figure White House officials cited on Thursday morning during a briefing. The tariffs follow an investigation of Chinese policies ordered by Mr Trump in August. The White House said the review found a range of ""unfair"" practices in China, including restrictions on foreign ownership that pressured foreign companies into transferring technology. The review also found evidence that China imposes unfair terms on US companies; steers investments in the US to strategic industries; and conducts and supports cyber attacks. The White House said it has a list of more than 1,000 products that could be targeted by tariffs of 25%. Businesses will have the opportunity to comment before the final list goes into effect. Trump: Political heir to Abe Lincoln? The problem facing Trump's China probe EU and six other countries exempted from US metals tariffs The US is also exploring ways to limit Chinese investment in the US and will seek to bring complaints about unfair licensing terms to the World Trade Organization, officials said. America's top trade negotiator, Robert Lighthizer, said protecting US technology was critical to America's economic future. America's top trade negotiator, Robert Lighthizer, said the US wanted to put ""maximum pressure on China and minimum pressure on US consumers"". On Thursday, China's commerce ministry said it was ready to retaliate against the new tariffs. ""China will not sit idly by and let its legitimate rights and interests be harmed, and will certainly take all necessary measures to resolutely defend its legitimate rights and interests,"" it said in a statement. The ministry also pointed to a ruling by the World Trade Organization (WTO) that found that Washington had not fully complied with a 2014 ruling against its anti-subsidy tariffs on Chinese products, including solar panels and wind towers. China's commerce ministry said the WTO ruling ""proves that the US side has violated WTO rules"" and ""repeatedly abused trade remedy measures"". ""[This] has seriously damaged the fair and just nature of the international trade environment, and weakened the stability of the multilateral trading system."" The WTO has also ruled against China's trade practices. In January, the organisation said China must lower its tariffs on broiler chickens imported from the US. If imposed as described, the tariffs could lead to higher costs for consumers, while retaliation would hit key sectors of the US economy including agriculture and aerospace, analysts say. China was the third largest market for US exports in 2016 and among the biggest buyers of American soybeans, corn, pork and aircraft. On Thursday, shares of plane-maker Boeing sank more than 5%. Representatives of states such as Kansas, which has a large farming base, have been among the most critical of the administration's approach. Several business groups said they agree that there is a problem, but are worried about the administration's strategy. ""American business wants to see solutions to these problems, not just sanctions such as unilateral tariffs that may do more harm than good,"" said John Frisbie, president of the US-China Business Council, which represents firms that do business in China. US officials acknowledged the possibility of retaliation but say China has more to lose from the relationship. The US imports billions more goods from China each year than it exports, creating a deficit of about $375bn last year that Mr Trump has railed against. The president said Thursday he has asked China to cut that deficit by $100bn ""immediately"". This video can not be played Trump constantly worries about the trade deficit - should we? Many analysts dismiss worries about the trade deficit, noting that the exchange benefits both sides. However, there is growing bipartisan concern in America about China's state-led economy and worry that China is seeking technology that could be deployed for military purposes. Congress is debating legislation that would boost the government's power to review foreign business deals, citing the threat posed by state-backed acquisition of US firms. Some politicians remain critical of the administration's approach, saying Mr Trump's bluster aggravates the situation and alienates allies who could help address the problem. ""I get a kind of stomp-your-feet approach makes some people feel good, but in the integrated economy we already have, it's more complex,"" Senator Maria Cantwell, a Democrat from Washington, said at a Senate Finance Committee hearing on Thursday. Steel producers around the world are concerned about US tariffs on steel imports Mr Trump has embraced ""America First"" rhetoric - including criticism of China - that blames other countries for the loss of American jobs and plays well with parts of his base.

His administration has publicised cases brought for dumping goods in the US below cost, but the end result of some of his actions remain in flux. For example, in March, he signed controversial orders imposing heavy tariffs on steel and aluminium - but said some countries such as Canada and Mexico would be spared. The EU and other countries are also in line for exemptions. He is also renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) with Canada and Mexico. Nafta governs more than $1tn in trade China has previously said there would be no winner from any trade war. It has also urged both sides to remain calm and hinted at making reforms ""beyond expectations"" to satisfy the US. Mr Trump has previously tweeted ""trade wars are good, and easy to win."" But US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin recently said the president ""was not trying to start a trade war"". Frank Lavin, chief executive of Export Now and a former US ambassador to Singapore, said China typically takes some kind of action, but avoids escalating the problem. But David Kuo, chief executive of the Motley Fool in Singapore, said it is not clear yet how this will play out in the long run. ""Some are hoping that this is just an opening gambit by the US.

"The UK prime minister welcomed a ""new dynamic"" in the talks EU leaders have approved guidelines for the negotiation of future relations with the UK after Brexit. The text,externalon trade, security and other issues was agreed in ""less than half a minute"", clearing the way for the next phase of Brexit talks to get under way. The UK is due to leave in March 2019 and negotiators have said they want a deal in place by the end of the year. Prime Minister Theresa May said she believed there was a new ""spirit of co-operation and opportunity"". The formal adoption of the guidelines, although widely expected, is seen as another key step as the Brexit process gathers momentum. The guidelines give chief negotiator Michel Barnier the mandate to talk directly to the UK about the future relationship with a view to reaching a broad political agreement by October to allow the EU and UK parliaments time to consider it. Pienaar: So can May now survive Brexit course? Reality Check: What have EU leaders agreed on Brexit? Labour frontbencher backs second EU vote European Council President Donald Tusk said the ""positive momentum"" should be used to settle outstanding issues like avoiding a hard border in Northern Ireland. EU leaders will decide in June whether the ""Irish question"" has been resolved and will look into a ""common declaration on our future"", he added. Mrs May, who was not present when her colleagues met to discuss Brexit, said she believed there was a ""new dynamic"" in the negotiations. ""I believe we are approaching this with a spirit of co-operation, a spirit of opportunity for the future as well, and we will now be sitting down and determining those workable solutions for Northern Ireland, but also for our future security partnership and economic partnership,"" she said. ""I believe it is in the best interest of both the UK and the EU that we get a deal that actually is in the interests of both."" By the BBC's Europe reporter Adam Fleming EU leaders have given their chief negotiator Michel Barnier a mandate to talk about trade While welcoming the progress so far, there is a reminder that there is no legal certainty, including over the transition deal, until the whole agreement is ratified. Last-minute wrangling by Spain has led to the inclusion of a reference to the EU's position on Gibraltar. It says that Spain and the UK have to reach a separate deal over it. The EU's big offer is a close future relationship based on a free trade agreement with no tariffs on goods and a close partnership on security and defence, both of which the UK wants. The UK's ""red lines"" will limit the closeness of the future relationship. A sentence says Brexit will cause economic consequences for both sides, which was tweaked to specify the UK would be the worse off. What has been dubbed the ""evolution clause"" indicates that the EU will reconsider its offer to Britain if the UK government compromises on its red lines, such as by remaining in the customs union. The EU fears competition from the UK and is demanding a ""level playing field"" between the two - including ways to prevent potential undercutting on tax, environmental and labour standards. While not directly mentioning financial services, the EU says it will jealously guard its financial stability. The remaining 27 leaders have also endorsed an agreement reached earlier this week on a 21-month transition period between March 2019, when the UK officially leaves, and the end of 2020. During that period, the UK will be able to negotiate, sign and ratify its own trade deals, while EU citizens arriving in the UK will enjoy the same rights and guarantees as those who arrive before Brexit. A solution to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland has yet to be agreed, with the EU insisting on a ""backstop"" option of Northern Ireland, in effect, remaining in the customs union. Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said he wanted an agreement that keeps the UK ""as close as possible"" to the EU in order to protect trade and jobs. But Labour, which supports staying in the customs union, said the UK and EU were a ""very long way away"" from achieving this at the moment and the PM needed to ""finally drop her reckless red lines"". Meanwhile, EU leaders are calling for reciprocal access to UK fishing waters and stocks to be maintained after the end of the transition period. Asked whether he thought the UK would agree to this, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker told BBC Scotland this was the EU's ""working basis"". ""We are in ongoing discussions with the UK - to try and bring them (to) where we are and they are trying to bring us (to) where they are,"" he said. The UK has already agreed to abide by the rules of the Common Fisheries Policy during the transition, sparking anger among fishing groups which want full sovereignty over UK waters upon Brexit.
