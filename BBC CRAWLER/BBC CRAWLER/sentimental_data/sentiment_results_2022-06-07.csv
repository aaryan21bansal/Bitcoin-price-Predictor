"At first glance they are an unlikely line up for aid workers in a war zone - a dog trainer from Kent, a farmer from Cornwall, and a technology executive from Sussex. But these three British volunteers were drawn - separately - to Ukraine. They teamed up here and have spent months in harm's way evacuating the elderly and the frail from areas near front lines.  They fund themselves and prefer not to be named. ""I know my parents worry,"" says the dog trainer who, at 21, is the youngest. ""I have had phone calls with my mum where she has been in tears, but they are just really proud of what I am doing. They know I will be out here for a while, and they don't know when I will be coming home."" As we speak, air raid sirens wail and explosions thud in the distance now and then. She hopes one day to be a qualified paramedic. For now, she has done a course in trauma first aid, and is learning on the job. When we joined the volunteers for a day, she was quick to check the lower leg of an evacuee with a blackened, gangrenous wound.  Medical care had already been arranged for him at a safe distance. The team regularly travel to and from towns and cities in the path of Russian forces who are grinding forward across the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine. Shelling is a constant threat. One run was so risky they were ordered by the Ukrainian military to put their body armour on. 'I know my parents worry': the 21-year-old has put her life on hold ""There have been a few moments when you feel it's a bit close for comfort,"" she says. ""We stick together. As much danger as we are in, we feel quite prepared and reliable as a team."" They concede that some may wonder what they are doing in this war-torn region, and how much help they can provide. ""I didn't expect that we would be needed or wanted,"" says the farmer, ""but we are.""  Back in the UK he was tending to cattle and sheep before losing his job.  After Russia invaded Ukraine, he filled a van with aid and drove it over from the UK.  It now serves as their rough and ready ambulance. ""In an ideal world we would be redundant,"" he says, ""but we are not. We are here doing what we can. We are not experts, but we've done a lot in the last few months. I don't feel like there's anything else I could be doing that's more important than this."" He was behind the wheel on the day of our visit, but the volunteers stress they share the load, and the highs and lows, buoying each other up with ""British humour"". 96-year-old Anastacia, one of the many people the three volunteers have helped They have moved about 150 people in recent months - some to hospital in the city of Kramatorsk, others to a train station in the Pokrovsk. They collaborate with an established Ukrainian NGO, Vostok SOS, which gives them lists of evacuees to be collected each day, along with information about their medical condition. As they grapple with day-to-day logistics and shifting front lines, the team has another concern - that international attention is fading. ""Aid is coming in slower,"" says the former farmer. ""That leads me to believe that people are becoming kind of used to the war, and I think that's something that really should not be happening."" 'Aid is coming in slower,' says the former farmer And he warns that there are still many in dire need of evacuation. ""Many people think those who needed to get out have gotten out,"" he says. ""That isn't the case."" The third member of the team was already in motion when the war broke out. She had spent six months travelling in the Middle East, after leaving her role working in technology in a start-up. ""My life infrastructure had already been put on pause,"" she tells me. ""So I've been free to come out here and stay out here indefinitely. We just want to get things done without any bureaucracy, any red tape. We work every day because this is what we care about. This is what matters because we are all Europeans. An attack on Ukraine by Russia is attack on all of us."" Her own family knows the trauma of war and dislocation. Her grandmother had to flee from Poland during World War Two. And when the team collect a 96-year old called Anastacia, she tenderly holds her hand.  Anastasia is painfully frail and has to be lifted with care.  Her 70-year-old son Yevgeny tells us they spent days below ground when their village was shelled. ""Four or five days ago they started firing with mortars,"" he says. ""Our garden was hit, just 10 metres from our house.  When it was so loud that everything shook, my mother was very scared."" The former technology worker came to Ukraine from the Middle East Anastasia is carefully carried on to a train, with Yevgeny by her side. Once again she has to flee, just as she did at 15, during World War Two. The volunteer - who is now a world away from her old life in high tech - says the hardest days are when they cannot evacuate everyone. Some don't want to go - reluctant to leave home and hearth even when the war is closing in. ""You hope that you're doing the right thing taking them away from their land, and that they will get to come home. But you don't know. And you think about that for every single person you evacuate. Will they get to come back?"" Her voice catches with emotion. ""The land here is beautiful,"" she tells me.  ""And I was told that if you take a Ukrainian away from that, they will die. Whenever I evacuate a woman, I will pick her a flower from outside her building to take away. That's the only thing I can do.""

"Douglas Ross has said the prime minister should think about resigning, after 41% of Tory MPs said they did not have confidence in his leadership. Asked by the BBC if Boris Johnson should resign, the Scottish Tory leader said: ""He's got to look at it."" He said MPs from ""across the entire parliamentary party"" had no confidence in Mr Johnson. Never had a prime minister lost as much support as he had on Monday, Mr Ross added. ""I think he really does have to reflect on that,"" the Scottish Tory leader said. Time to draw a line under Partygate, says PM PM vote: Scottish Secretary says time to move on Scottish Tories deserted PM in confidence vote The number of rebels in Monday night's confidence vote was higher than predicted. Mr Johnson was backed by 211 Conservative MPs while 148 voted to remove him. Mr Ross said the number of MPs who said they did not have faith in the PM's leadership would be ""particularly troubling"" for Boris Johnson, adding that it was ""extremely serious and something the prime minister has to reflect on"". Asked if Mr Johnson should resign, Mr Ross said: ""I think he's he's got to look at it."" He added: ""This isn't just some Scottish MPs, some Welsh MPs, a few from a certain part of England. ""This is across the entire parliamentary party - from people who supported staying in the EU and people who campaigned strongly to leave the EU, people who are on the right of the party, some in the centre and some on the left."" He would not be drawn on who he thought should lead the party after Mr Johnson, saying there were a lot of very good candidates. Asked whether the PM had misled parliament over Downing Street parties, Mr Ross said Mr Johnson's responses had been ""quite clear"" yet the evidence ""suggests otherwise"". And asked if Boris Johnson was a liar, Mr Ross said: ""I think he has serious questions to answer."" The Scottish Tory leader also responded to accusations from opposition parties that he had U-turned over whether the PM should go. He saidthere should be a confidence vote back in January, but hewithdrew the call in March when war broke out in Ukraine. Last month, after the Sue Gray report was published, Mr Ross said on balancehe still believed Boris Johnson should remain in office. He said toppling him would cause instability that would benefit Putin, but added that the PM would still have to go if an inquiry found he had misled parliament. Then on Monday, he saidhe was not one of the MPs who had called for the confidence vote- but said he would vote that he did not have confidence in the Mr Johnson's leadership. He said his belief that the PM should think about resigning was his final position, adding that the only change in recent months was the war in Ukraine. He highlighted that President Zelensky hadpraised the prime minister as an important ally of Ukraine. Mr Ross said: ""I didn't expect when I put in my letter to the 1922 committee in January that Russia would invade Ukraine. ""That's still ongoing. We've seen from President Zelensky just today that there are still huge troubles in Ukraine and they need more and more support now than perhaps at any point in over 100 days of conflict."" It still was not the right time for a leadership contest, he said, but noted that the confidence vote was prompted by other MPs in the party. However, given that the vote was being held he said he had decided to ""stick to"" his initial belief that the prime minister's actions had been ""damaging to the government, to the country, and people are still extremely upset about what happened"" over Partygate. As the MP for Moray, Douglas Ross was one of six Scottish Tory MPs who were entitled to cast a ballot in the confidence motion. Three other Scottish Tory MPs also said they had no confidence in Boris Johnson's leadership. That view is shared by the majority of Scottish Tory MSPs. However, two Scottish Tory MPs, including the Scottish Secretary Alister Jack, gave the prime minister their support.

"Thousands of railway workers will walk out in a three-day national strike later this month which threatens major summer travel disruption across the UK. The RMT Union said it will ""shut down"" the country's railway network on 21, 23 and 25 June after talks over pay and redundancies fell through. But the Transport Secretary accused RMT of ""jumping the gun"" and said strikes could put off people using trains. The action is being dubbed the ""biggest rail strike in modern history"". More than 40,000 staff from Network Rail and 13 train operators are expected to take part. On the first day of the planned strike on 21 June, London Underground RMT workers plan to walk out in a separate dispute over pensions and job losses, taking the total number of staff - along those from with Network Rail and the train companies - to more than 50,000. The BBC understands the action will leave around a fifth of mainline rail services running on the strike days, with the majority operating for a maximum of 12 hours. The industrial action also coincides with Glastonbury Festival, which runs from 22 to 26 June. When is the rail strike and which lines will be affected? RMT has said Network Rail plans to cut up to 2,500 jobs as part of a Â£2bn reduction in spending, with the proposed job cuts including workers who maintain tracks, signals and overhead lines among other things. It also claimed train operators had been subject to pay freezes and changes to their terms and conditions. ""We have a cost-of-living crisis, and it is unacceptable for railway workers to either lose their jobs or face another year of a pay freeze,"" Mick Lynch, RMT general secretary, said. Mr Lynch said the union was open to ""meaningful negotiations"" with rail bosses and ministers, but warned they would need ""new proposals to prevent months of disruption on our railways."" Andrew Haines, Network Rail's chief executive, said he understood the cost of living had increased, but argued the union ""must recognise we are a public body and any pay increase has to be affordable for taxpayers"". ""Travel habits have changed forever and the railway must change as well,"" he said. ""We cannot expect to take more than our fair share of public funds, and so we must modernise our industry to put it on a sound financial footing for the future. Failure to modernise will only lead to industry decline and more job losses in the long run."" Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said the decision to strike was ""incredibly disappointing"" and accused RMT of ""jumping the gun"" by announcing strike dates ""when talks have only just begun"". ""The pandemic has changed travel habits - with 25% fewer ticket sales and the taxpayer stepping in to keep the railways running at a cost of Â£16bn, equivalent to Â£600 per household. We must act now to put the industry on a sustainable footing,"" he added. ""We once again want to urge the unions to come to talks with the rail industry so we can work together to build a better, more modern, passenger-focussed, railway."" The Rail Delivery Group, which represents train operating firms, also urged the union to call off the strikes. Steve Montgomery, the industry body's chairman, said ""no one wins in the event of a strike"". ""Staff lose pay, the industry loses vital revenue making it harder to afford pay increases, and passengers and businesses are disrupted. ""While we will keep as many services running as possible, sadly if this action goes ahead, significant disruption will be inevitable. We therefore urge passengers to plan their journeys carefully and find alternative ways to travel during the strike period where possible.""â¯ If this strike goes ahead as proposed, only around a fifth of services would run on the strike dates themselves. But nearly the whole week's service would be severely affected in a week when several major sporting and cultural events are scheduled. A senior industry source said one reason is that if some signalling workers don't turn up for overnight shifts, the next day's morning peak will be affected. Now the dates are known, timetable planners will be rushing to put together a six-day timetable covering both strike dates and the days after. Work has been ongoing for a while to come up with contingency plans to try and minimise the impact on the economy. A key part of preparation now will be working with freight businesses to work out which goods can run on the railway with severely reduced capacity. In some cases, some key products could take priority over passenger services. An example of that might be fuel to a power station which has limited on-site storage.

"This video can not be played Watch: Missing journalist's wife makes tearful plea to step up Brazilian Amazon search The wife of a British journalist who disappeared in the Brazilian Amazon has urged the country's authorities to do more to find ""the love of my life"". Dom Phillips, 57, went missing in a remote part of the Amazon on Sunday along with Brazilian indigenous expert Bruno AraÃºjo Pereira, 41. In an tearful video, Mr Phillips's wife Alessandra Sampaio said she still had ""some small hope"" of finding them. Mr Pereira's family have also asked the authorities to speed up the search. On Tuesday, Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro appeared to blame the missing men for their disappearance. ""Two people in a boat in a region like that, completely wild - it's an unadvisable adventure. Anything can happen,"" he said. ""Maybe there was an accident, maybe they were executed,"" he said. Brazilian police have opened a criminal investigation following news that Mr Pereira had been threatened. Mr Pereira, an expert on isolated tribes in the Amazon who has worked for the government's indigenous affairs agency Funai, had clashed with some in riverside communities over illegal fishing. Dom Phillips, a veteran journalist, was travelling with Mr Pereira by boat through the Javari Valley near Brazil's border with Peru as part of his research for a book on conservation efforts in the Amazon. The huge region is home to around 6,300 indigenous people from more than 20 groups and is under threat from illegal loggers, miners and hunters. Indigenous rights groups that Mr Pereira worked with raised the alarm when the two failed to arrive as planned in the municipality of Atalaia do Norte on Sunday. The groups said that Mr Pereira had received death threats in the week before his disappearance over his fight against illegal fishing. Reuters news agency reported that the police had interviewed several local fishermen - including one man who is being treated as a potential suspect - who are believed to be among the last people to have seen the journalist and indigenous expert in the Javari Valley. A police official was quoted by Brazilian news G1 as saying that the suspect had denied any involvement in the disappearance of Mr Phillips and Mr Pereira. The official, Alex Perez, said the suspect had told police he had merely seen the two men speed past in their boat. Police are also trying to locate the fisherman suspected of writing a threatening letter to Mr Pereira just last week. The rights group which first sounded the alarm about the disappearance said that the security forces had failed to follow up on key leads. Eliesio Maruba of the Univaja rights group said that neither the police nor the navy had turned up to a scheduled meeting at which Univaja wanted to inform them about those it suspects of being behind the threats and their whereabouts. The response by the Brazilian authorities has been widely criticised as slow and inadequate. At first, only about a dozen people were sent to search the vast rainforest area crisscrossed by rivers. A helicopter was only sent on Tuesday and the number of soldiers deployed has been upped to 150. The size of the search team has been boosted but was small at first But the sluggishness of the search has caused further anguish for the men's families. Mr Pereira's wife has also released a video message urging quicker action and saying that she hoped the men's disappearance was down to their boat breaking down. However many fear the pair may have been targeted. As well as rising tension over illegal fishing, the area has seen incursions by illegal gold miners, loggers and drug traffickers who smuggle cocaine from neighbouring Peru. Mr Phillips has documented many of these threats in his articles for the Guardian newspaper in the UK as well as other publications such as the Financial Times and the Washington Post. Colleagues of the two have stressed that the men have deep knowledge of the region and carefully planned their trip.

"A USB Type-C charger (right) beside Apple's proprietary Lightning cable The UK government says it is not ""currently considering"" copying European Union plans for a common charging cable. The EU has provisionally agreed all new portable electronic devices must, by autumn 2024, use a USB Type-C charger, a move it says will benefit consumers. Critics say it will stifle innovation. Under the current post-Brexit arrangements, the regulation would apply to Northern Ireland, according to EU and UK officials. According to thea December 2021 parliamentary report,external, the ""new requirements may also apply to devices sold in Northern Ireland under the terms of the Northern Ireland protocol in the Brexit agreement, potentially triggering divergence of product standards with the rest of the UK"". The treaty works by keeping Northern Ireland inside the EU's single market for goods, while the rest of the UK is outside it. A row between the UK and EU about how to reform the Northern Ireland protocol remains unresolved. A UK government spokesperson said ""we are not currently considering replicating this requirement"". Apple products such as iPhones and iPads will have to conform to the new regulation, as will, eventually laptop computers. Existing devices will be exempt. The agreement will be brought before the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers after their summer recesses, where it can be formally approved and then published. Apple told the BBC it had no new comment to make. It argued against the proposal, when it was first introduced, in September 2021,with a representative telling BBC News:""Strict regulation mandating just one type of connector stifles innovation rather than encouraging it, which in turn will harm consumers in Europe and around the world"". Apple is the biggest manufacturer to use a custom charging port that is exclusive to some of its products - its iPhone series uses an Apple-made Lightning connector. The new rule will cover a range of ""small and medium-sized portable electronics"", according the EU, including: mobile phones tablets headphones and headsets handheld videogame consoles portable speakers Any of these charged using a wired cable will have to have a USB Type-C port, regardless of who makes the devices. Laptops will also have to abide by the ruling but manufacturers will have 40 months after it comes into effect to make changes. The agreement also includes a plan to let customers choose whether or not they want a charging cable with their new electronics. ""This law is a part of a broader EU effort to make products in the EU more sustainable, to reduce electronic waste, and make consumers' lives easier,""the EU said in its announcement,external. It would save consumers ""up to â¬250m [Â£213m] a year on unnecessary charger purchases"" and cut 11,000 tonnes of waste per year, the EU added.

"Rangers Football Club have been accused of conspiring to illegally fix the prices of club merchandise. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) provisionally found the club colluded with retailers JD Sports and Elite Sports to keep prices of replica kits high. The CMA said the three parties could expect heavy fines if found guilty. Rangers said they would review the provisional findings before submitting a response. The UK competition watchdog said it was concerned that Elite and JD Sports may have broken competition law from September 2018 to at least July 2019 over prices of Rangers merchandise. Its provisional findings said Rangers were also involved in the alleged collusion, but only to the extent of fixing the price of adult replica short-sleeved home shirts from September 2018 to at least mid-November 2018. Rangers face investigation over replica kit prices Michael Grenfell, executive director of enforcement at the CMA, said: ""Football fans are well-known for their loyalty towards their teams. ""We are concerned that, in this case, Elite, JD Sports and, to some extent, Rangers, may have colluded to keep prices high, so that the two retailers could pocket more money for themselves at the expense of fans."" The Scottish Premiership club said: ""The statement of objections represents the CMA's provisional view only. It is not a finding that Rangers has broken the law and does not mean that the CMA will issue a final decision or impose a fine on Rangers. ""Rangers is committed to operating its business in full compliance with all laws, including competition law, and treats this matter very seriously."" Rangers are accused of fixing the price of adult replica short-sleeved home shirts The parties involved now have the chance to make representation on the provisional findings before a final judgement is made. The CMA said that at the time, Elite was the manufacturer of Rangers-branded clothing and also sold the products directly through its Gers Online Store, and later in shops across Glasgow and Belfast. JD Sports was the only UK-wide retailer selling those Rangers club clothing items at the time. The CMA claims that Rangers FC became concerned that at the start of the 2018-19 football season, JD Sports was selling the Rangers replica top at a lower price than Elite, which was seen at the time as the club's so-called retail partner. The watchdog's provisional findings said they then conspired for JD to increase the price of the Rangers adult short-sleeved home replica shirt by nearly 10%, from Â£55 to Â£60, to bring it in line with Gers Online prices. The CMA also believes that Elite and JD, this time without involvement from Rangers, may have worked together to fix the prices of Rangers-branded clothing - including training wear and replica kit - over a longer period. It said this included the two firms aligning the amount and timing of discounts towards the end of the football season in 2019, to protect their profit margins at the expense of fans. The CMA said Elite and JD had confessed to cartel activity and had since co-operated with the watchdog. They could receive reduced fines if they continue to co-operate, according to the CMA. Businesses found guilty of breaking competition law can be fined up to 10% of annual turnover. JD Sports Fashion said it planned to book a hit of about Â£2m to cover any fine from the CMA and legal costs in its annual results for the year to 29 January, which it will release ""shortly"". Lisa Webb, Which? consumer law expert, said: ""It's completely unacceptable that sports retailers and a football club have been working together to exploit the loyalty of football fans by fixing the prices of kits. ""If this provisional finding is confirmed, the Competition and Markets Authority must not hesitate to heavily fine the guilty parties - and send a firm message that this behaviour is unacceptable and won't be tolerated.""

"The HS2 project aims to build high-speed rail links between London and Manchester, Birmingham and the East Midlands The government has scrapped plans to build a new Â£3bn rail link between HS2 and the West Coast Main Line. The 13-mile (21km) Golborne Link in Cheshire and Greater Manchester will not be built despite its earlier inclusion in the Integrated Rail Plan for improving the Midlands and North. The Railway Industry Association, Rail Freight Group and High Speed Rail Group fear a ""bottleneck"" will be the result. The government said it would study alternative plans. The Golborne Link would have branched off the the high-speed line between Crewe and Manchester and cut through Cheshire and Trafford to join the West Coast Mainline south of Wigan. HS2 Minister Andrew Stephenson said the government would now explore how HS2 trains could best get to and from Scotland. The timing of the announcement, just 30 minutes before the outcome of the confidence vote in Boris Johnson's leadership of the Conservative Party was revealed, has been criticised. In their joint statement, the three railway industry bodies said: ""It is hugely disappointing to discover that, on a day when much political attention was focused elsewhere, the government confirmed that the Golborne Link is to be removed from the HS2 project. ""Only six months ago, the Golborne Link was included in the Integrated Rail Plan, as well as the HS2 Phase 2b Bill. ""The link has been provided for in the budget for HS2 and is needed to allow adequate capacity on the national rail network to fulfil its vital function of handling the nation's longer distance movements of both passengers and freight. ""Without this connection, a bottleneck will be created north of Crewe on the West Coast Main Line, which in turn will negatively impact outcomes for passengers, decarbonisation and levelling up."" They said it was now ""absolutely essential"" for the government to ""confirm as quickly as possible how ministers intend to protect the benefits of HS2 investment. ""Such an important, strategic question of how HS2 services connect into Scotland cannot be left open or uncertain,"" the statement added. The announcement comes six months after the government dropped its plan to extend HS2 to Leeds. Construction on the Golborne Link had been due to start in the early 2030s, with the connection expected to open towards the end of that decade or in the early 2040s. Mr Stephenson said: ""HS2 is a once-in-a-lifetime project that will transform travel across the entire UK as we know it and serve millions of people for hundreds of years to come, and it's absolutely vital that we get this right from the outset. ""Removing this link is about ensuring that we've left no stone unturned when it comes to working with our Scottish counterparts to find a solution that will best serve the great people of Scotland."" Plans for the Golborne Link faced fierce criticism from MPs, councillors and local residents. Senior MP 'assured' HS2 link line will not happen Council seeks greater say in HS2 plans Cutting tram link for HS2 'would be disastrous' Leader of Warrington Council Russ Bowden said: ""We have had concerns about the Golborne Link since the idea was first proposed, and I'm therefore really pleased to see that it is now no longer part of High Speed Rail plans. ""We recognise the huge benefits HS2 will bring to the north of the country, providing Warrington with better access and transport links. ""The Golborne Link, however, has always been a deal-breaker for us. It would have had profound and unnecessary impacts on many of our communities with no discernible benefits for our town."" Gavin Newlands MP, the Scottish National Party's transport spokesman at Westminster, criticised the decision's effect on Scotland. He said: ""The original investment would have drastically improved Scotland's rail links with the north west of England, but yet again this Westminster government is tearing it apart."" Darren Caplan, chief executive of the Railway Industry Association, told BBC Radio Scotland: ""The way it's come out is a pretty negative start to it all.

"A USB Type-C charger (right) beside Apple's proprietary Lightning cable The UK government says it is not ""currently considering"" copying European Union plans for a common charging cable. The EU has provisionally agreed all new portable electronic devices must, by autumn 2024, use a USB Type-C charger, a move it says will benefit consumers. Critics say it will stifle innovation. Under the current post-Brexit arrangements, the regulation would apply to Northern Ireland, according to EU and UK officials. According to thea December 2021 parliamentary report,external, the ""new requirements may also apply to devices sold in Northern Ireland under the terms of the Northern Ireland protocol in the Brexit agreement, potentially triggering divergence of product standards with the rest of the UK"". The treaty works by keeping Northern Ireland inside the EU's single market for goods, while the rest of the UK is outside it. A row between the UK and EU about how to reform the Northern Ireland protocol remains unresolved. A UK government spokesperson said ""we are not currently considering replicating this requirement"". Apple products such as iPhones and iPads will have to conform to the new regulation, as will, eventually laptop computers. Existing devices will be exempt. The agreement will be brought before the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers after their summer recesses, where it can be formally approved and then published. Apple told the BBC it had no new comment to make. It argued against the proposal, when it was first introduced, in September 2021,with a representative telling BBC News:""Strict regulation mandating just one type of connector stifles innovation rather than encouraging it, which in turn will harm consumers in Europe and around the world"". Apple is the biggest manufacturer to use a custom charging port that is exclusive to some of its products - its iPhone series uses an Apple-made Lightning connector. The new rule will cover a range of ""small and medium-sized portable electronics"", according the EU, including: mobile phones tablets headphones and headsets handheld videogame consoles portable speakers Any of these charged using a wired cable will have to have a USB Type-C port, regardless of who makes the devices. Laptops will also have to abide by the ruling but manufacturers will have 40 months after it comes into effect to make changes. The agreement also includes a plan to let customers choose whether or not they want a charging cable with their new electronics. ""This law is a part of a broader EU effort to make products in the EU more sustainable, to reduce electronic waste, and make consumers' lives easier,""the EU said in its announcement,external. It would save consumers ""up to â¬250m [Â£213m] a year on unnecessary charger purchases"" and cut 11,000 tonnes of waste per year, the EU added.

"Heavy fighting continues in the eastern Ukrainian city of Severodonetsk, which Russian forces have been trying for weeks to capture It comes as the battle for Donbas grinds on with neither side making major gains A military analyst says the fighting in Ukraine has settled into a rhythm reminiscent of trench warfare in World War One Justin Crump says Russia appears to have slight momentum but are âlucky to capture a field in 24 hoursâ ""Stalemate is not an option"" for Ukraine, the country's president has said, as he again floated the idea of Nato membership Volodymyr Zelensky said the country had lost too many people to ""simply cede our territory"" Meanwhile, the bodies of some Ukrainian fighters killed at the Azovstal steelworks have been handed over to Kyiv, families of Ukraine's Azov unit say Edited by Chris Giles Todayâs live page was edited by Jeremy Gahagan, Alex Therrien, Marie Jackson and Chris Giles. The writers were James Fitzgerald, Sam Hancock, Alexandra FouchÃ©, Emily McGarvey and Hamzah Abbas. Join us tomorrow.   We're pausing our live coverage soon, but here's a look at the main developments in Ukraine today: There is no justification for Russia's brutal disregard of international law in Ukraine, the former German-Chancellor Angela Merkel has said in her first interview since leaving office last year. Merkel said that ""if we start going through the centuries and say which piece of territory belongs to whom, then we'll only have war - that's not possible at all"". Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky previously criticised Merkel and former French President Nicolas Sarkozy for their move to block Ukraine's admission to Nato in 2008, suggesting that it had been a clear ""miscalculation"" that emboldened Russia. Asked about rejecting Ukraine's Nato membership back then, Merkel said that if she hadn't have vetoed the move, ""Putin would do something that would not be good for Ukraine"". The World Bank has downgraded its estimate for global economic growth to 2.9% because of the conflict in Ukraine, which along with other factors, has caused a severe downturn. ""Global growth is expected to slump from 5.7% in 2021 to 2.9% in 2022 - significantly lower than 4.1% that was anticipated in January,""it said in its Global Economic Prospects report,external. ""The world economy is expected to experience its sharpest deceleration following an initial recovery from global recession in more than 80 years,"" it added. Global economic growth had recovered to 5.7% last year following the downturn caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. ""The war in Ukraine, lockdowns in China, supply-chain disruptions, and the risk of stagflation are hammering growth. For many countries, recession will be hard to avoid,"" said the bank's president, David Malpass.  The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, after attacks in March The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency - the UN's nuclear watchdog - has dismissed as absurd allegations by Ukraine's nuclear operator that he had lied about being invited to visit a Russian-occupied nuclear power plant there. Rafael Grossi has been trying to visit the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant - Europe's largest - which Russian forces took control of in early March. But Ukraine's nuclear operator has said a visit by the watchdog would legitimise Russia's occupation of the plant. Speaking to the BBC's Newshour, Grossi said there was a contractual obligation to allow safety inspections by his organisation. ""The government have requested us to do this. There have been statements, I believe even today, implying that... I am lying when I say this."" He added that it was not ""an invitation that can or can't be extended"", but ""an obligation"" as there is a lot of nuclear material at the plant which has not been inspected, leading to an ""abnormal"" and ""unsustainable"" situation. There is no suggestion that the Ukrainian government has accused Grossi of lying, though the country's nuclear operator, Energoatom, says that Ukraine has not invited him to visit. As we've been reporting, heavy fighting is continuing in the eastern Ukrainian city of Severodonetsk, which Russian forces have been trying to capture for weeks. Now, officials say Ukrainian forces are finding it hard to
stave off Russian attacks in the centre of Severodonetsk but
Russia has still not taken control of the city, according to Luhansk regional governor Serhiy Haidai. Earlier, the city's mayor, Oleksandr Stryuk warned thatRussia was aiming to capture the city with more troops, and said that Severdonetsk's armed forces have ""strengthened their positions and are holding the line"". Russian troops
were constantly shelling its twin city Lysychansk, and Moscow's forces were deliberately targeting areas where civilians were hiding, Haidai said on the Telegram messaging app. He reiterated a call for long-range artillery to be sent to Ukraine to enable its troops to repel the Russians in the region. Anna Melnichuk, the deputy leader of Konstantinovka city council, has been outlining the problems faced in her city and neighbouring areas. She told the BBC that while the city, north of Donetsk, is being protected by the Ukrainian army, conditions are difficult. ""We have some problems with gas, and water as well."" She added that the government and local council were in touch with organisations which were providing food, but deliveries by car were difficult due to problems with petrol. When asked about the conditions in Severodonetsk, where fighting continues, Melnichuk said: ""Yes, the situation is truly difficult, but not just because of war actions, but because of problems with water, with food, with electricity."" About 300 Ukrainian civilians, mostly journalists and public activists, are being kept in improvised prisons in Kherson, and 300 more in other occupied settlements in the Kherson region, according to the Ukrainian president's envoy for Crimea, Tamila Tasheva. Tasheva said there are about 600 people in the region who are ""actually hostages and are being held in specially equipped basements, actually jails,"" Interfax news agency reported. ""They are kept in inhumane conditions and tortured. Witnesses report cries that could be heard from the places were our citizens are subjected to such illegal actions,"" she told a news briefing. She said some civilians are being moved from the Kherson region to Crimea and being kept as ""civilian hostages and prisoners of war"". ""Some people who left Mariupol were detained during filtration on the administrative border with Crimea and were taken to the Simferopol remand centre,"" she said. If you are just joining us, or looking for a recap, here's a round-up of the latest events in Ukraine:  British troops in World War One going up the line to their trenches The conflict in parts of Ukraine has been described asreminiscent of the trench warfare used in World War I- but what is meant by the term? Trenches are ditches dug into the ground that offer shelter and protection against enemy fire and means both sides sacrifice mobility in order to gain protection. During World War I, trenches were developed from simple ditches into more complex systems, with a front line, known as the fire trench, the second line, known as the support trench, and a third line, known as the reserve trench. These trenches were connected by communication trenches, which allowed men to run between lines, without ever having to go over open ground. The BBC has previously been granted access to trenches being used by the Ukrainian army. The soldiers working and living in them told the BBC that they are sleeping and eating in them, while building new ones every day. This video can not be played Ukraine war: Inside Kyiv's trench defences Joe InwoodReporting from Kyiv There had been much speculation about what had happened to Aiden Aslin and Shaun Pinner,two British men captured fighting in the Ukrainian port city of Mariupol. Footage of Aslin shortly after his capture - his face bloodied and bruised, being interviewed by a Russian propaganda channel - led many to fear for his wellbeing. Now we know both men are alive and are being held in the occupied Donestsk Peopleâs Republic, after a video appeared of them standing in what appears to be a court. Standing alongside a third man, Moroccan national Saaudun Brahim, the pair spoke only to confirm they knew the charges against them and were happy for their case to proceed without the evidence of witnesses. Both were able to stand unaided and seemed aware of their surroundings. According to the Interfax news agency, the leader of the self-proclaimed DNR, Denis Pushilin, has said they will be charged in the âSupreme Courtâ of the region, which is not recognised internationally. The British pair are facing several âchargesâ, including violent seizure of power, acting as mercenaries and undergoing training to carry out terrorist activities. It is feared the court, which is not internationally recognised, could give them the death penalty if it finds them guilty. Russia's parliament has passed two bills ending theEuropean Court of Human Rightsâ jurisdictionin Russia, after it announced it would exit the court in March amid the conflict in Ukraine. The ECHR aims to apply and protect the civil and political rights of the continent's citizens, and this previously provided a way to pursue legal and human rights cases against Russia that had either been rejected or ignored by Russian courts. One of the bills removes Russia from the court's jurisdiction and the second bill sets 15 March as the cut-off point, meaning rulings against Russia made after that date are not to be implemented, the RIA Novosti news agency reports. The Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe expelled Russia from the organisation on 15 March, which the ECHR is part of, in response to Russiaâs invasion of Ukraine. Russia has said that it independently decided to leave the Council of Europe, with former President Dmitry Medvedev saying that Russiaâs exit from the organisation represented an opportunity to restore the death penalty, which the Council of Europeanâs rules prohibit. A Russian journalist who was fined and released after she protested against the war in Ukraine on a live TV news programme earlier this year says she feels Ukrainian and will change her surname as a sign of support. Marina Ovsyannikova - who says her father is Ukrainian - announced the movein a post on Facebook,external. ""I'm not a 'good Russian', I'm Ukrainian. As a sign of support of Ukraine, I intend to change the surname of Ovsyannikov to the native Tkachuk."" Formerly an editor at Russian state-controlled Channel One,she was shortly detained in Marchin Russia after she ran on to the set of the channel holding a sign saying ""no war"". She has since emigrated to Germany. James WaterhouseReporting from Kyiv âVery happyâ were two of the words President Volodymyr Zelensky used in reaction to UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson surviving his vote of confidence, describing him as a âtrue friend of Ukraineâ. Itâs a sentiment echoed by many on the cobbled streets of central Kyiv, mainly because the UK government is one of the biggest supporters of the country in this war, outside the European Union and United States. Of course, peopleâs views of the British prime minister arenât shaped by domestic issues. Even before this invasion, though, Ukrainians cared deeply about the level of military aid being supplied by western allies as Russia continued to gather troops on the border. They are continuing to defend, but Russia has already taken a fifth of Ukrainian territory. As we reported earlier, military analyst Justin Crump has said conflict in parts of Ukraine is nowreminiscent of the trench warfare seen in World War One. Here's a selection of images capturing life for Ukrainian troops in trench positions on the frontline: Soldiers walk in trenches to take cover for Russian artillery strikes at an undisclosed defence position on the outskirts of the separatist region of Donetsk Ukrainian troops walk along a trench at a position on the frontline near Bakhmut in Ukraine's Donbas region Ukraine's army appears to have an advantage in any given battle at the moment because they are generally defending rather than attacking, according to military analyst Justin Crump A Ukrainian servicewoman looks out of a trench at a position near a frontline in the Donetsk region Parts of Ukraine have been taken back to the trench-filled warfare of decades ago Earlier, we reported on the fighting in Severodonetsk and Lysychansk. President Zelensky called them ""dead cities"" and now Severodonetsk's Mayor, Oleksandr Stryuk, has been speaking to Ukrainian TV about the current situation.He warned that Russia is aiming to capture the city with more troops, and said that Severdonetsk's armed forces have ""strengthened their positions and are holding the line"". An update from the Ukrainian armed forces earlier today also suggested that there were further Russian troops in the area. It has not yet been possible for the BBC to verify exact details of the fighting. Danny AeberhardEurope Regional Editor, BBC World Service As we've been reporting, Ukraine's national nuclear operator has accused the head of the UN nuclear watchdog, IAEA, of lying about being invited by Ukraine to visit the Russian-occupied nuclear plant at Zaporizhzhia. The IAEA's director general, Rafael Grossi, insisted on Monday that such a visit would take place, ideally sooner rather than later, citing fears over nuclear security at the plant Ukraine's nuclear operator, Energoatom, did not mince its words. In a statement, it said it saw efforts by Grossi to visit the Zaporizhzhia plant as an attempt to legitimise Russia's occupation of the facility. It said Ukraine had not invited him to visit, and had refused permission previously. Energoatom also blamed Russia for blocking the transfer of crucial data from the plant to the IAEA. Grossi - in an impassioned address on Monday - stressed a visit was vital, saying the Zaporizhzhia plant was disconnected from safety systems. Russian forcestook over the plant- Europe's largest - at the start of the conflict. Russian forces now control almost all of Ukraine's easternmost region, the Russian defence minister says. 97% of Luhansk Oblast has been ""liberated"", Sergei Shoigu told a meeting of the defence ministry, broadcast on state TV. Shoigu claims that residential areas of the flashpoint city of Severodonetsk are in Moscow's hands, and further attempts are being made to gain industrial areas. It was not possible for the BBC to independently verify the claims. There have been conflicting accounts of which army controls which territory as battles for the city continue. James FitzGeraldBBC News Russia could look to make 'micro-scale' gains in Kharkiv, says an expert Fighting
in Ukraine has settled into a rhythm reminiscent of trench warfare in World War One, says a military analyst. Justin
Crump, chief executive of security consultancy Sibylline, tells the BBC the
conflict has become âmicro-levelâ - with Russia now âlucky to capture a field
in 24 hoursâ. This is because the defending army appears to have an advantage
in any given battle at the moment. In some
places, that favours Ukrainians holding onto their territory; in others, it
suits Russian troops occupying cities theyâve captured. Crump, a
former British Army serviceman, says Russia appears to have slight momentum â
as its troops âgrind forwardâ. Moscow will want to capture Severodonetsk and
then the remainder of the eastern Donbas region in order to declare âany sort
of victoryâ. He expects
the Kremlin to set its sights Zaporizhzhia next, then make a fresh attempt at Kharkiv and look to capture Odesa on the south coast. Russiaâs
brand of attritional warfare has been seen to work, Crump says â but ânothing
is inevitableâ about what happens next. âRussiaâs
got to be able to keep paying the bill,â he says â referring to the
expense of the war, as well as the human toll. As a
result of poor tactics and other shortcomings, Russia has also shown that it
can only attack successfully on a single axis at a time, Crump claims. From the
Ukrainian perspective, high-spec weapons donations from Western nations â such as
missile-launchers recently promised by the US and UK â are no âsilver bulletâ,
says Crump, because the conflict has become less precise than that. He says
there is also the question of how long Western countries keep up their support
for Ukraine. But
Russia âcanât leave the frontline where it isâ, he adds â suggesting that
Ukraine will refuse to give up the territories currently in the hands of its
enemy. There is,
therefore, the possibility of a âfrozen conflict at bestâ. The Azovstal steelwork was for weeks under relentless Russian shelling We reported earlierthat the bodies of some Ukrainian fighters killed defending the key southern port of Mariupol from Russian forces at the Azovstal steel plant have been handed over to Kyiv. The fighters' families have said this was part of a prisoner exchange with Russia, with each side receiving 160 bodies. Of those on the Ukrainian side, more than 50 bodies were members of the Azov regiment, the families said on the Telegram messenging service. The identification process is continuing. The families added that talks are ongoing on further prisoner swaps, without giving any further details. More than 2,500 Azovstal defenders - which also include border guards, police and territorial defence - are currently being held by Russia, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said earlier. Kyiv is seeking the handover of them all, but several leading Russian lawmakers are demanding that some of the soldiers - specifically from the Azov regiment - should be put on trial. The regiment was set up in 2014, with some of its members initially linked to far-right groups. Russia describes Azov regiment fighters as neo-Nazis - a claim denied by Ukraine, who says the unit has been reformed and is outside politics. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Douglas Ross has performed two U-turns over Boris Johnson's premiership Boris Johnson was never Douglas Ross's first choice to be UK Conservative leader but he did back him in the 2019 contest to replace Theresa May. He has not said whether he now regrets that decision but he has certainly changed his mind about him. More than once. In January,Mr Ross withdrew his support for Boris Johnsonsaying his position had become ""untenable"" over lockdown parties and calling for a confidence vote. He then reversed that positionwhen the war in Ukraine started, arguing that political upheaval at home would play into the hands of Vladimir Putin. That no longer seems to be of primary concern, Mr Ross having now completed a double U-turn by voting for the motion of no confidence in Boris Johnson's leadership. In a statement, he said that while the timing of the vote was not ideal, he had listened to public anger over Partygate and could not in ""good faith"" continue to back the PM. That decision brings him into line with the bulk of his Tory colleagues at Holyrood, but his numerous changes in position have raised questions about his own leadership capabilities. PM vote: Scottish Secretary says time to move on PM wins vote but suffers large Tory rebellion As one pro-Johnson MP put it, he would be reluctant to be driven anywhere by Douglas Ross for fear of not knowing where the journey might end! The reality is that, given his flip-flopping form, the Scottish Tory leader would have faced criticism and embarrassment whichever way he'd voted. Either for backing a law-breaking PM that the Scottish party has blamed for heavy losses in the recent local elections or - as it turns out - for abandoning him despite having insisted he should continue to lead the UK through the Ukraine crisis. Mr Ross was one of the 148 Tory MPs who expressed no confidence and among four of the six Tories with Westminster seats in Scotland to take that position. The Scottish rebels are fairly unusual in that they have all publicly declared how they voted in what was a secret ballot. Alister Jack continues to stand behind Boris Johnson The MP John Lamont quit as an aide to the foreign secretary, Liz Truss, after he cast his vote against the PM. It's not clear if former Scottish Secretary David Mundell (who was dumped from Cabinet by Mr Johnson) will be able to continue as a trade envoy to New Zealand after his rebellion. MP Andrew Bowie - the fourth Scottish Tory MP refusing to back the PM - stepped down from his role as a vice-chair of the UK Conservative party some time ago. This rift between MPs and their leader is not sustainable. It's hard to imagine, for example, a UK general election campaign with key Scottish Tories unable to endorse their own candidate for Number 10. On the other side of the argument - still standing by their leader - MPs David Duguid and Alister Jack, who sits in Cabinet as Scottish secretary. In a statement, Mr Jack said the PM's 211 votes represented a ""clear majority"" and that it was time to move on from Partygate and ""get on with what really matters"". That may be wishful thinking on his part because having won the vote, Boris Johnson has also publicly lost the confidence of two fifths of his own MPs. That's a worse result than his predecessor Theresa May got and she was forced to resign six months later. It's not certain Boris Johnson will suffer the same fate, but nor is it certain that he will be able to govern effectively in the months ahead. The trouble with rebellion is it can be habit-forming and if only a few dozen Tory MPs switch sides in certain Commons votes, the government loses. Even the threat of that could divert ministers from their course. There is the potential for further trouble in Conservative ranks if the party suffers defeat in the forthcoming by-elections in Wakefield and in Tiverton and Honiton - which certainly look difficult for the Tories. A privileges committee inquiry examining whether or not Boris Johnson knowingly misled parliament over Partygate is another potential flashpoint. That does not mean the PM - protected as he is from another confidence vote for a year - is without agency. He has the power to reset policy in an effort to renew his appeal to Tory MPs and the wider public. He is expected to bring forward new measures to cut childcare costs and help more people onto the housing ladder in the coming days. Some have speculated that raising the prospect of an early general election might help him concentrate minds. It is to his advantage that his critics currently lack an obvious candidate to replace him as Tory leader and PM. Having won the confidence vote, Boris Johnson's premiership continues but with reduced authority which, as previous prime ministers have found, is not easy to regain.

"At first glance they are an unlikely line up for aid workers in a war zone - a dog trainer from Kent, a farmer from Cornwall, and a technology executive from Sussex. But these three British volunteers were drawn - separately - to Ukraine. They teamed up here and have spent months in harm's way evacuating the elderly and the frail from areas near front lines.  They fund themselves and prefer not to be named. ""I know my parents worry,"" says the dog trainer who, at 21, is the youngest. ""I have had phone calls with my mum where she has been in tears, but they are just really proud of what I am doing. They know I will be out here for a while, and they don't know when I will be coming home."" As we speak, air raid sirens wail and explosions thud in the distance now and then. She hopes one day to be a qualified paramedic. For now, she has done a course in trauma first aid, and is learning on the job. When we joined the volunteers for a day, she was quick to check the lower leg of an evacuee with a blackened, gangrenous wound.  Medical care had already been arranged for him at a safe distance. The team regularly travel to and from towns and cities in the path of Russian forces who are grinding forward across the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine. Shelling is a constant threat. One run was so risky they were ordered by the Ukrainian military to put their body armour on. 'I know my parents worry': the 21-year-old has put her life on hold ""There have been a few moments when you feel it's a bit close for comfort,"" she says. ""We stick together. As much danger as we are in, we feel quite prepared and reliable as a team."" They concede that some may wonder what they are doing in this war-torn region, and how much help they can provide. ""I didn't expect that we would be needed or wanted,"" says the farmer, ""but we are.""  Back in the UK he was tending to cattle and sheep before losing his job.  After Russia invaded Ukraine, he filled a van with aid and drove it over from the UK.  It now serves as their rough and ready ambulance. ""In an ideal world we would be redundant,"" he says, ""but we are not. We are here doing what we can. We are not experts, but we've done a lot in the last few months. I don't feel like there's anything else I could be doing that's more important than this."" He was behind the wheel on the day of our visit, but the volunteers stress they share the load, and the highs and lows, buoying each other up with ""British humour"". 96-year-old Anastacia, one of the many people the three volunteers have helped They have moved about 150 people in recent months - some to hospital in the city of Kramatorsk, others to a train station in the Pokrovsk. They collaborate with an established Ukrainian NGO, Vostok SOS, which gives them lists of evacuees to be collected each day, along with information about their medical condition. As they grapple with day-to-day logistics and shifting front lines, the team has another concern - that international attention is fading. ""Aid is coming in slower,"" says the former farmer. ""That leads me to believe that people are becoming kind of used to the war, and I think that's something that really should not be happening."" 'Aid is coming in slower,' says the former farmer And he warns that there are still many in dire need of evacuation. ""Many people think those who needed to get out have gotten out,"" he says. ""That isn't the case."" The third member of the team was already in motion when the war broke out. She had spent six months travelling in the Middle East, after leaving her role working in technology in a start-up. ""My life infrastructure had already been put on pause,"" she tells me. ""So I've been free to come out here and stay out here indefinitely. We just want to get things done without any bureaucracy, any red tape. We work every day because this is what we care about. This is what matters because we are all Europeans. An attack on Ukraine by Russia is attack on all of us."" Her own family knows the trauma of war and dislocation. Her grandmother had to flee from Poland during World War Two. And when the team collect a 96-year old called Anastacia, she tenderly holds her hand.  Anastasia is painfully frail and has to be lifted with care.  Her 70-year-old son Yevgeny tells us they spent days below ground when their village was shelled. ""Four or five days ago they started firing with mortars,"" he says. ""Our garden was hit, just 10 metres from our house.  When it was so loud that everything shook, my mother was very scared."" The former technology worker came to Ukraine from the Middle East Anastasia is carefully carried on to a train, with Yevgeny by her side. Once again she has to flee, just as she did at 15, during World War Two. The volunteer - who is now a world away from her old life in high tech - says the hardest days are when they cannot evacuate everyone. Some don't want to go - reluctant to leave home and hearth even when the war is closing in. ""You hope that you're doing the right thing taking them away from their land, and that they will get to come home. But you don't know. And you think about that for every single person you evacuate. Will they get to come back?"" Her voice catches with emotion. ""The land here is beautiful,"" she tells me.  ""And I was told that if you take a Ukrainian away from that, they will die. Whenever I evacuate a woman, I will pick her a flower from outside her building to take away. That's the only thing I can do.""

"Heavy fighting continues in the eastern Ukrainian city of Severodonetsk, which Russian forces have been trying for weeks to capture It comes as the battle for Donbas grinds on with neither side making major gains A military analyst says the fighting in Ukraine has settled into a rhythm reminiscent of trench warfare in World War One Justin Crump says Russia appears to have slight momentum but are âlucky to capture a field in 24 hoursâ ""Stalemate is not an option"" for Ukraine, the country's president has said, as he again floated the idea of Nato membership Volodymyr Zelensky said the country had lost too many people to ""simply cede our territory"" Meanwhile, the bodies of some Ukrainian fighters killed at the Azovstal steelworks have been handed over to Kyiv, families of Ukraine's Azov unit say Edited by Chris Giles Todayâs live page was edited by Jeremy Gahagan, Alex Therrien, Marie Jackson and Chris Giles. The writers were James Fitzgerald, Sam Hancock, Alexandra FouchÃ©, Emily McGarvey and Hamzah Abbas. Join us tomorrow.   We're pausing our live coverage soon, but here's a look at the main developments in Ukraine today: There is no justification for Russia's brutal disregard of international law in Ukraine, the former German-Chancellor Angela Merkel has said in her first interview since leaving office last year. Merkel said that ""if we start going through the centuries and say which piece of territory belongs to whom, then we'll only have war - that's not possible at all"". Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky previously criticised Merkel and former French President Nicolas Sarkozy for their move to block Ukraine's admission to Nato in 2008, suggesting that it had been a clear ""miscalculation"" that emboldened Russia. Asked about rejecting Ukraine's Nato membership back then, Merkel said that if she hadn't have vetoed the move, ""Putin would do something that would not be good for Ukraine"". The World Bank has downgraded its estimate for global economic growth to 2.9% because of the conflict in Ukraine, which along with other factors, has caused a severe downturn. ""Global growth is expected to slump from 5.7% in 2021 to 2.9% in 2022 - significantly lower than 4.1% that was anticipated in January,""it said in its Global Economic Prospects report,external. ""The world economy is expected to experience its sharpest deceleration following an initial recovery from global recession in more than 80 years,"" it added. Global economic growth had recovered to 5.7% last year following the downturn caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. ""The war in Ukraine, lockdowns in China, supply-chain disruptions, and the risk of stagflation are hammering growth. For many countries, recession will be hard to avoid,"" said the bank's president, David Malpass.  The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, after attacks in March The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency - the UN's nuclear watchdog - has dismissed as absurd allegations by Ukraine's nuclear operator that he had lied about being invited to visit a Russian-occupied nuclear power plant there. Rafael Grossi has been trying to visit the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant - Europe's largest - which Russian forces took control of in early March. But Ukraine's nuclear operator has said a visit by the watchdog would legitimise Russia's occupation of the plant. Speaking to the BBC's Newshour, Grossi said there was a contractual obligation to allow safety inspections by his organisation. ""The government have requested us to do this. There have been statements, I believe even today, implying that... I am lying when I say this."" He added that it was not ""an invitation that can or can't be extended"", but ""an obligation"" as there is a lot of nuclear material at the plant which has not been inspected, leading to an ""abnormal"" and ""unsustainable"" situation. There is no suggestion that the Ukrainian government has accused Grossi of lying, though the country's nuclear operator, Energoatom, says that Ukraine has not invited him to visit. As we've been reporting, heavy fighting is continuing in the eastern Ukrainian city of Severodonetsk, which Russian forces have been trying to capture for weeks. Now, officials say Ukrainian forces are finding it hard to
stave off Russian attacks in the centre of Severodonetsk but
Russia has still not taken control of the city, according to Luhansk regional governor Serhiy Haidai. Earlier, the city's mayor, Oleksandr Stryuk warned thatRussia was aiming to capture the city with more troops, and said that Severdonetsk's armed forces have ""strengthened their positions and are holding the line"". Russian troops
were constantly shelling its twin city Lysychansk, and Moscow's forces were deliberately targeting areas where civilians were hiding, Haidai said on the Telegram messaging app. He reiterated a call for long-range artillery to be sent to Ukraine to enable its troops to repel the Russians in the region. Anna Melnichuk, the deputy leader of Konstantinovka city council, has been outlining the problems faced in her city and neighbouring areas. She told the BBC that while the city, north of Donetsk, is being protected by the Ukrainian army, conditions are difficult. ""We have some problems with gas, and water as well."" She added that the government and local council were in touch with organisations which were providing food, but deliveries by car were difficult due to problems with petrol. When asked about the conditions in Severodonetsk, where fighting continues, Melnichuk said: ""Yes, the situation is truly difficult, but not just because of war actions, but because of problems with water, with food, with electricity."" About 300 Ukrainian civilians, mostly journalists and public activists, are being kept in improvised prisons in Kherson, and 300 more in other occupied settlements in the Kherson region, according to the Ukrainian president's envoy for Crimea, Tamila Tasheva. Tasheva said there are about 600 people in the region who are ""actually hostages and are being held in specially equipped basements, actually jails,"" Interfax news agency reported. ""They are kept in inhumane conditions and tortured. Witnesses report cries that could be heard from the places were our citizens are subjected to such illegal actions,"" she told a news briefing. She said some civilians are being moved from the Kherson region to Crimea and being kept as ""civilian hostages and prisoners of war"". ""Some people who left Mariupol were detained during filtration on the administrative border with Crimea and were taken to the Simferopol remand centre,"" she said. If you are just joining us, or looking for a recap, here's a round-up of the latest events in Ukraine:  British troops in World War One going up the line to their trenches The conflict in parts of Ukraine has been described asreminiscent of the trench warfare used in World War I- but what is meant by the term? Trenches are ditches dug into the ground that offer shelter and protection against enemy fire and means both sides sacrifice mobility in order to gain protection. During World War I, trenches were developed from simple ditches into more complex systems, with a front line, known as the fire trench, the second line, known as the support trench, and a third line, known as the reserve trench. These trenches were connected by communication trenches, which allowed men to run between lines, without ever having to go over open ground. The BBC has previously been granted access to trenches being used by the Ukrainian army. The soldiers working and living in them told the BBC that they are sleeping and eating in them, while building new ones every day. This video can not be played Ukraine war: Inside Kyiv's trench defences Joe InwoodReporting from Kyiv There had been much speculation about what had happened to Aiden Aslin and Shaun Pinner,two British men captured fighting in the Ukrainian port city of Mariupol. Footage of Aslin shortly after his capture - his face bloodied and bruised, being interviewed by a Russian propaganda channel - led many to fear for his wellbeing. Now we know both men are alive and are being held in the occupied Donestsk Peopleâs Republic, after a video appeared of them standing in what appears to be a court. Standing alongside a third man, Moroccan national Saaudun Brahim, the pair spoke only to confirm they knew the charges against them and were happy for their case to proceed without the evidence of witnesses. Both were able to stand unaided and seemed aware of their surroundings. According to the Interfax news agency, the leader of the self-proclaimed DNR, Denis Pushilin, has said they will be charged in the âSupreme Courtâ of the region, which is not recognised internationally. The British pair are facing several âchargesâ, including violent seizure of power, acting as mercenaries and undergoing training to carry out terrorist activities. It is feared the court, which is not internationally recognised, could give them the death penalty if it finds them guilty. Russia's parliament has passed two bills ending theEuropean Court of Human Rightsâ jurisdictionin Russia, after it announced it would exit the court in March amid the conflict in Ukraine. The ECHR aims to apply and protect the civil and political rights of the continent's citizens, and this previously provided a way to pursue legal and human rights cases against Russia that had either been rejected or ignored by Russian courts. One of the bills removes Russia from the court's jurisdiction and the second bill sets 15 March as the cut-off point, meaning rulings against Russia made after that date are not to be implemented, the RIA Novosti news agency reports. The Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe expelled Russia from the organisation on 15 March, which the ECHR is part of, in response to Russiaâs invasion of Ukraine. Russia has said that it independently decided to leave the Council of Europe, with former President Dmitry Medvedev saying that Russiaâs exit from the organisation represented an opportunity to restore the death penalty, which the Council of Europeanâs rules prohibit. A Russian journalist who was fined and released after she protested against the war in Ukraine on a live TV news programme earlier this year says she feels Ukrainian and will change her surname as a sign of support. Marina Ovsyannikova - who says her father is Ukrainian - announced the movein a post on Facebook,external. ""I'm not a 'good Russian', I'm Ukrainian. As a sign of support of Ukraine, I intend to change the surname of Ovsyannikov to the native Tkachuk."" Formerly an editor at Russian state-controlled Channel One,she was shortly detained in Marchin Russia after she ran on to the set of the channel holding a sign saying ""no war"". She has since emigrated to Germany. James WaterhouseReporting from Kyiv âVery happyâ were two of the words President Volodymyr Zelensky used in reaction to UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson surviving his vote of confidence, describing him as a âtrue friend of Ukraineâ. Itâs a sentiment echoed by many on the cobbled streets of central Kyiv, mainly because the UK government is one of the biggest supporters of the country in this war, outside the European Union and United States. Of course, peopleâs views of the British prime minister arenât shaped by domestic issues. Even before this invasion, though, Ukrainians cared deeply about the level of military aid being supplied by western allies as Russia continued to gather troops on the border. They are continuing to defend, but Russia has already taken a fifth of Ukrainian territory. As we reported earlier, military analyst Justin Crump has said conflict in parts of Ukraine is nowreminiscent of the trench warfare seen in World War One. Here's a selection of images capturing life for Ukrainian troops in trench positions on the frontline: Soldiers walk in trenches to take cover for Russian artillery strikes at an undisclosed defence position on the outskirts of the separatist region of Donetsk Ukrainian troops walk along a trench at a position on the frontline near Bakhmut in Ukraine's Donbas region Ukraine's army appears to have an advantage in any given battle at the moment because they are generally defending rather than attacking, according to military analyst Justin Crump A Ukrainian servicewoman looks out of a trench at a position near a frontline in the Donetsk region Parts of Ukraine have been taken back to the trench-filled warfare of decades ago Earlier, we reported on the fighting in Severodonetsk and Lysychansk. President Zelensky called them ""dead cities"" and now Severodonetsk's Mayor, Oleksandr Stryuk, has been speaking to Ukrainian TV about the current situation.He warned that Russia is aiming to capture the city with more troops, and said that Severdonetsk's armed forces have ""strengthened their positions and are holding the line"". An update from the Ukrainian armed forces earlier today also suggested that there were further Russian troops in the area. It has not yet been possible for the BBC to verify exact details of the fighting. Danny AeberhardEurope Regional Editor, BBC World Service As we've been reporting, Ukraine's national nuclear operator has accused the head of the UN nuclear watchdog, IAEA, of lying about being invited by Ukraine to visit the Russian-occupied nuclear plant at Zaporizhzhia. The IAEA's director general, Rafael Grossi, insisted on Monday that such a visit would take place, ideally sooner rather than later, citing fears over nuclear security at the plant Ukraine's nuclear operator, Energoatom, did not mince its words. In a statement, it said it saw efforts by Grossi to visit the Zaporizhzhia plant as an attempt to legitimise Russia's occupation of the facility. It said Ukraine had not invited him to visit, and had refused permission previously. Energoatom also blamed Russia for blocking the transfer of crucial data from the plant to the IAEA. Grossi - in an impassioned address on Monday - stressed a visit was vital, saying the Zaporizhzhia plant was disconnected from safety systems. Russian forcestook over the plant- Europe's largest - at the start of the conflict. Russian forces now control almost all of Ukraine's easternmost region, the Russian defence minister says. 97% of Luhansk Oblast has been ""liberated"", Sergei Shoigu told a meeting of the defence ministry, broadcast on state TV. Shoigu claims that residential areas of the flashpoint city of Severodonetsk are in Moscow's hands, and further attempts are being made to gain industrial areas. It was not possible for the BBC to independently verify the claims. There have been conflicting accounts of which army controls which territory as battles for the city continue. James FitzGeraldBBC News Russia could look to make 'micro-scale' gains in Kharkiv, says an expert Fighting
in Ukraine has settled into a rhythm reminiscent of trench warfare in World War One, says a military analyst. Justin
Crump, chief executive of security consultancy Sibylline, tells the BBC the
conflict has become âmicro-levelâ - with Russia now âlucky to capture a field
in 24 hoursâ. This is because the defending army appears to have an advantage
in any given battle at the moment. In some
places, that favours Ukrainians holding onto their territory; in others, it
suits Russian troops occupying cities theyâve captured. Crump, a
former British Army serviceman, says Russia appears to have slight momentum â
as its troops âgrind forwardâ. Moscow will want to capture Severodonetsk and
then the remainder of the eastern Donbas region in order to declare âany sort
of victoryâ. He expects
the Kremlin to set its sights Zaporizhzhia next, then make a fresh attempt at Kharkiv and look to capture Odesa on the south coast. Russiaâs
brand of attritional warfare has been seen to work, Crump says â but ânothing
is inevitableâ about what happens next. âRussiaâs
got to be able to keep paying the bill,â he says â referring to the
expense of the war, as well as the human toll. As a
result of poor tactics and other shortcomings, Russia has also shown that it
can only attack successfully on a single axis at a time, Crump claims. From the
Ukrainian perspective, high-spec weapons donations from Western nations â such as
missile-launchers recently promised by the US and UK â are no âsilver bulletâ,
says Crump, because the conflict has become less precise than that. He says
there is also the question of how long Western countries keep up their support
for Ukraine. But
Russia âcanât leave the frontline where it isâ, he adds â suggesting that
Ukraine will refuse to give up the territories currently in the hands of its
enemy. There is,
therefore, the possibility of a âfrozen conflict at bestâ. The Azovstal steelwork was for weeks under relentless Russian shelling We reported earlierthat the bodies of some Ukrainian fighters killed defending the key southern port of Mariupol from Russian forces at the Azovstal steel plant have been handed over to Kyiv. The fighters' families have said this was part of a prisoner exchange with Russia, with each side receiving 160 bodies. Of those on the Ukrainian side, more than 50 bodies were members of the Azov regiment, the families said on the Telegram messenging service. The identification process is continuing. The families added that talks are ongoing on further prisoner swaps, without giving any further details. More than 2,500 Azovstal defenders - which also include border guards, police and territorial defence - are currently being held by Russia, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said earlier. Kyiv is seeking the handover of them all, but several leading Russian lawmakers are demanding that some of the soldiers - specifically from the Azov regiment - should be put on trial. The regiment was set up in 2014, with some of its members initially linked to far-right groups. Russia describes Azov regiment fighters as neo-Nazis - a claim denied by Ukraine, who says the unit has been reformed and is outside politics. Â© 2025 BBC.

"This video can not be played Volodymyr Zelensky says he is ""very happy"" Boris Johnson remains UK prime minister Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said he was ""very happy"" Boris Johnson was still UK prime minister after he survived an attempt to oust him. Mr Johnson won a confidence vote despite a major revolt that saw 148 of his own Tory MPs vote to remove him. ""I'm glad we haven't lost an important ally, this is great news,"" Mr Zelensky said at an online event. Mr Johnson has forged a close relationship with President Zelensky since Russia's invasion of Ukraine. He called Mr Johnson a ""true friend of Ukraine"" and a ""concrete"" supporter in an interview at a virtual conference hosted by the Financial Times on Tuesday. The UK was among the first to provide weapons to support Ukraine's defence and - like its Western allies - has imposed sweeping sanctions on Russian targets prosecuting the war. In April, Mr Johnson pledged ""unwavering support"" ona visit to the capital Kyiv, where he did an unannounced walkabout of the city with President Zelensky. This video can not be played Watch: Boris Johnson and Volodymyr Zelensky tour Kyiv's near-empty streets Mr Johnson has faced a backlash from MPs and the public after he was fined by police for breaking his own lockdown laws at a 2020 party in Downing Street, where the prime minister lives and works. A report by a senior civil servant criticised failures of leadership in Downing Street, where officials and staff were issued with a total of 123 fines for breaking Covid rules on indoor gatherings during the pandemic. Some Conservative MPs had cited the war in Ukraine as a reason not to oust Mr Johnson from office in the confidence vote in Parliament on Monday. Rallying his MPs ahead of the vote, Mr Johnson said it was the wrong time for ""unforced domestic political drama"" when Ukraine was fighting Russian President Vladimir Putin's forces. Mr Johnson won the backing of 59% of his MPs, describing the result as ""extremely good, positive, conclusive"" and insisting his leadership was now secure.

Chris Mason: PM's opponents are not defeated However, those who had voted against Mr Johnson said the scale of the rebellion had weakened his authority, with some calling on him to resign. Reacting to Monday night's result, cabinet minister Nadhim Zahawi said he thought President Zelensky would be ""punching the air because he knows his great ally Boris Johnson will be prime minister tomorrow morning"". Those comments were criticised by some MPs, includingLabour's Karl Turner,external, who urged Mr Zahawi to apologise for dragging the Ukrainian president ""into this Tory party civil war"". On Monday, ahead of the confidence vote, Mr Johnson called Mr Zelensky to discuss Ukraine's defence of its eastern Donbas region, where Russian forces are advancing. In a tweet,external, Mr Johnson wrote: ""We're unwavering in our mission of ensuring Ukraine is defended and supported for the long-term."" The UK's military support to Ukraine amounts to Â£750m so far and includes thousands of anti-tank missiles, 20 armoured vehicles, 4.5 tonnes of plastic explosives, and electronic warfare kit. On top of this,the UK says,externalit is providing Â£220m of humanitarian assistance to Ukraine. As a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP), the UK was the sixth largest donor of aid to Ukraine globally between January and May,according to research by the Kiel Institute for the World Economy,external. Last month, the UK government said it would offer further aid and military support to Ukraine worth Â£1.3bn to boost the country's defence against Russia. Mr Johnson spoke to President Zelensky on the phone ahead of the confidence vote on Monday Ukrainian commentators and officials expressed relief that Mr Johnson had won Monday's confidence vote, with some noting that UK had become a key arms supplier for the country. Mykhaylo Podolyak, one of Mr Zelensky's advisers, tweeted in English moments after the confidence vote. He wrote,external: ""Leadership is always a heavy burden. Boris Johnson was one of the first who realised the menace of Russia & stood by Volodymyr Zelensky to protect the free world from barbaric invasion. ""The world needs such leaders.

"Boris Johnson remains as Conservative leader after winning a vote of his own MPs The MPs voted by 211 to 148 to keep him as party leader and prime minister At a cabinet meeting on Tuesday, he says he wants to ""draw a line"" under his problems Supporters - and some opponents - of the PM also say it's time to move on Foreign Secretary Liz Truss emphatically backs the PM and dismisses suggestions of a leadership bid ""I think [the PM] won the vote comprehensively,"" says Johnson critic Andrea Leadsom But former leader Lord Hague says the damage done to Johnson is severe Meanwhile, Ukraine's President Zelensky says he is ""very happy"" that Johnson remains PM Edited by Marie Jackson That's it for now but if you still want more, follow our latest news storyhere. Our live coverage today was written by Joseph Lee, Sam Hancock, Alex Kleiderman and Craig Hutchison. It was edited by Owen Amos and Marie Jackson. The bunting came down at No 10 as Boris Johnson promised a renewed focus on the government's agenda We're bringing our live coverage of the fall-out from last night's confidence vote to a close shortly. But here's a round-up of what we learned today: Daniel DaviesBBC Wales political correspondent There was a sense of resignation in the centre of Brecon after Conservative MPs voted to back Boris Johnson. âItâs almost a case of better the devil you know really,â one man told me. We heard the sentiment more than once from people who didnât see an obvious alternative leader in a seat the Tories reclaimed from the Liberal Democrats in 2019. Dawn McIntosh says she is ""on the fence"" about Boris Johnson but is sticking with his party At her carpet and flooring business, Youngs, in the town
centre, Dawn McIntosh said she would stick with the Conservatives. She was âon the fenceâ about Johnson, but thought ânow
would definitely be the wrong timeâ to change the leader. Malcolm MacDonald, whose family have a fish stall in the
town market, said the prime minister had been the subject of a âwitch huntâ. âJohnson has got a lot of faults, but so has everybody,â he
said. âHe looks like a clown, but heâs not as big a clown as
everyone thinks he is.â Malcolm MacDonald: ""Heâs not as big a clown as everyone thinks he is"" Giles Watling is pictured here in 2014 with former prime minister David Cameron Giles Watling, one of the Tory MPs who sided against Boris Johnson on Monday, says the prime minister made some ""slightly foolish"" comments on Partygate before the vote. Speaking to backbenchers in the 1922 Committee, Johnson reportedly defended his appearance at leaving dos that led some Downing Street staff to receive fines for breaking lockdown rules saying he would ""do it again"". Clacton MP Watling says: ""We all made sacrifices during lockdown. ""Sadly I lost one of my sisters and I wasn't able to see her as much as I'd liked because of lockdown. ""Now, I understand the feelings of people out there who went through quite some privation."" Reality Check In
December 2018, Jacob Rees-Mogg spoke to the BBC about the result of the
confidence vote in Theresa May. The
then prime minister won the vote with 63% of Conservative MPs
backing her, somewhat better than the 59% who supported Boris Johnson last
night. At the time,external, Rees-Mogg described the 2018 verdict as âa terrible result for the
prime minister... The prime minister must realise that under all constitutional
norms she ought to go and see the Queen urgently and resign.â However,he described,externalJohnsonâs win â with a smaller majority than May â as âa
good victory for the prime minister â he won comfortably â and now he is
getting on with businessâ. On 6 June on Sky News, Rees-Mogg said of his earlier comments on May: âEveryone said to me
afterwards that was absolute nonsense and I had to eat a good deal of my own
words.â Jenny KumahReporting from Tiverton Chris Williams wants a ""better leader"" Tiverton is an ordinary market town in a
traditional rural part of Devon, but around a month a go it was at the centre
of an extraordinary political story. The Conservative MPNeil Parish resigned after admitting watching pornographyin the House of Commons. And on 23 June, people living here
will get to vote for their next MP. So, how are people here feeling about last
night's confidence vote in the PM? Itâs market day here in Tiverton and shopper
Chris Williams says sheâs voted Conservative in the past. âI donât think Boris has much longer to be
our Prime Minister. Itâs regretful but letâs hope somebody else in the
Conservative Party will come forward and perhaps be a better leader."" Sultan Barak wants the PM to stay Out on the High Street, barber Sultan Barak thinks the Tories should move on from Partygate. âHeâs done more than enough, he works hard and is a good prime minister,â Mr Barak said, adding that the PM should stay. Tiverton and Honiton has been a Conservative seat for decades. Neil Parish won with a majority of 24,000 in the 2019 election. But opposition parties are hoping to change all that in the by-election later this month. Jessica ParkerBrussels correspondent Unionists say the protocol has effectively created a border in the sea between Northern Ireland and Great Britain Boris Johnson may now
hope to be seen to be getting on with the business of government but itâs
emerged that a much talked about piece of legislation has been delayed. Tomorrow was pencilled in for the publication of a bill to allow ministers to
potentially override parts of a treaty governing post-Brexit arrangements for
Northern Ireland. The Northern Ireland Protocol was an agreement that Boris
Johnson signed up to, with the EU - but the UK now argues itâs not working and needs
fundamental changes. While Brussels accepts itâs causing trade disruption, on
goods moving from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, it wants any changes to be
within the terms of the treaty. The impasse saw Foreign Secretary Liz Truss
announce plans to override parts of the protocol but the billâs first reading
has now been pushed back until at least Thursday or even next week. Whitehall sources
say thatâs because the legal text isnât quite ready. Itâs a controversial piece
of legislation that Tory MP and former minister Jesse Norman said
yesterday would be economically damaging and illegal, as he withdrew his support
for the Prime Minister. However the Democratic Unionist Party, who are deeply
unhappy with the protocol, today warned Conservative MPs not to oppose the plans. This video can not be played Volodymyr Zelensky said earlier he was ""very happy"" Boris Johnson survived last night's attempt to oust him from Number 10. Speaking to a Financial Times event, the Ukrainian President said he was glad not to have lost an ""important ally"". The pair have formed a close relationship since Russia launched its invasion, with many voters telling the BBC yesterday and today this was the quality of Johnson's leadership they valued most at the moment. More commentary now on Boris Johnson's leadership, after a former policy adviser to David Cameron accuses the government of having ""no vision"" and heading for an ""autumn of discontent"" after yesterday's vote. Camilla Cavendish tells BBC Radio 4's World at One programme that the PM is fond of ""talking about delivering for the people"", but insists there isn't ""anybody [who] can tell you what he is supposed to be deliveringâ. The result, she adds, is a ""deeply split"" party which will start to see a ""slow drip, drip of a loss of momentum for"" the PM over the coming months. Asked who she thinks could replace Johnson, if it comes to that, she says it can't be anyone from his cabinet because they've been ""tarnished"" defending their boss. She suggests MP Tom Tugendhat or former health secretary Jeremy Hunt, instead. âYou need somebody who [can] recognise and respect convention, which is what we haven't got at the moment."" Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent Despite Boris Johnson's significant majority, he will now have to look over his shoulder when it comes to contentious votes and controversial policies. Will those who want him out be harder to win over? There will be efforts to pressure the prime minister to change the way he governs in the next few weeks. One former cabinet minister told me the PM needed to ""cut the culture war crap"". Within government itself there are those who want change too. One minister told me: ""We have a window to show we get itâ¦Things need to change, most of all him."" Read more from Nick here. Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent In theory, the prime minister is safe from another confidence vote for a year. Under the current rules of the 1922 committee, which organises leadership contests, another challenge can't happen for 12 months after the incumbent wins. But not everyone is convinced. ""All this assumption that he's safe for a year - I don't think anyone believes that,"" one backbencher told me this morning. Rebels are already talking about how they could force another vote on Boris Johnson's future. But there are big political pitfalls ahead too, which could change minds. The subject currently dominating talk among Tory MPs is the two by-elections later this month. Then there's Partygate - which isn't over yet. Parliament's privileges committee is due to look into whether the prime minister misled the House of Commons - and sources close to that process believe that could be damning for Mr Johnson. The committee is thought likely to report in the Autumn. Read more from Nick here. Former Brexit minister Lord Frost has said the size of the opposition to the prime minister shows that a change of policy is needed on the economy. He told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme that ""both sides need to accept the vote"". ""The prime minister's opponents have got to accept the fact that he won, and his supporters and the Prime Minister himself have got to accept that a change of policy is needed,"" he said. ""The vote last night, when nearly 150 of your own MPs vote against you, that is a sign of a big problem and I think the big problem is that we are delivering an economic policy that is not going to deliver prosperity and wealth."" He said the government should reverse tax rises such as the National Insurance increase, introduced to tackle the NHS pandemic backlog and to improve social care. ""It is not Conservative to be raising taxes, and it is undermining growth and prosperity,"" he said. Lord Frost resigned from the government in December last year, citing ""concerns about the direction of travel"", including the need to create a ""a lightly regulated, low-tax, entrepreneurial economy"" and fears that Covid policy was too ""coercive"". Liz Truss has backed Boris Johnson after Monday's confidence vote and dismissed suggestions she is launching a leadership bid - saying she is ""100% focused"" on her role as foreign secretary. Truss says a ""clear majority"" of Tory MPs backed the prime minister and it is ""time to move on"". Work on the Ukraine invasion and the Northern Ireland protocol was ""taking up all of my time"", she says. ""We had a vote yesterday... It is time to draw a line, move forward and focus on what people want us to be talking about - housing, childcare and delivering on lower taxes,"" she adds. The government's chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, who helped steer the country through the pandemic, says it was ""very disappointing"" not everyone stuck to the rules.Asked by ITV News about revelations around events held in Downing Street during the pandemic, he said: ""I think it was really important at all stages that everyone stuck to the rules, there's no question about that. ""It only worked when people stuck to them - and it's very disappointing that that wasn't the case."" Sonia Purnell, Boris Johnson's biographer, tellsBBCScotlandâs Lunchtime Livewhy Partygate has not gone away. âMy mother was in a care home, I thought she was safe.
She went into lockdown before the rest of us and I thought 'well thatâs good, sheâll
be protected'. âBut they sent out people from hospital who had Covid,
they were untested. At least one was put on her floor in the care home. âAnd everyone on her floor died, including my mother. I
was informed by e-mail. âI buried her the day before the Downing Street garden
party, and you know there were only 10 of us allowed.â Ms Purnell says it was a âdeeply traumatic experienceâ
and she says it is very difficult to come to terms with. âThe people who governed us, who we would normally want
to rely on as having our best interests at heart, were drinking
and vomiting, carrying on in a way that was totally undignified at best, almost callous in its disregard for the rest of us."" BBC Radio 5 Live We've been reporting on Boris Johnson's plan to ""draw a line"" under the Partygate saga after yesterday's no-confidence vote, but for some people it isn't that simple. Barbara Garwood, from Derby, spoke to BBC Radio 5 Live earlier about her experience of lockdown. ""For over six months, I didnât see a single person, not anybody. I was stuck in my bungalow on my own and it felt like I was in solitary confinement,"" she said. ""It felt like I'd done something wrong [but] I accepted it and I did it because it was the best thing to do to keep myself safe, but also to keep other people safe. And I did it because it was the law. ""So, to find out that people were drinking and partying... itâs just really insulting."" Boris Johnson survived a vote to oust him last night - but faces some potentially tough tests in the weeks ahead. First come two by-elections this month - contests to replace Conservative MPs who resigned. And another test is expected to take place on 6 July when Johnson is scheduled to appear before MPs on the Liaison Committee. The panel that will question Johnson has not been announced but is made up of the chairs of the Commons select committees - and some of them are prominent critics of the prime minister. Defence Committee chairman Tobias Ellwood and Health Committee chairman Jeremy Hunt have both  called on Johnson to step down. Meanwhile, Environmental Audit Committee chairman Philip Dunne is known to have voted against Mr Johnson and Foreign Affairs Committee chairman Tom Tugendhat is seen as a possible future leadership contender. The Newscast team got together last night to give their reaction to a day of drama as Boris Johnson battled his way through the confidence vote. There's analysis from BBC political editor Chris Mason and colleagues, reaction from key players and Theresa May in a sparkly ballgown.You can listen here. Sir Roger Gale has been an outspoken critic of Boris Johnson and, following the confidence vote, he's restating his view that the prime minister should not take the Conservatives into the next general election. But speaking to the BBC News Channel, Gale stressed ""we are not opponents of the government. We are Conservatives. We are working on a Conservative manifesto. And we are trying to deliver Conservative policies and Conservative legislation. ""It is Mr Johnson who is the problem. He doesn't seem to recognise that."" Asked whether MPs who voted against Johnson could realistically stand at the next general election with him as party leader, Gale suggests ""it is highly doubtful"" he would remain in the position beyond the autumn. He says ""none of the fundamental concerns about the prime minister"" have changed as a result of the confidence vote. As the government tries to stake out its agenda to move on from the confidence vote, Downing Street said the health secretary had updated the cabinet on the post-pandemic challenges facing the NHS. According to Downing Street's account, Sajid Javid told the meeting earlier today we had a ""Blockbuster healthcare system in the age of Netflix"" - a reference to the video rental chain that went bankrupt in 2010 as streaming services took over. Javid said the government had set the NHS a target of ""dramatically improving"" productivity and major changes were needed in areas such as the use of technology and data. It was no longer simply an option to stick to the status quo, the health secretary told colleagues. Â© 2025 BBC.

"This video can not be played Watch: Time to draw a line and take country forward - PM to Cabinet Boris Johnson has promised to cut taxes and government waste after surviving an attempt by his own MPs to oust him. The prime minister thanked ministers for their support in a confidence vote, which saw 41% of Tory MPs saying they had lost faith in him. He urged them to ""draw a line"" under questions about his leadership and vowed a return to ""fundamental"" Tory economic policies. The number of rebels in Monday night's vote was higher than predicted. And some Conservative MPs are still publicly calling on him to quit over widespread Covid rule-breaking in Downing Street. Tobias Ellwood, a longstanding critic of the PM, said the ""honourable way forward"" would be for him to ""step back"" and accept that the task of uniting the Conservative Party to win the next general election is ""too big"". But he added: ""We have to deal with the reality that those days of an honourable resignation are not there."" Ukraine's president: I'm happy Johnson is still PM Tory MP says he backed PM after funding assurances Could Boris Johnson be challenged again? Senior government figures have come out to defend Mr Johnson, including Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab who said there was ""no credible alternative"" to the prime minister. And backbencher Philip Davies - who voted against Mr Johnson on Monday - said: ""The prime minister won fair and square. My view is that you've got to accept the result. If you lose a vote, you accept it. That's the whole point of democracy."" The PM has also received support from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, whotold a Financial Times event,externalhe was ""very happy"" the UK leader had remained in post. The prime minister may want to draw a line under questions over his leadership - but many of his MPs are not willing to do so. Senior MPs have told the BBC that there would be significant pressure on the 1922 committee to change the current rules - which protect the prime minister from another confidence vote for 12 months. Rebels believe if the Conservatives lose the two by-elections being held later this month, in Wakefield, West Yorkshire, and Tiverton Honiton, in Devon - that will prompt a new leadership crisis. They also believe the scandal over lockdown parties in Downing Street is far from over, with the Commons privileges committee still to look into whether the PM misled Parliament when he denied parties had been held in downing street and insisted all rules had been followed. That could unearth new evidence - and the conclusions could be highly damaging. Last night's confidence vote result does not resolve the debate on Boris Johnson's future. As one senior backbencher put it, it means the prime minster thinks he can stay on - but the rebels think they are within touching distance of bringing him down. Read Nick's full analysis In the confidence vote, triggered by Partygate, Mr Johnson was backed by 211 Conservative MPs, but 148 voted to remove him. Mr Johnson hailed this as a ""decisive"" victory - and on Tuesday morning told a cabinet meeting his ""fundamental Conservative instinct"" was to allow people to decide how to spend their money. He urged cabinet ministers to find ways to make savings and told them ""delivering tax cuts"" would help deliver ""considerable growth in employment and economic progress"". But Labour's shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said Mr Johnson did not have ""any sense of honour"" and should resign. Speaking to BBC News, she said Tory MPs who voted to keep the PM in office were ""just not listening to the scale of frustration and anger across the country"". ""There's really got to be some consequences when someone just isn't telling the truth, isn't fit for office, isn't taking the action the country needs"". Mr Johnson won the confidence of 59% of his MPs, however, his critics have noted that his predecessor Theresa May secured the support of 63% when she faced her own confidence vote but was still forced out of office six months later. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey described Mr Johnson as a ""lying lawbreaker"" who was ""clinging on by the skin of his teeth"" while SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford likened him to a ""dead man walking"". ""Whether it's by Tory MPs finally acting in a responsible manner or indeed the Privileges Committee taking action against him, he will be gone,"" Mr Blackford said.

"Pitt and Jolie got married at the vineyard six years after they bought it Angelina Jolie ""sought to inflict harm"" on her former husband Brad Pitt when she sold her stake in their co-owned vineyard to a Russian oligarch, new legal documents have claimed. Pitt is suing his ex-wife for selling her stake in the French vineyard they bought together in 2008. He said her decision to sell her share to a Russian oligarch forced him into partnership with ""a stranger with poisonous associations and intentions"". Jolie has not yet publicly commented. The couple purchased a controlling interest in Chateau Miraval SA, a French company comprising a home and vineyard in the south of France, in 2008. The A-list pair got married there six years later. Pitt says he and his former wife agreed not to sell their stakes in the venue without the permission of the other. In legal documents obtained by the PA news agency, it's alleged that Jolie sold her share to to a Luxembourg-based spirits manufacturer controlled by Russian oligarch Yuri Shefler, without Pitt's knowledge. The lawsuit claims the sale helped launch a ""hostile"" takeover of the wine business that the actor had ""carefully built"". Pitt's lawyers said that under his stewardship, the business had grown into a ""multimillion-dollar international success story"" though Jolie had ""contributed nothing"". ""Through the purported sale, Jolie sought to inflict harm on Pitt,"" according to the documents, which were filed last week. ""Jolie knew and intended that Shefler and his affiliates would try to control the business Pitt had built and to undermine Pitt's investment in Miraval."" Jolie and Pitt got divorced in 2016 It added that Shefler ""has gained notoriety through cut-throat business tactics and dubious professional associations"" and the association with him ""jeopardises the reputation of the brand Pitt so carefully built"". ""All of this is the direct result of Jolie's unlawful and tortious conduct. ""In violation of the parties' agreement, Jolie has sought to force Pitt into partnership with a stranger, and worse yet, a stranger with poisonous associations and intentions."" The Miraval estate is located in the village of Correns in south-eastern France, and was bought by the couple for around 25 million euros (Â£21.3m). Pitt is said to have contributed 60% to the purchase price, with Jolie paying the remaining 40%. Lawyers also said the wine business at the property continues to flourish and ""though she benefited from Miraval's success, Jolie had no involvement in these efforts"". The actress filed for divorce in 2016. Jolie reportedly informed Pitt of her decision to sell to Shefler in January 2021, saying she had reached a ""painful decision, with a heavy heart"". Lawyers for Pitt have requested a trial by jury. Representatives for Jolie declined to comment when contacted by the BBC.

"An investigation by BBC NI Spotlight looked at how Northern Ireland Limited Partnerships (NILPs) are used for Russian money laundering A Northern Ireland corporate loophole that is exploited by international money launderers should be closed, MPs have said. An investigation by BBC NI's Spotlight programme has looked at the use of Northern Ireland Limited Partnerships (NILPs) for money laundering. The secretive companies can be set up in seconds from anywhere in the world. Hundreds have been created since Scotland made regulatory changes disclosing the ownership of similar entities there five years ago. NILPs do have legitimate purposes, but are open to abuse as vehicles for disguising the proceeds of crime. SDLP MP Claire Hanna Earlier this year, the government promised to increase transparency around limited partnerships. South Belfast MP Claire Hanna told Spotlight she wants to see action in Westminster to tighten the rules. ""It should just be closed down,"" Ms Hanna said. ""There aren't any economic benefits for us. ""There's no tax occurring, no jobs being created. There are only downsides and we don't want to get the reputation as a region that is used for that sort of activity because it undermines other legitimate businesses."" Veteran Labour MP Dame Margaret Hodge, who helped reform the rules for Scotland, is surprised that a loophole was left in Northern Ireland and wants to ensure it is closed. Dame Margaret Hodge helped to reform similar rules in Scotland ""I hope that my colleagues in Northern Ireland, from wherever they come in the political spectrum, will join with me in that drive to root out dirty money from the UK. ""It doesn't do us any good. Doesn't do Northern Ireland any good. And it won't help in the long term to create prosperity and economic growth,"" she said. Peter Geoghegan, editor-in-chief of Open Democracy, has investigated the growing problem of NILPs and told Spotlight he discovered a system that was a gift for criminals. ""It's quite remarkable. To set up a Northern Ireland Limited Partnership you don't even have to find out where Northern Ireland is on a map. ""You could be thousands of miles away. You can do it online. You pay quite a small amount of money, fairly quickly, you've got yourself an NILP, and you can pretty much do whatever you want with it. ""And you can own things. You can trade, but most importantly for the people who've got them, they're great for money laundering."" He added there was ""no transparency, no taxes, no accounts, and anonymous owners"". One NILP, Jasterport, was named with others in a report into a huge theft of government funds in Moldova. Investigators hired by the Moldovan parliament examined how these entities helped steal about $1bn (Â£798m) in government funds. The limited partnerships can then be used, with a Northern Ireland registered address and the respectable stamp of a UK legal framework, to open bank accounts elsewhere in the world into which proceeds of crime can flow. But when the money emerges from these accounts, it has a veneer of respectability and is on its way to be laundered into other bank accounts or assets like property. The ownership of the NILPs often remains obscure and rooted through secret companies in offshore territories such as the British Virgin Islands. What the NILPs are doing and who owns them only becomes apparent through data leaks, whistle-blowers or criminal investigations. A search of the companies registry reveals hundreds of these limited partnerships created in Northern Ireland in recent years, a boom in activity that has been spurred by the tightening of rules elsewhere in the UK. In Scotland, for example, more rigorous checks on ownership of limited partnerships were introduced in 2017. But in Northern Ireland, ownership can remain obscure and unverified. The number of NILPs registered annually jumped almost five-fold during the Scottish crackdown, but the number of NILPs has fallen again in recent years. In one street in south Belfast there are more than 100 NILPs registered at one address. One registered there, Norinvest Universal, has been named in legal proceedings in Ukraine in connection with a multi-million grain fraud. In a statement, the Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy described money laundering as a ""despicable crime"". It added that the forthcoming Economic Crime Bill ""will reform the law on limited partnerships across the UK, including those in Northern Ireland, as well as strengthening the powers of Companies House to give it a bigger role in tackling economic crime"". The Spotlight investigation follows a money trail that began with the murder of lawyer Sergei Magnitsky in Russia, saw payments moved into Ireland, and winds up on Montenegro's Adriatic Coast.

"Heavy fighting continues in the eastern Ukrainian city of Severodonetsk, which Russian forces have been trying for weeks to capture It comes as the battle for Donbas grinds on with neither side making major gains A military analyst says the fighting in Ukraine has settled into a rhythm reminiscent of trench warfare in World War One Justin Crump says Russia appears to have slight momentum but are âlucky to capture a field in 24 hoursâ ""Stalemate is not an option"" for Ukraine, the country's president has said, as he again floated the idea of Nato membership Volodymyr Zelensky said the country had lost too many people to ""simply cede our territory"" Meanwhile, the bodies of some Ukrainian fighters killed at the Azovstal steelworks have been handed over to Kyiv, families of Ukraine's Azov unit say Edited by Chris Giles Todayâs live page was edited by Jeremy Gahagan, Alex Therrien, Marie Jackson and Chris Giles. The writers were James Fitzgerald, Sam Hancock, Alexandra FouchÃ©, Emily McGarvey and Hamzah Abbas. Join us tomorrow.   We're pausing our live coverage soon, but here's a look at the main developments in Ukraine today: There is no justification for Russia's brutal disregard of international law in Ukraine, the former German-Chancellor Angela Merkel has said in her first interview since leaving office last year. Merkel said that ""if we start going through the centuries and say which piece of territory belongs to whom, then we'll only have war - that's not possible at all"". Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky previously criticised Merkel and former French President Nicolas Sarkozy for their move to block Ukraine's admission to Nato in 2008, suggesting that it had been a clear ""miscalculation"" that emboldened Russia. Asked about rejecting Ukraine's Nato membership back then, Merkel said that if she hadn't have vetoed the move, ""Putin would do something that would not be good for Ukraine"". The World Bank has downgraded its estimate for global economic growth to 2.9% because of the conflict in Ukraine, which along with other factors, has caused a severe downturn. ""Global growth is expected to slump from 5.7% in 2021 to 2.9% in 2022 - significantly lower than 4.1% that was anticipated in January,""it said in its Global Economic Prospects report,external. ""The world economy is expected to experience its sharpest deceleration following an initial recovery from global recession in more than 80 years,"" it added. Global economic growth had recovered to 5.7% last year following the downturn caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. ""The war in Ukraine, lockdowns in China, supply-chain disruptions, and the risk of stagflation are hammering growth. For many countries, recession will be hard to avoid,"" said the bank's president, David Malpass.  The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, after attacks in March The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency - the UN's nuclear watchdog - has dismissed as absurd allegations by Ukraine's nuclear operator that he had lied about being invited to visit a Russian-occupied nuclear power plant there. Rafael Grossi has been trying to visit the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant - Europe's largest - which Russian forces took control of in early March. But Ukraine's nuclear operator has said a visit by the watchdog would legitimise Russia's occupation of the plant. Speaking to the BBC's Newshour, Grossi said there was a contractual obligation to allow safety inspections by his organisation. ""The government have requested us to do this. There have been statements, I believe even today, implying that... I am lying when I say this."" He added that it was not ""an invitation that can or can't be extended"", but ""an obligation"" as there is a lot of nuclear material at the plant which has not been inspected, leading to an ""abnormal"" and ""unsustainable"" situation. There is no suggestion that the Ukrainian government has accused Grossi of lying, though the country's nuclear operator, Energoatom, says that Ukraine has not invited him to visit. As we've been reporting, heavy fighting is continuing in the eastern Ukrainian city of Severodonetsk, which Russian forces have been trying to capture for weeks. Now, officials say Ukrainian forces are finding it hard to
stave off Russian attacks in the centre of Severodonetsk but
Russia has still not taken control of the city, according to Luhansk regional governor Serhiy Haidai. Earlier, the city's mayor, Oleksandr Stryuk warned thatRussia was aiming to capture the city with more troops, and said that Severdonetsk's armed forces have ""strengthened their positions and are holding the line"". Russian troops
were constantly shelling its twin city Lysychansk, and Moscow's forces were deliberately targeting areas where civilians were hiding, Haidai said on the Telegram messaging app. He reiterated a call for long-range artillery to be sent to Ukraine to enable its troops to repel the Russians in the region. Anna Melnichuk, the deputy leader of Konstantinovka city council, has been outlining the problems faced in her city and neighbouring areas. She told the BBC that while the city, north of Donetsk, is being protected by the Ukrainian army, conditions are difficult. ""We have some problems with gas, and water as well."" She added that the government and local council were in touch with organisations which were providing food, but deliveries by car were difficult due to problems with petrol. When asked about the conditions in Severodonetsk, where fighting continues, Melnichuk said: ""Yes, the situation is truly difficult, but not just because of war actions, but because of problems with water, with food, with electricity."" About 300 Ukrainian civilians, mostly journalists and public activists, are being kept in improvised prisons in Kherson, and 300 more in other occupied settlements in the Kherson region, according to the Ukrainian president's envoy for Crimea, Tamila Tasheva. Tasheva said there are about 600 people in the region who are ""actually hostages and are being held in specially equipped basements, actually jails,"" Interfax news agency reported. ""They are kept in inhumane conditions and tortured. Witnesses report cries that could be heard from the places were our citizens are subjected to such illegal actions,"" she told a news briefing. She said some civilians are being moved from the Kherson region to Crimea and being kept as ""civilian hostages and prisoners of war"". ""Some people who left Mariupol were detained during filtration on the administrative border with Crimea and were taken to the Simferopol remand centre,"" she said. If you are just joining us, or looking for a recap, here's a round-up of the latest events in Ukraine:  British troops in World War One going up the line to their trenches The conflict in parts of Ukraine has been described asreminiscent of the trench warfare used in World War I- but what is meant by the term? Trenches are ditches dug into the ground that offer shelter and protection against enemy fire and means both sides sacrifice mobility in order to gain protection. During World War I, trenches were developed from simple ditches into more complex systems, with a front line, known as the fire trench, the second line, known as the support trench, and a third line, known as the reserve trench. These trenches were connected by communication trenches, which allowed men to run between lines, without ever having to go over open ground. The BBC has previously been granted access to trenches being used by the Ukrainian army. The soldiers working and living in them told the BBC that they are sleeping and eating in them, while building new ones every day. This video can not be played Ukraine war: Inside Kyiv's trench defences Joe InwoodReporting from Kyiv There had been much speculation about what had happened to Aiden Aslin and Shaun Pinner,two British men captured fighting in the Ukrainian port city of Mariupol. Footage of Aslin shortly after his capture - his face bloodied and bruised, being interviewed by a Russian propaganda channel - led many to fear for his wellbeing. Now we know both men are alive and are being held in the occupied Donestsk Peopleâs Republic, after a video appeared of them standing in what appears to be a court. Standing alongside a third man, Moroccan national Saaudun Brahim, the pair spoke only to confirm they knew the charges against them and were happy for their case to proceed without the evidence of witnesses. Both were able to stand unaided and seemed aware of their surroundings. According to the Interfax news agency, the leader of the self-proclaimed DNR, Denis Pushilin, has said they will be charged in the âSupreme Courtâ of the region, which is not recognised internationally. The British pair are facing several âchargesâ, including violent seizure of power, acting as mercenaries and undergoing training to carry out terrorist activities. It is feared the court, which is not internationally recognised, could give them the death penalty if it finds them guilty. Russia's parliament has passed two bills ending theEuropean Court of Human Rightsâ jurisdictionin Russia, after it announced it would exit the court in March amid the conflict in Ukraine. The ECHR aims to apply and protect the civil and political rights of the continent's citizens, and this previously provided a way to pursue legal and human rights cases against Russia that had either been rejected or ignored by Russian courts. One of the bills removes Russia from the court's jurisdiction and the second bill sets 15 March as the cut-off point, meaning rulings against Russia made after that date are not to be implemented, the RIA Novosti news agency reports. The Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe expelled Russia from the organisation on 15 March, which the ECHR is part of, in response to Russiaâs invasion of Ukraine. Russia has said that it independently decided to leave the Council of Europe, with former President Dmitry Medvedev saying that Russiaâs exit from the organisation represented an opportunity to restore the death penalty, which the Council of Europeanâs rules prohibit. A Russian journalist who was fined and released after she protested against the war in Ukraine on a live TV news programme earlier this year says she feels Ukrainian and will change her surname as a sign of support. Marina Ovsyannikova - who says her father is Ukrainian - announced the movein a post on Facebook,external. ""I'm not a 'good Russian', I'm Ukrainian. As a sign of support of Ukraine, I intend to change the surname of Ovsyannikov to the native Tkachuk."" Formerly an editor at Russian state-controlled Channel One,she was shortly detained in Marchin Russia after she ran on to the set of the channel holding a sign saying ""no war"". She has since emigrated to Germany. James WaterhouseReporting from Kyiv âVery happyâ were two of the words President Volodymyr Zelensky used in reaction to UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson surviving his vote of confidence, describing him as a âtrue friend of Ukraineâ. Itâs a sentiment echoed by many on the cobbled streets of central Kyiv, mainly because the UK government is one of the biggest supporters of the country in this war, outside the European Union and United States. Of course, peopleâs views of the British prime minister arenât shaped by domestic issues. Even before this invasion, though, Ukrainians cared deeply about the level of military aid being supplied by western allies as Russia continued to gather troops on the border. They are continuing to defend, but Russia has already taken a fifth of Ukrainian territory. As we reported earlier, military analyst Justin Crump has said conflict in parts of Ukraine is nowreminiscent of the trench warfare seen in World War One. Here's a selection of images capturing life for Ukrainian troops in trench positions on the frontline: Soldiers walk in trenches to take cover for Russian artillery strikes at an undisclosed defence position on the outskirts of the separatist region of Donetsk Ukrainian troops walk along a trench at a position on the frontline near Bakhmut in Ukraine's Donbas region Ukraine's army appears to have an advantage in any given battle at the moment because they are generally defending rather than attacking, according to military analyst Justin Crump A Ukrainian servicewoman looks out of a trench at a position near a frontline in the Donetsk region Parts of Ukraine have been taken back to the trench-filled warfare of decades ago Earlier, we reported on the fighting in Severodonetsk and Lysychansk. President Zelensky called them ""dead cities"" and now Severodonetsk's Mayor, Oleksandr Stryuk, has been speaking to Ukrainian TV about the current situation.He warned that Russia is aiming to capture the city with more troops, and said that Severdonetsk's armed forces have ""strengthened their positions and are holding the line"". An update from the Ukrainian armed forces earlier today also suggested that there were further Russian troops in the area. It has not yet been possible for the BBC to verify exact details of the fighting. Danny AeberhardEurope Regional Editor, BBC World Service As we've been reporting, Ukraine's national nuclear operator has accused the head of the UN nuclear watchdog, IAEA, of lying about being invited by Ukraine to visit the Russian-occupied nuclear plant at Zaporizhzhia. The IAEA's director general, Rafael Grossi, insisted on Monday that such a visit would take place, ideally sooner rather than later, citing fears over nuclear security at the plant Ukraine's nuclear operator, Energoatom, did not mince its words. In a statement, it said it saw efforts by Grossi to visit the Zaporizhzhia plant as an attempt to legitimise Russia's occupation of the facility. It said Ukraine had not invited him to visit, and had refused permission previously. Energoatom also blamed Russia for blocking the transfer of crucial data from the plant to the IAEA. Grossi - in an impassioned address on Monday - stressed a visit was vital, saying the Zaporizhzhia plant was disconnected from safety systems. Russian forcestook over the plant- Europe's largest - at the start of the conflict. Russian forces now control almost all of Ukraine's easternmost region, the Russian defence minister says. 97% of Luhansk Oblast has been ""liberated"", Sergei Shoigu told a meeting of the defence ministry, broadcast on state TV. Shoigu claims that residential areas of the flashpoint city of Severodonetsk are in Moscow's hands, and further attempts are being made to gain industrial areas. It was not possible for the BBC to independently verify the claims. There have been conflicting accounts of which army controls which territory as battles for the city continue. James FitzGeraldBBC News Russia could look to make 'micro-scale' gains in Kharkiv, says an expert Fighting
in Ukraine has settled into a rhythm reminiscent of trench warfare in World War One, says a military analyst. Justin
Crump, chief executive of security consultancy Sibylline, tells the BBC the
conflict has become âmicro-levelâ - with Russia now âlucky to capture a field
in 24 hoursâ. This is because the defending army appears to have an advantage
in any given battle at the moment. In some
places, that favours Ukrainians holding onto their territory; in others, it
suits Russian troops occupying cities theyâve captured. Crump, a
former British Army serviceman, says Russia appears to have slight momentum â
as its troops âgrind forwardâ. Moscow will want to capture Severodonetsk and
then the remainder of the eastern Donbas region in order to declare âany sort
of victoryâ. He expects
the Kremlin to set its sights Zaporizhzhia next, then make a fresh attempt at Kharkiv and look to capture Odesa on the south coast. Russiaâs
brand of attritional warfare has been seen to work, Crump says â but ânothing
is inevitableâ about what happens next. âRussiaâs
got to be able to keep paying the bill,â he says â referring to the
expense of the war, as well as the human toll. As a
result of poor tactics and other shortcomings, Russia has also shown that it
can only attack successfully on a single axis at a time, Crump claims. From the
Ukrainian perspective, high-spec weapons donations from Western nations â such as
missile-launchers recently promised by the US and UK â are no âsilver bulletâ,
says Crump, because the conflict has become less precise than that. He says
there is also the question of how long Western countries keep up their support
for Ukraine. But
Russia âcanât leave the frontline where it isâ, he adds â suggesting that
Ukraine will refuse to give up the territories currently in the hands of its
enemy. There is,
therefore, the possibility of a âfrozen conflict at bestâ. The Azovstal steelwork was for weeks under relentless Russian shelling We reported earlierthat the bodies of some Ukrainian fighters killed defending the key southern port of Mariupol from Russian forces at the Azovstal steel plant have been handed over to Kyiv. The fighters' families have said this was part of a prisoner exchange with Russia, with each side receiving 160 bodies. Of those on the Ukrainian side, more than 50 bodies were members of the Azov regiment, the families said on the Telegram messenging service. The identification process is continuing. The families added that talks are ongoing on further prisoner swaps, without giving any further details. More than 2,500 Azovstal defenders - which also include border guards, police and territorial defence - are currently being held by Russia, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said earlier. Kyiv is seeking the handover of them all, but several leading Russian lawmakers are demanding that some of the soldiers - specifically from the Azov regiment - should be put on trial. The regiment was set up in 2014, with some of its members initially linked to far-right groups. Russia describes Azov regiment fighters as neo-Nazis - a claim denied by Ukraine, who says the unit has been reformed and is outside politics. Â© 2025 BBC.

"A USB Type-C charger (right) beside Apple's proprietary Lightning cable The UK government says it is not ""currently considering"" copying European Union plans for a common charging cable. The EU has provisionally agreed all new portable electronic devices must, by autumn 2024, use a USB Type-C charger, a move it says will benefit consumers. Critics say it will stifle innovation. Under the current post-Brexit arrangements, the regulation would apply to Northern Ireland, according to EU and UK officials. According to thea December 2021 parliamentary report,external, the ""new requirements may also apply to devices sold in Northern Ireland under the terms of the Northern Ireland protocol in the Brexit agreement, potentially triggering divergence of product standards with the rest of the UK"". The treaty works by keeping Northern Ireland inside the EU's single market for goods, while the rest of the UK is outside it. A row between the UK and EU about how to reform the Northern Ireland protocol remains unresolved. A UK government spokesperson said ""we are not currently considering replicating this requirement"". Apple products such as iPhones and iPads will have to conform to the new regulation, as will, eventually laptop computers. Existing devices will be exempt. The agreement will be brought before the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers after their summer recesses, where it can be formally approved and then published. Apple told the BBC it had no new comment to make. It argued against the proposal, when it was first introduced, in September 2021,with a representative telling BBC News:""Strict regulation mandating just one type of connector stifles innovation rather than encouraging it, which in turn will harm consumers in Europe and around the world"". Apple is the biggest manufacturer to use a custom charging port that is exclusive to some of its products - its iPhone series uses an Apple-made Lightning connector. The new rule will cover a range of ""small and medium-sized portable electronics"", according the EU, including: mobile phones tablets headphones and headsets handheld videogame consoles portable speakers Any of these charged using a wired cable will have to have a USB Type-C port, regardless of who makes the devices. Laptops will also have to abide by the ruling but manufacturers will have 40 months after it comes into effect to make changes. The agreement also includes a plan to let customers choose whether or not they want a charging cable with their new electronics. ""This law is a part of a broader EU effort to make products in the EU more sustainable, to reduce electronic waste, and make consumers' lives easier,""the EU said in its announcement,external. It would save consumers ""up to â¬250m [Â£213m] a year on unnecessary charger purchases"" and cut 11,000 tonnes of waste per year, the EU added.

"Thousands of railway workers will walk out in a three-day national strike later this month which threatens major summer travel disruption across the UK. The RMT Union said it will ""shut down"" the country's railway network on 21, 23 and 25 June after talks over pay and redundancies fell through. But the Transport Secretary accused RMT of ""jumping the gun"" and said strikes could put off people using trains. The action is being dubbed the ""biggest rail strike in modern history"". More than 40,000 staff from Network Rail and 13 train operators are expected to take part. On the first day of the planned strike on 21 June, London Underground RMT workers plan to walk out in a separate dispute over pensions and job losses, taking the total number of staff - along those from with Network Rail and the train companies - to more than 50,000. The BBC understands the action will leave around a fifth of mainline rail services running on the strike days, with the majority operating for a maximum of 12 hours. The industrial action also coincides with Glastonbury Festival, which runs from 22 to 26 June. When is the rail strike and which lines will be affected? RMT has said Network Rail plans to cut up to 2,500 jobs as part of a Â£2bn reduction in spending, with the proposed job cuts including workers who maintain tracks, signals and overhead lines among other things. It also claimed train operators had been subject to pay freezes and changes to their terms and conditions. ""We have a cost-of-living crisis, and it is unacceptable for railway workers to either lose their jobs or face another year of a pay freeze,"" Mick Lynch, RMT general secretary, said. Mr Lynch said the union was open to ""meaningful negotiations"" with rail bosses and ministers, but warned they would need ""new proposals to prevent months of disruption on our railways."" Andrew Haines, Network Rail's chief executive, said he understood the cost of living had increased, but argued the union ""must recognise we are a public body and any pay increase has to be affordable for taxpayers"". ""Travel habits have changed forever and the railway must change as well,"" he said. ""We cannot expect to take more than our fair share of public funds, and so we must modernise our industry to put it on a sound financial footing for the future. Failure to modernise will only lead to industry decline and more job losses in the long run."" Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said the decision to strike was ""incredibly disappointing"" and accused RMT of ""jumping the gun"" by announcing strike dates ""when talks have only just begun"". ""The pandemic has changed travel habits - with 25% fewer ticket sales and the taxpayer stepping in to keep the railways running at a cost of Â£16bn, equivalent to Â£600 per household. We must act now to put the industry on a sustainable footing,"" he added. ""We once again want to urge the unions to come to talks with the rail industry so we can work together to build a better, more modern, passenger-focussed, railway."" The Rail Delivery Group, which represents train operating firms, also urged the union to call off the strikes. Steve Montgomery, the industry body's chairman, said ""no one wins in the event of a strike"". ""Staff lose pay, the industry loses vital revenue making it harder to afford pay increases, and passengers and businesses are disrupted. ""While we will keep as many services running as possible, sadly if this action goes ahead, significant disruption will be inevitable. We therefore urge passengers to plan their journeys carefully and find alternative ways to travel during the strike period where possible.""â¯ If this strike goes ahead as proposed, only around a fifth of services would run on the strike dates themselves. But nearly the whole week's service would be severely affected in a week when several major sporting and cultural events are scheduled. A senior industry source said one reason is that if some signalling workers don't turn up for overnight shifts, the next day's morning peak will be affected. Now the dates are known, timetable planners will be rushing to put together a six-day timetable covering both strike dates and the days after. Work has been ongoing for a while to come up with contingency plans to try and minimise the impact on the economy. A key part of preparation now will be working with freight businesses to work out which goods can run on the railway with severely reduced capacity. In some cases, some key products could take priority over passenger services. An example of that might be fuel to a power station which has limited on-site storage.

"Pitt and Jolie got married at the vineyard six years after they bought it Angelina Jolie ""sought to inflict harm"" on her former husband Brad Pitt when she sold her stake in their co-owned vineyard to a Russian oligarch, new legal documents have claimed. Pitt is suing his ex-wife for selling her stake in the French vineyard they bought together in 2008. He said her decision to sell her share to a Russian oligarch forced him into partnership with ""a stranger with poisonous associations and intentions"". Jolie has not yet publicly commented. The couple purchased a controlling interest in Chateau Miraval SA, a French company comprising a home and vineyard in the south of France, in 2008. The A-list pair got married there six years later. Pitt says he and his former wife agreed not to sell their stakes in the venue without the permission of the other. In legal documents obtained by the PA news agency, it's alleged that Jolie sold her share to to a Luxembourg-based spirits manufacturer controlled by Russian oligarch Yuri Shefler, without Pitt's knowledge. The lawsuit claims the sale helped launch a ""hostile"" takeover of the wine business that the actor had ""carefully built"". Pitt's lawyers said that under his stewardship, the business had grown into a ""multimillion-dollar international success story"" though Jolie had ""contributed nothing"". ""Through the purported sale, Jolie sought to inflict harm on Pitt,"" according to the documents, which were filed last week. ""Jolie knew and intended that Shefler and his affiliates would try to control the business Pitt had built and to undermine Pitt's investment in Miraval."" Jolie and Pitt got divorced in 2016 It added that Shefler ""has gained notoriety through cut-throat business tactics and dubious professional associations"" and the association with him ""jeopardises the reputation of the brand Pitt so carefully built"". ""All of this is the direct result of Jolie's unlawful and tortious conduct. ""In violation of the parties' agreement, Jolie has sought to force Pitt into partnership with a stranger, and worse yet, a stranger with poisonous associations and intentions."" The Miraval estate is located in the village of Correns in south-eastern France, and was bought by the couple for around 25 million euros (Â£21.3m). Pitt is said to have contributed 60% to the purchase price, with Jolie paying the remaining 40%. Lawyers also said the wine business at the property continues to flourish and ""though she benefited from Miraval's success, Jolie had no involvement in these efforts"". The actress filed for divorce in 2016. Jolie reportedly informed Pitt of her decision to sell to Shefler in January 2021, saying she had reached a ""painful decision, with a heavy heart"". Lawyers for Pitt have requested a trial by jury. Representatives for Jolie declined to comment when contacted by the BBC.

"This video can not be played Volodymyr Zelensky says he is ""very happy"" Boris Johnson remains UK prime minister Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said he was ""very happy"" Boris Johnson was still UK prime minister after he survived an attempt to oust him. Mr Johnson won a confidence vote despite a major revolt that saw 148 of his own Tory MPs vote to remove him. ""I'm glad we haven't lost an important ally, this is great news,"" Mr Zelensky said at an online event. Mr Johnson has forged a close relationship with President Zelensky since Russia's invasion of Ukraine. He called Mr Johnson a ""true friend of Ukraine"" and a ""concrete"" supporter in an interview at a virtual conference hosted by the Financial Times on Tuesday. The UK was among the first to provide weapons to support Ukraine's defence and - like its Western allies - has imposed sweeping sanctions on Russian targets prosecuting the war. In April, Mr Johnson pledged ""unwavering support"" ona visit to the capital Kyiv, where he did an unannounced walkabout of the city with President Zelensky. This video can not be played Watch: Boris Johnson and Volodymyr Zelensky tour Kyiv's near-empty streets Mr Johnson has faced a backlash from MPs and the public after he was fined by police for breaking his own lockdown laws at a 2020 party in Downing Street, where the prime minister lives and works. A report by a senior civil servant criticised failures of leadership in Downing Street, where officials and staff were issued with a total of 123 fines for breaking Covid rules on indoor gatherings during the pandemic. Some Conservative MPs had cited the war in Ukraine as a reason not to oust Mr Johnson from office in the confidence vote in Parliament on Monday. Rallying his MPs ahead of the vote, Mr Johnson said it was the wrong time for ""unforced domestic political drama"" when Ukraine was fighting Russian President Vladimir Putin's forces. Mr Johnson won the backing of 59% of his MPs, describing the result as ""extremely good, positive, conclusive"" and insisting his leadership was now secure. LIVE: Fallout of Johnson's confidence vote win What happens next after confidence vote? Chris Mason: PM's opponents are not defeated However, those who had voted against Mr Johnson said the scale of the rebellion had weakened his authority, with some calling on him to resign. Reacting to Monday night's result, cabinet minister Nadhim Zahawi said he thought President Zelensky would be ""punching the air because he knows his great ally Boris Johnson will be prime minister tomorrow morning"". Those comments were criticised by some MPs, includingLabour's Karl Turner,external, who urged Mr Zahawi to apologise for dragging the Ukrainian president ""into this Tory party civil war"". On Monday, ahead of the confidence vote, Mr Johnson called Mr Zelensky to discuss Ukraine's defence of its eastern Donbas region, where Russian forces are advancing. In a tweet,external, Mr Johnson wrote: ""We're unwavering in our mission of ensuring Ukraine is defended and supported for the long-term."" The UK's military support to Ukraine amounts to Â£750m so far and includes thousands of anti-tank missiles, 20 armoured vehicles, 4.5 tonnes of plastic explosives, and electronic warfare kit. On top of this,the UK says,externalit is providing Â£220m of humanitarian assistance to Ukraine. As a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP), the UK was the sixth largest donor of aid to Ukraine globally between January and May,according to research by the Kiel Institute for the World Economy,external. Last month, the UK government said it would offer further aid and military support to Ukraine worth Â£1.3bn to boost the country's defence against Russia. Mr Johnson spoke to President Zelensky on the phone ahead of the confidence vote on Monday Ukrainian commentators and officials expressed relief that Mr Johnson had won Monday's confidence vote, with some noting that UK had become a key arms supplier for the country. Mykhaylo Podolyak, one of Mr Zelensky's advisers, tweeted in English moments after the confidence vote. He wrote,external: ""Leadership is always a heavy burden. Boris Johnson was one of the first who realised the menace of Russia & stood by Volodymyr Zelensky to protect the free world from barbaric invasion. ""The world needs such leaders.

"Douglas Ross has performed two U-turns over Boris Johnson's premiership Boris Johnson was never Douglas Ross's first choice to be UK Conservative leader but he did back him in the 2019 contest to replace Theresa May. He has not said whether he now regrets that decision but he has certainly changed his mind about him. More than once. In January,Mr Ross withdrew his support for Boris Johnsonsaying his position had become ""untenable"" over lockdown parties and calling for a confidence vote. He then reversed that positionwhen the war in Ukraine started, arguing that political upheaval at home would play into the hands of Vladimir Putin. That no longer seems to be of primary concern, Mr Ross having now completed a double U-turn by voting for the motion of no confidence in Boris Johnson's leadership. In a statement, he said that while the timing of the vote was not ideal, he had listened to public anger over Partygate and could not in ""good faith"" continue to back the PM. That decision brings him into line with the bulk of his Tory colleagues at Holyrood, but his numerous changes in position have raised questions about his own leadership capabilities. PM vote: Scottish Secretary says time to move on PM wins vote but suffers large Tory rebellion As one pro-Johnson MP put it, he would be reluctant to be driven anywhere by Douglas Ross for fear of not knowing where the journey might end! The reality is that, given his flip-flopping form, the Scottish Tory leader would have faced criticism and embarrassment whichever way he'd voted. Either for backing a law-breaking PM that the Scottish party has blamed for heavy losses in the recent local elections or - as it turns out - for abandoning him despite having insisted he should continue to lead the UK through the Ukraine crisis. Mr Ross was one of the 148 Tory MPs who expressed no confidence and among four of the six Tories with Westminster seats in Scotland to take that position. The Scottish rebels are fairly unusual in that they have all publicly declared how they voted in what was a secret ballot. Alister Jack continues to stand behind Boris Johnson The MP John Lamont quit as an aide to the foreign secretary, Liz Truss, after he cast his vote against the PM. It's not clear if former Scottish Secretary David Mundell (who was dumped from Cabinet by Mr Johnson) will be able to continue as a trade envoy to New Zealand after his rebellion. MP Andrew Bowie - the fourth Scottish Tory MP refusing to back the PM - stepped down from his role as a vice-chair of the UK Conservative party some time ago. This rift between MPs and their leader is not sustainable. It's hard to imagine, for example, a UK general election campaign with key Scottish Tories unable to endorse their own candidate for Number 10. On the other side of the argument - still standing by their leader - MPs David Duguid and Alister Jack, who sits in Cabinet as Scottish secretary. In a statement, Mr Jack said the PM's 211 votes represented a ""clear majority"" and that it was time to move on from Partygate and ""get on with what really matters"". That may be wishful thinking on his part because having won the vote, Boris Johnson has also publicly lost the confidence of two fifths of his own MPs. That's a worse result than his predecessor Theresa May got and she was forced to resign six months later. It's not certain Boris Johnson will suffer the same fate, but nor is it certain that he will be able to govern effectively in the months ahead. The trouble with rebellion is it can be habit-forming and if only a few dozen Tory MPs switch sides in certain Commons votes, the government loses. Even the threat of that could divert ministers from their course. There is the potential for further trouble in Conservative ranks if the party suffers defeat in the forthcoming by-elections in Wakefield and in Tiverton and Honiton - which certainly look difficult for the Tories. A privileges committee inquiry examining whether or not Boris Johnson knowingly misled parliament over Partygate is another potential flashpoint. That does not mean the PM - protected as he is from another confidence vote for a year - is without agency. He has the power to reset policy in an effort to renew his appeal to Tory MPs and the wider public. He is expected to bring forward new measures to cut childcare costs and help more people onto the housing ladder in the coming days. Some have speculated that raising the prospect of an early general election might help him concentrate minds. It is to his advantage that his critics currently lack an obvious candidate to replace him as Tory leader and PM. Having won the confidence vote, Boris Johnson's premiership continues but with reduced authority which, as previous prime ministers have found, is not easy to regain.

"Rangers Football Club have been accused of conspiring to illegally fix the prices of club merchandise. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) provisionally found the club colluded with retailers JD Sports and Elite Sports to keep prices of replica kits high. The CMA said the three parties could expect heavy fines if found guilty. Rangers said they would review the provisional findings before submitting a response. The UK competition watchdog said it was concerned that Elite and JD Sports may have broken competition law from September 2018 to at least July 2019 over prices of Rangers merchandise. Its provisional findings said Rangers were also involved in the alleged collusion, but only to the extent of fixing the price of adult replica short-sleeved home shirts from September 2018 to at least mid-November 2018. Rangers face investigation over replica kit prices Michael Grenfell, executive director of enforcement at the CMA, said: ""Football fans are well-known for their loyalty towards their teams. ""We are concerned that, in this case, Elite, JD Sports and, to some extent, Rangers, may have colluded to keep prices high, so that the two retailers could pocket more money for themselves at the expense of fans."" The Scottish Premiership club said: ""The statement of objections represents the CMA's provisional view only. It is not a finding that Rangers has broken the law and does not mean that the CMA will issue a final decision or impose a fine on Rangers. ""Rangers is committed to operating its business in full compliance with all laws, including competition law, and treats this matter very seriously."" Rangers are accused of fixing the price of adult replica short-sleeved home shirts The parties involved now have the chance to make representation on the provisional findings before a final judgement is made. The CMA said that at the time, Elite was the manufacturer of Rangers-branded clothing and also sold the products directly through its Gers Online Store, and later in shops across Glasgow and Belfast. JD Sports was the only UK-wide retailer selling those Rangers club clothing items at the time. The CMA claims that Rangers FC became concerned that at the start of the 2018-19 football season, JD Sports was selling the Rangers replica top at a lower price than Elite, which was seen at the time as the club's so-called retail partner. The watchdog's provisional findings said they then conspired for JD to increase the price of the Rangers adult short-sleeved home replica shirt by nearly 10%, from Â£55 to Â£60, to bring it in line with Gers Online prices. The CMA also believes that Elite and JD, this time without involvement from Rangers, may have worked together to fix the prices of Rangers-branded clothing - including training wear and replica kit - over a longer period. It said this included the two firms aligning the amount and timing of discounts towards the end of the football season in 2019, to protect their profit margins at the expense of fans. The CMA said Elite and JD had confessed to cartel activity and had since co-operated with the watchdog. They could receive reduced fines if they continue to co-operate, according to the CMA. Businesses found guilty of breaking competition law can be fined up to 10% of annual turnover. JD Sports Fashion said it planned to book a hit of about Â£2m to cover any fine from the CMA and legal costs in its annual results for the year to 29 January, which it will release ""shortly"". Lisa Webb, Which? consumer law expert, said: ""It's completely unacceptable that sports retailers and a football club have been working together to exploit the loyalty of football fans by fixing the prices of kits. ""If this provisional finding is confirmed, the Competition and Markets Authority must not hesitate to heavily fine the guilty parties - and send a firm message that this behaviour is unacceptable and won't be tolerated.""

"Pitt and Jolie got married at the vineyard six years after they bought it Angelina Jolie ""sought to inflict harm"" on her former husband Brad Pitt when she sold her stake in their co-owned vineyard to a Russian oligarch, new legal documents have claimed. Pitt is suing his ex-wife for selling her stake in the French vineyard they bought together in 2008. He said her decision to sell her share to a Russian oligarch forced him into partnership with ""a stranger with poisonous associations and intentions"". Jolie has not yet publicly commented. The couple purchased a controlling interest in Chateau Miraval SA, a French company comprising a home and vineyard in the south of France, in 2008. The A-list pair got married there six years later. Pitt says he and his former wife agreed not to sell their stakes in the venue without the permission of the other. In legal documents obtained by the PA news agency, it's alleged that Jolie sold her share to to a Luxembourg-based spirits manufacturer controlled by Russian oligarch Yuri Shefler, without Pitt's knowledge. The lawsuit claims the sale helped launch a ""hostile"" takeover of the wine business that the actor had ""carefully built"". Pitt's lawyers said that under his stewardship, the business had grown into a ""multimillion-dollar international success story"" though Jolie had ""contributed nothing"". ""Through the purported sale, Jolie sought to inflict harm on Pitt,"" according to the documents, which were filed last week. ""Jolie knew and intended that Shefler and his affiliates would try to control the business Pitt had built and to undermine Pitt's investment in Miraval."" Jolie and Pitt got divorced in 2016 It added that Shefler ""has gained notoriety through cut-throat business tactics and dubious professional associations"" and the association with him ""jeopardises the reputation of the brand Pitt so carefully built"". ""All of this is the direct result of Jolie's unlawful and tortious conduct. ""In violation of the parties' agreement, Jolie has sought to force Pitt into partnership with a stranger, and worse yet, a stranger with poisonous associations and intentions."" The Miraval estate is located in the village of Correns in south-eastern France, and was bought by the couple for around 25 million euros (Â£21.3m). Pitt is said to have contributed 60% to the purchase price, with Jolie paying the remaining 40%. Lawyers also said the wine business at the property continues to flourish and ""though she benefited from Miraval's success, Jolie had no involvement in these efforts"". The actress filed for divorce in 2016. Jolie reportedly informed Pitt of her decision to sell to Shefler in January 2021, saying she had reached a ""painful decision, with a heavy heart"". Lawyers for Pitt have requested a trial by jury. Representatives for Jolie declined to comment when contacted by the BBC.

"Conservative confidence in Boris Johnson has been ""diminished"", with the prime minister now living on ""borrowed time"" without ""any political authority"", NI politicians have said. Conservative MPsvoted in favour of Mr Johnsonremaining as prime minister by 211 to 148. The confidence vote came ahead of the expectedintroduction of controversial legislationlater this week on the Northern Ireland Protocol. Mr Johnson said the win was ""decisive"". Gavin Robinson, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) MP for East Belfast, said the confidence vote was ""not as strong"" as Mr Johnson would have wanted. ""He has the confidence of his party, but it's greatly diminished,"" he said. Mr Robinson said the political turmoil surrounding the prime minister ""shouldn't endanger"" the protocol legislation set to be published by the government. Unionist politicianshave protested against the protocol, which has guaranteed free trade across the Irish land border, but has in turn added some restrictions to the movement of goods between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. ""The fundamentals at the heart of the legislation are about resolving the issues of the Northern Ireland protocol that are plaguing politics in Northern Ireland,"" Mr Robinson said. It was a victory which came at a cost for Boris Johnson and one which he may pay for at a later date. He won the vote but lost the support of more than 40% of his MPs. The result will energise his opponents who could now make life difficult for the prime minister when it comes to votes in the Commons. The first test could come this week with the introduction of controversial legislation to override parts of the Northern Ireland Protocol. Boris Johnson is determined to press on safe in the knowledge he wont face another confidence vote for at least a year, but it could be a long 12 months. Alliance MP Stephen Farry said the prime minister had been ""badly wounded"" by the scale of the vote against him. He said he did not believe that Mr Johnson could remain in power and was on ""borrowed time"". On the Northern Ireland Protocol legislation, Mr Farry said: ""If we have a wounded Boris Johnson the danger is he may be lashing out and doing things that are very irresponsible to shore up his own base."" Reacting to the vote, the SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said it was ""absolutely clear now that Boris Johnson, having lost all moral authority, has now lost any political authority that he had"". Despite the level of unrest in the Conservative Party, the Foyle MP said it was unlikely the prime minister would resign ""voluntarily"". How could Boris Johnson be voted out by Tory MPs? Who are the Tory MPs calling on Johnson to go? He described the protocol legislations as a political ""tactic"" and not about ""people in Northern Ireland"". Earlier on Monday, Sinn FÃ©in vice-president Michelle O'Neill said politics could not be a ""hostage to Tory in-fighting"". ""Boris Johnson's threat to (the) protocol is to risk their entire agreement with EU on withdrawal and with colossal impact,"" she said. Mr Johnson has said a ""legislative solution"" was needed to address the protocol - a move which Sinn FÃ©in had previously labelled as unacceptable and obstructionist. Criticism from some backbench members has intensified in recent weeks following the Sue Gray report into parties at Downing Street during the Covid-19 pandemic. Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis reaffirmed his support for the prime minister following the vote. Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis reaffirmed his support for the prime minister following the vote. On Twitter he said: ""The PM has won the support of Conservative MPs this evening, at a higher level than even when he won the leadership. ""Now we must focus on getting on with a clear focus on people's priorities."" The PM won 59% of the vote, meaning he is now immune from a Conservative leadership challenge for a year. Mr Johnsondescribed his confidence vote win as ""decisive"". He said it was ""an opportunity to put behind us all the stuff that the media goes on about"". The vote share in support of Mr Johnson was lower than the 63% received by former Prime Minister Theresa May when she won a party confidence vote in 2018.

"This video can not be played Watch: Time to draw a line and take country forward - PM to Cabinet Boris Johnson has promised to cut taxes and government waste after surviving an attempt by his own MPs to oust him. The prime minister thanked ministers for their support in a confidence vote, which saw 41% of Tory MPs saying they had lost faith in him. He urged them to ""draw a line"" under questions about his leadership and vowed a return to ""fundamental"" Tory economic policies. The number of rebels in Monday night's vote was higher than predicted. And some Conservative MPs are still publicly calling on him to quit over widespread Covid rule-breaking in Downing Street. Tobias Ellwood, a longstanding critic of the PM, said the ""honourable way forward"" would be for him to ""step back"" and accept that the task of uniting the Conservative Party to win the next general election is ""too big"". But he added: ""We have to deal with the reality that those days of an honourable resignation are not there."" Ukraine's president: I'm happy Johnson is still PM Tory MP says he backed PM after funding assurances Could Boris Johnson be challenged again? Senior government figures have come out to defend Mr Johnson, including Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab who said there was ""no credible alternative"" to the prime minister. And backbencher Philip Davies - who voted against Mr Johnson on Monday - said: ""The prime minister won fair and square. My view is that you've got to accept the result. If you lose a vote, you accept it. That's the whole point of democracy."" The PM has also received support from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, whotold a Financial Times event,externalhe was ""very happy"" the UK leader had remained in post. The prime minister may want to draw a line under questions over his leadership - but many of his MPs are not willing to do so. Senior MPs have told the BBC that there would be significant pressure on the 1922 committee to change the current rules - which protect the prime minister from another confidence vote for 12 months. Rebels believe if the Conservatives lose the two by-elections being held later this month, in Wakefield, West Yorkshire, and Tiverton Honiton, in Devon - that will prompt a new leadership crisis. They also believe the scandal over lockdown parties in Downing Street is far from over, with the Commons privileges committee still to look into whether the PM misled Parliament when he denied parties had been held in downing street and insisted all rules had been followed. That could unearth new evidence - and the conclusions could be highly damaging. Last night's confidence vote result does not resolve the debate on Boris Johnson's future. As one senior backbencher put it, it means the prime minster thinks he can stay on - but the rebels think they are within touching distance of bringing him down. Read Nick's full analysis In the confidence vote, triggered by Partygate, Mr Johnson was backed by 211 Conservative MPs, but 148 voted to remove him. Mr Johnson hailed this as a ""decisive"" victory - and on Tuesday morning told a cabinet meeting his ""fundamental Conservative instinct"" was to allow people to decide how to spend their money. He urged cabinet ministers to find ways to make savings and told them ""delivering tax cuts"" would help deliver ""considerable growth in employment and economic progress"". But Labour's shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said Mr Johnson did not have ""any sense of honour"" and should resign. Speaking to BBC News, she said Tory MPs who voted to keep the PM in office were ""just not listening to the scale of frustration and anger across the country"". ""There's really got to be some consequences when someone just isn't telling the truth, isn't fit for office, isn't taking the action the country needs"". Mr Johnson won the confidence of 59% of his MPs, however, his critics have noted that his predecessor Theresa May secured the support of 63% when she faced her own confidence vote but was still forced out of office six months later. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey described Mr Johnson as a ""lying lawbreaker"" who was ""clinging on by the skin of his teeth"" while SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford likened him to a ""dead man walking"". ""Whether it's by Tory MPs finally acting in a responsible manner or indeed the Privileges Committee taking action against him, he will be gone,"" Mr Blackford said.

"Dom Phillips talking to two indigenous men in Roraima State, Brazil in 2019 The family of veteran British journalist Dom Phillips is urging more action be taken to find him after he went missing in the Brazilian Amazon. Mr Phillips, 57, disappeared along with Brazilian indigenous expert Bruno AraÃºjo Pereira in a remote rainforest area while researching a book. The two had received threats days before vanishing on Sunday morning, say indigenous rights groups. Both men have deep knowledge of the region. Forty-one-year-old Bruno Pereira, who is currently on leave from his post with the government's indigenous affairs agency Funai, is an expert on isolated tribes in the Amazon. Mr Phillips has been living in Brazil for more than a decade and is a long-time contributor to Britain's Guardian newspaper as well as other publications such as the Financial Times and the Washington Post. He has written extensively about the threats facing the Amazon, includinghow cattle farming is fuelling an environmental crisis,externalandhow illegal gold miners encroach on indigenous territory,external. Two indigenous rights groups sounded the alarm about the men's disappearance on Monday. Dom Phillips visiting Aldeia Maloca PapiÃº, Roraima State, Brazil in 2019 In a statement,external[in Portuguese], they said that the two men had been travelling by boat in the Javari Valley to interview members of an indigenous guard. The area is located in the west of Amazonas state, near the border with Peru, and has seen incursions from illegal loggers and miners. On Sunday, the two stopped in SÃ£o Rafael, where Mr Pereira was scheduled to meet a local leader to discuss joint patrols between indigenous people and residents of riverside communities. According to the rights groups, Mr Phillips and Mr Pereira arrived at 06:00 local time and set off shortly afterwards towards Atalaia do Norte, a journey which takes around two hours. When they failed to arrive, Univaja sent out a search party at around 14:00 but found no trace of the two men along the stretch of river they had been expected to take. The last to see them were residents of SÃ£o Gabriel, a community downriver from SÃ£o Rafael, who spotted their boat going past, the statement adds. Police say they interviewed two people who are thought to be among the last to have seen the men. The witnesses were taken to Atalaia do Nore, where they were interviewed, but no arrests were made. The rights groups say Mr Phillips and Mr Pereira were traveling in a new boat and had enough fuel to cover their journey. They add that in the week leading up to the men's disappearance, the team had received threats. ""It wasn't the first time threats were made,"" the statement says, adding that previous instances had been reported to the police. The area is home to more than 20 indigenous groups, who have denounced activities by illegal miners, fishers and hunters. Amazon shootout: Illegal miners exploit lax enforcement A Funai base in the region has come under attack on a number of occasions in recent years. Mr Phillips' family has been appealing to the authorities to speed up the search. His Brazilian wife, Alessandra Sampaio, wrote ""our families are in despair, please answer the urgency of the moment with urgent actions"". ""In the forest every second counts, every second could be the difference between life and death,"" she added. Mr Phillips' sister, Sian Phillips, also appealed for help in a video statement. This video can not be played Watch: Sian Phillips makes a tearful plea for her brother's safety Mr Pereira's family has also released a statement describing the ""48 hours of anguish"" they have lived through since the disappearance. The statement says that the family is hopeful that their disappearance may be down to their boat breaking down and that the two ""are waiting for help"". ""We know that Bruno [Pereira] has extensive experience and knowledge of the region, however, time is a key factor in rescue operations, especially if they turn out to be injured."" The Brazilian government said that the federal police force was ""immediately mobilised"" and was ""taking all possible measures"" to find the two. But there has been criticism of the small number of police and navy personnel deployed in what is a vast expanse of rainforest crisscrossed by rivers. The navy only announced late on Monday that it would send a helicopter ""in addition to two vessels and a watercraft"". Mr Pereira's family has insisted that it is ""essential that specialized searches are carried out, by air, river and land, with all the human and material resources that the situation requires"".

"The UAE's decision to join the chorus against India is quite significant India's diplomatic nightmare over controversial comments made by two senior officials of the country's ruling party about the Prophet Muhammad is showing no signs of ending. The UAE, Oman, Indonesia, Iraq, the Maldives, Jordan, Libya and Bahrain have joined the growing list of countries in the Islamic world that have condemned the remarks. Earlier, Kuwait, Iran and Qatar had called Indian ambassadors to register their protest, and Saudi Arabia had issued a strongly worded statement. Indian diplomats have been trying to placate these countries - it shares cordial relations with most of them - but the storm is far from over. At the centre of this controversy is Nupur Sharma, who was a spokesperson of the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). She made the remark in a televised debate last month, and videos of her statement had gone viral. Naveen Jindal, who was media head of the party's Delhi unit, had also posted a provocative tweet on the issue. Who is Nupur Sharma? Critics say Ms Sharma and Mr Jindal's comments reflect the deep religious polarisation that the country has been witnessing over the past few years.Hate speech and attacks against Muslimshave risen sharply since the BJP came to power in 2014. Their comments - especially Ms Sharma's - angered the country's minority Muslim community, leading to sporadic protests in some states. The BBC is not repeating Ms Sharma's remarks as they are offensive in nature. The two leaders have issued public apologies and the party has suspended Ms Sharma and expelled Mr Jindal. ""The BJP strongly denounces insults of any religious personalities of any religion. The BJP is also against any ideology which insults or demeans any sect or religion. The BJP does not promote such people or philosophy,"" it said in a statement. Nupur Sharma made the offensive remarks in a TV debate last month But experts say that the BJP's response may not be enough after what looked like the country's internal matter took an international turn. The anger in the Islamic world is evident from some of the statements from these countries. Qatar said it expected a public apology from India. ""Allowing such Islamophobic remarks to continue without punishment, constitutes a grave danger to the protection of human rights and may lead to further prejudice and marginalisation, which will create a cycle of violence and hate,"" Qatar's ministry of foreign affairs said. Saudi Arabia also used some strong words in its statement. ""The Ministry of Foreign Affairs expressed its condemnation and denunciation of the statements made by the spokeswoman of the BJP,"" it said. India's ambassador to Qatar, Deepak Mittal, said the remarks from some ""fringe elements"" did not represent the views of the Indian government. Senior BJP leaders and other diplomats have also condemned the controversial statement. The 57-member Organisation of the Islamic Conference (OIC) and Pakistan have also criticised India.But Delhi criticised both,external, as it usually does, saying their comments were ""unwarranted and narrow-minded"". Analysts say that the top leadership of the party and the government may have to make public statements on the issue. Not doing so, they say, runs the risk of damaging India's ties with the Arab world and Iran. India's trade with the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), which includes Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Oman and the UAE, stood at $87 billion in 2020-21. Millions of Indians live and work in these countries and send millions of dollars in remittances back home. The region is also the top source for India's energy imports. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been a regular visitor to the region since coming to power in 2014. The country has already signed a free trade agreement with the UAE and is in talks with the GCC for a wider deal. Mr Modi famously attended the ground-breaking ceremony of the first Hindu temple in Abu Dhabi in 2018 - it was termed as an example of the growing ties between India and the region. Against this backdrop, the UAE's decision to join the chorus against India is quite significant. The relations between the two countries have significantly improved in the past few years. The UAE has also backed India at multi-nation forums. Experts said the controversy could overshadow some of India's recent diplomatic successes with the UAE and other nations. While Delhi's relations with Tehran have been lukewarm over the past few years, the controversy could overshadow Iranian foreign minister Hossein Amir Abdollahian's upcoming visit to India. Another former diplomat Anil Trigunayat, who has served in the Arab world, said that India was in a difficult situation and only sincere efforts at the leadership level could prevent negative fallout. Millions of Indians live and work in the Gulf countries Other analysts say the diplomatic cost from the fallout could greatly hurt India's interests in the region. ""Indian officials often react defensively when foreign capitals, including close friends of New Delhi, criticise Indian domestic matters. But in this case, expect Indian diplomats to work quickly to defuse tensions with apologies and other forms of damage control,"" said Michael Kugelman, deputy director of the Asia Program at the Wilson Center think-tank. Arab nations are also looking to take concrete action to soothe anger among their own people. Hashtags criticising India have been trending in these countries and the incident has been the top story in their media outlets. Some of these hashtags have called for a boycott of Indian products. There have also been reports of some stores in Qatar and Kuwait removing Indian products from their shelves. A sign in Arabic at the Al-Ardiya Co-Operative Society supermarket in Kuwait read:""We have removed Indian products."",external But analysts, including Mr Kugelman, believe that despite the public display of anger, the relationship was important to both the GCC and India and both sides would be looking at mitigating the risks. ""As concerned as Delhi should be about this angry response from such a strategically critical region, India is also shielded from further damage by its own clout. Because of their economic interests, Gulf states need India to keep importing their energy, they need Indians to continue living and working there, and overall, they need to keep doing business with India,"" he said. He added that there might be limits to how far these countries would go in responding to these anti-Muslim comments. Critics say that religious polarisation has increased in India since the BJP came to power. And the past few weeks have been particularly tense aftersome Hindu groups went to a local court in Varanasito seek permission to pray at a centuries-old mosque, claiming that it was built on the ruins of a demolished temple. TV channels have held provocative debates and social media has seen rampant hate over the issue. Many people associated with right-wing organisations often make controversial statements on TV shows, but critics say Ms Sharma wasn't a ""fringe element"" as the BJP has claimed. She was an official spokesperson of the party, tasked with representing the BJP's views. Analysts add that the international fallout over the controversy should be a wake-up call for India and it should learn that divisive politics can have international ramifications. ""Delhi is learning that when it comes to the country's increasingly toxic politics, what happens in India often doesn't stay in India. As India's global clout grows and its diplomatic and economic partnerships abroad become stronger, there's more at stake when its domestic politics cause unhappiness abroad,"" Mr Kugelman said.

At the centre of this controversy is Nupur Sharma, who was a spokesperson of the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). She made the remark in a televised debate last month, and videos of her statement had gone viral. Naveen Jindal, who was media head of the party's Delhi unit, had also posted a provocative tweet on the issue. Who is Nupur Sharma? Critics say Ms Sharma and Mr Jindal's comments reflect the deep religious polarisation that the country has been witnessing over the past few years.Hate speech and attacks against Muslimshave risen sharply since the BJP came to power in 2014. Their comments - especially Ms Sharma's - angered the country's minority Muslim community, leading to sporadic protests in some states. The BBC is not repeating Ms Sharma's remarks as they are offensive in nature. The two leaders have issued public apologies and the party has suspended Ms Sharma and expelled Mr Jindal. ""The BJP strongly denounces insults of any religious personalities of any religion. The BJP is also against any ideology which insults or demeans any sect or religion. The BJP does not promote such people or philosophy,"" it said in a statement. Nupur Sharma made the offensive remarks in a TV debate last month But experts say that the BJP's response may not be enough after what looked like the country's internal matter took an international turn. The anger in the Islamic world is evident from some of the statements from these countries. Qatar said it expected a public apology from India. ""Allowing such Islamophobic remarks to continue without punishment, constitutes a grave danger to the protection of human rights and may lead to further prejudice and marginalisation, which will create a cycle of violence and hate,"" Qatar's ministry of foreign affairs said. Saudi Arabia also used some strong words in its statement. ""The Ministry of Foreign Affairs expressed its condemnation and denunciation of the statements made by the spokeswoman of the BJP,"" it said. India's ambassador to Qatar, Deepak Mittal, said the remarks from some ""fringe elements"" did not represent the views of the Indian government. Senior BJP leaders and other diplomats have also condemned the controversial statement. The 57-member Organisation of the Islamic Conference (OIC) and Pakistan have also criticised India.But Delhi criticised both,external, as it usually does, saying their comments were ""unwarranted and narrow-minded"". Analysts say that the top leadership of the party and the government may have to make public statements on the issue. Not doing so, they say, runs the risk of damaging India's ties with the Arab world and Iran. India's trade with the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), which includes Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Oman and the UAE, stood at $87 billion in 2020-21. Millions of Indians live and work in these countries and send millions of dollars in remittances back home. The region is also the top source for India's energy imports. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been a regular visitor to the region since coming to power in 2014. The country has already signed a free trade agreement with the UAE and is in talks with the GCC for a wider deal. Mr Modi famously attended the ground-breaking ceremony of the first Hindu temple in Abu Dhabi in 2018 - it was termed as an example of the growing ties between India and the region. Against this backdrop, the UAE's decision to join the chorus against India is quite significant. The relations between the two countries have significantly improved in the past few years. The UAE has also backed India at multi-nation forums. Experts said the controversy could overshadow some of India's recent diplomatic successes with the UAE and other nations. While Delhi's relations with Tehran have been lukewarm over the past few years, the controversy could overshadow Iranian foreign minister Hossein Amir Abdollahian's upcoming visit to India. Another former diplomat Anil Trigunayat, who has served in the Arab world, said that India was in a difficult situation and only sincere efforts at the leadership level could prevent negative fallout. Millions of Indians live and work in the Gulf countries Other analysts say the diplomatic cost from the fallout could greatly hurt India's interests in the region. ""Indian officials often react defensively when foreign capitals, including close friends of New Delhi, criticise Indian domestic matters. But in this case, expect Indian diplomats to work quickly to defuse tensions with apologies and other forms of damage control,"" said Michael Kugelman, deputy director of the Asia Program at the Wilson Center think-tank. Arab nations are also looking to take concrete action to soothe anger among their own people. Hashtags criticising India have been trending in these countries and the incident has been the top story in their media outlets. Some of these hashtags have called for a boycott of Indian products. There have also been reports of some stores in Qatar and Kuwait removing Indian products from their shelves. A sign in Arabic at the Al-Ardiya Co-Operative Society supermarket in Kuwait read:""We have removed Indian products."",external But analysts, including Mr Kugelman, believe that despite the public display of anger, the relationship was important to both the GCC and India and both sides would be looking at mitigating the risks. ""As concerned as Delhi should be about this angry response from such a strategically critical region, India is also shielded from further damage by its own clout. Because of their economic interests, Gulf states need India to keep importing their energy, they need Indians to continue living and working there, and overall, they need to keep doing business with India,"" he said. He added that there might be limits to how far these countries would go in responding to these anti-Muslim comments. Critics say that religious polarisation has increased in India since the BJP came to power. And the past few weeks have been particularly tense aftersome Hindu groups went to a local court in Varanasito seek permission to pray at a centuries-old mosque, claiming that it was built on the ruins of a demolished temple. TV channels have held provocative debates and social media has seen rampant hate over the issue. Many people associated with right-wing organisations often make controversial statements on TV shows, but critics say Ms Sharma wasn't a ""fringe element"" as the BJP has claimed. She was an official spokesperson of the party, tasked with representing the BJP's views. Analysts add that the international fallout over the controversy should be a wake-up call for India and it should learn that divisive politics can have international ramifications. ""Delhi is learning that when it comes to the country's increasingly toxic politics, what happens in India often doesn't stay in India. As India's global clout grows and its diplomatic and economic partnerships abroad become stronger, there's more at stake when its domestic politics cause unhappiness abroad,"" Mr Kugelman said.

"This video can not be played Volodymyr Zelensky says he is ""very happy"" Boris Johnson remains UK prime minister Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said he was ""very happy"" Boris Johnson was still UK prime minister after he survived an attempt to oust him. Mr Johnson won a confidence vote despite a major revolt that saw 148 of his own Tory MPs vote to remove him. ""I'm glad we haven't lost an important ally, this is great news,"" Mr Zelensky said at an online event. Mr Johnson has forged a close relationship with President Zelensky since Russia's invasion of Ukraine. He called Mr Johnson a ""true friend of Ukraine"" and a ""concrete"" supporter in an interview at a virtual conference hosted by the Financial Times on Tuesday. The UK was among the first to provide weapons to support Ukraine's defence and - like its Western allies - has imposed sweeping sanctions on Russian targets prosecuting the war. In April, Mr Johnson pledged ""unwavering support"" ona visit to the capital Kyiv, where he did an unannounced walkabout of the city with President Zelensky. This video can not be played Watch: Boris Johnson and Volodymyr Zelensky tour Kyiv's near-empty streets Mr Johnson has faced a backlash from MPs and the public after he was fined by police for breaking his own lockdown laws at a 2020 party in Downing Street, where the prime minister lives and works. A report by a senior civil servant criticised failures of leadership in Downing Street, where officials and staff were issued with a total of 123 fines for breaking Covid rules on indoor gatherings during the pandemic. Some Conservative MPs had cited the war in Ukraine as a reason not to oust Mr Johnson from office in the confidence vote in Parliament on Monday. Rallying his MPs ahead of the vote, Mr Johnson said it was the wrong time for ""unforced domestic political drama"" when Ukraine was fighting Russian President Vladimir Putin's forces. Mr Johnson won the backing of 59% of his MPs, describing the result as ""extremely good, positive, conclusive"" and insisting his leadership was now secure. LIVE: Fallout of Johnson's confidence vote win What happens next after confidence vote? Chris Mason: PM's opponents are not defeated However, those who had voted against Mr Johnson said the scale of the rebellion had weakened his authority, with some calling on him to resign. Reacting to Monday night's result, cabinet minister Nadhim Zahawi said he thought President Zelensky would be ""punching the air because he knows his great ally Boris Johnson will be prime minister tomorrow morning"". Those comments were criticised by some MPs, includingLabour's Karl Turner,external, who urged Mr Zahawi to apologise for dragging the Ukrainian president ""into this Tory party civil war"". On Monday, ahead of the confidence vote, Mr Johnson called Mr Zelensky to discuss Ukraine's defence of its eastern Donbas region, where Russian forces are advancing. In a tweet,external, Mr Johnson wrote: ""We're unwavering in our mission of ensuring Ukraine is defended and supported for the long-term."" The UK's military support to Ukraine amounts to Â£750m so far and includes thousands of anti-tank missiles, 20 armoured vehicles, 4.5 tonnes of plastic explosives, and electronic warfare kit. On top of this,the UK says,externalit is providing Â£220m of humanitarian assistance to Ukraine. As a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP), the UK was the sixth largest donor of aid to Ukraine globally between January and May,according to research by the Kiel Institute for the World Economy,external. Last month, the UK government said it would offer further aid and military support to Ukraine worth Â£1.3bn to boost the country's defence against Russia. Mr Johnson spoke to President Zelensky on the phone ahead of the confidence vote on Monday Ukrainian commentators and officials expressed relief that Mr Johnson had won Monday's confidence vote, with some noting that UK had become a key arms supplier for the country. Mykhaylo Podolyak, one of Mr Zelensky's advisers, tweeted in English moments after the confidence vote. He wrote,external: ""Leadership is always a heavy burden. Boris Johnson was one of the first who realised the menace of Russia & stood by Volodymyr Zelensky to protect the free world from barbaric invasion. ""The world needs such leaders. The UK is a Great friend of Ukraine. British crown is a shield of democratic world.""

"Atul Gupta with South African president Jacob Zuma in 2011 Two brothers from the wealthy Gupta family have been arrested in the United Arab Emirates, the South African and Emirati authorities have announced. Atul and Rajesh Gupta are accused in South Africa of profiting from their close links with former president Jacob Zuma and exerting unfair influence. Extradition talks are taking place between the two countries. The brothers fled South Africa after a judicial commission began probing their involvement in corruption in 2018. They are accused of paying financial bribes in order to win lucrative state contracts and influence powerful government appointments. They deny any wrongdoing. A statement from Dubai Police said the two men were being held ""in connection with money laundering and criminal charges in South Africa"". The force said it acted after receiving an Interpol ""red notice"" - a request to law enforcement organisations to provisionally arrest a wanted person pending extradition. A third brother, Ajay, is also wanted by the South African authorities, but it is not clear why he was not arrested. The Gupta family moved from India to South Africa in 1993. They also face accusations of money laundering in India, where tax officials raided properties belonging to them in 2018 in multiple cities, including their company office in capital Delhi. Many of the most serious corruption allegations levelled against the Indian-born brothers focus on their relationship with Jacob Zuma, who was president of South Africa from 2009 until he was forced to step down amid a storm of corruption allegations nine years later. The Gupta family is accused of using their close links with Mr Zuma to wield enormous political power across all levels of South African government - winning business contracts, influencing high-profile government appointments and misappropriating state funds. Mr Zuma, along with the Guptas, denies the allegations. After the brothers fled the country, South Africa negotiated an extradition treaty with the UAE in 2021. President Cyril Ramaphosa's government has said it hoped the agreement would lead to the return of the Guptas to face charges, but it was not immediately clear following the arrests whether the brothers would return to South Africa. More about the Guptas in South Africa: South Africa and the fable of the missing Guptas Who are the Guptas? How the Guptas' brand turned toxic Long read: The many trials of Jacob Zuma The Gupta family became so closely linked with Mr Zuma that a joint term was even coined for them - ""the Zuptas"". One of Mr Zuma's wives, as well as a son and daughter, worked in senior roles for Gupta-controlled companies. Many of the companies in the Gupta portfolio profited from lucrative contracts with government departments and state-owned corporations - where public officials say they were directly instructed by the family to take decisions that would advance the brothers' business interests. It is alleged that compliance was rewarded with money and promotion, while disobedience was punished with dismissal. The list of public bodies accused of having been ""captured"" is extensive - the ministries of finance, natural resources and public enterprises, as well as agencies responsible for tax collection and communications, the national broadcaster SABC, the national carrier, South African Airways, the state-owned rail-freight operator and the energy giant Eskom - one of the largest utility companies on the planet. A four-year investigation later published by the country's top judge concluded that the brothers had become deeply embedded in the highest levels of government and Mr Zuma's ruling African National Congress (ANC) party. Reports published this year by investigators accused the brothers of being linked to racketeering activity through the procurement of rail, ports and pipeline infrastructure. Its authors also concluded that Mr Zuma ""would do anything that the Guptas wanted him to do for them"". Last year, Mr Zuma was imprisoned for 15 months for refusing to testify before the same investigators. He was released on parole after serving two months of his sentence in jail. Ajay, Atul and Rajesh Gupta moved to South Africa from the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh in 1993, just as white-minority rule was ending. It is said that when Atul arrived to set up the family business, Sahara Computers, he was amazed by the lack of red tape. They grew the company to employ more than 10,000 people in South Africa, also developing financial interests in the mining, air travel, energy, technology and media sectors.

"Almost 1.8 million children missed at least 10% of school in the autumn term in England, according to the children's commissioner for England Parents in England are being hit with an increasing number of fines as schools try to encourage children to stop missing school. The number of non-attendance fines being handed out dropped off during the pandemic, as self-isolation rules and lockdowns led to millions of children learning at home. But there has been growing concern since it was revealed thatalmost 1.8 million children regularly missed schoolin the first term of this academic year. As part of a mission to tackle this, parents have been fined Â£3.7m for the school year so far, figures obtained by the BBC show. Year 10 pupil Olivia missed every other day of school at her lowest point in the last two years, after family tensions at home. For a while she was living with her older sister, who didn't try to make her go to school, and soon Olivia was barely leaving the house - becoming more isolated and depressed as she spent her days scrolling through her phone. ""I didn't want to see anyone, I didn't want to talk,"" she says. ""I was in such a negative mindset - I didn't care about school, I didn't care about my grades."" Olivia goes to Unity City Academy in Middlesbrough, which six years ago had the worst attendance record in north-east England. Olivia felt isolated and depressed when she stopped going to school After a massive effort, the school's attendance is back up to the national average. Staff members such as Katie Coates and Emma Dryden are part of a drive to keep that number high. At nine in the morning, they work their way through a list of phone numbers of parents of Year 10 pupils who haven't arrived. Some parents just don't answer. Others say their child is on the way, or being kept off because of a doctor or dentist appointment. The job requires a mixture of tact, kindness and toughness as they try to work out which families need extra help to get the teenagers back to school. LISTEN: Getting children back into school Almost two million pupils regularly missing school Search begins for 100,000 absent pupils in England For some families there are financial barriers, with one pupil messaging to say they don't have trousers to wear into school. Katie says a uniform bank within the school has been set up to help remove that barrier, but building trust with families can be tough. ""Some people aren't brave enough to come forward and say they can't afford things. Some parents can't afford the dinner money and it's cheaper to keep them at home."" Katie Coates works with families to try to encourage children into school Parents have also been known to keep older children off school to look after younger siblings. Katie says persuading parents to encourage their children into school can be difficult, as many families face ""heart-wrenching"" struggles. Every morning, Katie's colleague Emma knocks on the doors of any parents who haven't picked up the phone to explain why their child isn't in school. At most of the visits, the curtains are closed and door stays shut, so a leaflet goes into the letterbox asking parents to contact the school if they need help. At one house where there is no answer, the pupil had only been into school four days in the last three months. Emma says they tried arranging late starts, early finishes, taxis and meetings with parents - but have had no success encouraging the child to come to school. If none of those tactics work, parents with persistently absent children will get a Â£60 fixed penalty notice, which rises to Â£120 if it is not paid within weeks. Huge leap in children in mental health crisis Parents and teachers step in to oversee exams Covid closures still affecting 400 million pupils In the school year 2018-19, just before the pandemic, more than 272,000 fines with a total value of Â£14m were issued to parents in England for their children's non-attendance. Our investigation has found fines are now increasing again. Just over 71,000 fines were issued this school year up to Easter, costing parents a total of Â£3.7m. Out of the 152 local authorities, 130 replied to our request for data for the last four years.

"Almost 1.8 million children missed at least 10% of school in the autumn term in England, according to the children's commissioner for England Parents in England are being hit with an increasing number of fines as schools try to encourage children to stop missing school. The number of non-attendance fines being handed out dropped off during the pandemic, as self-isolation rules and lockdowns led to millions of children learning at home. But there has been growing concern since it was revealed thatalmost 1.8 million children regularly missed schoolin the first term of this academic year. As part of a mission to tackle this, parents have been fined Â£3.7m for the school year so far, figures obtained by the BBC show. Year 10 pupil Olivia missed every other day of school at her lowest point in the last two years, after family tensions at home. For a while she was living with her older sister, who didn't try to make her go to school, and soon Olivia was barely leaving the house - becoming more isolated and depressed as she spent her days scrolling through her phone. ""I didn't want to see anyone, I didn't want to talk,"" she says. ""I was in such a negative mindset - I didn't care about school, I didn't care about my grades."" Olivia goes to Unity City Academy in Middlesbrough, which six years ago had the worst attendance record in north-east England. Olivia felt isolated and depressed when she stopped going to school After a massive effort, the school's attendance is back up to the national average. Staff members such as Katie Coates and Emma Dryden are part of a drive to keep that number high. At nine in the morning, they work their way through a list of phone numbers of parents of Year 10 pupils who haven't arrived. Some parents just don't answer. Others say their child is on the way, or being kept off because of a doctor or dentist appointment. The job requires a mixture of tact, kindness and toughness as they try to work out which families need extra help to get the teenagers back to school. LISTEN: Getting children back into school Almost two million pupils regularly missing school Search begins for 100,000 absent pupils in England For some families there are financial barriers, with one pupil messaging to say they don't have trousers to wear into school. Katie says a uniform bank within the school has been set up to help remove that barrier, but building trust with families can be tough. ""Some people aren't brave enough to come forward and say they can't afford things. Some parents can't afford the dinner money and it's cheaper to keep them at home."" Katie Coates works with families to try to encourage children into school Parents have also been known to keep older children off school to look after younger siblings. Katie says persuading parents to encourage their children into school can be difficult, as many families face ""heart-wrenching"" struggles. Every morning, Katie's colleague Emma knocks on the doors of any parents who haven't picked up the phone to explain why their child isn't in school. At most of the visits, the curtains are closed and door stays shut, so a leaflet goes into the letterbox asking parents to contact the school if they need help. At one house where there is no answer, the pupil had only been into school four days in the last three months. Emma says they tried arranging late starts, early finishes, taxis and meetings with parents - but have had no success encouraging the child to come to school. If none of those tactics work, parents with persistently absent children will get a Â£60 fixed penalty notice, which rises to Â£120 if it is not paid within weeks. Huge leap in children in mental health crisis Parents and teachers step in to oversee exams Covid closures still affecting 400 million pupils In the school year 2018-19, just before the pandemic, more than 272,000 fines with a total value of Â£14m were issued to parents in England for their children's non-attendance. Our investigation has found fines are now increasing again. Just over 71,000 fines were issued this school year up to Easter, costing parents a total of Â£3.7m. Out of the 152 local authorities, 130 replied to our request for data for the last four years. The number of fines issued to parents varies between councils and ministers want a more consistent approach. At Unity City Academy, the decision to put forward cases for parents to be fined is one small part of the work to encourage pupils to turn up each day. Andy Rodgers, the principal, says the school has invested in making school more enjoyable and rewarding, and improving behaviour.

"The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have shared a picture of their daughter Lilibet after celebrating her first birthday. Lilibet is seen smiling at a birthday picnic hosted by the couple at Frogmore Cottage in Windsor. Prince Harry and Meghan said they were ""incredibly touched"" by birthday wishes they received for their second child, who was named in honour of the Queen. It comes after theyvisited the UK for the Platinum Jubilee. On Friday, the Sussexes made their first public appearance in Britain together since 2020when they attended a service of thanksgiving for the Queen at St Paul's Cathedral. The couple were alsopictured watching Trooping the Colour from a window, but were not part of the carriage procession or the group of working royals and their children permitted on the balcony of Buckingham Palace. Last week, was the first opportunity for the 96-year-old monarch to meet her great-grandaughter, who was born in Santa Barbara, California, where the Sussexes now liveafter stepping back as senior working royals. But there has been no confirmation whether or not the Queen has met Lilibet. Lilbet has inherited the copper locks of the Duke of Sussex, who is pictured aged one with his father, the Prince of Wales Lilibet,who celebrated her first birthday on Saturday, is pictured dressed in a pale blue frock with a white bow in her hair. The photo was taken by a family friend Misan Harriman at a picnic attended by family and close friends, a spokesperson for the duke and duchess said. Royals wish Lilibet a happy first birthday Harry and Meghan navigate a tricky return to duty Who's in the UK Royal Family and how does it work? Professional photographer Mr Harriman latershared a black and white snap on Twitter,externalof Meghan holding Lilibet alongside the words: ""It was such a privilege to celebrate the 1st birthday of Lilibet with my family and hers! Joy and face painting all around."" Mr Harriman previously tookblack-and-white photographs of Meghan and Harrywhen they announced she was pregnant with their second child. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex, who are pictured with the Princess Royal's daughter, Zara Tindall, attended a service of thanksgiving at St Paul's Cathedral for the Queen's Platinum Jubilee Celebrations A spokesperson for the Sussexes said cake was also served at the picnic by thecouple's wedding baker Claire Ptak. They added that more than $100,000 (Â£79,800) worth of donations had been made in their daughter's honour by people around the globe to World Central Kitchen - an organisation providing meals for those affected by humanitarian, climate and community crises. The timing of the release of this photograph seems to be part of Prince Harry and Meghan's determined efforts to keep a low profile during their Platinum Jubilee visit. Lilibet's birthday was on Saturday, but the picture wasn't made public until Monday night, when the Jubilee weekend was over and when there could beno accusations of stealing the limelight from the Queen. There are also no details of which family were there for the birthday party, which fitted in with Buckingham Palace's earlier position that any such family meetings would remain private, including any meeting with the Queen. It's a difficult balancing act for Prince Harry and Meghan, with such intense and fiercely divided public interest surrounding them. They're likely to be criticised if they seem to be courting attention, and blamed if they hide away. And over the Jubilee celebrations they appeared at the St Paul's thanksgiving service, but otherwise stayed below the radar. With this latest photo, they kept their own news out of the spotlight until after the Queen's big weekend. Prince Harry and Meghan named Lilibet after the Royal Family's nickname for the Queen, the toddler's great-grandmother. Her middle name, Diana, was chosen to honour her ""beloved late grandmother"", the Princess of Wales, the couple said at the time of her birth last year. Allow Twitter content?

"The study found no clear evidence of a change in consumption for those who drink at harmful levels Drinkers who suffered the worst effects of alcoholism did not change their habits when Scotland's minimum pricing was introduced,a study has shown.,external Public Health Scotland (PHS) reported minimum unit pricing (MUP) led to some people cutting back on food and energy. All licensed premises have had to charge at least 50p per unit of alcohol since MUP was introduced in May 2018. The Scottish government said it would review the final evaluation report from PHS before drawing conclusions. The level of alcohol MUP was initially set in 2012, with the introduction of the policy delayed until 2018 by a lengthy legal challenge in the years before its introduction. Study finds cross-border alcohol buying is minimal Calls to raise minimum unit alcohol price to 65p Alcohol off-sales drop credited to minimum pricing In May 2021, a study found MUP had already had a lasting impact in Scotland, and that alcohol sales had fallen by 8%. However, the latest study published by PHS found no clear evidence of a change in consumption or severity of dependence in those who suffered the worst affects of drinking alcohol. The poorest groups experienced ""increased financial strain"" as the price rises meant they were spending more on drinks. Some people then cut back on other expenditure, such as on food and utility bills. The study, by the University of Sheffield, the University of Newcastle (Australia) and Figure 8 Consultancy Services,  looked at the ""hard to reach"" population of people who drank alcohol at harmful levels, including those dependent on alcohol and those accessing treatment services. In its final report on the study, PHS said researchers found there was also no clear evidence minimum pricing caused negative consequences - such as increased crime, a shift to illicit substances or acute withdrawal - among Scots drinking at harmful levels. Helen Chung Patterson, PHS public health intelligence adviser, said people who drank at harmful levels were a ""diverse group with complex needs"" who could have multiple health and social problems. ""They are therefore unlikely to respond to MUP in one single or simple way,"" she said. ""Many are likely to drink low-cost high-strength alcohol affected by MUP and are at greatest risk from their alcohol consumption. ""This population therefore have the potential to benefit the most from MUP but may also continue to experience harms."" Alcohol deaths increased in Scotland in 2020 Prof John Holmes, director of the Sheffield Alcohol Research Group, led the study. He said people with alcohol dependence responded to MUP in different ways. ""Some reduced their spending on other things but others switched to lower-strength drinks or simply bought less alcohol,"" he said. ""It is important that alcohol treatment services and other organisations find ways to support those who do have financial problems, particularly as inflation rises."" Last year, a group of charities and medical experts urged the Scottish government toincrease the minimum unit price (MUP) of alcohol from 50p to 65p, arguing that the positive effects of the policy would be reduced by inflation and the pandemic. A Scottish government spokeswoman said it would ""carefully consider the findings"" of the ""large and complex study"". Noting that in the year after MUP was introduced there was a 2% decrease in off-trade alcohol sales and a 10% decrease in alcohol specific deaths, she said 2020 showed a 17% increase in alcohol-specific deaths in Scotland. ""It is too early to know whether the changed drinking behaviours during the pandemic are temporary or not, however work on reviewing the level of the minimum unit price MUP is under way, she said. ""We will review the final evaluation report from Public Health Scotland before drawing overall conclusions."" Laura Mahon, deputy chief executive of Alcohol Focus Scotland, welcomed the report. She said: ""Before MUP was introduced there was limited understanding of what effect the policy might have on this group. ""It's encouraging to see that there do not appear to be widespread negative consequences on dependent drinkers. ""However, this study gives us much needed information about the additional support required by the groups included in the research. "" Ms Mahon added that investment was needed in recovery-oriented alcohol services to ensure people got the right support to help them cope with the underlying reasons for drinking.

"Boris Johnson remains as Conservative leader after winning a vote of his own MPs The MPs voted by 211 to 148 to keep him as party leader and prime minister At a cabinet meeting on Tuesday, he says he wants to ""draw a line"" under his problems Supporters - and some opponents - of the PM also say it's time to move on Foreign Secretary Liz Truss emphatically backs the PM and dismisses suggestions of a leadership bid ""I think [the PM] won the vote comprehensively,"" says Johnson critic Andrea Leadsom But former leader Lord Hague says the damage done to Johnson is severe Meanwhile, Ukraine's President Zelensky says he is ""very happy"" that Johnson remains PM Edited by Marie Jackson That's it for now but if you still want more, follow our latest news storyhere. Our live coverage today was written by Joseph Lee, Sam Hancock, Alex Kleiderman and Craig Hutchison. It was edited by Owen Amos and Marie Jackson. The bunting came down at No 10 as Boris Johnson promised a renewed focus on the government's agenda We're bringing our live coverage of the fall-out from last night's confidence vote to a close shortly. But here's a round-up of what we learned today: Daniel DaviesBBC Wales political correspondent There was a sense of resignation in the centre of Brecon after Conservative MPs voted to back Boris Johnson. âItâs almost a case of better the devil you know really,â one man told me. We heard the sentiment more than once from people who didnât see an obvious alternative leader in a seat the Tories reclaimed from the Liberal Democrats in 2019. Dawn McIntosh says she is ""on the fence"" about Boris Johnson but is sticking with his party At her carpet and flooring business, Youngs, in the town
centre, Dawn McIntosh said she would stick with the Conservatives. She was âon the fenceâ about Johnson, but thought ânow
would definitely be the wrong timeâ to change the leader. Malcolm MacDonald, whose family have a fish stall in the
town market, said the prime minister had been the subject of a âwitch huntâ. âJohnson has got a lot of faults, but so has everybody,â he
said. âHe looks like a clown, but heâs not as big a clown as
everyone thinks he is.â Malcolm MacDonald: ""Heâs not as big a clown as everyone thinks he is"" Giles Watling is pictured here in 2014 with former prime minister David Cameron Giles Watling, one of the Tory MPs who sided against Boris Johnson on Monday, says the prime minister made some ""slightly foolish"" comments on Partygate before the vote. Speaking to backbenchers in the 1922 Committee, Johnson reportedly defended his appearance at leaving dos that led some Downing Street staff to receive fines for breaking lockdown rules saying he would ""do it again"". Clacton MP Watling says: ""We all made sacrifices during lockdown. ""Sadly I lost one of my sisters and I wasn't able to see her as much as I'd liked because of lockdown. ""Now, I understand the feelings of people out there who went through quite some privation."" Reality Check In
December 2018, Jacob Rees-Mogg spoke to the BBC about the result of the
confidence vote in Theresa May. The
then prime minister won the vote with 63% of Conservative MPs
backing her, somewhat better than the 59% who supported Boris Johnson last
night. At the time,external, Rees-Mogg described the 2018 verdict as âa terrible result for the
prime minister... The prime minister must realise that under all constitutional
norms she ought to go and see the Queen urgently and resign.â However,he described,externalJohnsonâs win â with a smaller majority than May â as âa
good victory for the prime minister â he won comfortably â and now he is
getting on with businessâ. On 6 June on Sky News, Rees-Mogg said of his earlier comments on May: âEveryone said to me
afterwards that was absolute nonsense and I had to eat a good deal of my own
words.â Jenny KumahReporting from Tiverton Chris Williams wants a ""better leader"" Tiverton is an ordinary market town in a
traditional rural part of Devon, but around a month a go it was at the centre
of an extraordinary political story. The Conservative MPNeil Parish resigned after admitting watching pornographyin the House of Commons. And on 23 June, people living here
will get to vote for their next MP. So, how are people here feeling about last
night's confidence vote in the PM? Itâs market day here in Tiverton and shopper
Chris Williams says sheâs voted Conservative in the past. âI donât think Boris has much longer to be
our Prime Minister. Itâs regretful but letâs hope somebody else in the
Conservative Party will come forward and perhaps be a better leader."" Sultan Barak wants the PM to stay Out on the High Street, barber Sultan Barak thinks the Tories should move on from Partygate. âHeâs done more than enough, he works hard and is a good prime minister,â Mr Barak said, adding that the PM should stay. Tiverton and Honiton has been a Conservative seat for decades. Neil Parish won with a majority of 24,000 in the 2019 election. But opposition parties are hoping to change all that in the by-election later this month. Jessica ParkerBrussels correspondent Unionists say the protocol has effectively created a border in the sea between Northern Ireland and Great Britain Boris Johnson may now
hope to be seen to be getting on with the business of government but itâs
emerged that a much talked about piece of legislation has been delayed. Tomorrow was pencilled in for the publication of a bill to allow ministers to
potentially override parts of a treaty governing post-Brexit arrangements for
Northern Ireland. The Northern Ireland Protocol was an agreement that Boris
Johnson signed up to, with the EU - but the UK now argues itâs not working and needs
fundamental changes. While Brussels accepts itâs causing trade disruption, on
goods moving from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, it wants any changes to be
within the terms of the treaty. The impasse saw Foreign Secretary Liz Truss
announce plans to override parts of the protocol but the billâs first reading
has now been pushed back until at least Thursday or even next week. Whitehall sources
say thatâs because the legal text isnât quite ready. Itâs a controversial piece
of legislation that Tory MP and former minister Jesse Norman said
yesterday would be economically damaging and illegal, as he withdrew his support
for the Prime Minister. However the Democratic Unionist Party, who are deeply
unhappy with the protocol, today warned Conservative MPs not to oppose the plans. This video can not be played Volodymyr Zelensky said earlier he was ""very happy"" Boris Johnson survived last night's attempt to oust him from Number 10. Speaking to a Financial Times event, the Ukrainian President said he was glad not to have lost an ""important ally"". The pair have formed a close relationship since Russia launched its invasion, with many voters telling the BBC yesterday and today this was the quality of Johnson's leadership they valued most at the moment. More commentary now on Boris Johnson's leadership, after a former policy adviser to David Cameron accuses the government of having ""no vision"" and heading for an ""autumn of discontent"" after yesterday's vote. Camilla Cavendish tells BBC Radio 4's World at One programme that the PM is fond of ""talking about delivering for the people"", but insists there isn't ""anybody [who] can tell you what he is supposed to be deliveringâ. The result, she adds, is a ""deeply split"" party which will start to see a ""slow drip, drip of a loss of momentum for"" the PM over the coming months. Asked who she thinks could replace Johnson, if it comes to that, she says it can't be anyone from his cabinet because they've been ""tarnished"" defending their boss. She suggests MP Tom Tugendhat or former health secretary Jeremy Hunt, instead. âYou need somebody who [can] recognise and respect convention, which is what we haven't got at the moment."" Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent Despite Boris Johnson's significant majority, he will now have to look over his shoulder when it comes to contentious votes and controversial policies. Will those who want him out be harder to win over? There will be efforts to pressure the prime minister to change the way he governs in the next few weeks. One former cabinet minister told me the PM needed to ""cut the culture war crap"". Within government itself there are those who want change too. One minister told me: ""We have a window to show we get itâ¦Things need to change, most of all him."" Read more from Nick here. Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent In theory, the prime minister is safe from another confidence vote for a year. Under the current rules of the 1922 committee, which organises leadership contests, another challenge can't happen for 12 months after the incumbent wins. But not everyone is convinced. ""All this assumption that he's safe for a year - I don't think anyone believes that,"" one backbencher told me this morning. Rebels are already talking about how they could force another vote on Boris Johnson's future. But there are big political pitfalls ahead too, which could change minds. The subject currently dominating talk among Tory MPs is the two by-elections later this month. Then there's Partygate - which isn't over yet. Parliament's privileges committee is due to look into whether the prime minister misled the House of Commons - and sources close to that process believe that could be damning for Mr Johnson. The committee is thought likely to report in the Autumn. Read more from Nick here. Former Brexit minister Lord Frost has said the size of the opposition to the prime minister shows that a change of policy is needed on the economy. He told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme that ""both sides need to accept the vote"". ""The prime minister's opponents have got to accept the fact that he won, and his supporters and the Prime Minister himself have got to accept that a change of policy is needed,"" he said. ""The vote last night, when nearly 150 of your own MPs vote against you, that is a sign of a big problem and I think the big problem is that we are delivering an economic policy that is not going to deliver prosperity and wealth."" He said the government should reverse tax rises such as the National Insurance increase, introduced to tackle the NHS pandemic backlog and to improve social care. ""It is not Conservative to be raising taxes, and it is undermining growth and prosperity,"" he said. Lord Frost resigned from the government in December last year, citing ""concerns about the direction of travel"", including the need to create a ""a lightly regulated, low-tax, entrepreneurial economy"" and fears that Covid policy was too ""coercive"". Liz Truss has backed Boris Johnson after Monday's confidence vote and dismissed suggestions she is launching a leadership bid - saying she is ""100% focused"" on her role as foreign secretary. Truss says a ""clear majority"" of Tory MPs backed the prime minister and it is ""time to move on"". Work on the Ukraine invasion and the Northern Ireland protocol was ""taking up all of my time"", she says. ""We had a vote yesterday... It is time to draw a line, move forward and focus on what people want us to be talking about - housing, childcare and delivering on lower taxes,"" she adds. The government's chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, who helped steer the country through the pandemic, says it was ""very disappointing"" not everyone stuck to the rules.Asked by ITV News about revelations around events held in Downing Street during the pandemic, he said: ""I think it was really important at all stages that everyone stuck to the rules, there's no question about that. ""It only worked when people stuck to them - and it's very disappointing that that wasn't the case."" Sonia Purnell, Boris Johnson's biographer, tellsBBCScotlandâs Lunchtime Livewhy Partygate has not gone away. âMy mother was in a care home, I thought she was safe.
She went into lockdown before the rest of us and I thought 'well thatâs good, sheâll

BBC Radio 5 Live We've been reporting on Boris Johnson's plan to ""draw a line"" under the Partygate saga after yesterday's no-confidence vote, but for some people it isn't that simple. Barbara Garwood, from Derby, spoke to BBC Radio 5 Live earlier about her experience of lockdown. ""For over six months, I didnât see a single person, not anybody. I was stuck in my bungalow on my own and it felt like I was in solitary confinement,"" she said. ""It felt like I'd done something wrong [but] I accepted it and I did it because it was the best thing to do to keep myself safe, but also to keep other people safe. And I did it because it was the law. ""So, to find out that people were drinking and partying... itâs just really insulting."" Boris Johnson survived a vote to oust him last night - but faces some potentially tough tests in the weeks ahead. First come two by-elections this month - contests to replace Conservative MPs who resigned. And another test is expected to take place on 6 July when Johnson is scheduled to appear before MPs on the Liaison Committee. The panel that will question Johnson has not been announced but is made up of the chairs of the Commons select committees - and some of them are prominent critics of the prime minister. Defence Committee chairman Tobias Ellwood and Health Committee chairman Jeremy Hunt have both  called on Johnson to step down. Meanwhile, Environmental Audit Committee chairman Philip Dunne is known to have voted against Mr Johnson and Foreign Affairs Committee chairman Tom Tugendhat is seen as a possible future leadership contender. The Newscast team got together last night to give their reaction to a day of drama as Boris Johnson battled his way through the confidence vote. There's analysis from BBC political editor Chris Mason and colleagues, reaction from key players and Theresa May in a sparkly ballgown.You can listen here. Sir Roger Gale has been an outspoken critic of Boris Johnson and, following the confidence vote, he's restating his view that the prime minister should not take the Conservatives into the next general election. But speaking to the BBC News Channel, Gale stressed ""we are not opponents of the government. We are Conservatives. We are working on a Conservative manifesto. And we are trying to deliver Conservative policies and Conservative legislation. ""It is Mr Johnson who is the problem. He doesn't seem to recognise that."" Asked whether MPs who voted against Johnson could realistically stand at the next general election with him as party leader, Gale suggests ""it is highly doubtful"" he would remain in the position beyond the autumn. He says ""none of the fundamental concerns about the prime minister"" have changed as a result of the confidence vote. As the government tries to stake out its agenda to move on from the confidence vote, Downing Street said the health secretary had updated the cabinet on the post-pandemic challenges facing the NHS. According to Downing Street's account, Sajid Javid told the meeting earlier today we had a ""Blockbuster healthcare system in the age of Netflix"" - a reference to the video rental chain that went bankrupt in 2010 as streaming services took over. Javid said the government had set the NHS a target of ""dramatically improving"" productivity and major changes were needed in areas such as the use of technology and data. It was no longer simply an option to stick to the status quo, the health secretary told colleagues. Â© 2025 BBC.

"This video can not be played Watch: Boris Johnson says the confidence vote result was ""convincing and decisive"" Prime Minister Boris Johnson has won the backing of a majority of Tory MPs in a confidence vote despite a significant revolt against his leadership. The PM won 59% of the vote, meaning he is now immune from a Conservative leadership challenge for a year. In all, 211 Tory MPs voted they had confidence in the PM's leadership while 148 voted against him. Mr Johnson described his confidence vote win as ""decisive"". Striking an upbeat tone, he said it was a ""very good"", ""convincing"" result and ""an opportunity to put behind us all the stuff that the media goes on about"". The result sees the prime minister remain in office, but critics said the scale of the rebellion against him showed his authority had been weakened, with some calling on him to resign. The vote share in support of Mr Johnson was lower than the 63% received by former Prime Minister Theresa May when she won a party confidence vote in 2018, before resigning six months later over a Brexit deadlock. Partygate: What did Sue Gray's report reveal? What happens next after confidence vote? Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said a ""divided"" Conservative Party was ""propping up"" Mr Johnson after he survived the confidence vote. And Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said while Mr Johnson had clung on to power, ""his reputation is in tatters and his authority is now totally shot"". But Downing Street said the result ""renews the PM's mandate"" and allows the government to ""focus relentlessly on the issues that concern our voters"". Tory MP and Welsh Secretary Simon Hart told the BBC the prime minister ""has lots to prove"" but insisted the result ""was pretty decisive"". This video can not be played Watch: The moment Sir Graham Brady announces Boris Johnson won the confidence vote Mr Johnson, who became prime minister in 2019, was informed he would face a vote on his leadership on Sunday during the Queen's Platinum Jubilee, after weeks of speculation over his future. The ballot was triggered by Conservative MPs after at least 15% of them wrote letters of no confidence to Sir Graham Brady, the chairman of the party's backbench 1922 Committee. Discontent among Tory MPs has grown since a highly critical report into lockdown parties in and near Downing Street during the Covid-19 pandemic was published last month. The report laid bare the extent of Covid rule-breaking in Number 10, including at a birthday party Mr Johnson was fined by the police for attending in June 2020. The fine meant Mr Johnson became the UK's first serving prime minister to be sanctioned for breaking the law. Some Tory MPs have also expressed dissent over tax rises, the government's response to rising living costs and its policy direction. The first rule of politics: learn how to count. Mathematically, Boris Johnson was the winner in Monday's confidence vote. The second rule of politics: numbers often only tell so much of the story. You can claim victory and be robbed of authority in the same moment. Boris Johnson can point to his own thumping majority from the last election. But the simple truth is when more than four in ten of your own MPs think the country would be better off without you, you have a problem. Read morefrom Chris here. The last Conservative prime minister to face a party vote on their leadership was Mrs May, who won the vote but resigned six months later over her approach to Brexit. Mr Johnson succeeded her in July 2019 and then called a general election in which the Conservatives won their biggest majority since former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's 1987 election victory. The next general election is expected to be held in 2024 but could be earlier if Mr Johnson uses his powers to call one. The next tests for Mr Johnson are by-elections held in Wakefield and in Tiverton & Honiton on the same day this month following the resignation of two Tory MPs. The Tory rebels who voted against Mr Johnson were insistent that the result had compromised the prime minister's ability to lead. One of them, Julian Sturdy, said the result was ""clear evidence that he no longer enjoys the full-hearted confidence of the parliamentary party and should consider his position"". Another one, Sir Roger Gale, said the result was very bad and he would be surprised if Mr Johnson was still in post by the autumn. But Mr Johnson's cabinet ministers rallied around him with messages of support. Health Secretary Sajid Javid said the prime minister had secured ""a fresh mandate"" from the Conservative Party following his confidence vote win. Mr Javid tweeted: ""Tonight the PM has secured a fresh mandate from the parliamentary party. Now we need to unite and focus on the country's challenges."" Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi, who said he would back Mr Johnson before the vote, said the PM won ""handsomely"". ""I hope we can draw a line under this issue,"" he said. Highlighting Mr Johnson's general election victory in 2019, Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries said it was ""time to get back to the job of governing"". This video can not be played Sir Keir Starmer says British public is ""fed up"" with the PM The Labour leader said the public were ""fed up with a prime minister who promises big but never delivers"". The PM was ""utterly unfit for the great office that he holds"", Sir Keir said, and Tory MPs have ""ignored the British public"". Shadow foreign secretary David Lammy said the result left the prime minister ""fatally wounded"". ""We need someone in office that the British people can trust,"" he told the BBC. ""That's why this vote was so important."" The leader of the Liberal Democrats urged Tory MPs to ""do the right thing, resign the whip and sit as an independent. ""For the sake of our country, this failing prime minister cannot be propped up any longer,"" Sir Ed said. The SNP's Westminster Leader Ian Blackford said he was ""stunned"" by the result, adding it was a ""big thing"" for that many Conservatives to vote against their own prime minister. He said the PM now has the support of less than a third of the House of Commons. ""For Boris, this should be over,"" he said.

"The world faces a ""human catastrophe"" from a food crisis arising from Russia's invasion of Ukraine, World Bank president David Malpass has said. He told the BBC that record rises in food prices would push hundreds of millions people into poverty and lower nutrition, if the crisis continues. The World Bank calculates there could be a ""huge"" 37% jump in food prices. This would hit the poor hardest, who will ""eat less and have less money for anything else such as schooling"". In an interview with BBC economics editor Faisal Islam, Mr Malpass, who leads the institution charged with global alleviation of poverty, said the impact on the poor made it ""an unfair kind of crisis... that was true also of Covid"". ""It's a human catastrophe, meaning nutrition goes down. But then it also becomes a political challenge for governments who can't do anything about it, they didn't cause it and they see the prices going up,"" he said on the sidelines of the IMF-World Bank meetings in Washington. Ukraine war causes 'giant leap' in food prices Ukraine war 'catastrophic for global food' The price rises are broad and deep, he said: ""It's affecting food of all different kinds oils, grains, and then it gets into other crops, corn crops, because they go up when wheat goes up"". There was enough food in the world to feed everybody, he said, and global stockpiles are large by historical standards, but there will have to be a sharing or sales process to get the food to where it is needed. Mr Malpass also discouraged countries from subsidising production or capping prices. Instead, he said, the focus needed to be on increasing supplies across the world of fertilisers and food, alongside targeted assistance for the very poorest people. The World Bank chief also warned of a knock on ""crisis within a crisis"" arising from the inability of developing countries to service their large pandemic debts, amid rising food and energy prices. ""This is a very real prospect. It's happening for some countries, we don't know how far it'll go. As many as 60% of the poorest countries right now are either in debt distress or at high risk of being in debt distress,"" he said. ""We have to be worried about a debt crisis, the best thing to do is to start early to act early on finding ways to reduce the debt burden for countries that are on have unsustainable debt, the longer you put it off, the worse it is,"" he added. The acknowledgement by the World Bank president that we have to be worried about a developing country debt crisis, is very significant. The combination of massive pandemic debts with rising interest rates, and rising prices is truly toxic. The talk on the sidelines here at the IMF and World Bank meetings is that the rich countries told emerging economies not to worry about borrowing in order to spend to help suppress the pandemic. Now those countries are wondering if these record debts will be written off. Campaigning groups are preparing mobilisations over a pandemic debt jubilee. But there is silence from the rich country lenders, so far. And there is a very new dynamic these days. The bankers to whom these sums are owed are no longer just in the West. China is now, very broadly, owed as much as the entire collection of Western creditors known as the Paris Club. How will it respond to calls for leniency on the repayment of loans? Mr Malpass says of China: ""They have different rules, for example, contracts that have non-disclosure clauses, meaning you can't share the terms with other people that makes it very hard to restructure those debts"". China has also secured its lending against ports and natural resources. Sri Lanka is a case in point right now. The unwinding of all of this might not be orderly, and could have significant geopolitical consequences. Earlier this month, the United Nations said that the Ukraine war had led to a ""giant leap"" in food prices, as they hit a new record high in March. It came as the war cut off supplies from the world's biggest exporter of sunflower oil and the cost of alternatives climbed. Ukraine is also a major producer of cereals such as maize and wheat which have risen sharply in price too. The UN said ""war in the Black Sea region spread shocks through markets for staple grains and vegetable oils"". The UN Food Prices Index tracks the world's most-traded food commodities - measuring the average prices of cereal, vegetable oil, dairy, meat, and sugar. Food prices are at their highest since records began 60 years ago, according to the index, after they jumped nearly 13% in March, following February's record high. Food commodity prices were already at 10-year highs before the war in Ukraine, according to the index, because of global harvest issues.

"Patients with long Covid are facing a postcode lottery across the UK when it comes to getting care, nurses say. The Royal College of Nursing (RCN) said treatment varied hugely with some services treating it as a physical condition, but others as psychological. The union also highlighted long waits in parts of England, which has a network of specialist clinics. It warned that patients in Scotland and Wales may be missing out because of a lack of dedicated clinics. But officials there say patients are getting support via core NHS services. What are the symptoms of long Covid? Access to long Covid services and support is for patients with persistent symptoms following an infection. These are defined as ones that continue for more than 12 weeks, and which cannot be explained by an alternative diagnosis. More than 200 symptoms have been linked to long Covid but some of the main symptoms are extreme fatigue, breathlessness, brain fog, heart problems and severe headaches. Speaking at the RCN's conference in Glasgow, nurses said they had seen first-hand how debilitating the symptoms could be. Nearly half of patients referred to specialist services are aged 35 to 54. Jo Strucke, a mental health nurse who works in a specialist service in Yorkshire, said: ""Some of our patients have really complex physical health problems and their lives have been transformed. ""They may be unable to work, socialise and do things they previously enjoyed."" Helen Donovan, the RCN's public health lead, added: ""As nursing staff we see first-hand how life-limiting long Covid can be."" But she said: ""There aren't enough specialist services to meet growing demand and the help patients get varies hugely across the country."" Figures in England show of the 4,400 people who got their initial assessment at one of the country's 90 dedicated adult clinics in the most recent month, 30% had been waiting more than 15 weeks for an initial assessment. The union also highlighted the wide variation in waits, with nearly half of patients waiting more than 15 weeks in the south-east and south-west, compared with 20% in the north-west. NHS England said local services were working hard to reduce waiting times. Similar data is not available for Northern Ireland, which also has dedicated services. In Wales and Scotland it is left to core NHS services to see patients, but extra investment has been made to support patients. The Welsh government said its support package still represented an ""individual and tailored"" programme, which included both support in the community close to home - such as rehab aimed at improving breathing - through to hospital care for the most complex cases. A Scottish government spokeswoman said it was drawing on the full range of services, from GPs and community-based rehab teams, to hospitals for tests and more complex support for patients.

"Patients in England can get early access to more cutting-edge medicines through a new fund. The Innovative Medicines Fund (IMF) works like the existing Cancer Drugs Fund (CDF), fast-tracking promising treatments, even if they are expensive and have not yet been approved for routine NHS use. It will cover potentially life-saving drugs for rare and genetic diseases. The government has allocated up to Â£680m a year to be shared by the funds. The IMF, like the CDF, will mean a newly approved medicine could be prescribed immediately, before final recommendations on it are drawn up by the advisory body that weighs the cost versus benefit of drugs used by the NHS - an organisation called NICE (the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence). Patients would be able to access the treatment while data is collected for NICE to determine whether the medicine is affordable and effective enough to offer more widely. A similar fund for innovative treatments - theNew Medicines Fund,external- already exists in Scotland. Wales has aNew Treatments Fund,externalthat helps pay for high-cost drugs which have been recommended as cost-effective by NICE. Experts hope funds like these will improve the lives of many who might otherwise miss out. For example, approving treatments for rare conditions can be challenging, as the number of patients affected by a single rare disease is small. The IMF offers a potential solution to this problem, giving patients the opportunity to have promising treatments fast-tracked, and, in turn, increasing the amount of data available to NICE for future decisions.

"This video can not be played Watch: Boris Johnson says the confidence vote result was ""convincing and decisive"" Prime Minister Boris Johnson has won the backing of a majority of Tory MPs in a confidence vote despite a significant revolt against his leadership. The PM won 59% of the vote, meaning he is now immune from a Conservative leadership challenge for a year. In all, 211 Tory MPs voted they had confidence in the PM's leadership while 148 voted against him. Mr Johnson described his confidence vote win as ""decisive"". Striking an upbeat tone, he said it was a ""very good"", ""convincing"" result and ""an opportunity to put behind us all the stuff that the media goes on about"". The result sees the prime minister remain in office, but critics said the scale of the rebellion against him showed his authority had been weakened, with some calling on him to resign. The vote share in support of Mr Johnson was lower than the 63% received by former Prime Minister Theresa May when she won a party confidence vote in 2018, before resigning six months later over a Brexit deadlock. Partygate: What did Sue Gray's report reveal? What happens next after confidence vote? Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said a ""divided"" Conservative Party was ""propping up"" Mr Johnson after he survived the confidence vote. And Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said while Mr Johnson had clung on to power, ""his reputation is in tatters and his authority is now totally shot"". But Downing Street said the result ""renews the PM's mandate"" and allows the government to ""focus relentlessly on the issues that concern our voters"". Tory MP and Welsh Secretary Simon Hart told the BBC the prime minister ""has lots to prove"" but insisted the result ""was pretty decisive"". This video can not be played Watch: The moment Sir Graham Brady announces Boris Johnson won the confidence vote Mr Johnson, who became prime minister in 2019, was informed he would face a vote on his leadership on Sunday during the Queen's Platinum Jubilee, after weeks of speculation over his future. The ballot was triggered by Conservative MPs after at least 15% of them wrote letters of no confidence to Sir Graham Brady, the chairman of the party's backbench 1922 Committee. Discontent among Tory MPs has grown since a highly critical report into lockdown parties in and near Downing Street during the Covid-19 pandemic was published last month. The report laid bare the extent of Covid rule-breaking in Number 10, including at a birthday party Mr Johnson was fined by the police for attending in June 2020. The fine meant Mr Johnson became the UK's first serving prime minister to be sanctioned for breaking the law. Some Tory MPs have also expressed dissent over tax rises, the government's response to rising living costs and its policy direction. The first rule of politics: learn how to count. Mathematically, Boris Johnson was the winner in Monday's confidence vote. The second rule of politics: numbers often only tell so much of the story. You can claim victory and be robbed of authority in the same moment. Boris Johnson can point to his own thumping majority from the last election. But the simple truth is when more than four in ten of your own MPs think the country would be better off without you, you have a problem. Read morefrom Chris here. The last Conservative prime minister to face a party vote on their leadership was Mrs May, who won the vote but resigned six months later over her approach to Brexit. Mr Johnson succeeded her in July 2019 and then called a general election in which the Conservatives won their biggest majority since former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's 1987 election victory. The next general election is expected to be held in 2024 but could be earlier if Mr Johnson uses his powers to call one. The next tests for Mr Johnson are by-elections held in Wakefield and in Tiverton & Honiton on the same day this month following the resignation of two Tory MPs. The Tory rebels who voted against Mr Johnson were insistent that the result had compromised the prime minister's ability to lead. One of them, Julian Sturdy, said the result was ""clear evidence that he no longer enjoys the full-hearted confidence of the parliamentary party and should consider his position"". Another one, Sir Roger Gale, said the result was very bad and he would be surprised if Mr Johnson was still in post by the autumn. But Mr Johnson's cabinet ministers rallied around him with messages of support. Health Secretary Sajid Javid said the prime minister had secured ""a fresh mandate"" from the Conservative Party following his confidence vote win. Mr Javid tweeted: ""Tonight the PM has secured a fresh mandate from the parliamentary party. Now we need to unite and focus on the country's challenges."" Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi, who said he would back Mr Johnson before the vote, said the PM won ""handsomely"". ""I hope we can draw a line under this issue,"" he said. Highlighting Mr Johnson's general election victory in 2019, Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries said it was ""time to get back to the job of governing"". This video can not be played Sir Keir Starmer says British public is ""fed up"" with the PM The Labour leader said the public were ""fed up with a prime minister who promises big but never delivers"". The PM was ""utterly unfit for the great office that he holds"", Sir Keir said, and Tory MPs have ""ignored the British public"". Shadow foreign secretary David Lammy said the result left the prime minister ""fatally wounded"". ""We need someone in office that the British people can trust,"" he told the BBC. ""That's why this vote was so important."" The leader of the Liberal Democrats urged Tory MPs to ""do the right thing, resign the whip and sit as an independent. ""For the sake of our country, this failing prime minister cannot be propped up any longer,"" Sir Ed said. The SNP's Westminster Leader Ian Blackford said he was ""stunned"" by the result, adding it was a ""big thing"" for that many Conservatives to vote against their own prime minister. He said the PM now has the support of less than a third of the House of Commons. ""For Boris, this should be over,"" he said.

"This video can not be played Watch: Time to draw a line and take country forward - PM to Cabinet Boris Johnson has promised to cut taxes and government waste after surviving an attempt by his own MPs to oust him. The prime minister thanked ministers for their support in a confidence vote, which saw 41% of Tory MPs saying they had lost faith in him. He urged them to ""draw a line"" under questions about his leadership and vowed a return to ""fundamental"" Tory economic policies. The number of rebels in Monday night's vote was higher than predicted. And some Conservative MPs are still publicly calling on him to quit over widespread Covid rule-breaking in Downing Street. Tobias Ellwood, a longstanding critic of the PM, said the ""honourable way forward"" would be for him to ""step back"" and accept that the task of uniting the Conservative Party to win the next general election is ""too big"". But he added: ""We have to deal with the reality that those days of an honourable resignation are not there."" Ukraine's president: I'm happy Johnson is still PM Tory MP says he backed PM after funding assurances Could Boris Johnson be challenged again? Senior government figures have come out to defend Mr Johnson, including Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab who said there was ""no credible alternative"" to the prime minister. And backbencher Philip Davies - who voted against Mr Johnson on Monday - said: ""The prime minister won fair and square. My view is that you've got to accept the result. If you lose a vote, you accept it. That's the whole point of democracy."" The PM has also received support from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, whotold a Financial Times event,externalhe was ""very happy"" the UK leader had remained in post. The prime minister may want to draw a line under questions over his leadership - but many of his MPs are not willing to do so. Senior MPs have told the BBC that there would be significant pressure on the 1922 committee to change the current rules - which protect the prime minister from another confidence vote for 12 months. Rebels believe if the Conservatives lose the two by-elections being held later this month, in Wakefield, West Yorkshire, and Tiverton Honiton, in Devon - that will prompt a new leadership crisis. They also believe the scandal over lockdown parties in Downing Street is far from over, with the Commons privileges committee still to look into whether the PM misled Parliament when he denied parties had been held in downing street and insisted all rules had been followed. That could unearth new evidence - and the conclusions could be highly damaging. Last night's confidence vote result does not resolve the debate on Boris Johnson's future. As one senior backbencher put it, it means the prime minster thinks he can stay on - but the rebels think they are within touching distance of bringing him down. Read Nick's full analysis In the confidence vote, triggered by Partygate, Mr Johnson was backed by 211 Conservative MPs, but 148 voted to remove him. Mr Johnson hailed this as a ""decisive"" victory - and on Tuesday morning told a cabinet meeting his ""fundamental Conservative instinct"" was to allow people to decide how to spend their money. He urged cabinet ministers to find ways to make savings and told them ""delivering tax cuts"" would help deliver ""considerable growth in employment and economic progress"". But Labour's shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said Mr Johnson did not have ""any sense of honour"" and should resign. Speaking to BBC News, she said Tory MPs who voted to keep the PM in office were ""just not listening to the scale of frustration and anger across the country"". ""There's really got to be some consequences when someone just isn't telling the truth, isn't fit for office, isn't taking the action the country needs"". Mr Johnson won the confidence of 59% of his MPs, however, his critics have noted that his predecessor Theresa May secured the support of 63% when she faced her own confidence vote but was still forced out of office six months later. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey described Mr Johnson as a ""lying lawbreaker"" who was ""clinging on by the skin of his teeth"" while SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford likened him to a ""dead man walking"". ""Whether it's by Tory MPs finally acting in a responsible manner or indeed the Privileges Committee taking action against him, he will be gone,"" Mr Blackford said.

"Heavy fighting continues in the eastern Ukrainian city of Severodonetsk, which Russian forces have been trying for weeks to capture It comes as the battle for Donbas grinds on with neither side making major gains A military analyst says the fighting in Ukraine has settled into a rhythm reminiscent of trench warfare in World War One Justin Crump says Russia appears to have slight momentum but are âlucky to capture a field in 24 hoursâ ""Stalemate is not an option"" for Ukraine, the country's president has said, as he again floated the idea of Nato membership Volodymyr Zelensky said the country had lost too many people to ""simply cede our territory"" Meanwhile, the bodies of some Ukrainian fighters killed at the Azovstal steelworks have been handed over to Kyiv, families of Ukraine's Azov unit say Edited by Chris Giles Todayâs live page was edited by Jeremy Gahagan, Alex Therrien, Marie Jackson and Chris Giles. The writers were James Fitzgerald, Sam Hancock, Alexandra FouchÃ©, Emily McGarvey and Hamzah Abbas. Join us tomorrow.   We're pausing our live coverage soon, but here's a look at the main developments in Ukraine today: There is no justification for Russia's brutal disregard of international law in Ukraine, the former German-Chancellor Angela Merkel has said in her first interview since leaving office last year. Merkel said that ""if we start going through the centuries and say which piece of territory belongs to whom, then we'll only have war - that's not possible at all"". Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky previously criticised Merkel and former French President Nicolas Sarkozy for their move to block Ukraine's admission to Nato in 2008, suggesting that it had been a clear ""miscalculation"" that emboldened Russia. Asked about rejecting Ukraine's Nato membership back then, Merkel said that if she hadn't have vetoed the move, ""Putin would do something that would not be good for Ukraine"". The World Bank has downgraded its estimate for global economic growth to 2.9% because of the conflict in Ukraine, which along with other factors, has caused a severe downturn. ""Global growth is expected to slump from 5.7% in 2021 to 2.9% in 2022 - significantly lower than 4.1% that was anticipated in January,""it said in its Global Economic Prospects report,external. ""The world economy is expected to experience its sharpest deceleration following an initial recovery from global recession in more than 80 years,"" it added. Global economic growth had recovered to 5.7% last year following the downturn caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. ""The war in Ukraine, lockdowns in China, supply-chain disruptions, and the risk of stagflation are hammering growth. For many countries, recession will be hard to avoid,"" said the bank's president, David Malpass.  The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, after attacks in March The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency - the UN's nuclear watchdog - has dismissed as absurd allegations by Ukraine's nuclear operator that he had lied about being invited to visit a Russian-occupied nuclear power plant there. Rafael Grossi has been trying to visit the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant - Europe's largest - which Russian forces took control of in early March. But Ukraine's nuclear operator has said a visit by the watchdog would legitimise Russia's occupation of the plant. Speaking to the BBC's Newshour, Grossi said there was a contractual obligation to allow safety inspections by his organisation. ""The government have requested us to do this. There have been statements, I believe even today, implying that... I am lying when I say this."" He added that it was not ""an invitation that can or can't be extended"", but ""an obligation"" as there is a lot of nuclear material at the plant which has not been inspected, leading to an ""abnormal"" and ""unsustainable"" situation. There is no suggestion that the Ukrainian government has accused Grossi of lying, though the country's nuclear operator, Energoatom, says that Ukraine has not invited him to visit. As we've been reporting, heavy fighting is continuing in the eastern Ukrainian city of Severodonetsk, which Russian forces have been trying to capture for weeks. Now, officials say Ukrainian forces are finding it hard to
stave off Russian attacks in the centre of Severodonetsk but
Russia has still not taken control of the city, according to Luhansk regional governor Serhiy Haidai. Earlier, the city's mayor, Oleksandr Stryuk warned thatRussia was aiming to capture the city with more troops, and said that Severdonetsk's armed forces have ""strengthened their positions and are holding the line"". Russian troops
were constantly shelling its twin city Lysychansk, and Moscow's forces were deliberately targeting areas where civilians were hiding, Haidai said on the Telegram messaging app. He reiterated a call for long-range artillery to be sent to Ukraine to enable its troops to repel the Russians in the region. Anna Melnichuk, the deputy leader of Konstantinovka city council, has been outlining the problems faced in her city and neighbouring areas. She told the BBC that while the city, north of Donetsk, is being protected by the Ukrainian army, conditions are difficult. ""We have some problems with gas, and water as well."" She added that the government and local council were in touch with organisations which were providing food, but deliveries by car were difficult due to problems with petrol. When asked about the conditions in Severodonetsk, where fighting continues, Melnichuk said: ""Yes, the situation is truly difficult, but not just because of war actions, but because of problems with water, with food, with electricity."" About 300 Ukrainian civilians, mostly journalists and public activists, are being kept in improvised prisons in Kherson, and 300 more in other occupied settlements in the Kherson region, according to the Ukrainian president's envoy for Crimea, Tamila Tasheva. Tasheva said there are about 600 people in the region who are ""actually hostages and are being held in specially equipped basements, actually jails,"" Interfax news agency reported. ""They are kept in inhumane conditions and tortured. Witnesses report cries that could be heard from the places were our citizens are subjected to such illegal actions,"" she told a news briefing. She said some civilians are being moved from the Kherson region to Crimea and being kept as ""civilian hostages and prisoners of war"". ""Some people who left Mariupol were detained during filtration on the administrative border with Crimea and were taken to the Simferopol remand centre,"" she said. If you are just joining us, or looking for a recap, here's a round-up of the latest events in Ukraine:  British troops in World War One going up the line to their trenches The conflict in parts of Ukraine has been described asreminiscent of the trench warfare used in World War I- but what is meant by the term? Trenches are ditches dug into the ground that offer shelter and protection against enemy fire and means both sides sacrifice mobility in order to gain protection. During World War I, trenches were developed from simple ditches into more complex systems, with a front line, known as the fire trench, the second line, known as the support trench, and a third line, known as the reserve trench. These trenches were connected by communication trenches, which allowed men to run between lines, without ever having to go over open ground. The BBC has previously been granted access to trenches being used by the Ukrainian army. The soldiers working and living in them told the BBC that they are sleeping and eating in them, while building new ones every day. This video can not be played Ukraine war: Inside Kyiv's trench defences Joe InwoodReporting from Kyiv There had been much speculation about what had happened to Aiden Aslin and Shaun Pinner,two British men captured fighting in the Ukrainian port city of Mariupol. Footage of Aslin shortly after his capture - his face bloodied and bruised, being interviewed by a Russian propaganda channel - led many to fear for his wellbeing. Now we know both men are alive and are being held in the occupied Donestsk Peopleâs Republic, after a video appeared of them standing in what appears to be a court. Standing alongside a third man, Moroccan national Saaudun Brahim, the pair spoke only to confirm they knew the charges against them and were happy for their case to proceed without the evidence of witnesses. Both were able to stand unaided and seemed aware of their surroundings. According to the Interfax news agency, the leader of the self-proclaimed DNR, Denis Pushilin, has said they will be charged in the âSupreme Courtâ of the region, which is not recognised internationally. The British pair are facing several âchargesâ, including violent seizure of power, acting as mercenaries and undergoing training to carry out terrorist activities. It is feared the court, which is not internationally recognised, could give them the death penalty if it finds them guilty. Russia's parliament has passed two bills ending theEuropean Court of Human Rightsâ jurisdictionin Russia, after it announced it would exit the court in March amid the conflict in Ukraine. The ECHR aims to apply and protect the civil and political rights of the continent's citizens, and this previously provided a way to pursue legal and human rights cases against Russia that had either been rejected or ignored by Russian courts. One of the bills removes Russia from the court's jurisdiction and the second bill sets 15 March as the cut-off point, meaning rulings against Russia made after that date are not to be implemented, the RIA Novosti news agency reports. The Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe expelled Russia from the organisation on 15 March, which the ECHR is part of, in response to Russiaâs invasion of Ukraine. Russia has said that it independently decided to leave the Council of Europe, with former President Dmitry Medvedev saying that Russiaâs exit from the organisation represented an opportunity to restore the death penalty, which the Council of Europeanâs rules prohibit. A Russian journalist who was fined and released after she protested against the war in Ukraine on a live TV news programme earlier this year says she feels Ukrainian and will change her surname as a sign of support. Marina Ovsyannikova - who says her father is Ukrainian - announced the movein a post on Facebook,external. ""I'm not a 'good Russian', I'm Ukrainian. As a sign of support of Ukraine, I intend to change the surname of Ovsyannikov to the native Tkachuk."" Formerly an editor at Russian state-controlled Channel One,she was shortly detained in Marchin Russia after she ran on to the set of the channel holding a sign saying ""no war"". She has since emigrated to Germany. James WaterhouseReporting from Kyiv âVery happyâ were two of the words President Volodymyr Zelensky used in reaction to UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson surviving his vote of confidence, describing him as a âtrue friend of Ukraineâ. Itâs a sentiment echoed by many on the cobbled streets of central Kyiv, mainly because the UK government is one of the biggest supporters of the country in this war, outside the European Union and United States. Of course, peopleâs views of the British prime minister arenât shaped by domestic issues. Even before this invasion, though, Ukrainians cared deeply about the level of military aid being supplied by western allies as Russia continued to gather troops on the border. They are continuing to defend, but Russia has already taken a fifth of Ukrainian territory. As we reported earlier, military analyst Justin Crump has said conflict in parts of Ukraine is nowreminiscent of the trench warfare seen in World War One. Here's a selection of images capturing life for Ukrainian troops in trench positions on the frontline: Soldiers walk in trenches to take cover for Russian artillery strikes at an undisclosed defence position on the outskirts of the separatist region of Donetsk Ukrainian troops walk along a trench at a position on the frontline near Bakhmut in Ukraine's Donbas region Ukraine's army appears to have an advantage in any given battle at the moment because they are generally defending rather than attacking, according to military analyst Justin Crump A Ukrainian servicewoman looks out of a trench at a position near a frontline in the Donetsk region Parts of Ukraine have been taken back to the trench-filled warfare of decades ago Earlier, we reported on the fighting in Severodonetsk and Lysychansk. President Zelensky called them ""dead cities"" and now Severodonetsk's Mayor, Oleksandr Stryuk, has been speaking to Ukrainian TV about the current situation.He warned that Russia is aiming to capture the city with more troops, and said that Severdonetsk's armed forces have ""strengthened their positions and are holding the line"". An update from the Ukrainian armed forces earlier today also suggested that there were further Russian troops in the area. It has not yet been possible for the BBC to verify exact details of the fighting. Danny AeberhardEurope Regional Editor, BBC World Service As we've been reporting, Ukraine's national nuclear operator has accused the head of the UN nuclear watchdog, IAEA, of lying about being invited by Ukraine to visit the Russian-occupied nuclear plant at Zaporizhzhia. The IAEA's director general, Rafael Grossi, insisted on Monday that such a visit would take place, ideally sooner rather than later, citing fears over nuclear security at the plant Ukraine's nuclear operator, Energoatom, did not mince its words. In a statement, it said it saw efforts by Grossi to visit the Zaporizhzhia plant as an attempt to legitimise Russia's occupation of the facility. It said Ukraine had not invited him to visit, and had refused permission previously. Energoatom also blamed Russia for blocking the transfer of crucial data from the plant to the IAEA. Grossi - in an impassioned address on Monday - stressed a visit was vital, saying the Zaporizhzhia plant was disconnected from safety systems. Russian forcestook over the plant- Europe's largest - at the start of the conflict. Russian forces now control almost all of Ukraine's easternmost region, the Russian defence minister says. 97% of Luhansk Oblast has been ""liberated"", Sergei Shoigu told a meeting of the defence ministry, broadcast on state TV. Shoigu claims that residential areas of the flashpoint city of Severodonetsk are in Moscow's hands, and further attempts are being made to gain industrial areas. It was not possible for the BBC to independently verify the claims. There have been conflicting accounts of which army controls which territory as battles for the city continue. James FitzGeraldBBC News Russia could look to make 'micro-scale' gains in Kharkiv, says an expert Fighting
in Ukraine has settled into a rhythm reminiscent of trench warfare in World War One, says a military analyst. Justin
Crump, chief executive of security consultancy Sibylline, tells the BBC the
conflict has become âmicro-levelâ - with Russia now âlucky to capture a field
in 24 hoursâ. This is because the defending army appears to have an advantage
in any given battle at the moment. In some
places, that favours Ukrainians holding onto their territory; in others, it
suits Russian troops occupying cities theyâve captured. Crump, a
former British Army serviceman, says Russia appears to have slight momentum â
as its troops âgrind forwardâ. Moscow will want to capture Severodonetsk and
then the remainder of the eastern Donbas region in order to declare âany sort
of victoryâ. He expects
the Kremlin to set its sights Zaporizhzhia next, then make a fresh attempt at Kharkiv and look to capture Odesa on the south coast. Russiaâs
brand of attritional warfare has been seen to work, Crump says â but ânothing
is inevitableâ about what happens next. âRussiaâs
got to be able to keep paying the bill,â he says â referring to the
expense of the war, as well as the human toll. As a
result of poor tactics and other shortcomings, Russia has also shown that it
can only attack successfully on a single axis at a time, Crump claims. From the
Ukrainian perspective, high-spec weapons donations from Western nations â such as
missile-launchers recently promised by the US and UK â are no âsilver bulletâ,
says Crump, because the conflict has become less precise than that. He says
there is also the question of how long Western countries keep up their support
for Ukraine. But
Russia âcanât leave the frontline where it isâ, he adds â suggesting that
Ukraine will refuse to give up the territories currently in the hands of its
enemy. There is,
therefore, the possibility of a âfrozen conflict at bestâ. The Azovstal steelwork was for weeks under relentless Russian shelling We reported earlierthat the bodies of some Ukrainian fighters killed defending the key southern port of Mariupol from Russian forces at the Azovstal steel plant have been handed over to Kyiv. The fighters' families have said this was part of a prisoner exchange with Russia, with each side receiving 160 bodies. Of those on the Ukrainian side, more than 50 bodies were members of the Azov regiment, the families said on the Telegram messenging service. The identification process is continuing. The families added that talks are ongoing on further prisoner swaps, without giving any further details. More than 2,500 Azovstal defenders - which also include border guards, police and territorial defence - are currently being held by Russia, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said earlier. Kyiv is seeking the handover of them all, but several leading Russian lawmakers are demanding that some of the soldiers - specifically from the Azov regiment - should be put on trial. The regiment was set up in 2014, with some of its members initially linked to far-right groups. Russia describes Azov regiment fighters as neo-Nazis - a claim denied by Ukraine, who says the unit has been reformed and is outside politics. Â© 2025 BBC.
