"Energy regulator Ofgem is introducing new rules from 15 December to help vulnerable customers who struggle to pay their energy bills this winter. Suppliers will be required to offer emergency credit to customers who cannot top up prepayment meters. And if customers are in debt, suppliers must put them on ""realistic and sustainable"" repayment plans. In March, suppliers voluntarily agreed with the government to support people affected by the pandemic. Now Ofgem has updated its licence rules to formally require suppliers to help customers in financial difficulty. The industry watchdog said those in financial distress would get some breathing space, but ultimately all customers will need to pay for the energy they use. This followsOfgem cutting the price capon default tariffs and prepayment meters, due to falling gas wholesale prices, which means cheaper energy bills for millions of people this winter. ""Suppliers have stepped up to the challenge of supporting their customers during the Covid-19 crisis, especially those in vulnerable situations,"" said Ofgem's director of retail Philippa Pickford. ""Customers who are struggling to pay their bills should contact their supplier as soon as possible. The extra protections we have announced today will help ensure they get some breathing space this winter."" Energy bills: Millions set to see 'big savings' as price cap lowered British Gas sorry for winter prepayment top-up switch failure Coronavirus: Energy firms permitted to chase unpaid bills again From 15 December, suppliers will be required to offer emergency credit or extra prepayment credit to households in vulnerable circumstances. This could be because people are temporarily unable to afford to top up their prepayment meters, or are unable to visit their local shop due to having to self-isolate or having a mobility issue. Energy suppliers need to offer emergency credit to people on prepayment meters who are temporarily unable to top them up Ofgem wants to reduce the number of prepayment customers who run out of credit and end up being without energy. The regulator also wants to make sure that suppliers have appropriate credit management policies, make proactive contact with customers, and set repayment rates based on their ability to pay. In September, Citizens Advice estimated that6 million people in the UK have fallen behind on paying at least one household bill,externalduring the pandemic, and that many more are on the cusp of being unable to afford to make ends meet. ""This raft of new protections from Ofgem should help more people who are struggling to stay afloat,"" said Citizen Advice's chief executive Dame Gillian Guy. ""Energy is an essential service and everyone should be confident they can adequately heat their home and protect their health - especially during a global pandemic. ""We've been pressing for the measures agreed between government and energy suppliers to help people through the coronavirus pandemic to be extended and widened, so we're very pleased to see this announcement from the regulator."" However, she warned that many consumers will still struggle to ""pay for the basics"", even with help from energy suppliers. Dame Gillian added: ""Government needs to do more to support those who need it most, including making the temporary uplift to Universal Credit and Working Tax Credit permanent.""

"This video can not be played Living with the 'invisible pain' of endometriosis Endometriosis care across the UK needs urgent improvement and diagnosis times need to be cut in half, a report by MPs says. It found an average wait for a diagnosis was eight years and that has not improved in more than a decade. Endometriosis affects one in 10 women in the UK and can cause debilitating pain, heavy periods and infertility. Nadine Dorries, minister for women's health said awareness was increasing but there was still a long way to go. More than 10,000 people took part in the All-Party Political Group inquiry which found that 58% of people visited the GP more than 10 times before diagnosis and 53% went to A&E with symptoms before diagnosis. The majority of people also told MPs their mental health, education and careers had been damaged by the condition. About 90% said they would have liked access to psychological support but were never offered it, with 35% having a reduced income due to endometriosis. There is no cure for the condition and treatment can include hormone therapy and surgery. Sarah Smallbone had four operations in three years to alleviate symptoms Sarah Smallbone, 37, from Essex, who gave evidence to the inquiry, was diagnosed with endometriosis aged 30 and had four operations in three years. She worked at a supermarket, but quit as her condition got worse. ""Endometriosis is life-changing. The pain can be so varied but at its worst, it is crippling to the point that the strongest painkillers only seem to make me drowsy,"" she said. ""After several warnings for my sickness, the final straw was returning from surgery, which ended up causing me kidney failure, and being given an official disciplinary. Knowing that I still needed another operation to reverse my bowel, I felt I had no choice but to quit."" Helen-Marie Brewster said the condition led to her getting poor GCSEs Helen-Marie Brewster, 28, from Hull, has been told by doctors that her only remaining treatment option is a full hysterectomy. She had symptoms throughout secondary school but was only diagnosed when she left education. ""I failed most of my GCSEs because I was in bed, in crippling pain. I've lost nearly every job I've ever had because of my poor attendance,"" she said. ""GPs ask me to explain to them what endometriosis is, because they don't know. They're the ones who are meant to help. ""Last year I visited the A&E department 17 times trying to find help and pain relief for this condition, even for just a few days so I can keep going. ""The wait time for diagnosis is so long that in that time it's spreading and doing more damage the longer it is left untreated... We can't carry on like this."" Natalie Meagan-Blake had to change her doctor four times before she was listened to Natalie Meagan-Blake, 37, who was diagnosed four years ago, said there were further barriers for those from black, Asian and minority ethnic communities. She says she had to change her doctor four times before she was listened to and referred to a gynaecologist. Then for her surgery she was missed off the operation list twice. ""The majority of black women and transgender men I've spoken to have had poor treatment, but you speak to other women and they're like, 'Yes, I have an appointment'."" The report calls for the government to investigate these health disparities and end the ethnicity and gender gaps in medical research. It also recommends all UK nations have compulsory menstrual wellbeing on the school curriculum so young people know the warning signs and know when to seek help. It is compulsory in schools in England from 2020, but is not currently UK-wide. The report also calls for training to be reviewed for GPs, nurses and gynaecologists and for investment in research to find a cure. It is where tissue similar to the lining of the womb grows elsewhere in the body - often around the reproductive organs, bowel and bladder Like the womb lining, the tissue builds up and bleeds every month but, with no way to escape the body, the blood is trapped, leading to inflammation, pain and formation of scar tissue For some women there are no symptoms, but for others it is debilitating and can causechronic pelvic pain, painful sex, painful bowel and bladder movements, fatigue and difficulties getting pregnant,external Conservative MP Sir David Amess, who chaired the inquiry, said: ""It is not acceptable that endometriosis and its potentially debilitating and damaging symptoms are often ignored or not taken seriously - or downplayed as linked to the menstrual cycle and periods."" Edward Morris, president of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) said: ""The long diagnosis times and poor patient experience could be attributed to the significant gap in data when it comes to women and girls. ""The RCOG would like to see medical research in this area prioritised."" Nadine Dorries, minister for women's health, said it should not be the case that women have to wait so long to be diagnosed. ""While awareness of this, and other painful and potentially debilitating gynaecological conditions are increasing, there is still a long way to go,"" she said. ""I am committed to filling the evidence gaps to better understand the issues facing women and improve women's health. We have provided Â£2m, through the National Institute for Health Research, to investigate the effectiveness of surgery compared with non-surgical interventions to manage chronic pain in a specific type of endometriosis. ""Clinicians have a vital role in removing the stigma associated with endometriosis and I would urge them to follow the NICE guidelines, and to do all they can to support the mental and physical health of those suffering from this condition.""

"Guidance for people in England identified as being ""clinically extremely vulnerable"" is being updated from 19 July - but what is actually changing? Formal advice telling them to take extra care, or ""shield"", to avoid becoming seriously ill from Covid was paused at the start of April. Most coronavirus restrictionsare being lifted in Englandon 19 July. The government says people considered to be clinically extremely should, as a minimum, follow the same guidance as everyone else. However, if you are at higher risk of becoming ill, it says you may wish to ""think particularly carefully"" about taking extra precautions when meeting others you do not usually meet, including: limiting moments of close contact considering whether you and others have been fully vaccinated (you might want to wait until 14 days after your second dose before meeting) considering the risk if Covid levels are high in the general community meeting outside if possible ensuring inside spaces are well-ventilated washing hands regularly and avoiding face-touching continuing social distancing if that feels right for you asking friends/family to take lateral flow tests before meeting There is similar but separate official advice for people who have been shielding inScotland,external,Wales,externalandNorthern Ireland,external. Although Scotland moves toCovid protection level zero,externalon 19 July, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon saidkeeping the mandatory use of face coveringspast then would give ""added protection and assurance"" to people who were particularly vulnerable. From 19 July in England, general advice to work from home where possible will end - as will the need for social distancing measures in the workplace. However, companies still havelegally binding health and safety responsibilities,external- and your employer should explain the measures in place to keep you safe at work. Some firms, for example, may ask employees to take regular Covid tests to identify asymptomatic people. TheCoronavirus Job Retention Scheme (furlough),externalis available until 30 September. You may be eligible to benefit, provided your employer agrees. You may also qualify for Statutory Sick Pay (SSP) or Employment and Support Allowance (ESA) if you are sick or incapable of work, either due to coronavirus or other health reasons. Read theupdated government advice,external. Although the legal requirement to wear a face covering is being lifted from 19 July, the government says it ""expects and recommends"" that people wear them in crowded areas - such as busy shops and public transport. You should consider travelling outside peak hours, and shopping at quieter times of day, to reduce the number of people you come into contact with. You may be more comfortable booking supermarket deliveries online. TheNHS Volunteer Responders,externalprogramme is still available to offer support. Data showsCovid vaccines are highly effectivein most people in clinical risk groups. Two doses are needed for best protection. Being double-jabbed reduces the risk of symptomatic Covid-19 by around 90%, say experts. But no vaccine is 100% effective. Some people with weak immune systems may not get as much benefit from the vaccine, for example. You should already have been offered a vaccine but, if not,book through the NHS website,externalor call 119. The most vulnerable peopleare likely to be offered booster jabs from September,external, to provide extra protection against virus variants through the winter months. You are encouraged to go outside for exercise and attend NHS appointments for your existing health conditions. The pandemic may have triggered feelings of worry, distress or loneliness - a normal response to an unprecedented period of disruption. The governmentrecommends several support websites,external. If you are thought to be at very high risk of serious illness from coronavirus you will have been put on theNHS Shielded Patient List,external. A combination of factors can contribute toa person's risk,external, including: age (older being higher risk) ethnicity deprivation (according to postcode) weight (body mass index) underlying health issues prescribed medications Cancer patients need to take extra care High risk categories,externalinclude people: with transplanted solid organs undergoing some cancer treatments such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy on immunosuppression drugs with heart disease who are also pregnant with severe respiratory conditions (for example: cystic fibrosis, severe asthma and COPD) with rare diseases such as severe combined immunodeficiency with Down's syndrome (adults) on dialysis or with stage 5 chronic kidney disease (adults) EASY STEPS:How to keep safe A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms?

"The Scottish government has called on the Treasury to exempt the new self-isolation payment from tax. Social security secretary Shirley-Anne Somerville has written to Chancellor Rishi Sunak saying people may not apply for the Â£500 because of tax concerns. Applications for the payment, intended to help those on low incomes who are Covid-positive, opened this week. The Treasury has said tax arrangements throughout the UK will be ""fair to everyone"". In Scotland, the payments will be made through the Scottish Welfare Fund and administered by local authorities. Initially, the money will go to those on Universal Credit or similar benefits. Ms Somerville said: ""I welcome your consideration of an exemption from National Insurance contributions (NICs) and I believe a similar approach should be taken in respect of income tax. ""Subjecting these payments to tax risks detracting from the important public health measures they are intended to support. ""In a worst case scenario, the prospect of a future tax liability may prevent a person from applying, leading to them having to make the difficult choice between self-isolating and returning to work so they can support themselves financially."" She added: ""I would ask that you consider an income tax exemption in respect of payments made under the self-isolation support grant scheme, similar to the exemption you have put in place for NICs and the test and trace support payment scheme in England."" A Treasury spokeswoman said: ""We have treated the Scottish government scheme exactly the same as we have similar schemes in the rest of the UK by making it subject to income tax but also exempting it from National Insurance Contributions. That's fair to everyone. ""We have also ensured that it has no detrimental impact when calculating Universal Credit and tax credits so that no-one receiving these payments will see their welfare payments reduced.""

"Welsh Government ministers are meeting again on Sunday to discuss a 'fire-break' national lockdown Officials are ""not blind"" to the impact another national lockdown would have on the economy, Wales' health minister has said. Vaughan Gething said the concern being voiced ""weighs heavily"" on ministers. A decision on a two or three-week ""fire-break"" lockdown is expected on Monday. However, Conservative leader in the Senedd Paul Davies said he would not support the measure ""until I know what the details are"". Mr Gething told BBC Politics Waleshe recognised a circuit-breaker lockdown to slow the infection rates would have real impacts ""in terms of people being able to pay their bills"". ""We're also not blind to the fact that doing nothing means that Covid will continue to grow and we will continue to see harm,"" he added. ""We want to be able to get to the end of the year with a pattern that people can live with. ""What we can't do though is give people a guarantee that things will not happen during the winter. That depends on all the choices that we make."" The Welsh Government cabinet met on Sunday afternoon to continue its discussions, and agreed to meet again on Monday ahead of the expected announcement from First Minister Mark Drakeford. A Welsh Government spokesperson said: ""Ministers have held a number of meetings over the weekend with senior Welsh Government officials, scientists and public health experts to consider their advice on a potential need for a 'fire break' set of measures to control the virus. ""The Welsh cabinet met this evening to consider that advice. The cabinet will meet again tomorrow morning to make a final decision. The first minister will update the people of Wales on any decisions taken tomorrow."" Seventeen areas in Wales currently have local lockdown rules in place Prior to the cabinet meeting, Mr Gething insisted no final decision had been taken on lockdown measures. It follows the publication of a letter on possible dates for a short, Wales-wide lockdown. It prompted calls from the Welsh Conservatives for an emergency recall of the Senedd on Monday. ""They should come now to the Senedd tomorrow to make a statement to explain that (letter), and also to explain what their plans are, because it's unacceptable that they are actually briefing organisations and the media,"" said Mr Davies. ""They should be making the decisions and making the announcements in the Senedd, that's the point we're making."" The letter was sent to all Confederation of Passenger Transport members by the Welsh director In the letter to members of the Confederation of Passenger Transport, Wales director John Pockett said lockdown would start at 18:00 on 23 October and end on 9 November. But Mr Pockett has since told PA Media he was assuming what would happen. ""The letter is genuine and it contains what I assume or surmised would be the position,"" he said. ""It was me advising my bus operator members to be prepared for something and this is what it may well be. ""It could be more - it could be anything. I think other associations have communicated with their members in the same way."" 'Clear guidance needed' as lockdown talks continue Figuring out the stats on coronavirus in Wales 'Dark days' for tourism but with 'silver linings' How many people have died with Covid in Wales? The speculation over the possible lockdown has led to ""frustration"", said one of Wales' police and crime commissioners. Dyfed-Powys Police and Crime Commissioner Dafydd Llywelyn told BBC Radio Wales'Sunday Supplement: ""We have had meetings last week in relation to the preparation for what may be happening in the future. ""The reality, and I will be very open about this, the detail of that has not necessarily been shared in a huge amount with us and there is sometimes - and has been during the whole period - some frustration on the part of policing."" This video can not be played The BBC's Laura Foster explains what a circuit breaker is and how it could help tackle Covid-19 Plaid CymruMember of the SeneddSian Gwenllian said the Welsh Government ""must urgently set out its plans for a national fire-break"". ""We are concerned about the lack of clarity and anxiety caused by a drip-feed of information circulating in the media and elsewhere over the weekend,"" she added. Baroness Wilcox, the former head of the Welsh Local Government Association, said there was a ""growing consensus that we need a different set of measures"". ""We need different actions to respond to the virus,"" she said. The Welsh Government said: ""The measures we have put in place at both a local and a national level, with help from the public, have kept the spread of the virus under check. ""However, there is a growing consensus that we now need to introduce a different set of measures and actions to respond to the virus as it is spreading across Wales more quickly through the autumn and winter. ""We are actively considering advice from SAGE and our TAC Group. ""A 'fire-break' set of measures to control Covid-19, similar to that described in the SAGE papers, is under consideration in Wales.

"This video can not be played Andy Burnham: ""This is not just Greater Manchester's fight"" Greater Manchester's mayor has called on Boris Johnson for help in ""breaking the impasse"" over stricter Covid-19 curbs in the region. Andy Burnham said in a letter to the PM and other party leaders that Parliament should hold an urgent debate to end the deadlock. Later the mayor said he had a ""constructive call"" with Mr Johnson's chief strategic adviser. Earlier, minister Michael Gove said: ""We hope to agree a new approach."" Mr Gove said the government wanted the best for Greater Manchester and that he hoped ""we can find a way through together"". But he criticised what he described as the ""incoherence"" of politicians in that region and warned that if an agreement could not be reached the government would ""look at"" having to impose restrictions. Leaders in Greater Manchester, including Mr Burnham, have rejected a move to England's tier three alert level without better financial support. Prime Minister Boris Johnsonhas said he may ""need to intervene""if local leaders do not accept a move to tier three curbs. A further 16,982 people tested positive for the virus as of Sunday, the Department of Health figures showed, with a further 67 deaths occurring within 28 days of a positive test. Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon tweeted that the figure for positive Covid cases in Scotland should be ""treated with some caution"" due to ""a delay within the UK lab system"". Cases rose by 316 in Scotland with no further deaths recorded. The UK government said there was no capacity issue at a Lighthouse laboratory in Glasgow and that rerouting of tests to other laboratories was routine practice. Mr Burnham has said he would be ""ready to speak to the prime minister at any time"" to discuss the situation. The mayor's spokesman confirmed Mr Burnham had spoken to Sir Edward Lister, a No 10 official, in a phone call on Sunday afternoon. What Covid tier is my area in? Tier system: The street split down the middle Tory MPs clash over Manchester restrictions In the letter, Mr Burnham said the prospect of tier three - very high - restrictions on hospitality and other areas ""is not just a Greater Manchester issue"". He wrote: ""Establishing clear national entitlements of the kind we had during the first lockdown will create a sense of fairness which in turn would help build public support for, and compliance with, any new restrictions."" ""As leaders of the main political parties in Westminster, I urge you to work together to help resolve this current dispute and establish a fair financial framework for local lockdowns that the whole country will be able to support,"" he added. In the language of negotiation, it seems the government and mayor of Greater Manchester may have stepped back from the brink. Both sides softened their tone in interviews this morning, there was talk of ending the war of words and finding a new way through. But it's important to remember this is not just a two-way row. The most telling intervention of the last 24 hours has not been from Andy Burnham or Michael Gove, but the senior Conservative MP Sir Graham Brady. He represents a constituency in the region and says MPs, council leaders and mayor are ""united"" across party lines in resisting tier 3 restrictions. So, while the argument plays out in public between the government and Mr Burnham, it may be won or lost in private between ministers and their own backbenchers whose support is crucial to the government's approach. Earlier, Mr Burnham told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show there had been ""exaggeration"" by the prime minister of rising case numbers in Greater Manchester. Mr Johnson said on Friday cases in the region had doubled over the previous nine days. Mr Burnham said that while cases were ""up slightly"" they were ""certainly not doubling every nine days"". Sir Graham Brady, a senior backbench Conservative and MP for Altrincham and Sale West in Greater Manchester, described the region's Labour and Tory MPs as ""pretty united"" and said positive tests were ""flattening"". The latest data on infection rates in the city of Manchester itself show they have fallen slightly, to around 458 cases per 100,000 of the population. Across Greater Manchester as a whole - which includes another nine boroughs including Salford, Stockport and Bury - the infection rate is slightly up. So it is a mixed picture, but the region as a whole is still a long way off other areas such as Derry, Nottingham and Liverpool. But in many ways it is not the infection rate that matters. What counts are the number of people who are falling so seriously ill they end up in hospital. We know that lots of otherwise fit and healthy students falling ill with Covid-19 is not going to have a significant impact on the local health service, but lots of older people falling ill would change the picture quickly. Last week it was reported that, in Liverpool, around 95% of intensive care beds were occupied. But Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham told the BBC on Sunday morning there were only 64 occupied beds in the city region. Across Greater Manchester, leaders accept there is a serious problem. But they question whether it is serious enough to warrant the kind of economic impact - not to mention the effect on people's mental health - that moving to tier three - very high - would have. Mr Burnham also described ""side deals"" with councils in regions moving into tier three - very high - as not ""good enough for me"". Liverpool City Region's metro mayor Steve Rotherhamannounced,externalhis area will receive an additional Â£44m and a similar package worth Â£42mwas given to local leaders in Lancashire. ""Let's remember, the places they're trying to close in tier three - pubs, bookies, gyms - these are places where people are on low wages. And what we're saying is you cannot take away their place of work and not give them support,"" Mr Burnham said. He called on the government to re-introduce the 80% furlough scheme used previously in the pandemic to support the low paid affected by tier three closures. Currently,a less generous schemeto provide two-thirds of wages is on offer. Make yourself a cuppa and get up to date with Covid rules What is a circuit-breaker? The rules in your area The Labour mayor added: ""The truth is health, protecting health, is about more than controlling the virus."" TEST AND TRACE:How does it work? THREE TIERS:How will the system work? SOCIAL DISTANCING:Can I give my friends a hug? TESTING:How do I get a virus test? A letterfrom Tory MPs representing areas on the lowest tier of England's Covid alert systemcalled on Mr Burnham to accept a move to tier three - very high - rather than allow national restrictions througha so-called ""circuit-breaker"". ""It does not make sense to shut down the whole country when the virus is spiking in particular locations,"" it said. But four Conservative MPs representing seats in Greater Manchester hit back, describing the letter as ""deeply disappointing... unnecessary and ill-advised"", ""neither wanted nor helpful"" and a ""No 10 approved communication"". And Mr Burnham said: ""I'm not sure a sort of 'we're alright, Jack' letter from a group of southern Conservative MPs is going to cut much ice [in Greater Manchester]."" Meanwhile, Prof Jeremy Farrar, a scientific adviser to the government, said Christmas will be ""tough"" this year with traditional family celebrations unlikely. ""Christmas will be tough this year. I don't think it's going to be the usual celebration it is and all families coming together, I'm afraid,"" he told Sky News.

But the Wellcome Trust director said there is ""light at the end of the tunnel"", as he believes a Covid-19 vaccine and effective treatment will be ready in the first quarter of 2021.

"Welsh Government ministers are meeting again on Sunday to discuss a 'fire-break' national lockdown Officials are ""not blind"" to the impact another national lockdown would have on the economy, Wales' health minister has said. Vaughan Gething said the concern being voiced ""weighs heavily"" on ministers. A decision on a two or three-week ""fire-break"" lockdown is expected on Monday. However, Conservative leader in the Senedd Paul Davies said he would not support the measure ""until I know what the details are"". Mr Gething told BBC Politics Waleshe recognised a circuit-breaker lockdown to slow the infection rates would have real impacts ""in terms of people being able to pay their bills"". ""We're also not blind to the fact that doing nothing means that Covid will continue to grow and we will continue to see harm,"" he added. ""We want to be able to get to the end of the year with a pattern that people can live with. ""What we can't do though is give people a guarantee that things will not happen during the winter. That depends on all the choices that we make."" The Welsh Government cabinet met on Sunday afternoon to continue its discussions, and agreed to meet again on Monday ahead of the expected announcement from First Minister Mark Drakeford. A Welsh Government spokesperson said: ""Ministers have held a number of meetings over the weekend with senior Welsh Government officials, scientists and public health experts to consider their advice on a potential need for a 'fire break' set of measures to control the virus. ""The Welsh cabinet met this evening to consider that advice. The cabinet will meet again tomorrow morning to make a final decision. The first minister will update the people of Wales on any decisions taken tomorrow."" Seventeen areas in Wales currently have local lockdown rules in place Prior to the cabinet meeting, Mr Gething insisted no final decision had been taken on lockdown measures. It follows the publication of a letter on possible dates for a short, Wales-wide lockdown. It prompted calls from the Welsh Conservatives for an emergency recall of the Senedd on Monday. ""They should come now to the Senedd tomorrow to make a statement to explain that (letter), and also to explain what their plans are, because it's unacceptable that they are actually briefing organisations and the media,"" said Mr Davies. ""They should be making the decisions and making the announcements in the Senedd, that's the point we're making."" The letter was sent to all Confederation of Passenger Transport members by the Welsh director In the letter to members of the Confederation of Passenger Transport, Wales director John Pockett said lockdown would start at 18:00 on 23 October and end on 9 November. But Mr Pockett has since told PA Media he was assuming what would happen. ""The letter is genuine and it contains what I assume or surmised would be the position,"" he said. ""It was me advising my bus operator members to be prepared for something and this is what it may well be. ""It could be more - it could be anything. I think other associations have communicated with their members in the same way."" 'Clear guidance needed' as lockdown talks continue Figuring out the stats on coronavirus in Wales 'Dark days' for tourism but with 'silver linings' How many people have died with Covid in Wales? The speculation over the possible lockdown has led to ""frustration"", said one of Wales' police and crime commissioners. Dyfed-Powys Police and Crime Commissioner Dafydd Llywelyn told BBC Radio Wales'Sunday Supplement: ""We have had meetings last week in relation to the preparation for what may be happening in the future. ""The reality, and I will be very open about this, the detail of that has not necessarily been shared in a huge amount with us and there is sometimes - and has been during the whole period - some frustration on the part of policing.""

Baroness Wilcox, the former head of the Welsh Local Government Association, said there was a ""growing consensus that we need a different set of measures"". ""We need different actions to respond to the virus,"" she said. The Welsh Government said: ""The measures we have put in place at both a local and a national level, with help from the public, have kept the spread of the virus under check. ""However, there is a growing consensus that we now need to introduce a different set of measures and actions to respond to the virus as it is spreading across Wales more quickly through the autumn and winter. ""We are actively considering advice from SAGE and our TAC Group. ""A 'fire-break' set of measures to control Covid-19, similar to that described in the SAGE papers, is under consideration in Wales.

"This video can not be played Elephant conservationist lauds ""huge result"" ""We've gone 12 months without an elephant being shot and killed by poachers at Mana Pools National Park, which is a huge result."" For Nick Murray, a conservationist born in Pontypridd, this result has followed years of hard work. Nick now runs a conservation project with his wife Desiree covering the Lower Zambezi Valley of Zimbabwe, an area of 10,000 sq km (3,800 sq miles). Over the past 23 years, he has seen the wildlife populations of the valley decrease rapidly. In particular, the elephant population at the Unesco World Heritage site has nearly halved in the past two decades from 20,000 to 12,000. Nick said poaching had ""hammered"" the elephant population, and the drop in tourists caused by the coronavirus pandemic was expected to lead to an increase in the illegal practice. Thankfully that has been avoided. The anti-poaching work of Bushlife Conservancy - the project Nick runs - is complex and dangerous, training armed national park rangers to protect the animals, and keeping rangers mobile via boats and jeeps to track wild animals. Nick Murray has worked with Sir David Attenborough, advising a BBC crew filming in Zimbabwe The 52-year-old said: ""In 2008 and 2009 it was really bad. Poachers would put cyanide in trees targeting elephants, but when that was too slow they'd poison the watering holes. ""The aim was to kill elephants but the results were it would kill all wildlife which drank from it, from a little bird to a leopard or a lion. ""On one occasion a pack of wild dogs, which are an endangered species, eight elephants and a number of other animals were killed at a poisoned watering hole. That really brought it home that we needed to up our game. ""It wasn't just a case of listening out for gun shots and tracking poachers down anymore, you've got to be proactive and be there to prevent them getting to the watering holes. ""Thankfully, with the hard effort we've put in with Zimbabwe national park rangers, we've curbed that."" Walking with elephants is a ""unique experience"", says Nick Nick studied Zoology at university in South Africa and has guided in many African countries. He has spent the past 23 years canoeing the Zambezi River and working in all the wildlife areas of Zimbabwe. ""I got interested in wildlife at a very young age. I remember being in Swansea with my grandfather, who played rugby for Wales - a gentleman called Dai Thomas - and he gave me a BBC wildlife magazine from 1971. That was my earliest stimulation into my passion for wildlife. ""An elephant is such an intelligent animal so it's about spending time with them because they can smell you and recognise your voice, but they also know who you are by a vibe from your body and you can just sense each other's mood. Some will seek out human company. ""It's a unique experience and Mana is one of the few places you can get out and walk with these amazing creatures."" The country that brought its elephants back from the brink The war on elephants Secrets of male elephant society revealed in the wild The conservation project constantly monitors the herds by first collaring the animal. A vet will fire an anaesthetic dart, then the team works quickly to attach the tracker before an antidote is injected. ""A lot of the big bulls [male elephants] were wiped out by poaching. If they leave the national park and go into hunting areas, we can act on that now. ""If the collar is reading stationary, that triggers an alarm that alerts us to the animal and we can go and investigate, and if he's been poached we can follow that up."" Elephants are poached for their ivory tusks Coronavirus has hit Zimbabwe's tourism industry hard and fewer tourists usually leads to an increase in poaching, but the rangers and conservation teams have been working hard to prevent it. ""Tourism is a major factor toward conservation and without the tourist camps being open there's been no presence. ""The park has been an empty shell except for a few rangers, but they have managed to keep poaching at bay, which is a fantastic success."" Elephants use their tusks to protect themselves, move objects and gather food, but their ivory is highly lucrative on the illegal market. A study published in 2016 estimated up to 40,000 elephants were being killed by poachers - who remove the tusks with an axe - every year. In 2018,all trade in ivory in China was banned, but the illegal market is still thriving. The price can be as much as $2,000 (about Â£1,500) a kilogram. ""Ivory has been sought after by man for thousands of years, but it's the market in the Far East which drives the poaching,"" said Nick. ""China has done a lot recently to try and stop the trade but it's just driven it further underground. ""A large well-carved ivory tusk in China could go for $100,000. ""The poacher on the ground, who is risking his life, will get around $500. So the further away from Africa it goes the higher the price goes."" He said poaching was indiscriminate, killing of all sexes and ages of elephant. ""But over the last five years there have been over 300 arrests and 1,500 years of jail time handed down, so this has also been a massive deterrent."" Nick got involved in conservation work after seeing the results of poaching for himself It was seeing the effects of poaching for himself that got Nick involved in his current role. ""I was guiding one backpacking photography safari 10 years ago and we got surrounded by poachers at a watering hole. ""There were vultures all around this amphitheatre at the spring, so you could tell from that how many elephants had been killed there. ""It was a dozen and we found another bunch of dead elephants in the next valley. We alerted the park rangers and luckily the poachers were caught. ""So, just from that one walk 30 pairs of elephant tusks were recovered and 11 poachers arrested. It was from that one safari that it really brought it home to me that the level of poaching was horrendous and that's what made me so determined to start this conservation work and do what we've been doing."" Nick is due to start advising on a new series with Sir David Attenborough In 2017, Nick finished guiding and advising a BBC crew on a film shoot capturing wild dogs (also known as painted wolves) for Sir David Attenborough's Dynasties series. He will start working on a new Attenborough series called Green Planet this month, while continuing to focus on his conservation work. ""We are proud of what we've done and the impact it has had. It's been far greater than I thought we would be able to achieve,"" Nick said. ""We were losing an elephant a day in the valley through poaching and now we have not lost one in Mana for 12 months - that's unbelievable. At this rate it means the elephant population here will increase by 5% per annum.""

"Firms are calling for more financial support to avoid ""catastrophic consequences"" from tougher coronavirus restrictions. Without more help there could be mass redundancies and business failures, the British Chambers of Commerce warns. Its call for a new approach comes as tougher restrictions are imposed on large parts of the UK. The government said it had already put in place support worth more than Â£200bn to help firms cope. ""We know this continues to be a very difficult period for businesses,"" a spokesman said. ""That's why we have put in place a substantial package of support."" The government has already announced extra supportfor firms affected by new measures to control the virus, including providing two thirds of workers' wages where firms have been told to close. Firms will also receive grants of up to Â£3,000 per month. There is additional funding for local authorities and devolved administrations. The director general of the BCC, which represents 75,000 firms of varying sizes across the UK, has written to the prime minister calling for a new set of criteria to be applied before imposing tougher restrictions. ""The situation for business grows graver by the day,"" Adam Marshall wrote. ""Enhanced support must be given to those facing the indirect impacts of restrictions and closures - in supply chains, tourist destinations and town and city centres."" Coronavirus drives shop closures to new record Row over Covid rules 'not just about Manchester' Make yourself a cuppa and get up to date with Covid rules The letter,externaloutlines a set of conditions firms would like to see in place before restrictions are imposed. It says there should be evidence of the effectiveness of the proposed measures, businesses should be given time to prepare, and financial support should be available, both for firms forced to closed, and those indirectly affected. While some businesses are required to close in areas under the strictest measures, many more firms say their business will be badly affected by a drop in demand as people are asked to limit some activities, travel and socialise less. Some businesses in England say they would rather be closed down under the tier three (very high alert) measures and receive financial support, than see demand for their services destroyed in a tier two (high) area, the BCC said. TEST AND TRACE:How does it work? THREE TIERS:How will the system work? SOCIAL DISTANCING:Can I give my friends a hug? TESTING:How do I get a virus test? The prime minister announced the new three tier system for England last week - pointing to sharply-rising transmission rates for the virus in some parts of the country. Mr Johnson told the House of Commons: ""This is not how we want to live our lives but this is the narrow path we have to tread between the social and economic trauma of a full lockdown and the massive human, and indeed, economic cost of an uncontained epidemic."" The government has introduced the toughest tier three restrictions in Liverpool and Lancashire, which means pubs and bars not serving food must close and households are not permitted to mix. Many other parts of England, including London, York and Essex, are now in tier two, the second highest level of measures. This means people from different households may not meet indoors including inside cafes and restaurants. In Northern Ireland, pubs, restaurants and cafes have closed to sit-in customers for the next four weeks, while in Scotland's central belt most licensed premises are closed under temporary restrictions. In Wales, a two-week ""fire break"" - a period with tighter restrictions to help break the trajectory of coronavirus cases rising - is expected within days. The BCC is also calling for changes to theNHS Test and Trace system. ""The need for additional restrictions cannot be blamed on a lack of care by hardworking people in businesses across the country,"" the letter said. ""Instead it represents a failure of the test and trace system, which must be urgently improved and expanded."" It suggests any period of enhanced restrictions should be used to speed up the effectiveness of NHS Test and Trace, including putting a focus on rapid testing and low-cost testing in workplaces. Cabinet minister Michael Gove told the BBC's Andrew Marr programme that the number of people being tested was higher than ever before and that ""contact-tracing was improving all the time"". But he said that ""any test and trace system has less utility as the virus grows"". Since the start of the pandemic, the number of people employed across the UK is down by around half a million, according to the Office for National Statistics, while some self-employed workers and entrepreneurs have lost significant amounts of work. The government provided support to employees and businesses at the start of lockdown in March, including VAT cuts, business rates holidays, extended loan schemes and the furlough scheme which provided 80% of wages for those unable to continue working. However, the furlough scheme is being phased out, and will be replaced at the end of this month by a less generousjob support scheme.

"Welsh Government ministers are meeting again on Sunday to discuss a 'fire-break' national lockdown Officials are ""not blind"" to the impact another national lockdown would have on the economy, Wales' health minister has said. Vaughan Gething said the concern being voiced ""weighs heavily"" on ministers. A decision on a two or three-week ""fire-break"" lockdown is expected on Monday. However, Conservative leader in the Senedd Paul Davies said he would not support the measure ""until I know what the details are"". Mr Gething told BBC Politics Waleshe recognised a circuit-breaker lockdown to slow the infection rates would have real impacts ""in terms of people being able to pay their bills"". ""We're also not blind to the fact that doing nothing means that Covid will continue to grow and we will continue to see harm,"" he added. ""We want to be able to get to the end of the year with a pattern that people can live with. ""What we can't do though is give people a guarantee that things will not happen during the winter. That depends on all the choices that we make."" The Welsh Government cabinet met on Sunday afternoon to continue its discussions, and agreed to meet again on Monday ahead of the expected announcement from First Minister Mark Drakeford. A Welsh Government spokesperson said: ""Ministers have held a number of meetings over the weekend with senior Welsh Government officials, scientists and public health experts to consider their advice on a potential need for a 'fire break' set of measures to control the virus. ""The Welsh cabinet met this evening to consider that advice. The cabinet will meet again tomorrow morning to make a final decision. The first minister will update the people of Wales on any decisions taken tomorrow."" Seventeen areas in Wales currently have local lockdown rules in place Prior to the cabinet meeting, Mr Gething insisted no final decision had been taken on lockdown measures. It follows the publication of a letter on possible dates for a short, Wales-wide lockdown. It prompted calls from the Welsh Conservatives for an emergency recall of the Senedd on Monday. ""They should come now to the Senedd tomorrow to make a statement to explain that (letter), and also to explain what their plans are, because it's unacceptable that they are actually briefing organisations and the media,"" said Mr Davies. ""They should be making the decisions and making the announcements in the Senedd, that's the point we're making."" The letter was sent to all Confederation of Passenger Transport members by the Welsh director In the letter to members of the Confederation of Passenger Transport, Wales director John Pockett said lockdown would start at 18:00 on 23 October and end on 9 November. But Mr Pockett has since told PA Media he was assuming what would happen. ""The letter is genuine and it contains what I assume or surmised would be the position,"" he said. ""It was me advising my bus operator members to be prepared for something and this is what it may well be. ""It could be more - it could be anything. I think other associations have communicated with their members in the same way."" 'Clear guidance needed' as lockdown talks continue Figuring out the stats on coronavirus in Wales 'Dark days' for tourism but with 'silver linings' How many people have died with Covid in Wales? The speculation over the possible lockdown has led to ""frustration"", said one of Wales' police and crime commissioners. Dyfed-Powys Police and Crime Commissioner Dafydd Llywelyn told BBC Radio Wales'Sunday Supplement: ""We have had meetings last week in relation to the preparation for what may be happening in the future. ""The reality, and I will be very open about this, the detail of that has not necessarily been shared in a huge amount with us and there is sometimes - and has been during the whole period - some frustration on the part of policing."" This video can not be played The BBC's Laura Foster explains what a circuit breaker is and how it could help tackle Covid-19 Plaid CymruMember of the SeneddSian Gwenllian said the Welsh Government ""must urgently set out its plans for a national fire-break"". ""We are concerned about the lack of clarity and anxiety caused by a drip-feed of information circulating in the media and elsewhere over the weekend,"" she added. Baroness Wilcox, the former head of the Welsh Local Government Association, said there was a ""growing consensus that we need a different set of measures"". ""We need different actions to respond to the virus,"" she said. The Welsh Government said: ""The measures we have put in place at both a local and a national level, with help from the public, have kept the spread of the virus under check. ""However, there is a growing consensus that we now need to introduce a different set of measures and actions to respond to the virus as it is spreading across Wales more quickly through the autumn and winter. ""We are actively considering advice from SAGE and our TAC Group. ""A 'fire-break' set of measures to control Covid-19, similar to that described in the SAGE papers, is under consideration in Wales.

"This video can not be played Michael Gove: ""We hope the EU will change their position"" The door is ""still ajar"" for talks with the EU over a post-Brexit trade deal but only if it moves ground in key areas, Michael Gove has said. He said the EU must speed up the negotiations and offer better terms. It comes as the EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier will not travel to London for talks tomorrow but will join ""remotely, as planned"", his team said. Negotiations between the UK and the EU have stalled amid disagreements over fishing access and competition issues. The EU has said it is prepared to ""intensify"" talks but it would not agree a deal at ""any price"". The CBI and other business organisations urged the UK government to focus on bridging its differences with the EU, saying a deal was vital to help the post-Covid recovery. They warned that uncertainty about the UK's future trading relationship with its largest market was ""chipping away at business resilience"" at a time when many firms were being battered by coronavirus. UK's trade talks with EU are over, says No 10 What are the sticking points in Brexit trade talks? What is the 'no-deal' Australia option? Downing Street said on Friday that official negotiations over a future economic partnership were ""over"" and the UK should ""get ready"" to trade with the EU from 1 January without a specific agreement. Boris Johnson has accused the EU of resisting the UK's preferred outcome of a deal based onthe one the bloc has with Canada. The prime minister has said the UK should now be prepared for the alternative of a much more limited relationship, based on the EU's existing arrangements with Australia. However, this would see tariffs applied on goods crossing the channel once the UK leaves the EU's single market at the end of the year, pushing up the cost of imports and exports. The EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, was due in London for talks with his counterpart, David Frost, on Monday, but the UK said this would be pointless without a fundamental change in direction from the bloc. Senior EU sources had indicated on Friday that Mr Barnier would be attending in person. But it is now expected that he will hold a video conference call with Lord Frost to discuss the structure of any future talks. Mr Gove told the BBC's Andrew Marr that the EU ""effectively ended the current round of talks"" when its 27 leaders met in Brussels on Thursday to take stock of progress and said more was required from the UK. ""It was the case we were making progress but then the EU retreated from that,"" he said. ""We have drawn the conclusion that unless their approach changes, they are not interested and they have in effect drawn stumps."" Michael Gove said the EU ""effectively ended the current round of talks"" in Brussels Mr Johnson previously indicated that the UK would walk away from the talks unless EU leaders agreed an outline deal at last week's summit in Brussels. Asked by Andrew Marr whether the UK was engaging in sabre-rattling or the door was still ajar to further discussions, Mr Gove replied: ""It is still ajar. We hope the EU will change their position and we are certainly not saying if they do change their position we can't talk to them."" Mr Gove said the UK was preparing for a range of outcomes, including leaving on what he described as ""Australian terms"", which would see trade between the two partners default to World Trade Organization rules. ""That is not going to be a picnic,"" he said on this scenario. ""The key thing is we are taking the steps alongside business to be ready for that outcome."" This video can not be played ""We've left, now we need to decide some important trade aspects"": Michael Gove says UK still holds cards for negotiations And he said he was ""not embarrassed"" by comments he made during the 2016 EU referendum campaign, when he was a key figure in the Vote Leave campaign, when he claimed that reaching a trade deal would ""not be any more complicated or onerous than the day-to-day work"" of the UK's diplomats. He said the remarks, and comments in a March 2019 newspaper interview in which he said the British public did not vote for Brexit in order to leave without a deal, should be placed ""in context"", given the UK had since negotiated a withdrawal agreement and left the EU. Businesses have warned that a failure to reach a deal will accentuate the damage done by the Covid pandemic. Trade bodies representing 190,000 firms have written to Mr Gove urging him to reach an agreement. ""With each day that passes, business resilience is chipped away,"" the CBI and other groups said. ""A swift deal is the single most effective way to support recovery in communities across Europe. ""After four years of debate, there must be a resolution. 2021 can then be a year to rebuild, rather than regret.""

"The Scottish government has called on the Treasury to exempt the new self-isolation payment from tax. Social security secretary Shirley-Anne Somerville has written to Chancellor Rishi Sunak saying people may not apply for the Â£500 because of tax concerns. Applications for the payment, intended to help those on low incomes who are Covid-positive, opened this week. The Treasury has said tax arrangements throughout the UK will be ""fair to everyone"". In Scotland, the payments will be made through the Scottish Welfare Fund and administered by local authorities. Initially, the money will go to those on Universal Credit or similar benefits. Ms Somerville said: ""I welcome your consideration of an exemption from National Insurance contributions (NICs) and I believe a similar approach should be taken in respect of income tax. ""Subjecting these payments to tax risks detracting from the important public health measures they are intended to support. ""In a worst case scenario, the prospect of a future tax liability may prevent a person from applying, leading to them having to make the difficult choice between self-isolating and returning to work so they can support themselves financially."" She added: ""I would ask that you consider an income tax exemption in respect of payments made under the self-isolation support grant scheme, similar to the exemption you have put in place for NICs and the test and trace support payment scheme in England."" A Treasury spokeswoman said: ""We have treated the Scottish government scheme exactly the same as we have similar schemes in the rest of the UK by making it subject to income tax but also exempting it from National Insurance Contributions. That's fair to everyone. ""We have also ensured that it has no detrimental impact when calculating Universal Credit and tax credits so that no-one receiving these payments will see their welfare payments reduced.""

"This video can not be played ""Time is of the essence"" for Manchester - Boris Johnson Boris Johnson says the spread of coronavirus in Greater Manchester is ""grave"" and he may ""need to intervene"" if new measures are not agreed. The prime minister urged mayor Andy Burnham to ""engage constructively"" with the government over the region entering ""very high"" tier three measures. He said the situation was worsening every day and ""time is of the essence"". Mr Burnham, who wants more financial aid for workers affected, said regional leaders will meet No 10 at ""any time"". Measures under tier three include pub closures and a ban on household mixing indoors, in private gardens and in most outdoor venues. Liverpool City Region was the first of England's regions to enter the very high alert level. Lancashire has agreed to move into tier three from Saturdaywith a financial support package worth Â£42m. Around 1.5 million people, including those living in Blackburn, Blackpool, Burnley, Lancaster and Preston, will be affected by the new rules. What are the tier 2 and tier 3 rules coming in this weekend? Can I stay with my partner in tier 2? And other questions Lancashire rising to highest Covid alert level What is a circuit-breaker? PM appears confused over single parent rules Speaking at a Downing Street briefing on Friday, Mr Johnson said he understood the ""reluctance"" of local leaders to put the region under tougher restrictions and said it would be ""far from a pain-free course of action"". He warned: ""Of course, if agreement cannot be reached I will need to intervene in order to protect Manchester's hospitals and save the lives of Manchester's residents. ""But our efforts would be so much more effective if we work together."" Revealing that a deal had not been reached between No 10 and the region's leaders, Mr Johnson said it was time for action to be taken. ""Each day that passes before action is taken means more people will go to hospital, more people will end up in intensive care and tragically more people will die,"" he said. In a joint statement with Greater Manchester's deputy mayors and council leaders, Mr Burnham said they had sought a further meeting with Downing Street officials - and this did not happen. ""We can assure the prime minister that we are ready to meet at any time to try to agree a way forward,"" they said. They said they had done ""everything within our power to protect the health of our residents"" but are not convinced that closing pubs and bars is the only way to protect hospitals. Instead, they want other measures like shielding to be considered, and tougher penalties on venues that do not comply to Covid regulations, including instant closure powers. ""We firmly believe that protecting health is about more than controlling the virus and requires proper support for people whose lives would be severely affected by a tier three lockdown,"" they said, adding that the current proposals do not ""provide adequate support"". Andy Burnham says northern England has been treated with contempt The latest government figures showed there were 15,650 new cases reported on Friday, bringing the total to 689,257. There were a further 136 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test, bringing the total to 43,429. Mr Johnson said he hoped the most stringent ""very high"" restrictions could be lifted as quickly as possible for the affected regions. He said: ""The amount by which we need to reduce the R is not as big as it was right back in the beginning of the spread of this disease. ""If we all work together on the measures we have outlined we can definitely do it."" The reproduction (R) number has risen slightly to 1.3-1.5, with growth of the epidemic still widespread across the country. The PM said he wanted to avoid another national lockdown ""if at all possible"" amid calls for a circuit-breaker - a short, limited lockdown - across the country. He said he disagreed with those who argued in favour of a national lockdown ""instead of targeted local action"", insisting: ""Closing businesses in Cornwall where transmission is low will not cut transmission in Manchester"". Mr Johnson said that while he could not ""rule anything out"", he wanted to avoid a national lockdown because of ""the damaging health, economic and social effects it would have"". The UK government's chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance said during the briefing that the nation is in a ""different situation"" from when the Sage group of scientists recommended a two-to-three week national ""circuit break"" to stop the spread of coronavirus. He said the situation had changed, adding: ""We recommended in September taking a circuit break. The idea there was that actually a two-week interruption would set cases back probably to the levels they were in August and then at those levels, test and trace is more effective to keep control. ""Where we are now is of course a different situation. It's crucial that where the R is above 1 and the numbers are high we get R below 1 for all the reasons that have been outlined, including of course the hospitalisations which are increasing. So it's crucial that's done, and there are a number of ways that can be done."" He added that would only be achieved by combining ""tier three baseline conditions"" suggested by the government with some extra measures agreed in an affected region using ""local knowledge and local insight"".

Enter a full UK postcode or council name to find out This information was updated on 26 January at 10:15 GMT         The PM said accepting increased coronavirus restrictions was the ""right and responsible"" measure to protect the NHS. He added: ""Without action, there is no doubt that our NHS would soon be struggling to treat the sheer number of people seriously ill with Covid. ""Non-Covid treatments and surgeries would need to be cancelled to cope and many more people would die."" Labour's shadow health minister Alex Norris MP said it was ""damaging"" for Mr Johnson to avoid a full lockdown and that the regional approach is not enough. ""We need this circuit-breaker to give us time to sort these significant problems in testing and tracing,"" he said. ""We've had the worst week last week for tracing. The system's falling over. The prime minister is desperate to avoid lockdown just as he was at the beginning of the pandemic - but we know that that delay at the beginning was really damaging."" On Thursday, London, Essex, York and parts of Surrey, Derbyshire and Cumbria were moved up to tier two and will face tougher measures from Saturday. More than half of England's population will now be living under high or very high-alert restrictions. The PM also revealed that the UK is developing the capacity to manufacture millions of new fast turnaround tests for coronavirus - with some saliva tests able to deliver results in 15 minutes. He said distribution and trials of the tests would start over ""the next few weeks"" and would enable NHS and care home staff to be tested ""more frequently"". Schoolchildren and university students would also be able to be tested, he said, to help keep education ""open safely over the winter"".

"Manchester has resisted being put into the ""very high risk"" tier Early in the pandemic, the government consistently said it was ""following the science"" - but what does that really mean, and is the divergence between politics and science now wider than it has ever been? Some with heels clacking on the cobbles, others capturing the moment on their phones - it's like the aftermath of a big win in the football, or the Saturday after pay day. The videos show Concert Square in Liverpool heaving with crowds. And this in a city on the crest of a second wave of coronavirus, where almost all the intensive care beds in the hospitals are full. It was Tuesday night, hours away from the Liverpool City Region entering the toughest restrictions in the country. But the footage sparked anger, and on Twitter there was a fight over the damage to the city's reputation. This video can not be played Crowds gather in Liverpool on eve of new Covid rules Dozens of tweets insisted that those present must have been students, that no true Liverpudlian would set foot in Concert Square, let alone behave like that. The tweeters were adamant - these people came from outside. The mayor and the metro mayor condemned the scenes - but that wasn't the only thing they were angry about. They accused the government at Westminster of not providing enough financial support - workers affected by the closure of businesses such as bars and gyms will only get two-thirds of their wages. On the first day of lockdown,one gym ownershowed his defiance by remaining open and was fined for it. Gyms have indeed provided a source of confusion. Liverpool mayor Joe Anderson questioned why gyms in the Liverpool City Region had to close when the area moved into tier three - very high alert - but those in Lancashire, which went into tier three on Saturday, were allowed to stay open. Liverpool was the first place in England to go into the strictest measures In Blackburn, with 438 cases per 100,000 (in the week to 13 October), you can work out, but in Wirral, with 284 cases per 100,000, you can't. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has acknowledged inconsistencies. ""There are anomalies, that's inevitably going to happen in a complex campaign against a pandemic like this."" But do these discrepancies encourage those who feel the government's decision-making sometimes veers away from the science? ""Following the science"" was a phrase we heard a lot of earlier in the year. It's what, we were repeatedly told, the government at Westminster was doing. This video can not be played Liverpool pub worker talks emotionally about job fears The reality was always more nuanced. There was a range of scientific views on a topic about which precious little was known at the outset, and there are still vast amounts to learn. Added to that, from the perspective of ministers, this could never only be about scientific advice. There was a constant swirl of broader considerations, what we might call the three Ls - lives, liberties and livelihoods. Ministers have been tussling with the three Ls from the start of the pandemic. But the divergence has never been wider than it is now. Nick Triggle is the BBC's health correspondent@NickTriggle,external Chris Mason is a BBC political correspondent@ChrisMasonBBC,external Claire Hamilton is the BBC's political reporter for Merseyside@chamiltonbbc,external The critical moment in recent weeks can be traced back to 21 September, when Sir Patrick Vallance, the UK's chief scientific adviser and Prof Chris Whitty, the UK's chief medical adviser, warned of the need for immediate action. In a televised briefing, Sir Patrick warned cases could reach 50,000 a day by mid-October if they doubled every seven days, as had happened in recent weeks. Chris Whitty and Patrick Vallance on 21 September We now know that on that same day, the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) met and suggested the ""immediate introduction"" of a ""short period of lockdown,"" and a series of longer term measures, including: working from home where possible ""banning all contact within the home with members of other households"" ""closure of all bars, restaurants, cafes, indoor gyms"" and hairdressers all university and college teaching moved online. A day later, what actually happened? The prime minister said people should work from home if they could and a 22:00 curfew for pubs and restaurants was introduced. In other words, not a lot of change. What happened to ""following the science""? Plenty at Westminster whispered, even before we had seen the minutes from the Sage meeting, that this was a victory for those in government, like Chancellor Rishi Sunak, who worried about the pandemic's crippling economic consequences. What Covid tier is my area in? Mr Sunak has been consistent - warning again, just this week, of the danger of ""rushing to another lockdown"". He warned, instead, of the ""economic emergency"", touching on another of the three Ls - livelihoods. When you speak to people in the Treasury, you get an insight into what informs this outlook. ""We have to keep an eye on the medium term. There may not be a vaccine. Listening to the scientists recently, the mood music has changed. They're more pessimistic,"" says one. This is no longer about dealing with a short-term emergency, but being resilient through a medium or long-term slog of a crisis. And that means the Treasury is well aware of what is going out - in public spending - and what is coming in, in taxes. ""There isn't the headroom there was,"" an insider says - a reference to the Â£200bn already spent. And there is a keen awareness of the economic consequences of shutting pubs. ""Our economy is comparatively very reliant on social consumption,"" is how it is described. The experts know the ministers have to take into account a variety of factors. One Sage member said: ""Our job is to give clear unvarnished science advice so they can do that with their eyes open."" On Tuesday, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer advocated a short, limited lockdown - the circuit-breaker suggested by the scientific advisers. But does Sir Keir calling for a circuit-breaker make it more or less likely to happen? Since then, the government - to quote Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab - has been ""leaning in"" to its regional response for England. Political convention says, everything else being equal, it is harder to adopt a policy advocated by your opponents than it is by independent advisers. Then there's the last of the three Ls. Liberties. Boris Johnson, 21 September 2020 Among the most influential Conservative backbench voices is Sir Graham Brady, who said ministers had got used to ""ruling by decree"" and ""the British people aren't used to being treated like children"". This unease at how the pandemic has, in their view, swept away some of the checks and balances on those in power, is widely held in Parliament. Then there's the question of geography. First there was devolution for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, but now we're all aware of the big English cities that have metro mayors because they are fighting back against Westminster. According to well-placed sources, Health Secretary Matt Hancock had argued for tougher measures in private. But the need to get local leaders on board has meant the tiered system has had to leave some wriggle room for negotiation. Ministers were stung when Middlesbrough mayor Andy Preston said he flatly rejected the restrictions that the government announced there in early October. ""It was a real problem for us - it undermined the public health message and threatened to undo what we were trying to achieve,"" one government source said. Steve Rotheram, Metro Mayor of the Liverpool City Region, had been asking for a lockdown circuit-breaker for at least two weeks - but he said any measures must come with a bespoke financial support package for businesses. It appears this hasn't been forthcoming. Andy Burnham outside Manchester town hall this week But the mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, has gone much further than his colleague in Liverpool. On Friday, he was described as ""effectively trying to hold the government over a barrel"" by Mr Raab. Mr Burnham, a former Labour cabinet minister, who lost out to Jeremy Corbyn in the 2015 Labour leadership contest, is suddenly back on the national stage. He is demanding noisily and frequently the need for more generous support for those unable to work because of tier three restrictions. There is nervousness within the Labour Party nationally, and elsewhere in the north of England, about this stance. Some worry it imperils people's health, others that it's become ""the Andy show"" - as one figure put it. The idea of ""metro mayors"" voted for directly by the people of the region has long been championed by the Conservatives. David Cameron was a particular fan.

""And remember this, Boris Johnson was a mayor. There is a path to Downing Street that can pass via a town hall. Perhaps Andy Burnham has realised that too."" What we are seeing is how different parts of the UK have tilted in different directions. Loyalty to region, to nation, to party. The legacies of past perceived slights and injustices. The realities of perceived injustices now. ""We owe a big thanks to George Osborne for bequeathing us this incredible standoff,"" a senior Conservative says about the row. Some Conservative ministers ponder privately that - in the end - Mr Sunak will be forced to be more generous to those unable to work under tier three restrictions. They don't think it'll be politically sustainable to pay people normally on the minimum wage, less than the minimum wage, for months on end. The rows between local and central government leaders are ""very dangerous"" and ""very damaging to public health"", according to Prof Sir Jeremy Farrar, Sage member, and director of the Wellcome Trust. But these are not the only rows that have been taking place. Across the scientific and medical community tempers are frayed and the pandemic is taking its toll. There is a network of committees that feed into Sage, bringing together a wide range of experts from sociologists and public health directors to epidemiologists. Many are not paid for their advice and instead are fitting it in around their day jobs. ""We do it because we care and it's our life's work,"" said Prof Devi Sridhar, an expert in global public health at Edinburgh University, who has been advising the Scottish government. Talk to these experts and it is clear they are exhausted. ""The requests just keep coming in,"" one said. ""We're fed up, especially when we hear that test-and-trace consultants are getting paid Â£7,000 a day, and we have to put up with MPs going on the TV telling the world we are naÃ¯ve and don't live in the real world. It's demoralising."" But it is not just between politicians and scientists that disputes have developed. Rival camps of scientists are clashing. Two online petitions have now been established: the Great Barrington declaration for those who want to see controlled spread of the virus and protection of the vulnerable, and the John Snow Memorandum for those arguing for outright suppression until a vaccine is developed. Prof Francois Balloux, director of the UCL Genetics Institute, says the toxic atmosphere that is developing is really ""unhelpful"". Brought together, it has created a climate where almost every utterance or development is examined for double-meaning. The problem facing advisers and decision-makers is two-fold. First, the nature of the virus means it is a lose-lose situation - whatever decision is taken has negative consequences either for the spread of the virus, or for the economy, education and wider health and well-being. What's more, there is not a simple binary choice of one thing or the other. For example, much has been made in recent weeks about the need for the NHS to also focus on non-Covid work, which has taken a terrible hit during the pandemic. Referrals for urgent cancer check-ups and the number of people starting treatment have dropped, while the amount of routine surgery being done is still half the level it was before the pandemic. THREE TIERS:How will the system work? SOCIAL DISTANCING:Can I give my friends a hug? PAY-PACKET SUPPORT:What will I be paid under the new scheme? SUPPORT BUBBLES:What are they and who can be in yours? FACE MASKS:When do I need to wear one? This can have tragic consequences. This week the British Heart Foundation warned the number of younger adults dying of heart disease had increased by 15% during the pandemic. The argument put forward by some is that the government should choose to do more non-Covid work. But, and this is a point the health secretary has been making week after week, if hospitals fill up with coronavirus patients, it makes non-Covid work harder to do. The second key issue - and this goes to the heart of the disagreements we have seen bubble up in recent weeks among the scientific and medical community - is that there are huge gaps in the evidence and knowledge. This is true on everything from the numbers infected already and the level of immunity exposure brings to the true impact of ""long Covid"", and exactly what effect any restrictions beyond a full lockdown actually have. In normal times, the scientific and medical community is able to reach more of a consensus off the back of rigorous randomised controlled trials and painstaking peer review. But in a fast-moving pandemic with a new virus, that has simply not been possible. Paul Hunter, a professor of medicine at the University of East Anglia, says it means there is such ""uncertainty in the science"" that he does not think any plan is guaranteed to work. And then there is the human factor - the unintended consequences of actions that are impossible to take into account in the modelling. Hence the prospect of scenes like the ones we saw in Liverpool, which were not taken into account by Sage in its latest advice. But Prof Keith Neal, an infectious disease expert at Nottingham University, says it shouldn't come as a surprise that people react in the way they do. Both young and old are suffering, he says, from not being able to meet up with people. ""This degree of isolation is not allowed in prisons under human rights legislation."" People from different households will not be able to drink together inside, after London went into tier two It is, he says, therefore natural that some people will ignore the rules. Closing pubs may sound good on paper, he says, but it could lead to an increase in house parties where people are ""far more at risk"". So where has this left us? The complexity of competing interests, uncertainty in the science and general exhaustion across society both among decision-makers and the public has, some fear, left us in the worst of both worlds. Delay and deliberation, says Sir Jeremy Farrar is a ""decision in itself"". But by reaching a decision by default there is a risk - another adviser says - of making the same mistakes we made at the start of the pandemic. ""In March we toyed with the Swedish model of limited restrictions with the hope of developing immunity and then hesitated. But we then went for a lockdown, but it was introduced bit by bit and it was too late anyway. ""The same thing has happened again - we have delayed and then gone for some half measures. I can understand why. This is bloody difficult."" The government is now hoping it will be just enough that we can get through this wave without a devastating number of deaths or hospitals being overwhelmed. But it's a big risk - it could all unravel.

"Firms are calling for more financial support to avoid ""catastrophic consequences"" from tougher coronavirus restrictions. Without more help there could be mass redundancies and business failures, the British Chambers of Commerce warns. Its call for a new approach comes as tougher restrictions are imposed on large parts of the UK. The government said it had already put in place support worth more than Â£200bn to help firms cope. ""We know this continues to be a very difficult period for businesses,"" a spokesman said. ""That's why we have put in place a substantial package of support."" The government has already announced extra supportfor firms affected by new measures to control the virus, including providing two thirds of workers' wages where firms have been told to close. Firms will also receive grants of up to Â£3,000 per month. There is additional funding for local authorities and devolved administrations. The director general of the BCC, which represents 75,000 firms of varying sizes across the UK, has written to the prime minister calling for a new set of criteria to be applied before imposing tougher restrictions. ""The situation for business grows graver by the day,"" Adam Marshall wrote. ""Enhanced support must be given to those facing the indirect impacts of restrictions and closures - in supply chains, tourist destinations and town and city centres."" Coronavirus drives shop closures to new record Row over Covid rules 'not just about Manchester' Make yourself a cuppa and get up to date with Covid rules The letter,externaloutlines a set of conditions firms would like to see in place before restrictions are imposed. It says there should be evidence of the effectiveness of the proposed measures, businesses should be given time to prepare, and financial support should be available, both for firms forced to closed, and those indirectly affected. While some businesses are required to close in areas under the strictest measures, many more firms say their business will be badly affected by a drop in demand as people are asked to limit some activities, travel and socialise less. Some businesses in England say they would rather be closed down under the tier three (very high alert) measures and receive financial support, than see demand for their services destroyed in a tier two (high) area, the BCC said. TEST AND TRACE:How does it work? THREE TIERS:How will the system work? SOCIAL DISTANCING:Can I give my friends a hug? TESTING:How do I get a virus test? The prime minister announced the new three tier system for England last week - pointing to sharply-rising transmission rates for the virus in some parts of the country. Mr Johnson told the House of Commons: ""This is not how we want to live our lives but this is the narrow path we have to tread between the social and economic trauma of a full lockdown and the massive human, and indeed, economic cost of an uncontained epidemic."" The government has introduced the toughest tier three restrictions in Liverpool and Lancashire, which means pubs and bars not serving food must close and households are not permitted to mix. Many other parts of England, including London, York and Essex, are now in tier two, the second highest level of measures. This means people from different households may not meet indoors including inside cafes and restaurants. In Northern Ireland, pubs, restaurants and cafes have closed to sit-in customers for the next four weeks, while in Scotland's central belt most licensed premises are closed under temporary restrictions. In Wales, a two-week ""fire break"" - a period with tighter restrictions to help break the trajectory of coronavirus cases rising - is expected within days. The BCC is also calling for changes to theNHS Test and Trace system. ""The need for additional restrictions cannot be blamed on a lack of care by hardworking people in businesses across the country,"" the letter said. ""Instead it represents a failure of the test and trace system, which must be urgently improved and expanded."" It suggests any period of enhanced restrictions should be used to speed up the effectiveness of NHS Test and Trace, including putting a focus on rapid testing and low-cost testing in workplaces. Cabinet minister Michael Gove told the BBC's Andrew Marr programme that the number of people being tested was higher than ever before and that ""contact-tracing was improving all the time"". But he said that ""any test and trace system has less utility as the virus grows"". Since the start of the pandemic, the number of people employed across the UK is down by around half a million, according to the Office for National Statistics, while some self-employed workers and entrepreneurs have lost significant amounts of work. The government provided support to employees and businesses at the start of lockdown in March, including VAT cuts, business rates holidays, extended loan schemes and the furlough scheme which provided 80% of wages for those unable to continue working. However, the furlough scheme is being phased out, and will be replaced at the end of this month by a less generousjob support scheme.

"A man removes debris in the Nagorno-Karabakh capital, Stepanakert Armenia and Azerbaijan have accused each other of violating a humanitarian ceasefire in the disputed region of Nagorno-Karabakh. Both sides agreed had agreed a truce to start at midnight local time (20:00 GMT Saturday). But an Armenian defence ministry spokeswoman said Azerbaijan broke the ceasefire after just four minutes by firing artillery shells and rockets. Azerbaijan later said Armenia had broken the truce after two minutes. Both countries signed a Russian-brokered ceasefire last Saturday. However, clashes continued despite that accord. Fighting flared last month over the territory, which is internationally recognised as part of Azerbaijan but run by ethnic Armenians. Hundreds have died. This is the worst violence in the region since a six-year war over the territory ended with a ceasefire in 1994. What are Armenia and Azerbaijan fighting over? Karabakh war leaves civilians shell-shocked and bitter Nagorno-Karabakh conflict in pictures Earlier on Saturday, both nations continued to trade accusations over violations of the Russian-brokered truce agreed last weekend and doubts are likely to remain following the latest statements. Both nations confirmed the humanitarian truce, although few other details were given. Azerbaijan's foreign ministry said the decision was based on statements by the presidents of the US, France and Russia, representing the OSCE Minsk Group - a body set up in 1992 and chaired by the three countries to mediate the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. Rescue workers at the scene of damage in the Azerbaijani city of Ganja Anna Naghdalyan, spokesperson for Armenia's foreign ministry carried the same statement in a tweet, adding it welcomed efforts towards a ""ceasefire and de-escalation of tension"" in the conflict zone. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, who negotiated last weekend's accord, spoke to counterparts in both countries on Saturday and said they needed to ""strictly follow"" the earlier agreement. French President Emmanuel Macron agreed, saying his country would pay ""close attention"" to the ceasefire. ""The enemy fired artillery shells in the northern direction from 00:04 to 02:45, (20:04 to 22:45 GMT Saturday) and fired rockets in the southern direction from 02:20 to 02:45,"" Armenian defence ministry spokeswoman Shushan Stepanyan said on Twitter. She later said that Azerbaijan launched an assault in the south of Nagorno-Karabakh on Sunday morning. ""There are casualties and wounded on both sides."" Speaking with the BBC, Armenia's Foreign Minister Zohrab Mnatsakanyan said his country was not responsible for breaking the ceasefire, and accused Azerbaijan of not being interested in a de-escalation. ""This has been exactly the policy of Azerbaijan... to exchange blame and to get the licence to continue the aggression,"" said Mr Mnatsakanyan. Meanwhile Hikmat Hajiyev, foreign policy chief in the presidency of Azerbaijan, blamed Armenia for the renewed fight. ""[Armenia is] misusing and misinterpreting the current ceasefire regime to reinforce their positions and to capture new territories of Azerbaijan,"" Mr Hajiyev told the BBC. ""Yesterday they ambushed a group of Azerbaijan armed forces and tried to kill them ""These are questions that the Armenian side needs to answer,"" he added. This video can not be played A ceasefire agreement last Saturday failed to stop the killing in Nagorno-Karabakh Azerbaijan accused Armenia of a missile strike in the early hours of Saturday that killed at least 13 civilians and injured 45 in Ganja, a city far from the front lines. An earlier statement by the foreign ministry accused Armenia of ""deliberate and indiscriminate targeting of civilians"". Armenian officials denied the attack, and accused Azerbaijan of attacking civilian areas.

"A record number of shops closed on UK high streets during the first half of this year as the coronavirus lockdown hit many stores hard, data shows. Some 11,120 chain store outlets shut between January and June, according to research by the Local Data Company and accountancy firm PwC. Although more than 5,000 shops opened during the same period it was not enough to fill the gaps, resulting in a net decline of 6,001 stores. The final total could even be higher. Researchers did not count outlets that had yet to reopen after the coronavirus lockdown ended. Many never will. The data includes shops, hospitality chains, and services such as post offices and banks, but it does not include small independent businesses. High streets were already experiencing upheaval long before the pandemic struck. Shops were closing at an average rate of 16 per day in 2019, according to the Local Data Company, which tracks vacancies rates. But the pandemic is turbo-charging change as more people shop online. The research found that York has been the worst affected area, with a net loss of 55 outlets. Harpenden, in Hertfordshire, meanwhile has fared better than any other location with a net increase in stores. High streets have borne the brunt of the closures. Retail parks have proved far more resilient. Standalone stores mean units which are out of town, but not in a retail park or shopping centre, for instance a large supermarket or an Ikea. The Local Data Company and PwC have been analysing the changes in the top 500 shopping locations for the past decade. This year's findings include all high streets, shopping centres and retail parks in Britain. They've reviewed existing data to allow comparisons with the previous five years. These new figures show the profound impact the pandemic is having on our town centres and high streets. ""For local authorities, it's now critical how they respond to this significant and growing decline in store occupants,"" says Lucy Stainton, head of retail and strategic partnerships at the Local Data Company. Whilst many city centres remain quiet, the pandemic has prompted something of a resurgence in local high streets with people increasingly wanting to shop locally if they're working from home. Lisa Hooker, consumer markets leader at PwC, says amid the turmoil, there continues to be a steady flow of openings:  ""With the continued roll out of value retailers, the boom in takeaways and pizza delivery shops and demand for services that can still only be delivered locally, such as tradesmen outlets, building products or locksmiths, shows that despite the stark numbers there remains a future for physical stores. ""It's likely that whatever happens retail will come out of this smaller and stronger,"" she believes. A thousand more shop workers' jobs to go More closures are still to come, however. Retailers and hospitality chains are continuing to restructure their businesses, cutting stores and many thousands of jobs to survive. Many have done deals with landlords to reduce rent bills, but billions of pounds of rent still remains unpaid thanks to the government ban on evictions to give struggling firms some breathing space, arrears which have only been postponed. Another key factor is business rates. Thanks to the government's rates holiday, retail and hospitality firms don't have to start paying this tax again till April next year. They say if it isn't extended, this could deal a final blow for the viability of many stores. Correction:an earlier version of the first graphic showed the worst performing cities in the wrong order.

"A tree-lined street in Camden, north London Urban areas are not all high-rise flats and offices, they are also where you'll find many of the country's trees.Â Two London boroughs - Camden and Croydon - were among the top 20 places in England and Wales with the most tree cover, a research project has found. Meanwhile largely rural areas had some of the least - including part of the Lake District and the Yorkshire Dales.Â Garden trees are boosting numbers in towns, while farming helps explain some of the low rural rankings. Bluesky International, an aerial survey company who carried out the work with the help of mapping specialist Esri UK, say they have detected around 400 million trees so far - but there are still more to find. Â In Camden and CroydonÂ almost a third of the borough is covered in trees.Â Croydon has several areas of woodland and Camden includes Hampstead Heath and Primrose Hill. But when the data is mapped you can see the distinct pattern of tree lined streets and trees in gardens that help push up the percentage.Â Surrey Heath has the largest percentage of trees. But the area ""has seen quite a recent transformation,"" John Tucker from the Woodland Trust says. ""If you look back 60, 80, 100 years a lot of this area was open heathland and would have been managed and grazed.""Â But as livestock farming became less economical the area has returned to woodland.Â The place with the lowest tree cover is South Holland - an area of mainly farmland on The Wash in Lincolnshire.Â It is closely followed by neighbouring Boston.Â  Â This part of the east coast, all the way to East Yorkshire, features in the bottom 20 areas.Â ""These areas were swept of trees for farming and have never recovered,"" says Dr Paul Brindley,Â an expert in trees and planning at Sheffield University's Department of Landscape Architecture. A treeless landscape in South Holland, Lincolnshire But perhaps more surprising are that areas in the bottom 20 include parts of the Yorkshire Dales National Park and an area of the Lake District.Â Richmondshire and Craven between them cover a large part of the Yorkshire Dales but have only 6% tree cover. Eden, an area that includes Ullswater and parts of the North Pennine area of outstanding national beauty has just 7%.Â â¨ After the ice-age this area would have been 80-90% trees according to Peter Leeson from the Woodland Trust.Â But the demand for wood over history has meant trees have been felled and used for everything from wood fuel to building mines.Â Many areas have also been cleared to make way for fields for animals to graze and sheep can have a secondary effect of eating new trees before they get a chance to establish.Â View over the north Pennines Dr Brindley says it is important to know where the trees are because it can help assess their impact.Â ""It's not just like there's one thing they're providing benefits for - there are a wide range of benefits."" Studies show green spaces and trees in particular can help improve people's health and wellbeing as well as helpingÂ with bio-diversity. Bees in particular like trees. They also play an important role in cooling our urban areas which often generate more heat than the surrounding rural areas because of the number of buildings, people and vehicles. Cllr Adam Harrison, cabinet member on Camden Council believes trees play an important role in the wellbeing of people in his borough. ""They can improve air and water quality, reduce noise pollution, support wildlife and are fantastic for improving mental and physical health"" he says. The data shows which areas benefit from having trees in gardens like this area in Sheffield Surrey Heath Waverley Bracknell Forest Runnymede Woking Mole Valley Elmbridge Guildford Neath Port Talbot New Forest Mid Sussex Rushmoor Hart South Bucks Reigate and Banstead Camden Cannock Chase Croydon Chichester Epsom and Ewell Tunbridge Wells South Holland Boston Fenland Barrow-in-Furness City of London Thanet East Riding of Yorkshire East Cambridgeshire Craven North Kesteven East Lindsey Richmondshire Hartlepool Fylde Isle of Anglesey North Lincolnshire Rochford North East Lincolnshire Eden Rossendale The trees have been detected using machine learning. Bluesky International combine their own high resolution aerial photographs, terrain maps and surface maps.Â Using these three data sources and a machine learning algorithm they can work out which objects are trees and which are not. From this they create their National Tree Map which has been mapped by Esri UK.

"This video can not be played Andy Burnham: ""This is not just Greater Manchester's fight"" Greater Manchester's mayor has called on Boris Johnson for help in ""breaking the impasse"" over stricter Covid-19 curbs in the region. Andy Burnham said in a letter to the PM and other party leaders that Parliament should hold an urgent debate to end the deadlock. Later the mayor said he had a ""constructive call"" with Mr Johnson's chief strategic adviser. Earlier, minister Michael Gove said: ""We hope to agree a new approach."" Mr Gove said the government wanted the best for Greater Manchester and that he hoped ""we can find a way through together"". But he criticised what he described as the ""incoherence"" of politicians in that region and warned that if an agreement could not be reached the government would ""look at"" having to impose restrictions. Leaders in Greater Manchester, including Mr Burnham, have rejected a move to England's tier three alert level without better financial support. Prime Minister Boris Johnsonhas said he may ""need to intervene""if local leaders do not accept a move to tier three curbs. A further 16,982 people tested positive for the virus as of Sunday, the Department of Health figures showed, with a further 67 deaths occurring within 28 days of a positive test. Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon tweeted that the figure for positive Covid cases in Scotland should be ""treated with some caution"" due to ""a delay within the UK lab system"". Cases rose by 316 in Scotland with no further deaths recorded. The UK government said there was no capacity issue at a Lighthouse laboratory in Glasgow and that rerouting of tests to other laboratories was routine practice. Mr Burnham has said he would be ""ready to speak to the prime minister at any time"" to discuss the situation. The mayor's spokesman confirmed Mr Burnham had spoken to Sir Edward Lister, a No 10 official, in a phone call on Sunday afternoon. What Covid tier is my area in? Tier system: The street split down the middle Tory MPs clash over Manchester restrictions In the letter, Mr Burnham said the prospect of tier three - very high - restrictions on hospitality and other areas ""is not just a Greater Manchester issue"". He wrote: ""Establishing clear national entitlements of the kind we had during the first lockdown will create a sense of fairness which in turn would help build public support for, and compliance with, any new restrictions."" ""As leaders of the main political parties in Westminster, I urge you to work together to help resolve this current dispute and establish a fair financial framework for local lockdowns that the whole country will be able to support,"" he added. In the language of negotiation, it seems the government and mayor of Greater Manchester may have stepped back from the brink. Both sides softened their tone in interviews this morning, there was talk of ending the war of words and finding a new way through. But it's important to remember this is not just a two-way row. The most telling intervention of the last 24 hours has not been from Andy Burnham or Michael Gove, but the senior Conservative MP Sir Graham Brady. He represents a constituency in the region and says MPs, council leaders and mayor are ""united"" across party lines in resisting tier 3 restrictions. So, while the argument plays out in public between the government and Mr Burnham, it may be won or lost in private between ministers and their own backbenchers whose support is crucial to the government's approach. Earlier, Mr Burnham told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show there had been ""exaggeration"" by the prime minister of rising case numbers in Greater Manchester. Mr Johnson said on Friday cases in the region had doubled over the previous nine days. Mr Burnham said that while cases were ""up slightly"" they were ""certainly not doubling every nine days"". Sir Graham Brady, a senior backbench Conservative and MP for Altrincham and Sale West in Greater Manchester, described the region's Labour and Tory MPs as ""pretty united"" and said positive tests were ""flattening"". The latest data on infection rates in the city of Manchester itself show they have fallen slightly, to around 458 cases per 100,000 of the population. Across Greater Manchester as a whole - which includes another nine boroughs including Salford, Stockport and Bury - the infection rate is slightly up. So it is a mixed picture, but the region as a whole is still a long way off other areas such as Derry, Nottingham and Liverpool. But in many ways it is not the infection rate that matters. What counts are the number of people who are falling so seriously ill they end up in hospital. We know that lots of otherwise fit and healthy students falling ill with Covid-19 is not going to have a significant impact on the local health service, but lots of older people falling ill would change the picture quickly. Last week it was reported that, in Liverpool, around 95% of intensive care beds were occupied. But Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham told the BBC on Sunday morning there were only 64 occupied beds in the city region. Across Greater Manchester, leaders accept there is a serious problem. But they question whether it is serious enough to warrant the kind of economic impact - not to mention the effect on people's mental health - that moving to tier three - very high - would have. Mr Burnham also described ""side deals"" with councils in regions moving into tier three - very high - as not ""good enough for me"". Liverpool City Region's metro mayor Steve Rotherhamannounced,externalhis area will receive an additional Â£44m and a similar package worth Â£42mwas given to local leaders in Lancashire. ""Let's remember, the places they're trying to close in tier three - pubs, bookies, gyms - these are places where people are on low wages. And what we're saying is you cannot take away their place of work and not give them support,"" Mr Burnham said. He called on the government to re-introduce the 80% furlough scheme used previously in the pandemic to support the low paid affected by tier three closures. Currently,a less generous schemeto provide two-thirds of wages is on offer. Make yourself a cuppa and get up to date with Covid rules What is a circuit-breaker? The rules in your area The Labour mayor added: ""The truth is health, protecting health, is about more than controlling the virus."" TEST AND TRACE:How does it work? THREE TIERS:How will the system work? SOCIAL DISTANCING:Can I give my friends a hug? TESTING:How do I get a virus test? A letterfrom Tory MPs representing areas on the lowest tier of England's Covid alert systemcalled on Mr Burnham to accept a move to tier three - very high - rather than allow national restrictions througha so-called ""circuit-breaker"". ""It does not make sense to shut down the whole country when the virus is spiking in particular locations,"" it said. But four Conservative MPs representing seats in Greater Manchester hit back, describing the letter as ""deeply disappointing... unnecessary and ill-advised"", ""neither wanted nor helpful"" and a ""No 10 approved communication"". And Mr Burnham said: ""I'm not sure a sort of 'we're alright, Jack' letter from a group of southern Conservative MPs is going to cut much ice [in Greater Manchester]."" Meanwhile, Prof Jeremy Farrar, a scientific adviser to the government, said Christmas will be ""tough"" this year with traditional family celebrations unlikely. ""Christmas will be tough this year. I don't think it's going to be the usual celebration it is and all families coming together, I'm afraid,"" he told Sky News. ""I think we have to be honest and realistic and say that we are in for three to six months of a very, very difficult period."" But the Wellcome Trust director said there is ""light at the end of the tunnel"", as he believes a Covid-19 vaccine and effective treatment will be ready in the first quarter of 2021.

"Welsh Government ministers are meeting again on Sunday to discuss a 'fire-break' national lockdown Officials are ""not blind"" to the impact another national lockdown would have on the economy, Wales' health minister has said. Vaughan Gething said the concern being voiced ""weighs heavily"" on ministers. A decision on a two or three-week ""fire-break"" lockdown is expected on Monday. However, Conservative leader in the Senedd Paul Davies said he would not support the measure ""until I know what the details are"". Mr Gething told BBC Politics Waleshe recognised a circuit-breaker lockdown to slow the infection rates would have real impacts ""in terms of people being able to pay their bills"". ""We're also not blind to the fact that doing nothing means that Covid will continue to grow and we will continue to see harm,"" he added. ""We want to be able to get to the end of the year with a pattern that people can live with. ""What we can't do though is give people a guarantee that things will not happen during the winter. That depends on all the choices that we make."" The Welsh Government cabinet met on Sunday afternoon to continue its discussions, and agreed to meet again on Monday ahead of the expected announcement from First Minister Mark Drakeford. A Welsh Government spokesperson said: ""Ministers have held a number of meetings over the weekend with senior Welsh Government officials, scientists and public health experts to consider their advice on a potential need for a 'fire break' set of measures to control the virus. ""The Welsh cabinet met this evening to consider that advice. The cabinet will meet again tomorrow morning to make a final decision. The first minister will update the people of Wales on any decisions taken tomorrow."" Seventeen areas in Wales currently have local lockdown rules in place Prior to the cabinet meeting, Mr Gething insisted no final decision had been taken on lockdown measures. It follows the publication of a letter on possible dates for a short, Wales-wide lockdown. It prompted calls from the Welsh Conservatives for an emergency recall of the Senedd on Monday. ""They should come now to the Senedd tomorrow to make a statement to explain that (letter), and also to explain what their plans are, because it's unacceptable that they are actually briefing organisations and the media,"" said Mr Davies. ""They should be making the decisions and making the announcements in the Senedd, that's the point we're making."" The letter was sent to all Confederation of Passenger Transport members by the Welsh director In the letter to members of the Confederation of Passenger Transport, Wales director John Pockett said lockdown would start at 18:00 on 23 October and end on 9 November. But Mr Pockett has since told PA Media he was assuming what would happen. ""The letter is genuine and it contains what I assume or surmised would be the position,"" he said. ""It was me advising my bus operator members to be prepared for something and this is what it may well be. ""It could be more - it could be anything. I think other associations have communicated with their members in the same way."" 'Clear guidance needed' as lockdown talks continue Figuring out the stats on coronavirus in Wales 'Dark days' for tourism but with 'silver linings' How many people have died with Covid in Wales? The speculation over the possible lockdown has led to ""frustration"", said one of Wales' police and crime commissioners. Dyfed-Powys Police and Crime Commissioner Dafydd Llywelyn told BBC Radio Wales'Sunday Supplement: ""We have had meetings last week in relation to the preparation for what may be happening in the future. ""The reality, and I will be very open about this, the detail of that has not necessarily been shared in a huge amount with us and there is sometimes - and has been during the whole period - some frustration on the part of policing."" This video can not be played The BBC's Laura Foster explains what a circuit breaker is and how it could help tackle Covid-19 Plaid CymruMember of the SeneddSian Gwenllian said the Welsh Government ""must urgently set out its plans for a national fire-break"". ""We are concerned about the lack of clarity and anxiety caused by a drip-feed of information circulating in the media and elsewhere over the weekend,"" she added. Baroness Wilcox, the former head of the Welsh Local Government Association, said there was a ""growing consensus that we need a different set of measures"". ""We need different actions to respond to the virus,"" she said. The Welsh Government said: ""The measures we have put in place at both a local and a national level, with help from the public, have kept the spread of the virus under check. ""However, there is a growing consensus that we now need to introduce a different set of measures and actions to respond to the virus as it is spreading across Wales more quickly through the autumn and winter. ""We are actively considering advice from SAGE and our TAC Group. ""A 'fire-break' set of measures to control Covid-19, similar to that described in the SAGE papers, is under consideration in Wales.

"This video can not be played Michael Gove: ""We hope the EU will change their position"" The door is ""still ajar"" for talks with the EU over a post-Brexit trade deal but only if it moves ground in key areas, Michael Gove has said. He said the EU must speed up the negotiations and offer better terms. It comes as the EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier will not travel to London for talks tomorrow but will join ""remotely, as planned"", his team said. Negotiations between the UK and the EU have stalled amid disagreements over fishing access and competition issues. The EU has said it is prepared to ""intensify"" talks but it would not agree a deal at ""any price"". The CBI and other business organisations urged the UK government to focus on bridging its differences with the EU, saying a deal was vital to help the post-Covid recovery. They warned that uncertainty about the UK's future trading relationship with its largest market was ""chipping away at business resilience"" at a time when many firms were being battered by coronavirus. UK's trade talks with EU are over, says No 10 What are the sticking points in Brexit trade talks? What is the 'no-deal' Australia option? Downing Street said on Friday that official negotiations over a future economic partnership were ""over"" and the UK should ""get ready"" to trade with the EU from 1 January without a specific agreement. Boris Johnson has accused the EU of resisting the UK's preferred outcome of a deal based onthe one the bloc has with Canada. The prime minister has said the UK should now be prepared for the alternative of a much more limited relationship, based on the EU's existing arrangements with Australia. However, this would see tariffs applied on goods crossing the channel once the UK leaves the EU's single market at the end of the year, pushing up the cost of imports and exports. The EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, was due in London for talks with his counterpart, David Frost, on Monday, but the UK said this would be pointless without a fundamental change in direction from the bloc. Senior EU sources had indicated on Friday that Mr Barnier would be attending in person. But it is now expected that he will hold a video conference call with Lord Frost to discuss the structure of any future talks. Mr Gove told the BBC's Andrew Marr that the EU ""effectively ended the current round of talks"" when its 27 leaders met in Brussels on Thursday to take stock of progress and said more was required from the UK. ""It was the case we were making progress but then the EU retreated from that,"" he said. ""We have drawn the conclusion that unless their approach changes, they are not interested and they have in effect drawn stumps."" Michael Gove said the EU ""effectively ended the current round of talks"" in Brussels Mr Johnson previously indicated that the UK would walk away from the talks unless EU leaders agreed an outline deal at last week's summit in Brussels. Asked by Andrew Marr whether the UK was engaging in sabre-rattling or the door was still ajar to further discussions, Mr Gove replied: ""It is still ajar. We hope the EU will change their position and we are certainly not saying if they do change their position we can't talk to them."" Mr Gove said the UK was preparing for a range of outcomes, including leaving on what he described as ""Australian terms"", which would see trade between the two partners default to World Trade Organization rules. ""That is not going to be a picnic,"" he said on this scenario. ""The key thing is we are taking the steps alongside business to be ready for that outcome."" This video can not be played ""We've left, now we need to decide some important trade aspects"": Michael Gove says UK still holds cards for negotiations And he said he was ""not embarrassed"" by comments he made during the 2016 EU referendum campaign, when he was a key figure in the Vote Leave campaign, when he claimed that reaching a trade deal would ""not be any more complicated or onerous than the day-to-day work"" of the UK's diplomats. He said the remarks, and comments in a March 2019 newspaper interview in which he said the British public did not vote for Brexit in order to leave without a deal, should be placed ""in context"", given the UK had since negotiated a withdrawal agreement and left the EU. Businesses have warned that a failure to reach a deal will accentuate the damage done by the Covid pandemic. Trade bodies representing 190,000 firms have written to Mr Gove urging him to reach an agreement. ""With each day that passes, business resilience is chipped away,"" the CBI and other groups said. ""A swift deal is the single most effective way to support recovery in communities across Europe. ""After four years of debate, there must be a resolution. 2021 can then be a year to rebuild, rather than regret.""

"For the second time this year, gyms in England are closing their doors. Some areas such as Liverpool had already turned off their treadmills, but now the rest of the country is following suit. It's after the government announced a second national lockdown, which means pubs, restaurants, non-essential shops and places of worship will also be closing on 5 November. But what's the science behind shutting gyms? Are they riskier than shopping or going to a restaurant? And what will it mean for the mental health of gym users? ""It's very difficult to know for sure where people get their virus,"" according to Professor Jonathan Ball, who's a virologist at the University of Nottingham. He says gyms are closing because the government is trying to react to the high number of coronavirus cases. ""When you've got such huge numbers of cases in the community, particularly in people who are young and healthy, they may not experience any symptoms at all. ""There's always a risk that you might interact with someone who's infected [without either of you knowing] and that allows the virus to transmit."" Gyms might not be as high risk as hospitals or care homes but Prof Ball tells Newsbeat: ""You do tend to exercise quite vigorously, that means that you can breathe rapidly and quite deeply. ""Therefore, we'd expect that you could potentially produce droplets or aerosols that could go on to infect other people."" He also points out there are lots of areas of gyms that people touch, like handles and equipment, before touching their faces. There is a big ""but"" though. Prof Ball says a lot of that risk can be dramatically lowered through things like effective air-conditioning, regular cleaning, social distancing and hand sanitising. ""From the data that I've seen from Public Health England, I'm not aware that there is a significant hotspot for infections in the gym environment. ""We know where the major risks are but after that we know there are other activities where people mix and where people mix, there is a chance of transmission occurring."" The only government data on gyms comes from Public Health England's surveillance report, which isbased on data from Test and Trace,external. That data puts gyms on 2.8%, while supermarkets are 11.2%, pubs and bars are 7.4% and secondary schools are 6.8%. What those percentages mean is a bit tricky - here's where they come from. In the week to 25 October, 107,046 people who had tested positive for coronavirus were referred for contact tracing. Of those, 33,233 had been somewhere in the previous seven days that at least one other person contacted had visited. About 930 of those said they had been to the gym - that's 2.8% of all the common locations reported. We don't know if they caught it at the gym - we just know they visited the gym. Is that a lot? It's hard to tell - you need to take into account how many people visit a gym regularly compared with, for example, a supermarket. The point is that for the latest week, gyms came sixth on the list of common locations, ahead of people attending universities, people working in care homes and people going shopping for clothes. And the government is bound to have noticed that. Its scientific advisory group Sage estimated in September that closing indoor gyms and leisure centrescould potentially reduce the R number (that's the average number of people each infected person infects) by 0.1,external, but stressed that estimating that was ""very difficult"". Trainer Nathan Penman spoke to Newsbeat just before his gym closed in Liverpool in mid-October. Gyms in the Liverpool City Region closed earlier than the rets of the country, when the region went into tier three - the highest Covid alert level. ""It's just a bizarre feeling in the gym. It's the same kind of consensus among everybody there."" Nathan at one of his final spin classes before gyms in Liverpool closed As well as working in a gym, Nathan says exercising is hugely important for his physical and mental health. ""Health and fitness, physically and mentally should be a priority for the nation at the minute. ""So for the government to turn around and say that gyms are not important - I think it's giving off a ridiculous message."" Nathan says people in the gyms he trains in have followed the rules. But 29-year-old Jack Occleshaw, from Nottingham, isn't as confident. ""You could tell that staff at the gym had put in all the measures to make you feel comfortable and were taking the situation seriously,"" he says. ""But it was more the actual members that were not keeping up."" Jack from Nottingham has become more nervous about using the gym Jack was frustrated by members not wiping down equipment after use and thinks staff should have enforced the rules more strictly. ""I also tend to swim to help with mental health and clear my head. ""In our gym you have to book a slot. But you'd see people walk past the pool and say 'I reckon I could fit in there'."" Jack's concerns about people not following advice meant he was put off from using the gym. But this is no longer a choice he, or other gym users, will have. As you'd expect, gyms aren't happy about being forced to close, with Anytime Fitness among those calling on the government to review its decision. The chain says the announcement is ""difficult to take"" given people have been using gyms for the last four months. It adds that if the government goes ahead with plans to shut gyms and leisure centres, then ""comprehensive financial support will be needed.""

"A group of Tory MPs have urged Greater Manchester's mayor to ""engage"" with the government's regional approach to restrictions - prompting anger from some of their own colleagues. In a letter to Andy Burnham and Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer, 20 MPs said a national lockdown would impose ""severe costs"" on areas with low transmission. But four Conservative MPs for the region said the letter was unhelpful. Ministers say Greater Manchester needs to be in the top tier of restrictions. Did we ever 'follow the science'? Confusion over fresh talks in Manchester Covid row PM warns he may 'need to intervene' on Manchester The letter was organised by Jerome Mayhew, MP for Broadland in Norfolk, and was signed by MPs representing constituencies currently at the lowest tier of Covid restrictions. ""It does not make sense to shut down the whole country when the virus is spiking in particular locations,"" the letter reads. ""Our constituents, like yours, have made many sacrifices to get - and keep - the virus under control in our areas,"" it adds. Meanwhile, Liverpool City Region's metro mayor Steve Rotherhamannounced,externalhis area will receive an additional Â£44m from the government to ""support local jobs and businesses"" and fund a local test-and-trace service after its move to tier three - very high.

"This video can not be played Michael Gove: ""We hope the EU will change their position"" The door is ""still ajar"" for talks with the EU over a post-Brexit trade deal but only if it moves ground in key areas, Michael Gove has said. He said the EU must speed up the negotiations and offer better terms. It comes as the EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier will not travel to London for talks tomorrow but will join ""remotely, as planned"", his team said. Negotiations between the UK and the EU have stalled amid disagreements over fishing access and competition issues. The EU has said it is prepared to ""intensify"" talks but it would not agree a deal at ""any price"". The CBI and other business organisations urged the UK government to focus on bridging its differences with the EU, saying a deal was vital to help the post-Covid recovery. They warned that uncertainty about the UK's future trading relationship with its largest market was ""chipping away at business resilience"" at a time when many firms were being battered by coronavirus. UK's trade talks with EU are over, says No 10 What are the sticking points in Brexit trade talks? What is the 'no-deal' Australia option? Downing Street said on Friday that official negotiations over a future economic partnership were ""over"" and the UK should ""get ready"" to trade with the EU from 1 January without a specific agreement. Boris Johnson has accused the EU of resisting the UK's preferred outcome of a deal based onthe one the bloc has with Canada. The prime minister has said the UK should now be prepared for the alternative of a much more limited relationship, based on the EU's existing arrangements with Australia. However, this would see tariffs applied on goods crossing the channel once the UK leaves the EU's single market at the end of the year, pushing up the cost of imports and exports. The EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, was due in London for talks with his counterpart, David Frost, on Monday, but the UK said this would be pointless without a fundamental change in direction from the bloc. Senior EU sources had indicated on Friday that Mr Barnier would be attending in person. But it is now expected that he will hold a video conference call with Lord Frost to discuss the structure of any future talks. Mr Gove told the BBC's Andrew Marr that the EU ""effectively ended the current round of talks"" when its 27 leaders met in Brussels on Thursday to take stock of progress and said more was required from the UK. ""It was the case we were making progress but then the EU retreated from that,"" he said. ""We have drawn the conclusion that unless their approach changes, they are not interested and they have in effect drawn stumps."" Michael Gove said the EU ""effectively ended the current round of talks"" in Brussels Mr Johnson previously indicated that the UK would walk away from the talks unless EU leaders agreed an outline deal at last week's summit in Brussels. Asked by Andrew Marr whether the UK was engaging in sabre-rattling or the door was still ajar to further discussions, Mr Gove replied: ""It is still ajar. We hope the EU will change their position and we are certainly not saying if they do change their position we can't talk to them."" Mr Gove said the UK was preparing for a range of outcomes, including leaving on what he described as ""Australian terms"", which would see trade between the two partners default to World Trade Organization rules. ""That is not going to be a picnic,"" he said on this scenario. ""The key thing is we are taking the steps alongside business to be ready for that outcome."" This video can not be played ""We've left, now we need to decide some important trade aspects"": Michael Gove says UK still holds cards for negotiations And he said he was ""not embarrassed"" by comments he made during the 2016 EU referendum campaign, when he was a key figure in the Vote Leave campaign, when he claimed that reaching a trade deal would ""not be any more complicated or onerous than the day-to-day work"" of the UK's diplomats. He said the remarks, and comments in a March 2019 newspaper interview in which he said the British public did not vote for Brexit in order to leave without a deal, should be placed ""in context"", given the UK had since negotiated a withdrawal agreement and left the EU. Businesses have warned that a failure to reach a deal will accentuate the damage done by the Covid pandemic. Trade bodies representing 190,000 firms have written to Mr Gove urging him to reach an agreement. ""With each day that passes, business resilience is chipped away,"" the CBI and other groups said. ""A swift deal is the single most effective way to support recovery in communities across Europe. ""After four years of debate, there must be a resolution. 2021 can then be a year to rebuild, rather than regret.""

"Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Sunday. We'll have another update for you on Monday. People who have been told to self-isolate through NHS Test and Tracecould have their details shared with the policeon a ""case-by-case basis"", the Department of Health and Social Care has said. The British Medical Association has raised concerns that police involvement might put people off being tested. Some 20 Tory MPs have written urging Greater Manchester's mayor to ""engage"" with the government's regional approach to restrictions -prompting anger from some of their own colleagues, who said the intervention was ""not helpful"". Some of those calling for a more national response have accused ministers of not listening to scientific advice butwhat does it really mean to ""follow the science"",and did we ever do it? Arecord number of shops closedon UK high streets during the first half of this year, data shows. Researchers found that 11,120 chain store outlets shut between January and June. Although more than 5,000 shops opened during this period, it was not enough to fill the gaps, resulting in a net decline of 6,001 stores.

"Most people in England and Scotland can no longer get free PCR or lateral flow tests (LFTs).

"The Scottish government has called on the Treasury to exempt the new self-isolation payment from tax. Social security secretary Shirley-Anne Somerville has written to Chancellor Rishi Sunak saying people may not apply for the Â£500 because of tax concerns. Applications for the payment, intended to help those on low incomes who are Covid-positive, opened this week. The Treasury has said tax arrangements throughout the UK will be ""fair to everyone"". In Scotland, the payments will be made through the Scottish Welfare Fund and administered by local authorities. Initially, the money will go to those on Universal Credit or similar benefits. Ms Somerville said: ""I welcome your consideration of an exemption from National Insurance contributions (NICs) and I believe a similar approach should be taken in respect of income tax. ""Subjecting these payments to tax risks detracting from the important public health measures they are intended to support. ""In a worst case scenario, the prospect of a future tax liability may prevent a person from applying, leading to them having to make the difficult choice between self-isolating and returning to work so they can support themselves financially."" She added: ""I would ask that you consider an income tax exemption in respect of payments made under the self-isolation support grant scheme, similar to the exemption you have put in place for NICs and the test and trace support payment scheme in England."" A Treasury spokeswoman said: ""We have treated the Scottish government scheme exactly the same as we have similar schemes in the rest of the UK by making it subject to income tax but also exempting it from National Insurance Contributions. That's fair to everyone. ""We have also ensured that it has no detrimental impact when calculating Universal Credit and tax credits so that no-one receiving these payments will see their welfare payments reduced.""

"A man removes debris in the Nagorno-Karabakh capital, Stepanakert Armenia and Azerbaijan have accused each other of violating a humanitarian ceasefire in the disputed region of Nagorno-Karabakh. Both sides agreed had agreed a truce to start at midnight local time (20:00 GMT Saturday). But an Armenian defence ministry spokeswoman said Azerbaijan broke the ceasefire after just four minutes by firing artillery shells and rockets. Azerbaijan later said Armenia had broken the truce after two minutes. Both countries signed a Russian-brokered ceasefire last Saturday. However, clashes continued despite that accord. Fighting flared last month over the territory, which is internationally recognised as part of Azerbaijan but run by ethnic Armenians. Hundreds have died. This is the worst violence in the region since a six-year war over the territory ended with a ceasefire in 1994. What are Armenia and Azerbaijan fighting over? Karabakh war leaves civilians shell-shocked and bitter Nagorno-Karabakh conflict in pictures Earlier on Saturday, both nations continued to trade accusations over violations of the Russian-brokered truce agreed last weekend and doubts are likely to remain following the latest statements. Both nations confirmed the humanitarian truce, although few other details were given. Azerbaijan's foreign ministry said the decision was based on statements by the presidents of the US, France and Russia, representing the OSCE Minsk Group - a body set up in 1992 and chaired by the three countries to mediate the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. Rescue workers at the scene of damage in the Azerbaijani city of Ganja Anna Naghdalyan, spokesperson for Armenia's foreign ministry carried the same statement in a tweet, adding it welcomed efforts towards a ""ceasefire and de-escalation of tension"" in the conflict zone. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, who negotiated last weekend's accord, spoke to counterparts in both countries on Saturday and said they needed to ""strictly follow"" the earlier agreement. French President Emmanuel Macron agreed, saying his country would pay ""close attention"" to the ceasefire. ""The enemy fired artillery shells in the northern direction from 00:04 to 02:45, (20:04 to 22:45 GMT Saturday) and fired rockets in the southern direction from 02:20 to 02:45,"" Armenian defence ministry spokeswoman Shushan Stepanyan said on Twitter. She later said that Azerbaijan launched an assault in the south of Nagorno-Karabakh on Sunday morning. ""There are casualties and wounded on both sides."" Speaking with the BBC, Armenia's Foreign Minister Zohrab Mnatsakanyan said his country was not responsible for breaking the ceasefire, and accused Azerbaijan of not being interested in a de-escalation. ""This has been exactly the policy of Azerbaijan... to exchange blame and to get the licence to continue the aggression,"" said Mr Mnatsakanyan. Meanwhile Hikmat Hajiyev, foreign policy chief in the presidency of Azerbaijan, blamed Armenia for the renewed fight. ""[Armenia is] misusing and misinterpreting the current ceasefire regime to reinforce their positions and to capture new territories of Azerbaijan,"" Mr Hajiyev told the BBC. ""Yesterday they ambushed a group of Azerbaijan armed forces and tried to kill them ""These are questions that the Armenian side needs to answer,"" he added. This video can not be played A ceasefire agreement last Saturday failed to stop the killing in Nagorno-Karabakh Azerbaijan accused Armenia of a missile strike in the early hours of Saturday that killed at least 13 civilians and injured 45 in Ganja, a city far from the front lines. An earlier statement by the foreign ministry accused Armenia of ""deliberate and indiscriminate targeting of civilians"". Armenian officials denied the attack, and accused Azerbaijan of attacking civilian areas. Ms Stepanyan posted a video on Facebook, which she said showed devastation in the Nagorno-Karabakh region, accusing the Azerbaijani Armed Forces of striking at civilians with missiles in areas including the Nagorno-Karabakh capital, Stepanakert.
