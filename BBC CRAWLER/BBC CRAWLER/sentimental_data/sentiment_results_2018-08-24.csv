"This video can not be played Alex Salmond: 'I have not sexually harassed anyone' Two people have made complaints against former first minister Alex Salmond, who denies ever sexually harassing anyone. His successor, Nicola Sturgeon, said the complaints were made in January and were investigated through a process she had agreed to. She said the situation was ""difficult for me to come to terms with"" given her long history with Mr Salmond, but claims ""could not be ignored"". Mr Salmond told BBC Scotland he was ""no saint"" and has ""got flaws"". He added: ""I have made many mistakes in my life, political and personal. ""But I have not sexually harassed anyone and I certainly have not been engaged in criminality."" What do we know about the allegations facing Mr Salmond? Alex Salmond profile He also insisted that a new complaints procedure introduced by the Scottish government last year following wider concerns about harassment at Holyrood and Westminster was ""unfair and unjust"". Police Scotland has confirmed that it is ""carrying out an assessment of information which we have received and inquiries are at an early stage"". The Daily Record, whichbroke the story on Thursday night,external, says the allegations date back to December 2013, and that Mr Salmond has been reported to police over claims he sexually assaulted two staff members at the first minister's official residence at Bute House in Edinburgh. This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon: 'This is an incredibly difficult situation' In a BBC Scotland interview, Ms Sturgeon did not give any further details of the allegations or the outcome of the government investigation. She also said she was ""acutely aware how upsetting this will be"" for her party, but stressed that ""complaints could not be ignored or swept under the carpet"". Ms Sturgeon revealed that she first heard about the investigation from Mr Salmond in April and had no prior knowledge of complaints being made against him. Asked if Mr Salmond was still a member of the SNP, the first minister said: ""These matters will be considered in the fullness of time"". Nicola Sturgeon acted as Mr Salmond's deputy for many years before succeeding him as first minister and SNP leader in 2014 Mr Salmond has dropped legal action aimed at preventing the Scottish government revealing details of its investigation, but has asked the Court of Session in Edinburgh to review the government's handling of the complaints process. He argues that new procedures introduced last year following wider concerns about sexual harassment at Holyrood and Westminster were ""unfair and unjust"". The Scottish government claimed a statement released by Mr Salmond contained ""significant errors"", with Ms Sturgeon saying it would ""defend its position vigorously"". Allow Twitter content?

Mr Salmond, who had two spells as leader of the pro-independence SNP, led the devolved Scottish government as first minister from 2007. He quit in the aftermath of the independence referendum in 2014, when Scotland voted to remain in the United Kingdom. This is the last thing that the SNP wanted. Nicola Sturgeon's gloomy demeanour during the interview rather said it all. It affects her directly in three ways. First of all it affects her governmentally because she is the political head of the government and she instigated this very policy of zero tolerance of sexual misconduct. Secondly, it affects her politically because she is the leader of the SNP and depending on how it develops, depending on the outcome, this is scarcely potentially good news for the party. And thirdly, it affects the first minister personally. She is a personal friend of Alex Salmond. He was her mentor, he was her predecessor as first minister. Ms Sturgeon confirmed: ""Complaints were made in January relating to Alex Salmond by two individuals. ""These complaints have been considered since then under a procedure covering ministers and former ministers that was agreed by me in December 2017 in the wake of public concern about harassment. ""Although I have been aware for some time of the fact of the investigation - initially from Alex Salmond - I have had no role in the process, and to have referred to it before now would have compromised the integrity of the internal investigation, which I was not prepared to do."" Ms Sturgeon said she had been told by the Scottish government's top civil servant, Leslie Evans, earlier this week that she had completed her investigation and that she intended to make the complaints public. The first minister added: ""Alex Salmond is now challenging the Scottish government's procedure in court. The Scottish government refutes his criticisms of its process and will defend its position vigorously. ""I have been clear on many occasions that all organisations and workplaces must make it possible for people to come forward to report concerns and have confidence that they will be treated seriously. ""For that principle to mean anything it cannot be applied selectively. It must be applied without fear or favour, regardless of the identity, seniority or political allegiance of the person involved."" Mr Salmond has hosted a show on the controversial RT station since last November Leader of Scottish National Party 1990-2000 and 2004-2014 First Minister of Scotland 2007 - 2014 Stood down after Scotland voted to remain in the United Kingdom In a statement released on Thursday night, Mr Salmond strongly denied all of the allegations against him. He did not say what the claims were, but described some of them as being ""patently ridiculous"". He also said that ""on the advice of Senior Counsel"" he had been complaining to Mrs Evans, the Scottish government's permanent secretary, that the complaints procedure was ""unjust"" and ""unlawful"". The permanent secretary isresponsible for the Scottish government's 5,000 civil servants,external, and is the principal policy advisor to Ms Sturgeon. Mr Salmond said that ""with great reluctance"" he had now launched a judicial review against the Scottish government at the Court of Session. He said that if he lost the case he would have to answer to the complaints against him ""both comprehensively and publicly"". But he warned that ""the administration at the senior levels of the Scottish government will have the most serious questions to answer"" if the court finds in his favour. Mr Salmond said: ""Even now I have not been allowed to see and therefore to properly challenge the case against me. ""I have not been allowed to see the evidence. I have tried everything, including offers of conciliation, mediation and legal arbitration to resolve these matters both properly and amicably. ""This would have been in everybody's interests, particularly those of the two complainants. All of these efforts have been rejected."" Mr Salmond was elected as the SNP MP for Gordon in 2015 before losing the seat in the snap general election two years later. He has faced heavy criticism for hosting the Alex Salmond Show on Russian broadcaster RT, which has been described as a propaganda channel for the Kremlin - a claim Mr Salmond has denied. RT has said that the show would continue to be broadcast ""at this time"".

"Problem solved - according to Mr Trump after his June summit with Kim Jong-un US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will not be travelling to North Korea in the immediate future after Donald Trump asked him to call off a planned trip. The president tweeted that insufficient progress was being made in dismantling Pyongyang's nuclear programme. He also suggested China was not doing enough to put pressure on North Korea - due to trade tensions with the US. After his summit with the North Korean leader in June, Mr Trump said the country was no longer a nuclear threat. But since then there have been several reports that it is failing to dismantle nuclear facilities. One of the most recent warnings came from unnamed US officials, who told the Washington Post that North Korea appeared to be building new intercontinental ballistic missiles. The UN's nuclear agency (IAEA) has also said North Korea is continuing with its nuclear programme. Is North Korea sticking with its nukes? Who are Kim Jong-un's running bodyguards? Tears and joy as Korean families reunite Mr Pompeo was due to head to Pyongyang next week with his newly appointed special envoy for North Korea - Stephen Biegun, a retiring Ford executive. It would have been the secretary of state's fourth trip, though he was not expected to meet North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. Mr Trump took a swipe at China in the second of three tweets on the issue.

""There is no longer a nuclear threat from North Korea,"" Mr Trump tweeted on arriving back in the US from the June summit with Mr Kim in Singapore. ""Everybody can feel much safer,"" he said. After the optimism of Singapore, the latest development might seem like quite a change. Mike Pompeo during his last visit in July But there have been ups and downs in the Trump-North Korea relationship since then. After a visit by Mr Pompeo in July, North Korea condemned his ""gangster-like demands"", only for another trip to be announced, albeit now cancelled. And the summit itself was called off in May - Mr Trump citing Pyongyang's ""open hostility"" - only for it to take place after all. The US has made clear that it wants to see an end to the North's nuclear activities before it will consider lifting economic sanctions. The summit was seen as possible turning point after a ratcheting up of tensions. North Korea had carried out a sixth nuclear bomb test in September and boasted of its ability to launch a missile at the United States.

"Alex Salmond denies the claims made against him Two people have made sexual harassment complaints against Scotland's former first minister Alex Salmond. The complaints, which he denies, relate to his time in office. Why have they come to light now? Permanent Secretary Leslie Evans (second left) with First Minister Nicola Sturgeon In November, in the wake of the Harvey Weinstein scandal and the #Metoo movement, there were concerns over reports that women at all levels in the Scottish Parliament had experienced harassment. At the same time, MPs at Westminster were accused of intimidating or propositioning young women inappropriately. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon called for an internal review to be carried out of the Scottish government's procedures for handling complaints in the workplace. As part of that review, a new procedure on handling harassment complaints involving current or former ministers was introduced. Two complaints in relation to Mr Salmond were made in January of this year. According to the Daily Record, they relate to events in 2013 when he was first minister. Scotland's top civil servant, Leslie Evans, informed Mr Salmond on Wednesday 22 August that she was considering the public interest in making the fact of the complaints and investigation publicly known. Mr Salmond, who was Scottish first minister from 2007 to 2014 and oversaw the independence referendum, instigated legal action aimed at preventing the Scottish government revealing details of its investigation but later dropped those proceedings. The next evening, Mr Salmond put out a statement denying claims of harassment and saying he was launching a court action to contest the Scottish government's complaints process. The details of the claims of sexual harassment and who made them have not been officially released. The Scottish government's permanent secretary, Ms Evans, would only confirm that two complaints of sexual harassment had been made against Mr Salmond. The Scottish government insisted the investigation had been ""entirely confidential"". However, the Daily Record, which broke the story on Thursday 23 August, later claimed to have seen the wording of an allegation by a Scottish government staff member. It says she alleges Mr Salmond touched her bottom and breasts through her clothing while she was alone with him at at the first minister's official residence, Bute House, in December 2013. Police Scotland has confirmed that it is ""carrying out an assessment of information which we have received and inquiries are at an early stage"". Mr Salmond has strongly denied any claims of harassment or criminality. He also accused someone in the Scottish government of ""sustained leaking"" of the ""most unfair kind"". He said it was ""crucial"" to find out who in government was responsible. The former first minister was told in March this year that allegations had been made against him and he had been assured that the process would be confidential. He claims he has still not been allowed to see the evidence against him. His statement called the procedure ""unjust"" and said he had not been able to properly challenge the case against him. Mr Salmond said the procedure, put into operation by Ms Evans three years after he left office, was ""grossly unfair"" and would lead to prejudicial outcomes. On Wednesday 29 August, Mr Salmond lodged a petition with the Court of Session in Edinburgh seeking a Judicial Review. It will decide the issue of the lawfulness of the procedure. The court will now seek a response from the Scottish government. It is likely to be some weeks before there is a hearing before a judge. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she had no role in the process First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she became aware in April that Mr Salmond was being investigated. In fact, it was Mr Salmond himself that told her. She said she had no prior knowledge of complaints being made against him. Ms Sturgeon said she had taken ""no role in the process"" and not spoken about it publicly because she did not want to compromise the internal investigation. She said the fact that complaints were made could not be ignored or swept under the carpet."" Mr Salmond announced on Wednesday 29 August he was resigning from the SNP. The ex-first minister said he intended to apply to rejoin the party once he had an opportunity to clear his name. He said he was quitting because he wanted to avoid potential divisions within the party, which has faced calls to suspend him. A Judicial Review will consider whether a proper ""decision-making process"" was followed by the Scottish government. It will not look at whether or not the ""correct"" decision was made. The court will seek to ensure that principles of natural justice and fairness have been followed. Before the review can be heard Mr Salmond must appeal to the Court of Session for permission to proceed. Permission will only be granted where the Judicial Review has ""a real prospect of success"". His petition was formally lodged with the court earlier this week, and the Scottish government will now have an opportunity to respond.

"There are ""no criminal suspicions"" over the deaths of John and Susan Cooper, the Egyptian authorities say A British couple who died on holiday in Egypt suffered heart and respiratory failure, local authorities have said. John Cooper, 69, and his wife Susan, 63, from Burnley, were staying at the Steigenberger Aqua Magic in the Red Sea resort of Hurghada. The couple's daughter, who was also staying at the hotel, said she believed their deaths were suspicious. The Red Sea governorate said medical checks by a health inspector revealed ""no criminal suspicions"". Thomas Cook said it wasremoving all its customersfrom the Steigenberger Aqua Magic as a ""precautionary measure"". It added that the circumstances of the deaths were ""unclear"". Kelly Ormerod, pictured with her mother, says her parents were healthy the day before they died The couple's daughter Kelly Ormerod, who was staying in the hotel with her three children, told the BBC something ""doesn't add up"" about the explanations of her parents' deaths. ""I believe their deaths are not due to natural causes,"" she said. ""My parents went to sleep on the Monday evening, fit, healthy and in good spirits, and awoke the following morning in very poor health."" Mrs Ormerod said the authorities had failed to keep her updated on the situation and were preventing her from leaving the country. ""I need answers,"" she added. In a statement, authorities in Egypt said Mr Cooper died in his hotel room at 11:00 local time on Tuesday. He had suffered a ""sharp drop in blood circulation and a sudden stop in the heart muscle"", and his cause of death was listed as ""sudden failure in the heart muscle and respiratory failure"". Mrs Cooper was taken to hospital five hours later in a ""state of fainting"" and, although heart recovery work took place for 30 minutes, she died at 17:12. Up to 1,600 guests are staying at the hotel, according to owner Deutsche Hospitality The authorities said her cause of death was a ""drop of blood circulation and respiratory functions"". Egypt's tourism minister Rania Al-Mashat told the BBC the public prosecution office was investigating and would report ""within the next week or 10 days"". Thomas Cook said the circumstances of the deaths were ""unclear"", but it had no evidence that carbon monoxide was a factor. On Thursday, it said it had received ""further reports of a raised level of illness among guests"" at the hotel. It said 301 holidaymakers would have options for different hotels from Friday and those wishing to go home would be flown back. Sven Hirschler, senior director of corporate communications for Deutsche Hospitality, which owns the Steigenberger brand, said there was not an unusual level of illness among the 1,600 guests staying at the hotel. He said that Mr Cooper had complained of low blood pressure and was treated by the hotel's on-site doctor on the day he died. This video can not be played Janine Traviss and her husband fell ill during a stay at the same hotel Janette Rawlingson, 43, from Chelmsford, Essex, who arrived at the hotel with her husband and two children on Tuesday, said Thomas Cook staff told guests at a meeting it was testing samples from the restaurant and swimming pool. ""Other guests are saying there are 40 people ill at the hotel with vomiting and diarrhoea,"" she said. ""A reasonable person can't help but wonder if there's a link between that illness and these deaths."" Other holidaymakers have told the BBC about their experiences with illness during stays at the Steigenberger Aqua Magic. Janine Traviss, from Oldham, said she and her partner fell ill with a stomach bug during a holiday earlier this month. ""I subsequently have been ill for several weeks now since returning and had to visit the doctor on two occasions with two full weeks of antibiotics,"" she said. ""I am still recovering and still feel very tired and exhausted most days."" Thomas Cook said it was working closely with the hotel and supporting the local authorities with their investigations. It stated the hotel was last audited late last month and received an overall score of 96%. ""We will be contacting those customers due to travel to the Steigenberger Aqua Magic Hotel in Hurghada in the next four weeks to offer alternative holiday options,"" the tour operator added. Susan Cooper worked at the Thomas Cook branch in Burnley Mrs Cooper worked at the travel firm's Burnley branch, which remained closed for a second day on Friday. She has been described as a ""loyal and long-serving"" member of staff by the company. Alban Barker, 70, who lives close to the Coopers' home, paid tribute to a ""really great couple"" who were season ticket holders at Burnley. He said Mr Cooper, a clay pigeon shooting enthusiast, was an ""extremely good, very reliable builder"". ""I bumped into them the other week and told him 'it's about time you retired' and he just laughed and said, 'I'm fine, I'm fit enough'. ""He looked well, he was a strong man.""

"This video can not be played Pope Francis spoke out on abuse on a visit to Ireland Pope Francis has said he is ashamed of the Catholic Church's failure to adequately address the ""repellent crimes"" of sex abuse by clergy. The Irish prime minister earlier delivered a strong warning to the Pope to take action against clergy involved in child abuse and keeping it secret. The Pope spent 90 minutes with abuse survivors, reportedly telling them he viewed clerical sex abuse as ""filth"". The papal visit is the first to the Irish Republic for 39 years. It coincides with the World Meeting of Families, a global Catholic gatheringheld every three years,external. LIVE: Pope Francis in Ireland Longform: What happened to Catholic Ireland? How Ireland received a penitent Pope In graphs - Irish flock without shepherds? The Argentine Pope's opening remarks echoed a letter he sent to the world's 1.2bn Roman Catholics this week, in which he condemned the""atrocities"" of child abuse and clerical cover-ups. This video can not be played Pope Francis travels through Dublin city centre on his Popemobile ""I cannot fail to acknowledge the grave scandal caused in Ireland by the abuse of young people by members of the Church charged with responsibility for their protection and education,"" the Pope told political leaders and dignitaries at Dublin Castle. ""The failure of ecclesiastical authorities - bishops, religious superiors, priests and others - adequately to address these repellent crimes has rightly given rise to outrage, and remains a source of pain and shame for the Catholic community,"" he said. ""I myself share those sentiments."" The Pope veered off his script when speaking out about abuse, saying he had set out a ""greater commitment to eliminating this scourge in the Church, at any cost"". The Pope smiled and waved as at Dublin Airport, but his arrival was more understated than the dramatic tarmac kiss of Pope John Paul II in 1979 He was speaking after Irish PM Leo Varadkar said the failures of the Church, the state and wider society had created a ""bitter and broken heritage for so many, leaving a legacy of pain and suffering"". ""Magdalene Laundries, mother-and-baby homes, industrial schools, illegal adoptions and clerical child abuse are stains on our state, our society and also the Catholic Church,"" he said,referring to a series of scandals that have rocked the Irish Church. ""People kept in dark corners, behind closed doors, cries for help that went unheard... Above all, Holy Father, I ask to you to listen to the victims and survivors."" A rainbow flag is flown next to a likeness of Pope Francis as crowds wait on Christchurch, Dublin Mr Varadkar said there could be zero tolerance for those who abuse children or who facilitate that abuse and that from words action must flow. He referred to an investigation in the US state of Pennsylvania thatfound that more than 1,000 identifiable minors had been abused by 300 priests. Mr Varadkar said the ""heartbreaking stories"" of ""unspeakable crimes"", perpetrated by religious officials and then obscured to protect the institutions, was a story ""all too tragically familiar"" to people in Ireland. By BBC News NI's Leanna Byrne in Dublin It could be a case of expectations versus reality - the expectation of a charismatic kneel to the ground and a kiss on the tarmac, of fanfare and hysteria. But that was in 1979 and this is now. Nearly 40 years after Pope John Paul II received an emphatic welcome,Pope Francis is visiting a different country. The Republic of Ireland today is more secular, far more liberal and, in many cases, angry. Read more: How Ireland received a penitent Pope Leo Varadkar said he hoped action, not just words would flow from the Catholic Church Colm O'Gorman of Amnesty International Ireland, who was abused by a priest for more than two years as a teenager, said the Pope's comments did not go far enough. ""He could have talked to us all in a way that was blunt, that was clear, that was frank, that was human, that was accessible,"" he said. Two of the abuse survivors who met the Pope said afterwards he condemned corruption and cover-ups within the Church as ""caca"". ""Literally filth as one sees in a toilet, his translator clarified,"" said a statement from Clodagh Malone and Paul Redmond. Another abuse survivor who was at the meeting, west Belfast priest Fr Patrick McCafferty, said the Pope had promised to ""make people resign"". He said: ""I got the strong impression that no-one will be exempt from just penalties who have offended, who have covered up. ""The damage [by] those who have covered up could even be said to be worse than [that of] the offenders."" Having been presented with flowers and vestments by children after his aeroplane Shepherd One touched down at Dublin Airport, the Pope was welcomed by President Michael D Higgins at Ãras an UachtarÃ¡in (the president's residence). At St Mary's Pro-Cathedral in Dublin, Pope Francis prayed silently in front of a candle that commemorates abuse victims, before answering questions from couples of all ages on the subject of marriage. He also visited a Capuchin day centre for the homeless. On Saturday evening, he presided over a Festival of Families concert in Dublin's Croke Park stadium, which drew a crowd of some 80,000 people. The world-renowned tenor Andrea Bocelli, country singer Nathan Carter, and acclaimed Irish singer Daniel O'Donnell were among those who performed. The pontiff will travel to County Mayo on Sunday morning for a visit to Knock Shrine, before returning to Dublin to close the World Meeting of Families at an afternoon Mass in front of an estimated 500,000 people in Phoenix Park. The Pope held a silent prayer in front of a candle that commemorates abuse victims The Ireland that he is visiting is a different country to that whichgreeted Pope John Paul II in 1979. Since the Polish pope's visit, there have been huge changes in public attitudes to social issues including abortion, contraception, divorce and same-sex marriage. The older population is more likely to describe themselves as Catholic The countryvoted for constitutional change on gay marriage in 2015andvoted overwhelmingly to overturn its strict abortion law in May. The Pope heard Mr Varadkar, a gay man, speak out against the traditional Catholic teaching on the family. He said that the Republic of Ireland had modernised its laws, ""understanding that marriages do not always work, that women should make their own decisions and that families come in many forms"" - including those headed by a lone parent, same-sex parents or parents who are divorced and remarried.

"This video can not be played Corbyn suggests a group of Zionists need lessons in history and irony Jeremy Corbyn has defended comments he made about a group of British Zionists having ""no sense of English irony"", saying he is careful with language now. A 2013 clip was published by the Daily Mail as the Labour leader works to tackle anti-Semitism in his party. Luciana Berger, a Jewish Labour MP, had said hearing Mr Corbyn's speech made her feel ""unwelcome"" in the party. Mr Corbyn said he used the term Zionist in an ""accurate political sense and not as a euphemism for Jewish people"". Zionism refers to the movement to create a Jewish state in the Middle East, roughly corresponding to the historical land of Israel, and thus support for the modern state of Israel. A guide to Labour anti-Semitism claims What's the difference between anti-Semitism and anti-Zionism? Jewish MP 'feels unwelcome' after Corbyn comments In the speech - made at an event at the Palestinian Return Centre - Mr Corbyn recalled a disagreement between some Zionists and the Palestinian representative to the UK, Manuel Hassassian, following a speech Mr Hassassian had made in Parliament. He said: ""This [Hassassian's speech] was dutifully recorded by the thankfully silent Zionists who were in the audience on that occasion, and then came up and berated him afterwards for what he'd said."" Mr Corbyn, who was a backbench MP at the time, went on to claim that the people concerned ""clearly have two problems"". ""One is they don't want to study history, and secondly, having lived in this country for a very long time, probably all their lives, they don't understand English irony either."" But in a statement on Friday evening, Mr Corbyn said he spoke to ""defend the Palestinian ambassador in the face of what I thought were deliberate misrepresentations"" from people ""for whom English was a first language, when it isn't for the ambassador"". He said: ""I described those pro-Israel activists as Zionists, in the accurate political sense and not as a euphemism for Jewish people - and that is made clear in the rest of my speech that day. ""I am now more careful with how I might use the term 'Zionist' because a once self-identifying political term has been increasingly hijacked by anti-Semites as code for Jews."" Richard Millett, who believes he is one of the people Mr Corbyn was referring to, said the Labour leader's comments were racist and ""deeply antisemitic"", calling for him to apologise. The blogger, who was at the event Mr Corbyn referenced in the speech, said suggesting he did not understand English irony ""implies that I'm not from here, not from the United Kingdom. To highlight that, I find very offensive. It was unnecessary to do it, and racist."" A number of other Labour MPs had expressed solidarity with Ms Berger, after shetweeted,external: ""The video released today of the leader of @UKLabour making inexcusable comments - defended by a party spokesman - makes me as a proud British Jew feel unwelcome in my own party. ""I've lived in Britain all my life and I don't need any lessons in history/irony."" Allies of Mr Corbyn said the speech was ""taken out of context"". Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said the focus should not be on what Mr Corbyn said five years ago, before he became party leader, but on tackling anti-Semitism in British society, including within Labour. Mr Corbyn, he said, had devoted his political life to pursuing peace and reconciliation in the Middle East while Labour was committed to playing a ""full role"" in tackling anti-Semitism within its own ranks and in society. Meanwhile, a Conservative MP has asked the Parliamentary standards watchdog to investigate Mr Corbyn's remarks. Helen Grant, the Tory vice-chairwoman for communities, argues they breach the code of conduct for MPs and bring Parliament into disrepute.

"Floodwaters are receding in Kerala - but have left behind a glut of snakes Flood victims returning home in the Indian state of Kerala have been warned to prepare for a new menace: Snakes. Several snake-catching teams have been deployed to affected areas, amid fears the reptiles could be hiding in cupboards, under carpets, or inside washing machines in previously submerged homes. Hospitals in the worst-hit areas are readying supplies of anti-venom. Devastating flooding has killed around 400 people in Kerala since June. More than a million others were displaced, with many of them taking shelter in thousands of relief camps across the southern state. As well as the glut of snakes, scorpions and other insects are reported to have moved into human homes.

"KSI (left) and Logan Paul showed off their physiques at the weigh-in on Friday KSI and Logan Paul, YouTube stars with 37 million subscribers between them, will take their beef into the boxing ring on Saturday for a fight billed as ""the biggest event in internet history"". KSI or Logan Paul? YouTube fans around the world have chosen whose side they are on, and will be watching when the pair of social media heavyweights step into the ring at Manchester Arena. Both are wildly popular, both are massively divisive, both have highly controversial pasts. KSI is the brash 25-year-old British gamer, comedy vlogger and rapper whose videos have racked up 4.4 billion views despite heavy criticism for lewd comments towards women in some of his clips. Logan Paul is the 23-year-old US prankster (and former state wrestler) who made his name on Vine before moving to YouTube, where he's had 3.9 billion views, and whocaused outrage earlier this yearfor showing the body of an apparent suicide victim in Japan. Both have cultivated a frenzied online feud in order to hype up this bout, which will be streamed pay-per-view on YouTube. Their brothers Jake Paul (4.9 billion views) and Deji (3.3 billion) will fight on the undercard. Logan apparently fed KSI chewing gum at the weigh-in Both seem to have largely shrugged off their controversies, but the fight will be seen by some as a way to prop up, and cash in on, their careers. Asked by BBC News whether he's hoping to redeem himself, Logan says: ""I don't think this is the redemption. I think it may mark a part of it, but by no means is this fight a redemption for my mistake that happened in January. ""But I think it is an opportunity to for me to have taken a step back from the internet and focus my efforts elsewhere, and it's an opportunity for me to show the world a new version of Logan Paul, not just silly internet vlog boy."" KSI, when asked whether he has regrets about his past behaviour, tells BBC News: ""I definitely have regrets for some of the things I've said and done, but you know, I'm a human being and human beings make mistakes. ""Because it's me, it's showcased all over the internet, but that's just how it is."" Social media can be a combative place, so perhaps it's logical for social superstars to take their hostility a into the real world. At one of KSI's training sessions in Manchester before the fight, fan Shaf Miah, 25, from London, says the white-collar amateur bout is ""the next level of internet beef"". He says: ""If you read comments [on YouTube], people want to physically hit someone if they don't like them or if they've done something annoying. And to see their favourite YouTuber do it for them, they're obviously going to pay money to watch it."" This video can not be played How Logan and Jake Paul became social media superstars Michael Zepeda, 21, has come from LA for the fight. ""They've both got a lot of subscribers, they both get a lot of views,"" he says. ""Everybody wants to watch. ""I want to see Logan get his ass beat. He deserves it. He's done many messed up things for views. He crossed that line, definitely."" CJ Melia, 21, has travelled to Manchester from Dublin. ""I cannot wait,"" he says. ""I'm so excited for this. I've been watching KSI for about nine years. He's the reason I started my first YouTube channel eight years ago. ""I never thought something like this would happen. This is the biggest event YouTube has ever done."" This video can not be played Tyson Fury has a few thoughts This all started when two other YouTubers - Joe Weller and Theo Baker, AKA Malfoy - went into the ring last year, and KSI said he would fight the winner. KSI took on Weller at the Copper Box Arena in London in February, and won. That was streamed live on YouTube for free, with 1.8 million people watching live and 36 million more watching on the pair's official channels since. Weller has five million subscribers to Logan Paul's 18 million. Saturday's fight will be much bigger - but this time, punters have to pay Â£7.50 to watch. Really? The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge might have something to say about that. Their 2011 weddingholds the Guinness World Record,externalfor the most live streams for a single event, at 72 million - although that obviously wasn't a product of the online world, as this fight is. YouTuber Jordan Antle, who goes by the name TheFearRaiser, says the fight's billing is not over the top. ""This is a massive event and I would definitely say this is going to be one of the biggest internet events so far in history,"" he tells BBC News. ""Seeing two YouTubers who have a large fanbase fighting each other live in front of millions of people in unheard of. It's a very strange combination of two worlds and it's attracting a lot of attention because of how different it is."" Jake Paul has also tried football, playing in a charity match in Houston in December KSI and the Paul brothers have certainly been doing their best to whip their fans into a frenzy. Insult-filled videos and diss tracks have flown back and forth, and ill-tempered press conferences have taken place in Los Angeles and London. And on Wednesday, Deji turned up unannounced at the Pauls' training gym in Manchester and ended up getting a slap from Jake. Mystery Russian satellite raises US alarm Face transplant for suicide survivor Football fans' Babestation surprise The antics have all been more WWE than WBO. But KSI's manager Liam Chivers insists it's ""100% real"". He says: ""People think these guys are not professional boxers, this is just a bit of fun, it's just an amateur fight. ""No - these two guys are on an absolute pedestal and they have egos, they have hugely passionate audiences. ""This is the modern-day mainstream of fandom, this is where the pressure is at, and these two guys have built their reputations and audiences over however many years, and it's all on the line. ""Plus the fact they're promotional geniuses and they've applied that and have attacked each other so hard that they are really very upset with each other. There's not one little bit of fake beef about it."" KSI also has a music career - his debut album reached 13 in the UK chart in 2016 More than 15,000 tickets have been sold for Manchester Arena, but Chivers is reluctant to predict how many people will sign up to watch online. ""It's really hard to know - this is the first time this has ever been done,"" he says. ""If you said a number of a couple of hundred thousand buys, I'd say that was not good but that would cover costs."" The fight will cost Â£7.50 to watch in the UK or $10 in the US - much less than a big professional pay-per-view fight, but much more than people are used to paying on YouTube. ""There's a YouTube culture of not buying and it's a whole educational process to see how many tune in,"" Chivers says. Taking part in high-profile real-life contests is nothing new for YouTubers - although, with Zoella on The Great Comic Relief Bake-Off in 2015 and her brother Joe Sugg in this year's Strictly Come Dancing, other British examples have been more sedate. So with their attention-grabbing aggression, KSI and Logan Paul have stumbled across an effective way to boost their profiles and bank balances, and other YouTubers may follow suit. No matter who wins bragging rights in Manchester - and the victor will brag a lot - the pair have already agreed to a rematch in the US. This beef has only just begun.

"US Senator John McCain of Arizona has been battling cancer since last summer US Republican Senator John McCain will no longer be continuing treatment for his brain cancer, his family has announced. His family said he had ""surpassed expectations for his survival"" and made the choice to end his treatment. Mr McCain, 81, was diagnosed with an aggressive brain tumour in July 2017 and had been undergoing medical treatment. He left Washington in December, but has remained a vocal political figure. Who is Senator John McCain? His family said in a statement shared with US media: ""Last year, Senator John McCain shared with Americans the news our family already knew: he had been diagnosed with an aggressive glioblastoma, and the prognosis was serious. ""In the year since, John has surpassed expectations for his survival. But the progress of disease and the inexorable advance of age render their verdict. ""With his usual strength of will, he has chosen to discontinue medical treatment."" The six-term senator and 2008 Republican presidential nominee was diagnosed after doctors discovered his tumour during surgery to remove a blood clot from above his left eye last July. The son and grandson of Navy admirals, Mr McCain was a fighter pilot during the Vietnam War. When his plane was shot down, he spent more than five years as a prisoner of war. While in the custody of his captors, he suffered torture that left him with lasting disabilities. John McCain at the Naval Academy at Annapolis, circa 1954 In atweet,external, Meghan McCain, Mr McCain's daughter, said that her family ""is deeply appreciative of all the love and generosity"" they have received over the past year. His wife, Cindy McCain, alsosaid on Twitter,external: ""I love my husband with all of my heart. God bless everyone who has cared for my husband along the journey."" Mr McCain represented his state in the Senate and House for 35 years and has been a strong voice within the Republican party.

Their tense relationship began in 2015, when he said then-candidate Trump had ""fired up the crazies"" at his rallies with controversial remarks on immigration. Mr Trump hit back by saying Mr McCain was only considered a hero because he was a prisoner of war, adding: ""I like people who weren't captured."" Last summer, Mr McCain - still facially scarred from surgery - gave a dramatic thumbs-down on the Senate floor that torpedoed a Trump-backed bill to repeal Obamacare. He left Capitol Hill last December to begin treatment at the Mayo Clinic in Phoenix, Arizona. In April, he underwent surgery again for an intestinal infection. Mr McCain has been recovering from treatments and receiving physical therapy from a team of caregivers at his home near Sedona since leaving Washington. He turns 82 on 29 August. Glioblastoma is a particularlyaggressive brain cancer,external, and increases in frequency with age, affecting more men than women. In his memoir, released in May, Mr McCain said: ""Before I leave, I'd like to see our politics begin to return to the purposes and practices that distinguish our history from the history of other nations. ""I'd like to see us recover our sense that we are more alike than different."" Who is Senator John McCain?

"Grande's new album was released the day after Franklin died Ariana Grande has topped the UK album chart in a week that saw three Aretha Franklin albums re-enter the Top 40. Grande said she was ""so grateful"" to score her second UK number one album with Sweetener, which sold 45,000 copies in its first week on release. Meanwhile, Franklin's death saw a surge of interest in her back catalogue. Respect and I Say A Little Prayer were streamed more than a million times each this week, data collated by the Official Charts Company revealed. Date set for Aretha Franklin funeral Madonna hits back over Aretha tribute Ariana Grande's Sweetener: The stories behind the songs Grande last topped the albums chart with Dangerous Woman, which spent one week in the top spot in 2016. ""Thank you so much! I'm so grateful! I can't tell you how appreciative I am,"" said the 25-year-old about her latest chart coup. Sweetener's success brought an end to the Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again soundtrack's four-week chart-topping reign. It is one of four entries in this week's Top 10, which also sees debuts for Bugzy Malone, Gabrielle and Slaves at six, seven and eight respectively. Franklin's death at the age of 76is reflected by the presence of her Soul Queen album at 15 and her 30 Greatest Hits compilation at 16. Another compilation, Respect - The Very Best of Aretha Franklin, can be found in 27th place. In the singles chart, George Ezra's Shotgun remains number one for a fourth straight week. Drake's In My Feelings is another non-mover at two, while Eastside by Benny Blanco, Halsey and Khalid rises one place to two. Calvin Harris and Sam Smith's Promises was the most downloaded track of the last seven days, enough to make it this week's highest new entry at four. Grande has three songs in this week's Top 40: God is a Woman at six, Breathin at eight and Sweetener's title track at 22. All are higher placed than the highest charting Aretha track, I Say A Little Prayer, which sits just outside the Top 50 at 51.

The president tweeted that insufficient progress was being made in dismantling Pyongyang's nuclear programme. He also suggested China was not doing enough to put pressure on North Korea - due to trade tensions with the US. After his summit with the North Korean leader in June, Mr Trump said the country was no longer a nuclear threat. But since then there have been several reports that it is failing to dismantle nuclear facilities. One of the most recent warnings came from unnamed US officials, who told the Washington Post that North Korea appeared to be building new intercontinental ballistic missiles. The UN's nuclear agency (IAEA) has also said North Korea is continuing with its nuclear programme. Is North Korea sticking with its nukes? Who are Kim Jong-un's running bodyguards? Tears and joy as Korean families reunite Mr Pompeo was due to head to Pyongyang next week with his newly appointed special envoy for North Korea - Stephen Biegun, a retiring Ford executive. It would have been the secretary of state's fourth trip, though he was not expected to meet North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. Mr Trump took a swipe at China in the second of three tweets on the issue.

After the optimism of Singapore, the latest development might seem like quite a change. Mike Pompeo during his last visit in July But there have been ups and downs in the Trump-North Korea relationship since then. After a visit by Mr Pompeo in July, North Korea condemned his ""gangster-like demands"", only for another trip to be announced, albeit now cancelled. And the summit itself was called off in May - Mr Trump citing Pyongyang's ""open hostility"" - only for it to take place after all. The US has made clear that it wants to see an end to the North's nuclear activities before it will consider lifting economic sanctions. The summit was seen as possible turning point after a ratcheting up of tensions. North Korea had carried out a sixth nuclear bomb test in September and boasted of its ability to launch a missile at the United States.

"Hurricane Lane has been downgraded to a tropical storm as it churns towards Hawaii, but is still causing flash flooding and landslides. Schools and offices were closed as residents took shelter from the storm, which pummelled the US state with strong winds and torrential rain. But Hawaii looks was spared its first direct hit by a major storm in 25 years. President Donald Trump earlier declared a state of emergency for the state. The White House said federal authorities were on standby to provide support and supplies to local and state emergency response efforts. The Central Pacific Hurricane Center said early on Friday afternoon Hurricane Lane was ""weakening quickly"", with sustained winds of 85 mph (137km/h). By 17:00 local time (03:00 GMT Saturday), the sustained wind speed had dropped to 70 mph, although ""more flooding and damaging winds"" were expected on parts of the islands. Hawaii residents carry dogs to safety as Hurricane Lane has prompts evacuations throughout the island. Weather Service forecaster Leigh Anne Eaton said some parts of Big Island had already seen almost 3ft (90cm) or rain. Meanwhile, the National Weather Service said there had been ""catastrophic flooding"" and wind gusts reaching 67mph (108 kmph). Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) chief Brock Long took to Twitter to warn those in Hawaii to ""heed the warnings of local officials and stay aware of your surroundings"" until the danger had passed. An image from the Hawaiian Department of Transportation posted a photo of a landslide blocking a highway on the Big Island/ Amidst concerns of the approaching storm, emergency personnel responded to ""rapidly spreading"" brush fire in western Maui. The fire has prompted highway closures, power outages and precautionary evacuations. Lane was also forecast to cause dangerous surf heights of up to 25ft (7.6m) in Maui and Oahu. Officials warned of ""significant beach erosion"" and waves hitting coastal roadways. Meanwhile, United Airlines said it had cancelled all Friday flights to and from the main airports on Maui, the second-largest island. Hurricanes: A perfect storm of chance and climate change?

A member of staff at a local service station in Haleiwa, on the north shore of Oahu island, told AFP news agency that motorists had been ""constantly filling"" their vehicles. ""Everybody is in a panic mode right now, everyone is filling up gas, gas cans, propane cans,"" he said.

This video can not be played Tomasz Schafernaker has the latest forecast for Hurricane Lane Hawaii Governor David Ige urged residents to set aside supplies of water, food and medicines as a precaution and to avoid driving if possible. Dozens of evacuation centres were also set up throughout the day as Mr Trump urged Hawaiians to hunker down and prepare for the worst. According to NWS, only four named storms have made landfall in Hawaii since 1959 - and only two of those storms were hurricanes. Hawaii generally sees about one storm strong enough to earn a name pass within 60 miles of the islands every four years. Earlier this month, Hurricane Hector, a category four storm, also passed by the islands, though it did not come as close as Lane. The state has also seen serious volcanic eruptions this summer, withlava and ash spewing from the Kilauea volcanoon the Big Island since May. This video can not be played The BBC's James Cook had a lucky escape after a tree hit him as he delivered a radio report A guide to the world's deadliest storms  Hurricanes are violent storms that can bring devastation to coastal areas, threatening lives, homes and businesses. Hurricanes develop from thunderstorms, fuelled by warm, moist air as they cross sub-tropical waters.Warm air rises into the storm. Air swirls in to fill the low pressure in the storm, sucking air in and upwards, reinforcing the low pressure. The storm rotates due to the spin of the earth and energy from the warm ocean increases wind speeds as it builds. When winds reach 119km/h (74mph), it is known as a hurricane - in the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific - or a typhoon in the Western Pacific. ""Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face.

"Nottingham City Council said the homeless people left after two of their officers gave them some advice Two homeless people have been found living in caves near a city centre for at least two weeks. The pair set a tent up inside one of the caves and used the other for storage after somehow getting past an 8ft-high fence. Nottingham City Council said the homeless people left after two of their officers gave them some advice. However, a residents' association chairman is worried the pair may now be living in even worse conditions. The caves where the pair set up camp are on the edge of Nottingham city centre ""It is very sad,"" said Greg Feltham from Sneinton Tenants and Residents Association. ""There has been such an increase in people rough sleeping in this area."" He added that sleeping in caves ""is not how people should be living in the 21st Century. They should have more appropriate accommodation to meet their needs."" Nottingham has about 850 man-made caves which were previously used as dungeons, bomb shelters and homes. These particular ones are known as the Sneinton Hermitage caves and are on the edge of Nottingham city centre. ""It is a relatively small area with two little caves side-by-side,"" said Mr Feltham. ""One had their tent in and they were using the other for general storage."" It is thought the pair had been living in the caves for about two and a half weeks Mr Feltham said there used to be quite a lot of rough sleepers in the caves before the fencing was installed a few years ago. ""Somehow this couple have found a way of getting over it,"" he said. ""I would like to see a concentrated effort nationally in helping homeless people."" The caves are locked up to deter homeless people from sheltering in them Nottingham City Council said its community protection officers (CPOs) became aware of the rough sleepers earlier this week, went to check on their welfare and told them about the support services available. ""By the time our CPOs returned on Thursday, the pair had moved on, and so they arranged for the clear-up of the site, including the removal of drugs paraphernalia.""

"RAF Typhoons have been based in Romania since April (library image) RAF fighter jets have intercepted a Russian military aircraft over the Black Sea for the second time in a week, the Ministry of Defence has said. The Typhoons were scrambled from a base in Romania on Thursday after a Be-12 maritime patrol aircraft was seen heading south-west from Crimea towards Nato airspace. The RAF has a leading role in Nato's air policing mission in the region. About 150 UK personnel are stationed at the Mihail Kogalniceanu base. Nato made a commitment to boosting security on its eastern flank following Russia's annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014. 1 (Fighter) Squadron, based at RAF Lossiemouth, Moray, has been operating alongside the Romanian Air Force from the base near Constanta since April. It was the RAF's fifth such incident involving Russian aircraft since the Nato mission began. On Tuesday, two British Typhoon jetsshadowed two suspected Russian Su-30 Flanker aircraft,external. The RAF said the Typhoons were scrambled on Thursday to ""deter provocative Russian aircraft and reassure Romania and Nato allies"". More than 800 British troops have also been deployed to Estonia as part of an enhanced Nato presence in the Baltic states. Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson stressed the UK's commitment to Nato and European security. Mr Williamson said: ""Whether in the skies over the Black Sea and the Baltic, or on the ground in Estonia, our actions send a clear message - we are collectively ready to respond to any act of aggression and will support our Eastern European allies to deter any threats faced.""

"US Senator John McCain of Arizona has been battling cancer since last summer US Republican Senator John McCain will no longer be continuing treatment for his brain cancer, his family has announced. His family said he had ""surpassed expectations for his survival"" and made the choice to end his treatment. Mr McCain, 81, was diagnosed with an aggressive brain tumour in July 2017 and had been undergoing medical treatment. He left Washington in December, but has remained a vocal political figure. Who is Senator John McCain? His family said in a statement shared with US media: ""Last year, Senator John McCain shared with Americans the news our family already knew: he had been diagnosed with an aggressive glioblastoma, and the prognosis was serious. ""In the year since, John has surpassed expectations for his survival. But the progress of disease and the inexorable advance of age render their verdict. ""With his usual strength of will, he has chosen to discontinue medical treatment."" The six-term senator and 2008 Republican presidential nominee was diagnosed after doctors discovered his tumour during surgery to remove a blood clot from above his left eye last July. The son and grandson of Navy admirals, Mr McCain was a fighter pilot during the Vietnam War. When his plane was shot down, he spent more than five years as a prisoner of war. While in the custody of his captors, he suffered torture that left him with lasting disabilities. John McCain at the Naval Academy at Annapolis, circa 1954 In atweet,external, Meghan McCain, Mr McCain's daughter, said that her family ""is deeply appreciative of all the love and generosity"" they have received over the past year.

Their tense relationship began in 2015, when he said then-candidate Trump had ""fired up the crazies"" at his rallies with controversial remarks on immigration. Mr Trump hit back by saying Mr McCain was only considered a hero because he was a prisoner of war, adding: ""I like people who weren't captured."" Last summer, Mr McCain - still facially scarred from surgery - gave a dramatic thumbs-down on the Senate floor that torpedoed a Trump-backed bill to repeal Obamacare.

"The forests around Berlin are laden with unexploded munitions, further complicating a dangerous task Firefighters in Germany are battling to subdue one of the largest forest fires in recent decades, around 50km (30 miles) south of Berlin. The blaze spread overnight on Thursday to an area equivalent to 500 football pitches. Fire crews, many of them volunteers, had their work complicated by the presence of unexploded munitions, which litter the forests around Berlin. Hundreds of people have been evacuated from homes menaced by the fire. Authorities said 540 from three villages were moved to safer places, mostly emergency accommodation. Blazes near the village of Treuenbrietzen were targeted by helicopters dropping water from above. Police water cannon have also been deployed. Flames came within 100m (328ft) of homes in some areas, Reuters reports ""I have huge respect for the firefighters who are out there right now, risking their lives,"" local politician GÃ¼nter Baaske said. ""We know there is ammunition lying around in the forest."" The munitions are believed to date from the Soviet Army's actions in the former East Germany, during World War Two. Mr Baaske added that some explosions had been heard. How wildfires start and how to stop them Why wildfires are breaking out in the 'wrong' countries The photos that explain the world's wildfires Authorities have said the fire is now under control, but that it may take days to fully extinguish. A pall of smoke hangs over the forest area, and the German capital beyond it The blaze is believed to have been started deliberately. The BBC's Berlin Correspondent Jenny Hill reports that people living in the capital were told to close their doors and windows because of a cloud of smoke hanging over the city. So far, air traffic to and from Berlin remains unaffected.

"The forests around Berlin are laden with unexploded munitions, further complicating a dangerous task Firefighters in Germany are battling to subdue one of the largest forest fires in recent decades, around 50km (30 miles) south of Berlin. The blaze spread overnight on Thursday to an area equivalent to 500 football pitches. Fire crews, many of them volunteers, had their work complicated by the presence of unexploded munitions, which litter the forests around Berlin. Hundreds of people have been evacuated from homes menaced by the fire. Authorities said 540 from three villages were moved to safer places, mostly emergency accommodation. Blazes near the village of Treuenbrietzen were targeted by helicopters dropping water from above. Police water cannon have also been deployed. Flames came within 100m (328ft) of homes in some areas, Reuters reports ""I have huge respect for the firefighters who are out there right now, risking their lives,"" local politician GÃ¼nter Baaske said. ""We know there is ammunition lying around in the forest."" The munitions are believed to date from the Soviet Army's actions in the former East Germany, during World War Two. Mr Baaske added that some explosions had been heard. How wildfires start and how to stop them Why wildfires are breaking out in the 'wrong' countries The photos that explain the world's wildfires Authorities have said the fire is now under control, but that it may take days to fully extinguish. A pall of smoke hangs over the forest area, and the German capital beyond it The blaze is believed to have been started deliberately. The BBC's Berlin Correspondent Jenny Hill reports that people living in the capital were told to close their doors and windows because of a cloud of smoke hanging over the city. So far, air traffic to and from Berlin remains unaffected.

"Misa Matsushima's childhood dream of being a fighter pilot was inspired by the 1986 US film Top Gun A Japanese woman will be flying through the glass ceiling as she becomes her country's first female fighter pilot. First Lieutenant Misa Matsushima, 26, will begin duty on Friday having completed her training to fly F-15s, Japan's military has announced. ""As the first female (fighter) pilot, I will open the way,"" she told reporters. Japan's air force began recruiting women in 1993 - except as fighter jet and reconnaissance aircraft pilots. It lifted that final ban in late 2015. ""Ever since I saw the movie Top Gun when I was in primary school, I have always admired fighter jet pilots,"" the graduate of Japan's National Defence Academy told journalists. ""I wish to continue to work hard to fulfil my duty - not just for myself but also for women who will follow this path in the future."" The first Indian woman to fly a fighter jet Pakistani female fighter pilot killed The air force pilot who took her baby on missions Three other women are currently training to join the elite group of fighter pilots. The F-15J fighter jets they will pilot are twin-engine aircrafts designed for air-to-air combat with other jets. They can reach top speeds of about Mach 2.5 - 2.5 times the speed of sound or about 3,000 km/h (1,864 miles/h). ""The first female fighter pilot of the Air Self-Defence Force is born,"" a tweet (in Japanese) from the Japan Air Self-Defence Force said. Allow Twitter content?

The 26-year-old had planned to fly transport planes before the final gender restriction on fighter pilots was lifted. Japan has high levels of gender inequality, with many women expected to become housewives rather than having a career. But faced with an aging population and shrinking workforce, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe pledged in 2013 to empower working women. The armed forces has taken on his ""womenomics"" policy by planning to increase the number of women serving in the 228,000-strong air, sea and ground troops from the current 6.1% to 9% by 2030. Earlier this year, Ryoko Azuma became the first woman to command a warship squadron. ""I don't think about being a woman.I will concentrate my energy on fulfilling my duties as commander,"" the 44-year-old said at the time, according to local media,external. Has 'womenomics' worked in Japan? Female first-aiders ordered from sumo ring China girls barred from 'boys' jobs' What can Saudi women still not do? When she joined the country's maritime self-defence force in 1996, women were not allowed to serve on warships. That ban was lifted a decade ago, but women are still barred from serving on submarines. Breaking through Japan's male-dominated workplace remains a huge challenge in different fields, such as the corporate world where women face difficulties rising up the ranks. Women are also still banned from competing professionally in Japan's national sport, sumo wrestling. Despite the prime minister's efforts to improve the position of women in the workplace, the nation dropped from 111th to 114th in 2017's global gender equality rankings, according to the World Economic Forum.

"Every school, college and university in Scotland is to provide free sanitary products under a new Â£5.2m Scottish government scheme. The launch of the scheme coincides with the start of the new academic year. It follows a pilot programme in Aberdeen, while funding has also allowed free availability in some areas to women on low incomes. The government said the funding aimed to help ""banish the scourge of period poverty"" among pupils and students. A recent survey of more than 2,000 people by Young Scot found that about one in four respondents at school, college or university in Scotland had struggled to access sanitary products. Council offers free sanitary products 'Time is right' to end period poverty Ministers urged to lead the way on period poverty UK girls ""too poor"" to afford tampons The Scottish government worked on the new scheme with bodies including the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities (Cosla), Colleges Scotland, Universities Scotland and the Scottish Funding Council. Communities Secretary Aileen Campbell said she was proud that Scotland was taking ""world-leading action to fight period poverty"" among the country's 395,000 pupils and students. She said: ""In a country as rich as Scotland, it's unacceptable that anyone should struggle to buy basic sanitary products. ""I welcome the support of local authorities, colleges and universities in implementing this initiative. ""Our Â£5.2m investment will mean these essential products will be available to those who need them in a sensitive and dignified way, which will make it easier for students to fully focus on their studies."" Scottish Labour MSP Monica Lennon, who has brought forward a Member's Bill calling for the Scottish government to provide free female sanitary products ""for anyone who needs them"", welcomed the move. She said: ""This is another great step forward in the campaign against period poverty. ""Access to period products should be a right, regardless of your income, which is why I am moving ahead with plans for legislation to introduce a universal system of free access to period products for everyone in Scotland. ""No-one should face the indignity of being unable to access these essential products to manage their period.""

"Derrick Peters was put up in the Park Grand hotel in Paddington after claiming to have lost his friend and all his possessions in the blaze A man who falsely claimed to be a Grenfell Tower resident to dodge a jail sentence will spend six years behind bars for his ""repulsive"" crimes. Derrick Peters, 58, stayed at the Park Grand hotel in Paddington after claiming he lost his friend and his possessions in the blaze on 14 June last year. Isleworth Crown Court heard he ran up a Â£40,000 bill at the Â£192-a-night room. He also spent up to Â£5,000 on food, drink and laundry at the hotel. What happened at Grenfell Tower? Grenfell Tower fraudster pleads guilty Peters, of no fixed abode, was arrested in August last year after burgling a nearby flat, stealing jewellery and other items worth around Â£3,000. The Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea continued to pay for his hotel room for two months while he was held on remand in Wandsworth prison. He was handed a community order after repeating his Grenfell lies during his sentencing on 16 October. The judge, who had no reason to doubt his story, said: ""How on earth can one even begin to understand what it is like to lose a friend in a tragedy like Grenfell?"" Peters continued the pretence and was even offered a flat meant for genuine victims of the disaster that left 72 people dead. However, his story unravelled after Rebecca Ross, a Grenfell survivor whose father Steve Power perished in the fire, confirmed Peters had not lived with them and their three dogs, as he had claimed. Peters pleaded guilty to perverting the court of justice and two counts of fraud and was sentenced to six years in jail on Friday. He was also re-sentenced for the original burglary charge. Judge Robin Johnson told Peters he was sure he had been previously spared jail because of his ""brazen lie"" to the judge. ""It was designed to pull heart strings. It succeeded, just as the similar lies were providing you with hotel accommodation and money,"" he said. ""Your conduct from June last year was utterly disgraceful. You cheated and lied for your own ends, trading on others' misery. There can be little mercy in such a case."" The judge said Peters' crimes had reached ""such depths as any right-minded member of the public would find repulsive"". The court heard Peters has been convicted of 90 offences, including 24 for fraud and 49 for theft. He is the sixth person to be sentenced for fraud relating to the Grenfell fire and received the longest prison term yet.

"The 2008 attack left Piper with permanent scars Model and campaigner Katie Piper has said she is ""trying to come to terms with the decision"" to release her acid attacker after nine years in jail. ""This is a really difficult time for me,""she told fans,external, saying it was ""something I need to deal with"". Stefan Sylvestre received a life sentence in 2009 after throwing sulphuric acid at Piper's face on the orders of her former partner. Piper is currently rehearsing for this year's series of Strictly Come Dancing. Writing on Twitter, the 34-year-old said she felt it was ""important"" to send a message to her ""friends, supporters and followers"". Participating in Strictly, she went on, had given her ""a welcome and positive distraction"" from her past. ""Whilst there is never a good time to hear this news, I am glad I have this new journey to concentrate on,"" she wrote. Who is in Strictly Come Dancing 2018? Sylvestre, now 30, was told in 2009 he would have to serve a minimum of six years before he would be eligible for parole. His attack on Piper in March 2008, carried out at the behest of her obsessive ex-boyfriend Daniel Lynch, left her with horrific injuries and permanent scarring. Stefan Sylvestre was 19 when he carried out the attack The Parole Board's decision summary said Sylvestre's case was considered at an oral hearing and that Piper had read statements in person to the panel. ""The panel took full account of the content of these statements and the supporting documentation,"" its summary said. It said that Sylvestre, who was 19 at the time of the attack, had ""displayed empathy for the victim and expressed remorse and shame for his actions"". It said he had avoided anti-social behaviour while imprisoned, had ""repaired his relationship"" with his family and had ""completed relevant offence-focused work to challenge and change his attitude and thinking"". Carrying acid could lead to jail term A spokesman for the Ministry of Justice offered its ""heartfelt sympathies"" to Piper but said Sylvestre's release was a matter for the Parole Board. Sylvestre became eligible to be considered for release in April 2014 and had a previous review by the Parole Board in 2015. Lynch was jailed for life in 2009 with a minimum of 16 years for sexually assaulting Piper and telling Sylvestre to throw acid over her.

"This video can not be played Scott Morrison tells reporters he plans to unite the party and the country Scott Morrison has become Australia's new prime minister after Malcolm Turnbull was forced out by party rivals in a bruising leadership contest. Mr Turnbull had been under pressure from poor polling and what he described as an ""insurgency"" by conservative MPs. Mr Morrison, the treasurer, won an internal ballot 45-40 over former Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton - who had been Mr Turnbull's most vocal threat. Mr Turnbull is the fourth Australian PM in a decade to be ousted by colleagues. ""It has been such a privilege to be the leader of this great nation. I love Australia. I love Australians,"" he said on Friday. A PM felled by revolts and revenge ""Who needs Game of Thrones?"" - Australians react to political chaos This video can not be played Can anyone hang on to Australia's top job? With an election looming, MPs were nervous about the government's poor opinion polling and recent by-election defeats. Last week,a row over energy policyignited long-existing tensions between Mr Turnbull, a moderate, and his party's conservative wing. Mr Dutton, a conservative, then unsuccessfully challenged Mr Turnbullon Tuesday, but his narrow defeat only stoked further discord. Mr Morrison entered the race after Mr Turnbull lost key backers. After a majority of MPs called for a leadership ""spill"", Mr Turnbull agreed to step down. To further complicate matters, Mr Turnbull has signalled he would resign from parliament, which would force a by-election and potentially put the government's one-seat majority at risk and force the new premier to call early elections. However, Mr Morrison, who was sworn in on Friday, told reporters there were no plans to do this any time soon. His government, he said, would be in place by next week. Mr Morrison, a former Tourism Australia official, entered parliament in 2007 and has since held three key ministerial portfolios. A social conservative who appeals to the moderate elements of the Liberal party Rose to national prominence as immigration minister in Tony Abbott's government Built a reputation as a tough operator in enforcing Australia's hardline ""stop the boats"" policy Drew criticism over the controversial asylum seeker policiesand offshore detention centres Seen as a pragmatic, ambitious politician who has long eyed the top job The 50-year old father-of-two is a leading religious conservativeand opposed last year's same-sex marriage bill. Speaking to reporters after the vote on Friday, Mr Morrison said he would be working to ""bring our party back together which has been bruised and battered this week"" and bring the country together. He also said dealing with a severe drought, which has hit parts of eastern Australia, would be ""our most urgent and pressing need right now"". The rise of Scott Morrison, Australia's new PM With a mixture of bemusement, anger and sheer frustration: many have described this week as one of the most chaotic in Australian political history. This video can not be played How the party turned on Malcolm Turnbull In his final press briefing, Mr Turnbull called the week ""madness"" and thanked his colleagues for choosing Mr Morrison over Mr Dutton. ""We have so much going for us in this country. We have to be proud of it and cherish it,"" he said. Six moments that defined Turnbull as PM Coup capital of the democratic world The ex-cop who tried to oust Australia's PM Mr Dutton said: ""My course from here is to provide absolute loyalty to Scott Morrison, and make sure we win the election."" Foreign Minister Julie Bishop was also in the running for the leadership, but did not make it to the final round. Hywel Griffith, BBC News in Canberra So Australia has its 30th prime minister, but how long before the 31st? Scott Morrison faces an enormous task not just in healing the wounds within his party, but in winning the forgiveness of the public. Many Australians have watched on exasperated, as normal government business was suspended to settle a political feud. Given that an election must be called by May, Mr Morrison's biggest challenge will be convincing the electorate that he should stay in power. If he doesn't succeed, expect yet another PM by June. The past decade has been marked by a series of leadership coups, with three other sitting prime ministers deposed by party rivals. Not a single leader in recent times has succeeded in serving a full term as prime minister, partly because elections come around so often - every three years - two years less than in the UK. So in recent years, prime ministers unpopular in the polls - or with their colleagues - have been swiftly sacrificed from within. Dave Sharma, a former Australian diplomat, says ""an election is always just around the corner, meaning members of parliament are forever focused on their electoral survival - and less so on the national interest"". Four reasons why Australian politics is so crazy Writing in the Sydney Morning Herald,Mr Sharma says ""the steady drip of opinion polls and the relentless media cycle exacerbates the short-termism"",external. Under the Australian system, as in the UK, the prime minister is not directly elected by voters but is the leader of the party or coalition that can command a majority in parliament.

"The cast of Love Island 2018 included models and beauty consultants ITV's digital controller has defended Love Island's lack of body diversity - describing the show as ""aspirational"". Speaking at the Edinburgh TV festival, Paul Mortimer said producers deliberately showed the cast exercising to get the bodies they have. He added they ""make no excuses"" about having a cast of attractive people on the show. ""There's also another conversation going on about childhood obesity,"" Mortimer said. ""If you want to look like the guys on Love Island you have to work out."" Love Island finalists Megan and Wes He continued: ""I think on the body image thing, we cast very attractive people, it's a sexy show. ""It is entertainment on ITV2 and in the same way Hollywood casts a certain type to get bums on seats in theatres or other shows. ""For us it's a very aspirational programme for our audience.

"As Scottish first minister and leader of the Scottish National Party, Alex Salmond has been the most high-profile figure in the independence movement. He took the SNP closer to its central aim than it had ever been, but after the ""No"" vote in September's referendum Mr Salmond decided to stand down. So, how did Mr Salmond go from brash political outsider to international statesman? Born on Hogmanay 1954 in the ancient burgh of Linlithgow, Alexander Elliot Anderson Salmond graduated from St Andrews University and began a career in economics, working for the Scottish Office and the Royal Bank of Scotland. He also played an increasingly active role in the Scottish National Party, having come to the conclusion that the economic case for independence was strong. Mr Salmond's rise to prominence came as the SNP fell on hard times, triggered by Margaret Thatcher's 1979 Conservative election win, which saw the number of Nationalist MPs slashed from 11 to two. He played a prominent role in the breakaway '79 Group, which sought to sharpen the SNP's message and appeal to dissident Labour voters - a move which earned him a brief expulsion from the party in 1982. Reflecting on the incident years later, he put it down in part to his being a ""brash young man"" - although the urge to cause a bit of mischief has never been far from his mind. Despite this episode, Mr Salmond established himself as a rising star of the SNP, winning the Westminster seat of Banff and Buchan in 1987 - and notably getting himself banned from the Commons chamber for a week after interrupting the chancellor's Budget speech in protest at the introduction of the poll tax in Scotland. When the SNP leadership job came up in 1990, Mr Salmond grabbed the opportunity and, on winning the post, repositioned the party as more socially democratic and pro-European. Scottish devolution was an opportunity for the SNP. The party failed to win the first Holyrood election in 1999, but gained enough seats to become the main opposition. During the campaign, Mr Salmond had sparked controversy when he described Nato action in Kosovo as ""an act of dubious legality, but, above all, one of unpardonable folly"". After putting in a decade as SNP leader, Mr Salmond decided to quit, standing down as an MSP and returning to Westminster. During his time in London, Mr Salmond had a visible profile, partly from appearances on TV shows such as Question Time, Have I got News for You and Channel 4's Morning Line, where his horse racing expertise saw him offering tips and insights. John Swinney took over the reins as SNP leader from Mr Salmond, but stood down in 2004 following continued criticism from sections of the party and the negative publicity of a leadership challenge. Many turned to Mr Salmond to grasp the thistle and take his old job back. He responded by quoting Union Army General William Sherman, who, on being asked to run for president following the American Civil War, declared: ""If nominated I'll decline. If drafted I'll defer. And if elected I'll resign."" As the leadership contest continued, with Roseanna Cunningham regarded as a front-runner, Mr Salmond made a surprise entry into the race, explaining: ""I changed my mind."" Following his leadership comeback, on a joint ticket with deputy Nicola Sturgeon, Mr Salmond led the SNP to what was then its greatest hour - victory at the 2007 Scottish election and delivery of a minority SNP government. The newly appointed first minister, who returned to Holyrood by winning the Liberal Democrat-held Gordon seat, soon had his first of many brushes with the UK government. The subject was the future of the convicted Lockerbie bomber Abdelbaset al-Megrahi, who was released by the Scottish government on compassionate grounds on account of his terminal illness, in the face of huge criticism from the US and others. In contrast, the Glasgow Airport terror attack and the foot and mouth crisis showed how willing the first minister was to work with Westminster on issues of UK importance. Scottish government policies such as protecting NHS spending, freezing council tax and scrapping bridge tolls and prescription charges were popular with voters. But critics questioned whether universal benefits were affordable, and accused SNP ministers of giving local authorities a raw deal. As the global economic meltdown took hold, Mr Salmond blamed ""spivs and speculators"" for the problems which caused the takeover of HBOS, as the crisis of confidence in the financial sector hit Scotland. He later faced criticism from political rivals who said HBOS's real problems were caused by the bank's exposure to the volatile mortgage market. On the day Fred Goodwin was stripped of his knighthood, Mr Salmond also reflected on a letter he previously wrote to the banker when he was running Royal Bank of Scotland, offering the Scottish government's assistance in the takeover of Dutch bank ABN-Amro - the deal which contributed to RBS needing a Â£45bn bailout. Looking back, Mr Salmond said very few people could have predicted the meltdown, adding: ""If we had the benefit of hindsight we'd do things differently and I am sure that is true of lots and lots of people."" The first minister has faced opposition accusations of close links with big businessmen, including the Stagecoach boss Brian Soutar, US tycoon Donald Trump - who later turned on Mr Salmond over his government's pro-wind farm policy - and media mogul Rupert Murdoch. Mr Salmond always insisted relations with such figures were about promoting jobs for Scotland. Mr Salmond's hopes of increasing the number of SNP MPs in a hung UK parliament in 2010 with the purpose of ""making Westminster dance to a Scottish jig"" didn't quite come off. With a resurgent Tory party on course for victory, Scots voters came out in their droves to back Labour, during a campaign which saw the SNP unsuccessfully take the BBC to court, after it was decided Mr Salmond couldn't debate with Gordon Brown, Nick Clegg and David Cameron on TV. Despite the result, the first minister came to regard a Tory-led Westminster government as a key argument for independence, by invoking memories of Thatcher (and poking fun at the Conservatives' single Scottish MP). It seemed Labour was on course to win the 2011 Scottish election, but Mr Salmond - never to be underestimated - launched into the contest with a positive campaign. When he came up against Labour's negative, attacking style, Scots voters decided there was no contest - and the SNP was returned with a jaw-dropping landslide win. Holyrood's part-proportional representation/part-constituency system was essentially designed to keep any one party (ie the SNP) from winning an overall majority - but the nationalists' victory brought about a generational shift in Scottish politics, which had seen Labour as the dominant force for 50 years. The Salmond Administration V2.0 continued as Scotland's devolved government, pledging to resist Westminster cuts and protect cherished universal benefits, while claiming achievements such as cutting crime to a 30-year low. Opposition parties regularly argued the first minister was becoming so obsessed with his dream of independence that he'd taken his eye off the ball when it came to Scotland's needs. Mr Salmond's critics also claimed falling teacher and nursing numbers, and housing shortages, were examples of a lax attitude. Mr Salmond didn't bring forward his government's promised Referendum Bill in its first term because it lacked the necessary votes in Holyrood - possibly a blessing in disguise, given the polls were indicating a ""No"" outcome at the time. The 2011 election result made the independence referendum a certainty - and it was time for Mr Salmond to put his money (and North Sea oil reserves) where his mouth was. The first minister, along with his government and the wider independence movement, set out a vision of Scotland's as one of the world's richest small nations - with opponents arguing he was willing to say anything to win a ""Yes"" vote. But on the night it wasn't to be, as voters rejected independence by 55% to 45% in the 18 September vote. The following day, Mr Salmond announced he was standing down as first minister and SNP leader - but not before delivering a warning to his opponents to make good on their promise to increase the powers of the devolved Scottish Parliament. His long-term deputy Nicola Sturgeon replaced Mr Salmond at the top of the SNP in November 2014. Soon after that Mr Salmond announced he intended to return to Westminster, standing as the SNP candidate for Gordon in the 2015 May election. He won the seat and was appointed as the SNP's foreign affairs spokesman in the House of Commons. However, his time at Westminster was cut short by the snap election called by Prime Minister Theresa May for June 2017. He was the most high-profile of several SNP MPs to lose their seats, suffering his first defeat as a candidate in any parliamentary election since entering Westminster in 1987. The Alex Salmond Show began broadcasting in November last year During the summer after he lost his Westminster seat, he hosted a sell-out run of his Alex Salmond Unleashed show at the Edinburgh Fringe, in which he chatted with guests such as Elaine C Smith. His fortnight at the Fringe was good practice for the TV show he began in November 2017 on the RT channel. Critics claimed that RT was a Russian propaganda channel but Mr Salmond urged viewers to judge for themselves. Opponents accused the former Scottish first minister of being a ""useful idiot for the Kremlin"". But Mr Salmond insisted that the state-funded channel was not propaganda and he had never been told what to say. Despite his public profile, Mr Salmond and wife Moira, closely protect their private lives. He is also known for his fondness for singing, horse racing and (like many Scots) curries.

"The tunnel is suspected to have been used to shuffle drugs from Mexico into the US US authorities have found a secret drug tunnel stretching from a former KFC in the state of Arizona to Mexico. The 600ft (180m) passageway was in the basement of the old restaurant in San Luis, leading under the border to a home in San Luis Rio Colorado. Authorities made the discovery last week and have arrested the southern Arizona building's owner.

Investigators say the containers held more than 118kg (260lb) of methamphetamine, 6kg of cocaine, 3kg of fentanyl, and 19kg of heroin. Agents searched Lopez's home and his old KFC, discovering the tunnel's entrance in the kitchen of the former fast-food joint. The tunnel led from an old KFC restaurant to a home in Mexico A video showing the tunnel walls The passageway was 22ft deep, 5ft tall and 3ft wide, and ended at a trap door under a bed in a home in Mexico, said US officials. The drugs are believed to have been pulled up through the tunnel with a rope. This is not the first such discovery - two years ago a 2,600ft tunnel was found by authorities in San Diego, California. Authorities said it was one of the longest such drug tunnels ever discovered, used to transport an ""unprecedented cache"" of cocaine and marijuana. In July alone, US Border Patrol seized 15kg of heroin, 24lbs of cocaine, 327kg of methamphetamine and 1,900kg of marijuana at border checkpoints nationwide.

"Mr Salmond was first minister of Scotland between 2007 and 2014 The former Scottish first minister, Alex Salmond, has described sexual misconduct allegations against him as ""patently ridiculous"". The claims date back to December 2013, when Mr Salmond was still in office, according to theDaily Record.,external In a statement, he said he was taking the Scottish government to court to challenge the complaints procedure which had been activated against him. The Scottish government said it would ""defend its position vigorously"". And it said it was vital that any allegations of harassment were treated seriously and investigated thoroughly, regardless of who was said to have been involved. Alex Salmond profile The Daily Record said Mr Salmond was reported to police over allegations he sexually assaulted two staff members at the first minister's official residence at Bute House in Edinburgh in December 2013. A Police Scotland spokesman said the force was ""not going to comment on whether an inquiry is ongoing."" Mr Salmond, who had two spells as leader of the pro-independence SNP, led the devolved Scottish government as first minister from 2007. He quit in the aftermath of the independence referendum in 2014, when Scotland voted to remain in the United Kingdom. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

In his statement, Mr Salmond says he refutes all of the allegations against him. He did not say what the claims were, but described some of them as being ""patently ridiculous"". He also said that ""on the advice of Senior Counsel"" he had been complaining to the Scottish government's permanent secretary, Leslie Evans, that the complaints procedure was ""unjust"" and ""unlawful"". The permanent secretary isresponsible for the Scottish government's 5,000 civil servants,external, and is the principal policy advisor to Nicola Sturgeon, who succeeded Mr Salmond as first minister and SNP leader. Mr Salmond said: ""Even now I have not been allowed to see and therefore to properly challenge the case against me. ""I have not been allowed to see the evidence. I have tried everything, including offers of conciliation, mediation and legal arbitration to resolve these matters both properly and amicably. ""This would have been in everybody's interests, particularly those of the two complainants. All of these efforts have been rejected."" Mr Salmond has hosted a show on the controversial RT station since last November Leader of Scottish National Party 1990-2000 and 2004-2014 First Minister of Scotland 2007 - 2014 Stood down after Scotland voted to remain in the United Kingdom Mr Salmond said that ""with great reluctance"" he had launched a judicial review against the Scottish government at the Court of Session. He said that if he lost the case he would have to answer to the complaints against him ""both comprehensively and publicly"". But he warned that ""the administration at the senior levels of the Scottish government will have the most serious questions to answer"" if the court finds in his favour. This will send shockwaves through the country, not just the political bubble that Alex Salmond has operated in for many decades. The story broke just after 10 o'clock last night, when Mr Salmond released a statement on his social media sites in response to a story in the Daily Record newspaper. The headline from the statement is extraordinary enough - he is going to take the Scottish government to court, which given that he used to head that government is a remarkable development. But it's even more extraordinary when you consider the reasons why. Mr Salmond has decided to challenge the Scottish government's complaints procedure after two people, according to Mr Salmond, lodged complaints against him. He also says that he intends to give media interviews, perhaps as early as today. Responding to his statement, a Scottish government spokesman said: ""We can confirm that Alex Salmond has initiated legal proceedings against the Scottish government and as a result we are restricted in what we can say. ""However, the Scottish government will defend its position vigorously. As a matter of principle and integrity, it is vital that any allegations of harassment are treated seriously and investigated thoroughly, regardless of the identity of the party involved."" Mr Salmond was elected as the SNP MP for Gordon in 2015 before losing the seat in the snap general election two years later. He has faced heavy criticism for hosting the Alex Salmond Show on Russian broadcaster RT, which has been described as a propaganda channel for the Kremlin - a claim Mr Salmond has denied.

"A Cardiff statue of NHS founder, Aneurin Bevan, has been fitted with plastic spikes to stop birds pooing on its head. The 15ft (4.5m) high statue has been used as a loo by pigeons and seagulls. The statue has stood proudly at Cardiff's Queen Street for more than 30 years. Supporters launched a campaign to make him appear more healthy - and officials came up with the three rows of spikes. Pigeon poop unlucky for university Bear statue 'must go' after 'road scare' Â£15k Elf statue stolen in Crickhowell Former nurse Carys Thomas, 43, said: ""Never mind the National Health Service, Nye needs a bash-a-gull health service to keep the birds off. ""He is meant to look strong and proud not covered in bird poo."" The spikes aim to stop sights like this. Council officers were called on to help protect the historic statue to mark the 70th anniversary of the NHS. Cardiff councillor Keith Jones said: ""We have people coming here from all over the world and the statue itself is world renowned. ""Residents have complained about it and the business community themselves have concerns about the state of it. ""The current state is just not good enough by anyone's criteria.

"Just one drink a day leads to health risks Bad news for those who enjoy what they think is a healthy glass of wine a day. A large new global study published in the Lancet has confirmed previous research which has shown that there is no safe level of alcohol consumption. The researchers admit moderate drinking may protect against heart disease but found that the risk of cancer and other diseases outweighs these protections. A study author said its findings were the most significant to date because of the range of factors considered. TheGlobal Burden of Disease,externalstudy looked at levels of alcohol use and its health effects in 195 countries, including the UK, between 1990 and 2016. Analysing data from 15 to 95-year-olds, the researchers compared people who did not drink at all with those who had one alcoholic drink a day. They found that out of 100,000 non-drinkers, 914 would develop an alcohol-related health problem such as cancer or suffer an injury. But an extra four people would be affected if they drank one alcoholic drink a day. For people who had two alcoholic drinks a day, 63 more developed a condition within a year and for those who consumed five drinks every day, there was an increase of 338 people, who developed a health problem. One of the study authors, Prof Sonia Saxena, a researcher at Imperial College London and a practising GP, said: ""One drink a day does represent a small increased risk, but adjust that to the UK population as a whole and it represents a far bigger number, and most people are not drinking just one drink a day."" A glass of red wine a day is not healthy, say researchers The lead author of the study Dr Max Griswold, at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME), University of Washington, said: ""Previous studies have found a protective effect of alcohol on some conditions, but we found that the combined health risks associated with alcohol increases with any amount of alcohol. ""The strong association between alcohol consumption and the risk of cancer, injuries, and infectious diseases offset the protective effects for heart disease in our study. ""Although the health risks associated with alcohol start off being small with one drink a day, they then rise rapidly as people drink more."" Booze calculator: What's your drinking nationality? Alcohol limits cut to reduce risks Does moderate drinking prevent dementia? Six charts on how the British drink In 2016, the government cut the levels of alcohol it recommends for men and women to no more than 14 units a week - equivalent to six pints of average strength beer or seven glasses of wine. At the time, England's chief medical officer, Prof Dame Sally Davies, noted that any amount of alcohol could increase the risk of cancer. Prof Saxena said the study was the most important study ever conducted on the subject. She explained: ""This study goes further than others by considering a number of factors including alcohol sales, self-reported data on the amount of alcohol drunk, abstinence, tourism data and the levels of illicit trade and home brewing."" The study shows that British women drink an average of three drinks a day, and rank eighth in the world of highest drinkers. British men by contrast, ranked 62nd out of the 195 countries surveyed, even though they also drink on average three alcoholic drinks a day. This is because the drinking levels were far higher generally among men, with Romanian men drinking more than eight drinks daily. A drink was defined as 10g of alcohol, which equates to a small glass of wine, a can or bottle of beer, or a shot of spirits.  In the UK one unit is 8g of alcohol. Around the world, one in three people are thought to drink alcohol and it is linked to nearly a tenth of all deaths in those aged 15 to 49. Prof Saxena said: ""Most of us in the UK drink well in excess of safe limits, and as this study shows there is no safe limit. The recommendations need to come down further and the government needs to rethink its policy. If you are going to drink, educate yourself about the risks, and take an informed risk."" Large glass of wine - 3 units Pint of higher-strength lager or beer - 3 units Standard glass of wine - 2 units Pint of lower-strength lager or beer - 2 units Bottle of lager or beer - 1.7 units Single shot of spirits - 1 unit Source:NHS Choices,external Yet Prof David Spiegelhalter, Winton Professor for the Public Understanding of Risk at the University of Cambridge, sounded a note of caution about the findings. ""Given the pleasure presumably associated with moderate drinking, claiming there is no 'safe' level does not seem an argument for abstention,"" he said. ""There is no safe level of driving, but the government does not recommend that people avoid driving. ""Come to think of it, there is no safe level of living, but nobody would recommend abstention.""

"Every school, college and university in Scotland is to provide free sanitary products under a new Â£5.2m Scottish government scheme. The launch of the scheme coincides with the start of the new academic year. It follows a pilot programme in Aberdeen, while funding has also allowed free availability in some areas to women on low incomes. The government said the funding aimed to help ""banish the scourge of period poverty"" among pupils and students. A recent survey of more than 2,000 people by Young Scot found that about one in four respondents at school, college or university in Scotland had struggled to access sanitary products. Council offers free sanitary products 'Time is right' to end period poverty Ministers urged to lead the way on period poverty UK girls ""too poor"" to afford tampons The Scottish government worked on the new scheme with bodies including the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities (Cosla), Colleges Scotland, Universities Scotland and the Scottish Funding Council. Communities Secretary Aileen Campbell said she was proud that Scotland was taking ""world-leading action to fight period poverty"" among the country's 395,000 pupils and students. She said: ""In a country as rich as Scotland, it's unacceptable that anyone should struggle to buy basic sanitary products. ""I welcome the support of local authorities, colleges and universities in implementing this initiative. ""Our Â£5.2m investment will mean these essential products will be available to those who need them in a sensitive and dignified way, which will make it easier for students to fully focus on their studies."" Scottish Labour MSP Monica Lennon, who has brought forward a Member's Bill calling for the Scottish government to provide free female sanitary products ""for anyone who needs them"", welcomed the move. She said: ""This is another great step forward in the campaign against period poverty. ""Access to period products should be a right, regardless of your income, which is why I am moving ahead with plans for legislation to introduce a universal system of free access to period products for everyone in Scotland. ""No-one should face the indignity of being unable to access these essential products to manage their period.""

"This video can not be played Jacob Rees-Mogg told BBC Newsnight that the Treasury was in a ""Brexit panic"" Brexiteers have attacked Philip Hammond for reiterating a warning that a ""no-deal"" Brexit could damage the economy. The chancellor's warning was publishedin a letter,external, hours after the government laid out plans for a""no-deal"" Brexit. Conservative MP Marcus Fysh accused Mr Hammond of embarking on ""another instalment of dodgy project fear"". Meanwhile, the World Trade Organization head has told the BBC no deal ""would not be the end of the world... but it's not going to be a walk in the park"". In a letter published on the Treasury website, Mr Hammond repeated the findings of the Treasury's provisional Brexit analysis released earlier this year. What do the Brexit 'no deal' papers reveal? Reality Check: What would 'no deal' look like? That analysis includes a warning that a ""no-deal"" Brexit could mean a 7.7% hit to GDP over the next 15 years, compared with the ""status quo baseline"". Writing to Nicky Morgan, chairwoman of the treasury committee, he said that under a ""no-deal"" scenario chemicals, food and drink, clothing, manufacturing, cars and retail would be the sectors ""most affected negatively in the long run"". He added that the largest negative impacts would be felt ""in the north-east [of England] and Northern Ireland"". The letter also said Treasury analysis estimated borrowing would be around Â£80bn a year higher under a ""no-deal"" scenario by 2033. Mr Hammond added that this analysis was now ""undergoing a process of refinement"" and emphasised that a ""no-deal"" Brexit was not the government's preferred option and that it was ""confident of a agreeing a good deal"". How a no-deal Brexit could affect Britain, according to the government's advice The timing of the letter was criticised, coming so soon after Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab sought to play down the risk of no deal - describing the impact as a ""potential short-term disruption"". Prominent Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg, who has written to all Tory local associations urging them to reject the PM's Chequers deal, said leaving on WTO terms was not ""as absurdly frightening as the chancellor of the exchequer thinks it may be"". ""As a dog returneth to his vomit, so a fool returneth to his folly,"" he said. ""The naysayers in the Treasury have consistently wanted to paint a bleak picture because they are frightened of taking responsibility for managing the economy without the crutch of the EU. It is a sign of their weakness. ""What Mr Hammond is doing is a reminder of why no-one believes the politicised forecasts of the Treasury. The Treasury is desperate to stop Brexit. Everything the Treasury does has to be read in this light."" But Tory MP Sarah Wollaston, who backs a new referendum on the outcome of the Brexit negotiations, said Mr Hammond's comments were timely and they complemented, rather than contradicted, the no-deal analysis. She told BBC Radio 4's Today that Mr Rees-Mogg, who chairs the European Research Group (ERG) of Tory MPs, held too much sway in the party and the ""ERG tail is wagging the Conservative dog"". Cabinet Office minister David Lidington said there was ""nothing new"" in the chancellor's comments, telling Today that it was ""clear"" that leaving the EU without an agreement was ""not a desirable outcome"". Asked whether he agreed with his colleague Liam Fox, who claimed earlier this month the odds were 60:40 in favour of a ""no-deal"" exit, Mr Lidington said he was not a betting man but the odds of a deal were ""good"". ""We have to do the emergency 'no-deal' planning but it is not in our interests we end up in that position."" Shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said: ""A 'no-deal' Brexit has never been viable and would represent a complete failure of the government's negotiating strategy."" Please upgrade your browser Roberto Azevedo, the director-general of the WTO, said there would be an impact from a ""no-deal"" Brexit, with the possibility of trade ""barriers"" at the borders and tariffs between the UK and the EU almost certain. ""The EU cannot discriminate amongst the WTO members, so the UK will have to be treated as all the other members, and the other members pay tariffs so the UK will have to pay tariffs as well,"" he said. He was also asked whether the UK could unilaterally remove its trade tariffs. ""Technically, yes,"" he replied. ""But not only to the EU, to everybody, so you cannot pick and choose to whom you lower your tariffs. ""If you decide that a particular product, let's say glasses, that they go down to zero, that's perfectly right, any member of the WTO can do that. But that zero applies to everyone else.""

"Ryanair is tightening the rules on what passengers pay to take luggage onto the plane, in order to ""speed up boarding"". From November, passengers will still be allowed to take one ""small personal bag"" into the cabin, as long as it will fit under the seat in front. But they will have to pay Â£6 if they also want to take a 10kg bag, such as a pull-along suitcase, on board. And they'll still have to pay up to Â£10 if they want to check that bag into the hold instead. The move is not aimed at making money,the airline said,external, but was intended to ""improve punctuality and reduce boarding gate delays"". Under the new policy only 95 passengers per flight - around half of the total - will be permitted to pay for the right to take the extra bag on board. Other travellers will have to pay Â£8 to Â£10 for their 10kg bag to go into the hold. Larger checked-in luggage will still cost Â£25 per bag. It is the second time in a year that Ryanair has altered its cabin luggage policy. Rival airlines such as Easyjet, Wizz and Norwegian allow one piece of free hand luggage in the cabin on short-haul flights. Ryanair pilots 'reach deal to end strike' Ryanair compensation cheques 'bounced' Ryanair invests $200m in Luton Airport Ryanair said it was increasing the size of the small carry on bag that remains free to take on board to 20 litres. Kenny Jacobs, Ryanair's chief marketing officer, said the new policy ""will speed up boarding and cut flight delays"" by encouraging people to either travel very light with just one small bag, or to check-in a medium-sized bag. Currently Ryanair allows customers a small personal bag, and passengers who have paid for priority boarding can take a 10kg bag into the cabin as well. Those without priority boarding currently take pull-along bags and other medium-sized luggage with them until they board at the gate - at which point bags are transferred to the hold free of charge, which means passengers can take two bags without paying extra fees. But Ryanair said this policy was causing delays. From November, if passengers turn up at the boarding gate with more than the 20 litre carry-on bag but haven't paid for the priority boarding status, the bag will be placed in the hold at a charge of Â£25, Ryanair said.

"Hurricane Lane has been downgraded to a tropical storm as it churns towards Hawaii, but is still causing flash flooding and landslides. Schools and offices were closed as residents took shelter from the storm, which pummelled the US state with strong winds and torrential rain. But Hawaii looks was spared its first direct hit by a major storm in 25 years. President Donald Trump earlier declared a state of emergency for the state. The White House said federal authorities were on standby to provide support and supplies to local and state emergency response efforts. The Central Pacific Hurricane Center said early on Friday afternoon Hurricane Lane was ""weakening quickly"", with sustained winds of 85 mph (137km/h). By 17:00 local time (03:00 GMT Saturday), the sustained wind speed had dropped to 70 mph, although ""more flooding and damaging winds"" were expected on parts of the islands. Hawaii residents carry dogs to safety as Hurricane Lane has prompts evacuations throughout the island. Weather Service forecaster Leigh Anne Eaton said some parts of Big Island had already seen almost 3ft (90cm) or rain. Meanwhile, the National Weather Service said there had been ""catastrophic flooding"" and wind gusts reaching 67mph (108 kmph). Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) chief Brock Long took to Twitter to warn those in Hawaii to ""heed the warnings of local officials and stay aware of your surroundings"" until the danger had passed. An image from the Hawaiian Department of Transportation posted a photo of a landslide blocking a highway on the Big Island/ Amidst concerns of the approaching storm, emergency personnel responded to ""rapidly spreading"" brush fire in western Maui. The fire has prompted highway closures, power outages and precautionary evacuations. Lane was also forecast to cause dangerous surf heights of up to 25ft (7.6m) in Maui and Oahu. Officials warned of ""significant beach erosion"" and waves hitting coastal roadways. Meanwhile, United Airlines said it had cancelled all Friday flights to and from the main airports on Maui, the second-largest island. Hurricanes: A perfect storm of chance and climate change?

A member of staff at a local service station in Haleiwa, on the north shore of Oahu island, told AFP news agency that motorists had been ""constantly filling"" their vehicles. ""Everybody is in a panic mode right now, everyone is filling up gas, gas cans, propane cans,"" he said.

This video can not be played Tomasz Schafernaker has the latest forecast for Hurricane Lane Hawaii Governor David Ige urged residents to set aside supplies of water, food and medicines as a precaution and to avoid driving if possible. Dozens of evacuation centres were also set up throughout the day as Mr Trump urged Hawaiians to hunker down and prepare for the worst. According to NWS, only four named storms have made landfall in Hawaii since 1959 - and only two of those storms were hurricanes. Hawaii generally sees about one storm strong enough to earn a name pass within 60 miles of the islands every four years. Earlier this month, Hurricane Hector, a category four storm, also passed by the islands, though it did not come as close as Lane. The state has also seen serious volcanic eruptions this summer, withlava and ash spewing from the Kilauea volcanoon the Big Island since May.

Air swirls in to fill the low pressure in the storm, sucking air in and upwards, reinforcing the low pressure. The storm rotates due to the spin of the earth and energy from the warm ocean increases wind speeds as it builds.

"Ryanair is tightening the rules on what passengers pay to take luggage onto the plane, in order to ""speed up boarding"". From November, passengers will still be allowed to take one ""small personal bag"" into the cabin, as long as it will fit under the seat in front. But they will have to pay Â£6 if they also want to take a 10kg bag, such as a pull-along suitcase, on board. And they'll still have to pay up to Â£10 if they want to check that bag into the hold instead. The move is not aimed at making money,the airline said,external, but was intended to ""improve punctuality and reduce boarding gate delays"". Under the new policy only 95 passengers per flight - around half of the total - will be permitted to pay for the right to take the extra bag on board. Other travellers will have to pay Â£8 to Â£10 for their 10kg bag to go into the hold. Larger checked-in luggage will still cost Â£25 per bag. It is the second time in a year that Ryanair has altered its cabin luggage policy. Rival airlines such as Easyjet, Wizz and Norwegian allow one piece of free hand luggage in the cabin on short-haul flights. Ryanair pilots 'reach deal to end strike' Ryanair compensation cheques 'bounced' Ryanair invests $200m in Luton Airport Ryanair said it was increasing the size of the small carry on bag that remains free to take on board to 20 litres. Kenny Jacobs, Ryanair's chief marketing officer, said the new policy ""will speed up boarding and cut flight delays"" by encouraging people to either travel very light with just one small bag, or to check-in a medium-sized bag. Currently Ryanair allows customers a small personal bag, and passengers who have paid for priority boarding can take a 10kg bag into the cabin as well. Those without priority boarding currently take pull-along bags and other medium-sized luggage with them until they board at the gate - at which point bags are transferred to the hold free of charge, which means passengers can take two bags without paying extra fees. But Ryanair said this policy was causing delays. From November, if passengers turn up at the boarding gate with more than the 20 litre carry-on bag but haven't paid for the priority boarding status, the bag will be placed in the hold at a charge of Â£25, Ryanair said.

"Just one drink a day leads to health risks Bad news for those who enjoy what they think is a healthy glass of wine a day. A large new global study published in the Lancet has confirmed previous research which has shown that there is no safe level of alcohol consumption. The researchers admit moderate drinking may protect against heart disease but found that the risk of cancer and other diseases outweighs these protections. A study author said its findings were the most significant to date because of the range of factors considered. TheGlobal Burden of Disease,externalstudy looked at levels of alcohol use and its health effects in 195 countries, including the UK, between 1990 and 2016. Analysing data from 15 to 95-year-olds, the researchers compared people who did not drink at all with those who had one alcoholic drink a day. They found that out of 100,000 non-drinkers, 914 would develop an alcohol-related health problem such as cancer or suffer an injury. But an extra four people would be affected if they drank one alcoholic drink a day. For people who had two alcoholic drinks a day, 63 more developed a condition within a year and for those who consumed five drinks every day, there was an increase of 338 people, who developed a health problem. One of the study authors, Prof Sonia Saxena, a researcher at Imperial College London and a practising GP, said: ""One drink a day does represent a small increased risk, but adjust that to the UK population as a whole and it represents a far bigger number, and most people are not drinking just one drink a day."" A glass of red wine a day is not healthy, say researchers The lead author of the study Dr Max Griswold, at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME), University of Washington, said: ""Previous studies have found a protective effect of alcohol on some conditions, but we found that the combined health risks associated with alcohol increases with any amount of alcohol. ""The strong association between alcohol consumption and the risk of cancer, injuries, and infectious diseases offset the protective effects for heart disease in our study. ""Although the health risks associated with alcohol start off being small with one drink a day, they then rise rapidly as people drink more."" Booze calculator: What's your drinking nationality? Alcohol limits cut to reduce risks Does moderate drinking prevent dementia? Six charts on how the British drink In 2016, the government cut the levels of alcohol it recommends for men and women to no more than 14 units a week - equivalent to six pints of average strength beer or seven glasses of wine. At the time, England's chief medical officer, Prof Dame Sally Davies, noted that any amount of alcohol could increase the risk of cancer. Prof Saxena said the study was the most important study ever conducted on the subject. She explained: ""This study goes further than others by considering a number of factors including alcohol sales, self-reported data on the amount of alcohol drunk, abstinence, tourism data and the levels of illicit trade and home brewing."" The study shows that British women drink an average of three drinks a day, and rank eighth in the world of highest drinkers. British men by contrast, ranked 62nd out of the 195 countries surveyed, even though they also drink on average three alcoholic drinks a day. This is because the drinking levels were far higher generally among men, with Romanian men drinking more than eight drinks daily. A drink was defined as 10g of alcohol, which equates to a small glass of wine, a can or bottle of beer, or a shot of spirits.  In the UK one unit is 8g of alcohol. Around the world, one in three people are thought to drink alcohol and it is linked to nearly a tenth of all deaths in those aged 15 to 49. Prof Saxena said: ""Most of us in the UK drink well in excess of safe limits, and as this study shows there is no safe limit. The recommendations need to come down further and the government needs to rethink its policy. If you are going to drink, educate yourself about the risks, and take an informed risk."" Large glass of wine - 3 units Pint of higher-strength lager or beer - 3 units Standard glass of wine - 2 units Pint of lower-strength lager or beer - 2 units Bottle of lager or beer - 1.7 units Single shot of spirits - 1 unit Source:NHS Choices,external Yet Prof David Spiegelhalter, Winton Professor for the Public Understanding of Risk at the University of Cambridge, sounded a note of caution about the findings. ""Given the pleasure presumably associated with moderate drinking, claiming there is no 'safe' level does not seem an argument for abstention,"" he said. ""There is no safe level of driving, but the government does not recommend that people avoid driving. ""Come to think of it, there is no safe level of living, but nobody would recommend abstention.""

"This video can not be played Jacob Rees-Mogg told BBC Newsnight that the Treasury was in a ""Brexit panic"" Brexiteers have attacked Philip Hammond for reiterating a warning that a ""no-deal"" Brexit could damage the economy. The chancellor's warning was publishedin a letter,external, hours after the government laid out plans for a""no-deal"" Brexit. Conservative MP Marcus Fysh accused Mr Hammond of embarking on ""another instalment of dodgy project fear"". Meanwhile, the World Trade Organization head has told the BBC no deal ""would not be the end of the world... but it's not going to be a walk in the park"". In a letter published on the Treasury website, Mr Hammond repeated the findings of the Treasury's provisional Brexit analysis released earlier this year. What do the Brexit 'no deal' papers reveal? Reality Check: What would 'no deal' look like? That analysis includes a warning that a ""no-deal"" Brexit could mean a 7.7% hit to GDP over the next 15 years, compared with the ""status quo baseline"". Writing to Nicky Morgan, chairwoman of the treasury committee, he said that under a ""no-deal"" scenario chemicals, food and drink, clothing, manufacturing, cars and retail would be the sectors ""most affected negatively in the long run"". He added that the largest negative impacts would be felt ""in the north-east [of England] and Northern Ireland"". The letter also said Treasury analysis estimated borrowing would be around Â£80bn a year higher under a ""no-deal"" scenario by 2033. Mr Hammond added that this analysis was now ""undergoing a process of refinement"" and emphasised that a ""no-deal"" Brexit was not the government's preferred option and that it was ""confident of a agreeing a good deal"". How a no-deal Brexit could affect Britain, according to the government's advice The timing of the letter was criticised, coming so soon after Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab sought to play down the risk of no deal - describing the impact as a ""potential short-term disruption"". Prominent Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg, who has written to all Tory local associations urging them to reject the PM's Chequers deal, said leaving on WTO terms was not ""as absurdly frightening as the chancellor of the exchequer thinks it may be"". ""As a dog returneth to his vomit, so a fool returneth to his folly,"" he said. ""The naysayers in the Treasury have consistently wanted to paint a bleak picture because they are frightened of taking responsibility for managing the economy without the crutch of the EU. It is a sign of their weakness. ""What Mr Hammond is doing is a reminder of why no-one believes the politicised forecasts of the Treasury. The Treasury is desperate to stop Brexit. Everything the Treasury does has to be read in this light."" But Tory MP Sarah Wollaston, who backs a new referendum on the outcome of the Brexit negotiations, said Mr Hammond's comments were timely and they complemented, rather than contradicted, the no-deal analysis. She told BBC Radio 4's Today that Mr Rees-Mogg, who chairs the European Research Group (ERG) of Tory MPs, held too much sway in the party and the ""ERG tail is wagging the Conservative dog"". Cabinet Office minister David Lidington said there was ""nothing new"" in the chancellor's comments, telling Today that it was ""clear"" that leaving the EU without an agreement was ""not a desirable outcome"". Asked whether he agreed with his colleague Liam Fox, who claimed earlier this month the odds were 60:40 in favour of a ""no-deal"" exit, Mr Lidington said he was not a betting man but the odds of a deal were ""good"". ""We have to do the emergency 'no-deal' planning but it is not in our interests we end up in that position."" Shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said: ""A 'no-deal' Brexit has never been viable and would represent a complete failure of the government's negotiating strategy."" Please upgrade your browser Roberto Azevedo, the director-general of the WTO, said there would be an impact from a ""no-deal"" Brexit, with the possibility of trade ""barriers"" at the borders and tariffs between the UK and the EU almost certain. ""The EU cannot discriminate amongst the WTO members, so the UK will have to be treated as all the other members, and the other members pay tariffs so the UK will have to pay tariffs as well,"" he said. He was also asked whether the UK could unilaterally remove its trade tariffs. ""Technically, yes,"" he replied. ""But not only to the EU, to everybody, so you cannot pick and choose to whom you lower your tariffs. ""If you decide that a particular product, let's say glasses, that they go down to zero, that's perfectly right, any member of the WTO can do that. But that zero applies to everyone else.""

" Britain's two new aircraft carriers are leviathans and an extraordinary feat of British engineering. Standing on board, it's hard not to be impressed by the sheer scale. Inside the labyrinth of passageways - wider and more spacious than those on the older US Nimitz-class carriers  -  you'll find a chapel, a hospital and five galleys to feed the 700-plus crew. That figure rises to 1,600 when you add the flight crews, engineers and Royal Marines who might also be on board. Even fully crewed there's still plenty of room. The generously sized sleeping cabins are a far cry from the cramped conditions of most warships. There are five gyms to burn off the calories, though crew members can clock up 20,000 steps - as far as eight miles (13km) - during their average working day. The 65,000-tonne HMS Queen Elizabeth is longer than the Houses of Parliament and, from keel to the top of the highest mast, taller than London’s Nelson’s Column. You could fit three football pitches on her massive flight deck. She has been built to carry up to 36 new F-35 stealth jets, as well as helicopters. But in reality she'll routinely sail with fewer than half that number. The first jets will fly off her deck in flight trials taking place off the east coast of the US this autumn. And she'll sail on her first “operational deployment” in 2021. HMS Queen Elizabeth is like a small town. Her engines could provide enough power to run tens of thousands of homes. The ship, and her sister carrier, HMS Prince of Wales, may have been inspired by US Navy equivalents, but the design is uniquely British. 2013: The forward island of the Queen Elizabeth is transported out of Portsmouth Harbour The bulky angular appearance is, in part, down to how she's been assembled. Sections have been built in shipyards across the UK - Glasgow, Hebburn, on the Tyne, Appledore, in North Devon, Portsmouth and Birkenhead - and then ferried to Rosyth, in Scotland, to be welded together. Sharing the work was  a political, as well as a practical, decision. Rosyth, with its large dry dock, was chosen as the main assembly site when construction work began in 2009. It was just up the coast fromthe then Prime Minister Gordon Brown’s constituency. Unlike most other aircraft carriers, the Queen Elizabeth class has two “islands"", or towers, protruding from the flight deck. The forward island houses the bridge for the ship's navigation. The aft island is the flight-control - or Flyco - tower. Large floor-to-ceiling windows on both the bridge and in the Flyco give the crew an unparalleled view of the flight deck. The Royal Navy argues that having two separate islands will allow the carrier to continue operating should one be damaged or destroyed. But there's another reason. The towers cover the ships' two exhausts and funnels. While US and French carriers are nuclear powered, the Queen Elizabeth and Prince of Wales run on two large gas-turbine and four diesel engines. They'll have to be refuelled regularly. Four new tankers have been ordered to do the job - all built in South Korea, not UK shipyards. 1918: A Sopwith Camel fighter plane landing on the HMS Argus, an early British aircraft carrier For almost a century the massive bulk and distinctive profile of a carrier on the horizon has marked the ultimate representation of military might. It is “gunboat diplomacy” on steroids. It's been said that the first question a US president asks in a crisis is: “Where's the nearest carrier?” In 1918, after several years of British and American experimentation with carriers, the UK commissioned HMS Argus, originally designed as an ocean liner but adapted while under construction, to be the world's first full-length flat-deck carrier. The same year the UK started work on its first purpose-built carrier, HMS Hermes. HMS Hermes, the world's first purpose-built aircraft carrier After World War Two the British experimented with steam-powered catapults - an innovation that was to become the standard way to launch aircraft at sea. In many ways the Royal Navy led the rest of the world. As Britain's global influence shrank, so did its navy and the size of its aircraft carriers. By the 1990s the Royal Navy had three small “light” carriers - HMS Invincible, HMS Illustrious and HMS Ark Royal. These were primarily designed to carry helicopters to hunt down Russian submarines during the Cold War. But along with the Harrier jump jet, they kept the Royal Navy in the carrier business. Retaining the capability had proved vital during the Falklands War in 1982. Britain sent two carriers - HMS Invincible and the older HMS Hermes -  to the South Atlantic. HMS Hermes (successor ship) in the south Atlantic during the Falklands War, 1982 They provided air cover for the vulnerable task force while 8,000 miles from home. Without the carriers and their Harrier jets, few believe it would have been possible to recapture the islands. An aircraft carrier is a floating piece of sovereign territory which, in theory, has the ability to manoeuvre over 70% of the world's surface. Commodore Andy Betton, the UK carrier strike group commander, says it can deliver “a meaningful and credible fighting force” anywhere in the world without having to worry about asking for another country's permission. The last of the light carriers and their Harrier jump jets were scrapped as part of the substantial cuts of the 2010 defence and security review. It was a decision largely based onthe state of the budget. HMS Ark Royal, an Invincible-class carrier, was decommissioned in 2011 By the time HMS Queen Elizabeth goes on her first deployment, Britain will have been without an aircraft carrier for more than a decade. But the truth is the UK has managed without. Throughout that time Britain has still been able to launch air strikes around the world from land - in Afghanistan, against Libya in 2011, or more recently against the Islamic State group. At Akrotiri, in Cyprus, Britain already has a permanent base in the middle of the Mediterranean Sea. Britain's lack of an aircraft carrier has caused, for some, a dent in national pride rather than a debilitating gap in military operations. But it certainly has made a difference to how the UK is perceived by allies. In 2014, the former US Defence Secretary, Robert Gates, warned that without aircraft carriers Britain would not have the “full spectrum” of military capabilities and therefore risked its position as a full military partner of the US. Perceptions matter. An aircraft carrier is a statement of intent and global ambition as well as a very visible projection of military power. That's why the US Navy has 10. China has one and is building another. Russia and France each have a carrier and have now been joined by India. China's first domestically manufactured aircraft carrier during its first sea trial The UK's investment in these new carriers was a political, as much as a military, decision. Nick Childs, a naval analyst at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, says that when Tony Blair's government decided to press ahead with the carrier project in 1998 “it was a deliberate decision to step up the strategic ladder”. The Royal Navy is already referring to the new ships as Britain's “conventional deterrent” - a complement to the nuclear deterrent of Trident missiles carried by the four Vanguard-class submarines. In the words of the captain of the first of these carriers, HMS Queen Elizabeth, “it's going to be an iconic symbol of British naval power”. Her captain, Commodore Jerry Kyd, boldly predicts the carriers will put the Royal Navy and the UK “back in the premier league” of the world's maritime powers. The new carriers are built on a scale that defiesthe realities of a shrinking Royal Navyand smaller defence budget. The two ships have cost more than £6bn to build. That's almost double the original budget, although the Navy is keen to highlight that they've been built to last for the next 50 years. Given the parlous state of the UK's finances in 2010, David Cameron's coalition government briefly thought about scrapping the whole programme. But ministers found out that cancelling the contract would have cost them more in penalty fees than pressing ahead. Then there was talk of selling off, or “mothballing”, one of the carriers. In the end, it was decided both would be entering service - stretching the Royal Navy's already limited resources. An F-35B Lightning II flies during a training mission in Florida, 2013 But there are already doubts over whether Britain can afford that number. Earlier this year the Commons Public Accounts Committee warned the entire carrier strike programme left the defence budget “financially exposed”. Among the concerns highlighted by MPs were fluctuations in the value of the pound, post-Brexit, making the F-35 even more expensive. The National Audit Office estimates the costs of building the two new carriers, along with the initial order of F-35 jets and the Merlin Helicopters that will provide early-warning radar, will be more than £14bn. Costs will inevitably rise. The navy has still to work out how it will transport people and equipment on and off the carrier while at sea. It might mean purchasing new US tilt-rotor aircraft, like the Osprey. And operating the carriers and their jets won't be cheap, either. It costs the US Navy more than $100m (£78m) a year to keep just one of their larger Nimitz-class carriers at sea, not including the costs of flying operations, ammunition and the salaries of the crew. The UK Ministry of Defence hasn't been able to provide figures for the running costs of the new vessels. But Greg Bagwell, a former RAF air marshal, believes it'll be a strain on already limited resources. He says Britain “does not have the money, people or capacity” to run the carriers as the navy would like. Carriers don't sail around the world alone. They are sent as a “strike group”. First Sea Lord Admiral Sir Philip Jones says that in “high threat” areas Britain's carriers would be protected by two air-defence destroyers, two anti-submarine warfare frigates and an attack submarine - along with a  tanker and a “solid support” ship carrying food and ammunition. That would be a sizeable chunk of the Royal Navy’s shrinking fleet. The navy has struggled with crewing and maintenance of its hunter-killer submarines. Last year there was a short period when all seven were tied up. HMS Ambush, one of the Royal Navy's attack submarines Navies around the world use “the rule of thirds”. For every ship at sea, one is getting ready for a deployment, while another is back in port, undergoing maintenance. That leaves little spare capacity. We should in the future expect to see more auxiliary ships, minehunters and patrol vessels doing the tasks of frigates - whether helping hurricane-hit British overseas territories or escorting Russian warships through the English Channel. Dr Peter Roberts, director of military sciences at the Royal United Services Institute, says the navy simply will not have the ability to protect its carriers “from all threats from all-comers on its own”. He believes Britain will be “wholly reliant on European, US or Australian allies”. That view has been echoed by the government's national security adviser, Sir Mark Sedwill, who earlier this year signalled to MPs that the carriers would be part of a larger international task group in times of danger. In reality the Royal Navy is already a shadow of what it used to be. Critics around the world have painted a picture of a navy that once “ruled the waves” being in perpetual decline. 1946: The battleship King George V returns to Portsmouth after war action in the Pacific By the time of the Falklands War in 1982, the Royal Navy had half that number - 60 warships. Further defence cuts, after the 2010 strategic defence and security review, took it to its current level - a new low of 19 frigates and destroyers. The navy argues that today's warships are far more sophisticated than those of the past. One new one is worth many old ones, so the argument goes. But then again, today's British warships are hardly armed to the teeth. Most have empty spaces on board for weapons the navy can't currently afford - like cruise missiles or the most up-to-date anti-ship missiles and anti-submarine torpedoes. The navy has struggled to crew one carrier, let alone two. Such is the personnel shortage that a frigate and destroyer have been tied up in Portsmouth as “harbour training ships” for the past 18 months. But the Royal Navy has, to some extent, prepared itself for the challenge. While a US carrier has more than 3,000 sailors on board, HMS Queen Elizabeth's crew is made up of just 700 - or 1,600 with all of the flight crew and marines. The navy argues it has been able to keep numbers low by relying on automation. Moving bombs and missiles to the flight deck, for instance, is done by a series of machines and lifts. But Cdre Kyd has already hinted he might not have enough people on board HMS Queen Elizabeth. He has described the basic crew of 700 as a “good starting point”. On a recent visit to the ship I was told the crew numbers had already gone up to nearer 800. The Royal Navy is staking its future on two very expensive warships that will put a considerable strain on already limited resources. The military historian, Sir Max Hastings, has called them “symbols of everything that's wrong with British defence policy”. He provocatively predicted they'll be two “giant embarrassments” consuming “immense resources while possessing almost zero utility”. Before he resigned as defence secretary last year, Sir Michael Fallon, dismissed the criticism. He said “armchair” commentators  should “shut up” and described the carrier as “a highly versatile and potent force” that would be capable of humanitarian and disaster relief as well as “high-end warfighting”. Gavin Williamson, his successor, said the carrier showed the rest of the world that the UK was “not a nation in retreat” and that it would “strike fear into the hearts of all our enemies” and allow Britain to “project its influence and its power right across the world”. The carriers have to some extent become a totem for the ambitions of a  post-Brexit “global Britain”. 2017: The US aircraft carrier USS George HW Bush anchored off the British coast They will certainly be a welcome addition for the UK's closest military ally - the United States. The US has been a big influence on Britain re-entering the small group of nations operating “supercarriers”. The US Navy has also helped its UK counterpart to retain the skills it needs to operate aircraft carriers. UK pilots have been allowed to fly off US carriers and there's been help in training UK flight-deck crews. The US aircraft carrier Carl Vinson But Britain's decision to invest in its biggest warships in an era of austerity might look to some like delusions of grandeur. Nick Childs acknowledges there might be a perception, as a result of Britain’s history, of “a self-consciousness about trying to revive past imperial glories, or having continuing pretensions of being a pocket superpower”. The Royal Navy will now be able to plug the gaps for the Americans when they can't send one of their own carriers to the Gulf. There are even new facilities being built in the middle east to support them. 2015: Philip Hammond (then foreign secretary) and the Bahraini foreign minister “break the ground” on the UK's naval support facility in Bahrain The US Marine Corps’ F-35 jets will be on HMS Queen Elizabeth's first operational deployment. They'll certainly help fill the massive deck early on when the UK will have a relatively small number of F-35s of its own. Cdre Betton says that “allies will help share the burden of resources” and “expand the authority of working as part of a coalition”. In other words, give it more international clout. But it's the UK that will have to pick up the bills for operating these enormous ships. Greg Bagwell says there's a danger the ships will “distort and skew” Britain's armed forces. The Queen Elizabeth-class carriers are nearly three times the size of the old Invincible-class. They're also bigger than France's carrier, Charles de Gaulle, and only slightly smaller than the US Nimitz-class. Some argue the navy could - and should - have managed with smaller vessels - on the scale of the Invincible light carriers. The Italian Navy's new Trieste-class carrier, currently being built, is a third of the size and, in theory, a third of the cost of HMS Queen Elizabeth. Dr Roberts says: “We've built something huge to do the same thing that we were doing 20 years ago much more cheaply.” Cdre Betton insists “size gives you versatility” and “political and strategic choice”. He argues the old Invincible-class carriers would not have been able to provide enough jets at a “sustained” level. The carrier can also be loaded with a mix of different helicopters - including Merlins (general-purpose and anti-submarine capability), Wildcats (multi-role), Chinooks (heavy-lift and transport) and Apache ground-attack helicopters. The reality is that because the nation has invested so much in these carriers they'll have to be jacks of all trades. Just to run the carriers the navy is having to get rid of other ships. It has already sold the ageing HMS Ocean, its helicopter landing ship. Ocean was used to launch Apache helicopters during the Libya campaign in 2011 and most recently to help last year in hurricane relief in the Caribbean. The navy needed Ocean's crew for the second carrier. It is also having to work out whether it can afford to operate and crew its two amphibious assault ships, HMS Albion and HMS Bulwark. The biggest break with convention is the way Queen Elizabeth will launch and recover aircraft. Most aircraft carriers operate catapults to launch their jets and arresting wires to recover them - what's called “cats and traps”. The Queen Elizabeth class does not. The new F-35B jets will take off from a “ski jump” at the front of the ship and then hover to land - similar to the way Harrier jump jets flew on and off HMS Ark Royal. In theory the Queen Elizabeth-class carriers could be fitted with “cats and traps”. This was considered in 2012 but was deemed too expensive - the estimated cost of fitting them to just one carrier went up from £500m to £2bn. Some in the Navy still hope they'll be retrofitted at a later date to operate other aircraft - such as unmanned drones. Without “cats and traps” there will be limits to the other nations that can use the British carriers. The US-designed F-35 will be Britain's first “stealth” fighter - designed to strike deep into enemy territory while being harder to detect by enemy radar. Three variants of this fighter have been developed - the A variant for land bases, the B variant for short take-offs and vertical landings (STOVL) and the C variant for aircraft carriers fitted with “cats and traps”. The production cost for each aircraft has been $120m (£95m). Software, spares and support will add to the final bill. The main contractor, Lockheed Martin, says that as production ramps up, the cost of each aircraft will drop considerably. British defence firms are involved in the project, making about 15% of the jet, but it's still expensive. Greg Bagwell suggests there's “no way” Britain can afford to keep the 24 F-35s on board the carrier for routine deployments. He adds that, in contrast to the Royal Navy, the US Navy will be flying their older F-18 jets alongside their F-35s. The older cheaper jets will be the workhorses. In contrast, Mr Bagwell says, “we'll be using a thoroughbred for donkey rides”. But Cdre Betton, who's overseeing the Royal Navy's carrier strike group, says 24 is the “minimum credible number to support an operation”. It signals a potential fight between the RAF and the Royal Navy over numbers and who has operational control of the aircraft - especially in the early days when numbers of the aircraft available are low. The F-35's “stealth” capability and sophisticated sensors will give the navy an edge gathering large amounts of data and intelligence in dangerous places. But it won't be easy for the F-35 to relay all the information securely - not least to a ship with limited bandwidth. The navy says this challenge will eventually be overcome. Russia has already called HMS Queen Elizabetha “large convenient target”. Many nations are investing heavily in anti-ship missiles. China can produce hundreds of its DF-21D ballistic ship missiles for the cost of a single carrier. The Pentagon estimates the range of such a missile is more than 1,000 miles. Russia and Iran are also acquiring anti-ship missiles as well as submarines - another obvious threat to the carrier. But you don't need sophisticated weaponry to target a large ship. Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps has practised swarming a US carrier as it passes through the narrow Strait of Hormuz. Dozens of small speed boats could potentially be used to overwhelm a carrier's defences. And no-one can discount the possibility of terrorist groups getting hold of low-tech anti-ship missiles, boats or drones loaded with explosives to target a carrier near the shore. However, Adm Jones believes that the great advantage of a carrier strike group is that it's always a “moving target”. The captain of HMS Queen Elizabeth, Cdre Kyd, also insists that finding a carrier in a large ocean isn't that easy, especially when the enemy has to penetrate “layers of defence” from the other ships, aircraft and submarines that'll protect it. It's also worth remembering they'll be in service for half a century - the final captain of HMS Queen Elizabeth probably has not yet been born. But Dr Roberts says there's a danger that the nation has built a narrative that says these two carriers represent “the essence of Britain”. That makes them very tempting targets for any adversary. There is the danger, too, that with the Royal Navy's resources and efforts focused so much on the carriers, it becomes little more than a “carrier escort fleet”. Given the huge pressures on the defence budget, some will ask whether these are ships the nation can really afford. Cdre Betton insists there is no “buyer's remorse”. There are still good reasons why Britain has invested so much money and its national prestige in building these two massive warships. The UK is a maritime nation. The carriers will be able to project British military power right across the globe for the next half-century. They will be used to deepen defence relationships with key allies - most notably the US. But the sheer cost of running these two behemoths at a time when the defence budget is already under huge strain may make it difficult for the Royal Navy to keep its ambitions afloat.

"Prisoners should stop being released on Fridays because it can prove hard for them to access benefits, medication and assistance, campaigners have said. A third of all prisoners in England and Wales are currently freed on a Friday but social justice charity Nacro says it is ""often a race against the clock"". Some agencies close early, leaving newly-freed prisoners sleeping rough and at risk of re-offending, it says. The Ministry of Justice confirmed it was examining Friday releases. I'll quit if jails don't improve - minister Private probation contracts to end early More than 25,000 prisoners were released on a Friday last year. Nacro says while support may be put in place during the 12 weeks prior to release, ""the day itself is often crucial for putting in place the basic building blocks for life outside of prison"". ""We know that there is often a window of opportunity for people on release when they are keen to make change and move on,"" it said. ""However, this can be quickly lost when the barriers are too high and things are not in place to help them move forward and away from crime."" The charity said prisoners sometimes find they are without vital medication and have to survive on a Â£46 discharge grant until support services reopen on Monday. Nacro chief executive Jacob Tas said ending Friday releases would be a ""simple and cost-effective step"" to take as the government consults on reforms to probation services andtakes action to deal with violence and drugsin prisons.

"Luton Airport was rated one star in half of the 10 categories assessed, including toilets and baggage drop queues Luton Airport has been named the worst in the UK for the third year in a row in a passenger satisfaction survey. Luton was rated one star for its baggage drop queues, shops, seating, toilets and staff in the Which? study. An airport spokesman said the survey represented a fraction of passengers and that 70% of people it polled were ""happy with their experience"". Doncaster Sheffield was named the best UK airport, with praise for its queues, facilities and speedy baggage reclaim. It came top of the consumer group's list for the second year, and got an overall score of 87%. Doncaster Sheffield Airport got an 87% customer satisfaction rating, with five stars for customer service The report blamed ""disastrous customer service"" for Luton Airport's customer score of 35%, based on overall satisfaction. But Nick Barton, CEO of the airport, said Â£160m had recently been spent on improvements. ""In the first six months of 2018, 1.2 million passengers responded to our customer service tracking, 70% of whom told us they were happy with their experience,"" he said. Luton Airport: what do passengers say? 1. Doncaster Sheffield (87%) 2. Southend (84%) 3. Newcastle (74%) 4. Southampton (73%) 5. Exeter (72%) 1. Luton (35%) 2. Stansted (44%) 2. Manchester Terminal 3 (44%) 4. Manchester Terminal 1 (46%) 5. Aberdeen (49%) Which? surveyed its subscribers who had travelled through an airport between May 2017 and May 2018. Customer score is based on a combination of overall satisfaction and how likely respondents were to recommend the airport to a friend. The title of second-worst UK airport, according to Which?, is jointly held by Stansted and Manchester Terminal Three, both recording scores of 44%. A spokesman for the Manchester Airports Group (MAG), which operates Stansted and Manchester, said both airports had grown their passenger numbers by nearly 50% over the last five years. He added: ""MAG is now investing in our airports to create brand new facilities, more capacity and better designed space. ""We are also investing in more front line staff and a number of other initiatives to provide passengers with a good experience at our airports."" Luton Airport (pictured in 2011) is the fifth largest in the UK in terms of passengers but is one of the smallest in size at 196 hectares (484 acres) Luton is in the large UK airports category with 10m or more passengers per year, and Doncaster is classed as a small airport. Luton is now the UK's fifth-busiest airport in terms of people using it, carrying 16 million passengers in 2017, compared to Doncaster's 1.3 million. Doncaster Sheffield Airport chairman Robert Hough said he was ""proud"" of the ""great recognition"", adding: ""We have always set out to deliver a top class passenger experience, it's what people should enjoy when at an airport."" Luton is undergoing a multi-million pound terminal expansion, which has led to disruption, and recentlycelebrated its 80th birthday.

"Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab said he hoped the no-deal preparations would be ""rendered redundant"" by an agreement with the EU Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab has set out what he called ""practical and proportionate"" advice in case the UK leaves the EU without a deal. The guidance includes instructions for businesses who could face extra paperwork at borders and contingency plans to avoid medicine shortages. Britons visiting the EU could also face extra credit card charges. Ministers say a deal is the most likely outcome but that ""short-term disruption"" is possible without one. BBC political correspondent Chris Mason described the publication as a ""vast swirling porridge of detail - much of it at a technical level, advising individual industries about the manner in which they are regulated in the event of a no-deal Brexit"".

Please upgrade your browser Analysis by BBC deputy political editor John Pienaar This didn't seem a comfortable moment for Dominic Raab. The Brexit secretary campaigned for Leave, and is a true believer in the cause. Yet here he was, setting out plans to cope with a British failure to reach the kind of deal Brexiteers once claimed would be easy to accomplish. Again and again, the Brexit department's guidance refers to the ""unlikely event"" of Brexit without an EU deal - but Dominic Raab conceded it could happen. The risk was real. The International Trade Secretary, Liam Fox, has suggested that outcome is more likely than not. The Brexit secretary may disagree on the level of risk, but could not deny that it would lead to higher costs and a fresh burden of red tape on businesses, scientific and medical research and individuals. Read John's blog on the no-deal papers The European Commission said Brexit would lead to disruption ""with a deal or without a deal"". ""That's why everybody, and in particular economic operators, need to be prepared,"" it said. Thecommission has already published,externalits own assessment of no deal, saying there would be ""no specific arrangement"" for EU citizens living in the UK or for UK citizens in the EU and warning of ""significant delays"" at borders. For Labour, shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer said Mr Raab's speech was ""thin on detail, thin on substance and provided no answers to how ministers intend to mitigate the serious consequences of leaving the EU without an agreement"". ""A no-deal Brexit has never been viable and would represent a complete failure of the government's negotiating strategy,"" he said. Welsh First Minister Carwyn Jones said a no-deal Brexit would cause ""huge disruption and serious, long-lasting economic and social damage"", and Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable added: ""This isn't project fear by critics of Brexit, this is the government itself and independent bodies pointing to the damage that will be caused.""

"Brexit Secretary Dominic Raabhas set out what he called ""practical and proportionate"" advice in case the UK leaves the EU with ""no deal"". Ministers say a deal is the most likely outcome but the government has published25 documents of guidance for people and businesses across a variety of areas,externalto try to avoid the ""short-term disruption"" which it admits is possible if the two sides cannot reach a deal. Reality Check: What would 'no-deal' look like? Fox: No-deal most likely Brexit outcome Scottish government warns against 'no-deal' Brexit Brexit: The key dates ahead BBC correspondents have unpicked some of the key details of the newly-published papers. The details on ""no deal"" published by the government are sobering. Just take one - trade across the border between the UK and the EU post-Brexit if there is no agreement. If there is no deal and Britain reverts to ""third country"" status, the government has provided a long list of preparations that firms which export and import to and from the EU will be required to undertake. Customs declarations would be needed, tariffs (import and export taxes) ""may also become due"" and the government also says firms are likely to need to invest in new computer systems to track goods. ""If the UK left the EU on 29 March 2019 without a deal, there would be immediate changes to the procedures that apply to businesses trading with the EU. It would mean that the free circulation of goods between the UK and EU would cease,"" the government says. That is the crux of the problem. Leaving the single market and the customs union without a deal means significantly higher barriers to trade with the EU. And higher costs for firms that are engaged in that trade. Some of the overall costs to the economy might be mitigated over the medium term by increased trading opportunities with nations outside the EU. And the government has signalled that in some areas - such as the need for upfront payments of VAT on imports - it is doing its best to smooth the impact on cash flow by allowing for delayed payment systems. That has been welcomed by business groups. But what is key from the documents published on Thursday is pretty straightforward. The costs of ""no deal"" are likely to be substantial. And consumers and businesses would be the ones paying the bill. Read more from Kamal Not so long ago, anyone going online to buy a flight, clothes, or even just a new spade could have been hit with a surcharge simply for the luxury of paying by credit card, debit card, or using a digital service such as PayPal. The government described them as ""rip-off fees"" and in January they were made illegal as the UK adopted EU rules. In a ""no-deal"" scenario the government says those surcharges could return for anyone in the UK buying something from a retailer in the EU - something that happens regularly through online shopping. Equally, any transaction across the border could become slower as UK financial services could no longer plug into the EU's payments system. Those UK expats living and drawing a pension in Europe may also be affected. As the Association of British Insurers (ABI) has warned, there is a risk that, without an agreement, a UK insurance company paying - say - an annuity to a UK expat in the EU would no longer be authorised to do so. That pension provider would either have to risk a fine by carrying on making these payments, would have to set up a subsidiary in the EU to do so, or could do a deal with a European counterpart. The ABI argues that a relatively simple co-operation between UK and EU regulators could solve this issue, and allow people to continue drawing pensions and receiving insurance payouts. The UK government said it would give temporary permission for financial firms in the European Economic Area to pay people in the UK. Roaming charges: What will happen after Brexit? The concern in some parts of the NHS and the pharmaceutical industry is what might happen in a ""no-deal"" scenario if supply lines for medicines are disrupted. If lorries get stuck at Calais and Dover because of customs delays, vital drugs like insulin needed in the NHS might be held up. The UK currently imports more than 37 million packets of medicines each month Health and Social Care Secretary Matt Hancock has now written to NHS and social care organisations saying there is no need for hospitals, GPs and pharmacies to stockpile medicines or for doctors to write longer-dated prescriptions. He says pharmaceutical companies should have six weeks' supplies built up to avoid any possible disruption. To that end he has written to the companies asking them to clarify their plans for having these supplies. NHS and industry leaders have welcomed the extra clarity provided by ministers with Thursday's documents. They are pleased the government will allow drugs and devices tested elsewhere in the EU to be used in the UK. But they say stockpiling six weeks' worth of medicines will not be straightforward with only 200 days to go until Britain leaves the EU. Brexit: NHS managers warn about impact of no deal Brexit: What would 'no-deal' mean for food and medicine? The big Brexit question for farmers is not answered in Thursday's documents: will there be frictionless trade for the Â£45bn in agricultural produce we exchange with the EU? The National Farmers Union (NFU) has talked of an ""Armageddon"" in agriculture if there's no deal. ""This is what's keeping us awake at night,"" one NFU official told me. But one of the papers does give a taste of potential challenges to come. It covers organic food and highlights the need for a new process of certification. When Britain leaves the EU, British organic food will have to be certified by UK bodies which will themselves have to be recognised by the EU. That's a task that can take up to nine months, the document warns, and it may not be possible to start it until Britain actually becomes a ""third country"". But without going through these hoops, Britain's organic farmers will not be able to export across the Channel. The NFU describes this as a ""cliff-edge"" scenario. The Soil Association says delays could significantly hinder trade. There's another concern as well: the EU currently runs a system for tracing organic produce and the UK will need to set up its own version. Many wonder if that will be ready by next April. Post-Brexit farming funding set out by Michael Gove One line in the technical note on research is ringing alarm bells. It spells out that when Britain is not a member of the EU, it will no longer be eligible for grants from the prestigious European Research Council (ERC). While non-EU countries can take part in the much larger Horizon 2020 programme - and the government says it hopes that Britain will - the ERC, which is worth 17% of the total, will be closed to them. This could matter hugely to dozens of researchers up and down the country. A lab at the Francis Crick Institute is exploring new vaccines against cancer and has just started to receive a five-year ERC grant of â¬2.5m. Would a ""no-deal"" Brexit mean that that flow of funding would stop at the end of March? The possible implications of a ""no-deal"" scenario for the Culham Centre for Fusion Energy are not clear Another set of concerns is uncertainty over nuclear research as Britain leaves the Euratom treaty which covers radioactive materials. Whether it's nuclear fuel or radioactive isotopes for medical use, arrangements will pass into UK hands. Operators ""may"" need to apply for licences for trade with the EU, the government says. And the fate of Europe's fusion research centre at Culham in Oxfordshire is addressed but left unclear. Brexit barriers 'would harm science', say universities Does it matter if the UK leaves Euratom? The EU has been publishing its own preparedness advice for months now, for all Brexit outcomes. On Thursday, EU officials pointed out, as they have done many times before, that ""the withdrawal of the UK is going to lead to disruption, regardless. So with a deal or without a deal. That's why everybody, and in particular economic operators, need to be prepared"". The impacts highlighted by the UK's notices for a ""no-deal"" scenario are, the EU side says, the ""automatic, mechanical"" effect of the UK quitting the EU and moving outside the single market and the customs union and all their associated rules and regulations. In the event of a no deal, the impact will be felt on Brexit day in March next year. EU sources say their efforts right now are going into negotiating a withdrawal treaty, as that is the way to mitigate a ""no-deal"" scenario. The EU's own notices say it will be bound, legally, to treat the UK as a ""third country"" after Brexit, and that will limit any ability to waive EU rules and regulations especially for the country. Which puts the focus back on the issues still holding up the withdrawal treaty, such as the so-called ""Irish backstop"", if a ""no deal"" is to be avoided.
