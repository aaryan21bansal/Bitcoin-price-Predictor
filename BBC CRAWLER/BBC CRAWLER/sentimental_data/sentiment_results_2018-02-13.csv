"Juan Alberto Fuentes was Guatemala's finance minister before he became chairman of Oxfam International The chairman of the charity Oxfam International, Juan Alberto Fuentes, has been arrested in Guatemala. He was detained as part of an investigation into a corruption scandal dating back to his time as Guatemala's finance minister. No charges have been brought so far. While his arrest is not related to his role at Oxfam,it will heap further pressure on the charity, which is still reeling from revelations that its staff hired prostitutes in Haiti. Oxfam International's executive director Winnie Byanyima said that Mr Fuentes had been ""entirely open with his Oxfam board"". ""He has assured us that he has co-operated fully with the investigation in the confidence he did not knowingly transgress rules or procedures,"" Ms Byanyima said. It comes as Oxfam faces scrutiny over a scandal in Haiti in 2011, where senior aid workers - including the country director Roland Van Hauwermeiren - allegedly paid for sex. Some of the claims say the women may have been underage. The scandal has forced the resignation of the organisation's deputy chief executive, Penny Lawrence, andshaken public confidence in both Oxfam and other charities.

Deputy resigns over how sex claims were handled Oxfam boss says charity is ashamed Actress quits Oxfam over Haiti sex claims In Guatemala, Mr Fuentes is among 10 top former government officials arrested on Tuesday, including former President Ãlvaro Colom. Ãlvaro Colom was president from 2008 until 2012 The ex-officials are being investigated in connection with a public bus system, which was developed during Mr Colom's government between 2008 and 2012. No details have been given of the charges those arrested may face. The investigation is being led by the International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG). The commission is a United Nations body created in 2006 designed to strengthen the country's rule of law. Apart from Mr Colom, those arrested are the former ministers of finance, interior, education, defence, employment, economy, health, culture and the environment. How Guatemalans began daring to say what they think Attorney General Thelma Aldana said that her office was investigating the purchase by Ãlvaro Colom's government of more than 3,000 buses in 2009. Ms Aldana says that only 455 of the buses ever arrived in Guatemala. Mr Colom is the second former president to be investigated over corruption by CICIG in the past months. His successor in office,Otto PÃ©rez Molina, who governed from 2012 to 2015, is due to stand trial for his alleged role in a huge corruption schemeinvolving Guatemala's customs service. CICIG also said current President Jimmy Morales should be investigated because of alleged funding irregularities in his 2015 election campaign. In response, President Morales said the CICIG's head had been interfering in Guatemala's domestic affairs and ordered his deportation, butthe order was overturned by the country's highest court.

"Actress Minnie Driver has stood down from her role as a celebrity ambassador for Oxfam. This follows claims that staff for the charity in Haiti and other countries paid vulnerable people for sex. In a statement Ms Driver said she was ""nothing short of horrified"" by the allegations. Oxfam said it was ""grateful"" for Ms Driver's commitment and that it was ""more committed now than ever to learn from our mistakes"". The British charity is accused of concealing the findings of an inquiry into claims staff used prostitutes while delivering aid in Haiti in 2011. Organisations including Marks and Spencer and the Duke of Edinburgh's (DofE) Award have also said they are considering their association with the charity. Ms Driver, best known for the films Good Will Hunting, Grosse Point Blank and Hope Springs, said although she could not continue her 20 years of involvement with Oxfam, she would work against ""social and economic injustice"". Reality check: How much money goes to Oxfam? How will the Haiti scandal affect Oxfam? Oxfam boss says charity is ashamed Oxfam did not disclose 'full Haiti details' She added: ""I certainly will not let the abhorrent mistakes of a troubling organisation stop me or anyone else from working with good people in this space to support a population of human beings around the world that needs our help."" The actress later said on Twitter that she was ""devastated by the response"" of Oxfam which she had been ""raising awareness for since I was nine years old"". Ms Driver had been to countries including Cambodia and Thailand in her role as a celebrity ambassador, and also performed at a fundraising concert for Oxfam. Allow Twitter content?

The Charity Commission has launched a statutory inquiry into Oxfam - which denies a cover-up - but details of its scope have not yet been released. Oxfam officials are due to meet the Charity Commission on Wednesday. The commission is also looking into claims that Roland van Hauwermeiren - the charity worker at the centre of the sexual misconduct scandal in Haiti - was employed by Oxfam, two years after he left another aid agency because of concerns about his behaviour. A former colleague,externalhas told the IRIN website that van Hauwermeiren was investigated by British health charity Merlin after it was alleged that he used prostitutes in Liberia in 2004. Merlin later merged with Save The Children, which says it does not have access to Merlin's records. ""We have immediately contacted Save The Children to establish whether they have any knowledge of and/or hold any records about these reports either at the time of the merger or subsequently and if so to ask them to urgently disclose this information to us,"" a Charity Commission spokesperson said. The commission said its own records did not go back to 2004. Oxfam said that with 10,000 NGOs working in Haiti alone in 2011, ""it was unfortunately not possible for Oxfam to ensure that those found guilty of sexual misconduct were not re-employed in the sector"". This video can not be played Sexual misconduct ""happens at every agency"",  says an ex-UN aid worker More than 1,200 Oxfam donors cancelled their direct debits on Saturday, Sunday and Monday.On average there are 600 cancellations per month. But Oxfam said there had been an increase in one-off donations on Tuesday. The organisation received 78 single gifts, the highest of any day this year, and 44 new regular gifts (direct debits), the highest since March 2017. International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt said she would ""not hesitate"" to cut government funding to charities that failed to put robust safeguarding measures in place. At an event in Stockholm to find ways to end violence against children, she said: ""No organisation is too big, or our work with them too complex, for me to hesitate to remove funding from them if we cannot trust them to put the beneficiaries of aid first."" Ms Mordaunt, who is also due to speak to the National Crime Agency about the issue, said Oxfam's failure to deal with the actions of some of its staff should be a ""wake-up call"" to the sector. ""It was not just the processes and procedures of that organisation that were lacking but moral leadership,"" she added. Ms Driver is the first of Oxfam's celebrity supporters to publicly address the scandal. But some companies have spoken about their relationship with the charity. The DofE Award said in light of the allegations, it would ""be reviewing our association with Oxfam as a participant volunteering provider"". Teenagers can volunteer in Oxfam charity shops through the award. The programme said it had not received notification of any safeguarding incidents involving DofE participants volunteering in Oxfam stores. M&S, which has worked with Oxfam since 2008, said in a statement: ""M&S continues to monitor the situation very closely as we seek to understand the steps that Oxfam is taking to address them and develop a robust safeguarding plan for the future."" Since the allegations came to light, Oxfam's deputy chief executive,Penny Lawrence, has resignedover the charity's handling of the misconduct. In a separate blow for the charity,Oxfam's international chairman, Juan Alberto Fuentes, was arrested in Guatemalaas part of a corruption investigation relating to his time as the country's finance minister.

"A man reportedly jumped from a building in Swan Street A woman has been found dead in a flat in Manchester after reports of a man jumping from a second storey window. The man reportedly jumped from a building in Swan Street, Ancoats, before ""a number of people"" were assaulted at about 07:40 GMT, police said. Police later entered a flat and found the body of a woman. A 37-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder and remains in custody for questioning. Several roads remain closed including Swan Street, and police are advising people to avoid the area. Forensic officers are working at the scene The man landed on the roof of a car after jumping from the building, cracking the front and rear windscreens. Ben Sheridan, who was in the vehicle with his mother and father,told the Manchester Evening News,external: ""He jumped out of the window, on to our car. ""And then he's run off, attacked a few people and smashed some other cars up. ""We were just getting ready to leave and he's hit my mum a couple of times. I'm starting to calm down but I'm still quite panicked."" From the scene: Ian Haslam, BBC News There's a heavy police presence here on Swan Street in Ancoats. Officers were called to reports that a man had jumped from an upper floor and landed on a car below that, at the time, had people in it. There are then reports that a man assaulted a number of people in the street. Following the arrest of a 37-year-old man, officers discovered the body of a woman in a flat, transforming this into a murder inquiry. Greater Manchester Police said the investigation was at an early stage and appealed for witnesses to contact them.

"Senior West Midlands Police officer Marcus Beale was suspended from the force A senior counter terrorism officer with West Midlands Police is facing dismissal for leaving top secret papers in the boot of his car. The highly classified documents were stolen from Assistant Chief Constable Marcus Beale's unmarked car in May. A special disciplinary panel found him guilty of gross misconduct and has recommended he is dismissed. The 54-year-old, who is due to retire in April, stands to lose a Â£215,000 pension lump sum if sacked. In December, Mr Bealepleaded guilty to breachingterms of the Official Secrets Act and was fined Â£3,500. The senior officer, who has a 30-year police career, has been suspended on full pay since November. Midlands Live: Lighter fuel sprayed in man's face; plans for 2022 athletes' village revealed The panel heard several classified documents - including top secret minutes of a meeting of the Executive Liaison Group (which passes on intelligence of major covert terror investigations to police forces) - were placed in a metal briefcase in the boot of Mr Beale's car on 10 May. The briefcase also contained details of organised crime and highly sensitive information about a high-profile investigation. None of the papers was supposed to be taken off police premises, the panel heard. Mr Beale's car was parked in several different locations over five days, including at a railway station while he had a weekend away in London with his wife, a pub and a supermarket. He only realised the briefcase was gone on 15 May. The panel chair noted that the whereabouts of the documents remains a ""mystery"". Defending Mr Beale, John Beggs QC argued it was an ""isolated act, wholly out of character"". He summarised 98 testimonials in support of Mr Beale, who ""has helped stop people being murdered and maimed"" and referred to cases where terror plots were foiled as being partly down to his leadership. Fiona Barton QC, representing West Midlands Police, said: ""The impact could have been catastrophic. It is a matter of luck the documents do not appear to have seen the light of day. ""The documents should never have been in a locked briefcase and in an unattended car certainly not for a few minutes, let alone days."" Delivering the panel's verdict, its chairman, Corinna Ferguson, said: ""We have decided to recommend dismissal as the appropriate outcome. ""We consider this as the necessary sanction for what we regard as a serious breach of protocol as to the handling of top-secret and secret material, as it is necessary to retain public confidence and the reputation of the police."" Mr Beale's future now rests with the chief constable of West Midlands Police, Dave Thompson. A decision is expected to be made in the next few weeks.

"This video can not be played Hundreds of people are involved in the search operation Speed sensors that were iced over may have caused a passenger jet to crash near Moscow, killing all 71 people on board, investigators say. The faulty instruments could have given the pilots wrong speed data, Russia's Interstate Aviation Committee said. The Saratov Airlines jet went down minutes after take-off from Moscow's Domodedovo airport on Sunday. More than 1,400 body parts and hundreds of plane fragments have been recovered from the crash site. A preliminary analysis of the on-board flight recorder indicated the plane had problems two-and-a-half minutes after it took off, at an altitude of around 1,300m (4,265ft). The instruments began displaying different speed readings, probably because of iced speed sensors while their heating systems were shut off, the committee said. When the crew detected the issue, they switched off the plane's autopilot. They eventually took the plane into a dive at 30-35 degrees. Who were the victims? Russian media reports said the plane's captain had rejected a de-icing treatment on the plane before take-off. The procedure is optional and the crew's decision is based mainly on the weather conditions. Iced-over speed sensors, known as Pitots, were cited as the likely reason for a 2009 Air France plane crash, which killed 228 people. More than 700 people are involved in the search operation, struggling through deep snow. The emergencies ministry is collecting DNA samples from victims' relatives as part of the identification process of the 65 passengers, including a child and two teenagers, and six crew. Faulty instruments may have caused the crash, investigators say Wreckage and body parts are strewn over a large area - about 30 hectares (74 acres) - near the village of Argunovo, about 80km (50 miles) south-east of Moscow. The Antonov An-148 was en route to Orsk in the Ural mountains and lost contact at 14:27 (11:27 GMT), without sending any emergency call. Russia's Investigative Committee said the plane was intact when it crashed and that an explosion happened on impact. Flight-tracking site Flightradar24 said it descended at the rate of 1,000m (3,300ft) per minute. Air disasters timeline The jet, which was reportedly seven years old, was being flown by an experienced pilot who had 5,000 hours of flying time. A criminal inquiry has been launched. In 2015 the regional airline was banned from operating international flights, after inspectors found someone other than the flight crew in a cockpit. The airline appealed and changed its policy before resuming international charter flights in 2016. Antonov aircraft were first developed in Ukraine, but are also made in Russia. The twin-engine model involved in Sunday's crash had its first flight in 2004. In 2011, one broke up mid-flight during a training flight in the Belgorod region in southern Russia, killing all six crew members on board.

"Gaia Pope's body was found 11 days after she went missing on 7 November A teenager whose disappearance sparked a major search died of hypothermia, an inquest has heard. Gaia Pope, 19, from Langton Matravers, Dorset, was reported missing on 7 November. Her body was found 11 days later near the Dorset coast path. An inquest into her death heard there were no suspicious circumstances or signs of third party involvement. A family statement said there were questions which ""must still be answered"". The inquest in Bournemouth heard Miss Pope had severe epilepsy and was living in Swanage when she went missing. Her body was discovered in undergrowth on the cliff top between Dancing Ledge and Anvil Point to the west of Swanage. Scores of people attended a vigil at Swanage amphitheatre after Gaia Pope's death An initial post-mortem examination was unable to determine a cause of death but further tests showed she died from hypothermia. The coroner requested a series of reports from Dorset Police, the neurologist treating her epilepsy and from the Dorset Heathcare University NHS Trust, which had been providing care to Miss Pope. The coroner also requested an entomology report to see if more information can be gathered about the time of her death. Miss Pope's disappearance prompted a massive campaign from family and friends who spent days scouring the town and surrounding area along with police and coastguard teams. Following the inquest hearing, her cousin Marienna Pope-Weidemann issued a statement on behalf of the family praising the ""incredible grassroots efforts"" of the local community during the search. ""Every minute without Gaia feels like an hour and every hour without answers seems endless. ""We know now what took her from us but when, how and why are all questions that must still be answered, not just for our sake but for the sake of the next family who wakes up in that nightmare someday.

"Mr Netanyahu is reported to have met investigators several times Israeli police say that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu should be charged over alleged bribery cases. A police statement said there was enough evidence to indict Mr Netanyahu for bribery, fraud and breach of trust in two separate cases. Speaking on Israeli television, Mr Netanyahu said the allegations were baseless and that he would continue as prime minister. The allegations, he said, ""will end with nothing"". One case centres on an allegation that Mr Netanyahu asked the publisher of an Israeli newspaper, Yediot Aharonot, for positive coverage in exchange for help in reining in a rival publication. Police said the editor of Yediot Aharonot, Arnon Mozes, should also face charges. Is this game over for Netanyahu? Netanyahu: The commando turned PM The second allegation centres on a claim that Mr Netanyahu, Israeli prime minister since 2009, received gifts worth at least a million shekels ($283,000; Â£204,000) from Hollywood mogul Arnon Milchan and other supporters. The Jerusalem Post says the gifts included champagne and cigars, and were given in exchange for help getting Mr Milchan a US visa. Mr Milchan, the producer of films including Fight Club, Gone Girl and The Revenant, should face bribery charges, police said. Arnon Milchan (centre) with Leonardo DiCaprio and Steven Spielberg The police statement said that Mr Netanyahu, after receiving gifts, pushed for the Milchan Law, which would have ensured that Israelis who return to live in Israel from abroad were exempt from paying taxes for 10 years. The proposal was eventually blocked by the finance ministry. Police say Mr Netanyahu is also suspected of fraud and breach of trust in a case involving Australian billionaire James Packer. Israel's Channel 10 reported in December that Mr Packer told investigators he gave the prime minister and his wife Sara gifts. Israeli media say Mr Netanyahu has been questioned by investigators at least seven times. A final decision on whether Mr Netanyahu should face charges will come down to the attorney general's office. A decision could take months to reach. Justice Minister Ayelet Shaked said any prime minister who has been charged should not be obliged to resign. Speaking on Israeli television, Mr Netanyahu said he would continue in his role. The next legislative elections are scheduled for November 2019. Mr Netanyahu heads a fragile coalition, but on television, he appeared confident the allegations would not spur new elections. ""Over the years, I have been the subject of at least 15 enquiries and investigations,"" he said in his TV address. ""Some have ended with thunderous police recommendations like those of tonight. All of those attempts resulted in nothing, and this time again they will come to nothing."" The 68-year-old is in his second stint as prime minister, and has served in the role for a total of 12 years. He has faced a number of allegations in his time in office. After his first term as prime minister two decades ago, police recommended that he and Sara face criminal charges for keeping official gifts that should have been handed over to the state. The charges were later dropped. In July 2015, the couple were accused of charging the government for the services of a contractor who did private work for them. The charges were later dropped.

Becky Dobson, 27, Stuart Hill, 30, and his brother Jason Hill, 32, were on the ""holiday of a lifetime"" when they were killed. Three other Britons and the pilot were injured, but were not rescued until eight hours later on Sunday morning. Safety officials have said the crash investigation will take 18 months. In a statement released via the Foreign Office, Rev David and Sandra Hill said their sons, from West Sussex, were ""inseparable brothers"" and ""remarkable people"" who will be ""deeply missed by so many people"". Britons killed in Grand Canyon crash named Friends pay tribute to victims The pair were on holiday with friends celebrating Stuart's 30th birthday. ""We always said they were so close they were like twins and we will find some support in knowing they were with each other to the last,"" the statement added. ""We will thank God every day for having them in our lives."" Becky Dobson and her boyfriend Stuart Hill died in the crash They said they were praying for those injured and that their ""hearts go out to Becky's family"". Ms Dobson's father, Peter Dobson, told the Press Association his daughter was ""full of life"" and ""always happy"". Britons Ellie Milward, 29, Jonathan Udall, 32, and Jennifer Barham, 39, were injured in the crash, along with pilot Scott Booth, 42, police said. Jonathan Udall and his wife Ellie Milward, both on left, were injured in the crash and Becky Dobson and Stuart Hill were both killed Crash investigators said they were in contact with the survivors and hoped to secure statements from them during the coming days. It is not clear what caused the crash on Saturday evening. Witnesses say rescue efforts were hampered by high winds. This video can not be played Tributes paid to helicopter crash victims ""Once the wreckage has been recovered, we will start to gather archive information relating to the pilot, the aircraft and the environment,"" national transportation safety board investigator Stephen Stein told a press conference in Nevada on Monday. He said a preliminary report is expected in five to 10 days, but the final report would take 18 months to deliver ""because it's a very technical-heavy investigation"". The helicopter came down, during a tour of the canyon, on Saturday evening Investigators have to take helicopters into the valley and then hike down to the base of the canyon to access the crash site, Mr Stein told reporters. The aircraft will soon be moved to a site in Phoenix for further examination. Mr Stein said the ""crash-resistant fuel system"" is a very important part of this investigation. He said there was ""evidence of post-crash fire"" and images have shown the aircraft engulfed in flames. A temporary flight restriction in the area remains in place.

"Jacob Zuma has been president of South Africa since 2009 South Africa's governing African National Congress (ANC) has formally asked President Jacob Zuma to resign for the sake of the country. But despite the ANC's top leadership deciding to ""recall"" him ""urgently"", the scandal-hit Mr Zuma was still in power on Tuesday. He is expected to respond to the request on Wednesday, an official said. He had already told them he was willing to stand down in the next three to six months, the official added. Mr Zuma, who has been in power since 2009, has been dogged by corruption allegations. Six reasons why Zuma is under pressure The many trials of Jacob Zuma But he has so far resisted increasing pressure to quit since December, when his deputy, Cyril Ramaphosa, replaced him as leader of the ANC. Wednesday's cabinet meeting, usually chaired by Mr Zuma, has been postponed because of ""developments taking place in the ruling party"",a government statement said,external. Ace Magashule, the ANC's secretary-general, told reporters the party's National Executive Committee (NEC) decided the removal should be ""treated with urgency"". ""The NEC has noted South Africa is going through a period of uncertainty and anxiety as a result of unresolved matter of transition,"" he said. Mr Magashule said the country needed to build on the ""renewed hope"" felt after the election of Mr Ramaphosa as ANC leader. ""It is obvious we want Comrade Ramaphosa to come in as the president of South Africa,"" he added. This video can not be played ANC seeks 'amicable' Zuma resolution He said the president was expected to respond to the NEC's decision on Wednesday, although they had given him no deadline. ""When we recall our deployee, we expect our deployee to do as asked,"" Mr Magashule said. ANC NEC member Lindiwe Zulu told the BBC the party will give Mr Zuma an opportunity to respond to its request. ""There is no guillotine here. He is a comrade,"" she said. South Africa's opposition parties have already expressed reservations about the ANC's confidence that Mr Zuma will step down. ""The only way to remove Jacob Zuma as president of our country is for parliament to do so through a motion of no confidence,""the Democratic Alliance (DA) tweeted,external. It called the motion brought by another opposition party, the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), to be brought forward from 22 February so parliament can ""remove Jacob Zuma"". By Lebo Diskeo, BBC News, Johannesburg Although it was hardly an unexpected announcement, there was still a sense of disbelief among the waiting journalists as Mr Magashule announced the NEC has asked Mr Zuma to step down. After such a long wait, we had half expected the ANC to say they had given him more time, or reached some sort of compromise. But surprise gave way to bemusement as Mr Magashule side-stepped repeated requests for clarification on what the ANC will do if President Zuma refuses to resign by Wednesday. As for whether the ANC would support an opposition motion of no confidence, Mr Magashule said he did not know. But when asked what Mr Zuma said when he was told of the NEC's decision, Mr Magashule choice of words were pointed: the president had said he was ""a disciplined member of the ANC"". It was a term repeated several times during the briefing. In other words, as far as the ANC is concerned - it is done. Mr Zuma's presidency has been overshadowed by allegations of corruption which he has always vehemently denied. In 2016, South Africa's highest court ruled that Mr Zuma had violated the constitution when he failed to repay government money spent on his private home. Last year the Supreme Court of Appeal ruled that he must face 18 counts of corruption, fraud, racketeering and money-laundering relating to a 1999 arms deal. This video can not be played The Zuma presidency: Scandals and successes More recently, Mr Zuma's links to the wealthy India-born Gupta family, who are alleged to have influenced the government, have caused his popularity to plummet. Both Mr Zuma and the Guptas deny the allegations. The formal request to resign is difficult to resist, but he is not legally obliged to do so and could technically carry on as president despite losing the support of his party. However, should he continue to defy his party, he would be expected to face a confidence vote in parliament. Mr Zuma has survived other such votes but he is not expected to pull it off again. A confidence vote would be considered a humiliating process for him and the party. In terms of the constitution, it will require the entire cabinet to resign and for the parliamentary speaker to serve as acting president until MPs elect a new president. Many in the ANC hope that removing Mr Zuma will boost the party's chances in the 2019 elections The ANC was badly rattled by its performance at the 2016 local elections whenit won its lowest share of the vote since coming to power under the late Nelson Mandela in 1994. It wants to project a fresh image for next year's general election. Having served two terms in office (South African presidents are elected by parliament), Mr Zuma cannot legally return to power in any case. On Monday, opposition parties called for an early election. ""Anyone from the ANC that wants to lead this country, must get their mandate from the people of South Africa,"" DA leader Mmusi Maimane told reporters.

"An arrest warrant for the Wikileaks founder Julian Assange has been upheld by Westminster Magistrates' Court. The warrant was issued in 2012 when Mr Assange, 46, breached bail conditions by seeking political refuge at the Ecuadorean embassy. On Tuesday, the judge said he needed to face justice for breaching bail and therefore the warrant should remain. Mr Assange, who has been staying at the embassy since 2012,tweeted his ""surprise"",externalat the decision. His bail was set in relation to sexual assault allegations he faced in Sweden. The allegations were dropped in May 2017. Under the warrant, Mr Assange would be arrested as soon as he left Ecuadorean soil. As there is not an extradition treaty between the UK and Ecuador, he cannot be arrested inside the embassy. To explain his decision to break his bail conditions, Mr Assange argued that should he face the Swedish authorities, they would extradite him to the US. He fears he would be charged by US authorities for publishing classified documents on his Wikileaks website. Assange granted Ecuadorean citizenship Assange arrest a 'priority', US says Profile: Julian Assange But Judge Emma Arbuthnot said she did not find this fear ""reasonable"" - as any decision by Sweden to extradite Mr Assange to the US would cause a diplomatic crisis. Even if that decision was taken, she argued, Mr Assange would be able to argue against extradition by citing extraneous circumstances, fair trial concerns and poor conditions in US detention centres. In her ruling,,externalshe described Mr Assange as ""a man who wants to impose his own terms on the course of justice, whether the course of justice is in this jurisdiction or Sweden"". ""He appears to consider himself above the normal rules of law and wants justice only if it goes in his favour."" Mr Assange's lawyers said his arrest for failing to answer bail was no longer in the public interest but the judge rejected that argument. ""Defendants on bail up and down the country, and requested persons facing extradition, come to court to face the consequences of their own choices,"" she said. ""He should have the courage to do the same."" After the ruling, Mr Assange posted his reaction on Twitter, saying: ""We are surprised. ""Judge went well outside what the parties presented in court. This seems to have led to many factual errors in the judgment."" A small group of supporters stood quietly outside the court, holding banners reading ""Free Assange"" and ""Assange Safe Passage"". Mr Assange's lawyer, Mark Summers, said his client was living in conditions ""akin to imprisonment,"" adding that his ""psychological health"" had deteriorated and he was ""in serious peril"". The court heard that Mr Assange suffers from a bad tooth, a frozen shoulder and depression. The judge rejected these claims as reason to lift the warrant, saying: ""Mr Assange's health problems could be much worse."" She also rejected a UN report,cited by Mr Assange in his appeal, that said he is subject to arbitrary detention. She highlighted that he himself had negotiated the bail conditions he went on to break.

"Stuart (left) and Jason Hill were among three Britons killed in the crash The parents of two British tourists who died in the Grand Canyon helicopter crash have paid tribute to their ""wonderful sons"". Becky Dobson, 27, Stuart Hill, 30, and his brother Jason Hill, 32, were on the ""holiday of a lifetime"" when they were killed. Three other Britons and the pilot were injured, but were not rescued until eight hours later on Sunday morning. Safety officials have said the crash investigation will take 18 months. In a statement released via the Foreign Office, Rev David and Sandra Hill said their sons, from West Sussex, were ""inseparable brothers"" and ""remarkable people"" who will be ""deeply missed by so many people"". Britons killed in Grand Canyon crash named Friends pay tribute to victims The pair were on holiday with friends celebrating Stuart's 30th birthday. ""We always said they were so close they were like twins and we will find some support in knowing they were with each other to the last,"" the statement added. ""We will thank God every day for having them in our lives."" Becky Dobson and her boyfriend Stuart Hill died in the crash They said they were praying for those injured and that their ""hearts go out to Becky's family"". Ms Dobson's father, Peter Dobson, told the Press Association his daughter was ""full of life"" and ""always happy"". Britons Ellie Milward, 29, Jonathan Udall, 32, and Jennifer Barham, 39, were injured in the crash, along with pilot Scott Booth, 42, police said. Jonathan Udall and his wife Ellie Milward, both on left, were injured in the crash and Becky Dobson and Stuart Hill were both killed Crash investigators said they were in contact with the survivors and hoped to secure statements from them during the coming days. It is not clear what caused the crash on Saturday evening. Witnesses say rescue efforts were hampered by high winds. This video can not be played Tributes paid to helicopter crash victims ""Once the wreckage has been recovered, we will start to gather archive information relating to the pilot, the aircraft and the environment,"" national transportation safety board investigator Stephen Stein told a press conference in Nevada on Monday. He said a preliminary report is expected in five to 10 days, but the final report would take 18 months to deliver ""because it's a very technical-heavy investigation"". The helicopter came down, during a tour of the canyon, on Saturday evening Investigators have to take helicopters into the valley and then hike down to the base of the canyon to access the crash site, Mr Stein told reporters. The aircraft will soon be moved to a site in Phoenix for further examination. Mr Stein said the ""crash-resistant fuel system"" is a very important part of this investigation. He said there was ""evidence of post-crash fire"" and images have shown the aircraft engulfed in flames. A temporary flight restriction in the area remains in place.

"The Premier League has seen a decline in the money raised from the sale of rights to broadcast matches in the UK. In total BT and Sky bid Â£4.4bn to screen the lion's share of 200 games for each season between 2019-2022. That amount falls short of the Â£5.1bn the Premier League netted in 2015. Two packages to show 20 midweek matches are still to be sold, but experts say it is unlikely they will raise enough to top the previous rights deal. ""I don't think that those two packages by themselves are going to bridge the gap between what the domestic rights were sold for last time and what they're going for this time,"" said Dan Jones, head of the sports business group at the accountancy firm Deloitte. In 2012, BT and Sky paid Â£3bn for the rights to show matches between 2013 and 2015, up from Â£1.77bn in the previous three-year cycle. In 2015, the Premier League then took a total of Â£5.1bn for the next three years. Despite the fall in the overall take for the Premier League, BT Sport will pay more to broadcast each match under its new agreement. Sky, on the other hand, will pay less. Kieran Maguire, a senior teacher in accountancy at the University of Liverpool, said that Sky and BT need to think carefully about what they charge viewers for the football packages. ""If you get the pricing right the subscribers will be there, but there's not a lot of wiggle room there to go up in terms of what they are charging per month, and that's why subscribers have been turning away,"" he says. In December,Sky and BT signed a deal to sell their channels on each other's platforms. Under the deal, BT agreed to supply its sports channels, which show Uefa Champions League and Europa League fixtures, to Sky. BT was also able to sell Sky's Now TV service, which includes Sky Sports, to its customers. Sky's broadcasting rights include its flagship Sunday afternoon slots and Saturday night games. BT will show Saturday lunchtime games. 200 games per season for three years in seven packages Sky Sports has won four packages to screen 128 matches per season It will pay a total of Â£3.5bn or Â£9.3m per game BT Sport has one package to screen 32 matches per season It will pay a total Â£885m or Â£9.2m per game Two packages of 20 games each are still up for auction BT Sport paid Â£960m to screen 42 games per season, or Â£7.6m a match Sky Sports paid Â£4.1bn to show 126 matches per season or Â£11m per game BT said it has been ""financially disciplined"" during the bidding process, and that it expects to make returns through subscription, wholesale, commercial and advertising revenues. It added that its customer base had more than doubled when it acquired EE. Despite the fall in total take for the Premier League, Mr Jones said the deal ""will still leave the Premier League as the richest league in the world by a margin"". He added: ""The Premier League still has its overseas rights to sell and the uplift in those will more than cover any shortfall in the domestic rights I expect."" In the 2015 auction, the Premier League sold the international rights to live football games for about Â£3.3bn over three years, on top of the Â£5.1bn it raised from selling the UK rights. George Salmon, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: ""There's two packages still up for grabs, but so far Sky is the big winner from the Premier League auction. ""Securing more games at a lower cost is a major coup, and with BT seemingly content to play second fiddle on the Premier League, that rivalry now looks to have thawed.""

"This video can not be played Ben Stokes appeared at Bristol Magistrates' Court England cricketer Ben Stokes is to go on trial after being accused of fighting outside a Bristol nightclub in September. The 26-year-old Durham all-rounder is charged with affray after a man allegedly suffered a broken eye socket. Mr Stokes, who missedthe Ashesafter being suspended from England duties, is accused jointly with two others. Ryan Hale, 26, and 28-year-old Ryan Aslam Ali, both from Bristol, will face trial on the same charge. Mr Stokes was granted unconditional bail after appearing at Bristol Magistrates' Court and isnow set to travel to New Zealand to re-join the England squadas part of their Twenty20 tri-series. The three defendants were detained early on 25 September following a disturbance in the Clifton Triangle area of the city - several hours after England had played a one-day international against the West Indies. District Judge Simon Cooper, who also granted Mr Hale and Mr Ali unconditional bail, sent the case to trial at Bristol Crown Court. The first hearing, which Mr Stokes is not expected to attend, is due on 12 March. Mr Stokes' court appearance had clashed withEngland's defeat earlier to New Zealand, in which he had been due to make his international comeback. Ben Stokes arriving at court in Bristol on Tuesday morning In a statement posted on Twitter last month the player, from the Castle Eden area of Durham, said he was ""keen to have an opportunity to clear my name"". As a result of the charge, Mr Stokes missed the Ashes series, which hosts Australia won 4-0, although he was allowed to play some domestic matches in New Zealand. The charge of affray is made under the Public Order Act 1986 and effectively relates to fighting in public. It is a triable either-way offence, which means it can be heard in either the magistrates' court or the crown court. It carries a maximum penalty when tried summarily - in the magistrates' court - of a fine or up to six months in prison, and when tried on indictment - in the crown court - of up to three years in prison. He has also beengiven permissionby the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) to take part in the Indian Premier League, which starts in April. Last month, the ECB said that, ""given the potential length of time to trial"", it would not be ""fair, reasonable or proportionate for Ben Stokes to remain unavailable for a further indeterminate period"".

"Senior West Midlands Police officer Marcus Beale was suspended from the force A senior counter terrorism officer with West Midlands Police is facing dismissal for leaving top secret papers in the boot of his car. The highly classified documents were stolen from Assistant Chief Constable Marcus Beale's unmarked car in May. A special disciplinary panel found him guilty of gross misconduct and has recommended he is dismissed. The 54-year-old, who is due to retire in April, stands to lose a Â£215,000 pension lump sum if sacked. In December, Mr Bealepleaded guilty to breachingterms of the Official Secrets Act and was fined Â£3,500. The senior officer, who has a 30-year police career, has been suspended on full pay since November. Midlands Live: Lighter fuel sprayed in man's face; plans for 2022 athletes' village revealed The panel heard several classified documents - including top secret minutes of a meeting of the Executive Liaison Group (which passes on intelligence of major covert terror investigations to police forces) - were placed in a metal briefcase in the boot of Mr Beale's car on 10 May. The briefcase also contained details of organised crime and highly sensitive information about a high-profile investigation. None of the papers was supposed to be taken off police premises, the panel heard. Mr Beale's car was parked in several different locations over five days, including at a railway station while he had a weekend away in London with his wife, a pub and a supermarket. He only realised the briefcase was gone on 15 May. The panel chair noted that the whereabouts of the documents remains a ""mystery"". Defending Mr Beale, John Beggs QC argued it was an ""isolated act, wholly out of character"". He summarised 98 testimonials in support of Mr Beale, who ""has helped stop people being murdered and maimed"" and referred to cases where terror plots were foiled as being partly down to his leadership. Fiona Barton QC, representing West Midlands Police, said: ""The impact could have been catastrophic. It is a matter of luck the documents do not appear to have seen the light of day. ""The documents should never have been in a locked briefcase and in an unattended car certainly not for a few minutes, let alone days."" Delivering the panel's verdict, its chairman, Corinna Ferguson, said: ""We have decided to recommend dismissal as the appropriate outcome. ""We consider this as the necessary sanction for what we regard as a serious breach of protocol as to the handling of top-secret and secret material, as it is necessary to retain public confidence and the reputation of the police."" Mr Beale's future now rests with the chief constable of West Midlands Police, Dave Thompson. A decision is expected to be made in the next few weeks.

"The Commonwealth has secretly begun considering who might succeed the Queen as its head, the BBC has learned. The issue is hugely sensitive because the role is not hereditary and will not pass automatically to the Prince of Wales on the Queen's death. The Commonwealth has set up a ""high level group"" to look at the way the international organisation is governed. This group is meeting later, officially to review how the Commonwealth is run by its secretariat and governors. It said the issue of the succession of the head of the Commonwealth was not part of the group's mandate, but described the day-long discussions as ""open"". However, senior sources added that the gathering in London would also consider what happens when the Queen, who turns 92 in April, dies. What is the Commonwealth of Nations? How relevant is the Commonwealth today? Royal Family present list for 2017 revealed One said: ""I imagine the question of the succession, however distasteful it may naturally be, will come up."" The agenda for the summit, seen by the BBC, says there will be a discussion of ""wider governance considerations"" which insiders say is code for the succession. The group is expected to report to the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) in London in April, which is likely to be the last that the 91-year-old monarch will attend. The group said it was independent of the London-based Commonwealth Secretariat, and would report only to the heads of Commonwealth governments. The Queen congratulating winners of the Commonwealth Youth Awards in 2016 A second source said the issue of the succession is expected to be discussed by Commonwealth leaders on the margins of the summit, particularly when they meet without officials ""on retreat"" at Windsor Castle. The Queen was proclaimed Head of the Commonwealth at her coronation in 1953, when she was head of state in seven of its eight members.

How relevant is the Commonwealth today? Royal Family present list for 2017 revealed One said: ""I imagine the question of the succession, however distasteful it may naturally be, will come up."" The agenda for the summit, seen by the BBC, says there will be a discussion of ""wider governance considerations"" which insiders say is code for the succession. The group is expected to report to the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) in London in April, which is likely to be the last that the 91-year-old monarch will attend. The group said it was independent of the London-based Commonwealth Secretariat, and would report only to the heads of Commonwealth governments. The Queen congratulating winners of the Commonwealth Youth Awards in 2016 A second source said the issue of the succession is expected to be discussed by Commonwealth leaders on the margins of the summit, particularly when they meet without officials ""on retreat"" at Windsor Castle. The Queen was proclaimed Head of the Commonwealth at her coronation in 1953, when she was head of state in seven of its eight members. Although the Queen took over from her father George VI, it is not an hereditary position that will pass automatically to her son - who will be head of state in only 15 of the 53 member nations that now make up the Commonwealth. It is a loose association of former British colonies, plus some other nations It was founded in 1931 There are 53 member countries Its secretariat (headquarters) is based in London About 2.4bn people live in Commonwealth countries Any decision about the future would have to be made by the Commonwealth heads of government at the time of the Queen's death. But there is no formal process for choosing her successor. While many Commonwealth figures presume there will be no realistic alternative to Prince Charles, there has in the past been talk of electing a ceremonial leader to improve the organisation's democratic credentials. Prince Charles is considered the obvious successor to the Queen as head of the Commonwealth One source said the issue to be decided was whether a one-off decision should be taken to appoint Prince Charles to the position, or whether a new process should be agreed to ensure that it is always the British monarch who automatically becomes head of the Commonwealth. ""There are various formulas being played with,"" the source said. ""Should it always be the heir to the throne or Prince Charles himself? Is it the person or the position?"" The high level group, which is made up of seven senior former ministers from the Commonwealth, will meet at the body's London headquarters at Marlborough House. The group, which has its own staff and budget, is independent of the Commonwealth Secretariat. It will look at how the secretariat is run and funded, how a new secretary general is chosen and the balance of power between the Commonwealth's governors and executive committee. According to documents seen by the BBC, the high level group will not just confine itself to bureaucratic changes. The agenda for the meeting says: ""Discussions will take into consideration the issues raised in the first session and also the wider governance considerations of the Commonwealth."" The Queen has been the head of the Commonwealth since her coronation in 1953. In that time she has travelled across the constituent countries, including Australia in 1977, above The Queen has been working in private to try to ensure that Prince Charles does succeed her, sending senior officials around the world to lobby Commonwealth leaders. At the last CHOGM in Malta in 2015, the Queen told them that she could not ""wish to have been better supported and represented in the Commonwealth than by the Prince of Wales who continues to give so much to it with great distinction"". The Prince of Wales represented the Queen at the CHOGM in Sri Lanka in 2013. A whole section of his website is devoted to the Commonwealth, noting that he has visited 41 out of 53 countries and has been a ""proud supporter"" for more than four decades. The high level group consists of: Chairman Anote Tong: Former president of Kiribati Lord Howell: Former British energy secretary Louise Frechette: Former United Nations deputy secretary general Robert Hill: Former Australian defence minister Dame Billie Miller: Former deputy prime minister of Barbados Dr Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala: Former Nigerian minister of finance George Vella: Former deputy prime minister of Malta Queen to cut plastic use on royal estates Queen visits local WI despite power cut Coronation details revealed in documentary Bird flu confirmed in Queen's swans Firefighters running out of water as wildfire declared most destructive in LA's history In maps: Thousands of acres on fire in LA 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Why does Trump want Greenland and what do its people think?

"President Jovenel Moise condemned ""sexual predator"" staff exploiting ""needy people in their moment of greatest vulnerability"" The president of Haiti has strongly condemned UK charity Oxfam, after it emerged its staff hired prostitutes while delivering aid in 2011. The charity was accused by a UK newspaper of concealing the actions. In a Twitter post, Jovenel Moise condemned the actions as an ""extremely serious violation of human dignity"". A senior government source in Haiti confirmed to the BBC that an investigation will now be launched into foreign aid agencies operating there. Haitians angered by Oxfam sex scandal One of the UK's biggest charities, Oxfam, was the subject of a report in the Times newspaper last week. The article accused the charity of concealing the findings of a 2011 inquiry into claims senior aid workers, including Haiti's national director, paid local prostitutes for sex. This video can not be played Former Oxfam employee Widza Bryant: ""I was told by many locals there were... sexual relations"" Oxfam were in the country offering relief following a devastating 7.0 magnitude earthquake that killed more than 200,000 people in 2010. How much UK money goes to Oxfam? How will the scandal affect Oxfam? The charity has since confirmed sexual misconduct occurred, and that several staff members were dismissed or resigned after the internal investigation, but denies any cover-up. It has been accused by a UK charity watchdog, which has launched an inquiry, of failing to disclose the full details. Oxfam's deputy chief executive Penny Lawrence has resigned over the handling of the scandal, and the UK government has threatened to cut funding to the charity's projects. Posting on his Twitter account (in French) Haitian President Jovenel Moise spoke out about the scandal for the first time on Monday,external. ""There is nothing more outrageous and dishonest than a sexual predator who uses his position as part of the humanitarian response to a natural disaster to exploit needy people in their moment of greatest vulnerability,"" he said. This video can not be played BBC world affairs correspondent Will Grant says locals believe aid agencies have enjoyed ""impunity"" ""What happened with Oxfam in Haiti is an extremely serious violation of human dignity,"" he said in another tweet. Several former members of Oxfam's local staff have said they tried to raise concerns but felt their complaints were ignored. Haiti country profile Did appeal money make a difference? Several Haitian NGOs have said that the problems with Oxfam in Haiti were institutional. Pierre Esperance, the head of Haiti's National Human Rights Defence Network, told the BBC: ""Oxfam, after the earthquake, became like a factory."" ""A big organisation with a lot of people with bad management. People who don't have any skill regarding development, with a lot of money, and this is the result.""

"Commonwealth members attend a heads of government meeting in Australia in 2011 Formerly known as the British Commonwealth, the Commonwealth of Nations is a loose association of former British colonies and current dependencies, along with some countries that have no historical ties to Britain. The modern Commonwealth has its roots in the Imperial Conferences of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when some of the colonies within the British Empire began to acquire greater autonomy. As some achieved self-government and varying degrees of independence from Britain, a new constitutional definition of their relationship with one another had to be found. It was only after the independence of India and Pakistan in 1947 that the Commonwealth acquired its modern shape. It dropped the word British from its name, the allegiance to the crown from its statute, and became an association for decolonised nations. The British monarch, however, remained the official head of the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth had no constitution until it adopted its Charter in 2012, which commits members to 16 core values of democracy, gender equality, sustainable development and international peace and security. Commonwealth Heads of Government Meetings (CHOGM) are held every two years to discuss issues of common interest. In between the summits, the London-based Secretariat - the Commonwealth's executive arm - takes responsibility for carrying out programmes agreed upon during the various meetings. The Secretariat is headed by a secretary-general. Head: Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II Queen Elizabeth As head of the Commonwealth, the Queen is recognised by its members as the ""symbol of their free association"". The Queen attends Commonwealth summits and the Commonwealth Games, which are held every four years. Her advanced age means that she is no longer likely to attend on a regular basis if travel involves long distances, and may delegate the duty to her heir, Prince Charles. On every Commonwealth Day, the second Monday in March, the Queen broadcasts a message to all member countries. Secretary-general: Patricia Scotland The secretary-general acts as the chief executive of the Commonwealth and is elected by heads of government from among Commonwealth diplomats and foreign ministers for a maximum of two four-year terms.  The Commonwealth has been criticised for being a post-colonial club. But to its members it is a voluntary association of independent states in the business of promoting democracy, good government, human rights and economic development. It has also been criticised for having little influence. Indeed, the Commonwealth does not act as a bloc in international affairs and has little influence over non-members. The Commonwealth Games are a major event for the association However, its influence over its own members derives from the benefits which membership brings in developmental support and cooperation on international goals. Unlike the United Nations, Commonwealth members have no contractual obligations, but members commit themselves to the statements of beliefs set out in the Charter. In 1995 the Commonwealth set up a Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group (CMAG), comprising eight ministers, whose function is to deal with governments that persistently violate Commonwealth principles. It can take such punitive collective measures as imposing economic sanctions or suspending recalcitrant members. However, the Commonwealth draws its main strength from its moral authority. Committed to racial equality and national sovereignty, it was the focus of the campaign against apartheid in the 1980s. In 1995 it suspended Nigeria's membership after the military regime there passed the death sentence on the writer Ken Saro-Wiwa and other activists, and in 2000 it suspended Fiji after the overthrow of the elected government. Zimbabwe was suspended in March 2002, after elections which observers said were marred by violence and intimidation. In December 2003 the suspension was extended indefinitely. The Zimbabwean government responded by announcing the country was leaving the Commonwealth for good. Pakistan was suspended twice during the military rule of President Pervez Musharraf. In 2013 The Gambia announced its withdrawal from what it called a ""neo-colonial institution"". Membership of the Commonwealth brings some practical benefits through the Commonwealth Fund for Technical Cooperation (CFTC). This is the main way in which the Commonwealth promotes economic and social development and the alleviation of poverty.

"Police said a black BMW had been seen driving at speed around the car park at Fir Vale School A car crashed into the front entrance of a secondary school at the height of the morning run. The black BMW was seen driving ""at speed"" around the car park of Fir Vale School in Sheffield at about 08:25 GMT before it hit the building. Two men, aged 23 and 20, have been arrested on suspicion of dangerous driving and causing criminal damage. The school, in Owler Lane, has been closed while inquiries are carried out. No-one was injured in the crash. More stories from across Yorkshire One eyewitness described hearing ""kids screaming from the main entrance"" of the school and seeing ""extensive damage"" to the building. The crash happened at about 08:25 GMT Fir Vale School, in Owler Road, has been closed following the crash Det Ch Insp Steve Ashmore, of South Yorkshire Police, said: ""The school will remain closed for the remainder of the day as officers conduct inquiries to establish the exact circumstances surrounding the incident and provide reassurance. ""We are confident that this is an isolated incident and there is no current risk to the school or the surrounding community."" A spokesperson for the school said any children who were unable to go home would be looked after on site. Gill Furniss, MP for Sheffield Brightside and Hillsborough, said she hoped to meet with police to discuss how schools can be protected against similar incidents. She said: ""I am incredibly relieved that on this occasion no-one was harmed.

"This video can not be played Ben Stokes appeared at Bristol Magistrates' Court England cricketer Ben Stokes is to go on trial after being accused of fighting outside a Bristol nightclub in September. The 26-year-old Durham all-rounder is charged with affray after a man allegedly suffered a broken eye socket. Mr Stokes, who missedthe Ashesafter being suspended from England duties, is accused jointly with two others. Ryan Hale, 26, and 28-year-old Ryan Aslam Ali, both from Bristol, will face trial on the same charge. Mr Stokes was granted unconditional bail after appearing at Bristol Magistrates' Court and isnow set to travel to New Zealand to re-join the England squadas part of their Twenty20 tri-series. The three defendants were detained early on 25 September following a disturbance in the Clifton Triangle area of the city - several hours after England had played a one-day international against the West Indies. District Judge Simon Cooper, who also granted Mr Hale and Mr Ali unconditional bail, sent the case to trial at Bristol Crown Court. The first hearing, which Mr Stokes is not expected to attend, is due on 12 March. Mr Stokes' court appearance had clashed withEngland's defeat earlier to New Zealand, in which he had been due to make his international comeback. Ben Stokes arriving at court in Bristol on Tuesday morning In a statement posted on Twitter last month the player, from the Castle Eden area of Durham, said he was ""keen to have an opportunity to clear my name"". As a result of the charge, Mr Stokes missed the Ashes series, which hosts Australia won 4-0, although he was allowed to play some domestic matches in New Zealand. The charge of affray is made under the Public Order Act 1986 and effectively relates to fighting in public. It is a triable either-way offence, which means it can be heard in either the magistrates' court or the crown court. It carries a maximum penalty when tried summarily - in the magistrates' court - of a fine or up to six months in prison, and when tried on indictment - in the crown court - of up to three years in prison. He has also beengiven permissionby the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) to take part in the Indian Premier League, which starts in April. Last month, the ECB said that, ""given the potential length of time to trial"", it would not be ""fair, reasonable or proportionate for Ben Stokes to remain unavailable for a further indeterminate period"".

"Battersea Dogs and Cats Home said there was an increased demand in London for cats Unwanted cats in Yorkshire are being sent to London where there is higher demand for pet moggies. The scheme, run by Yorkshire Cat Rescue and Battersea Dogs and Cats Home, saw more than 100 cats sent south in 2017. Yorkshire Cat Rescue said it was not sure why the county had a surplus but urged owners to neuter their pets. The charity, based in Keighley, West Yorkshire, said the scheme had been a ""brilliant partnership"" between the two organisations. More from Yorkshire Founder Sara Atkinson said: ""We send cats over the winter months, around 10-15 every two to three weeks.

Bureaucats: The felines with official positions New crayfish species has no need for males Apologies over Peter Rabbit allergy scene Why demand for cats in the south is so high is not clear but Rob Young, head of catteries at Battersea, said he believed it was partially due to the popularity of the Downing Street and Foreign Office cats, Larry and Palmerston. ""Thanks to the likes of Larry and Palmerston, more and more people are coming to our rescue centre in search of their new feline friend, and we're finding that we don't always have enough cats to meet our customers' demand. ""While it is not true for all cats, many moggies are happy to be left for periods of time and many potential pet owners are choosing cats because they fit in well with the city lifestyle.""

"One of the UK's largest industry exhibitions is issuing a new code of conduct over the use of ""promo girls"". Last year, UK Construction Week, held at Birmingham's NEC, faced criticism over the use of lightly clad women to staff an exhibitor's stall. It featured Las Vegas-style showgirls selling roofing products. Criticism of sexism at business and sports events has grown following the Financial Times' report into the President's Club ball last month. Since then, promoters of darts championships and Formula One have said they will no longer use lightly dressed young women to adorn their events. But some sectors are still using women in revealing outfits. Last week, it emerged some women working at the ICE Totally Gaming event were wearing ""little more than swimsuits"", while men wore smart suits. Others insist the practice is an intrinsic part of the way they do things. UK Construction Week attracts more than 600 exhibitors and attracts more than 35,000 people every October. The industry in recent years has run campaigns highlighting diversity in the industry and employed strategies to attract women into construction professions in order to plug skills gaps. The sight of the show girls at the October 2017 event prompted one visitor to the show to ask: ""How many hot pants do you need?"" Now the show is introducing guidelines on diversity, equality and inclusion,externaland a code of conduct for exhibitors, including on the design and staffing of stands, as well as the clothing worn. It also warns that if an exhibitor's stand theme is deemed inappropriate or doesn't comply with its equality, diversity and inclusion policy, they may not be permitted to open their stand at the event. The new guide urges exhibitors to ""Consider the mix of staff you have on the stand (gender, age, ethnicity etc). Do they represent the diversity of your company, and if not, be prepared to explain why not?"" Nathan Garnett, event director of UK Construction Week, told the BBC the Las Vegas-themed stand was a one-off: ""We had standard guidelines. We understand it was a mistake, but we've turned it in to a positive. ""The company in question has apologised for what's happened. The theme of the stand was 'Why gamble?' but it went too far."" A growing number of events and how they treat women are attracting closer scrutiny. The annual show for the international property industry, Mipim, which is held in Cannes each year, is facing accusations of being a sexist and male-dominated event. Several women I have spoken to have described the event as ""uncomfortable"" and ""laddish"", with a tradition of heavy drinking at parties on yachts and at hotels. Local sex workers allegedly used the conference's Twitter hashtag to attract customers at last year's event, but a spokesman for Mipim strongly denied accusations that prostitutes had actually attended last year's conference. He said: ""Under no circumstances does Mipim register prostitutes"" at the event. Which sports still use 'walk-on girls'?

"This video can not be played WATCH: The BBC's Chris Foxx learns about the tool The UK government has unveiled a tool it says can accurately detect jihadist content and block it from being viewed. Home Secretary Amber Rudd told the BBC she would not rule out forcing technology companies to use it by law. Ms Rudd is visiting the US to meet tech companies to discuss the idea, as well as other efforts to tackle extremism. Thousands of hours of content posted by the Islamic State group was run past  the tool, in order to ""train"" it to automatically spot extremist material. This video can not be played WATCH: Home Secretary Amber Rudd on new terror tool The government provided Â£600,000 of public funds towards the creation of the tool by an artificial intelligence company based in London. ASI Data Science said the software can be configured to detect 94% of IS video uploads. Anything the software identifies as potential IS material would be flagged up for a human decision to be taken. The company said it typically flagged 0.005% of non-IS video uploads. On a site with five million daily uploads, it would flag 250 non-IS videos for review. It is intended to lighten the moderation burden faced by small companies that may not have the resources to effectively tackle extremist material being posted on their sites. Similar tools in the past have been heavily criticised by advocates of an ""open"" internet, saying such efforts can produce false positives - and that means content that is not particularly problematic ends up being taken down or blocked. In London, reporters were given an off-the-record briefing detailing how ASI's software worked, but were asked not to share its precise methodology. However, in simple terms, it is an algorithm that draws on characteristics typical of IS and its online activity. PM seeks 'safe and ethical' artificial intelligence How terror groups hijacked social media Facebook's AI wipes terrorism-related posts Islamic State piggybacks Baaz's social mega-feed In Silicon Valley, the home secretary told the BBC the tool was made as a way to demonstrate that the government's demand for a clampdown on extremist activity was not unreasonable. ""It's a very convincing example of the fact that you can have the information you need to make sure this material doesn't go online in the first place,"" she said. ""The technology is there. There are tools out there that can do exactly what we're asking for. For smaller companies, this could be ideal."" Silicon Valley giants such as Facebook and Google are pouring their own resources into solving this problem, but this tool is at first intended to be used by small companies, and they may one day be forced to use it. ""We're not going to rule out taking legislative action if we need to do it,"" the home secretary said. ""But I remain convinced that the best way to take real action, to have the best outcomes, is to have an industry-led forum like the one we've got."" The Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism, launched last year, brings together several governments including the US and UK, and major internet firms like Facebook, Google, Twitter and others. However, the bigger challenge is predicting which parts of the internet that jihadis will use next. The Home Office estimates that between July and the end of 2017, extremist material appeared in almost 150 web services that had not been used for such propaganda before.

"The British Virgin Islands are home to 11,700 firms owning UK property A quarter of property in England and Wales owned by overseas firms is held by entities registered in the British Virgin Islands, BBC analysis has found. The Caribbean archipelago is the official home of companies that own 23,000 properties - more than any other country. They are owned by 11,700 firms registered in the overseas territory. The finding emerged from BBC analysis conducted of Land Registry data on overseas property ownership. The research found there are around 97,000 properties in England and Wales held by overseas firms, as of January 2018. It adds to concerns that companies registered in British-controlled tax havens have been used to avoid tax.

Note:Property locations are approximate based on the centre point of the postcode they fall into. As such they have been removed when the map is zoomed to the most detailed levels. Ownership information like the company name and country refer to the ultimate owner of the property, not necessarily the person or company that may rent or occupy the property. Map built using Carto. Close behind the British Virgin Islands (BVI), which has a population of just 30,600, are Jersey, Guernsey and the Isle of Man. Of the properties owned by overseas companies in England and Wales, two thirds are registered to firms in the British Virgin Islands, Jersey, Guernsey and the Isle of Man. Many foreign UK property owners are also officially headquartered in Hong Kong, Panama and Ireland. The analysis provides a new picture of ownership of property by overseas companies in England and Wales following a decision last November to make the database public and free to access. It found: Close to half (44%) of all properties owned by overseas companies in England and Wales are located in London More than one in ten (11,500) properties owned by overseas companies in England and Wales are located in the City of Westminster More than 6,000 properties owned by foreign companies are in the London borough of Kensington and Chelsea. The government of the British Virgin Islands said it was incorrect to label the country as a tax haven. It said that there were many practical reasons why UK properties might be owned by companies incorporated in the BVI. It argued that BVI companies can bring together multiple investors and owners, which is useful for big commercial property deals that have investors in more than one country. The BVI also said that it shared ""necessary information"" including ownership details with relevant authorities. Among those entries in the database that disclosed a price, the most expensive was the former headquarters of the Metropolitan Police, New Scotland Yard, at 8-10 Broadway. The site was purchased by the Abu Dhabi Financial Group in 2014 for Â£370m from the Mayor of London's office. But it is officially owned by a Jersey-based company called BL Development. The 1967 multi-storey block has now been demolished to make way for ""a luxury collection of one to five bedroom apartments across six architecturally striking towers"". These range in price from Â£1.5m to more than Â£10m. The leasehold of Admiralty Arch, the former government building off Trafalgar Square that straddles one end of The Mall, was sold to hotel developer Prime Investments for Â£141m. It is registered to a Guernsey-based entity, Admiralty Arch Hotels Ltd. New Scotland Yard While the most expensive buildings are commercial properties such as hotels and office blocks in prime central London locations, many are residential properties rather than business premises. Take Green Street, London W1 - a residential street of highly-desirable four-storey redbrick Victorian terraces, fronted by smart wrought-iron railings. Walking east to west you'll pass one terraced residence owned, according to the latest records, from the Turks and Caicos Islands by a company called Alliance Property Ltd.  Next door is another residence owned by Lily Holding & Finance Inc, registered in BVI. In all, 15 properties on the street are owned by companies registered in the British Virgin Islands, four in Jersey and one in the Isle of Man. Others have owners in Italy, Hong Kong and Singapore. The leasehold of Admiralty Arch is registered to a Guernsey-based entity Accountants used to recommend using an offshore company to overseas buyers of property in the UK as a means of avoiding inheritance tax when the owner passed away. ""Until April 2017, if you weren't resident in the UK and held a residential property via a company it was not counted as being an asset for UK-based inheritance tax purposes. So having a property through an offshore company meant you escaped inheritance tax,"" says Mark Giddens, of accountants and consultants UHY Hacker Young. However, since last year the government announced plans to close the loophole, dramatically reducing the attractions of offshore ownership of residential property. Offshore jurisdictions such as BVI still offer buyers who wish to keep their names out of the public realm greater privacy than they would enjoy if they purchased their property as an individual. While most tax havens have agreed to take part in automatic information exchange, allowing law enforcement agencies to discover the individuals who enjoy beneficial ownership of an offshore company, their names will not appear in the published data. Only about a third of the properties in the dataset have figures for the ""price paid"" by the company. This is because HM Land Registry has only been collecting this information since October 2013, so information on properties sold overseas before then will not have been recorded. Adding up the 27,835 properties whose most recent sale prices we know, the price paid was just over Â£55 billion. Notes:The BBC analysed the January 2018 Overseas Companies Ownership data made public by the HM Land Registry. The data is accurate up to January 2018 and contains around 97,000 title records of freehold and leasehold property in England and Wales, registered to companies incorporated outside the UK.

"This video can not be played Hundreds of people are involved in the search operation Speed sensors that were iced over may have caused a passenger jet to crash near Moscow, killing all 71 people on board, investigators say. The faulty instruments could have given the pilots wrong speed data, Russia's Interstate Aviation Committee said. The Saratov Airlines jet went down minutes after take-off from Moscow's Domodedovo airport on Sunday. More than 1,400 body parts and hundreds of plane fragments have been recovered from the crash site. A preliminary analysis of the on-board flight recorder indicated the plane had problems two-and-a-half minutes after it took off, at an altitude of around 1,300m (4,265ft). The instruments began displaying different speed readings, probably because of iced speed sensors while their heating systems were shut off, the committee said. When the crew detected the issue, they switched off the plane's autopilot. They eventually took the plane into a dive at 30-35 degrees. Who were the victims? Russian media reports said the plane's captain had rejected a de-icing treatment on the plane before take-off. The procedure is optional and the crew's decision is based mainly on the weather conditions. Iced-over speed sensors, known as Pitots, were cited as the likely reason for a 2009 Air France plane crash, which killed 228 people. More than 700 people are involved in the search operation, struggling through deep snow. The emergencies ministry is collecting DNA samples from victims' relatives as part of the identification process of the 65 passengers, including a child and two teenagers, and six crew. Faulty instruments may have caused the crash, investigators say Wreckage and body parts are strewn over a large area - about 30 hectares (74 acres) - near the village of Argunovo, about 80km (50 miles) south-east of Moscow. The Antonov An-148 was en route to Orsk in the Ural mountains and lost contact at 14:27 (11:27 GMT), without sending any emergency call. Russia's Investigative Committee said the plane was intact when it crashed and that an explosion happened on impact. Flight-tracking site Flightradar24 said it descended at the rate of 1,000m (3,300ft) per minute. Air disasters timeline The jet, which was reportedly seven years old, was being flown by an experienced pilot who had 5,000 hours of flying time. A criminal inquiry has been launched. In 2015 the regional airline was banned from operating international flights, after inspectors found someone other than the flight crew in a cockpit. The airline appealed and changed its policy before resuming international charter flights in 2016. Antonov aircraft were first developed in Ukraine, but are also made in Russia. The twin-engine model involved in Sunday's crash had its first flight in 2004. In 2011, one broke up mid-flight during a training flight in the Belgorod region in southern Russia, killing all six crew members on board. The country has suffered two major plane crashes since 2015: A Tu-154 military airliner crashed into the Black Seawith the loss of all 92 people aboard on 25 December 2016, with the disaster blamed on pilot error A Russian Airbus A321 carrying tourists crashed in Sinai, Egypt, with the loss of all 224 people aboard on 31 October 2015; the Islamic State group said it had placed a bomb aboard.

"Police said a black BMW had been seen driving at speed around the car park at Fir Vale School A car crashed into the front entrance of a secondary school at the height of the morning run. The black BMW was seen driving ""at speed"" around the car park of Fir Vale School in Sheffield at about 08:25 GMT before it hit the building. Two men, aged 23 and 20, have been arrested on suspicion of dangerous driving and causing criminal damage. The school, in Owler Lane, has been closed while inquiries are carried out. No-one was injured in the crash. More stories from across Yorkshire One eyewitness described hearing ""kids screaming from the main entrance"" of the school and seeing ""extensive damage"" to the building. The crash happened at about 08:25 GMT Fir Vale School, in Owler Road, has been closed following the crash Det Ch Insp Steve Ashmore, of South Yorkshire Police, said: ""The school will remain closed for the remainder of the day as officers conduct inquiries to establish the exact circumstances surrounding the incident and provide reassurance. ""We are confident that this is an isolated incident and there is no current risk to the school or the surrounding community."" A spokesperson for the school said any children who were unable to go home would be looked after on site. Gill Furniss, MP for Sheffield Brightside and Hillsborough, said she hoped to meet with police to discuss how schools can be protected against similar incidents. She said: ""I am incredibly relieved that on this occasion no-one was harmed. ""As a society, we have a duty to ensure that our young people can learn and live free from danger and an incident such as this must be treated with the utmost seriousness.""

"President Zuma's time in office has been overshadowed by corruption allegations South Africa's ruling African National Congress (ANC) has formally asked President Jacob Zuma to resign, a senior party official has confirmed. The decision to ""recall"" him ""urgently"" followed marathon talks of the ANC's top leadership body. Mr Zuma, 75, agreed to step down, but only in the next three to six months, the official added. Mr Zuma, who has been in power since 2009, has been dogged by corruption allegations. Six reasons why Zuma is under pressure The many trials of Jacob Zuma But he has resisted increasing pressure to quit since December, when Cyril Ramaphosa replaced him as leader of the ANC. Ace Magashule, the ANC's secretary-general, told reporters the ANC's National Executive Committee (NEC) decided the removal should be ""treated with urgency"". ""It is obvious we want Comrade Ramaphosa to come in as the president of South Africa,"" he added. Despite Mr Magashule telling reporters ""the decision is now final"", he revealed Mr Zuma told him that he ""did not believe the NEC has the right"" to make such a ruling. He said the president was expected to respond to the NEC's decision on Wednesday, although they had given him no deadline. Mr Zuma's presidency has been overshadowed by allegations of corruption which he has always vehemently denied. In 2016, South Africa's highest court ruled that Mr Zuma had violated the constitution when he failed to repay government money spent on his private home. Last year the Supreme Court of Appeal ruled that he must face 18 counts of corruption, fraud, racketeering and money-laundering relating to a 1999 arms deal. This video can not be played The Zuma presidency: Scandals and successes More recently, Mr Zuma's links to the wealthy India-born Gupta family, who are alleged to have influenced the government, have caused his popularity to plummet. Both Mr Zuma and the Guptas deny the allegations. Correspondents say it will be very difficult for him to resist a formal request to resign but he would not be legally obliged to do so and could technically carry on as president despite losing the faith of his party. However, he would then be expected to face a confidence vote in parliament. This has been scheduled for 22 February, but it could be held earlier. Mr Zuma has survived other such votes but he is not expected to pull it off again. A confidence vote would be considered a humiliating process for him and the party. South African media are calling President Zuma's seemingly inevitable exit ""Zexit"". His predecessor, Thabo Mbeki, resigned in 2008, also after a power struggle with his deputy. The deputy in question was Jacob Zuma, who took over the presidency the following year. The ANC was badly rattled by its performance at the 2016 local elections whenit won its lowest share of the vote since coming to power under the late Nelson Mandela in 1994. It wants to project a fresh image for next year's general election. Having served two terms in office (South African presidents are elected by parliament), Mr Zuma cannot legally return to power in any case. On Monday, opposition parties called for an early election. ""Anyone from the ANC that wants to lead this country, must get their mandate from the people of South Africa,"" Democratic Alliance leader Mmusi Maimane told reporters.

"More first-time buyers took out mortgages in 2017 than in any year since the financial crisis. There were 365,000 first-time buyers in the UK, the highest number since 2006 and an increase of 7.4% compared with 2016, UK Finance said. Yet this growth is expected to cool in 2018, the lenders' trade body said. The buy-to-let market was also ""less buoyant"", it said. Separate official data shows UK house prices rose by 5.2% in 2017. The figures, from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), showed that the 4.8% rise in the price of properties bought by first-time buyers was a slower rise than elsewhere in the market. Your biggest financial decision - in 10 charts Firms on Caribbean island chain own 23,000 UK properties UK inflation still at 3% despite fall in food prices The average first-time buyer taking out a mortgage was aged 30 and had an annual household income - either one individual or jointly as a couple - of Â£41,000, UK Finance said. ""Although the [mortgage] market remains competitive [for first-time buyers], there is no room for complacency, with weaker December figures consistent with our market forecast of subdued growth this year,"" said Paul Smee, head of mortgages at UK Finance. The figures show that the average home mover was aged 39 and had an annual income of Â£55,000. However, the numbers of those moving dropped by 3% in 2017 compared with the previous year. The number of new buy-to-let mortgages dropped by 17% year-on-year, while the number of landlords remortgaging was down by nearly 12%. Landlords have faced more stringent tax demands. The average home in the UK costs Â£226,756, according to the ONS. This value rose faster than prices in general, as measured by inflation, in 2017. Accountancy firm PwC said that the figures showed UK house prices had increased by 22% more than earnings between 2012 and 2017. ""This shows that house price growth has outpaced average earnings growth for the fifth consecutive year, further ratcheting up the affordability challenge,"" said Richard Snook, senior economist at PwC. However, the picture is very mixed across the country. London, where the average property still costs significantly more than elsewhere, at Â£484,173, saw the slowest annual house price growth of 2.5%, according to the ONS. This slowdown was showing some signs of shifting to the South East commuter belt, where house prices dropped by 0.5% in December compared with November. Scotland saw the fastest year-on-year rise in prices, up 7.7%, taking the average house price to Â£149,000. Another set of ONS data shows that rent paid by tenants in Britain to private landlords rose by 1.1% in the year to January 2018, down from a 1.2% annual rise the previous month.

"This video can not be played A BBC News NI investigation reveals the self-styled 'paedophile hunters' Some of the leaders of self-styled paedophile-hunting groups operating in Northern Ireland have been identified for the first time. There are increasing concerns about the methods many of the groups use, and their lack of accountability. The so-called paedophile-hunting groups target people online who they believe are sexual predators. They confront them and broadcast the encounter live on the internet, then call the police. There have been more than 100 incidents of that nature reported to police in Northern Ireland, but no-one has been charged as a result and there have been no convictions. This video can not be played BBC News NI's Kevin Magee tries to speak to Sharon Shanks Former senior police officer and child protection expert Jim Gamble warned that some of the tactics used by the groups are criminal. ""Anyone live streaming these incidents is not about the justice of catching someone who represents a threat to children,"" he said. ""They are about the self-publicity and the self-centred approach about themselves, much more than about making children safer."" All of the groups keep their identities hidden. BBC News NI approached two of the people involved in setting up the ""hunting groups"" in Northern Ireland to ask them for an interview. This video can not be played BBC News NI's Kevin Magee tries to speak to self-styled paedophile hunter George Keenan Sharon Shanks, from south Belfast, is behind the group called Justice Reborn Northern Ireland and she uses the alias Chelsea Lewis. Ms Shanks declined to do an interview, saying in an online message that she was unhappy that ""journalists and news stations have so far called the hunting groups vigilantes"". ""Our identity we keep to ourselves so meeting isn't an option,"" she said. During one confrontation that she posted live online, Ms Shanks is overheard using explicit offensive language and threats of violence against a man who came across the scene. When approached by the BBC just after she had broadcast other live footage on Facebook of herself interrogating a man she had alleged was a paedophile, Ms Shanks refused to answer our questions. We wanted to ask about the methods her secret group used, and on whose authority she had been detaining people who she believed to be paedophiles. This video can not be played BBC News NI Investigations Reporter Kevin Magee is confronted by self-styled paedophile hunters She declined to answer any questions. Instead, Ms Shanks pulled on a scarf and was driven way at speed. There are up to 10 different, self-appointed paedophile hunting groups operating in Northern Ireland. Often they are in competition with one another, but sometimes they join forces. One of those who introduced the concept of ""paedophile hunting"" to Northern Ireland is 34-year-old Belfast man George Keenan. He uses the alias James SJ O'Neill and was linked to a group calling itself Silent Justice. Sharon Shanks was driven away after refusing to speak to BBC News NI One of his targets last August was a man in County Antrim. Two days after he was confronted, the man took his own life. His family said they wanted to maintain a dignified silence. Mr Keenan recently had a public falling out with other paedophile hunting groups in England and, in an expletive filled video, issued various threats of physical violence against them on Facebook. Mr Keenan declined a request for an interview using his own name and identity. BBC News NI approached him in west Belfast to ask him on whose authority he was confronting people he thought were paedophiles. BBC News NI's Kevin Magee was filmed by George Keenan, who posted a video of the confrontation online When asked if any of his actions resembled those of a vigilante, he replied: ""Are you serious? Get out of my sight, leave me alone. ""Stay away from anybody that I have previously worked with. ""You are harassing people, I am not here to answer your questions. ""You are absolutely disgusting. Get out of my space right now."" Later the same day, Mr Keenan led a group of people to confront BBC investigations reporter Kevin Magee in a coffee shop in Belfast. Mr Keenan claimed he had been able to mobilise more than a dozen people from various paedophile hunting groups. For a short time they blocked off Botanic Avenue and published the episode online. A mother-of-two has told of her terror when her home was mistakenly surrounded by a group of masked paedophile hunters. The self-appointed gang surrounded the house in the Springfarm estate in Antrim in January, claiming that a paedophile was living there. But the group had made a mistake - they had picked the wrong house. The 34-year-old woman, who asked not to be named, said she was ""absolutely terrified"" when members of the gang approached her home. Her 66-year-old mother and two young children, aged seven and three, were in the house with her. This video can not be played Seamus Davis: ""They called me a paedophile lover"" ""A crowd of people got out of cars and they started banging and kicking at my front door - one of the women was screaming,"" she said. ""They were all saying there was a paedophile in the house, but there was no man in the house, just me, my kids and my mother. ""It was terrible, it really was outrageous behaviour - we felt really intimidated. ""One of the children was hiding under the bed and my mother was petrified and shaken afterwards. ""Now she doesn't want to leave the house."" The woman had only recently moved into the house. Neighbourhood watch co-ordinator Seamus Davis went to the house when he heard the commotion. He said: ""There were three or four cars full of people. ""I said: 'Look you're in the wrong place' - and they called me a paedophile lover. ""I told them I hate paedophiles as much as anybody else, but this way you are doing is totally wrong - this is a job for the police. ""You are behaving like a bunch of vigilantes.""

"This video can not be played WATCH: The BBC's Chris Foxx learns about the tool The UK government has unveiled a tool it says can accurately detect jihadist content and block it from being viewed. Home Secretary Amber Rudd told the BBC she would not rule out forcing technology companies to use it by law. Ms Rudd is visiting the US to meet tech companies to discuss the idea, as well as other efforts to tackle extremism. Thousands of hours of content posted by the Islamic State group was run past  the tool, in order to ""train"" it to automatically spot extremist material. This video can not be played WATCH: Home Secretary Amber Rudd on new terror tool The government provided Â£600,000 of public funds towards the creation of the tool by an artificial intelligence company based in London. ASI Data Science said the software can be configured to detect 94% of IS video uploads. Anything the software identifies as potential IS material would be flagged up for a human decision to be taken. The company said it typically flagged 0.005% of non-IS video uploads. On a site with five million daily uploads, it would flag 250 non-IS videos for review. It is intended to lighten the moderation burden faced by small companies that may not have the resources to effectively tackle extremist material being posted on their sites. Similar tools in the past have been heavily criticised by advocates of an ""open"" internet, saying such efforts can produce false positives - and that means content that is not particularly problematic ends up being taken down or blocked. In London, reporters were given an off-the-record briefing detailing how ASI's software worked, but were asked not to share its precise methodology. However, in simple terms, it is an algorithm that draws on characteristics typical of IS and its online activity. PM seeks 'safe and ethical' artificial intelligence How terror groups hijacked social media Facebook's AI wipes terrorism-related posts Islamic State piggybacks Baaz's social mega-feed In Silicon Valley, the home secretary told the BBC the tool was made as a way to demonstrate that the government's demand for a clampdown on extremist activity was not unreasonable. ""It's a very convincing example of the fact that you can have the information you need to make sure this material doesn't go online in the first place,"" she said. ""The technology is there. There are tools out there that can do exactly what we're asking for. For smaller companies, this could be ideal."" Silicon Valley giants such as Facebook and Google are pouring their own resources into solving this problem, but this tool is at first intended to be used by small companies, and they may one day be forced to use it. ""We're not going to rule out taking legislative action if we need to do it,"" the home secretary said. ""But I remain convinced that the best way to take real action, to have the best outcomes, is to have an industry-led forum like the one we've got."" The Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism, launched last year, brings together several governments including the US and UK, and major internet firms like Facebook, Google, Twitter and others. However, the bigger challenge is predicting which parts of the internet that jihadis will use next. The Home Office estimates that between July and the end of 2017, extremist material appeared in almost 150 web services that had not been used for such propaganda before.

"One of the UK's largest industry exhibitions is issuing a new code of conduct over the use of ""promo girls"". Last year, UK Construction Week, held at Birmingham's NEC, faced criticism over the use of lightly clad women to staff an exhibitor's stall. It featured Las Vegas-style showgirls selling roofing products. Criticism of sexism at business and sports events has grown following the Financial Times' report into the President's Club ball last month. Since then, promoters of darts championships and Formula One have said they will no longer use lightly dressed young women to adorn their events. But some sectors are still using women in revealing outfits. Last week, it emerged some women working at the ICE Totally Gaming event were wearing ""little more than swimsuits"", while men wore smart suits. Others insist the practice is an intrinsic part of the way they do things. UK Construction Week attracts more than 600 exhibitors and attracts more than 35,000 people every October. The industry in recent years has run campaigns highlighting diversity in the industry and employed strategies to attract women into construction professions in order to plug skills gaps. The sight of the show girls at the October 2017 event prompted one visitor to the show to ask: ""How many hot pants do you need?"" Now the show is introducing guidelines on diversity, equality and inclusion,externaland a code of conduct for exhibitors, including on the design and staffing of stands, as well as the clothing worn. It also warns that if an exhibitor's stand theme is deemed inappropriate or doesn't comply with its equality, diversity and inclusion policy, they may not be permitted to open their stand at the event. The new guide urges exhibitors to ""Consider the mix of staff you have on the stand (gender, age, ethnicity etc). Do they represent the diversity of your company, and if not, be prepared to explain why not?"" Nathan Garnett, event director of UK Construction Week, told the BBC the Las Vegas-themed stand was a one-off: ""We had standard guidelines. We understand it was a mistake, but we've turned it in to a positive. ""The company in question has apologised for what's happened. The theme of the stand was 'Why gamble?' but it went too far."" A growing number of events and how they treat women are attracting closer scrutiny. The annual show for the international property industry, Mipim, which is held in Cannes each year, is facing accusations of being a sexist and male-dominated event. Several women I have spoken to have described the event as ""uncomfortable"" and ""laddish"", with a tradition of heavy drinking at parties on yachts and at hotels. Local sex workers allegedly used the conference's Twitter hashtag to attract customers at last year's event, but a spokesman for Mipim strongly denied accusations that prostitutes had actually attended last year's conference. He said: ""Under no circumstances does Mipim register prostitutes"" at the event. Which sports still use 'walk-on girls'?

"Tour operator Thomas Cook is resuming flights to Tunisia for UK customers for the first time since the 2015 beach attack in which 30 Britons were killed. Three full planes, each carrying 220 passengers, are flying to Enfidha this week after the Foreign and Commonwealth Office eased its travel advice. The FCO had advised against all but essential visits following the attack. Security has been increased at hotels and resorts in the country, which attracted 440,000 UK visitors in 2014. Thomas Cook has continued to fly German, French and Belgian holidaymakers to Tunisia, because their governments did not issue similar advice. This video can not be played Thomas Cook chief Peter Fankhauser says it is doing all it can to help UK customers feel safe in Tunisia. The company has been receiving feedback from these tourists and chief executive Peter Fankhauser toldBBC Radio 4's Today programmethey said the security guards were ""very friendly and nice to them"". He added: ""They don't feel they are in a military zone and feel they can enjoy their holidays."" Mr Fankhauser said his company was doing its best to make UK tourists feel at ease in Tunisia. ""It would be foolish of me to say that any destination is 100% safe, but what I can say is that we have taken time to make the decision to prepare our programme. ""It's a modest programme and we offer 10 hotels which are really up to our standards. ""We are confident we have done everything we can do as a tour operator to make the holiday experience as nice as possible for our customers.

UK government relaxes travel advice for Tunisia Tunisia attack survivor: 'I've had the same nightmare 50 times' A Thomas Cook spokesman told the BBC they had not needed to discount prices to attract people to visit Tunisia. ""We've always had good demand for these holidays and Tunisia has always been a good value destination,"" he said. He added that the company had so far taken 15,000 UK bookings up to the end of the summer. An Easter holiday for a family of four to a Thomas Cook own brand hotel in Tunisia would cost about Â£2,000, roughly Â£250 per person cheaper than a similar holiday in Gran Canaria in Spain. Flights from Birmingham and Manchester were leaving on Tuesday, with another going out from Gatwick on Wednesday. The company will continue to fly out three planes each week until April, when a flight from Glasgow will be added. By May, there will be six flights each week, with Stansted and Newcastle added to the list of departure points. This video can not be played Tunisian police raid suspected terrorist hideout Britain's ambassador to Tunis, Louise de Sousa, said when asked if Tunisia is safe enough now for British tourists to return: ""No country can be 100% safe [from terrorism]. ""But we are satisfied that Tunisia has made substantial progress and I would encourage Britons to come and visit. This country has so much to offer."" However, Alan Bowen, an adviser for the African Travel and Tourism Association, told the BBC he wouldn't visit the country. ""It's a very brave move starting these flights,"" he said. ""Tunisia has improved security, but the country borders Libya, which is in a state of chaos. ""I wouldn't go because I don't think it's safe."" BBC News website readers who contacted us on the whole had no qualms about visiting the country, with several saying they have ""never felt unsafe"" there. Samantha Leakey was in Sousse when the 2015 attack happened. She told the BBC: ""I went back a month later and have been going there every six to eight weeks ever since. I feel safer walking alone in the streets of Sousse than I do in my home town in the UK."" Sabrine Herridge said: ""I have visited Tunisia each year since the attacks. I have already booked my ticket for this summer and will be spending three-and-a-half weeks visiting different areas. They rely on our tourism, and hopefully these new packages will encourage people to give the country a second chance."" Charlotte James said: ""My husband and I have booked our summer holiday to Tunisia in June. I don't think any country is truly safe from terrorism. In Britain alone we've had many terrorist attacks, yet people continue to come here for their holidays. If you spend your life living in fear, you'll never go on holiday anywhere."" Marc Scott admitted that he and his partner were ""a bit apprehensive"" before booking a holiday in Tunisia, but said: ""We then realised if we lived our lives with fear of what other people may do, then that isn't living at all. Terrorism can strike at any moment anywhere, so now I am not worried in the slightest, I'm just excited."" Is it safe to go on holiday in Tunisia?

"This handout photo by KCNA shows Kim Jong-un, who appears to be supported by Ms Kim Yo-jong on his left and Mr Kim Yong-nam on his right North Korea's leader has called for a ""further livening up"" of the ""warm climate of reconciliation"" with the South created by the Winter Olympics. Kim Jong-un, whose nuclear bomb and missile tests have stoked international tension, praised the South for hosting his state at the games in Pyeongchang. Kim's apparent Games charm offensive was led by his sister Kim Yo-jong. South Korean President President Moon Jae-in has meanwhile said the US is open to talking with the North. He did not elaborate and may have been referring to a remark by US Vice-President Mike Pence on his flight back to Washington from the Games. ""If you want to talk, we'll talk,"" Mr Pence was quoted as saying by the Washington Post.,external While the North's attendance at the Games has been seen as marking a major warming in relations, there have also been concerns that it has allowed it to win a propaganda victory. What a 'casual' photo tells us about N Korea Kim's sister and North Korea's secret weapon North Korean cheerleaders mesmerise crowds He thanked the South for ""specially prioritising"" the North's attendance at the Games, North Korean state news agency KCNA reports. Ms Kim's visit has been one of the most talked-about aspects of the Games He also gave ""important instructions"" on how to ""liven up"" the ""warm climate of reconciliation and dialogue"". A picture released by the agency shows Mr Kim flanked by his sister and the North's ceremonial head of state, Kim Yong-nam, both linking arms with him. Ms Kim and Mr Kim Yong-nam made up the most senior delegation from the North to visit the South since the Korean War in the 1950s. The two states have never signed a peace treaty and are in a constant state of mutual distrust. On Saturday, Ms Kim handed over a letter from her brother to President Moon, inviting him to visit Pyongyang.

By Laura Bicker, BBC News, Pyeongchang, South Korea You could almost feel the ripple of excitement as Kim Yo-jong walked into the opening ceremony of the Winter Olympic Games. Necks craned and mobile phones were held aloft to catch a glimpse. I found myself, along with others, leaning as far as I could over the balcony to try to see her in the VIP box below.

""I am aware that some people argue that because North Korea is engaging in dialogue we should reward them,"" Foreign Minister Taro Kono said before the Games. ""Frankly I think this view is too naive. I believe that North Korea wants to buy some time to continue their nuclear missile programme."" Mr Pence stressed the US would continue imposing sanctions and putting pressure on Pyongyang. North Korea's presence at the Games raised concerns about a propaganda victory ""The point is, no pressure comes off until they are actually doing something that the alliance believes represents a meaningful step toward denuclearization,"" Mr Pence told the Post.

"This video can not be played A BBC News NI investigation reveals the self-styled 'paedophile hunters' Some of the leaders of self-styled paedophile-hunting groups operating in Northern Ireland have been identified for the first time. There are increasing concerns about the methods many of the groups use, and their lack of accountability. The so-called paedophile-hunting groups target people online who they believe are sexual predators. They confront them and broadcast the encounter live on the internet, then call the police. There have been more than 100 incidents of that nature reported to police in Northern Ireland, but no-one has been charged as a result and there have been no convictions. This video can not be played BBC News NI's Kevin Magee tries to speak to Sharon Shanks Former senior police officer and child protection expert Jim Gamble warned that some of the tactics used by the groups are criminal. ""Anyone live streaming these incidents is not about the justice of catching someone who represents a threat to children,"" he said. ""They are about the self-publicity and the self-centred approach about themselves, much more than about making children safer."" All of the groups keep their identities hidden. BBC News NI approached two of the people involved in setting up the ""hunting groups"" in Northern Ireland to ask them for an interview. This video can not be played BBC News NI's Kevin Magee tries to speak to self-styled paedophile hunter George Keenan Sharon Shanks, from south Belfast, is behind the group called Justice Reborn Northern Ireland and she uses the alias Chelsea Lewis. Ms Shanks declined to do an interview, saying in an online message that she was unhappy that ""journalists and news stations have so far called the hunting groups vigilantes"". ""Our identity we keep to ourselves so meeting isn't an option,"" she said. During one confrontation that she posted live online, Ms Shanks is overheard using explicit offensive language and threats of violence against a man who came across the scene. When approached by the BBC just after she had broadcast other live footage on Facebook of herself interrogating a man she had alleged was a paedophile, Ms Shanks refused to answer our questions. We wanted to ask about the methods her secret group used, and on whose authority she had been detaining people who she believed to be paedophiles. This video can not be played BBC News NI Investigations Reporter Kevin Magee is confronted by self-styled paedophile hunters She declined to answer any questions. Instead, Ms Shanks pulled on a scarf and was driven way at speed. There are up to 10 different, self-appointed paedophile hunting groups operating in Northern Ireland. Often they are in competition with one another, but sometimes they join forces. One of those who introduced the concept of ""paedophile hunting"" to Northern Ireland is 34-year-old Belfast man George Keenan. He uses the alias James SJ O'Neill and was linked to a group calling itself Silent Justice. Sharon Shanks was driven away after refusing to speak to BBC News NI One of his targets last August was a man in County Antrim. Two days after he was confronted, the man took his own life. His family said they wanted to maintain a dignified silence. Mr Keenan recently had a public falling out with other paedophile hunting groups in England and, in an expletive filled video, issued various threats of physical violence against them on Facebook. Mr Keenan declined a request for an interview using his own name and identity. BBC News NI approached him in west Belfast to ask him on whose authority he was confronting people he thought were paedophiles. BBC News NI's Kevin Magee was filmed by George Keenan, who posted a video of the confrontation online When asked if any of his actions resembled those of a vigilante, he replied: ""Are you serious? Get out of my sight, leave me alone. ""Stay away from anybody that I have previously worked with. ""You are harassing people, I am not here to answer your questions. ""You are absolutely disgusting. Get out of my space right now."" Later the same day, Mr Keenan led a group of people to confront BBC investigations reporter Kevin Magee in a coffee shop in Belfast. Mr Keenan claimed he had been able to mobilise more than a dozen people from various paedophile hunting groups. For a short time they blocked off Botanic Avenue and published the episode online. A mother-of-two has told of her terror when her home was mistakenly surrounded by a group of masked paedophile hunters. The self-appointed gang surrounded the house in the Springfarm estate in Antrim in January, claiming that a paedophile was living there. But the group had made a mistake - they had picked the wrong house. The 34-year-old woman, who asked not to be named, said she was ""absolutely terrified"" when members of the gang approached her home. Her 66-year-old mother and two young children, aged seven and three, were in the house with her. This video can not be played Seamus Davis: ""They called me a paedophile lover"" ""A crowd of people got out of cars and they started banging and kicking at my front door - one of the women was screaming,"" she said. ""They were all saying there was a paedophile in the house, but there was no man in the house, just me, my kids and my mother. ""It was terrible, it really was outrageous behaviour - we felt really intimidated. ""One of the children was hiding under the bed and my mother was petrified and shaken afterwards. ""Now she doesn't want to leave the house."" The woman had only recently moved into the house. Neighbourhood watch co-ordinator Seamus Davis went to the house when he heard the commotion. He said: ""There were three or four cars full of people. ""I said: 'Look you're in the wrong place' - and they called me a paedophile lover. ""I told them I hate paedophiles as much as anybody else, but this way you are doing is totally wrong - this is a job for the police. ""You are behaving like a bunch of vigilantes.""

"This video can not be played Ben Stokes appeared at Bristol Magistrates' Court England cricketer Ben Stokes is to go on trial after being accused of fighting outside a Bristol nightclub in September. The 26-year-old Durham all-rounder is charged with affray after a man allegedly suffered a broken eye socket. Mr Stokes, who missedthe Ashesafter being suspended from England duties, is accused jointly with two others. Ryan Hale, 26, and 28-year-old Ryan Aslam Ali, both from Bristol, will face trial on the same charge. Mr Stokes was granted unconditional bail after appearing at Bristol Magistrates' Court and isnow set to travel to New Zealand to re-join the England squadas part of their Twenty20 tri-series. The three defendants were detained early on 25 September following a disturbance in the Clifton Triangle area of the city - several hours after England had played a one-day international against the West Indies. District Judge Simon Cooper, who also granted Mr Hale and Mr Ali unconditional bail, sent the case to trial at Bristol Crown Court. The first hearing, which Mr Stokes is not expected to attend, is due on 12 March. Mr Stokes' court appearance had clashed withEngland's defeat earlier to New Zealand, in which he had been due to make his international comeback. Ben Stokes arriving at court in Bristol on Tuesday morning In a statement posted on Twitter last month the player, from the Castle Eden area of Durham, said he was ""keen to have an opportunity to clear my name"". As a result of the charge, Mr Stokes missed the Ashes series, which hosts Australia won 4-0, although he was allowed to play some domestic matches in New Zealand. The charge of affray is made under the Public Order Act 1986 and effectively relates to fighting in public. It is a triable either-way offence, which means it can be heard in either the magistrates' court or the crown court. It carries a maximum penalty when tried summarily - in the magistrates' court - of a fine or up to six months in prison, and when tried on indictment - in the crown court - of up to three years in prison. He has also beengiven permissionby the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) to take part in the Indian Premier League, which starts in April. Last month, the ECB said that, ""given the potential length of time to trial"", it would not be ""fair, reasonable or proportionate for Ben Stokes to remain unavailable for a further indeterminate period"".

"Ukraine, one of Europe's poorest nations, is fast becoming the place to go for people desperate to find a surrogate to have their baby. The money on offer is drawing in many young women, but there are fears they could be exploited. Ana* was 18 years old when she found out about surrogacy from a television news report. She had just finished secondary school and had plans to work in a hotel in her small western Ukrainian town, where tourists come to see a medieval castle. That job pays $200 a month, but for carrying someone else's baby, she learned, she could earn up to $20,000 (Â£14,000). Ana's family is not poor by local standards. Her mother is an accountant and has always supported her. But she says she was drawn to surrogacy because she ""wanted to have something more"", to be able to afford ""expensive things"" - house renovations, a car, appliances. Ana stirs her latte nervously as she talks. Although hundreds of women are doing it, surrogacy is still not talked about openly in Ukraine. This video can not be played Surrogate mothers must be very careful, says 23-year-old Ana Foreign couples have been coming to this corner of Europe in droves since 2015, when surrogacy hotspots in Asia began closing their industries one-by-one, amid reports of exploitation. Barred from India, Nepal and Thailand, they turned to Ukraine, one of the few places left where surrogacy can still be arranged at a fraction of what it costs in the US. ""We have so many childless couples coming to our country - it's like a conveyor belt,"" says Ana, who asked for her identity to be protected. When she was 21, and after some years of hotel work, Ana finally decided to become a surrogate. By then she had a daughter and realised she was eligible. Under Ukrainian law, a surrogate must have a child of their own before carrying someone else's. If you have your own child, you are less likely to become attached to the one you must give away, those who recruit the women say. Ana hopes to buy a flat for her daughter in her hometown, Kamyanets-Podilskyi Ana began trawling the websites where surrogates, agents, clinics and assorted middlemen post advertisements. Soon she was 450km (280 miles) away, in the capital Kiev, for health checks. She signed a contract with a couple from Slovenia unable to have their own child. Ana was lucky - an embryo implanted in her uterus the first time she underwent the taxing transfer process. But it was then that the difficulties started. She says the quality of care provided by the clinic went downhill quickly. Some surrogates had health problems that were not diagnosed correctly or treated on time, leading to complications, she says. She posted her complaints online to warn other women but was rebuked by the clinic and remains too nervous to name them publicly. The baby she delivered was born healthy but the experience left Ana wary. Still, she has now agreed to be a surrogate again, this time for a Japanese couple. They are handling things through a lawyer in Kiev and she will likely never meet them in person. Ana has been more prudent in her choice of clinic this time around, but if all goes to plan, by the age of 24 she will have given birth to three children - one of her own, and two for someone else. Demand for surrogacy in Ukraine ""has increased probably 1000% in the last two years alone,"" says Sam Everingham of Families Through Surrogacy, a Sydney-based charity that advises would-be parents. The country, he adds, ""has found itself almost accidentally as one of the handful of nation states"" which allow surrogacy tourism. Apart from the simple fact that it is legal, Ukraine's liberal laws attract people. It recognises the ""intending parents"" as the biological parents from the moment of conception and places no limit on how much a surrogate may be paid - essentially creating an open market where women can demand their chosen price. But that does not mean it is straightforward. Depending where you come from, the process of actually getting the baby out of Ukraine can be a bureaucratic nightmare, with couples from some countries, including the UK, needing to stay there for many months. Clinics like the Ilaya medical centre in Kiev draw clients from all over the world While many clinics in Ukraine appear to be operating transparently and treating the women well, industry insiders and surrogates will whisper about those with bad reputations. There are unverified stories of embryos being secretly swapped, poor health screenings and operators taking on too many clients to be able to offer the adequate level of care. Surrogacy: What, where, why? The Americans who 'adopt' other people's embryos ""We have seen examples where Ukrainian agencies have refused to pay the surrogate if she doesn't adhere to strict requirements, if she miscarries,"" says Mr Everingham. ""There are some awful examples where agencies really treated surrogates dreadfully in Ukraine if things haven't worked out to the benefit of parents."" Surrogates travel to Kiev from their hometowns for regular check-ups Olga Bogomolets, a doctor and MP who chairs Ukraine's parliamentary committee on health, said she believed young women were being drawn into surrogacy ""as a result of the rapid fall in living standards"" in the country. The economy was hit by a deep recession in 2014 and 2015, in part because of the ongoing conflict in eastern Ukraine between the military and Russia-backed separatists. The industry, Ms Bogomolets says, is not sufficiently regulated and this lack of oversight can put both surrogate mothers and the paying parents at risk. The Ukrainian health ministry has not responded to requests for comment. Available to heterosexual, married couples able to prove they cannot carry a baby themselves for medical reasons At least one parent must have a genetic link to the baby; egg donors are frequently used Costs vary, but range from $30,000-$45,000 on average The paying parents are on the Ukrainian birth certificate; the surrogate has no legal right to claim custody of the baby It is estimated about 500 surrogacies may be happening every year but there is a lack of available data Commercial surrogacy of this kind is legal in the US, Georgia and Russia. Kenya and Laos are also destinations but have no laws in place There are hundreds of listings like this on surrogacy agency websites For Mark, who travelled with his wife from Ireland to Ukraine for surrogacy in late 2015, the choice of agency and clinic was crucial. His experience was overwhelmingly positive. His son was born in 2016 after IVF using his sperm and a donor egg, and he says the healthcare was as good as anywhere in Western Europe. They had a warm relationship with the 32-year-old surrogate - who they paid directly - and his wife was invited into the room during the birth. ""At no point, from the clinic or the maternity house, did we get the feeling [the surrogate] was treated as a second-class citizen,"" says Mark. ""We knew why she was doing this,"" he adds. ""She had a daughter - she got pregnant when she was 15. She wanted to send her to college and have an opportunity she could never have."" Mark's son was born in 2016. Going to Ukraine was the ""most important thing"" he has ever done For a couple sitting in London, Dublin or Shanghai, the decision to go ahead with surrogacy in Ukraine is fraught with uncertainty. Parents rely on online forums to find out which clinics have the best reputations, and trade stories - both good and bad - about their experiences. But at least one clinic is known to pay disgruntled parents ""significant sums to write glowing reviews"", says Mr Everingham, making it even harder for people to know who to trust. The Ilaya medical centre in Kiev, from all appearances, is not the kind of clinic that would need to do that. It says its ""very good reputation"" attracts a waiting list of surrogates. Womb for rent: A tale of two mothers Mixed-race surrogate baby 'returned' In a waiting room at the gleaming facility, two women from the east of the country discuss their pregnancies. Tetiana, a red-haired mother of three, is 30 weeks pregnant with a baby for a Spanish couple. ""You feel the baby kicking, and you are talking to him,"" she says of the experience of carrying someone else's child. ""But subconsciously, you realise it's not yours."" Tetiana visits the Ilaya clinic for a check-up Tetiana lives with her mother but has hidden the pregnancy from her, saying she wanted to move to Kiev to look for work. Jana, who gave birth two months ago, advises Tetiana that she must see the surrogacy as just a job. She remembers the child she carried being taken away almost immediately after the birth, as she lay exhausted in her hospital bed. She admits that maternal feelings lingered, and she thought about the child after she returned home. ""You would have to be a cold person not to feel this,"" she says. ""But when you see the joy and smiles of the biological parents, that's it. You realise everything is okay with the child and the parents are happy."" Back at home with her own daughter in western Ukraine, Ana is also thinking about her role as a surrogate. Soon, she will take a seven-hour train to Kiev for an embryo transfer attempt for the new Japanese couple. Although it can be one of the hardest parts of the process, she is in an upbeat mood about what awaits her. She hopes she can use the money to buy her own flat. But Ana is also proud of what she can do for the paying parents. ""When they are crying and thanking you, you feel how much you have done for them,"" she says. ""[They] told me that I was the most important person in their lives.""

"BiFab was saved from administration following Scottish government intervention last year Union representatives have said the BiFab marine engineering yards in Fife and on Lewis could close by the end of June. They have been told by managers at the yards that redundancy notices will be given to the core workforce on Tuesday. The Unite union said it expects about 260 jobs to go, with redundancies beginning in May. The Scottish government has said it will offer practical support to those who lose their jobs. The union said it has been told the decision will only be reversed if new contracts for work are signed. Unite regional officer Bob McGregor said: ""So much has been done to save these yards until now. ""The workers there have fought for their future and it is difficult to believe that it can now be snatched away from them. ""The closures of these yards will turn these areas into an industrial graveyard. The prospect fills us with dismay."" BiFab, which operates the yards at Burntisland and Arnish, reached an agreement with business partners in November to receive payments to alleviate its ""immediate cash flow issues"". Scotland's economy secretary, Keith Brown, said at the time that if the offer of a Â£15m loan from the Scottish government was required, it would be extended to the firm on commercial terms. Last month, it emerged BiFab was facing legal action from one of its business partners, German firm EEW. Both companies have been working on contracts for the Â£2.6bn Beatrice Offshore Windfarm in the Outer Moray Firth. Nicola Sturgeon said in November that there was ""every reason to be optimistic"" about BiFab's future Mr McGregor added: ""We can't say this is a total shock because work at the yard has been running down for weeks now. ""However all the interested parties, the company, the contractors, the unions and the Scottish government, given what has been done so far, must surely look to have an eleventh hour intervention which can do something to save these jobs."" The Scottish government has committed to supporting efforts to secure the future of the company, while offering support to those made redundant. Economy secretary Keith Brown said: ""This will be hugely concerning for the workers affected and their families - and we stand ready to provide support through our Partnership Action for Continuing Employment (PACE) initiative. ""By providing skills development and employability support, PACE aims to minimise the time individuals affected by redundancy are out of work. He added: ""Ministers recognise that more work remains to be done to secure the long term future of the company and are fully committed to offering support where possible to attract long term investment in this vital sector of the Scottish supply chain and economy."" In November, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon met workers at BiFab where she promised that the Scottish government would play its ""full part in trying to secure the longer term future of this company"". She said at the time: ""There is every reason to be optimistic, but that doesn't mean there is not a lot of work that needs to be done including investment that needs to be done to secure it.""

"The Charity Commission is to begin an investigation into Oxfam's handling of a sex scandal in which staff hired prostitutes in Haiti in 2011. The watchdog has concerns the charity may not have ""full and frankly disclosed material details"". It comes after Oxfam'sdeputy chief executive Penny Lawrence quitover the charity's response to the revelations. And a whistleblower said an Oxfam aid worker was accused of coercing a woman to have sex ""in exchange for aid"". Whistleblower Helen Evans, who worked as Oxfam's global head of safeguarding between 2012 and 2015, made the claim in an interview on Channel 4. Ms Evans, now a Labour councillor in Oxford, also said in a tweet that in the space of one month she had received three allegations of child abuse in Oxfam shops. In the same month she received claims of sexual exploitation against aid beneficiaries, alongside other overseas allegations. She said she ""took her concerns"" to the charity's trustees and was told that management would conduct a ""strategic review"". She said that having ""exhausted all avenues"" available to her internally, she realised ""position with the organisation was no longer tenable"". Ms Evans said she then went to the Charity Commission in 2015, highlighting the allegations abroad and in Oxfam shops, but was left ""extremely disappointed"" by the authority's response. After she approached the watchdog in 2017 she says the body was ""more responsive"" and produced a report from an interview conducted with Ms Evans. Allow Twitter content?

Earlier,International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt threatened to cut government funding for Oxfam projectsif it cannot account for the way it handled claims of sexual misconduct by aid workers. Penny Lawrence resigned from the charity on Monday, saying she was ""ashamed"" and takes full responsibility. Reality check: How much money goes to Oxfam? How will the Haiti scandal affect Oxfam? Oxfam boss says charity is ashamed Oxfam did not disclose 'full Haiti details' ""Concerns were raised about the behaviour of staff in Chad as well as Haiti that we failed to adequately act upon,"" she said in a statement. ""It is now clear that these allegations - involving the use of prostitutes and which related to the behaviour of both the country director and members of his team in Chad - were raised before he moved to Haiti."" This video can not be played Former Oxfam employee Widza Bryant: ""I was told my many locals there were... sexual relations"" The allegations emerged inThe Times,externalon Friday, which said Oxfam's country director for Haiti, Roland van Hauwermeiren, used prostitutes at a villa rented for him by Oxfam in the aftermath of the 2010 earthquake. According to the paper, Oxfam knew about concerns over the conduct of Mr van Hauwermeiren and another man when they worked in Chad before they were given senior roles in Haiti. Oxfam said allegations that underage girls may have been involved were unproven. BBC world affairs correspondent Will Grant said senior government sources feared the abuse allegations could be ""the tip of the iceberg"" and that all aid agencies operating in Haiti as well as Oxfam would be investigated. He added locals expressed ""real anger"" at what they say is impunity by international aid agencies for the way they have behaved. Widza Bryant, who worked in HR for Oxfam in Haiti from 2009 for three years, said she shared ""ongoing rumours"" about locals being exploited with management ""on many occasions"". She told BBC News: ""There were a lot of rumours on the ground about management and leaders exploiting the locals sexually and in other ways to get jobs and to have good standing."" This video can not be played Oxfam Chief Executive: ""We apologise to the British public and the Haitian public"" Mark Goldring, chief executive of Oxfam GB, admitted the charity had failed to act on complaints highlighting the failure to allow Mr van Hauwermeiren to move onto another post after allegations were revealed. He said the use of prostitutes was ""not explicitly contrary"" to Oxfam's code of conduct at the time, but bringing Oxfam into disrepute in any way and abusing people who may have been beneficiaries was. Mr Goldring added: ""There was an exploration of how should the organisation respond but we didn't act on it."" The European Commission has said it expects full clarity and maximum transparency from Oxfam, adding that it is ready to ""cease funding any partner not living up to high ethical standards"". The charity's programme in Haiti received â¬1.7m in EU funds in 2011. International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt said Oxfam had apologised for its ""appalling"" behaviour and that the government had not been told at the time the allegations involved sexual misconduct or beneficiaries. Oxfam has been told to tell the Department for International Development by the end of the week how it will handle any future allegations around safeguarding or it faces losing government funding. Ms Mordaunt also called for clearer whistle-blowing policies across the charitable sector and launched an urgent review into safeguarding and aid providers. The Innocent drinks company - one of Oxfam's corporate sponsors which donates around Â£100,000 per year- said it wants to see a clear plan ""for how this could not ever happen again"". The charity has since postponed a ""Fashion Fighting Poverty"" event, which had been due to take place as part of London Fashion Week on Thursday, saying it was not the ""right time"" at present. This video can not be played BBC world affairs correspondent Will Grant says locals believe aid agencies have enjoyed ""impunity"" Oxfam's own investigation in 2011 led to four people being sacked and three others resigning, including Mr van Hauwermeiren. It produced a public report, which said ""serious misconduct"" had taken place in Haiti - but did not give details of the allegations. Oxfam has faced growing criticism of the way it handled the allegations of misconduct by its staff in Haiti, where they were working in the aftermath of the huge earthquake that devastated the country in 2010. Haiti's ambassador in London Bocchit Edmond called the revelations ""shocking"", ""shameful"", and ""unacceptable"". On Sunday, Ms Mordaunt told the BBC's Andrew Marr the charity did ""absolutely the wrong thing"" by not reporting details of the allegations and that no organisation could be a government partner if it did not ""have the moral leadership to do the right thing"". Ahead of the government meeting, Oxfamannounced new measures,externalfor handling of sexual abuse cases, saying it would introduce tougher vetting of staff and mandatory safeguarding training for new recruits. Oxfam's chairman of trustees, Caroline Thomson, said the charity's board had appointed a consultant earlier this year to review its culture and working practices, which would now be extended.

"A select committee says an absolute price cap on energy bills is required to stop customers from being over-charged The government's planned cap on energy bills should be introduced urgently, to stop customers from being overcharged, a report from MPs says. Competition was not working and had failed to deliver fair prices for consumers, a select committee said. The committee said it was ""underwhelmed by the feeble steps"" taken by energy companies to avoid government action. The cap should be temporary and fixed at an ""absolute"" level, rather than set relative to other tariffs. Legislation should be passed before the summer recess, the report suggested, which should allow the cap to be in place before the end of the year. The Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee has been examining the government's draft bill to cap energy tariffs, following a commitment made last year by Theresa May. ""The Big Six energy companies might whine and wail about the introduction of a price cap,"" said Rachel Reeves, the committee's chairwoman. ""But they've been overcharging their customers on default and standard variable tariffs for years and their recent feeble efforts to move consumers off these tariffs has only served to highlight the need for this intervention."" Energy firms could get welfare data Ofgem boss: I'm sorry for failing vulnerable consumers How many people will the cap on energy prices help? Theresa May revives plan to cap energy prices The report said the larger energy companies had ""brought this policy intervention upon themselves by raising their prices in 2017 and by failing to take effective action against the overcharging of their customers"". The regulator Ofgem was also criticised for being ""too slow and reluctant"" to use its powers to protect the interests of customers. The MPs' report said 12 million customers ""stuck on poor-value"" standard variable and default tariffs were paying up to Â£300 a year more their energy than other people. Standard Variable Tariffs (SVTs) are the most expensive product in the energy market, and customers have been urged to look for cheaper fixed-price deals. But the report said consumers should not be penalised if they did not shop around. Five million of the UK's most vulnerable households, many of whom pay using pre-payment meters, already have their energy bills capped. But with the cost of producing energy expected to rise in the Spring those householdswere recently told they should expect a rise in their energy bills. MPs said customers were not being given enough help to switch to better energy deals An Ofgem spokesperson said it was pressing ahead with plans to protect energy consumers in expectation of the new legislation. The regulator said ""innovative solutions"" such as its scheme to trial""collective switching""which would allow consumers to group together to gain better deals, would help households reduce their energy bills Ofgem said. The Business Secretary, Greg Clark, said the report confirmed that "" the energy market isn't working for customers stuck on rip-off tariffs"". He said that the government's plan to introduce a price cap would protect consumers from high energy bills. MPs backed the government's plan for the cap on standard variable tariffs to be set at an ""absolute"" or fixed level, rather than be ""relative"" or set at a maximum difference to other fixed tariffs available to customers. They said a relative cap might create a perverse incentive for suppliers to increase their lowest prices to maintain overall profits. Richard Neudegg, head of regulation at the price comparison and switching service uSwitch said any price cap might ""do more harm than good"" if it undermined competition between energy companies. ""A widespread price cap could lull energy customers into a false sense of security if they think they are protected by it,"" he said. Energy UK, a body representing the industry said more customers were already switching suppliers to get better deals and that the cap could hamper competition. ""It's also important that the cap accurately reflects suppliers' costs, most of which are out of their direct control,""  said Energy UK's chief executive Lawrence Slade.

"Planes were grounded at London City Airport on Monday following the discovery of the unexploded bomb London City Airport has reopened after an unexploded 500kg World War Two bomb was safely moved from the area. The device was discovered at the King George V Dock on Sunday during planned work at the east London airport. All flights were cancelled on Monday after an exclusion zone was put in place,with the closure affecting up to 16,000 passengers and nearby residents being evacuated from their homes. The bomb is set to be detonated in a controlled explosion on Wednesday. Royal Navy divers worked through the night to move the 1.5m-long German bomb down the Thames. Divers took the device - which was found in a bed of silt, 15m underwater - out to sea. Cdr Del McKnight said it had been taken to the sea bed, a mile away from the coast, before military explosives were placed on it. Detonation, which will take place off Shoeburyness, Essex, was postponed earlier because high winds and a sea swell created dangerous conditions for divers. Cdr Del McKnight said it was ""one of the larger"" German bombs ""The bomb presents no risk to the public in its current location, so we will leave it where it currently sits until tomorrow,"" Cdr McKnight said. ""It's been put in 10m of water so we are expecting quite a large plume when we explode it. ""It's not everyday we find a bomb this big, it is one of the larger bombs the Germans dropped."" Divers have taken the bomb and military explosives out to sea London City Airport's chief executive Robert Sinclair said it would be ""business as usual"" on Tuesday. The airport's terminal building reopened at 04:30 GMT and the runway opened at 06:30. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Mr Sinclair thanked those affected for their ""patience and understanding"" during the disruption. A total of 261 arrivals and departures had been scheduled for Monday. Residents who were evacuated to temporary accommodation have been told they can return to their homes. A tunnel used by some rail services from St Pancras International was also closed around midnight, affecting services. Royal Navy divers helped in the removal operation The Ministry of Defence said bomb disposal teams deal with about 60 German World War Two bombs a year Between September 1940 and May 1941,the Germans dropped about 24,000 tonnes of explosives on London - but 10% of all bombs that dropped did not detonate, according to historians. Last year, more than 4.5 million passengers used London City Airport. A Â£400m expansionwas given the go-ahead by ministers in July 2016, which includes extending the terminal.

"This handout photo by KCNA shows Kim Jong-un, who appears to be supported by Ms Kim Yo-jong on his left and Mr Kim Yong-nam on his right North Korea's leader has called for a ""further livening up"" of the ""warm climate of reconciliation"" with the South created by the Winter Olympics. Kim Jong-un, whose nuclear bomb and missile tests have stoked international tension, praised the South for hosting his state at the games in Pyeongchang. Kim's apparent Games charm offensive was led by his sister Kim Yo-jong. South Korean President President Moon Jae-in has meanwhile said the US is open to talking with the North. He did not elaborate and may have been referring to a remark by US Vice-President Mike Pence on his flight back to Washington from the Games. ""If you want to talk, we'll talk,"" Mr Pence was quoted as saying by the Washington Post.,external While the North's attendance at the Games has been seen as marking a major warming in relations, there have also been concerns that it has allowed it to win a propaganda victory.

Ms Kim's visit has been one of the most talked-about aspects of the Games He also gave ""important instructions"" on how to ""liven up"" the ""warm climate of reconciliation and dialogue"". A picture released by the agency shows Mr Kim flanked by his sister and the North's ceremonial head of state, Kim Yong-nam, both linking arms with him. Ms Kim and Mr Kim Yong-nam made up the most senior delegation from the North to visit the South since the Korean War in the 1950s. The two states have never signed a peace treaty and are in a constant state of mutual distrust.

""I am aware that some people argue that because North Korea is engaging in dialogue we should reward them,"" Foreign Minister Taro Kono said before the Games. ""Frankly I think this view is too naive. I believe that North Korea wants to buy some time to continue their nuclear missile programme."" Mr Pence stressed the US would continue imposing sanctions and putting pressure on Pyongyang. North Korea's presence at the Games raised concerns about a propaganda victory ""The point is, no pressure comes off until they are actually doing something that the alliance believes represents a meaningful step toward denuclearization,"" Mr Pence told the Post.

"Crews are expected to be at the scene for the rest of the day A huge fire which broke out at a north-west London industrial estate on Monday night is now under control. More than 120 firefighters were tackling the blaze at Long Drive, Greenford, for almost 16 hours after they were called at about 23:30 GMT. Four business units were alight, three of which were said to be ""badly affected"", before the fire was put out at about 15:15 GMT. The London Fire Brigade said strong winds had been ""hampering"" its efforts. It said it was ""likely to remain at the scene for the rest of the day"". A spokesman for the service said 35 firefighters and six engines are currently on scene ""as a precaution"" and are expected to remain there for the rest of the evening.

"President Zuma's time in office has been overshadowed by corruption allegations South Africa's ruling African National Congress (ANC) has formally asked President Jacob Zuma to resign, a senior party official has confirmed. The decision to ""recall"" him ""urgently"" followed marathon talks of the ANC's top leadership body. Mr Zuma, 75, agreed to step down, but only in the next three to six months, the official added. Mr Zuma, who has been in power since 2009, has been dogged by corruption allegations. Six reasons why Zuma is under pressure The many trials of Jacob Zuma But he has resisted increasing pressure to quit since December, when Cyril Ramaphosa replaced him as leader of the ANC. Ace Magashule, the ANC's secretary-general, told reporters the ANC's National Executive Committee (NEC) decided the removal should be ""treated with urgency"". ""It is obvious we want Comrade Ramaphosa to come in as the president of South Africa,"" he added. Despite Mr Magashule telling reporters ""the decision is now final"", he revealed Mr Zuma told him that he ""did not believe the NEC has the right"" to make such a ruling. He said the president was expected to respond to the NEC's decision on Wednesday, although they had given him no deadline. Mr Zuma's presidency has been overshadowed by allegations of corruption which he has always vehemently denied. In 2016, South Africa's highest court ruled that Mr Zuma had violated the constitution when he failed to repay government money spent on his private home. Last year the Supreme Court of Appeal ruled that he must face 18 counts of corruption, fraud, racketeering and money-laundering relating to a 1999 arms deal. This video can not be played The Zuma presidency: Scandals and successes More recently, Mr Zuma's links to the wealthy India-born Gupta family, who are alleged to have influenced the government, have caused his popularity to plummet. Both Mr Zuma and the Guptas deny the allegations. Correspondents say it will be very difficult for him to resist a formal request to resign but he would not be legally obliged to do so and could technically carry on as president despite losing the faith of his party. However, he would then be expected to face a confidence vote in parliament. This has been scheduled for 22 February, but it could be held earlier. Mr Zuma has survived other such votes but he is not expected to pull it off again. A confidence vote would be considered a humiliating process for him and the party. South African media are calling President Zuma's seemingly inevitable exit ""Zexit"". His predecessor, Thabo Mbeki, resigned in 2008, also after a power struggle with his deputy. The deputy in question was Jacob Zuma, who took over the presidency the following year. The ANC was badly rattled by its performance at the 2016 local elections whenit won its lowest share of the vote since coming to power under the late Nelson Mandela in 1994. It wants to project a fresh image for next year's general election. Having served two terms in office (South African presidents are elected by parliament), Mr Zuma cannot legally return to power in any case. On Monday, opposition parties called for an early election. ""Anyone from the ANC that wants to lead this country, must get their mandate from the people of South Africa,"" Democratic Alliance leader Mmusi Maimane told reporters.

"This video can not be played The Zuma presidency: Scandals and successes Jacob Zuma has resigned as president of South Africa after facing pressure from his own party to do so. His presidency covered more than a third of South Africa's time after apartheid, but it was dogged by scandal. So what led to him quitting? Here's a timeline of the key events. At this point, Mr Zuma had been a popular and charismatic deputy president of South Africa for six years - buthe lost his job after being implicated in a corruption trial,external. He had long been viewed as a possible successor to then-President Thabo Mbeki. As a teenager, he had joined the fight against apartheid with the African National Congress (ANC) and its underground military wing before being jailed on Robben Island with Nelson Mandela. Mr Mbeki (L) points at his then-deputy Mr Zuma after his first state of the nation address in 1999 In 1997, he became the deputy president of the ruling ANC, and was then named as South Africa's deputy president in 1999. Later, he became embroiled in controversy over a 30bn rand ($5bn; Â£3bn in 2009) arms deal involving a number of European companies. Mr Zuma's financial adviser, Schabir Shaik, went on to be found guilty of corruption and fraud. During the trial, Mr Zuma was implicated in the corruption allegations, and while he has always denied the claims, he lost his job. He was charged in 2007. Mr Zuma's race for the presidency was in its last stretch when prosecutors dropped the charges against him over the arms deal. South Africa's chief prosecutor saidphone-tap evidence suggested the 2007 charges had been politically motivated,external. The main opposition called it an ""abuse"" of the prosecutor's role. However Mr Zuma, by then the president of the ANC, went on to win the presidency of the country two weeks later. This satellite image from 2013 shows the improvements made to Mr Zuma's property South Africa's highest court ruled that Mr Zuma had violated the constitution whenhe failed to repay government money spent on his private home. An anti-corruption body found he had spent $23m (Â£15m) on his rural home in Nkandla in the KwaZulu-Natal province, adding a swimming pool and amphitheatre. He later repaid the money. How Zuma's home has grown Zuma: A president of many trials Not for the first time, he faced calls to stand down. Not for the last time, he didn't. This video can not be played South Africa's 'spy tape' saga explained South Africa's Supreme Court of Appeal ruled that Mr Zuma must face 18 charges of corruption, fraud, racketeering and money laundering relating to the 1999 arms deal. This all came about because the opposition Democratic Alliance brought a case before a Pretoria court, demanding that the president face charges. Mr Zuma lodged an appeal, but lost it. On 16 March 2018 he found himself facing prosecution on 16 of the 18 corruption charges- for 783 instances of alleged wrongdoing. Jacob Zuma - a born survivor? First of all, a Pretoria court ordered Mr Zuma to set up a judicial inquiry into corruption claims against him and his associates, which he eventually did in January. The inquiry was one of the recommendations made by the country's anti-corruption watchdog to curb state influence-peddling, which the president had tried to challenge. Judge Dunstan Mlambo described Mr Zuma's attempt to challenge the rulings as ""ill-advised"" and an abuse of the judicial process. This video can not be played Andrew Harding reports on allegations of high-level corruption in South Africa involving a British PR company Then, separately, a judge ruled the president had abused the judicial process by trying to block a report on corruption. The figures that keep appearing in allegations against Mr Zuma arethe wealthy Indian-born Gupta family, who are accused of using their relationship with the president to influence cabinet appointments and obtain lucrative government contracts. The Guptas and Mr Zuma deny any wrongdoing but the allegations will not go away. The Guptas and their links to Zuma Will 'the Zuptas' fall? This video can not be played Who is Cyril Ramaphosa? In the race to succeed Mr Zuma after 10 years as head of the ANC,Cyril Ramaphosa - South Africa's deputy president - came out on top. He took over the party at a time it was losing popular support under Mr Zuma. He campaigned as the anti-Zuma candidate, promising to target corruption. His victory put him in a position of strength over the president, and made him a leading candidate to succeed him. From unionist to boss What Ramaphosa win means for S Africa On Tuesday, the ANC told Mr Zuma to step down or face a vote of no-confidence. Then, on Wednesday, he said in a televised statement he said he was quitting with immediate effect but that he disagreed with the party's decision. ""No life should be lost in my name and also the ANC should never be divided in my name,"" he said. What next for South Africa?

"President Jacob Zuma has been dogged by corruption allegations As South African President Jacob Zuma leaves office, we look at how the controversies around him have influenced the way South Africans express themselves. Here are our top 10 phrases which have become part of the vocabulary since President Zuma became ANC leader in December 2007. The Collins dictionary defines this as ""the efforts of a small number of firms (or such actors as the military, ethnic groups, and kleptocratic politicians) to use the state to their advantage through illicit, non-transparent provision of private gains to public officials."" In South Africa, it specifically refers to the allegation that one wealthy family - the Guptas - has bought its way into the most influential organs of state, via the president and his family. For example, former Deputy Finance Minister Mcebisi Jonas said he was offered a bribe of 600m Rand ($45m; Â£34m) by one of the Gupta brothers, Ajay, in order to accept a promotion to finance minster, in exchange for removing key Treasury officials from their posts and advancing the family's ""business ambitions"". The opposition alleges that a powerful elite is enriching itself at the expense of the poor Mr Jonas also alleged that President Zuma's son Duduzane, a business partner of the Guptas, was present at the meeting. Ajay Gupta denied the meeting took place, and the family has denied all wrongdoing. President Zuma and his son have also denied all corruption allegations. The phrase was named 2017's Word of the Year by the Pan South African Language Board, a statutory body which promotes the country's official languages. ""We are happy with the choice as it echoes a year dominated by highly-charged political and social discourse,"" its chief executive Mpho Monareng said. ""I wouldn't be surprised if state capture becomes one of the defining words of our time,"" he added. Zuma: Colourful and controversial President Zuma and the Guptas believe they are the victims of a smear campaign Popularised by the opposition Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), Zupta is a blend of President Zuma's surname, and that of the Gupta brothers ( Ajay, Atul and Rajesh). The merging of the two names suggests an improperly close relationship, with their interests so intertwined that they are one, although both families deny this suggestion. How the Guptas' brand turned toxic This term is used to describe the dominant role or unfair advantage that white-owned businesses have in the South African economy, to the detriment of the black majority. More than 20 years after the end of the racist system of apartheid, white South Africans still earn around a five times more than what their black counterparts do. The redistribution of agricultural land taken from black people whilst the country was under white rule has been painfully slow. And about 95% of the country's assets are  in the hands of 10% of the population. Racial divisions run deep in South Africa But the phrase has become synonymous with murky goings on in government, after a now-notorious campaign by UK-based PR firm Bell Pottinger on behalf of the Gupta-owned firm Oakbay. The PR agency was accused of operating fake twitter accounts in a racially driven campaign against critics of the Guptas, President Zuma and his family. It was alleged to have used the term to target President Zuma's opponents, accusing them of being agents of ""White Monopoly Capital"" - in other words, representing the interests of white people. Bell Pottinger was ejected from the UK's public relations trade body when the scandal came to light, and soon afterwards went into administration as some of its top clients abandoned it. PR firm broke code in campaign When South Africans talk about ""transformation"", they mean correcting the inequalities created when the country was under white minority rule. The term ""radical"" emphasises the need to accelerate the process of putting economic power in the hands of black people, and land redistribution. Whilst it has been official ANC policy since 2012, it is alleged that Bell Pottinger deliberately pushed the term to suggest that the scandal-hit president was under attack from ""White Monopoly Capital"" because he wanted to bring about ""Radical Economic Transformation"", and Mr Zuma's critics were, in this way, painted as being less committed to tackling the past injustices against black people. The term should not to be confused with Nkandla, the president's private home which was at the centre of controversy over a multi-million dollar taxpayer-funded upgrade, including the building of a swimming pool which officials described as a ""fire pool"" in a desperate attempt to justify it as security-related expenditure. Nkaaandla, said with a nasal intonation, is a word to ridicule people who appear to be fixated about corruption allegations against President Zuma. It came into being when the president mocked the way opposition leader Mmusi Maimane pronounced the name of his rural homestead. It is now used to imply that or refer to a person who has ""sold out"". Allow YouTube content? This article contains content provided by Google YouTube.

How Zuma's Nkandla home has grown Both are terms used in parliamentary procedure. The former is used to draw attention to a rules violation, the latter to address other MPs. However, they have become synonymous with rowdy behaviour in parliament, the disruption of proceedings, and interrupting the president whilst speaking. The opposition EFF say Mr Zuma should have resigned, and have frequently interrupted parliament. It has led to fights in parliament, and EFF MPs being forcibly removed. Both terms are now used in any kind of rowdy conversation. For example, if people are having a debate over a couple of beers, you might shout ""point of order!"" until the other person shuts up. Or if your opponent makes a point that seems below the belt, you might cry ""honourable member!"" and then proceed to talk over him or her. Allow YouTube content?

The word ""nyana"" is a diminutive conjunction in the Sesotho language, meaning ""very small"". When combined with the English word ""small"" it loosely translates to ""tiny-little"" skeletons. The phrase came into use when Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini, herself the subject of much controversy, said that all of the ANC's leadership have ""smallanyana skeletons"" in their closets. She warned about ""hanging dirty linen outside"", a reference to ANC leaders who had gone to the media to air complaints. She said that if they were all to ""take out"" each others ""skeletons"" then ""all hell would break loose"". The subtext? There is no-one clean in this game, and people in glass houses shouldn't throw stones. This is a verb, meaning to change one's mind abruptly. Allow Twitter content?

It takes its name from the ANC secretary-general Gwede Mantashe, who has been accused of doing several u-turns. Following a controversial cabinet reshuffle in March, Mr Mantashe appeared to question Mr Zuma's leadership, saying the way ministers were hired and fired was ""unacceptable"". Days later he seemed to have changed his mind, saying the ANC accepted the president's reasoning. There have been many protests demanding President Zuma step down This is a phrase and Twitter hashtag meaning ""must go"" or ""must come down"".  It first came into use during the #RhodesMustFall campaign by students at the University of Cape Town to bring down a statue of colonialist Cecil Rhodes. Then there was the #FeesMustFall movement, by students campaigning for university fees to be scrapped. Later came the #ZumaMustFall and #ZuptaMustFall  movements, in response to the growing corruption allegations against the president. Now it can be used to refer to pretty much anything you do not like, for example ""this traffic must fall"" or ""homework must fall"".  It is also frequently used on social media, with #MondaysMustFall being a common hashtag. Pronounced as cha-cha-ragh, it means ""to be forward, over-eager, over-excitable, and/or annoying"". It is an old word which had something of a revival in popularity, after an encounter between then-ANC youth leader Julius Malema and BBC journalist Jonah Fisher. Mr Malema took exception to a comment from Mr Fisher at a press conference, and accused him of being tjatjarag. Mr Malema then had Mr Fisher removed. Julius Malema has turned into a fierce critic of the ANC The incident occurred in 2010, when Mr Malema was still very much a strong supporter of the president. Mr Malema was kicked out of the ANC after falling out with Mr Zuma, and is now the leader of the EFF. These days if someone was being slightly rowdy or cheeky, one might say in a tongue-in-cheek way ""don't be tjatjatrag"", or ""you are being tjatjatrag"" It also describes behaviour that is likely to get you kicked out of a room.

"Penny Lawrence says she took ""full responsibility"" for the behaviour of staff in Chad and Haiti Oxfam's deputy chief executive has resigned over the handling of a sex scandal involving aid workers. The British charity is accused of concealing the findings of an inquiry into claims staff used prostitutes while delivering aid in Haiti in 2011. Penny Lawrence said she was ""ashamed"" and takes full responsibility. The Charity Commission has launched a statutory inquiry into Oxfam - which denies a cover-up - but details of its scope have not yet been released. The watchdog says it has concerns the charity may not have ""fully and frankly"" disclosed everything it knew about the claims despite previous assurances from Oxfam. Michelle Russell, director of investigations at the commission, said if details had been known it would have dealt with the situation ""very differently"". This video can not be played Former Oxfam employee Widza Bryant: ""I was told my many locals there were... sexual relations"" It comes after an earlier meeting with the International Development Secretary in an effort to protect Oxfam's funding from being cut. Ms Lawrence joined Oxfam GB in 2006 as international programmes director, leading teams across 60 countries, according to the charity's website. Reality check: How much money goes to Oxfam? How will the Haiti scandal affect Oxfam? Oxfam boss says charity is ashamed Oxfam did not disclose 'full Haiti details' ""Concerns were raised about the behaviour of staff in Chad as well as Haiti that we failed to adequately act upon,"" she said in a statement. ""It is now clear that these allegations - involving the use of prostitutes and which related to the behaviour of both the country director and members of his team in Chad - were raised before he moved to Haiti."" By BBC diplomatic correspondent James Landale A statutory inquiry is the most serious action the Charity Commission can take. It gives the regulator new powers to investigate, demand information, suspend trustees and even freeze bank accounts. So this shows how seriously the Commission is taking the sexual misconduct claims about Oxfam staff in Haiti.  It also shows how unhappy the Commission is at not being given the full facts about what went on. International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt is being equally tough on Oxfam, threatening to withdraw funding unless it gets its house in order and shows some moral leadership. But like the Charity Commission, Ms Mordaunt is also keen to show that she is acting, by promising a new unit in her department to establish a global register of aid workers that might be able to stop predatory individuals being re-employed by charities. She knows she will face tough questioning from MPs on the international development committee next week about what her department knew and what she has done since. Reputations are on the line here and no organisation wants to be found wanting. The allegations emerged inThe Times,externalon Friday, which said Oxfam's country director for Haiti, Roland van Hauwermeiren, used prostitutes at a villa rented for him by Oxfam in the aftermath of the 2010 earthquake. According to the paper, Oxfam knew about concerns over the conduct of Mr van Hauwermeiren and another man when they worked in Chad before they were given senior roles in Haiti. Oxfam said allegations that underage girls may have been involved were unproven. BBC world affairs correspondent Will Grant said senior government sources feared the abuse allegations could be ""the tip of the iceberg"" and that all aid agencies operating in Haiti as well as Oxfam would be investigated. He added locals expressed ""real anger"" at what they say is impunity by international aid agencies for the way they have behaved. Widza Bryant, who worked in HR for Oxfam in Haiti from 2009 for three years, said she shared ""ongoing rumours"" about locals being exploited with management ""on many occasions"". She told BBC News: ""There were a lot of rumours on the ground about management and leaders exploiting the locals sexually and in other ways to get jobs and to have good standing."" This video can not be played Oxfam Chief Executive: ""We apologise to the British public and the Haitian public"" Mark Goldring, chief executive of Oxfam GB, admitted the charity had failed to act on complaints highlighting the failure to allow Mr van Hauwermeiren to move onto another post after allegations were revealed. He said the use of prostitutes was ""not explicitly contrary"" to Oxfam's code of conduct at the time, but bringing Oxfam into disrepute in any way and abusing people who may have been beneficiaries was. Mr Goldring added: ""There was an exploration of how should the organisation respond but we didn't act on it."" The European Commission has said it expects full clarity and maximum transparency from Oxfam, adding that it is ready to ""cease funding any partner not living up to high ethical standards"". The charity's programme in Haiti received â¬1.7m in EU funds in 2011. International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt said Oxfam had apologised for its ""appalling"" behaviour and that the government had not been told at the time the allegations involved sexual misconduct or beneficiaries. Oxfam has been told to tell the Department for International Development by the end of the week how it will handle any future allegations around safeguarding or it faces losing government funding. Ms Mordaunt also called for clearer whistle-blowing policies across the charitable sector and launched an urgent review into safeguarding and aid providers. The Innocent drinks company - one of Oxfam's corporate sponsors which donates around Â£100,000 per year- said it wants to see a clear plan ""for how this could not ever happen again"". The charity has since postponed a ""Fashion Fighting Poverty"" event, which had been due to take place as part of London Fashion Week on Thursday, saying it was not the ""right time"" at present. This video can not be played BBC world affairs correspondent Will Grant says locals believe aid agencies have enjoyed ""impunity"" Oxfam's own investigation in 2011 led to four people being sacked and three others resigning, including Mr van Hauwermeiren. It produced a public report, which said ""serious misconduct"" had taken place in Haiti - but did not give details of the allegations. Oxfam has faced growing criticism of the way it handled the allegations of misconduct by its staff in Haiti, where they were working in the aftermath of the huge earthquake that devastated the country in 2010. Haiti's ambassador in London Bocchit Edmond called the revelations ""shocking"", ""shameful"", and ""unacceptable"". On Sunday, Ms Mordaunt told the BBC's Andrew Marr the charity did ""absolutely the wrong thing"" by not reporting details of the allegations and that no organisation could be a government partner if it did not ""have the moral leadership to do the right thing"". Ahead of the government meeting, Oxfamannounced new measures,externalfor handling of sexual abuse cases, saying it would introduce tougher vetting of staff and mandatory safeguarding training for new recruits. Oxfam's chairman of trustees, Caroline Thomson, said the charity's board had appointed a consultant earlier this year to review its culture and working practices, which would now be extended.

She said: ""Seeing the couple is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. We don't have these visits in Mexico or my hometown of Monterey. ""They are also the hot couple of the moment because of their marriage coming up. ""I also think Meghan is a role model, she's not just a pretty face. I think she's going to change the face of the monarchy.""

"MPs are to examine the use of non-disclosure agreements as part of an inquiry into sexual harassment in the workplace. The Women and Equalities Committee said it would consider whether they were being abused by employers and legal experts to ""cover up wrongdoing"". How to protect staff and make it easier for them to report abuse are among other issues that will be looked at. Tory MP Maria Miller said changes to workplace culture were clearly needed. The inquiry follows a string of allegations of harassment and bullying against leading figures in the US film and media industries, as well as claims of inappropriate behaviour in Parliament and other high-profile British institutions. Announcing the inquiry, the committee's chair, Mrs Miller - a former Conservative cabinet minister - said women had come forward to speak about the ""appalling experiences"" that they had faced in a number of different sectors. Scandal-hit club shuts amid groping claims May calls for 'new culture of respect' The cross-party committee, she said, would look at the extent of the problem in British workplaces, who the perpetrators were, why it was continuing to happen and how it could best be tackled. The MPs will consider the scope of victims for legal redress, including employment tribunals and other forms of dispute resolution, as well as the use of non-disclosure agreements. Critics says these confidentiality agreements have been used to buy the silence of victims of harassment and assault. ""We took some evidence in January from experts in this area who told us that they felt many of these non-disclosure agreements were actually unenforceable because it isn't lawful to ask somebody to cover up criminal wrong-doing in this way,"" Mrs Miller told BBC News. ""But many of those who are forced to sign non-disclosure agreements really have very little knowledge of the law and wouldn't be aware that they're being asked to do something which is unlawful in itself."" The cross-party committee is already looking at women's experiences of everyday sexism in public places. Under proposals published last week, MPs found to have bullied or harassed their staff will have to write a letter of apology and undergo training while, in more serious cases, they could be suspended or forced to face a public vote on their future. The committee also called for a new code of behaviour, independent of the political parties, applying to everyone on the Parliamentary estate, including visitors.

"Theresa May said she had ""full and frank conversations with the main parties"" Prime Minister Theresa May has urged Northern Ireland's parties to make one final push towards an agreement to restore devolved government. Irish prime minister Leo Varadkar said he was hopeful that a deal would be struck this week. They were speaking after a series of meetings with the parties in Northern Ireland. The DUP and Sinn FÃ©in have said that a deal is possible following Monday's talks. DUP leader Arlene Foster says there ""isn't a deal yet"" Speaking afterwards, DUP leader Arlene Foster said: ""There isn't a deal yet, what there is, is very good progress."" Sinn FÃ©in President Mary Lou McDonald said the talks had reached ""a decisive phase"". Stormont deadlock: Need-to-know guide Tory-DUP deal: What you need to know Profile: Sinn FÃ©in's new leader Mary Lou McDonald Mrs May said that ""it was now at the point where it's time for local elected representatives to find a way to work together"". She said she had ""full and frank conversations with the main parties"" and that while ""some differences remain, I believe it is possible to see the basis of an agreement here"". Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Leo Varadkar said he was hopeful that the two parties could ""come to an agreement this week"". Asked why the DUP did not meet the Irish government at Stormont today a party source told the BBC they were focussing on internal Northern Ireland matters. The source added there were also logistical difficulties. Leo Varadkar said he believes a deal could be struck within days ""The soundings from Arlene Foster and Mary Lou McDonald were positive,"" he added. Northern Ireland has been run by civil servants since the power-sharing executive made up of the DUP and Sinn FÃ©incollapsed in January last year. The then deputy first minister, Martin McGuinness, pulled Sinn FÃ©in out of the coalition after a series of disagreements with the final straw being the DUP's handling ofa scandal over green energy scheme. Sinn FÃ©in President Mary Lou McDonald (left) says the talks have reached ""a decisive phase"" Mrs Foster said her party wanted a deal that was ""sustainable into the future"". Ms McDonald said:  ""What is required now is the political will to make it happen."" SDLP leader Colum Eastwood called on the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in to ""stop messing about"". Leo Varadkar tweeted a photo of the intergovernmental talks at Stormont ""We still don't know the colour of this deal,"" he said. Prior to arriving at Stormont, Mrs May visited Bombardier's plant in Belfast. Theresa May toured the Bombardier aerospace plant in east Belfast She met factory floor workers and was shown the capabilities of the multi-million pound plant which is the main production site for wings for the C-Series. Her visit came just over two weeks afterBombardier's victory in a trade dispute with rival aerospace firm Boeing. The US International Trade Commission (ITC) overturned a decision to impose damaging tariffs on US imports of its C-Series aircraft, which would have placed jobs in the Belfast factory at risk. Mrs May met Bombardier staff and management Several previous rounds of talks between the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in have, so far, failed to break the political deadlock. Earlier, a DUP source told the BBC a deal ""is not likely"" on Monday. Mrs May last visited Northern Ireland in May when she toured the Balmoral Show ahead of a snap general election. Since then, she has struck a parliamentary deal with the DUP and has faced criticism for adopting a hands-off approach to the deadlock at Stormont. Among the issues that have divided the parties is Sinn FÃ©in's demand for an Irish language act. The talks are taking place in Stormont House By BBC News NI political correspondent Mark Devenport The Irish language act has been a major stumbling block, with DUP leader Arlene Foster promising previously that it wouldn't happen on her watch. What I am led to believe is that there could possibly be a very strange, legislative fudge which would see the creation of three separate bills, one for the Irish language, one dealing with Ulster Scots and one for wider cultural issues. The suggestion is that these three bills would end up merging together as one act in an attempt to spare blushes on all sides. On marriage equality, I am not exactly sure how they are going to sort that one out, but one option that has been discussed is the possibility of bringing a private member's bill on the issue or deferring responsibility to Westminster. At least three or four DUP MLAs would be pretty hostile to the notion, but equally there are some who would support it, or at least not object A Downing Street spokesman said the prime minister would remind the parties of the many pressing issues facing Northern Ireland and make clear her belief that a fully functioning executive is the best way to serve the interests of the whole community. Secretary of State Karen Bradley welcomed Mrs May to Stormont House ""The (Irish) government has consistently said that the restoration of the institutions is essential in the context of full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, and that it will continue to work very closely with the British government to support the northern parties to achieve this outcome,"" he said. At the weekend, Sinn FÃ©in's vice president Michelle O'Neill predicted that the Stormont talks would conclude this week. Her comment strengthened speculation that a compromise between her party and the DUP could soon be unveiled.

"The Commonwealth has secretly begun considering who might succeed the Queen as its head, the BBC has learned. The issue is hugely sensitive because the role is not hereditary and will not pass automatically to the Prince of Wales on the Queen's death. The Commonwealth has set up a ""high level group"" to look at the way the international organisation is governed. This group is meeting later, officially to review how the Commonwealth is run by its secretariat and governors. It said the issue of the succession of the head of the Commonwealth was not part of the group's mandate, but described the day-long discussions as ""open"". However, senior sources added that the gathering in London would also consider what happens when the Queen, who turns 92 in April, dies. What is the Commonwealth of Nations? How relevant is the Commonwealth today? Royal Family present list for 2017 revealed One said: ""I imagine the question of the succession, however distasteful it may naturally be, will come up."" The agenda for the summit, seen by the BBC, says there will be a discussion of ""wider governance considerations"" which insiders say is code for the succession. The group is expected to report to the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) in London in April, which is likely to be the last that the 91-year-old monarch will attend. The group said it was independent of the London-based Commonwealth Secretariat, and would report only to the heads of Commonwealth governments. The Queen congratulating winners of the Commonwealth Youth Awards in 2016 A second source said the issue of the succession is expected to be discussed by Commonwealth leaders on the margins of the summit, particularly when they meet without officials ""on retreat"" at Windsor Castle. The Queen was proclaimed Head of the Commonwealth at her coronation in 1953, when she was head of state in seven of its eight members. Although the Queen took over from her father George VI, it is not an hereditary position that will pass automatically to her son - who will be head of state in only 15 of the 53 member nations that now make up the Commonwealth. It is a loose association of former British colonies, plus some other nations It was founded in 1931 There are 53 member countries Its secretariat (headquarters) is based in London About 2.4bn people live in Commonwealth countries Any decision about the future would have to be made by the Commonwealth heads of government at the time of the Queen's death. But there is no formal process for choosing her successor. While many Commonwealth figures presume there will be no realistic alternative to Prince Charles, there has in the past been talk of electing a ceremonial leader to improve the organisation's democratic credentials. Prince Charles is considered the obvious successor to the Queen as head of the Commonwealth One source said the issue to be decided was whether a one-off decision should be taken to appoint Prince Charles to the position, or whether a new process should be agreed to ensure that it is always the British monarch who automatically becomes head of the Commonwealth. ""There are various formulas being played with,"" the source said. ""Should it always be the heir to the throne or Prince Charles himself? Is it the person or the position?"" The high level group, which is made up of seven senior former ministers from the Commonwealth, will meet at the body's London headquarters at Marlborough House. The group, which has its own staff and budget, is independent of the Commonwealth Secretariat. It will look at how the secretariat is run and funded, how a new secretary general is chosen and the balance of power between the Commonwealth's governors and executive committee. According to documents seen by the BBC, the high level group will not just confine itself to bureaucratic changes. The agenda for the meeting says: ""Discussions will take into consideration the issues raised in the first session and also the wider governance considerations of the Commonwealth."" The Queen has been the head of the Commonwealth since her coronation in 1953. In that time she has travelled across the constituent countries, including Australia in 1977, above The Queen has been working in private to try to ensure that Prince Charles does succeed her, sending senior officials around the world to lobby Commonwealth leaders. At the last CHOGM in Malta in 2015, the Queen told them that she could not ""wish to have been better supported and represented in the Commonwealth than by the Prince of Wales who continues to give so much to it with great distinction"". The Prince of Wales represented the Queen at the CHOGM in Sri Lanka in 2013. A whole section of his website is devoted to the Commonwealth, noting that he has visited 41 out of 53 countries and has been a ""proud supporter"" for more than four decades. The high level group consists of: Chairman Anote Tong: Former president of Kiribati Lord Howell: Former British energy secretary Louise Frechette: Former United Nations deputy secretary general Robert Hill: Former Australian defence minister Dame Billie Miller: Former deputy prime minister of Barbados Dr Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala: Former Nigerian minister of finance George Vella: Former deputy prime minister of Malta Queen to cut plastic use on royal estates Queen visits local WI despite power cut Coronation details revealed in documentary Bird flu confirmed in Queen's swans Firefighters running out of water as wildfire declared most destructive in LA's history In maps: Thousands of acres on fire in LA 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Why does Trump want Greenland and what do its people think?

"This handout photo by KCNA shows Kim Jong-un, who appears to be supported by Ms Kim Yo-jong on his left and Mr Kim Yong-nam on his right North Korea's leader has called for a ""further livening up"" of the ""warm climate of reconciliation"" with the South created by the Winter Olympics. Kim Jong-un, whose nuclear bomb and missile tests have stoked international tension, praised the South for hosting his state at the games in Pyeongchang. Kim's apparent Games charm offensive was led by his sister Kim Yo-jong. South Korean President President Moon Jae-in has meanwhile said the US is open to talking with the North. He did not elaborate and may have been referring to a remark by US Vice-President Mike Pence on his flight back to Washington from the Games. ""If you want to talk, we'll talk,"" Mr Pence was quoted as saying by the Washington Post.,external While the North's attendance at the Games has been seen as marking a major warming in relations, there have also been concerns that it has allowed it to win a propaganda victory. What a 'casual' photo tells us about N Korea Kim's sister and North Korea's secret weapon North Korean cheerleaders mesmerise crowds He thanked the South for ""specially prioritising"" the North's attendance at the Games, North Korean state news agency KCNA reports. Ms Kim's visit has been one of the most talked-about aspects of the Games He also gave ""important instructions"" on how to ""liven up"" the ""warm climate of reconciliation and dialogue"". A picture released by the agency shows Mr Kim flanked by his sister and the North's ceremonial head of state, Kim Yong-nam, both linking arms with him. Ms Kim and Mr Kim Yong-nam made up the most senior delegation from the North to visit the South since the Korean War in the 1950s. The two states have never signed a peace treaty and are in a constant state of mutual distrust. On Saturday, Ms Kim handed over a letter from her brother to President Moon, inviting him to visit Pyongyang. If the summit goes ahead, it will be the first meeting in more than a decade between Korean leaders. North Korea got what it wanted from the Winter Olympics A history of North Korea at the Olympics Winter Olympics: The political background explained Ms Kim's appearance at the Games has been widely criticised, as she is on a US sanctions list over alleged links to human rights abuses in North Korea. She headed the North's delegation and has now returned home. By Laura Bicker, BBC News, Pyeongchang, South Korea You could almost feel the ripple of excitement as Kim Yo-jong walked into the opening ceremony of the Winter Olympic Games. Necks craned and mobile phones were held aloft to catch a glimpse. I found myself, along with others, leaning as far as I could over the balcony to try to see her in the VIP box below.

Read more from Laura Bicker here Her country is subject to a raft of sanctions from the US, the UN and the EU over its weapons programmes and Japan has said it remains sceptical about the ""charm offensive"". ""I am aware that some people argue that because North Korea is engaging in dialogue we should reward them,"" Foreign Minister Taro Kono said before the Games. ""Frankly I think this view is too naive. I believe that North Korea wants to buy some time to continue their nuclear missile programme."" Mr Pence stressed the US would continue imposing sanctions and putting pressure on Pyongyang. North Korea's presence at the Games raised concerns about a propaganda victory ""The point is, no pressure comes off until they are actually doing something that the alliance believes represents a meaningful step toward denuclearization,"" Mr Pence told the Post.

"This video can not be played WATCH: The BBC's Chris Foxx learns about the tool The UK government has unveiled a tool it says can accurately detect jihadist content and block it from being viewed. Home Secretary Amber Rudd told the BBC she would not rule out forcing technology companies to use it by law. Ms Rudd is visiting the US to meet tech companies to discuss the idea, as well as other efforts to tackle extremism. Thousands of hours of content posted by the Islamic State group was run past  the tool, in order to ""train"" it to automatically spot extremist material. This video can not be played WATCH: Home Secretary Amber Rudd on new terror tool The government provided Â£600,000 of public funds towards the creation of the tool by an artificial intelligence company based in London. ASI Data Science said the software can be configured to detect 94% of IS video uploads. Anything the software identifies as potential IS material would be flagged up for a human decision to be taken. The company said it typically flagged 0.005% of non-IS video uploads. On a site with five million daily uploads, it would flag 250 non-IS videos for review. It is intended to lighten the moderation burden faced by small companies that may not have the resources to effectively tackle extremist material being posted on their sites. Similar tools in the past have been heavily criticised by advocates of an ""open"" internet, saying such efforts can produce false positives - and that means content that is not particularly problematic ends up being taken down or blocked. In London, reporters were given an off-the-record briefing detailing how ASI's software worked, but were asked not to share its precise methodology. However, in simple terms, it is an algorithm that draws on characteristics typical of IS and its online activity. PM seeks 'safe and ethical' artificial intelligence How terror groups hijacked social media Facebook's AI wipes terrorism-related posts Islamic State piggybacks Baaz's social mega-feed In Silicon Valley, the home secretary told the BBC the tool was made as a way to demonstrate that the government's demand for a clampdown on extremist activity was not unreasonable. ""It's a very convincing example of the fact that you can have the information you need to make sure this material doesn't go online in the first place,"" she said. ""The technology is there. There are tools out there that can do exactly what we're asking for. For smaller companies, this could be ideal."" Silicon Valley giants such as Facebook and Google are pouring their own resources into solving this problem, but this tool is at first intended to be used by small companies, and they may one day be forced to use it. ""We're not going to rule out taking legislative action if we need to do it,"" the home secretary said. ""But I remain convinced that the best way to take real action, to have the best outcomes, is to have an industry-led forum like the one we've got."" The Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism, launched last year, brings together several governments including the US and UK, and major internet firms like Facebook, Google, Twitter and others. However, the bigger challenge is predicting which parts of the internet that jihadis will use next. The Home Office estimates that between July and the end of 2017, extremist material appeared in almost 150 web services that had not been used for such propaganda before.

"Men, women, children, even babies - were shot or hacked to death inside the church The Monrovia Church massacre in 1990 was the worst single atrocity of the Liberian civil war. About 600 civilians, including many children, were killed while taking refuge in a church. Now, four survivors are bringing a claim for damages against one of the men they believe was responsible, reports Elizabeth Blunt who was a BBC correspondent in Liberia at the time. It was July 1990, and rebel fighters were advancing on the capital, Monrovia. President Samuel Doe was holed up in his vast, gloomy Executive Mansion. After dark bands of soldiers roamed the streets, looting shops and warehouses and seeking out people from Nimba County, the area where the rebellion had started. They dragged the men from their homes, beating and often killing them. Hundreds of terrified families, looking for a safer place to sleep, took refuge in St Peter's Lutheran Church - a spacious building in a walled compound. Huge Red Cross flags flew at every corner. Bullet holes on church windows But on the night of 29 July, government soldiers came over the wall and started killing those inside. An estimated 600 people - men, women, children, even babies - were shot or hacked to death with machetes before the order was given to stop. A Guinean woman doctor, who was one of the first to reach the church the next day, described to me the scene of utter horror. Dead bodies were everywhere. The only sign of life was a baby crying. She describes having to walk over corpses to reach the child, but when she picked it up and tried to comfort it, she said she suddenly saw a flicker of movement, and then another. A few children had survived, protected by the bodies of their parents, but only when they saw her, a civilian and a woman taking care of the baby, did they dare to come out. One of the child survivors is among those now suing for damages. American missionary Bette McCrandall was there, too, that morning - she had lain awake the previous night, listening to everything that was happening from the Lutheran bishop's compound close by. She says those events have stayed with her, even all these years afterwards, as they have with all the survivors. ""The memories of that day and that night don't leave me,"" she says. St Peter's Lutheran Church has now been rebuilt This was the worst atrocity of the war, the event so shocking that it drove neighbouring countries to mount an armed intervention. Yet no-one has ever been prosecuted or held responsible. The man now being taken to court in the US is Moses Thomas, formerly a colonel in the much-feared Special Anti-Terrorist Unit (Satu), based at the Executive Mansion. Survivors have identified him as one of those giving orders that night. Now he lives in the US state of Pennsylvania. Like many Liberians, he was given what is known as ""temporary protected status"", because of the atrocities which were going on back home. Liberia has had a Truth and Reconciliation Commission, and Mr Thomas was among those recommended for prosecution - but no cases have ever been brought. So now a movement has started to bring them to justice outside Liberia. Speaking to the BBC after being served court papers on Monday, Mr Thomas called the allegation ""nonsense"". ""I don't want to give any credence to the allegation,"" he said. ""No-one in my unit had anything to do with the attack on the church."" Hassan Bility, who heads the Global Justice and Research Project in Monrovia, said he was pleased with the latest development. ""For 27 years the survivors of this massacre have fought and laboured for justice without success, and nobody has been paying any attention - not the Liberian government, not anybody outside. So this is a small victory,"" he says. 1989:Charles Taylor starts rebellion against President Samuel Doe 1990:Doe horrifically killed by rebels 1997:Civil war ends after death of some 250,000 people. Taylor elected president 2012:Taylor convicted of war crimes in neighbouring Sierra Leone Liberia's key dates Is ex-warlord pulling election strings from UK prison? Ex-footballer George Weah faces his toughest challenge Ms McCrandall certainly sees it as important. ""For me,"" she says, ""it is a chance for him to own up to what he has done, and on whose orders. ""That person will have to live and die with the guilt of what he has done. And in my mind it is comforting to me that this issue has not been put to rest, that the case has not been dropped."" The snag is that for the moment this is only a civil suit, not a criminal case. A number of criminal prosecutions have started in Europe, where courts will hear cases for war crimes under so-called ""universal jurisdiction"". In the US that is more difficult, so campaigners against impunity have had to be ingenious.One Liberian warlord, known as ""Jungle Jabbah"", was recently prosecuted for immigration fraud,external, since he had falsely claimed on his application that he had never belonged to any armed group. Mr Thomas is being sued in a civil action by four of the survivors. If they win, he is unlikely to be able to afford much in damages. But campaigners hope that the evidence which comes out in court will make the American authorities question his ""protected"" status, opening the way for a criminal prosecution or deportation. But if he is deported back to Liberia, what then? Would he go on trial? Liberia never set up a special court and has never tried any war crimes cases. Many suspects still hold high positions. Campaigner Hassan Bility clings to the hope that now, with a new government now in place, things might be different. Current president George Weah was not involved in the conflict because he was playing football in Europe ""The current President, George Weah, was totally disconnected from the war,"" he says. ""He was not part of any faction; he was playing football in Europe... And he gets a lot of his support from poor people, the ones who really suffered in the war... We have the opportunity right now to do this"". Ex-footballer George Weah faces his toughest challenge Did Liberia's first female leader make a difference?

"BiFab was saved from administration following Scottish government intervention last year Union representatives have said the BiFab marine engineering yards in Fife and on Lewis could close by the end of June. They have been told by managers at the yards that redundancy notices will be given to the core workforce on Tuesday. The Unite union said it expects about 260 jobs to go, with redundancies beginning in May. The Scottish government has said it will offer practical support to those who lose their jobs. The union said it has been told the decision will only be reversed if new contracts for work are signed. Unite regional officer Bob McGregor said: ""So much has been done to save these yards until now. ""The workers there have fought for their future and it is difficult to believe that it can now be snatched away from them. ""The closures of these yards will turn these areas into an industrial graveyard. The prospect fills us with dismay."" BiFab, which operates the yards at Burntisland and Arnish, reached an agreement with business partners in November to receive payments to alleviate its ""immediate cash flow issues"". Scotland's economy secretary, Keith Brown, said at the time that if the offer of a Â£15m loan from the Scottish government was required, it would be extended to the firm on commercial terms. Last month, it emerged BiFab was facing legal action from one of its business partners, German firm EEW. Both companies have been working on contracts for the Â£2.6bn Beatrice Offshore Windfarm in the Outer Moray Firth. Nicola Sturgeon said in November that there was ""every reason to be optimistic"" about BiFab's future Mr McGregor added: ""We can't say this is a total shock because work at the yard has been running down for weeks now. ""However all the interested parties, the company, the contractors, the unions and the Scottish government, given what has been done so far, must surely look to have an eleventh hour intervention which can do something to save these jobs."" The Scottish government has committed to supporting efforts to secure the future of the company, while offering support to those made redundant. Economy secretary Keith Brown said: ""This will be hugely concerning for the workers affected and their families - and we stand ready to provide support through our Partnership Action for Continuing Employment (PACE) initiative. ""By providing skills development and employability support, PACE aims to minimise the time individuals affected by redundancy are out of work. He added: ""Ministers recognise that more work remains to be done to secure the long term future of the company and are fully committed to offering support where possible to attract long term investment in this vital sector of the Scottish supply chain and economy."" In November, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon met workers at BiFab where she promised that the Scottish government would play its ""full part in trying to secure the longer term future of this company"". She said at the time: ""There is every reason to be optimistic, but that doesn't mean there is not a lot of work that needs to be done including investment that needs to be done to secure it.""

"This handout photo by KCNA shows Kim Jong-un, who appears to be supported by Ms Kim Yo-jong on his left and Mr Kim Yong-nam on his right North Korea's leader has called for a ""further livening up"" of the ""warm climate of reconciliation"" with the South created by the Winter Olympics. Kim Jong-un, whose nuclear bomb and missile tests have stoked international tension, praised the South for hosting his state at the games in Pyeongchang. Kim's apparent Games charm offensive was led by his sister Kim Yo-jong. South Korean President President Moon Jae-in has meanwhile said the US is open to talking with the North. He did not elaborate and may have been referring to a remark by US Vice-President Mike Pence on his flight back to Washington from the Games. ""If you want to talk, we'll talk,"" Mr Pence was quoted as saying by the Washington Post.,external While the North's attendance at the Games has been seen as marking a major warming in relations, there have also been concerns that it has allowed it to win a propaganda victory. What a 'casual' photo tells us about N Korea Kim's sister and North Korea's secret weapon North Korean cheerleaders mesmerise crowds He thanked the South for ""specially prioritising"" the North's attendance at the Games, North Korean state news agency KCNA reports. Ms Kim's visit has been one of the most talked-about aspects of the Games He also gave ""important instructions"" on how to ""liven up"" the ""warm climate of reconciliation and dialogue"". A picture released by the agency shows Mr Kim flanked by his sister and the North's ceremonial head of state, Kim Yong-nam, both linking arms with him. Ms Kim and Mr Kim Yong-nam made up the most senior delegation from the North to visit the South since the Korean War in the 1950s. The two states have never signed a peace treaty and are in a constant state of mutual distrust. On Saturday, Ms Kim handed over a letter from her brother to President Moon, inviting him to visit Pyongyang. If the summit goes ahead, it will be the first meeting in more than a decade between Korean leaders. North Korea got what it wanted from the Winter Olympics A history of North Korea at the Olympics Winter Olympics: The political background explained Ms Kim's appearance at the Games has been widely criticised, as she is on a US sanctions list over alleged links to human rights abuses in North Korea. She headed the North's delegation and has now returned home. By Laura Bicker, BBC News, Pyeongchang, South Korea You could almost feel the ripple of excitement as Kim Yo-jong walked into the opening ceremony of the Winter Olympic Games. Necks craned and mobile phones were held aloft to catch a glimpse. I found myself, along with others, leaning as far as I could over the balcony to try to see her in the VIP box below.

Read more from Laura Bicker here Her country is subject to a raft of sanctions from the US, the UN and the EU over its weapons programmes and Japan has said it remains sceptical about the ""charm offensive"". ""I am aware that some people argue that because North Korea is engaging in dialogue we should reward them,"" Foreign Minister Taro Kono said before the Games. ""Frankly I think this view is too naive. I believe that North Korea wants to buy some time to continue their nuclear missile programme."" Mr Pence stressed the US would continue imposing sanctions and putting pressure on Pyongyang. North Korea's presence at the Games raised concerns about a propaganda victory ""The point is, no pressure comes off until they are actually doing something that the alliance believes represents a meaningful step toward denuclearization,"" Mr Pence told the Post.

"Penny Lawrence says she took ""full responsibility"" for the behaviour of staff in Chad and Haiti Oxfam's deputy chief executive has resigned over the handling of a sex scandal involving aid workers. The British charity is accused of concealing the findings of an inquiry into claims staff used prostitutes while delivering aid in Haiti in 2011. Penny Lawrence said she was ""ashamed"" and takes full responsibility. The Charity Commission has launched a statutory inquiry into Oxfam - which denies a cover-up - but details of its scope have not yet been released. The watchdog says it has concerns the charity may not have ""fully and frankly"" disclosed everything it knew about the claims despite previous assurances from Oxfam. Michelle Russell, director of investigations at the commission, said if details had been known it would have dealt with the situation ""very differently"". This video can not be played Former Oxfam employee Widza Bryant: ""I was told my many locals there were... sexual relations"" It comes after an earlier meeting with the International Development Secretary in an effort to protect Oxfam's funding from being cut. Ms Lawrence joined Oxfam GB in 2006 as international programmes director, leading teams across 60 countries, according to the charity's website. Reality check: How much money goes to Oxfam? How will the Haiti scandal affect Oxfam? Oxfam boss says charity is ashamed Oxfam did not disclose 'full Haiti details' ""Concerns were raised about the behaviour of staff in Chad as well as Haiti that we failed to adequately act upon,"" she said in a statement. ""It is now clear that these allegations - involving the use of prostitutes and which related to the behaviour of both the country director and members of his team in Chad - were raised before he moved to Haiti."" By BBC diplomatic correspondent James Landale A statutory inquiry is the most serious action the Charity Commission can take. It gives the regulator new powers to investigate, demand information, suspend trustees and even freeze bank accounts. So this shows how seriously the Commission is taking the sexual misconduct claims about Oxfam staff in Haiti.  It also shows how unhappy the Commission is at not being given the full facts about what went on. International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt is being equally tough on Oxfam, threatening to withdraw funding unless it gets its house in order and shows some moral leadership. But like the Charity Commission, Ms Mordaunt is also keen to show that she is acting, by promising a new unit in her department to establish a global register of aid workers that might be able to stop predatory individuals being re-employed by charities. She knows she will face tough questioning from MPs on the international development committee next week about what her department knew and what she has done since. Reputations are on the line here and no organisation wants to be found wanting. The allegations emerged inThe Times,externalon Friday, which said Oxfam's country director for Haiti, Roland van Hauwermeiren, used prostitutes at a villa rented for him by Oxfam in the aftermath of the 2010 earthquake. According to the paper, Oxfam knew about concerns over the conduct of Mr van Hauwermeiren and another man when they worked in Chad before they were given senior roles in Haiti. Oxfam said allegations that underage girls may have been involved were unproven. BBC world affairs correspondent Will Grant said senior government sources feared the abuse allegations could be ""the tip of the iceberg"" and that all aid agencies operating in Haiti as well as Oxfam would be investigated. He added locals expressed ""real anger"" at what they say is impunity by international aid agencies for the way they have behaved. Widza Bryant, who worked in HR for Oxfam in Haiti from 2009 for three years, said she shared ""ongoing rumours"" about locals being exploited with management ""on many occasions"". She told BBC News: ""There were a lot of rumours on the ground about management and leaders exploiting the locals sexually and in other ways to get jobs and to have good standing."" This video can not be played Oxfam Chief Executive: ""We apologise to the British public and the Haitian public"" Mark Goldring, chief executive of Oxfam GB, admitted the charity had failed to act on complaints highlighting the failure to allow Mr van Hauwermeiren to move onto another post after allegations were revealed. He said the use of prostitutes was ""not explicitly contrary"" to Oxfam's code of conduct at the time, but bringing Oxfam into disrepute in any way and abusing people who may have been beneficiaries was. Mr Goldring added: ""There was an exploration of how should the organisation respond but we didn't act on it."" The European Commission has said it expects full clarity and maximum transparency from Oxfam, adding that it is ready to ""cease funding any partner not living up to high ethical standards"". The charity's programme in Haiti received â¬1.7m in EU funds in 2011. International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt said Oxfam had apologised for its ""appalling"" behaviour and that the government had not been told at the time the allegations involved sexual misconduct or beneficiaries. Oxfam has been told to tell the Department for International Development by the end of the week how it will handle any future allegations around safeguarding or it faces losing government funding. Ms Mordaunt also called for clearer whistle-blowing policies across the charitable sector and launched an urgent review into safeguarding and aid providers. The Innocent drinks company - one of Oxfam's corporate sponsors which donates around Â£100,000 per year- said it wants to see a clear plan ""for how this could not ever happen again"". The charity has since postponed a ""Fashion Fighting Poverty"" event, which had been due to take place as part of London Fashion Week on Thursday, saying it was not the ""right time"" at present. This video can not be played BBC world affairs correspondent Will Grant says locals believe aid agencies have enjoyed ""impunity"" Oxfam's own investigation in 2011 led to four people being sacked and three others resigning, including Mr van Hauwermeiren. It produced a public report, which said ""serious misconduct"" had taken place in Haiti - but did not give details of the allegations. Oxfam has faced growing criticism of the way it handled the allegations of misconduct by its staff in Haiti, where they were working in the aftermath of the huge earthquake that devastated the country in 2010. Haiti's ambassador in London Bocchit Edmond called the revelations ""shocking"", ""shameful"", and ""unacceptable"". On Sunday, Ms Mordaunt told the BBC's Andrew Marr the charity did ""absolutely the wrong thing"" by not reporting details of the allegations and that no organisation could be a government partner if it did not ""have the moral leadership to do the right thing"". Ahead of the government meeting, Oxfamannounced new measures,externalfor handling of sexual abuse cases, saying it would introduce tougher vetting of staff and mandatory safeguarding training for new recruits. Oxfam's chairman of trustees, Caroline Thomson, said the charity's board had appointed a consultant earlier this year to review its culture and working practices, which would now be extended.

"Many in the ANC hope that removing Mr Zuma will boost the party's chances in the 2019 elections Leaders of South Africa's ruling ANC party are meeting to decide the future of President Jacob Zuma, who is under intense pressure to quit. Reports quoting party insiders say the National Executive Committee (NEC) has given him two days to step down. ANC leader Cyril Ramaphosa was seen leaving the Pretoria talks, reportedly for Mr Zuma's nearby residence, before returning to the venue late on Monday. Mr Zuma, 75, has been battling corruption allegations. He has resisted increasing pressure to quit since December, when Mr Ramaphosa replaced him as leader of the ANC. Speaking to supporters in Cape Town on Sunday, Mr Ramaphosa said: ""We know you want closure. Our people want this matter to be finalised."" He acknowledged the ANC was going through ""a period of difficulty, disunity and discord"", and said he was seeking ""a new beginning"". He pledged to tackle the corruption that has marred Mr Zuma's nine years in office. Mr Ramaphosa urged South Africans to restore the values embodied by Nelson Mandela - the country's first black president, also known as Madiba - and said those who had stolen state assets would be brought to justice. ""We must work together as Madiba taught us to push back the frontiers of poverty, unemployment and inequality,"" he said. An NEC meeting was called off last week following direct talks between Mr Zuma and Mr Ramaphosa, who is the deputy president as well as the new leader of the party. Mr Zuma's presidency has been overshadowed by allegations of corruption. This video can not be played The Zuma presidency: Scandals and successes In recent years his links to the wealthy India-born Gupta family, who are alleged to have influenced the government, have caused his popularity to plummet. Both Mr Zuma and the Guptas deny the allegations. Six reasons why Zuma is under pressure The many trials of Jacob Zuma By Lebo Diseko, BBC News, Johannesburg It is worth noting that Mr Zuma has not actually been found guilty of any of the accusations against him. The allegations that there is a corrupt relationship between Mr Zuma and the Gupta family are just that, allegations. And 18 corruption charges, stemming from a 1990s arms deal, were dropped before he became president and have not been reinstated. On top of this, Mr Zuma is still very popular, particularly in rural areas and his home region of KwaZulu-Natal. Mr Ramaphosa may want to make sure Mr Zuma's supporters do not feel he has been treated badly - especially as an election is coming up next year. Correspondents say that if the NEC agreed to recall Mr Zuma, it would be very difficult for him to resist. But he is not legally obliged to step down if they ask him to. If he so wishes, Mr Zuma could carry on as president of South Africa even if the NEC asked him to step down. However, he would then be expected to face a confidence vote in parliament. The date for this has already been set - 22 February. Mr Zuma has survived other such votes, but he would not be expected to pull it off again. A confidence vote would be considered a humiliating process for him and the party. South African media is calling President Zuma's seemingly inevitable exit ""Zexit"". South Africa's previous president, Thabo Mbeki, resigned in 2008. He also had a power struggle with his deputy. The deputy in question was Jacob Zuma, who took over the presidency the following year.
