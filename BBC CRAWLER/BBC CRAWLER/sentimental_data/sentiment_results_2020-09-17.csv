"New restrictions aimed at halting the rise in coronavirus cases in north-east England have come into force, affecting almost two million people. The temporary measures, which started at midnight, are to tackle ""concerning rates of infection"" in the region. The rules affect Newcastle, Gateshead, Sunderland, Northumberland, South Tyneside, North Tyneside and the County Durham council area. Pubs and restaurants must shut early and household-mixing has been limited. Responding to the rise in infections, Newcastle City Council leader Nick Forbes said: ""The evidence we've found from local testing is that it's spreading in three main areas - in pubs, in people's homes and in grassroots sports."" Meanwhile,new rules banning separate households from meeting each other at home or in private gardenshave been introduced in Lancashire, Merseyside, parts of the Midlands and West Yorkshire. The measures, due to take effect from Tuesday, will also mean shorter opening hours for pubs and restaurants in parts of Lancashire and Merseyside. Northumberland, Newcastle, Sunderland, North and South Tyneside, Gateshead and County Durham council areas are affected The new measures for north-east England include: Meeting people outside your household or support bubble in private homes and gardens is banned (exemptions include attending a birth, visiting someone who is dying, work, education, registered childcare, emergencies or care issues, moving house and child contact arrangements) People are advised not to socialise outside their household in public venues Residents should only use public transport for essential purposes, such as going to school or work Pubs, restaurants, cafes must be table service only and all leisure venues must shut at 22:00 Holidays are permitted but only with members of your household or support bubble Travel outside the area is permitted but visiting another home or garden is not People are advised not to attend amateur or professional sporting events as a spectator Schools, colleges and universities remain open Care homes are closed to non-essential visitors except in end-of-life circumstances There are no local changes to funerals, weddings or religious ceremonies It had been hoped that grandparents helping with childcare would be excluded from the restrictions - but they are not. Mr Forbes tweeted that Newcastle City Council had ""specifically"" asked for this to be allowed. Northumbria Police said it would provide a ""proportionate response"" to reports the rules being broken, and would assess the situation to determine the most appropriate course of action. A spokesman said: ""We will look to engage with people in the first instance, explaining the restrictions and encouraging them to follow the regulations. ""However, where necessary, we will take enforcement action.""

Speaking in the House of Commons on Thursday, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: ""The data says that we must act now.""

"Pubs and restaurants could be shut for a few weeks as part of stricter measures across England to slow the surge of coronavirus cases. The government is considering a short period of tighter rules which could be announced in the next week, BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said. Schools and most workplaces would be kept open during those weeks. Health Secretary Matt Hancock told the BBC the government is ""prepared to do what it takes"" against Covid-19. It comes as the UK recorded a further 4,322 confirmed cases of coronavirus - the first time the daily total of positive tests has exceeded 4,000 since 8 May. Another 27 deaths were reported within 28 days of a positive test. UK coronavirus cases up by 3,395 on Thursday Which areas are under lockdown? Described by the government as a ""circuit-break"", the measures being considered could involve re-introducing restrictions in public spaces for a period of a few weeks. Schools and workplaces would stay open. Ideas suggested by the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) include closing some parts of the hospitality sector. No 10 is also considering limiting the opening hours of pubs and restaurants across the country, as has already happened in some areas. Mr Hancock said there had been an ""acceleration"" in cases in the last couple of weeks, with the number of people admitted to hospital doubling about every eight days. He stressed it was ""critical"" that people followed social distancing guidelines and local lockdown rules, where they applied, to ""avoid having to take serious further measures"". The Office for National Statistics' weekly infections survey for England and Wales, used by the government to base its decisions, estimates there wereabout 6,000 new cases a day in Englandin the week to 10 September. Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has saidthe next few days will be ""critical"" to avoid another full-scale lockdownin Scotland. Ms Sturgeon, Welsh First Minister, Mark Drakeford, and Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer have all asked Boris Johnson for an emergency Cobra meeting to be called. At a meeting on Wednesday night, the UK government's chief scientific adviser and medical adviser said they were forecasting a significant number of deaths by the end of October if there were no further interventions. Basic maths shows us how quickly coronavirus cases can, theoretically, soar. Around 4,000 infections a day, doubling every eight days, would be 128,000 new daily cases by the end of October. That is not guaranteed to happen, and a change in our behaviour, the ""rule of six"" or restrictions like those in north-east England could improve the situation. The point of a national ""circuit-break"" would be to achieve a controlled drop in the levels of coronavirus without needing a full lockdown. This does two things, obviously it helps avoid having very high levels of the virus that could overwhelm hospitals. But it also gives us more options. Any contact tracing programme or system of local lockdowns is far easier to implement when levels of the virus are low. The higher the number of cases, the fewer targeted measures the government has to use. The problem is once the circuit-break is over, cases would begin to rise again and it may take multiple circuit breaks to get us through winter. Meanwhile, new rules have been announcedfor north-west England, the Midlands and West Yorkshire, to come into force from Tuesday, in an effort to control the spread of the virus. Similar restrictions have already come into force in north-east England,affecting almost two million people, banning them from meeting people from other households and requiring restaurants and pubs to shut at 22:00 BST. But it is understood the government turned down down a request from the local council in Leeds to bring in early closing for bars and pubs there. Other parts of the UK under local lockdown conditions include- including Birmingham, Greater Manchester, Caerphilly, and the Belfast council area. The four nations of the UK are in charge of their own lockdown restrictions, withScotland,WalesandNorthern Irelandimplementing slightly different rules to England. The health secretary said the government's current approach was ""targeted interventions"" and stressed ""a national lockdown was the last line of defence"". ""The strategy is to keep the virus down as much as is possible whilst protecting education and the economy,"" Mr Hancock added. ""And throw everything at the science which eventually is the way we're going to spring out of this."" Prime Minister Boris Johnson is understood to be deeply reluctant to order another national lockdown, where everyone would be asked to stay at home and businesses to close.

Earlier this weekhe described the potential impactof this on the economy as ""disastrous"".  Chancellor Rishi Sunak is also understood to have warned ministers of the potential damage to the economy. The government is also concerned about the impact of more restrictions on daily life on those who need treatment for non-Covid related illnesses.

"Nearly two in three workers are now commuting again, as some employers ask their staff to return to offices during the pandemic. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said that,external62% of adult workers reported travelling to work last week. That compares with 36% in late May, soon after the ONS began compiling the figures during lockdown. The government has been encouragingworkers to return to offices to help revive city centres. While the proportion of people travelling to work has increased, the ONS said 10% of the workforce remained on furlough leave. It added that 20% of workers continued to do so exclusively from home. The commuter data includes people who may be travelling to work exclusively, or they may be doing a mixture of commuting and working from home, the ONS said. Business groups have warnedcity centres could become ""ghost towns"" if more staff do not return, damaging small businesses that rely on passing trade from office workers. However, new research released on Thursday by the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD) suggests that working from home could be a permanent fixture for many, following the pandemic. According to the survey of 1,000 employers, 37% believe staff will regularly avoid the journey into the office following Covid-19 - up from just 18% before the pandemic. TUC warns Chancellor to act to prevent a job loss 'tsunami' Next: Staff working from home 'miss out on camaraderie' 'Why I hate working from home' CIPD chief executive Peter Cheese said: ""The step-change shift to home working to adapt to lockdowns has taught us all a lot about how we can be flexible in ways of working in the future. ""Employers have learnt that, if supported and managed properly, home working can be as productive and innovative as office working and we can give more opportunity for people to benefit from better work-life balance."" However, he said it did not suit everyone and that organisations would have to design working arrangements around people's needs while ""also meeting the needs of the business"". The ONS also found that about one in 10 workers are still furloughed under the government's job retention scheme.

"Nearly two in three workers are now commuting again, as some employers ask their staff to return to offices during the pandemic. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said that,external62% of adult workers reported travelling to work last week. That compares with 36% in late May, soon after the ONS began compiling the figures during lockdown. The government has been encouragingworkers to return to offices to help revive city centres. While the proportion of people travelling to work has increased, the ONS said 10% of the workforce remained on furlough leave. It added that 20% of workers continued to do so exclusively from home. The commuter data includes people who may be travelling to work exclusively, or they may be doing a mixture of commuting and working from home, the ONS said. Business groups have warnedcity centres could become ""ghost towns"" if more staff do not return, damaging small businesses that rely on passing trade from office workers. However, new research released on Thursday by the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD) suggests that working from home could be a permanent fixture for many, following the pandemic. According to the survey of 1,000 employers, 37% believe staff will regularly avoid the journey into the office following Covid-19 - up from just 18% before the pandemic. TUC warns Chancellor to act to prevent a job loss 'tsunami' Next: Staff working from home 'miss out on camaraderie' 'Why I hate working from home' CIPD chief executive Peter Cheese said: ""The step-change shift to home working to adapt to lockdowns has taught us all a lot about how we can be flexible in ways of working in the future. ""Employers have learnt that, if supported and managed properly, home working can be as productive and innovative as office working and we can give more opportunity for people to benefit from better work-life balance."" However, he said it did not suit everyone and that organisations would have to design working arrangements around people's needs while ""also meeting the needs of the business"". The ONS also found that about one in 10 workers are still furloughed under the government's job retention scheme. Under the scheme, workers placed on leave have been able to receive 80% of their pay, up to a maximum of Â£2,500 a month. That level is likely to fall in coming weeks as the government has started to scale back the amount of money it pays out to furloughed workers.

Mr Obama writes about the response to the global financial crisis, his landmark healthcare reform legislation known as the Affordable Care Act or Obamacare, and the 2011 US raid in Pakistan that killed al-Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden. The 44th president of the US has written three previous books, including Dreams From My Father and The Audacity of Hope as well as the children's book Of Thee I Sing. His wife, lawyer and former First Lady Michelle Obama, has published her own memoir. Within five months of publication,Becoming had sold more than 10 million copies.

Both Nancy Reagan and Betty Ford's memoirs outsold their husbands' works. President Ronald Reagan however may not have minded. His work, An American Life, was ghost written by the journalist Robert Lindsey.At the book's launch Mr Reagan said,external: ""I hear it's a terrific book. One of these days I'm going to read it myself."" There were rumours in the 19th century that the Personal Memoirs of Ulysses S Grant by the post-Civil War president was in fact penned by the famous US writer Mark Twain, whose company published the work. Mr Twain however denied the allegation, andeditors of Mr Grant's papers have dismissed the claim as ""completely baseless"",external, as much of what was published still survives as notes handwritten by Mr Grant himself. President Grant's 584-page tome eventually became one of the highest-selling books of the 19th century.

It has already battered Florida and Alabama with rain and storm surges, downing power lines, turning roads into rivers and leaving homes submerged. One person was killed, and hundreds of thousands are without power. Sally has now weakened to a post-tropical cyclone, but meteorologists warn that tornadoes are still possible. Houses were submerged in Pensacola, Florida The wind ripped the roof off this house in Perdido Key, Florida Besides the fatality reported in Orange Beach, Alabama, one person is also missing from the small coastal city in south-west Alabama, according to Mayor Tony Kennon. ""It was an unbelievably freaky right turn of a storm that none of us ever expected,"" he told the Washington Post. Pensacola, Florida, 30m (48 km) east of Orange Beach, was also badly hit, with a loose barge bringing down part of the city's Bay Bridge. This video can not be played ""That's my car... submerged"": Video shows flooded streets in Pensacola, Florida Downtown Pensacola was hit with up to 5ft of flooding and saw the highest storm surge on record. The storm brought ""four months of rain in four hours"" to the city, Pensacola fire chief Ginny Cranor told CNN. Pictures show residents wading through waist-deep water, cars stranded in flooded streets, and homes entirely swamped by Wednesday's deluge. In Gulf Shores, Alabama - near where Sally first made landfall as a hurricane on Wednesday - the storm sheared off the face of a beachside apartment complex. And 50 miles  (80km) north-west in Mobile, Alabama, photos show the large steeple of El-Bethel Primitive Baptist Church toppled after the storm. Sally hit Gulf Shores, Alabama, at 04:45 local time on Wednesday, with maximum wind speeds of 105mph (169 km/h). According to the National Hurricane Center (NHC), Category 2 hurricanes havesustained winds of 96 to 110 mph,external. The NHC says a Category 2 storm's ""extremely dangerous winds"" usually cause damage to homes and shallowly rooted trees. As the storm moved north from the coast, some 550,000 residents in affected areas were left in the dark on Wednesday night, according to local reports. Now a post-tropical cyclone, the storm is expected to deposit up to 10in (25cm) of rain in Virginia and the Carolinas. It will likely cause widespread flash flooding, the NHC said on Thursday. Maximum wind speeds have decreased to 25mph as the storm moves north-east. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Footballer Lionel Messi can register his name as a trademark after a nine-year legal battle, the EU's top court has ruled. The European Court of Justice dismissed an appeal from Spanish cycling company Massi and the EU's intellectual property office, EUIPO. The Barcelona footballer first applied to trademark his surname as a sportswear brand in 2011. But Massi argued the similarity between their logos would cause confusion. Liverpool FC fails in bid to trademark city's name The European Court of Justice (ECJ) said that the star player's reputation could be taken into account when weighing up whether the public would be able to tell the difference between the two brands. In doing so, it upheld a ruling by the EU's General Court in 2018 that the footballer was too well known for confusion to arise. Massi, which sells cycle clothing and equipment, was successful in its initial challenge to the Barcelona striker's application.  But it lost out when Lionel Messi brought an appeal to the General Court, which ruled in his favour. Messi, 33, who wears the number 10 shirt, has been crowned world football player of the year a record six times and is the world's highest-paid soccer player, according to Forbes. It puts his total earnings for 2020 at $126m (Â£97m). In August, he made headlines by sending a fax to his club declaring his intention to leave. But when Barcelona responded by insisting that any team that took him on would have to honour a â¬700m (Â£624m) release clause, he changed his mind, saying he did not want to face ""the club I love"" in court.

"Government plans to amend a controversial bill that overrides sections of the Brexit divorce deal have been rejected by former Tory leader Lord Howard. The peer said the compromise between No 10 and Tory MPs ""isn't enough"" for him to back it in the House of Lords. The proposed changes would hand the Commons a say before powers to break international law could be used. MPs will vote on them next week, before the bill heads to the Lords. Boris Johnson reached a deal with Conservative MPs on Wednesday, in a move to head off a potential rebellion from his backbenchers over the Internal Market Bill. On Wednesday Lord Keen, Scotland's Advocate General, became the second senior government legal officerto quit over the bill. A compromise... but No 10 is not backing down PM in compromise with Tory critics over Brexit bill How could the Northern Ireland Brexit deal change? The government has nowpublished an amendment,externalto the bill, which would prevent ministers from activating new powers it gives them to override the Brexit divorce deal until MPs had voted to approve it first. The change is similar to those proposed by senior Tory backbencher Sir Bob Neill, who will now drop an amendment he had planned on the issue. Ministers have also tabled amendments to the bill that would place a time-limit on any attempts to question the legality of the controversial sections by judicial review. But Lord Howard, who was Conservative leader between 2003 and 2005, told the BBC: ""The government is still asking Parliament to break international law."" He added that even with the government's proposed changes, the chances of the bill being approved by the House of Lords were currently ""not great."" Asked if the matter could lead to a stand-off between the Commons and the Lords over the issue, he said: ""I think it may go beyond that"". ""I don't know what my colleagues will do, but as far as I'm concerned this is a matter of principle,"" added the Brexit-backing peer. This video can not be played Boris Johnson said on Wednesday he did not believe the EU was negotiating a post-Brexit trade deal in good faith. The government's changes to bill were welcomed by senior Tory backbencher Sir Roger Gale, who hadthreatenedto vote against it if no changes were made. In a tweet on Thursday, he wrote: ""At least Parliament will now have the chance to vote again if the government proposes to change the withdrawal agreement"". But Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said his party did not support the government's bill, adding its powers to break international law were ""wrong"". ""The latest fudge by way of amendments doesn't take the problem away, it just changes the problem,"" he told reporters in Scotland. Mr Johnson has argued the new powers in the bill are only required as a ""legal safety net"" in case ongoing talks with the EU over detailed arrangements for the Irish border break down. In apolicy paper published on Thursday,external, the government said the powers would only be triggered if the EU undermined the ""fundamental purpose"" of these negotiations. It listed examples of what it said would constitute such behaviour, including if the EU insisted on export declarations for goods sent to Great Britain from Northern Ireland. It also pledged that if it did decide to use powers to override the Brexit divorce deal, it would begin formal dispute settlement talks with the EU at the same time. Defending the bill on Wednesday, the prime minister said he believed the EU may not be negotiating with the UK in good faith during talks over a post-Brexit trade deal. The EU has reacted angrily to the bill, threatening legal action and the possible suspension of trade talks if the measures overriding the withdrawal agreement are not withdrawn. Asked to comment on the government's planned changes to the legislation, the European Commission said it would not comment on ""internal discussions"" between British ministers and MPs. However chief spokesman Eric Mamer said an EU request for the UK to withdraw the sections of the bill before the end of September ""has not changed"". On Mr Johnson's claim the EU had not been negotiating in good faith, he said agreements the EU had struck with countries around the world showed the bloc had a ""rather splendid track record"" in this area. He added that the EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier had demonstrated he could negotiate in good faith, even on ""politically sensitive issues"", during talks to conclude the UK's withdrawal deal, which entered into force in February. Informal talks on a trade agreement are continuing in Brussels this week, ahead of another full-scale negotiation round later this month. A UK Government spokesperson described the talks as ""useful"" and said ""some limited progress was made"". However they added that ""significant gaps remain in key areas, including fisheries and subsidies"". The European Commission chief, Ursula von der Leyen, said she was ""convinced"" a trade deal remains possible with the UK but called Mr Johnson's attempt to override the Brexit treaty an ""unpleasant surprise"". She said the Internal Market Bill ""distracted very strongly"" from the two sides being able to secure fresh trade terms. The bill sets out rules for the operation of the UK internal market - trade between England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland - after the end of the Brexit transition period in January. It proposes: No new checks on goods moving from Northern Ireland to the rest of Great Britain Giving UK ministers powers to modify or ""disapply"" rules relating to the movement of goods that will come into force from 1 January if the UK and EU are unable to reach an alternative agreement through a trade deal Powers to override previously agreed obligations on state aid - government support for businesses. The bill explicitly states that these powers should apply even if they are incompatible with international law. Ministers say the legislation is needed to prevent ""damaging"" tariffs on goods travelling from the rest of the UK to Northern Ireland if negotiations with the EU on a free trade agreement fail.

"The new rules cover Newcastle Sunderland, Northumberland, North and South Tyneside, Gateshead and the Durham County Council area New rules have been introduced across large swathes of north-east England in an attempt to stop the spread of the coronavirus. What has the reaction in the region been? The seven affected councilshave identified people socialising as a key common factor in the rise of coronavirus cases across the area. So since midnight on Thursday, almost two million people have been banned from meeting with other households, while pubs and restaurants and restaurants can only offer table service and have to shut at 22:00. The move has promoted a mixture of confusion, concern and incredulity among many. New restrictions in north-east England Live updates on new North East regulations Which areas are under lockdown and what are the rules? Nick Greaves, who runs The Patricia restaurant in Jesmond, Newcastle, said the new measures, which were a mixture of rules and guidelines, must nots and should nots, were confusing, worrying and ""a bit of a nightmare"". ""It's a bit of a shock,"" he said. ""We have come so far to get back on our feet and now we are back down in this saga again."" He said the 22:00 curfew put the restaurant ""in an awkward position"". ""We have changed the restaurant to have people much more spaced out time wise, in three sittings almost,"" Mr Greaves said. ""It's going to take out that 20:30 table sitting."" The Patricia now effectively has three sittings for meals He said the restaurant offered a six-course menu that took about two-and-a-half hours to work through. Mr Greaves also said he couldn't understand how the rules would help stop the spread of the coronavirus. ""It could even be a little bit dangerous with people going to the pub, necking as much as they can and then they end up drunk and are like 'let's go to a house or something'. ""I can't get my head around that's going to help anything. The virus is still as dangerous before 22:00 as it is afterwards."" This video can not be played Coronavirus: North East new restrictions reaction That's a concern shared by Spencer Hughes who lives in Sunderland and whose wife Jaci is a waitress at a social club in South Hylton which is open from 11:00 to 23:00. ""I don't see how closing an hour earlier will make any difference to the chances of getting the coronavirus,"" Mr Hughes said. ""As for other pubs which would normally be open later, I think people are just going to change their drinking habits. ""They will go out drinking earlier and once they've had a few, how much are they really going to be adhering to the social distancing as they were when they had their first pint?"" He said there was too much confusion over what was a rule and what was a guideline, with people able to interpret the latter to suit their own needs. Becci Nye is manager of the Fifteas Vintage tearoom in Bishop Auckland Becci Nye, manager of Fifteas Vintage tearoom in Bishop Auckland, also said the confusion between what you must not do and what you were advised not to do was posing a problem. The regulations ban people from visiting another household, including going to private gardens, apart from within a support bubble. And they advise people not to meet with other households at public venues, although Newcastle director of public health Eugene Milne said it would be alright in parks if people adhered to social distancing guidelines. ""I think people just need clear instructions,"" Ms Nye said, adding: ""Like right, 'you can mix, you can't mix'. ""Can you come with your neighbour, can you meet your mam in a tearoom rather than your house?"" She said she did not expect to see much of a change. ""I don't think the big tables will be booked any more but other than that I think it will be quite samey,"" she said. Mr Hughes in Sunderland also wasn't sure how well the rules would be followed. ""When we first went into lockdown and people didn't know much about the virus then everyone went with it,"" he said. ""Now there is a split, some people haven't been affected by it and don't even think it's real or claim it's the government trying to control them. ""But others like me have lost friends to it, we know it's there and what it does. ""What's needed are clear definitive rules that are scientifically proven that everybody sticks to."" Speaking to BBC Newcastle, Mr Milne said it would be ""very hard"" to enforce rules about people mixing in public places, saying: ""How would a pub know if people coming in together did actually live together or not?""

If scientists succeed in making a coronavirus vaccine, when will we get it, how much will it cost and who will get it first? The number of under-17s seeking Covid-19 tests has doubled, the head of NHS Test and Trace tells MPs. That's the end of our live coverage for today as nearly two million people across the North East will seestricter coronavirus restrictions from midnight after a spike in cases. Here's some of the key points:  We'll have more tomorrow from 08:00. If you're affected by these changes and you want to get in touch, or if you have any questions you cantweet us,external, contact us via ourFacebook page,externaloremail us. Take care.  Among the many questions Newcastle City Council has endeavoured to answer today is what to do if people see others breaking the rules. ""Where people
are breaking the rules, we will seek to engage, explain and encourage them to
adhere to the restrictions,"" the council said, adding: ""However, enforcement action will be taken where
appropriate."" It suggests people should report breaches to the police, while concerns about businesses can be sent to the seven councils in the affected areas. ""Once the
legislation is in place, the police or the local authority will be able to take
action against those who break these rules, including asking people to disperse
and issuing fixed penalty notices starting at Â£100 for those who participate in
illegal gatherings,"" a council spokesman said. People aged
18 or over could be fined Â£100 for the first offence, lowered to Â£50 if paid within
14 days, and Â£200 for the second offence, then doubling for each
further offence up to a maximum of Â£3,200. A heavily-pregnant woman has told of the ""misery"" of trying to get a coronavirus test for her ill daughter. Verity Ward from South Shields booked for her three-year-old daughter Romilly to be tested at Doxford Park in Sunderland at 13:30 today after the youngster became ill overnight. Ms Ward is 38 weeks pregnant and due to have a Caesarean operation in the next few days so needs to know if the virus has infected her household. But she and her partner got stuck in a queue on the A19 which had backed up from the testing centre. ""We saw some police cars go up past us, and then eventually a man came down and told each car that the computers at the centre had crashed and they weren't going to be able to do any tests,"" she said. ""As we did a three-point-turn to leave, we saw police stopping other cars from joining the queue so at least those people didn't have to endure the misery. ""As for us, I guess we try again tomorrow. I've got a lot of hospital appointments coming up and I really can't be doing 14 days isolation. I want to know if I'm safe."" Measures to stop households mixing and early pub closures will come into effect from midnight. Eugene Milne, the director of public health in Newcastle, said the seven local authorities are awaiting the final regulations from the government. He said: ""That requires the Department of Health lawyers to comb over them and make sure there is a clear line about which parts are under law and which are advice. I'm hoping we will have those this afternoon. ""This is a very fast moving situation and we would like to get that clarity out to everybody."" He said the government had ""in the main"" granted what the councils had asked for and it was about ""treading a line"" between maintaining enough of the economy that can run within guidance [which] at the same time addresses the problems we have seen"". ""It is the balance of keeping things going as much as we can while controlling the virus, we don't want to flip-flop between lockdown and rapid viral spread on the other hand."" The measures affect seven council areas and come into force from midnight on Thursday. More than 100 people are currently waiting in cars at an empty Sunderland car park, where they say they have been booked in for coronavirus testing. People are arriving at the site, but no staff or equipment are there. Drivers are arriving with print outs of their appointments but no Covid-19 testing is available.

The area covering seven North East councils isnot the first to have local measures put in place: BBC Newcastle Residents of the seven affected North East areas are being advised not to visit people outside of those places, Newcastle's director of public health said. Asked if people could make such visits, Eugene Milne said: ""Again we would advise against that. The restrictions we asked for is for people to be able to travel outside the area but not to meet with people from other households. ""This is about he spread of the virus. We know already with some of the spread we have seen in the region it's happened because of that type of mixing. We want to put a lid on that and get the spread under a manageable level.""  Here are some questions and answers from Newcastle City Council: Can I have someone in my house or go
into someoneâs houseto do repairs or other work? Official tradespeople can go to other peopleâs
homes for work as long as they follow guidance on how to work
safely. Can I still go on holiday? You can still
go on holiday in the UK or abroad, but you should only do this with people
you live with or have a support bubble with. You need to follow rules in the area you visit and be aware of the self-isolation laws when
travelling to and from certain countries. People can
visit the region on holiday but must comply with the local restrictions. What about public transport and car
sharing? Residents are
advised to only use public transport for essential purposes, such as travelling
to school or work. Face
coverings must be worn unless exempt. You are
advised not to share a car with those outside your household or support bubble,
and to use public transport for essential journeys instead. Are the airport, train stations and
ports still open? Newcastle
Airport, train stations and ports remain open and members of the public are
permitted to travel to and from them. Can I move home? Yes It is âquite hard to give you an accurate figureâ on demand for virus tests, says Test and Trace boss. Francesca WilliamsBBC News Within minutes of the new coronavirus restrictions for the North East being published - and even before then - there were questions. Real life doesn't fit neatly into a set of general guidelines and among the many clarifications people were seeking was whether grandparents could carry on looking after children while parents went to work.  The government said no, but Newcastle City Council said it had been lobbying for them to be excluded from the ban on mixing outside a household or support bubble. The discussions, we're told, are still continuing between local and central government on this one. And none of this is made easier by the fact that the government version of what the rules will be is already circulating on social media, while the council's leader insists the official regulations haven't been published yet. Another problem area identified as causing an increase in coronavirus cases is amateur sport. Here are Newcastle City's Council's answers to some of your questions:. What are the changes to playing
sports? Unless
formally organised by a club or organisation, with guidance
issued by a governing body, team sports should not take place anywhere with people who you donât live with. You should
not watch any sports, including professional and
semi-professional events. Can I travel to play sport outside of
the areas with restrictions? Yes, and a face mask should be worn on public transport unless exempt. Can I go to the gym, class or a
swimming pool? Yes, as long
as these venues have the required guidelines
in place. The cancellation follows the announcement of tighter restrictions in the North East. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Positive,1.0

Nick Greaves, who runs The Patricia in Jesmond, said: ""It's a bit of a shock. We have come so far to get back on our feet and now we are back down in this saga again."" He said the 22:00 curfew puts his restaurant ""in an awkward position"". ""We have changed the restaurant to have people much more spaced out time wise, in three sittings almost,"" Mr Greaves said.

Mr Greaves also said he couldn't understand how the rules would help stop the spread of the coronavirus. ""It could even be a little bit dangerous with people going to the pub, necking as much as they can and then they end up drunk and are like 'let's go to a house or something'.

It can be hard to judge which one you may have. Most people who feel ill with coronaviruswill have at least one of the key symptoms:  Read our explainer hereon the other things to look for out for. Lucy WilliamsonBBC News, Marseille Whatâs striking, as you enter the main intensive care unit
at Marseilleâs La Timone hospital, is the laughter and banter of the
staff.  Protection comes in many different guises. Around them, in isolation rooms, are 13 seriously ill
patients with coronavirus. Each time they enter, the medical teams need
to step into full, zip-up body suits, and put on masks and gloves. For the
riskiest operations, they add helmets, and portable ventilators to purify the
air inside them as they work. On the day we visit, doctors are trying to save the life of
a 65-year-old man on life support.  Looking more like astronauts than
medical staff, they step inside the glass screen, and thread a camera down the
patientâs throat. Theyâre checking for blockages before trying to oxygenate
his blood by machine â a last resort. The ghostly figures hovering around his bed are the
patientâs only visitors. His wife calls the unit once or twice every day
for news.  But contamination risks mean sheâs not allowed in to see him. This unit is now the epicentre of Franceâs new Covid crisis. The director of public hospitals in Marseille has said the city is ânearing saturationâ and that 100 extra staff have been recruited
in the past week, to try and keep pace with demand. Rates of infection here are now twice that of Paris. More than 10% of those tested here are positive. But despite France meeting its target of a million tests a
week, many people are facing long waits for testing or results. The government has told testing centres to prioritise those
with symptoms or confirmed contact with cases, but the health minister today
admitted there were still problems including bottlenecks in big cities. As Canada moves into the
cooler days of autumn, people in parts of the country will see social
gatherings being newly restricted as Covid-19 cases surge. In some parts of the province of Ontario - including Toronto, Canada's largest city - outdoor gatherings will
now be restricted to a maximum of 25, down from 100. Indoor gatherings are no
limited to 10, down from 50. That includes backyard
parties and picnics, provincial Premier Doug Ford said, warning of hefty fines
for rule-breakers. â ""We will throw the
book at you if you break the rules,"" he said. Party hosts could receive fines of C$10,000 ($7,500; Â£5,800), with attendees getting C$750
tickets. Ford called partygoers
who have been reckless ""a few fries short of a Happy Meal"". Covid-19 cases have been
increasing though they still are lower than in the months of April and May.
There were 293 new cases in Ontario today. Toronto, the nearby Peel Region, and Canada's capital Ottawa are hotspots in the province. Captain Sir Tom Moore has launched his charitable foundation after raising more than Â£32m for NHS charities during lockdown. He said he wanted to help those going through difficulties, referring to his late wife Pamela's struggles with mental health. He said the foundation will support people ""where a little bit of hope will do them some good"". Speaking to BBC Breakfast's Naga Munchetty from his garden, he said his wife's mental health problems started when she was a child and got worse and worse. When Capt Sir Tom could no longer look after her properly, she went into a home. She was expected to be treated for six weeks but stayed until she died from dementia. The inspiration for his foundation, called The Captain Tom Foundation, came from seeing many ""lonely"" ladies in the home who had no visitors, he said. ""That's one of the things that the foundation is, to help lonely people and people who are in difficulties, not just old people, there are some young people that are not properly looked after."" Laura KuenssbergPolitical editor Nearly 10 million people's lives are under limits again. The number of coronavirus cases is rising fast. Concerned members of the public are stuck in frustrated queues for coronavirus tests in some parts of the country. The tide was not turned. Life is not back to normal. And even some Conservative MPs are asking, what on earth is going on? Read the full blog here. France has ramped up testing for coronavirus Staff at coronavirus laboratories in France have joined a strike, protesting against poor working conditions. The CGT labour union told Reuters news agency that several hundred staff from coronavirus laboratories were taking part in the action, and that it was disrupting testing in some towns. The union said the strike could drag on if laboratory bosses failed to deal with complaints over staff shortages and pay. ""We're overwhelmed,"" one laboratory nurse told Reuters. ""We're exhausted, physically and mentally."" A technician told the news agency the pace of work was ârelentlessâ and that workers were doing free overtime. France has ramped up testing for coronavirus, and now conducts more than one million tests a week, according to officials. But people have complained of long queues at testing centres and delays in receiving results. A representative of employers in the sector said the strike was having a minimal impact on testing. Like other countries in Europe, France has reported a surge in coronavirus cases in recent weeks. How the National Theatre's Olivier Theatre will look when it reopens The National Theatre, on London's South Bank,is to reopen after remodelling its largest stage. The Olivier can usually seat 1,150 people. But when it opens in October, there will be an audience of just under 500, watching performances in the round. A new play called Death of England: Delroy is first to be staged, before pantomime returns to the National Theatre as a one-off, with performances of Dick Whittington in December. The venue - closed since 16 March - said it was ""delighted and relieved to be reopening"". Marianna SpringDisinformation and social media reporter A
video being widely shared on Facebook and Instagram is being accompanied by
false claims that receiving a coronavirus vaccine has already been made
mandatory and that it will be used to inject microchips into people. The video, originally posted on TikTok and viewed over 3 million times, does
not itself refer to coronavirus.  In it, a British woman says her daughter
was vaccinated at school without her consent and she doesnât know âwhat sheâs
had put in herâ. The
shared video has been accompanied by false claims that a coronavirus vaccine
has already been made mandatory in the UK and that it will be used to inject
microchips into people. Weâve
looked into these claims before, andthere is currently no legislation in
the UK making vaccines mandatory- although the government has not ruled
this out for a coronavirus vaccine in the future. There is also absolutely no
evidence that a vaccine will be a tool to microchip or deliberately cause harm
to individuals. According
to subsequent videos being shared, this womanâs daughter was administered the
HPV vaccine - even though she had said she did not want her daughter to receive
it. This vaccine protects against high-risk HPV infections, which can lead
to many cervical cancers - and some others. The woman in the video points out that there is a clause on the NHS website
that states if a parent does not consent to a child receiving the HPV vaccine
âthe nurse can override my decision and vaccinate my children if they show an
interest in having this doneâ.While this is true, the child still has to indicate consent,external. There is a ""high risk"" that a spike in Covid cases will lead to more hospital admissions and deaths in locked-down areas of Wales, health officials have warned. Dr Robin Howe, of Public Health Wales, said older people are being infected in Caerphilly and Rhondda Cynon Taf. It comes as people in Rhondda expressed frustration atbecoming the second area in Wales to return to lockdown after Caerphilly. Strict rules came into force at 18:00 BST for the area's 240,000 residents.

But the plan was axed by White House officials who felt it would create a panic among Americans, an unnamed White House officialtold the Post,external. ""There was concern from some in the White House Domestic Policy Council and the office of the vice president that households receiving masks might create concern or panic,"" the official said.

Ripdorf fielded the minimum number of players possible in the game on Sunday because their opponents, SV Holdenstedt II, had come into contact with someone who tested positive for coronavirus in a recent match. Their team tested negative but Ripdorf said the conditions were not safe. Ripdorf asked for the match to be postponed but the local association refused, and the team would have faced a â¬200 (Â£182) fine if they had not played.

In person-learning was set to begin on Monday. Instead, the city is phasing the return of students to the classroom, with only pre-kindergarten children and students with special learning needs now set to start on Monday. Under the new plans, first grade to eighth grade students will begin on 29 September, while middle- and high-school students will start on 1 October. Students will continue with remote-learning in the meantime. It is the second time the mayor has delayed the return to classrooms, which was originally due to happen on 10 September. The mayor is expected to give more details later. Wearing masks is now compulsary in some parts of France As Europe grapples with a significant rise in cases, governments are introducing measures to try to control the spread of coronavirus. Some of those measures are reintroduced restrictions from the first lockdowns earlier this year. In France masks must worn outdoors in some areas by anyone aged 11 and over, including busy streets in Paris. They must also be worn in workplaces. And in Germany, testing is compulsory for arrivals at airports from high-risk countries. Read more about what European countries are doing to try to limit the spread of infection.  Congressman Clyburn called the comparison ""the most ridiculous, tone-deaf, God-awful thing I've ever heard"" US Attorney General William Barr, a top Trump appointee and the highest ranking US law enforcement official, has drawn fire for comparing Covid-19 lockdown orders to the historical US enslavement of black people. ""You know, putting a national lockdown, stay at home orders, is like house arrest. Other than slavery, which was a different kind of restraint, this is the greatest intrusion on civil liberties in American history,"" he told a college in Michigan on Wednesday. In a CNN interview, Democratic Congressman James Clyburn - the highest-ranked African-American in the House of Representatives - slammed the remark as ""the most ridiculous, tone-deaf, God-awful thing I've ever heard"". ""It is incredible that the chief law enforcement officer in this country would equate human bondage to expert advice to save lives. Slavery was not about saving lives, it was about devaluing lives."" He pointed out that the federal government never instituted a lockdown, and they were instead ordered by the states. Congressman Hakeem Jeffries, who is also black, took issue with Barr's description of slavery as a form of ârestraint,â telling CNN it was actually âone of the worst crimes against humanity ever committedâ. The UK government has removed Slovenia and the French Caribbean island of Guadeloupe from England's safe travel list, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has announced. Mr Shapps said people in Slovenia and Guadeloupe who arrive after 04:00 on Saturday will need to self-isolate for 14 days. The government also announced that passengers arriving back from Singapore and Thailand will not be required to quarantine as those countries have been added to the safe travel list. The Scottish Government has confirmed the changes announced today will also apply there.  Smitha MundasadNews reporter The World Health Organization has repeated its plea for countries not to shorten the quarantine period for people who have been exposed to coronavirus. The global health body recommends anyone who has been in close contact with someone who has definitely got coronavirus or probably has, should stay at home or somewhere similar for two weeks. The idea is simple -  to monitor people in case they get ill and spot Covid-19 cases early on, preventing the virus from spreading further. The Centrers for Disease Control and Prevention in the US, for example, says based on the best current studies, it is likely that the time from someone being exposed to getting symptoms is between two and 14 days. It's evidence like this that is behind the WHO's advice. And in the UK  if you are told by the Test and Trace system that you have had close contact with someone who has coronavirus, you must isolate for 14 days. But France is reportedly taking a different approach. It is slashing its isolation time from 14 fourteen days to seven. That's because health experts there say the majority of people find it too difficult to isolate for a whole two weeks. They also say this is when people are most likely to be infectious. There are also some small studies that suggest people are most likely to pass on the virus in the first week they have symptoms. But the science is still emerging and scientists across the globe agree there are still many uncertainties. That's why different countries have different approaches - each has to balance the evidence, the unknowns and the chance for citizens to get back to a more normal life. NHS Test and Trace chief Baroness Dido Harding is asked about test turnaround times. She acknowledges tests have been taking ""slightly longer than usual"" in the last ""week or so"". People are waiting longer for coronavirus test results from England's community testing centres, figures showed today. Only a third of tests carried out in these venues came back in 24 hours in the week up to 9 September. Baroness Harding says: ""We have very consciously in the last couple of weeks, when we've seen the very significant increase in demand, made use of every single day of the seven days of lab capacity to try and maximise the total number of people who have been tested. ""And what that has meant is that for some people the testing turnarounds have gone out a bit."" Â© 2025 BBC.

"Staff working from home for fashion retailer Next have been ""stultified"" by boring online presentations and missed out on office camaraderie, the company said. Next said that overall, the impact of the pandemic on business had been ""expensive and miserable"". But it had also seen some advantages from the upheaval, it added. Next said it expected some home working to continue and that the balance would ""evolve over time"". Along with all ""non-essential"" retailers, Next was forced to close its doors when the pandemic struck. But it continued to meet online orders after overhauling work practices at its warehouses to allow for social distancing. Announcing its financial results for the first six months of the year, including a 34% drop in sales over the worst of the lockdown, the fashion chain said some good had come from the experience. 'Nine in 10 would continue working from home' The ironing-board desk and other WFH inventions Bad backs and wobbly tables: 'I hate working from home' ""It is remarkable what can be learnt from shutting down your entire operation and slowly, department by department, store by store, warehouse by warehouse, bringing it back to life,"" Next said in a statement. Warehouses and call centres had become more efficient, while staff in other areas had been forced to make more of new technology, it said. However, it said having staff ""sitting in their spare bedrooms, kitchens and conservatories"" had had pros and cons. Video calls for large groups had proved ""unwieldy, frustrating and inefficient"". ""Worst of all, perhaps, large video calls have encouraged the proliferation of one of the business world's most damaging practices - death by deck,"" it said. Explaining further, it said this meant ""slideshow presentations that transform meetings from productive exchanges of ideas into boring, one-way lectures, with the 'presenters' rattling through bullet points already visible to their stultified audience"". Online sales held up during lockdown, with childrens' wear and sportswear performing strongly Next said the biggest problem with home working was the lack of spontaneous conversations and the chance to learn from colleagues. On the other hand, it had allowed people to focus more effectively on some solitary tasks, including systems coding and product design. Next said that had empowered individuals and been liberating. Millions of UK workers switched to working partly or completely from home when the country went into lockdown in March. Many welcomed the break from the daily commute and office politics, but the government is keen to encourage workers back into the office to revive city centres. Firms have taken a mixed approach. Some, such as Twitter, say employees might continue to work from home even after the threat from the virus subsides. Netflix boss Reed Hastings, however, wants staff to return to the office ""12 hours after a vaccine is approved"". Next's 34% fall in sales saw wedding outfits and work clothes particularly badly hit. However, it said the business had been ""more resilient than we expected"", with pre-tax profit totalling Â£9m for the first half of the year. It said it was fortunate that half of its revenues were already coming from online sales before the onset of the pandemic. It has revised its profit forecast for the full year from Â£195m to Â£300m. But it said that current rules to limit the spread of the virus, including the ""rule of six"", would depress demands for gifts and clothing, if still in force in December.

"This video can not be played Manchester Arena Inquiry: Georgina Callander 'had heart as big as the moon' The father of Georgina Callander said she had a ""heart as big as the moon"" while her mother described her as ""one in many millions"". For two weeks, the relatives of the 22 people killed in the 2017 Manchester Arena bombing willprovide a personal insight into the lives of their loved onesand how their lives were changed forever. In a moving video Simon Callander, who was at the hearing, described how ""her laughter echoed all over the house"". ""Every day I hear her laugh,"" he said. The 18-year-old's mother Lesley Callander said in separate film played to the inquiry on Wednesday: ""She was like a beautiful melody who lit up the room with her famous smile."" She said she was ""my whole world"". Mr Callander opened his ""pen portrait"" by saying Georgina was born on April Fools' Day ""but I was the fool for not spending more time with her and not telling her he loved her every day"". ""Compassion was her hallmark. She didn't have a bad bone in her body,"" he said. ""She had so much love - and so much love to give."" He recalled how the teenager from Tarleton, Lancashire used to ""squeal with excitement"" opening her Christmas presents, kept her brothers Daniel and Harry out of trouble and her talent for art and how she loved taekwondo, ballet and football, playing for Bolton Wanderers Girls Football team. Georgina Callander was an Ariana Grande ""super fan"" He said he still looked out of the window every day to see her walking home from school. ""I would give anything to see her smiling face again."" Images of Georgina growing up were shown to the court accompanied by Lukas Graham's Love Someone, which features the line ""I'd stop the world if it gave us time"". Mr Callander recalled her part-time job at Booths, spending her wages on concerts and her pride at passing her driving test first time. She named her first car 'Peggy' which she drove to the concert on ""that horrific day"", he said. Georgina had been due to study children's nursing at Edge Hill University, but never got to go, he said. ""All that potential snatched away."" Mr Callander said: ""My life is unrecognisable [from] what it was. Ill health. Divorce. A black cloud that follows me constantly."" He said Georgina had been ""the glue that held the family together"". His recording ended with more family photographs including one of Georgina with her idol Ariana Grande as Rod Stewart's Love Has No Pride played. Georgina's mother Lesley Callander her daughter was ""my whole world"" Georgina's mother had earlier described her daughter as was ""one in many millions"" in her powerful tribute.

"This video can not be played Manchester Arena Inquiry: Georgina Callander 'had heart as big as the moon' The father of Georgina Callander said she had a ""heart as big as the moon"" while her mother described her as ""one in many millions"". For two weeks, the relatives of the 22 people killed in the 2017 Manchester Arena bombing willprovide a personal insight into the lives of their loved onesand how their lives were changed forever. In a moving video Simon Callander, who was at the hearing, described how ""her laughter echoed all over the house"". ""Every day I hear her laugh,"" he said. The 18-year-old's mother Lesley Callander said in separate film played to the inquiry on Wednesday: ""She was like a beautiful melody who lit up the room with her famous smile."" She said she was ""my whole world"". Mr Callander opened his ""pen portrait"" by saying Georgina was born on April Fools' Day ""but I was the fool for not spending more time with her and not telling her he loved her every day"". ""Compassion was her hallmark. She didn't have a bad bone in her body,"" he said. ""She had so much love - and so much love to give."" He recalled how the teenager from Tarleton, Lancashire used to ""squeal with excitement"" opening her Christmas presents, kept her brothers Daniel and Harry out of trouble and her talent for art and how she loved taekwondo, ballet and football, playing for Bolton Wanderers Girls Football team. Georgina Callander was an Ariana Grande ""super fan"" He said he still looked out of the window every day to see her walking home from school. ""I would give anything to see her smiling face again."" Images of Georgina growing up were shown to the court accompanied by Lukas Graham's Love Someone, which features the line ""I'd stop the world if it gave us time"". Mr Callander recalled her part-time job at Booths, spending her wages on concerts and her pride at passing her driving test first time. She named her first car 'Peggy' which she drove to the concert on ""that horrific day"", he said. Georgina had been due to study children's nursing at Edge Hill University, but never got to go, he said. ""All that potential snatched away."" Mr Callander said: ""My life is unrecognisable [from] what it was. Ill health. Divorce. A black cloud that follows me constantly."" He said Georgina had been ""the glue that held the family together"". His recording ended with more family photographs including one of Georgina with her idol Ariana Grande as Rod Stewart's Love Has No Pride played. Georgina's mother Lesley Callander her daughter was ""my whole world"" Georgina's mother had earlier described her daughter as was ""one in many millions"" in her powerful tribute. She said she would have attended the hearing in person but ever since the attack she ""could not bear"" to be in Manchester.

"People queue for tests in Southampton People up and down the country have been blocked from getting coronavirus tests in recent days, as appointments were paused with the system struggling to cope. Yet the government says capacity is higher than ever. So what's going on in the UK's testing system? Demand for tests has soared, no-one disputes that. What isn't clear is by how much. It's hard to know exactly - the figures aren't capturing all the people who've tried to book and haven't been able to get a test. The combination of people returning from holiday and children going back to school will have put pressure on the system. And early autumn will have brought other respiratory viruses, with symptoms similar to coronavirus - perhaps especially in children. For many, the message that it's essential to get a test if you have symptoms, will have sunk in. Dozens of people have told the BBC of doing so out of a feeling of civic duty. It's something the government appears to have ""underestimated"" the impact of with the rise in cases also coming sooner than thought, says Sir John Bell, of Oxford University. At the same time, sources have expressed concerns about the ""worried well"" - people applying for tests even if they don't have the relevant symptoms. Health Secretary Matt Hancock has claimed a quarter of people wanting tests do not have symptoms, and so are ineligible. When this was queried, the government said this figure was not a formal count. But it has pointed to reports of whole school year groups being told to get tested, and people asking for tests before and after going on holiday. All you need to know about testing Fact checked: Three government claims on testing UK coronavirus cases up by 3,105 on Tuesday Not enough tests for five months, study predicts There is no shortage of swabs, testing centres and staff. There are almost 400 testing centres in total across the UK, including drive-through and walk-in sites, mobile units set up in hotspots and satellite sites at hospitals and care homes. But getting an appointment at one of these has been a challenge, even though pictures have emerged of sites with hardly any people getting tested. Limited lab capacity means the releasing of new appointments is being held back. That's because once you take a swab, there's a narrow window of time to process it in before it becomes invalid. If the labs can't get to it in time, because they are dealing with yesterday's tests, that swab will be wasted. So when labs get behind, there's no point opening up new appointments to test people. The government says testing capacity - which it defines as how many can be processed in the lab each day - is higher than ever. This is true. The capacity has grown rapidly, with latest figures showing nearly 375,000 tests a day can be processed. But this covers a number of different types of tests. There are four ""pillars"" to the testing programme. The first is hospital testing, which is processed in hospital and university labs and reserved for patients and staff. The second is the testing n the community - and is the element of the system that there is currently so much focus on. The other two are an antibody testing programme, which looks at whether people have had the virus previously, and  a surveillance programme run by the Office for National Statistics. This is considered to be an essential way of keeping track of the spread of the virus. Community testing capacity represents less than half the total. And once we dig down more into this data, it becomes clear why tests have had to be rationed. Nearly all the community testing is processed at one of five mega-labs. Back in August it was clear they were close to capacity - in fact all the testing capacity was used up on 23 August. And this goes to the heart of the problem. These labs were built in super-quick time. Ministers often refer to it as the biggest diagnostic testing expansion in history. That is because the UK had very few diagnostic testing facilities of this type. So it chose to centralise the system at these large labs and has worked with a variety of partners, including private companies and universities, to run them. Prof Gordon Dougan, from the University of Cambridge, says it is not surprising they have run into problems and struggled to increase capacity to keep pace with demand. Despite ""valiant efforts, the system is not robust enough"" and is vulnerable to failure at multiple levels from sourcing equipment to finding the right staff, he says. It is understood that one of the biggest limitations is hiring enough qualified people to carry out the tests. YOUR QUESTIONS:We answer your queries THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters LOCAL LOCKDOWNS:What happens if you have one? TEST AND TRACE:How does it work? FURLOUGH:What happens when the scheme ends? This has become a particular issue as academics and post-graduate students have returned to their usual roles. Labs have been unable to offer academic staff contracts. More experienced staff have had to go back to their institutions. This has led to Prime Minister Boris Johnson writing letters to universities asking them to lend their staff and students for a little longer. It's not clear how many, if any, have agreed to this. In order to process more tests, labs will need more space, machines and people. This is happening, but it seems not fast enough to keep up with demand. Lab capacity is being increased. A sixth mega-lab in Newport is in the process of opening. A seventh near Loughborough will follow suit in the coming weeks. This should have a big impact on capacity. But meanwhile, the government has said it will have to prioritise - that means making sure hospitals, care homes and areas with outbreaks can get access to testing. Even when these new labs are fully up and running, there are concerns demand will still outstrip supply. Cases of coronavirus and other respiratory illnesses are going up, so it seems inevitable more people will be seeking access to tests. An analysis by Health Data Research UK warned that if just 80% of people with annual coughs and fevers applied for a test, capacity could be exceeded for the whole winter.

"The Bank of England has warned that the rising rate of coronavirus infections and a lack of clarity over the UK's future trade relationship with the EU could threaten the economic recovery. It said much of output lost during lockdown had been recovered but the outlook remained ""unusually uncertain"". The UK is still ina deep recession, while Covid-19 infections are at their highest level since mid May. Citing the uncertainty, the Bank held interest rates at 0.1%, a historic low. It added that it would continue its monetary support for the economy, but stopped short of increasing its bond-buying programme or reducing interest rates further. If you borrow money you usually have to pay a small fee set by the person lending to you. How high that fee - or interest rate - is depends on a ""base rate"" that is set by the Bank of England at meetings throughout the year. The rate determines how much banks have to pay to borrow money, and that has a knock-on effect on how much the bank charges consumers to borrow. When the economy is growing quickly the Bank tries to stop it overheating by raising interest rates, making it more expensive to borrow. When the economy is sluggish, cutting the Bank's base rate lowers the cost of borrowing and can encourage businesses and consumers to spend more. The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), which sets interest rate policy, said previous projections of economic recovery were ""on the assumption of an immediate, orderly move to a comprehensive free trade agreement with the European Union on 1 January 2021"". Economic recovery would also depend on the evolution of the pandemic and measures taken to protect public health, the MPC said. ""The recent increases in Covid-19 cases in some parts of the world, including the United Kingdom, have the potential to weigh further on economic activity, albeit probably on a lesser scale than seen earlier in the year,"" it said. No change from the Bank of England on record low interest rates, nor on its wider support for the economy. On the face of it, the economy is less weak than it expected even last month, but profound uncertainties remain. The Bank in particular pointed to ""recent increases in Covid-19"", including in the UK, that ""have the potential to weigh further on economic activity"", as well as a recent fall in sterling partly ""reflecting recent Brexit developments"". Given rates are at rock bottom already, sterling was further hit from the fact that the Bank's deliberations over rates included a presentation over how ""negative interest rates"" might work. The Bank had been concerned of the impact of, in effect, lenders paying borrowers for the health of parts of the banking system. It is, as it has previously signalled, looking at how this could be achieved in practice. Should the uncertainties visible to all materialise in the coming weeks for the UK, that extraordinary and unprecedented tool is being prepared as an option. The government has had to impose new social distancing restrictions across England, asrising caseshave forced many areas into local lockdowns. On Wednesday, the Prime Minister said the governmentwas doing ""everything in our power"" to prevent another nationwide lockdown, which could have ""disastrous"" financial consequences for the UK. The Bank of England said despite a stronger than expected recovery in the last few months, the economy was still about 7% smaller than at the end of last year. Usually if the economy is not growing strongly enough, the Bank of England considers lowering interest rates to encourage firms to invest and savers to spend. However, interest rates are already close to zero after two emergency rate cuts in March. Minutes from this month's meeting show that the MPC discussed the use of negative interest rates to stimulate the economy. Last month, the Bank's governor, Andrew Bailey, appeared to rule that out, though he said negative interest rates remained in the ""tool box"". If interest rates are negative the Bank of England charges for any deposits it holds on behalf of the banks. That encourages banks to lend the money to business rather than deposit it. What are negative interest rates? What exactly is the Bank of England interest rate? The Bank also signalled that it had no intention of raising interest rates until ""significant progress"" had been made in getting inflation back to the Bank's 2% target. It is currently at a five-year low of 0.2%. The Bank said it did not expect inflation to return to target levels for another two years. ""We expect interest rates to be no higher than 0.1% for the next five years,"" said Andrew Wishart, UK economist at Capital Economics.

"Footballer Lionel Messi can register his name as a trademark after a nine-year legal battle, the EU's top court has ruled. The European Court of Justice dismissed an appeal from Spanish cycling company Massi and the EU's intellectual property office, EUIPO. The Barcelona footballer first applied to trademark his surname as a sportswear brand in 2011. But Massi argued the similarity between their logos would cause confusion. Liverpool FC fails in bid to trademark city's name The European Court of Justice (ECJ) said that the star player's reputation could be taken into account when weighing up whether the public would be able to tell the difference between the two brands. In doing so, it upheld a ruling by the EU's General Court in 2018 that the footballer was too well known for confusion to arise. Massi, which sells cycle clothing and equipment, was successful in its initial challenge to the Barcelona striker's application.  But it lost out when Lionel Messi brought an appeal to the General Court, which ruled in his favour. Messi, 33, who wears the number 10 shirt, has been crowned world football player of the year a record six times and is the world's highest-paid soccer player, according to Forbes. It puts his total earnings for 2020 at $126m (Â£97m). In August, he made headlines by sending a fax to his club declaring his intention to leave. But when Barcelona responded by insisting that any team that took him on would have to honour a â¬700m (Â£624m) release clause, he changed his mind, saying he did not want to face ""the club I love"" in court.

"John Lewis has confirmed that staff will not receive a bonus for the first time since 1953 after it was hit by lockdown store closures. The retailer - which also owns Waitrose - posted a huge Â£635m pre-tax loss for the six months to 25 July after higher costs offset a 1% rise in sales. Its chairwoman told staff on Thursday the announcement ""will come as a blow"". Even before Covid-19 hit, the chain had warned it might not pay the usual staff bonus as competition ate into profits. The group's first-half loss was Â£635m once exceptional items were taken into account, including a Â£470m write-down in the value of its stores. Excluding those one-off costs, the group's loss in those six months stood at Â£55m. The last time that the chain, which operates as a partnership, decided not to pay a bonus to its staff was in the aftermath of World War Two. Chairwoman Dame Sharon White said: ""We came through then to be even stronger and we will do so again."" She added: ""I know this will come as a blow to partners who have worked so hard this year. The decision in no way detracts from the commitment and dedication that you have shown."" The payment of bonuses will only resume once annual profits rise to above Â£150m and debt falls, she said. John Lewis to pull 'Never knowingly undersold' pledge Shoppers 'won't let John Lewis go without a fight' The retailer said store closures during lockdown and customers buying less profitable items, such as toilet paper or laptops, had hit trade. It estimated that in its first half, John Lewis shops saw a Â£200m drop in sales, while the wider group saw additional coronavirus-related costs total about Â£50m. But in a statement, it said that its Waitrose supermarkets had seen ""a return to the weekly shop"", with like-for-like sales up 10% year-on-year. John Lewis has had a whopping half-year loss. But it was mainly down to some big one off costs, including a Â£470m impairment charge against the value of its department stores, reflecting the fact that they don't play as big a role as they used to. Stores have a halo effect in boosting online sales. Many shoppers browse before going home and ordering online. Before the crisis, John Lewis thought its department stores helped generate around Â£6 of every Â£10 spent online. John Lewis now thinks that figure is nearer Â£3. Eight John Lewis stores have closed, costing the business another Â£105m. These results lay bare the impact of the pandemic. But the the company says this is better than what it expected in April. John Lewis makes most of its profits in the second half of the year. Christmas is key. With the outcome still very uncertain, it now thinks the most likely outcome is a ""small loss or small profit"" for the full year. Dame Sharon said the pandemic had brought forward changes in consumer shopping habits ""which might have taken five years into five months"". At John Lewis stores, online sales surged by 73% in the six months to 25 July, ""helping to offset the impact of shop closures"". They now account for more than 60% of sales overall for the department store chain, up from 40% before the pandemic hit. The group added that a shift towards increased home working had affected people's purchases, with increased sales of tablets and TVs, while sales of trousers had declined. The chain also said that Waitrose was now delivering about 170,000 weekly food orders - up from 60,000 pre-lockdown - and the demand had risen since its partnership with online grocer Ocado ended in August. Waitrose has seen a ""return to the weekly shop"", the John Lewis group said Having struggled to manage competition from online rivals and slower consumer spending, the group has, however, recently announced plans to shut stores. In July, it said it would close eight John Lewis stores, in a move which put 1,300 jobs at risk. And this week it announced it would close four of its Waitrose supermarkets, with the loss of 124 jobs. It also recently said it was reviewing its famous ""never knowingly undersold"" price pledge, which has been in place since 1925. The commitment never applied to sales from internet-only retailers, which have lower costs and often undercut the High Street on price. Looking ahead, Dame Sharon said that the outlook for the second half was ""clearly uncertain"", given the wider coronavirus crisis. She also emphasised that the Christmas trading period would be ""particularly important to profits"" for the group. On Thursday, John Lewis also confirmed that it had opened its Christmas shop early this year. Sales of Christmas trees and baubles were both ""markedly"" up on last year, it said.

"Migrants have been sleeping rough for a week since the Moria blaze Police on the Greek island of Lesbos are moving thousands of migrants and refugees from the fire-gutted Moria camp to a new tent city nearby. Seventy female officers in protective suits were flown in to organise the transfer of women and children to the temporary Kara Tepe camp. On Wednesday four Afghan asylum seekers were charged with starting the fire that destroyed Moria last week. A government official said 1,800 had moved into Kara Tepe by early Thursday. But many migrants and refugees remain reluctant to stay on Lesbos, as Moria was overcrowded and squalid. They hope to go elsewhere in Europe, especially Germany. Many migrants are reluctant to enter a new camp on Lesbos More than 12,000 people fled the Moria blaze and most have been sleeping rough since then, short of food, water and shelter. Officers began waking families early on Thursday to move them to the new camp. Footage from the scene shows female officers dressed in white speaking to the migrants. The migrants are being tested for coronavirus before entering Kara Tepe. Reuters news agency reports that 56 have been found Covid-19 positive, and the authorities are striving to keep those infected isolated.

"The Bank of England has warned that the rising rate of coronavirus infections and a lack of clarity over the UK's future trade relationship with the EU could threaten the economic recovery. It said much of output lost during lockdown had been recovered but the outlook remained ""unusually uncertain"". The UK is still ina deep recession, while Covid-19 infections are at their highest level since mid May. Citing the uncertainty, the Bank held interest rates at 0.1%, a historic low. It added that it would continue its monetary support for the economy, but stopped short of increasing its bond-buying programme or reducing interest rates further. If you borrow money you usually have to pay a small fee set by the person lending to you. How high that fee - or interest rate - is depends on a ""base rate"" that is set by the Bank of England at meetings throughout the year. The rate determines how much banks have to pay to borrow money, and that has a knock-on effect on how much the bank charges consumers to borrow. When the economy is growing quickly the Bank tries to stop it overheating by raising interest rates, making it more expensive to borrow. When the economy is sluggish, cutting the Bank's base rate lowers the cost of borrowing and can encourage businesses and consumers to spend more. The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), which sets interest rate policy, said previous projections of economic recovery were ""on the assumption of an immediate, orderly move to a comprehensive free trade agreement with the European Union on 1 January 2021"". Economic recovery would also depend on the evolution of the pandemic and measures taken to protect public health, the MPC said. ""The recent increases in Covid-19 cases in some parts of the world, including the United Kingdom, have the potential to weigh further on economic activity, albeit probably on a lesser scale than seen earlier in the year,"" it said. No change from the Bank of England on record low interest rates, nor on its wider support for the economy. On the face of it, the economy is less weak than it expected even last month, but profound uncertainties remain. The Bank in particular pointed to ""recent increases in Covid-19"", including in the UK, that ""have the potential to weigh further on economic activity"", as well as a recent fall in sterling partly ""reflecting recent Brexit developments"". Given rates are at rock bottom already, sterling was further hit from the fact that the Bank's deliberations over rates included a presentation over how ""negative interest rates"" might work. The Bank had been concerned of the impact of, in effect, lenders paying borrowers for the health of parts of the banking system. It is, as it has previously signalled, looking at how this could be achieved in practice. Should the uncertainties visible to all materialise in the coming weeks for the UK, that extraordinary and unprecedented tool is being prepared as an option. The government has had to impose new social distancing restrictions across England, asrising caseshave forced many areas into local lockdowns. On Wednesday, the Prime Minister said the governmentwas doing ""everything in our power"" to prevent another nationwide lockdown, which could have ""disastrous"" financial consequences for the UK. The Bank of England said despite a stronger than expected recovery in the last few months, the economy was still about 7% smaller than at the end of last year. Usually if the economy is not growing strongly enough, the Bank of England considers lowering interest rates to encourage firms to invest and savers to spend. However, interest rates are already close to zero after two emergency rate cuts in March. Minutes from this month's meeting show that the MPC discussed the use of negative interest rates to stimulate the economy. Last month, the Bank's governor, Andrew Bailey, appeared to rule that out, though he said negative interest rates remained in the ""tool box"". If interest rates are negative the Bank of England charges for any deposits it holds on behalf of the banks. That encourages banks to lend the money to business rather than deposit it. What are negative interest rates? What exactly is the Bank of England interest rate? The Bank also signalled that it had no intention of raising interest rates until ""significant progress"" had been made in getting inflation back to the Bank's 2% target. It is currently at a five-year low of 0.2%. The Bank said it did not expect inflation to return to target levels for another two years. ""We expect interest rates to be no higher than 0.1% for the next five years,"" said Andrew Wishart, UK economist at Capital Economics.

"A woman takes a photo of her relative during the lockdown in May, when visits were banned Care homes in England will receive extra funding of Â£546m to try to reduce transmission of coronavirus during the winter, the government has announced. The money helps to pay workers full wages when they are self-isolating, and ensures carers only work in one care home, reducing the spread of the virus. The fund was set up in May and has been extended until March 2021. In an interview with the Sun,external, the PM warned family visits to care homes may also need to be restricted. ""I'm afraid it's an incredibly difficult thing, but we are going to have to place some restrictions on people - visitors - being able to go into care homes,"" Boris Johnson said. Care homes in England warned of rise in infections Tackling testing delays 'number one' priority The funding allows for money to be made available to help care workers reduce their use of public transport, and stock up on personal protective equipment, according to Mr Johnson. Health Secretary Matt Hancock told the House of Commons the government would do ""whatever is humanly possible"" to protect care homes ""so they are a place of sanctuary this winter"". In an earlier statement, he said that the extra funding would bring ""peace of mind"" to many in the social care sector. Themost recent figures,externalshow there were 35 homes that were dealing with coronavirus outbreaks - defined as having at least one positive case - during the first week of September. During April, the number of homes with outbreaks was about 20 times that rate. The announcement brings the total funding for infection control measures in care homes in England to more than Â£1.1bn, after the sectorreceived Â£600m in May,external. The devolved nations were each allocated funding for care homes in May totalling Â£113m. This video can not be played Lynn hasn't seen her husband, who has dementia, for six weeks due to care home restrictions The announcement comes asnew coronavirus restrictions are expected to be announced in north-east England, where cases have been on the rise. Later in the Commons, Labour's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth asked Mr Hancock to guarantee care homes ""won't face the same shortages"" of personal protective equipment (PPE) and raised concerns about the ""huge harm"" caused to residents by restrictions on family visits. The health secretary said the government had a plan to ensure care homes can get PPE, which would be set out in its Adult Social Care Winter Plan this week. In July, care homes in England were allowed to reopen again for family visits - as long as local authorities and public health teams said it was safe. There went on to be a similar reopening of homes inScotland,WalesandNorthern Ireland. However, many care homes have not yet fully reopened - including with strict rules over visitors and or banning them completely. In Edinburgh, families have protested about ""cruel"" care home visiting rules Ministers have also promisedto make people in care homes a priority for coronavirus tests- along with the NHS - amid ongoing issues with the UK's testing system. A surge in demand for coronavirus tests has led to local shortages, with many people reporting problems securing online bookings andbeing directed to test sites hundreds of miles from home. The large Lighthouse laboratories, run by the government to analyse test swabs from all the UK nations, have been under strain to process them all. Mr Hancock will announce who will be prioritised for tests in the coming days. What's going wrong with coronavirus testing? How do I get a coronavirus test? His government colleague, health minister Edward Argar, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the official guidance ""will prioritise frontline NHS care workers, teachers and similar"". ""It is possible that there are people with symptoms who apply for a test who have to wait longer because we are prioritising those key frontline workers we need to keep our NHS and care system working,"" he said. There has been a sharp decline in test turnaround speed in England, the latest Test and Trace figures show, with only a third of people (33%) getting their results back within 24 hours of taking a test - down from two-thirds last week.

"Migrants have been sleeping rough for a week since the Moria blaze Police on the Greek island of Lesbos are moving thousands of migrants and refugees from the fire-gutted Moria camp to a new tent city nearby. Seventy female officers in protective suits were flown in to organise the transfer of women and children to the temporary Kara Tepe camp. On Wednesday four Afghan asylum seekers were charged with starting the fire that destroyed Moria last week. A government official said 1,800 had moved into Kara Tepe by early Thursday. But many migrants and refugees remain reluctant to stay on Lesbos, as Moria was overcrowded and squalid. They hope to go elsewhere in Europe, especially Germany. Many migrants are reluctant to enter a new camp on Lesbos More than 12,000 people fled the Moria blaze and most have been sleeping rough since then, short of food, water and shelter. Officers began waking families early on Thursday to move them to the new camp. Footage from the scene shows female officers dressed in white speaking to the migrants.

"The Active Denial System (ADS) uses a microwave beam to make targets feel like their skin is burning Officers requested a ""heat ray"" weapon for possible use against protesters in a park next to the White House in June, a National Guard major has said. Military police allegedly asked the National Guard for the Active Denial System (ADS), which makes targets feel their skin is on fire. It happened before Lafayette Square was cleared of people protesting against the killing of black man George Floyd. The National Guard did not possess the heat ray and it was not used. Law enforcement officers are instead believed to have used tear gas, rubber bullets and smoke grenades to clear the park on 1 June. At the time authorities said it was to tackle violent protesters who had thrown rocks at police and started fires. Reporters at the scene however said the demonstration had been peaceful. Park Police have denied using tear gas, saying that they instead fired ""pepper balls"" - projectiles with capsaicin, the chemical that gives peppers heat - at protesters. How are African-Americans treated under US law? Five pieces of context to understand the US protests Shortly after officers cleared the park, US President Donald Trump walked across the street from the White House for a photo opportunity outside a church. Protesters were cleared moments before Trump came through the square, which drew heavy criticism from both Democrats and Republicans, and Washington DC Mayor Muriel Bowser called it ""shameful"". Attorney General William Barr later said that the claim that protesters were cleared for President Trump's photo opportunity was ""totally false"" and that the decision had been taken the previous evening. National Guard Major Adam DeMarco was at the scene of the protest, serving as a liaison officer in a supervisory role. Inwritten testimony provided to US lawmakers,externalandfirst published by NPR,external, Maj De Marco said a senior military police officer asked if the National Guard in the US capital had the ADS in the morning of 1 June. The heat ray weapon uses a microwave beam to make human skin feel like it is burning. Authorities say it causes no permanent damage. This video can not be played The US's history of racial inequality has paved the way for modern day police brutality In an email which Maj DeMarco was copied into, the senior officer said the ADS ""can immediately compel an individual to cease threatening behavior"", describing the effect of the weapon as ""overwhelming"". Maj DeMarco responded that the DC National Guard did not have the ADS, nor an LRAD - a Long Range Acoustic Device, also requested, which can blast a wall of sound at crowds. Federal officials also began stockpiling ammunition that day, Maj DeMarco said. A US defence department official, speaking to the Washington Post, characterised the emails as ""routine inventory checks"" about available equipment. The department, the army and the National Guard did not respond to specific questions from the newspaper about munitions and their planned use. Maj DeMarco is an Iraq War veteran who ran for Congress as a Democrat in 2018 The major is an Iraq War veteran who has saidhe was ""deeply disturbed"" by the official response. The 34-year-old ran for Congress in 2018 as a Democrat on a platform that was heavily critical of President Trump. According to a New York Times report in August,borders officials proposed using the heat ray to stop migrants,externalat the US southern border in 2018. The system was deployed in Afghanistan by the US military but reportedly was not used operationally. Demonstrators had gathered in the park near the White House for days as part of mass protests against police brutality and racism in the US. Police moved in to clear them at about 18:30 local time (22:30 GMT) - about 30 minutes before a city-wide curfew went into effect - and just as Mr Trump began a televised speech from the White House Rose Garden. After his speech ended, and as the protesters were further pushed back, Mr Trump walked to the nearby St John's Episcopal Church and briefly posed for a photo as he held up a Bible. The basement of the church had been set on fire the previous day. Trump's church visit shocks religious leaders Inside the White House Bible Study group The White House said that the decision to expand the security perimeter was not related to the president's decision to visit the church, where moments earlier protesters had gathered. DC Mayor Muriel Bowser later renamed a plazaoutside the White House - now Black Lives Matter Plaza - as a rebuke to the president. Correction 15th May 2022: An earlier version of this article reported that protesters were cleared from Lafayette Square to make way for President Trump and this has been amended to make clear that this is a claim which was denied by Attorney General William Barr.

"John Lewis has confirmed that staff will not receive a bonus for the first time since 1953 after it was hit by lockdown store closures. The retailer - which also owns Waitrose - posted a huge Â£635m pre-tax loss for the six months to 25 July after higher costs offset a 1% rise in sales. Its chairwoman told staff on Thursday the announcement ""will come as a blow"". Even before Covid-19 hit, the chain had warned it might not pay the usual staff bonus as competition ate into profits. The group's first-half loss was Â£635m once exceptional items were taken into account, including a Â£470m write-down in the value of its stores. Excluding those one-off costs, the group's loss in those six months stood at Â£55m. The last time that the chain, which operates as a partnership, decided not to pay a bonus to its staff was in the aftermath of World War Two. Chairwoman Dame Sharon White said: ""We came through then to be even stronger and we will do so again."" She added: ""I know this will come as a blow to partners who have worked so hard this year. The decision in no way detracts from the commitment and dedication that you have shown."" The payment of bonuses will only resume once annual profits rise to above Â£150m and debt falls, she said. John Lewis to pull 'Never knowingly undersold' pledge Shoppers 'won't let John Lewis go without a fight' The retailer said store closures during lockdown and customers buying less profitable items, such as toilet paper or laptops, had hit trade. It estimated that in its first half, John Lewis shops saw a Â£200m drop in sales, while the wider group saw additional coronavirus-related costs total about Â£50m. But in a statement, it said that its Waitrose supermarkets had seen ""a return to the weekly shop"", with like-for-like sales up 10% year-on-year. John Lewis has had a whopping half-year loss. But it was mainly down to some big one off costs, including a Â£470m impairment charge against the value of its department stores, reflecting the fact that they don't play as big a role as they used to. Stores have a halo effect in boosting online sales. Many shoppers browse before going home and ordering online. Before the crisis, John Lewis thought its department stores helped generate around Â£6 of every Â£10 spent online. John Lewis now thinks that figure is nearer Â£3. Eight John Lewis stores have closed, costing the business another Â£105m. These results lay bare the impact of the pandemic. But the the company says this is better than what it expected in April. John Lewis makes most of its profits in the second half of the year. Christmas is key. With the outcome still very uncertain, it now thinks the most likely outcome is a ""small loss or small profit"" for the full year. Dame Sharon said the pandemic had brought forward changes in consumer shopping habits ""which might have taken five years into five months"". At John Lewis stores, online sales surged by 73% in the six months to 25 July, ""helping to offset the impact of shop closures"". They now account for more than 60% of sales overall for the department store chain, up from 40% before the pandemic hit. The group added that a shift towards increased home working had affected people's purchases, with increased sales of tablets and TVs, while sales of trousers had declined. The chain also said that Waitrose was now delivering about 170,000 weekly food orders - up from 60,000 pre-lockdown - and the demand had risen since its partnership with online grocer Ocado ended in August. Waitrose has seen a ""return to the weekly shop"", the John Lewis group said Having struggled to manage competition from online rivals and slower consumer spending, the group has, however, recently announced plans to shut stores. In July, it said it would close eight John Lewis stores, in a move which put 1,300 jobs at risk. And this week it announced it would close four of its Waitrose supermarkets, with the loss of 124 jobs. It also recently said it was reviewing its famous ""never knowingly undersold"" price pledge, which has been in place since 1925. The commitment never applied to sales from internet-only retailers, which have lower costs and often undercut the High Street on price. Looking ahead, Dame Sharon said that the outlook for the second half was ""clearly uncertain"", given the wider coronavirus crisis. She also emphasised that the Christmas trading period would be ""particularly important to profits"" for the group. On Thursday, John Lewis also confirmed that it had opened its Christmas shop early this year. Sales of Christmas trees and baubles were both ""markedly"" up on last year, it said.

"New Zealand is in its deepest recession in decades, following strict measures in response to the Covid-19 pandemic which were widely praised. The country's GDP shrank by 12.2% between April and June as the lockdown and border closures hit. It is New Zealand's first recession since the global financial crisis and its worst since 1987, when the current system of measurement began. But the government hopes its pandemic response will lead to a quick recovery. The nation of nearly five million was briefly declared virus free, and although it still has a handful of cases, it has only had 25 deaths. The economy is likely to be a key issue in next month's election, which was delayed after an unexpected spike in Covid-19 cases in August. Stats NZ spokesman Paul Pascoe said the measures implemented since 19 March have had a huge impact of some sectors of the economy. ""Industries like retail, accommodation and restaurants, and transport saw significant declines in production because they were most directly affected by the international travel ban and strict nationwide lockdown,"" he said. How did New Zealand become Covid-19 free? Jacinda Ardern delays NZ election over coronavirus fears Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern's government has said the success in suppressing the virus is likely to help recovery prospects. Finance Minister Grant Robertson said the GDP numbers were better than expected, and suggested a strong recovery ahead. ""Going hard and early means that we can come back faster and stronger,"" he said. Some economists are also predicting a swift recovery, because of New Zealand's strong response to the virus. ""We expect the June quarter's record-breaking GDP decline to be followed by a record-breaking rise in the September quarter,"" said Westpac Senior Economist Michael Gordon.

"New Zealand is in its deepest recession in decades, following strict measures in response to the Covid-19 pandemic which were widely praised. The country's GDP shrank by 12.2% between April and June as the lockdown and border closures hit. It is New Zealand's first recession since the global financial crisis and its worst since 1987, when the current system of measurement began. But the government hopes its pandemic response will lead to a quick recovery. The nation of nearly five million was briefly declared virus free, and although it still has a handful of cases, it has only had 25 deaths. The economy is likely to be a key issue in next month's election, which was delayed after an unexpected spike in Covid-19 cases in August. Stats NZ spokesman Paul Pascoe said the measures implemented since 19 March have had a huge impact of some sectors of the economy. ""Industries like retail, accommodation and restaurants, and transport saw significant declines in production because they were most directly affected by the international travel ban and strict nationwide lockdown,"" he said. How did New Zealand become Covid-19 free? Jacinda Ardern delays NZ election over coronavirus fears Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern's government has said the success in suppressing the virus is likely to help recovery prospects. Finance Minister Grant Robertson said the GDP numbers were better than expected, and suggested a strong recovery ahead. ""Going hard and early means that we can come back faster and stronger,"" he said. Some economists are also predicting a swift recovery, because of New Zealand's strong response to the virus. ""We expect the June quarter's record-breaking GDP decline to be followed by a record-breaking rise in the September quarter,"" said Westpac Senior Economist Michael Gordon. Ms Ardern said she backs the economy's ability to rebound. ""I think one of the key questions here is not just about what's happened over that June quarter in terms of the effect of lockdown. It's actually about the rebound - and I back New Zealand's rebound,"" she said.

"'Paul' was accused of committing a domestic burglary in June 2018. In early 2019 he was told by police that no further action would be taken against him. However, he was subsequently charged. Last week - over two years since the alleged offence - he appeared at Inner London Crown Court. But his barrister told the court that the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) had still not served the sole evidence - DNA - in the case on the defence. Paul (not his real name) is on bail and had his trial put on provisional ""warned"" list - for December 2021. It means there is no guarantee it will take place at that time - just that it might. The judge explained apologetically that priority is being given to cases where defendants are being held in custody. So, three and a half-years from the date of the alleged offence, there has been no justice for the alleged burglary victim - or the accused. Paul's was one of a number of cases I saw on a visit to Inner London with the chair of the Criminal Bar Association (CBA) James Mulholland QC. He told me it was typical. ""This is justice 2020, but it has been like this for the last 10 years, delay after delay, inbuilt into the system. These cases are being pushed back continuously. ""Lack of investment is at the heart of it and government needs to understand that you don't create a proper justice system without proper investment. ""What we are seeing here are the fruits of a lack of interest."" That apparent ""lack of interest"" is reflected in the state of some court buildings. Outside Inner London I saw a dead pigeon decaying on netting, vast weeds growing up the side of the building and old pipes leaking water. Meanwhile, a court official told me that some court centres are now listing trials for 2023. The delays are caused by a range of factors. Lawyers point to huge cuts to the police, CPS and other agencies such as probation. There are a range of things malfunctioning within the system. They include long initial delays caused by police ""releasing suspects under investigation"" - sometimes for years - before a charging decision is made. Systemic problems continue with the CPS serving evidence late on the defence, meaning lawyers cannot advise their clients in a timely manner. And perhaps most significantly - the decisions by government to cut thousands of crown court sitting days. That has meant that courts have been mothballed while trials stack up in a growing backlog. None of these problems are caused by the coronavirus pandemic and lockdown, but they are of course exacerbated by it. Pre-lockdown the crown court backlog in England and Wales stood at some 37,000. It is now over 46,000. James Mulholland QC says lengthy waits are typical ""Adam"" - not his real name - was accused of rape in March 2018. He denies the charge. His trial has been put back twice, once because of the pandemic. He is now on a ""warned"" list for November, while his chosen career in one of the public services is on hold. ""I have suffered really bad with my mental health through it,"" he says. ""I've had to up my dosage of anti-depressants. It's affected my potential career. ""The hard work I have done at university and everything to get me there it's all basically going out of the window now. I haven't got any trust or hope that it will be anywhere near the end of this year. ""I think it will be more like April next year."" The next case I saw involved two young men charged with possession of drugs with intent to supply.  The alleged offence took place in December 2017. No one in court could explain the delay. It was followed by a case in which the judge needed a pre-sentence report from the probation service in order to sentence the defendant. Despite repeated requests, no one was available. In order to achieve a conclusion of the case, the judge had to devise a sentence which did not require a report.  It was not ideal, but it showed professionals trying to do their best in the face of a lack of resources. Emma Fenn, a barrister specialising in criminal work, paints a bleak picture. ""Defendants are suspended from their jobs with trial dates one to two years away. Some are losing university places with dates from the alleged offence to trial of four years. ""And some who are awaiting trial for 18-24 months on bail, can be on electronic tagged curfew from 7-7 every day, for up to two years."" To help deal with the situation, the government has announced that the period of time an accused person can be held before a trial - known as the Custody Time Limit (CTL) - will be increased from six to eight months. But the government admitted - in response to a Freedom of Information request from the group Fair Trials - that it did not know how many people had been held in prison beyond the time limit since lockdown. Lawyers fear some accused will spend more time in custody awaiting trial than the sentence they would eventually receive if they pleaded guilty - and that some might falsely plead guilty simply to bring an end to their case. 'Please don't forget us': Virus adds to court backlog Locations of 10 temporary courts revealed Covid court plan will not ease delays, lawyers say Life is bleak for those in custody awaiting trial, says Ms Fenn, ""There are often no visits from family or in-person visits from lawyers. Defendants can be locked up for 23.5 hours a day, education classes and courses are suspended, jobs within the prison restricted, and there are reports of showers being limited to 1-2 a week."" Covid has also removed a ""huge amount of mental health, drug and alcohol agency support"", she says. A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said justice had been kept moving ""despite the unprecedented challenges posed by the pandemic"" and overall, cases are falling. However, they acknowledged that ""more needs to be done"". The government has launched an Â£80 million CriminalCourts Recovery plan,externalwhich includes: Employing 1,600 court staff to support recovery measures Introducing plexiglass screens to separate members of the jury to enable safe use of more court rooms Magistrate courts are seeing the number of outstanding cases drop - dealing with over 21,000 cases a week. Increasing capacity through ""Nightingale Courts"" - 10 are up and running, a further eight planned to open shortly Exploring new extended court 'COVID operating hours' However, only three of the new Nightingale Courts are dealing with crime. I visited one, Prospero House, a short walk from Inner London. It is a state of the art commercial building with three large courtrooms allowing ample room for social distancing.  Every desk has hand sanitiser and protective gloves. But Mr Mulholland says: ""We need 60 criminal Nightingale Court buildings. At the moment we have just three."" The CBA says there are around 460 crown courtrooms in England and Wales. Currently around 100 are able to hear trials, though not all are hosting them. The government says its plan will bring on stream another 250 of the existing rooms to hear jury trials by the end of October. The CBA believes that simply will not cut into the backlog. Lawyers believe that the Treasury has long seen justice as a poor relation to health and education in terms of public spending. ""Investing in the criminal justice system is investing in the wealth and prosperity of the country,"" says Mr Mulholland. ""It is an empty and insulting promise for any minister to declare a war on crime if a government can't fund a system that keeps us safe - and ensures crimes are swiftly investigated and cases come to court on time.""

"Northumberland, Newcastle, Sunderland, North and South Tyneside, Gateshead and County Durham council areas affected Households banned from mixing and pubs must close between 22:00 and 05:00 Guidance says only essential visits to care homes and hospitals allowed, and people must not go on holiday with other households Comes after a spike in coronavirus with 1,106 new cases in a seven-day period Matt Hancock tells Parliament of a ""concerning rise"" in positive tests Newcastle City Council leader Nick Forbes hopes temporary move will prevent ""full lockdown"" Duncan Leatherdale Explore the data on how the coronavirus pandemic unfolded in the UK. Most people in England and Scotland no longer get free PCRs or LFTs, and rules vary across the rest of the UK. What are the new Covid symptoms, and when should I stay at home? If scientists succeed in making a coronavirus vaccine, when will we get it, how much will it cost and who will get it first? The number of under-17s seeking Covid-19 tests has doubled, the head of NHS Test and Trace tells MPs. That's the end of our live coverage for today as nearly two million people across the North East will seestricter coronavirus restrictions from midnight after a spike in cases. Here's some of the key points:  We'll have more tomorrow from 08:00. If you're affected by these changes and you want to get in touch, or if you have any questions you cantweet us,external, contact us via ourFacebook page,externaloremail us. Take care.  Among the many questions Newcastle City Council has endeavoured to answer today is what to do if people see others breaking the rules. ""Where people
are breaking the rules, we will seek to engage, explain and encourage them to
adhere to the restrictions,"" the council said, adding: ""However, enforcement action will be taken where
appropriate."" It suggests people should report breaches to the police, while concerns about businesses can be sent to the seven councils in the affected areas. ""Once the
legislation is in place, the police or the local authority will be able to take
action against those who break these rules, including asking people to disperse
and issuing fixed penalty notices starting at Â£100 for those who participate in
illegal gatherings,"" a council spokesman said. People aged
18 or over could be fined Â£100 for the first offence, lowered to Â£50 if paid within
14 days, and Â£200 for the second offence, then doubling for each
further offence up to a maximum of Â£3,200. A heavily-pregnant woman has told of the ""misery"" of trying to get a coronavirus test for her ill daughter. Verity Ward from South Shields booked for her three-year-old daughter Romilly to be tested at Doxford Park in Sunderland at 13:30 today after the youngster became ill overnight. Ms Ward is 38 weeks pregnant and due to have a Caesarean operation in the next few days so needs to know if the virus has infected her household. But she and her partner got stuck in a queue on the A19 which had backed up from the testing centre. ""We saw some police cars go up past us, and then eventually a man came down and told each car that the computers at the centre had crashed and they weren't going to be able to do any tests,"" she said. ""As we did a three-point-turn to leave, we saw police stopping other cars from joining the queue so at least those people didn't have to endure the misery. ""As for us, I guess we try again tomorrow. I've got a lot of hospital appointments coming up and I really can't be doing 14 days isolation. I want to know if I'm safe."" Measures to stop households mixing and early pub closures will come into effect from midnight. Eugene Milne, the director of public health in Newcastle, said the seven local authorities are awaiting the final regulations from the government. He said: ""That requires the Department of Health lawyers to comb over them and make sure there is a clear line about which parts are under law and which are advice. I'm hoping we will have those this afternoon. ""This is a very fast moving situation and we would like to get that clarity out to everybody."" He said the government had ""in the main"" granted what the councils had asked for and it was about ""treading a line"" between maintaining enough of the economy that can run within guidance [which] at the same time addresses the problems we have seen"". ""It is the balance of keeping things going as much as we can while controlling the virus, we don't want to flip-flop between lockdown and rapid viral spread on the other hand."" The measures affect seven council areas and come into force from midnight on Thursday. More than 100 people are currently waiting in cars at an empty Sunderland car park, where they say they have been booked in for coronavirus testing. People are arriving at the site, but no staff or equipment are there. Drivers are arriving with print outs of their appointments but no Covid-19 testing is available.

The area covering seven North East councils isnot the first to have local measures put in place: BBC Newcastle Residents of the seven affected North East areas are being advised not to visit people outside of those places, Newcastle's director of public health said. Asked if people could make such visits, Eugene Milne said: ""Again we would advise against that. The restrictions we asked for is for people to be able to travel outside the area but not to meet with people from other households. ""This is about he spread of the virus. We know already with some of the spread we have seen in the region it's happened because of that type of mixing. We want to put a lid on that and get the spread under a manageable level.""  Here are some questions and answers from Newcastle City Council: Can I have someone in my house or go
into someoneâs houseto do repairs or other work? Official tradespeople can go to other peopleâs
homes for work as long as they follow guidance on how to work
safely. Can I still go on holiday? You can still
go on holiday in the UK or abroad, but you should only do this with people
you live with or have a support bubble with. You need to follow rules in the area you visit and be aware of the self-isolation laws when
travelling to and from certain countries. People can
visit the region on holiday but must comply with the local restrictions. What about public transport and car
sharing? Residents are
advised to only use public transport for essential purposes, such as travelling
to school or work. Face
coverings must be worn unless exempt. You are
advised not to share a car with those outside your household or support bubble,
and to use public transport for essential journeys instead. Are the airport, train stations and
ports still open? Newcastle
Airport, train stations and ports remain open and members of the public are
permitted to travel to and from them. Can I move home? Yes It is âquite hard to give you an accurate figureâ on demand for virus tests, says Test and Trace boss. Francesca WilliamsBBC News Within minutes of the new coronavirus restrictions for the North East being published - and even before then - there were questions. Real life doesn't fit neatly into a set of general guidelines and among the many clarifications people were seeking was whether grandparents could carry on looking after children while parents went to work.  The government said no, but Newcastle City Council said it had been lobbying for them to be excluded from the ban on mixing outside a household or support bubble. The discussions, we're told, are still continuing between local and central government on this one. And none of this is made easier by the fact that the government version of what the rules will be is already circulating on social media, while the council's leader insists the official regulations haven't been published yet. Another problem area identified as causing an increase in coronavirus cases is amateur sport. Here are Newcastle City's Council's answers to some of your questions:. What are the changes to playing
sports? Unless
formally organised by a club or organisation, with guidance
issued by a governing body, team sports should not take place anywhere with people who you donât live with. You should
not watch any sports, including professional and
semi-professional events. Can I travel to play sport outside of
the areas with restrictions? Yes, and a face mask should be worn on public transport unless exempt. Can I go to the gym, class or a
swimming pool? Yes, as long
as these venues have the required guidelines
in place. The cancellation follows the announcement of tighter restrictions in the North East. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Negative,0.008053599
"The Active Denial System (ADS) uses a microwave beam to make targets feel like their skin is burning Officers requested a ""heat ray"" weapon for possible use against protesters in a park next to the White House in June, a National Guard major has said. Military police allegedly asked the National Guard for the Active Denial System (ADS), which makes targets feel their skin is on fire. It happened before Lafayette Square was cleared of people protesting against the killing of black man George Floyd. The National Guard did not possess the heat ray and it was not used. Law enforcement officers are instead believed to have used tear gas, rubber bullets and smoke grenades to clear the park on 1 June. At the time authorities said it was to tackle violent protesters who had thrown rocks at police and started fires. Reporters at the scene however said the demonstration had been peaceful. Park Police have denied using tear gas, saying that they instead fired ""pepper balls"" - projectiles with capsaicin, the chemical that gives peppers heat - at protesters. How are African-Americans treated under US law? Five pieces of context to understand the US protests Shortly after officers cleared the park, US President Donald Trump walked across the street from the White House for a photo opportunity outside a church. Protesters were cleared moments before Trump came through the square, which drew heavy criticism from both Democrats and Republicans, and Washington DC Mayor Muriel Bowser called it ""shameful"". Attorney General William Barr later said that the claim that protesters were cleared for President Trump's photo opportunity was ""totally false"" and that the decision had been taken the previous evening. National Guard Major Adam DeMarco was at the scene of the protest, serving as a liaison officer in a supervisory role. Inwritten testimony provided to US lawmakers,externalandfirst published by NPR,external, Maj De Marco said a senior military police officer asked if the National Guard in the US capital had the ADS in the morning of 1 June.

This video can not be played The US's history of racial inequality has paved the way for modern day police brutality In an email which Maj DeMarco was copied into, the senior officer said the ADS ""can immediately compel an individual to cease threatening behavior"", describing the effect of the weapon as ""overwhelming"". Maj DeMarco responded that the DC National Guard did not have the ADS, nor an LRAD - a Long Range Acoustic Device, also requested, which can blast a wall of sound at crowds. Federal officials also began stockpiling ammunition that day, Maj DeMarco said.

According to a New York Times report in August,borders officials proposed using the heat ray to stop migrants,externalat the US southern border in 2018. The system was deployed in Afghanistan by the US military but reportedly was not used operationally. Demonstrators had gathered in the park near the White House for days as part of mass protests against police brutality and racism in the US. Police moved in to clear them at about 18:30 local time (22:30 GMT) - about 30 minutes before a city-wide curfew went into effect - and just as Mr Trump began a televised speech from the White House Rose Garden. After his speech ended, and as the protesters were further pushed back, Mr Trump walked to the nearby St John's Episcopal Church and briefly posed for a photo as he held up a Bible. The basement of the church had been set on fire the previous day. Trump's church visit shocks religious leaders Inside the White House Bible Study group The White House said that the decision to expand the security perimeter was not related to the president's decision to visit the church, where moments earlier protesters had gathered.

"The Active Denial System (ADS) uses a microwave beam to make targets feel like their skin is burning Officers requested a ""heat ray"" weapon for possible use against protesters in a park next to the White House in June, a National Guard major has said. Military police allegedly asked the National Guard for the Active Denial System (ADS), which makes targets feel their skin is on fire. It happened before Lafayette Square was cleared of people protesting against the killing of black man George Floyd. The National Guard did not possess the heat ray and it was not used. Law enforcement officers are instead believed to have used tear gas, rubber bullets and smoke grenades to clear the park on 1 June. At the time authorities said it was to tackle violent protesters who had thrown rocks at police and started fires. Reporters at the scene however said the demonstration had been peaceful. Park Police have denied using tear gas, saying that they instead fired ""pepper balls"" - projectiles with capsaicin, the chemical that gives peppers heat - at protesters. How are African-Americans treated under US law? Five pieces of context to understand the US protests Shortly after officers cleared the park, US President Donald Trump walked across the street from the White House for a photo opportunity outside a church. Protesters were cleared moments before Trump came through the square, which drew heavy criticism from both Democrats and Republicans, and Washington DC Mayor Muriel Bowser called it ""shameful"". Attorney General William Barr later said that the claim that protesters were cleared for President Trump's photo opportunity was ""totally false"" and that the decision had been taken the previous evening. National Guard Major Adam DeMarco was at the scene of the protest, serving as a liaison officer in a supervisory role. Inwritten testimony provided to US lawmakers,externalandfirst published by NPR,external, Maj De Marco said a senior military police officer asked if the National Guard in the US capital had the ADS in the morning of 1 June. The heat ray weapon uses a microwave beam to make human skin feel like it is burning. Authorities say it causes no permanent damage. This video can not be played The US's history of racial inequality has paved the way for modern day police brutality In an email which Maj DeMarco was copied into, the senior officer said the ADS ""can immediately compel an individual to cease threatening behavior"", describing the effect of the weapon as ""overwhelming"". Maj DeMarco responded that the DC National Guard did not have the ADS, nor an LRAD - a Long Range Acoustic Device, also requested, which can blast a wall of sound at crowds. Federal officials also began stockpiling ammunition that day, Maj DeMarco said. A US defence department official, speaking to the Washington Post, characterised the emails as ""routine inventory checks"" about available equipment. The department, the army and the National Guard did not respond to specific questions from the newspaper about munitions and their planned use. Maj DeMarco is an Iraq War veteran who ran for Congress as a Democrat in 2018 The major is an Iraq War veteran who has saidhe was ""deeply disturbed"" by the official response. The 34-year-old ran for Congress in 2018 as a Democrat on a platform that was heavily critical of President Trump. According to a New York Times report in August,borders officials proposed using the heat ray to stop migrants,externalat the US southern border in 2018. The system was deployed in Afghanistan by the US military but reportedly was not used operationally. Demonstrators had gathered in the park near the White House for days as part of mass protests against police brutality and racism in the US.

"Northumberland, Newcastle, Sunderland, North and South Tyneside, Gateshead and County Durham council areas affected Households banned from mixing and pubs must close between 22:00 and 05:00 Guidance says only essential visits to care homes and hospitals allowed, and people must not go on holiday with other households Comes after a spike in coronavirus with 1,106 new cases in a seven-day period Matt Hancock tells Parliament of a ""concerning rise"" in positive tests Newcastle City Council leader Nick Forbes hopes temporary move will prevent ""full lockdown"" Duncan Leatherdale Explore the data on how the coronavirus pandemic unfolded in the UK. Most people in England and Scotland no longer get free PCRs or LFTs, and rules vary across the rest of the UK. What are the new Covid symptoms, and when should I stay at home? If scientists succeed in making a coronavirus vaccine, when will we get it, how much will it cost and who will get it first? The number of under-17s seeking Covid-19 tests has doubled, the head of NHS Test and Trace tells MPs. That's the end of our live coverage for today as nearly two million people across the North East will seestricter coronavirus restrictions from midnight after a spike in cases. Here's some of the key points:  We'll have more tomorrow from 08:00. If you're affected by these changes and you want to get in touch, or if you have any questions you cantweet us,external, contact us via ourFacebook page,externaloremail us. Take care.  Among the many questions Newcastle City Council has endeavoured to answer today is what to do if people see others breaking the rules. ""Where people
are breaking the rules, we will seek to engage, explain and encourage them to
adhere to the restrictions,"" the council said, adding: ""However, enforcement action will be taken where
appropriate."" It suggests people should report breaches to the police, while concerns about businesses can be sent to the seven councils in the affected areas. ""Once the
legislation is in place, the police or the local authority will be able to take
action against those who break these rules, including asking people to disperse
and issuing fixed penalty notices starting at Â£100 for those who participate in
illegal gatherings,"" a council spokesman said. People aged
18 or over could be fined Â£100 for the first offence, lowered to Â£50 if paid within
14 days, and Â£200 for the second offence, then doubling for each
further offence up to a maximum of Â£3,200. A heavily-pregnant woman has told of the ""misery"" of trying to get a coronavirus test for her ill daughter. Verity Ward from South Shields booked for her three-year-old daughter Romilly to be tested at Doxford Park in Sunderland at 13:30 today after the youngster became ill overnight. Ms Ward is 38 weeks pregnant and due to have a Caesarean operation in the next few days so needs to know if the virus has infected her household. But she and her partner got stuck in a queue on the A19 which had backed up from the testing centre. ""We saw some police cars go up past us, and then eventually a man came down and told each car that the computers at the centre had crashed and they weren't going to be able to do any tests,"" she said. ""As we did a three-point-turn to leave, we saw police stopping other cars from joining the queue so at least those people didn't have to endure the misery. ""As for us, I guess we try again tomorrow. I've got a lot of hospital appointments coming up and I really can't be doing 14 days isolation. I want to know if I'm safe."" Measures to stop households mixing and early pub closures will come into effect from midnight. Eugene Milne, the director of public health in Newcastle, said the seven local authorities are awaiting the final regulations from the government. He said: ""That requires the Department of Health lawyers to comb over them and make sure there is a clear line about which parts are under law and which are advice. I'm hoping we will have those this afternoon. ""This is a very fast moving situation and we would like to get that clarity out to everybody."" He said the government had ""in the main"" granted what the councils had asked for and it was about ""treading a line"" between maintaining enough of the economy that can run within guidance [which] at the same time addresses the problems we have seen"". ""It is the balance of keeping things going as much as we can while controlling the virus, we don't want to flip-flop between lockdown and rapid viral spread on the other hand."" The measures affect seven council areas and come into force from midnight on Thursday. More than 100 people are currently waiting in cars at an empty Sunderland car park, where they say they have been booked in for coronavirus testing. People are arriving at the site, but no staff or equipment are there. Drivers are arriving with print outs of their appointments but no Covid-19 testing is available.

The area covering seven North East councils isnot the first to have local measures put in place: BBC Newcastle Residents of the seven affected North East areas are being advised not to visit people outside of those places, Newcastle's director of public health said. Asked if people could make such visits, Eugene Milne said: ""Again we would advise against that. The restrictions we asked for is for people to be able to travel outside the area but not to meet with people from other households. ""This is about he spread of the virus. We know already with some of the spread we have seen in the region it's happened because of that type of mixing. We want to put a lid on that and get the spread under a manageable level.""  Here are some questions and answers from Newcastle City Council: Can I have someone in my house or go
into someoneâs houseto do repairs or other work? Official tradespeople can go to other peopleâs
homes for work as long as they follow guidance on how to work
safely. Can I still go on holiday? You can still
go on holiday in the UK or abroad, but you should only do this with people
you live with or have a support bubble with. You need to follow rules in the area you visit and be aware of the self-isolation laws when
travelling to and from certain countries. People can
visit the region on holiday but must comply with the local restrictions. What about public transport and car
sharing? Residents are
advised to only use public transport for essential purposes, such as travelling
to school or work. Face
coverings must be worn unless exempt. You are
advised not to share a car with those outside your household or support bubble,
and to use public transport for essential journeys instead. Are the airport, train stations and
ports still open? Newcastle
Airport, train stations and ports remain open and members of the public are
permitted to travel to and from them. Can I move home? Yes It is âquite hard to give you an accurate figureâ on demand for virus tests, says Test and Trace boss. Francesca WilliamsBBC News Within minutes of the new coronavirus restrictions for the North East being published - and even before then - there were questions. Real life doesn't fit neatly into a set of general guidelines and among the many clarifications people were seeking was whether grandparents could carry on looking after children while parents went to work.  The government said no, but Newcastle City Council said it had been lobbying for them to be excluded from the ban on mixing outside a household or support bubble. The discussions, we're told, are still continuing between local and central government on this one. And none of this is made easier by the fact that the government version of what the rules will be is already circulating on social media, while the council's leader insists the official regulations haven't been published yet. Another problem area identified as causing an increase in coronavirus cases is amateur sport. Here are Newcastle City's Council's answers to some of your questions:. What are the changes to playing
sports? Unless
formally organised by a club or organisation, with guidance
issued by a governing body, team sports should not take place anywhere with people who you donât live with. You should
not watch any sports, including professional and
semi-professional events. Can I travel to play sport outside of
the areas with restrictions? Yes, and a face mask should be worn on public transport unless exempt. Can I go to the gym, class or a
swimming pool? Yes, as long
as these venues have the required guidelines
in place. The cancellation follows the announcement of tighter restrictions in the North East. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Negative,3.8499513e-07
"Ex-Transport Secretary Chris Grayling has landed a Â£100,000 job advising the owner of some of the UK's top ports. The Conservative MP is working for Hutchison Ports, which operates Harwich and Felixstowe among other terminals. According to the MPs' register of financial interests,external, he will be paid for seven hours work a week for a year. The appointment has been approved by a Whitehall watchdog despite it raising concerns of a ""perceived risk"" that it may give the firm an unfair advantage. The Advisory Committee on Business Appointments,external(ACOBA) said Mr Grayling had reassured them he would not be advising the company on its commercial maritime activities or risks and opportunities associated with Brexit. The watchdog said the role would be limited to advising the firm, which also operates London Thamesport, on its environmental strategy and its engagement with local enterprise bodies. It said the MP must comply with these and other conditions, including a ban on him lobbying ministers on behalf of the company or giving advice on UK government tenders, until July 2021, two years after he left the cabinet. Mr Grayling stepped down as transport secretary when Boris Johnson became PM in July 2019, having served under his predecessor Theresa May for three years. MPs are allowed to take on second jobs - and while some have argued that representing constituents should be a full-time occupation, others say working in ""the real world"" keeps members of Parliament grounded in reality. For ex-members of the government, however, taking on paid work is slightly trickier - particularly if they have only recently given up their ministerial red boxes. There are rules on appointments set by the government, with compliance overseen by ACOBA. Former ministers and ex-senior civil servants are are expected to seek advice from the watchdog and follow its advice if they want to start a job less than two years after leaving government. However although the watchdog has the power to put information about appointments into the public domain, it has no formal enforcement powers. In 2017, a committee of MPs described ACOBA as ""a toothless regulator"". And in the same year, Labour's then shadow cabinet office minister Jon Trickett said it was ""populated with establishment figures"". Why has Javid been allowed to work for JP Morgan? Critics of Mr Grayling say he made a series of poor decisions during his time in the job, including awarding a contract to a group of ferry operators to provide extra capacity after the UK left the EU - one of which had never sailed a vessel. The contracts,which Mr Grayling described as an insurance policy, were later cancelled. The National Audit Office estimated that the costs incurred to the taxpayer could be as high as Â£56.6m. Mr Johnson sought to install the MP for Epsom and Ewell as chair of the powerful Commons Intelligence and Security Committee in July. But MPs on the committee voted to back his colleague Julian Lewis instead. Mr Grayling has since quit the committee.

"Staff working from home for fashion retailer Next have been ""stultified"" by boring online presentations and missed out on office camaraderie, the company said. Next said that overall, the impact of the pandemic on business had been ""expensive and miserable"". But it had also seen some advantages from the upheaval, it added. Next said it expected some home working to continue and that the balance would ""evolve over time"". Along with all ""non-essential"" retailers, Next was forced to close its doors when the pandemic struck. But it continued to meet online orders after overhauling work practices at its warehouses to allow for social distancing. Announcing its financial results for the first six months of the year, including a 34% drop in sales over the worst of the lockdown, the fashion chain said some good had come from the experience. 'Nine in 10 would continue working from home' The ironing-board desk and other WFH inventions Bad backs and wobbly tables: 'I hate working from home' ""It is remarkable what can be learnt from shutting down your entire operation and slowly, department by department, store by store, warehouse by warehouse, bringing it back to life,"" Next said in a statement. Warehouses and call centres had become more efficient, while staff in other areas had been forced to make more of new technology, it said. However, it said having staff ""sitting in their spare bedrooms, kitchens and conservatories"" had had pros and cons. Video calls for large groups had proved ""unwieldy, frustrating and inefficient"". ""Worst of all, perhaps, large video calls have encouraged the proliferation of one of the business world's most damaging practices - death by deck,"" it said. Explaining further, it said this meant ""slideshow presentations that transform meetings from productive exchanges of ideas into boring, one-way lectures, with the 'presenters' rattling through bullet points already visible to their stultified audience"". Online sales held up during lockdown, with childrens' wear and sportswear performing strongly Next said the biggest problem with home working was the lack of spontaneous conversations and the chance to learn from colleagues. On the other hand, it had allowed people to focus more effectively on some solitary tasks, including systems coding and product design. Next said that had empowered individuals and been liberating. Millions of UK workers switched to working partly or completely from home when the country went into lockdown in March. Many welcomed the break from the daily commute and office politics, but the government is keen to encourage workers back into the office to revive city centres. Firms have taken a mixed approach. Some, such as Twitter, say employees might continue to work from home even after the threat from the virus subsides. Netflix boss Reed Hastings, however, wants staff to return to the office ""12 hours after a vaccine is approved"". Next's 34% fall in sales saw wedding outfits and work clothes particularly badly hit. However, it said the business had been ""more resilient than we expected"", with pre-tax profit totalling Â£9m for the first half of the year. It said it was fortunate that half of its revenues were already coming from online sales before the onset of the pandemic. It has revised its profit forecast for the full year from Â£195m to Â£300m. But it said that current rules to limit the spread of the virus, including the ""rule of six"", would depress demands for gifts and clothing, if still in force in December.

"A woman takes a photo of her relative during the lockdown in May, when visits were banned Care homes in England will receive extra funding of Â£546m to try to reduce transmission of coronavirus during the winter, the government has announced. The money helps to pay workers full wages when they are self-isolating, and ensures carers only work in one care home, reducing the spread of the virus. The fund was set up in May and has been extended until March 2021. In an interview with the Sun,external, the PM warned family visits to care homes may also need to be restricted. ""I'm afraid it's an incredibly difficult thing, but we are going to have to place some restrictions on people - visitors - being able to go into care homes,"" Boris Johnson said. Care homes in England warned of rise in infections Tackling testing delays 'number one' priority The funding allows for money to be made available to help care workers reduce their use of public transport, and stock up on personal protective equipment, according to Mr Johnson. Health Secretary Matt Hancock told the House of Commons the government would do ""whatever is humanly possible"" to protect care homes ""so they are a place of sanctuary this winter"". In an earlier statement, he said that the extra funding would bring ""peace of mind"" to many in the social care sector. Themost recent figures,externalshow there were 35 homes that were dealing with coronavirus outbreaks - defined as having at least one positive case - during the first week of September. During April, the number of homes with outbreaks was about 20 times that rate. The announcement brings the total funding for infection control measures in care homes in England to more than Â£1.1bn, after the sectorreceived Â£600m in May,external. The devolved nations were each allocated funding for care homes in May totalling Â£113m. This video can not be played Lynn hasn't seen her husband, who has dementia, for six weeks due to care home restrictions The announcement comes asnew coronavirus restrictions are expected to be announced in north-east England, where cases have been on the rise. Later in the Commons, Labour's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth asked Mr Hancock to guarantee care homes ""won't face the same shortages"" of personal protective equipment (PPE) and raised concerns about the ""huge harm"" caused to residents by restrictions on family visits. The health secretary said the government had a plan to ensure care homes can get PPE, which would be set out in its Adult Social Care Winter Plan this week. In July, care homes in England were allowed to reopen again for family visits - as long as local authorities and public health teams said it was safe. There went on to be a similar reopening of homes inScotland,WalesandNorthern Ireland. However, many care homes have not yet fully reopened - including with strict rules over visitors and or banning them completely. In Edinburgh, families have protested about ""cruel"" care home visiting rules Ministers have also promisedto make people in care homes a priority for coronavirus tests- along with the NHS - amid ongoing issues with the UK's testing system. A surge in demand for coronavirus tests has led to local shortages, with many people reporting problems securing online bookings andbeing directed to test sites hundreds of miles from home. The large Lighthouse laboratories, run by the government to analyse test swabs from all the UK nations, have been under strain to process them all. Mr Hancock will announce who will be prioritised for tests in the coming days. What's going wrong with coronavirus testing? How do I get a coronavirus test? His government colleague, health minister Edward Argar, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the official guidance ""will prioritise frontline NHS care workers, teachers and similar"". ""It is possible that there are people with symptoms who apply for a test who have to wait longer because we are prioritising those key frontline workers we need to keep our NHS and care system working,"" he said. There has been a sharp decline in test turnaround speed in England, the latest Test and Trace figures show, with only a third of people (33%) getting their results back within 24 hours of taking a test - down from two-thirds last week. A total of 18,371 new people tested positive for coronavirus in England in the week to 9 September. SUPPORT BUBBLES:What are they and who can be in yours?

Coronavirus swept through UK care homes during the peak of the outbreak, withtens of thousands of deaths. Almost 30,000 more care home residents in England and Wales died during the coronavirus outbreak than during the same period in 2019, Office for National Statistics figures published in July show.

"John Lewis has confirmed that staff will not receive a bonus for the first time since 1953 after it was hit by lockdown store closures. The retailer - which also owns Waitrose - posted a huge Â£635m pre-tax loss for the six months to 25 July after higher costs offset a 1% rise in sales. Its chairwoman told staff on Thursday the announcement ""will come as a blow"". Even before Covid-19 hit, the chain had warned it might not pay the usual staff bonus as competition ate into profits. The group's first-half loss was Â£635m once exceptional items were taken into account, including a Â£470m write-down in the value of its stores. Excluding those one-off costs, the group's loss in those six months stood at Â£55m. The last time that the chain, which operates as a partnership, decided not to pay a bonus to its staff was in the aftermath of World War Two. Chairwoman Dame Sharon White said: ""We came through then to be even stronger and we will do so again."" She added: ""I know this will come as a blow to partners who have worked so hard this year. The decision in no way detracts from the commitment and dedication that you have shown."" The payment of bonuses will only resume once annual profits rise to above Â£150m and debt falls, she said. John Lewis to pull 'Never knowingly undersold' pledge Shoppers 'won't let John Lewis go without a fight' The retailer said store closures during lockdown and customers buying less profitable items, such as toilet paper or laptops, had hit trade. It estimated that in its first half, John Lewis shops saw a Â£200m drop in sales, while the wider group saw additional coronavirus-related costs total about Â£50m. But in a statement, it said that its Waitrose supermarkets had seen ""a return to the weekly shop"", with like-for-like sales up 10% year-on-year. John Lewis has had a whopping half-year loss. But it was mainly down to some big one off costs, including a Â£470m impairment charge against the value of its department stores, reflecting the fact that they don't play as big a role as they used to. Stores have a halo effect in boosting online sales. Many shoppers browse before going home and ordering online. Before the crisis, John Lewis thought its department stores helped generate around Â£6 of every Â£10 spent online. John Lewis now thinks that figure is nearer Â£3. Eight John Lewis stores have closed, costing the business another Â£105m. These results lay bare the impact of the pandemic. But the the company says this is better than what it expected in April. John Lewis makes most of its profits in the second half of the year. Christmas is key. With the outcome still very uncertain, it now thinks the most likely outcome is a ""small loss or small profit"" for the full year. Dame Sharon said the pandemic had brought forward changes in consumer shopping habits ""which might have taken five years into five months"". At John Lewis stores, online sales surged by 73% in the six months to 25 July, ""helping to offset the impact of shop closures"". They now account for more than 60% of sales overall for the department store chain, up from 40% before the pandemic hit. The group added that a shift towards increased home working had affected people's purchases, with increased sales of tablets and TVs, while sales of trousers had declined. The chain also said that Waitrose was now delivering about 170,000 weekly food orders - up from 60,000 pre-lockdown - and the demand had risen since its partnership with online grocer Ocado ended in August. Waitrose has seen a ""return to the weekly shop"", the John Lewis group said Having struggled to manage competition from online rivals and slower consumer spending, the group has, however, recently announced plans to shut stores. In July, it said it would close eight John Lewis stores, in a move which put 1,300 jobs at risk. And this week it announced it would close four of its Waitrose supermarkets, with the loss of 124 jobs. It also recently said it was reviewing its famous ""never knowingly undersold"" price pledge, which has been in place since 1925. The commitment never applied to sales from internet-only retailers, which have lower costs and often undercut the High Street on price. Looking ahead, Dame Sharon said that the outlook for the second half was ""clearly uncertain"", given the wider coronavirus crisis. She also emphasised that the Christmas trading period would be ""particularly important to profits"" for the group. On Thursday, John Lewis also confirmed that it had opened its Christmas shop early this year. Sales of Christmas trees and baubles were both ""markedly"" up on last year, it said.

"Northumberland, Newcastle, Sunderland, North and South Tyneside, Gateshead and County Durham council areas affected Households banned from mixing and pubs must close between 22:00 and 05:00 Guidance says only essential visits to care homes and hospitals allowed, and people must not go on holiday with other households Comes after a spike in coronavirus with 1,106 new cases in a seven-day period Matt Hancock tells Parliament of a ""concerning rise"" in positive tests Newcastle City Council leader Nick Forbes hopes temporary move will prevent ""full lockdown"" Duncan Leatherdale Explore the data on how the coronavirus pandemic unfolded in the UK. Most people in England and Scotland no longer get free PCRs or LFTs, and rules vary across the rest of the UK. What are the new Covid symptoms, and when should I stay at home? If scientists succeed in making a coronavirus vaccine, when will we get it, how much will it cost and who will get it first? The number of under-17s seeking Covid-19 tests has doubled, the head of NHS Test and Trace tells MPs. That's the end of our live coverage for today as nearly two million people across the North East will seestricter coronavirus restrictions from midnight after a spike in cases. Here's some of the key points:  We'll have more tomorrow from 08:00. If you're affected by these changes and you want to get in touch, or if you have any questions you cantweet us,external, contact us via ourFacebook page,externaloremail us. Take care.  Among the many questions Newcastle City Council has endeavoured to answer today is what to do if people see others breaking the rules. ""Where people
are breaking the rules, we will seek to engage, explain and encourage them to
adhere to the restrictions,"" the council said, adding: ""However, enforcement action will be taken where
appropriate."" It suggests people should report breaches to the police, while concerns about businesses can be sent to the seven councils in the affected areas. ""Once the
legislation is in place, the police or the local authority will be able to take
action against those who break these rules, including asking people to disperse
and issuing fixed penalty notices starting at Â£100 for those who participate in
illegal gatherings,"" a council spokesman said. People aged
18 or over could be fined Â£100 for the first offence, lowered to Â£50 if paid within
14 days, and Â£200 for the second offence, then doubling for each
further offence up to a maximum of Â£3,200. A heavily-pregnant woman has told of the ""misery"" of trying to get a coronavirus test for her ill daughter. Verity Ward from South Shields booked for her three-year-old daughter Romilly to be tested at Doxford Park in Sunderland at 13:30 today after the youngster became ill overnight. Ms Ward is 38 weeks pregnant and due to have a Caesarean operation in the next few days so needs to know if the virus has infected her household. But she and her partner got stuck in a queue on the A19 which had backed up from the testing centre. ""We saw some police cars go up past us, and then eventually a man came down and told each car that the computers at the centre had crashed and they weren't going to be able to do any tests,"" she said. ""As we did a three-point-turn to leave, we saw police stopping other cars from joining the queue so at least those people didn't have to endure the misery. ""As for us, I guess we try again tomorrow. I've got a lot of hospital appointments coming up and I really can't be doing 14 days isolation. I want to know if I'm safe."" Measures to stop households mixing and early pub closures will come into effect from midnight. Eugene Milne, the director of public health in Newcastle, said the seven local authorities are awaiting the final regulations from the government. He said: ""That requires the Department of Health lawyers to comb over them and make sure there is a clear line about which parts are under law and which are advice. I'm hoping we will have those this afternoon. ""This is a very fast moving situation and we would like to get that clarity out to everybody."" He said the government had ""in the main"" granted what the councils had asked for and it was about ""treading a line"" between maintaining enough of the economy that can run within guidance [which] at the same time addresses the problems we have seen"". ""It is the balance of keeping things going as much as we can while controlling the virus, we don't want to flip-flop between lockdown and rapid viral spread on the other hand."" The measures affect seven council areas and come into force from midnight on Thursday. More than 100 people are currently waiting in cars at an empty Sunderland car park, where they say they have been booked in for coronavirus testing. People are arriving at the site, but no staff or equipment are there. Drivers are arriving with print outs of their appointments but no Covid-19 testing is available.

The area covering seven North East councils isnot the first to have local measures put in place: BBC Newcastle Residents of the seven affected North East areas are being advised not to visit people outside of those places, Newcastle's director of public health said. Asked if people could make such visits, Eugene Milne said: ""Again we would advise against that. The restrictions we asked for is for people to be able to travel outside the area but not to meet with people from other households. ""This is about he spread of the virus. We know already with some of the spread we have seen in the region it's happened because of that type of mixing. We want to put a lid on that and get the spread under a manageable level.""  Here are some questions and answers from Newcastle City Council: Can I have someone in my house or go
into someoneâs houseto do repairs or other work? Official tradespeople can go to other peopleâs
homes for work as long as they follow guidance on how to work
safely. Can I still go on holiday? You can still
go on holiday in the UK or abroad, but you should only do this with people
you live with or have a support bubble with. You need to follow rules in the area you visit and be aware of the self-isolation laws when
travelling to and from certain countries. People can
visit the region on holiday but must comply with the local restrictions. What about public transport and car
sharing? Residents are
advised to only use public transport for essential purposes, such as travelling
to school or work. Face
coverings must be worn unless exempt. You are
advised not to share a car with those outside your household or support bubble,
and to use public transport for essential journeys instead. Are the airport, train stations and
ports still open? Newcastle
Airport, train stations and ports remain open and members of the public are
permitted to travel to and from them. Can I move home? Yes It is âquite hard to give you an accurate figureâ on demand for virus tests, says Test and Trace boss. Francesca WilliamsBBC News Within minutes of the new coronavirus restrictions for the North East being published - and even before then - there were questions. Real life doesn't fit neatly into a set of general guidelines and among the many clarifications people were seeking was whether grandparents could carry on looking after children while parents went to work.  The government said no, but Newcastle City Council said it had been lobbying for them to be excluded from the ban on mixing outside a household or support bubble. The discussions, we're told, are still continuing between local and central government on this one. And none of this is made easier by the fact that the government version of what the rules will be is already circulating on social media, while the council's leader insists the official regulations haven't been published yet. Another problem area identified as causing an increase in coronavirus cases is amateur sport. Here are Newcastle City's Council's answers to some of your questions:. What are the changes to playing
sports? Unless
formally organised by a club or organisation, with guidance
issued by a governing body, team sports should not take place anywhere with people who you donât live with. You should
not watch any sports, including professional and
semi-professional events. Can I travel to play sport outside of
the areas with restrictions? Yes, and a face mask should be worn on public transport unless exempt. Can I go to the gym, class or a
swimming pool? Yes, as long
as these venues have the required guidelines
in place. The cancellation follows the announcement of tighter restrictions in the North East. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Negative,5.975056e-12

"People queue for tests in Southampton People up and down the country have been blocked from getting coronavirus tests in recent days, as appointments were paused with the system struggling to cope. Yet the government says capacity is higher than ever. So what's going on in the UK's testing system? Demand for tests has soared, no-one disputes that. What isn't clear is by how much. It's hard to know exactly - the figures aren't capturing all the people who've tried to book and haven't been able to get a test. The combination of people returning from holiday and children going back to school will have put pressure on the system. And early autumn will have brought other respiratory viruses, with symptoms similar to coronavirus - perhaps especially in children. For many, the message that it's essential to get a test if you have symptoms, will have sunk in. Dozens of people have told the BBC of doing so out of a feeling of civic duty. It's something the government appears to have ""underestimated"" the impact of with the rise in cases also coming sooner than thought, says Sir John Bell, of Oxford University. At the same time, sources have expressed concerns about the ""worried well"" - people applying for tests even if they don't have the relevant symptoms. Health Secretary Matt Hancock has claimed a quarter of people wanting tests do not have symptoms, and so are ineligible. When this was queried, the government said this figure was not a formal count. But it has pointed to reports of whole school year groups being told to get tested, and people asking for tests before and after going on holiday. All you need to know about testing Fact checked: Three government claims on testing UK coronavirus cases up by 3,105 on Tuesday Not enough tests for five months, study predicts There is no shortage of swabs, testing centres and staff. There are almost 400 testing centres in total across the UK, including drive-through and walk-in sites, mobile units set up in hotspots and satellite sites at hospitals and care homes. But getting an appointment at one of these has been a challenge, even though pictures have emerged of sites with hardly any people getting tested. Limited lab capacity means the releasing of new appointments is being held back. That's because once you take a swab, there's a narrow window of time to process it in before it becomes invalid. If the labs can't get to it in time, because they are dealing with yesterday's tests, that swab will be wasted. So when labs get behind, there's no point opening up new appointments to test people. The government says testing capacity - which it defines as how many can be processed in the lab each day - is higher than ever. This is true. The capacity has grown rapidly, with latest figures showing nearly 375,000 tests a day can be processed. But this covers a number of different types of tests. There are four ""pillars"" to the testing programme. The first is hospital testing, which is processed in hospital and university labs and reserved for patients and staff. The second is the testing n the community - and is the element of the system that there is currently so much focus on. The other two are an antibody testing programme, which looks at whether people have had the virus previously, and  a surveillance programme run by the Office for National Statistics. This is considered to be an essential way of keeping track of the spread of the virus. Community testing capacity represents less than half the total. And once we dig down more into this data, it becomes clear why tests have had to be rationed. Nearly all the community testing is processed at one of five mega-labs. Back in August it was clear they were close to capacity - in fact all the testing capacity was used up on 23 August. And this goes to the heart of the problem. These labs were built in super-quick time. Ministers often refer to it as the biggest diagnostic testing expansion in history. That is because the UK had very few diagnostic testing facilities of this type. So it chose to centralise the system at these large labs and has worked with a variety of partners, including private companies and universities, to run them. Prof Gordon Dougan, from the University of Cambridge, says it is not surprising they have run into problems and struggled to increase capacity to keep pace with demand. Despite ""valiant efforts, the system is not robust enough"" and is vulnerable to failure at multiple levels from sourcing equipment to finding the right staff, he says. It is understood that one of the biggest limitations is hiring enough qualified people to carry out the tests. YOUR QUESTIONS:We answer your queries THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters LOCAL LOCKDOWNS:What happens if you have one? TEST AND TRACE:How does it work? FURLOUGH:What happens when the scheme ends? This has become a particular issue as academics and post-graduate students have returned to their usual roles. Labs have been unable to offer academic staff contracts. More experienced staff have had to go back to their institutions. This has led to Prime Minister Boris Johnson writing letters to universities asking them to lend their staff and students for a little longer. It's not clear how many, if any, have agreed to this. In order to process more tests, labs will need more space, machines and people. This is happening, but it seems not fast enough to keep up with demand. Lab capacity is being increased. A sixth mega-lab in Newport is in the process of opening. A seventh near Loughborough will follow suit in the coming weeks. This should have a big impact on capacity. But meanwhile, the government has said it will have to prioritise - that means making sure hospitals, care homes and areas with outbreaks can get access to testing. Even when these new labs are fully up and running, there are concerns demand will still outstrip supply. Cases of coronavirus and other respiratory illnesses are going up, so it seems inevitable more people will be seeking access to tests. An analysis by Health Data Research UK warned that if just 80% of people with annual coughs and fevers applied for a test, capacity could be exceeded for the whole winter.

"'Paul' was accused of committing a domestic burglary in June 2018. In early 2019 he was told by police that no further action would be taken against him. However, he was subsequently charged. Last week - over two years since the alleged offence - he appeared at Inner London Crown Court. But his barrister told the court that the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) had still not served the sole evidence - DNA - in the case on the defence. Paul (not his real name) is on bail and had his trial put on provisional ""warned"" list - for December 2021. It means there is no guarantee it will take place at that time - just that it might. The judge explained apologetically that priority is being given to cases where defendants are being held in custody. So, three and a half-years from the date of the alleged offence, there has been no justice for the alleged burglary victim - or the accused. Paul's was one of a number of cases I saw on a visit to Inner London with the chair of the Criminal Bar Association (CBA) James Mulholland QC. He told me it was typical. ""This is justice 2020, but it has been like this for the last 10 years, delay after delay, inbuilt into the system. These cases are being pushed back continuously. ""Lack of investment is at the heart of it and government needs to understand that you don't create a proper justice system without proper investment. ""What we are seeing here are the fruits of a lack of interest."" That apparent ""lack of interest"" is reflected in the state of some court buildings. Outside Inner London I saw a dead pigeon decaying on netting, vast weeds growing up the side of the building and old pipes leaking water. Meanwhile, a court official told me that some court centres are now listing trials for 2023. The delays are caused by a range of factors. Lawyers point to huge cuts to the police, CPS and other agencies such as probation. There are a range of things malfunctioning within the system. They include long initial delays caused by police ""releasing suspects under investigation"" - sometimes for years - before a charging decision is made. Systemic problems continue with the CPS serving evidence late on the defence, meaning lawyers cannot advise their clients in a timely manner. And perhaps most significantly - the decisions by government to cut thousands of crown court sitting days. That has meant that courts have been mothballed while trials stack up in a growing backlog. None of these problems are caused by the coronavirus pandemic and lockdown, but they are of course exacerbated by it. Pre-lockdown the crown court backlog in England and Wales stood at some 37,000. It is now over 46,000. James Mulholland QC says lengthy waits are typical ""Adam"" - not his real name - was accused of rape in March 2018. He denies the charge. His trial has been put back twice, once because of the pandemic. He is now on a ""warned"" list for November, while his chosen career in one of the public services is on hold. ""I have suffered really bad with my mental health through it,"" he says. ""I've had to up my dosage of anti-depressants. It's affected my potential career. ""The hard work I have done at university and everything to get me there it's all basically going out of the window now. I haven't got any trust or hope that it will be anywhere near the end of this year. ""I think it will be more like April next year."" The next case I saw involved two young men charged with possession of drugs with intent to supply.  The alleged offence took place in December 2017. No one in court could explain the delay. It was followed by a case in which the judge needed a pre-sentence report from the probation service in order to sentence the defendant. Despite repeated requests, no one was available. In order to achieve a conclusion of the case, the judge had to devise a sentence which did not require a report.  It was not ideal, but it showed professionals trying to do their best in the face of a lack of resources. Emma Fenn, a barrister specialising in criminal work, paints a bleak picture. ""Defendants are suspended from their jobs with trial dates one to two years away. Some are losing university places with dates from the alleged offence to trial of four years. ""And some who are awaiting trial for 18-24 months on bail, can be on electronic tagged curfew from 7-7 every day, for up to two years."" To help deal with the situation, the government has announced that the period of time an accused person can be held before a trial - known as the Custody Time Limit (CTL) - will be increased from six to eight months. But the government admitted - in response to a Freedom of Information request from the group Fair Trials - that it did not know how many people had been held in prison beyond the time limit since lockdown. Lawyers fear some accused will spend more time in custody awaiting trial than the sentence they would eventually receive if they pleaded guilty - and that some might falsely plead guilty simply to bring an end to their case. 'Please don't forget us': Virus adds to court backlog Locations of 10 temporary courts revealed Covid court plan will not ease delays, lawyers say Life is bleak for those in custody awaiting trial, says Ms Fenn, ""There are often no visits from family or in-person visits from lawyers. Defendants can be locked up for 23.5 hours a day, education classes and courses are suspended, jobs within the prison restricted, and there are reports of showers being limited to 1-2 a week."" Covid has also removed a ""huge amount of mental health, drug and alcohol agency support"", she says. A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said justice had been kept moving ""despite the unprecedented challenges posed by the pandemic"" and overall, cases are falling. However, they acknowledged that ""more needs to be done"". The government has launched an Â£80 million CriminalCourts Recovery plan,externalwhich includes: Employing 1,600 court staff to support recovery measures Introducing plexiglass screens to separate members of the jury to enable safe use of more court rooms Magistrate courts are seeing the number of outstanding cases drop - dealing with over 21,000 cases a week. Increasing capacity through ""Nightingale Courts"" - 10 are up and running, a further eight planned to open shortly Exploring new extended court 'COVID operating hours' However, only three of the new Nightingale Courts are dealing with crime. I visited one, Prospero House, a short walk from Inner London. It is a state of the art commercial building with three large courtrooms allowing ample room for social distancing.  Every desk has hand sanitiser and protective gloves. But Mr Mulholland says: ""We need 60 criminal Nightingale Court buildings. At the moment we have just three."" The CBA says there are around 460 crown courtrooms in England and Wales. Currently around 100 are able to hear trials, though not all are hosting them. The government says its plan will bring on stream another 250 of the existing rooms to hear jury trials by the end of October. The CBA believes that simply will not cut into the backlog. Lawyers believe that the Treasury has long seen justice as a poor relation to health and education in terms of public spending. ""Investing in the criminal justice system is investing in the wealth and prosperity of the country,"" says Mr Mulholland. ""It is an empty and insulting promise for any minister to declare a war on crime if a government can't fund a system that keeps us safe - and ensures crimes are swiftly investigated and cases come to court on time.""

"This video can not be played ""That's my car... submerged"": Video shows flooded streets in Pensacola, Florida Tropical Storm Sally has left more than half a million Americans without power as its torrential rains and storm surges lashed the US Gulf coast. Sally weakened after it made landfall as a Category 2 hurricane on Wednesday, but the slow-moving storm continues to batter Florida and Alabama. One person was killed and hundreds were rescued from flooded areas. Pensacola, in Florida, was badly hit, with a loose barge bringing down part of the Bay Bridge. ""Catastrophic and life-threatening flooding continues over portions of the Florida Panhandle and southern Alabama,"" the National Hurricane Center (NHC) said. The wind ripped the roof off this house in Perdido Key, Florida The storm has brought ""four months of rain in four hours"" to the city, Pensacola fire chief Ginny Cranor told CNN. One person died and another was missing in the town of Orange Beach, Alabama, the mayor said without giving further details. Sally made landfall at Gulf Shores, Alabama, at 04:45 local time on Wednesday, with maximum wind speeds of 105mph (169 km/h). According to the NHC, Category 2 hurricanes havesustained winds of 96 to 110 mph,external. The NHC says a Category 2 storm's ""extremely dangerous winds"" usually cause damage to homes and shallowly rooted trees. The storm later become a tropical depression with winds decreasing to 35mph, but it has been the torrents of rainfall and high storm surges that have caused most damage. As the storm moved north from the coast, some 550,000 residents in affected areas were left in the dark on Wednesday night, according to local reports. Sally is one of several storms in the Atlantic Ocean, with officials running out of letters to name the hurricanes as they near the end of their annual alphabetic list. Rainfall is being measured in feet rather than inches in some places, but 18in (45cm) has been recorded across many areas. Hurricanes: A guide to the world's deadliest storms The busy hurricane season about to 'go Greek' Climate row as Trump visits fire-hit US West Coast Flooding to a depth of 5ft hit central Pensacola. The storm surge was the third worst ever to hit the city. Police there told people not to go out to look at the damage, saying: ""It's slowing our progress down. Please stay at home!"" Although the winds did not have the devastating powerof the deadly Hurricane Laura, which struck last month, they still ripped boats from moorings and sent one barge careering into the under-construction Bay Bridge. They were certainly high enough to topple high-sided vehicles. One of the barges that broke free in Pensacola, Florida Another barge got loose and headed for the Escambia Bay Bridge but luckily ran ashore. The sheriff of Escambia County said it had not been expecting the devastation wrought by Sally. Overturned vehicle in Mobile, Alabama. Many roads there were hit by falling trees Cavin Hollyhand, 50, who lives in Mobile, Alabama, told Reuters: ""The rain is what stands out with this one: It's unreal."" There remains ""a danger of life-threatening inundation"" on the Florida-Alabama border, the NHC said. Alabama Governor Kay Ivey said many areas around Mobile were seeing historic flood levels and urged people to heed warnings. The pier at Gulf State Park in Alabama suffered significant damage. Gulf Shores in Alabama hosted Sally's landfall and its torrential rain The latest on power cuts fromthe poweroutage.us website,externallists some 290,000 customers without electricity in Alabama and 253,000 more in Florida. As well as pylons being brought down, many trees were uprooted. Rain appeared to fall sideways in Alabama, which led to submerged roads as the storm inched ashore. Other areas along the coast were also affected, with beaches and highways swamped in Mississippi and low-lying properties in Louisiana covered by the rising waters. Alabama, Florida and Mississippi all declared states of emergency ahead of the storm. John De Block, at the National Weather Service in Birmingham, Alabama, told the New York Times that Sally was drifting ""at the speed of a child in a candy shop"". Sally's pace may be linked to climate change, according to experts. A 2018 study in Nature magazine found that the speed at which hurricanes and tropical storms move over an area had decreased by 10% between 1949 and 2016, a drop that was linked to an increase in total rainfall. ""Sally has a characteristic that isn't often seen, and that's a slow forward speed and that's going to exacerbate the flooding,"" NHC deputy director Ed Rappaport told the Associated Press. In addition to Sally, there are four other tropical cyclones - Paulette, Rene, Teddy and Vicky - swirling in the Atlantic Ocean basin. If only one more storm is officially named - Wilfred has already been chosen - meteorologists will run out of preselected names for the rest of the year and so will begin naming new storms after the Greek alphabet.

Mr Greaves also said he couldn't understand how the rules would help stop the spread of the coronavirus. ""It could even be a little bit dangerous with people going to the pub, necking as much as they can and then they end up drunk and are like 'let's go to a house or something'.

This video can not be played A cold, flu or coronavirus - which one do I have? Colds, flu and Covid-19 are caused by different viruses but can have similar symptoms. It can be hard to judge which one you may have. Most people who feel ill with coronaviruswill have at least one of the key symptoms:  Read our explainer hereon the other things to look for out for. Lucy WilliamsonBBC News, Marseille Whatâs striking, as you enter the main intensive care unit
at Marseilleâs La Timone hospital, is the laughter and banter of the
staff.  Protection comes in many different guises. Around them, in isolation rooms, are 13 seriously ill
patients with coronavirus. Each time they enter, the medical teams need
to step into full, zip-up body suits, and put on masks and gloves. For the
riskiest operations, they add helmets, and portable ventilators to purify the
air inside them as they work. On the day we visit, doctors are trying to save the life of
a 65-year-old man on life support.  Looking more like astronauts than
medical staff, they step inside the glass screen, and thread a camera down the
patientâs throat. Theyâre checking for blockages before trying to oxygenate
his blood by machine â a last resort. The ghostly figures hovering around his bed are the
patientâs only visitors. His wife calls the unit once or twice every day
for news.  But contamination risks mean sheâs not allowed in to see him. This unit is now the epicentre of Franceâs new Covid crisis. The director of public hospitals in Marseille has said the city is ânearing saturationâ and that 100 extra staff have been recruited
in the past week, to try and keep pace with demand. Rates of infection here are now twice that of Paris. More than 10% of those tested here are positive. But despite France meeting its target of a million tests a
week, many people are facing long waits for testing or results. The government has told testing centres to prioritise those
with symptoms or confirmed contact with cases, but the health minister today
admitted there were still problems including bottlenecks in big cities. As Canada moves into the
cooler days of autumn, people in parts of the country will see social
gatherings being newly restricted as Covid-19 cases surge. In some parts of the province of Ontario - including Toronto, Canada's largest city - outdoor gatherings will
now be restricted to a maximum of 25, down from 100. Indoor gatherings are no
limited to 10, down from 50. That includes backyard
parties and picnics, provincial Premier Doug Ford said, warning of hefty fines
for rule-breakers. â ""We will throw the
book at you if you break the rules,"" he said. Party hosts could receive fines of C$10,000 ($7,500; Â£5,800), with attendees getting C$750
tickets. Ford called partygoers
who have been reckless ""a few fries short of a Happy Meal"". Covid-19 cases have been
increasing though they still are lower than in the months of April and May.
There were 293 new cases in Ontario today. Toronto, the nearby Peel Region, and Canada's capital Ottawa are hotspots in the province. Captain Sir Tom Moore has launched his charitable foundation after raising more than Â£32m for NHS charities during lockdown. He said he wanted to help those going through difficulties, referring to his late wife Pamela's struggles with mental health. He said the foundation will support people ""where a little bit of hope will do them some good"". Speaking to BBC Breakfast's Naga Munchetty from his garden, he said his wife's mental health problems started when she was a child and got worse and worse. When Capt Sir Tom could no longer look after her properly, she went into a home. She was expected to be treated for six weeks but stayed until she died from dementia. The inspiration for his foundation, called The Captain Tom Foundation, came from seeing many ""lonely"" ladies in the home who had no visitors, he said. ""That's one of the things that the foundation is, to help lonely people and people who are in difficulties, not just old people, there are some young people that are not properly looked after."" Laura KuenssbergPolitical editor Nearly 10 million people's lives are under limits again. The number of coronavirus cases is rising fast. Concerned members of the public are stuck in frustrated queues for coronavirus tests in some parts of the country. The tide was not turned. Life is not back to normal. And even some Conservative MPs are asking, what on earth is going on? Read the full blog here. France has ramped up testing for coronavirus Staff at coronavirus laboratories in France have joined a strike, protesting against poor working conditions. The CGT labour union told Reuters news agency that several hundred staff from coronavirus laboratories were taking part in the action, and that it was disrupting testing in some towns. The union said the strike could drag on if laboratory bosses failed to deal with complaints over staff shortages and pay. ""We're overwhelmed,"" one laboratory nurse told Reuters. ""We're exhausted, physically and mentally."" A technician told the news agency the pace of work was ârelentlessâ and that workers were doing free overtime. France has ramped up testing for coronavirus, and now conducts more than one million tests a week, according to officials. But people have complained of long queues at testing centres and delays in receiving results. A representative of employers in the sector said the strike was having a minimal impact on testing. Like other countries in Europe, France has reported a surge in coronavirus cases in recent weeks. How the National Theatre's Olivier Theatre will look when it reopens The National Theatre, on London's South Bank,is to reopen after remodelling its largest stage. The Olivier can usually seat 1,150 people. But when it opens in October, there will be an audience of just under 500, watching performances in the round. A new play called Death of England: Delroy is first to be staged, before pantomime returns to the National Theatre as a one-off, with performances of Dick Whittington in December. The venue - closed since 16 March - said it was ""delighted and relieved to be reopening"". Marianna SpringDisinformation and social media reporter A
video being widely shared on Facebook and Instagram is being accompanied by
false claims that receiving a coronavirus vaccine has already been made
mandatory and that it will be used to inject microchips into people. The video, originally posted on TikTok and viewed over 3 million times, does
not itself refer to coronavirus.  In it, a British woman says her daughter
was vaccinated at school without her consent and she doesnât know âwhat sheâs
had put in herâ. The
shared video has been accompanied by false claims that a coronavirus vaccine
has already been made mandatory in the UK and that it will be used to inject
microchips into people. Weâve
looked into these claims before, andthere is currently no legislation in
the UK making vaccines mandatory- although the government has not ruled
this out for a coronavirus vaccine in the future. There is also absolutely no
evidence that a vaccine will be a tool to microchip or deliberately cause harm
to individuals. According
to subsequent videos being shared, this womanâs daughter was administered the
HPV vaccine - even though she had said she did not want her daughter to receive
it. This vaccine protects against high-risk HPV infections, which can lead
to many cervical cancers - and some others. The woman in the video points out that there is a clause on the NHS website
that states if a parent does not consent to a child receiving the HPV vaccine
âthe nurse can override my decision and vaccinate my children if they show an
interest in having this doneâ.While this is true, the child still has to indicate consent,external. There is a ""high risk"" that a spike in Covid cases will lead to more hospital admissions and deaths in locked-down areas of Wales, health officials have warned. Dr Robin Howe, of Public Health Wales, said older people are being infected in Caerphilly and Rhondda Cynon Taf. It comes as people in Rhondda expressed frustration atbecoming the second area in Wales to return to lockdown after Caerphilly. Strict rules came into force at 18:00 BST for the area's 240,000 residents.

In person-learning was set to begin on Monday. Instead, the city is phasing the return of students to the classroom, with only pre-kindergarten children and students with special learning needs now set to start on Monday. Under the new plans, first grade to eighth grade students will begin on 29 September, while middle- and high-school students will start on 1 October. Students will continue with remote-learning in the meantime. It is the second time the mayor has delayed the return to classrooms, which was originally due to happen on 10 September. The mayor is expected to give more details later. Wearing masks is now compulsary in some parts of France As Europe grapples with a significant rise in cases, governments are introducing measures to try to control the spread of coronavirus. Some of those measures are reintroduced restrictions from the first lockdowns earlier this year. In France masks must worn outdoors in some areas by anyone aged 11 and over, including busy streets in Paris. They must also be worn in workplaces. And in Germany, testing is compulsory for arrivals at airports from high-risk countries. Read more about what European countries are doing to try to limit the spread of infection.  Congressman Clyburn called the comparison ""the most ridiculous, tone-deaf, God-awful thing I've ever heard"" US Attorney General William Barr, a top Trump appointee and the highest ranking US law enforcement official, has drawn fire for comparing Covid-19 lockdown orders to the historical US enslavement of black people. ""You know, putting a national lockdown, stay at home orders, is like house arrest. Other than slavery, which was a different kind of restraint, this is the greatest intrusion on civil liberties in American history,"" he told a college in Michigan on Wednesday. In a CNN interview, Democratic Congressman James Clyburn - the highest-ranked African-American in the House of Representatives - slammed the remark as ""the most ridiculous, tone-deaf, God-awful thing I've ever heard"". ""It is incredible that the chief law enforcement officer in this country would equate human bondage to expert advice to save lives. Slavery was not about saving lives, it was about devaluing lives."" He pointed out that the federal government never instituted a lockdown, and they were instead ordered by the states. Congressman Hakeem Jeffries, who is also black, took issue with Barr's description of slavery as a form of ârestraint,â telling CNN it was actually âone of the worst crimes against humanity ever committedâ. The UK government has removed Slovenia and the French Caribbean island of Guadeloupe from England's safe travel list, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has announced. Mr Shapps said people in Slovenia and Guadeloupe who arrive after 04:00 on Saturday will need to self-isolate for 14 days. The government also announced that passengers arriving back from Singapore and Thailand will not be required to quarantine as those countries have been added to the safe travel list. The Scottish Government has confirmed the changes announced today will also apply there.  Smitha MundasadNews reporter The World Health Organization has repeated its plea for countries not to shorten the quarantine period for people who have been exposed to coronavirus. The global health body recommends anyone who has been in close contact with someone who has definitely got coronavirus or probably has, should stay at home or somewhere similar for two weeks. The idea is simple -  to monitor people in case they get ill and spot Covid-19 cases early on, preventing the virus from spreading further. The Centrers for Disease Control and Prevention in the US, for example, says based on the best current studies, it is likely that the time from someone being exposed to getting symptoms is between two and 14 days. It's evidence like this that is behind the WHO's advice. And in the UK  if you are told by the Test and Trace system that you have had close contact with someone who has coronavirus, you must isolate for 14 days. But France is reportedly taking a different approach. It is slashing its isolation time from 14 fourteen days to seven. That's because health experts there say the majority of people find it too difficult to isolate for a whole two weeks. They also say this is when people are most likely to be infectious. There are also some small studies that suggest people are most likely to pass on the virus in the first week they have symptoms. But the science is still emerging and scientists across the globe agree there are still many uncertainties. That's why different countries have different approaches - each has to balance the evidence, the unknowns and the chance for citizens to get back to a more normal life. NHS Test and Trace chief Baroness Dido Harding is asked about test turnaround times. She acknowledges tests have been taking ""slightly longer than usual"" in the last ""week or so"". People are waiting longer for coronavirus test results from England's community testing centres, figures showed today. Only a third of tests carried out in these venues came back in 24 hours in the week up to 9 September. Baroness Harding says: ""We have very consciously in the last couple of weeks, when we've seen the very significant increase in demand, made use of every single day of the seven days of lab capacity to try and maximise the total number of people who have been tested. ""And what that has meant is that for some people the testing turnarounds have gone out a bit."" Â© 2025 BBC.

"This video can not be played Asked if the EU is negotiating a trade deal with the UK in good faith, Boris Johnson says: âI donât believe they areâ. No 10 has reached a deal with some of the Tory MPs unhappy with plans to give the government the power to override parts of the UK's Brexit agreement. Boris Johnson has agreed to amend the Internal Market Bill, giving MPs a vote before he could use the powers in it that would break international law. The move could head off a potential rebellion over the issue next week. But Labour said the UK was on course to break its word, as a senior government legal officer quit over the issue. Lord Keen, Scotland's Advocate General,stood downon Wednesday after days of speculation about his future. In his resignation letter, he told the PM: ""I have found it increasingly difficult to reconcile what I consider to be my obligations as a Law Officer with your policy intentions."" Kuenssberg: No 10 not backing down Law officer offers resignation over Brexit bill How could the Northern Ireland Brexit deal change? The peer, who served in the Ministry of Justice, objected to proposed legislation which would allow the government to override parts of the EU withdrawal agreement, in contravention of international law. But less than a hour after his exit was confirmed, Downing Street said it had reached a compromise with two critics of sections of the bill, ex-justice minister Sir Bob Neill and former work and pensions secretary Damian Green. Agovernment amendment,externalto the bill, published on Thursday, would prevent ministers from activating powers in the bill to override the Brexit divorce deal until MPs had voted to approve it first. The provision is similar to the changes to the bill proposed by Sir Bob, who will now drop his planned amendment. Ministers have also tabled amendments to place a time-limit on attempts to question the legality of controversial sections of the bill via judicial review. Tonight's compromise - some would say U-turn - between Downing Street and potential Conservative rebels appears to have solved one short-term problem. It staves off the prospect of a serious, if not fatal, show of high-profile dissent next week when MPs debate the specific clauses of the bill that would breach international law. The ""parliamentary lock"" would allow MPs as a whole, and not just ministers, to decide whether to press the political equivalent of the nuclear button. It is thought MPs may be less likely to do so. But this compromise won't be enough to stop the bill being potentially savaged in the Lords. Eminent peers with a background in the legal profession maintain that it is still wrong to legislate with the intention of breaking international law. They will be bolstered by Lord Keen's resignation - as he has made it clear that he couldn't reconcile his responsibilities as a law officer with the government's policy. And Brussels is insisting that the clauses which override part of the Brexit deal in Northern Ireland should be removed entirely. Otherwise the EU could take the UK government to court. In a joint statement with No 10, Mr Green - head of a centrist group of Tory MPs - said: ""The Internal Market Bill was designed to give MPs and peers a vote on the use of these powers via statutory instrument. ""But following talks, it is agreed that the Parliamentary procedure suggested by some colleagues provides a clearer, more explicit democratic mandate for the use of these powers, and also provides more legal certainty."" The statement claims that on the Tory benches there is ""near-unanimous agreement that the government must be able to use these powers as a final resort, that there must be legal certainty, and that no further amendments are required on these powers"". Mr Green urged the government to focus on settling the terms of its future economic partnership with the bloc before the 15 October deadline set by the PM. Allow Twitter content?

Senior Tory backbencher Sir Roger Gale, who hadthreatenedto vote against the bill unless it was changed, welcomed the government's plans to amend it. In a tweet on Thursday, he wrote: ""Good that Bob Neill's amendment, which I endorsed, has effectively been accepted. ""At least Parliament will now have the chance to vote again if the government proposes to change the withdrawal agreement."" The bill has provoked a backlash from the EU, which has threatened legal action - and the possible suspension of trade talks - if the measures overriding the withdrawal agreement are not withdrawn. And Labour's shadow business secretary Ed Miliband said his party would continue opposing the legislation. Responding to the joint statement on Wednesday he said: ""This does not fix the problem of breaking the law, damaging our reputation around the world and damaging our future prosperity. ""We need a trade deal with Europe and that is what we were promised. Breaking our own word and the treaty the prime minister signed puts that at risk."" Defending the bill on Wednesday during an appearance before a committee of senior MPs, Mr Johnson said he believed the EU may not be negotiating with the UK in good faith over the agreement's implementation. Pressed by Labour's Hilary Benn on whether he thought the EU was negotiating in good faith, he said: ""I don't believe they are."" This contradicted Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis, who earlier told MPs he believed the EU was acting in good faith. When that was put to him, Mr Johnson said it was ""always possible that I am mistaken and perhaps they will prove my suspicions wrong"". Both sides have a duty to act in good faith under Article 5 of the withdrawal agreement - but it is difficult to demonstrate a lack of ""good faith"" or ""best endeavours"" - another phrase enshrined in the treaty. The legal definition of ""good faith"" is stronger than the generally accepted meaning of the words. The bill sets out rules for the operation of the UK internal market - trade between England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland - after the end of the Brexit transition period in January. It proposes: No new checks on goods moving from Northern Ireland to the rest of Great Britain Giving UK ministers powers to modify or ""disapply"" rules relating to the movement of goods that will come into force from 1 January if the UK and EU are unable to reach an alternative agreement through a trade deal Powers to override previously agreed obligations on state aid - government support for businesses. The bill explicitly states that these powers should apply even if they are incompatible with international law. Ministers say the legislation is needed to prevent ""damaging"" tariffs on goods travelling from the rest of the UK to Northern Ireland if negotiations with the EU on a free trade agreement fail. The legislation has alsoproved controversial with the devolved administrations, which are concerned about how the UK's ""internal market"" will operate post-Brexit and who will set regulations and standards.

Nick Greaves, who runs The Patricia in Jesmond, said: ""It's a bit of a shock. We have come so far to get back on our feet and now we are back down in this saga again."" He said the 22:00 curfew puts his restaurant ""in an awkward position"". ""We have changed the restaurant to have people much more spaced out time wise, in three sittings almost,"" Mr Greaves said. ""It's going to take out that 20.30 table sitting."" He said the restaurant offers a six-course menu that takes about two and a half hours to work through. Mr Greaves also said he couldn't understand how the rules would help stop the spread of the coronavirus. ""It could even be a little bit dangerous with people going to the pub, necking as much as they can and then they end up drunk and are like 'let's go to a house or something'.

This video can not be played A cold, flu or coronavirus - which one do I have? Colds, flu and Covid-19 are caused by different viruses but can have similar symptoms. It can be hard to judge which one you may have. Most people who feel ill with coronaviruswill have at least one of the key symptoms:  Read our explainer hereon the other things to look for out for. Lucy WilliamsonBBC News, Marseille Whatâs striking, as you enter the main intensive care unit
at Marseilleâs La Timone hospital, is the laughter and banter of the
staff.  Protection comes in many different guises. Around them, in isolation rooms, are 13 seriously ill
patients with coronavirus. Each time they enter, the medical teams need
to step into full, zip-up body suits, and put on masks and gloves. For the
riskiest operations, they add helmets, and portable ventilators to purify the
air inside them as they work. On the day we visit, doctors are trying to save the life of
a 65-year-old man on life support.  Looking more like astronauts than
medical staff, they step inside the glass screen, and thread a camera down the
patientâs throat. Theyâre checking for blockages before trying to oxygenate
his blood by machine â a last resort. The ghostly figures hovering around his bed are the
patientâs only visitors. His wife calls the unit once or twice every day
for news.  But contamination risks mean sheâs not allowed in to see him. This unit is now the epicentre of Franceâs new Covid crisis. The director of public hospitals in Marseille has said the city is ânearing saturationâ and that 100 extra staff have been recruited
in the past week, to try and keep pace with demand. Rates of infection here are now twice that of Paris. More than 10% of those tested here are positive. But despite France meeting its target of a million tests a
week, many people are facing long waits for testing or results. The government has told testing centres to prioritise those
with symptoms or confirmed contact with cases, but the health minister today
admitted there were still problems including bottlenecks in big cities. As Canada moves into the
cooler days of autumn, people in parts of the country will see social
gatherings being newly restricted as Covid-19 cases surge. In some parts of the province of Ontario - including Toronto, Canada's largest city - outdoor gatherings will
now be restricted to a maximum of 25, down from 100. Indoor gatherings are no
limited to 10, down from 50. That includes backyard
parties and picnics, provincial Premier Doug Ford said, warning of hefty fines
for rule-breakers. â ""We will throw the
book at you if you break the rules,"" he said. Party hosts could receive fines of C$10,000 ($7,500; Â£5,800), with attendees getting C$750
tickets. Ford called partygoers
who have been reckless ""a few fries short of a Happy Meal"". Covid-19 cases have been
increasing though they still are lower than in the months of April and May.
There were 293 new cases in Ontario today. Toronto, the nearby Peel Region, and Canada's capital Ottawa are hotspots in the province. Captain Sir Tom Moore has launched his charitable foundation after raising more than Â£32m for NHS charities during lockdown. He said he wanted to help those going through difficulties, referring to his late wife Pamela's struggles with mental health. He said the foundation will support people ""where a little bit of hope will do them some good"". Speaking to BBC Breakfast's Naga Munchetty from his garden, he said his wife's mental health problems started when she was a child and got worse and worse. When Capt Sir Tom could no longer look after her properly, she went into a home. She was expected to be treated for six weeks but stayed until she died from dementia. The inspiration for his foundation, called The Captain Tom Foundation, came from seeing many ""lonely"" ladies in the home who had no visitors, he said. ""That's one of the things that the foundation is, to help lonely people and people who are in difficulties, not just old people, there are some young people that are not properly looked after."" Laura KuenssbergPolitical editor Nearly 10 million people's lives are under limits again. The number of coronavirus cases is rising fast. Concerned members of the public are stuck in frustrated queues for coronavirus tests in some parts of the country. The tide was not turned. Life is not back to normal. And even some Conservative MPs are asking, what on earth is going on? Read the full blog here. France has ramped up testing for coronavirus Staff at coronavirus laboratories in France have joined a strike, protesting against poor working conditions. The CGT labour union told Reuters news agency that several hundred staff from coronavirus laboratories were taking part in the action, and that it was disrupting testing in some towns. The union said the strike could drag on if laboratory bosses failed to deal with complaints over staff shortages and pay. ""We're overwhelmed,"" one laboratory nurse told Reuters. ""We're exhausted, physically and mentally."" A technician told the news agency the pace of work was ârelentlessâ and that workers were doing free overtime. France has ramped up testing for coronavirus, and now conducts more than one million tests a week, according to officials. But people have complained of long queues at testing centres and delays in receiving results. A representative of employers in the sector said the strike was having a minimal impact on testing. Like other countries in Europe, France has reported a surge in coronavirus cases in recent weeks. How the National Theatre's Olivier Theatre will look when it reopens The National Theatre, on London's South Bank,is to reopen after remodelling its largest stage. The Olivier can usually seat 1,150 people. But when it opens in October, there will be an audience of just under 500, watching performances in the round. A new play called Death of England: Delroy is first to be staged, before pantomime returns to the National Theatre as a one-off, with performances of Dick Whittington in December. The venue - closed since 16 March - said it was ""delighted and relieved to be reopening"". Marianna SpringDisinformation and social media reporter A
video being widely shared on Facebook and Instagram is being accompanied by
false claims that receiving a coronavirus vaccine has already been made
mandatory and that it will be used to inject microchips into people. The video, originally posted on TikTok and viewed over 3 million times, does
not itself refer to coronavirus.  In it, a British woman says her daughter
was vaccinated at school without her consent and she doesnât know âwhat sheâs
had put in herâ. The
shared video has been accompanied by false claims that a coronavirus vaccine
has already been made mandatory in the UK and that it will be used to inject
microchips into people. Weâve
looked into these claims before, andthere is currently no legislation in
the UK making vaccines mandatory- although the government has not ruled
this out for a coronavirus vaccine in the future. There is also absolutely no
evidence that a vaccine will be a tool to microchip or deliberately cause harm
to individuals. According
to subsequent videos being shared, this womanâs daughter was administered the
HPV vaccine - even though she had said she did not want her daughter to receive
it. This vaccine protects against high-risk HPV infections, which can lead
to many cervical cancers - and some others. The woman in the video points out that there is a clause on the NHS website
that states if a parent does not consent to a child receiving the HPV vaccine
âthe nurse can override my decision and vaccinate my children if they show an
interest in having this doneâ.While this is true, the child still has to indicate consent,external. There is a ""high risk"" that a spike in Covid cases will lead to more hospital admissions and deaths in locked-down areas of Wales, health officials have warned. Dr Robin Howe, of Public Health Wales, said older people are being infected in Caerphilly and Rhondda Cynon Taf. It comes as people in Rhondda expressed frustration atbecoming the second area in Wales to return to lockdown after Caerphilly. Strict rules came into force at 18:00 BST for the area's 240,000 residents.

But the plan was axed by White House officials who felt it would create a panic among Americans, an unnamed White House officialtold the Post,external. ""There was concern from some in the White House Domestic Policy Council and the office of the vice president that households receiving masks might create concern or panic,"" the official said.

Ripdorf fielded the minimum number of players possible in the game on Sunday because their opponents, SV Holdenstedt II, had come into contact with someone who tested positive for coronavirus in a recent match. Their team tested negative but Ripdorf said the conditions were not safe. Ripdorf asked for the match to be postponed but the local association refused, and the team would have faced a â¬200 (Â£182) fine if they had not played. Read the full story Teachers have been preparing for the return of in-person learning New York City has delayed the start of in-person learning at public schools for a second time for most students, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced. In person-learning was set to begin on Monday. Instead, the city is phasing the return of students to the classroom, with only pre-kindergarten children and students with special learning needs now set to start on Monday. Under the new plans, first grade to eighth grade students will begin on 29 September, while middle- and high-school students will start on 1 October. Students will continue with remote-learning in the meantime. It is the second time the mayor has delayed the return to classrooms, which was originally due to happen on 10 September. The mayor is expected to give more details later. Wearing masks is now compulsary in some parts of France As Europe grapples with a significant rise in cases, governments are introducing measures to try to control the spread of coronavirus. Some of those measures are reintroduced restrictions from the first lockdowns earlier this year. In France masks must worn outdoors in some areas by anyone aged 11 and over, including busy streets in Paris. They must also be worn in workplaces. And in Germany, testing is compulsory for arrivals at airports from high-risk countries. Read more about what European countries are doing to try to limit the spread of infection.  Congressman Clyburn called the comparison ""the most ridiculous, tone-deaf, God-awful thing I've ever heard"" US Attorney General William Barr, a top Trump appointee and the highest ranking US law enforcement official, has drawn fire for comparing Covid-19 lockdown orders to the historical US enslavement of black people. ""You know, putting a national lockdown, stay at home orders, is like house arrest. Other than slavery, which was a different kind of restraint, this is the greatest intrusion on civil liberties in American history,"" he told a college in Michigan on Wednesday. In a CNN interview, Democratic Congressman James Clyburn - the highest-ranked African-American in the House of Representatives - slammed the remark as ""the most ridiculous, tone-deaf, God-awful thing I've ever heard"". ""It is incredible that the chief law enforcement officer in this country would equate human bondage to expert advice to save lives. Slavery was not about saving lives, it was about devaluing lives."" He pointed out that the federal government never instituted a lockdown, and they were instead ordered by the states. Congressman Hakeem Jeffries, who is also black, took issue with Barr's description of slavery as a form of ârestraint,â telling CNN it was actually âone of the worst crimes against humanity ever committedâ. The UK government has removed Slovenia and the French Caribbean island of Guadeloupe from England's safe travel list, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has announced. Mr Shapps said people in Slovenia and Guadeloupe who arrive after 04:00 on Saturday will need to self-isolate for 14 days. The government also announced that passengers arriving back from Singapore and Thailand will not be required to quarantine as those countries have been added to the safe travel list. The Scottish Government has confirmed the changes announced today will also apply there.  Smitha MundasadNews reporter The World Health Organization has repeated its plea for countries not to shorten the quarantine period for people who have been exposed to coronavirus. The global health body recommends anyone who has been in close contact with someone who has definitely got coronavirus or probably has, should stay at home or somewhere similar for two weeks. The idea is simple -  to monitor people in case they get ill and spot Covid-19 cases early on, preventing the virus from spreading further. The Centrers for Disease Control and Prevention in the US, for example, says based on the best current studies, it is likely that the time from someone being exposed to getting symptoms is between two and 14 days. It's evidence like this that is behind the WHO's advice. And in the UK  if you are told by the Test and Trace system that you have had close contact with someone who has coronavirus, you must isolate for 14 days. But France is reportedly taking a different approach. It is slashing its isolation time from 14 fourteen days to seven. That's because health experts there say the majority of people find it too difficult to isolate for a whole two weeks. They also say this is when people are most likely to be infectious. There are also some small studies that suggest people are most likely to pass on the virus in the first week they have symptoms. But the science is still emerging and scientists across the globe agree there are still many uncertainties. That's why different countries have different approaches - each has to balance the evidence, the unknowns and the chance for citizens to get back to a more normal life. NHS Test and Trace chief Baroness Dido Harding is asked about test turnaround times. She acknowledges tests have been taking ""slightly longer than usual"" in the last ""week or so"". People are waiting longer for coronavirus test results from England's community testing centres, figures showed today. Only a third of tests carried out in these venues came back in 24 hours in the week up to 9 September. Baroness Harding says: ""We have very consciously in the last couple of weeks, when we've seen the very significant increase in demand, made use of every single day of the seven days of lab capacity to try and maximise the total number of people who have been tested. ""And what that has meant is that for some people the testing turnarounds have gone out a bit."" Â© 2025 BBC.

"'Paul' was accused of committing a domestic burglary in June 2018. In early 2019 he was told by police that no further action would be taken against him. However, he was subsequently charged. Last week - over two years since the alleged offence - he appeared at Inner London Crown Court. But his barrister told the court that the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) had still not served the sole evidence - DNA - in the case on the defence. Paul (not his real name) is on bail and had his trial put on provisional ""warned"" list - for December 2021. It means there is no guarantee it will take place at that time - just that it might. The judge explained apologetically that priority is being given to cases where defendants are being held in custody. So, three and a half-years from the date of the alleged offence, there has been no justice for the alleged burglary victim - or the accused. Paul's was one of a number of cases I saw on a visit to Inner London with the chair of the Criminal Bar Association (CBA) James Mulholland QC. He told me it was typical. ""This is justice 2020, but it has been like this for the last 10 years, delay after delay, inbuilt into the system. These cases are being pushed back continuously. ""Lack of investment is at the heart of it and government needs to understand that you don't create a proper justice system without proper investment. ""What we are seeing here are the fruits of a lack of interest."" That apparent ""lack of interest"" is reflected in the state of some court buildings. Outside Inner London I saw a dead pigeon decaying on netting, vast weeds growing up the side of the building and old pipes leaking water. Meanwhile, a court official told me that some court centres are now listing trials for 2023. The delays are caused by a range of factors. Lawyers point to huge cuts to the police, CPS and other agencies such as probation. There are a range of things malfunctioning within the system. They include long initial delays caused by police ""releasing suspects under investigation"" - sometimes for years - before a charging decision is made. Systemic problems continue with the CPS serving evidence late on the defence, meaning lawyers cannot advise their clients in a timely manner. And perhaps most significantly - the decisions by government to cut thousands of crown court sitting days. That has meant that courts have been mothballed while trials stack up in a growing backlog. None of these problems are caused by the coronavirus pandemic and lockdown, but they are of course exacerbated by it. Pre-lockdown the crown court backlog in England and Wales stood at some 37,000. It is now over 46,000. James Mulholland QC says lengthy waits are typical ""Adam"" - not his real name - was accused of rape in March 2018. He denies the charge. His trial has been put back twice, once because of the pandemic. He is now on a ""warned"" list for November, while his chosen career in one of the public services is on hold. ""I have suffered really bad with my mental health through it,"" he says. ""I've had to up my dosage of anti-depressants. It's affected my potential career. ""The hard work I have done at university and everything to get me there it's all basically going out of the window now. I haven't got any trust or hope that it will be anywhere near the end of this year. ""I think it will be more like April next year."" The next case I saw involved two young men charged with possession of drugs with intent to supply.  The alleged offence took place in December 2017. No one in court could explain the delay. It was followed by a case in which the judge needed a pre-sentence report from the probation service in order to sentence the defendant. Despite repeated requests, no one was available. In order to achieve a conclusion of the case, the judge had to devise a sentence which did not require a report.  It was not ideal, but it showed professionals trying to do their best in the face of a lack of resources. Emma Fenn, a barrister specialising in criminal work, paints a bleak picture. ""Defendants are suspended from their jobs with trial dates one to two years away. Some are losing university places with dates from the alleged offence to trial of four years. ""And some who are awaiting trial for 18-24 months on bail, can be on electronic tagged curfew from 7-7 every day, for up to two years."" To help deal with the situation, the government has announced that the period of time an accused person can be held before a trial - known as the Custody Time Limit (CTL) - will be increased from six to eight months. But the government admitted - in response to a Freedom of Information request from the group Fair Trials - that it did not know how many people had been held in prison beyond the time limit since lockdown. Lawyers fear some accused will spend more time in custody awaiting trial than the sentence they would eventually receive if they pleaded guilty - and that some might falsely plead guilty simply to bring an end to their case. 'Please don't forget us': Virus adds to court backlog Locations of 10 temporary courts revealed Covid court plan will not ease delays, lawyers say Life is bleak for those in custody awaiting trial, says Ms Fenn, ""There are often no visits from family or in-person visits from lawyers. Defendants can be locked up for 23.5 hours a day, education classes and courses are suspended, jobs within the prison restricted, and there are reports of showers being limited to 1-2 a week."" Covid has also removed a ""huge amount of mental health, drug and alcohol agency support"", she says. A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said justice had been kept moving ""despite the unprecedented challenges posed by the pandemic"" and overall, cases are falling. However, they acknowledged that ""more needs to be done"". The government has launched an Â£80 million CriminalCourts Recovery plan,externalwhich includes: Employing 1,600 court staff to support recovery measures Introducing plexiglass screens to separate members of the jury to enable safe use of more court rooms Magistrate courts are seeing the number of outstanding cases drop - dealing with over 21,000 cases a week. Increasing capacity through ""Nightingale Courts"" - 10 are up and running, a further eight planned to open shortly Exploring new extended court 'COVID operating hours' However, only three of the new Nightingale Courts are dealing with crime. I visited one, Prospero House, a short walk from Inner London. It is a state of the art commercial building with three large courtrooms allowing ample room for social distancing.  Every desk has hand sanitiser and protective gloves. But Mr Mulholland says: ""We need 60 criminal Nightingale Court buildings. At the moment we have just three."" The CBA says there are around 460 crown courtrooms in England and Wales. Currently around 100 are able to hear trials, though not all are hosting them. The government says its plan will bring on stream another 250 of the existing rooms to hear jury trials by the end of October. The CBA believes that simply will not cut into the backlog. Lawyers believe that the Treasury has long seen justice as a poor relation to health and education in terms of public spending. ""Investing in the criminal justice system is investing in the wealth and prosperity of the country,"" says Mr Mulholland. ""It is an empty and insulting promise for any minister to declare a war on crime if a government can't fund a system that keeps us safe - and ensures crimes are swiftly investigated and cases come to court on time.""

"Conwy is one of the counties in north Wales under local lockdown restrictions People living in 17 areas around Wales are now facing local lockdown restrictions. The city of Bangor in Gwynedd becomes the second place in Wales to face hyper-local restrictions to deal with a massive spike in Covid cases. It is the only part of Gwynedd being told to enforce stricter coronavirus measures. It joins four other areas in north Wales, while 12 areas in south and south-west Wales are in local lockdown. That includes Llanelli in Carmarthenshire, where the hyper-local restrictions were imposed on the town on 25 September. It means more than two million people will be subject to tighter local restrictions. Here's a guide to what you can and can't do. The city of Bangor in Gwynedd has been placed under a local lockdown Under the rules, nobody is able to enter or leave a total of 15 entire council areas, the town of Llanelli, and from 18:00 on Saturday, 10 October, the city of Bangor, without a ""reasonable excuse"". There are a number of excuses listed in the law used to enforce the regulations. These include travelling to school, to give care or to work if you are unable to work from home. You can only go to your place of work and then back home again, although you are allowed to use cafes and shops there if needed, such as to buy lunch. You can travel to buy food and medical supplies, seek medical assistance or go to the vets, and move home. If you are buying essential items and there is no reasonable alternative to using shops within these counties, you can do so. However, in most cases there are expected to be alternative options, even if this involves travelling a bit further than you would normally. Other reasons include: Obtaining supplies for the essential upkeep, maintenance and functioning of the household, or the household of a vulnerable person Children travelling in order to play sport Elite athletic training and competitions To provide or receive emergency assistance To meet a legal obligation, and to access or receive public services To avoid injury or illness or escape a risk of harm Otherwise, the borders are effectively closed. BBC Wales has been told the Welsh Government considers compassionate visits to a loved one as a reasonable excuse, although it is not listed in the legislation. Swansea has been added to the list of local lockdown areas Rules for meeting indoors have changed. Friends and family can no longer meet indoors, while overnight stays are also banned. Soextended householdsare unable to meet, essentially meaning you cannot enter anyone else's home in the affected counties. Meeting people from outside your extended household indoors remains banned in the rest of Wales. All licensed premises across Walesmust stop selling all alcohol at 22:00every day. That includes pubs, cafes, restaurants and supermarkets. You can still go for a drink or a meal indoors, but only with members of your immediate household. You can eat and drink with people from other households outdoors as long as you maintain social distancing. Rules against meeting other people from outside your household indoors still apply in pubs and restaurants. Pubs must stop serving alcohol at 22:00 with 20 minutes to drink-up In shops, yes you have to. People in Walesmust wear face masks in shops, other indoor public spacesand public transport as coronavirus cases rise. UK virus increase 'concerning', says minister Highest reported cases in Wales since June Five bars warned over social distancing measures Yes. Schools, which have only just returned from the summer holidays, will stay open. However,a number of schools across Wales have told pupils to isolateafter positive tests, so any changes will be done on a case-by-case basis. Students can still attend school and colleges No. In a Facebook question and answer video about local lockdown in Caerphilly, Health Minister Vaughan Gething said if residents had booked holidays already they should speak to their providers, explain it would be a breach of the law for them to attend, and seek a refund. Officials would be in touch with package holiday providers and insurers ""to explain to them the seriousness of the position and the risk to them and their business if people from Caerphilly were nevertheless to go on holiday"", he added. Yes, but with restrictions. Marriages and civil partnerships can take still take place under the local lockdowns with small receptions, but guests from outside the area cannot attend the reception. It is the same for funerals and wakes. Those living in the boroughs can attend a wedding ceremony or funeral outside the area, but not a reception or a funeral wake. People can leave if they cannot work from home, to give care, go to school or for essential shopping We don't know exactly. The lockdown measures in each area will be reviewed two weeks after they began, Wales' health minister has said. Vaughan Gething said there were ""cautious reasons"" for optimism, based on how lockdown measures were working in Caerphilly county borough, the first area to be targeted for new restrictions. The county has seen a ""levelling off and a slight reduction in new cases"" thoughlockdown will last at least another week, the Welsh Government announced on Thursday. By the end of that period, Caerphilly would have been in local lockdown for three weeks. Children whose parents do not live in the same home can continue to move between homes, whether inside or outside the affected area, the Welsh Government said. It said parents can continue to rely on wider family for childcare while they are in work, but only when""no other methods are available"",external. Yes. People who breach new laws could face fixed penalty notices of Â£60 for a first offence. Penalties will double with every subsequent offence, to a maximum of Â£1,920. Fixed penalty notices are used as an alternative to prosecution - if a case reached the courts, fines could be unlimited. The rules will be enforced by local authorities as well as the police. A senior officer said Gwent Police was not planning to introduce roadblocks or cordons during lockdown. Ch Supt Mark Hobrough said neighbourhood officers would talk to motorists and visit shops and businesses to ensure everyone was aware of the new rules, with enforcement the ""last objective"". ""We really do want the community to work with us in relation to this to be able to combat this infection and fight it off as soon as possible,"" he said.

"People queue for tests in Southampton People up and down the country have been blocked from getting coronavirus tests in recent days, as appointments were paused with the system struggling to cope. Yet the government says capacity is higher than ever. So what's going on in the UK's testing system? Demand for tests has soared, no-one disputes that. What isn't clear is by how much. It's hard to know exactly - the figures aren't capturing all the people who've tried to book and haven't been able to get a test. The combination of people returning from holiday and children going back to school will have put pressure on the system. And early autumn will have brought other respiratory viruses, with symptoms similar to coronavirus - perhaps especially in children. For many, the message that it's essential to get a test if you have symptoms, will have sunk in. Dozens of people have told the BBC of doing so out of a feeling of civic duty. It's something the government appears to have ""underestimated"" the impact of with the rise in cases also coming sooner than thought, says Sir John Bell, of Oxford University. At the same time, sources have expressed concerns about the ""worried well"" - people applying for tests even if they don't have the relevant symptoms. Health Secretary Matt Hancock has claimed a quarter of people wanting tests do not have symptoms, and so are ineligible. When this was queried, the government said this figure was not a formal count. But it has pointed to reports of whole school year groups being told to get tested, and people asking for tests before and after going on holiday. All you need to know about testing Fact checked: Three government claims on testing UK coronavirus cases up by 3,105 on Tuesday Not enough tests for five months, study predicts There is no shortage of swabs, testing centres and staff. There are almost 400 testing centres in total across the UK, including drive-through and walk-in sites, mobile units set up in hotspots and satellite sites at hospitals and care homes. But getting an appointment at one of these has been a challenge, even though pictures have emerged of sites with hardly any people getting tested. Limited lab capacity means the releasing of new appointments is being held back. That's because once you take a swab, there's a narrow window of time to process it in before it becomes invalid. If the labs can't get to it in time, because they are dealing with yesterday's tests, that swab will be wasted. So when labs get behind, there's no point opening up new appointments to test people. The government says testing capacity - which it defines as how many can be processed in the lab each day - is higher than ever. This is true. The capacity has grown rapidly, with latest figures showing nearly 375,000 tests a day can be processed. But this covers a number of different types of tests. There are four ""pillars"" to the testing programme. The first is hospital testing, which is processed in hospital and university labs and reserved for patients and staff. The second is the testing n the community - and is the element of the system that there is currently so much focus on. The other two are an antibody testing programme, which looks at whether people have had the virus previously, and  a surveillance programme run by the Office for National Statistics. This is considered to be an essential way of keeping track of the spread of the virus. Community testing capacity represents less than half the total. And once we dig down more into this data, it becomes clear why tests have had to be rationed. Nearly all the community testing is processed at one of five mega-labs. Back in August it was clear they were close to capacity - in fact all the testing capacity was used up on 23 August. And this goes to the heart of the problem. These labs were built in super-quick time. Ministers often refer to it as the biggest diagnostic testing expansion in history. That is because the UK had very few diagnostic testing facilities of this type. So it chose to centralise the system at these large labs and has worked with a variety of partners, including private companies and universities, to run them. Prof Gordon Dougan, from the University of Cambridge, says it is not surprising they have run into problems and struggled to increase capacity to keep pace with demand. Despite ""valiant efforts, the system is not robust enough"" and is vulnerable to failure at multiple levels from sourcing equipment to finding the right staff, he says. It is understood that one of the biggest limitations is hiring enough qualified people to carry out the tests. YOUR QUESTIONS:We answer your queries THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters LOCAL LOCKDOWNS:What happens if you have one? TEST AND TRACE:How does it work? FURLOUGH:What happens when the scheme ends? This has become a particular issue as academics and post-graduate students have returned to their usual roles. Labs have been unable to offer academic staff contracts. More experienced staff have had to go back to their institutions. This has led to Prime Minister Boris Johnson writing letters to universities asking them to lend their staff and students for a little longer. It's not clear how many, if any, have agreed to this. In order to process more tests, labs will need more space, machines and people. This is happening, but it seems not fast enough to keep up with demand. Lab capacity is being increased. A sixth mega-lab in Newport is in the process of opening. A seventh near Loughborough will follow suit in the coming weeks. This should have a big impact on capacity. But meanwhile, the government has said it will have to prioritise - that means making sure hospitals, care homes and areas with outbreaks can get access to testing. Even when these new labs are fully up and running, there are concerns demand will still outstrip supply. Cases of coronavirus and other respiratory illnesses are going up, so it seems inevitable more people will be seeking access to tests. An analysis by Health Data Research UK warned that if just 80% of people with annual coughs and fevers applied for a test, capacity could be exceeded for the whole winter.

"People requiring A&E will be urged to book an appointment through NHS 111 under a trial in parts of England. The aim is to direct patients to the most clinically-appropriate service and to help reduce pressure on emergency departments as staff battle winter pressures, such as coronavirus and flu. The pilots are live in Cornwall, Portsmouth, Hampshire and Blackpool and have just begun in Warrington. If they are successful, they could be rolled out to all trusts in December. However, people with a life-threatening condition should still call 999. Under the new changes, patients will still be able to seek help at A&E without an appointment, but officials say they are likely to end up waiting longer than those who have gone through 111. More NHS 111 call handlers are being brought in to take on the additional workload, alongside extra clinicians, the Department of Health and Social Care said. A campaign called Help Us Help You will launch later in the year to urge people to use the new service. The government has also pledged an extra Â£150m of funding to expand and upgrade 25 more A&Es to reduce overcrowding and improve infection control ahead of winter. This was in addition to theÂ£300m announcedfor a number of trusts to upgrade their facilities, it said. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: ""During the peak of the pandemic we saw millions of people using NHS 111 to get the best possible advice on Covid-19, and other urgent NHS services. ""These pilots will build on this and test whether we can deliver quicker access to the right care, provide a better service for the public and ensure our dedicated NHS staff aren't overwhelmed."" A&E visits in England down to record low People told to phone ahead before going to A&E Hospital plea after 100 go to A&E for virus test This trial scheme, which seems likely to be adopted at hospitals across England, will see big changes to what people are familiar with at A&E. People who are not seriously ill will be actively discouraged from arriving at emergency departments without an appointment. They won't be turned away, but they have been warned there could be even longer waits than before. On the other hand, those who have called NHS 111 first and been directed to A&E will get a confirmed time to see an appropriate clinician. They could just as easily be directed to an urgent treatment centre or a mental health professional. There's the understandable aim of cutting unnecessary visits, so reducing overcrowding in waiting areas at a time when hospitals want to reduce the risk of Covid-19 transmission. But for the plan to work, a big public information campaign is required and people will need to have confidence they can get through quickly to an NHS 111 call handler when they need to. Data from the Department for Health and Social Care suggests there are 14.4 million A&E attendances in England that have not gone through NHS 111, a GP or via an ambulance. It said 2.1 million attendances do not result in admission or treatment. Chris Hopson, the chief executive of NHS Providers, said trusts will welcome the funding, as it will ""enable them to provide better care for their patients this winter"", adding that the 111 proposals were the ""right approach"". Caroline Abrahams, charity director at Age UK, said the 111 scheme could have advantages for many older people, including avoiding waiting in crowded A&Es. ""However, it is important to stress that older people who have difficulty using the phone will not be turned away if they go straight to A&E as before,"" she said. YOUR QUESTIONS:We answer your queries THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters LOCAL LOCKDOWNS:What happens if you have one? TEST AND TRACE:How does it work? FURLOUGH:What happens when the scheme ends? The government also announced a consultation on new targets for waiting times in A&E is being launched as ministers prepare to scrap the current four-hour target. Dr Katherine Henderson, president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, said: ""Expansion of NHS 111 will help patients to be seen more quickly by the service most appropriate to their needs. ""We are pleased to have reached the consultation phase of how A&E performance is measured with a focus on the safe, timely care of the very sickest patients, and look forward to the publication of the proposals.""

"The charity hopes to reopen Tedworth House in Wiltshire as a recovery centre for wounded, injured and sick service veterans Military charity Help for Heroes says 142 staff roles are at risk, as its income has dropped by nearly a third during the pandemic. The charity, which supports wounded veterans and their families, says there are likely to be about 80 redundancies. It relies on donations for 97% of its funding, but its fundraisers have been cancelled or postponed since March. Charity chief Melanie Waters said: ""These tough decisions have been made to protect the future of the charity."" Three Help for Heroes recovery centres - in Yorkshire, Devon and Essex - will remain closed indefinitely as Help for Heroes focuses on face-to-face community and online-based support. The charity said demand for its services rose by 33% during May and June - compared to the same period last year - as the consequences of the national lockdown impacted on veterans' mental health. Requests for help with physical conditions also increased by nearly a third over the same period. Meanwhile, the charity - which furloughed 130 staff at the start of the pandemic - said it anticipates funding will remain down by around a third for the foreseeable future, as the economy struggles to recover. Ms Waters said a major restructure was the only way the charity could continue with its work. ""In 2007, we made a promise on behalf of the nation to provide lifetime support to wounded veterans, and their families, and we are striving to keep that promise,"" she saidin a statement on their website.,external ""The crisis has had a devastating impact on the whole UK charity sector, with lasting consequences, and it has hit us hard."" The charity said it was working closely with the Ministry of Defence ""to provide core recovery activities for wounded, injured or sick service personnel"" and hoped to reopen its Tedworth House recovery centre in Wiltshire, with social distancing measures in place - as well as their community office in Wales. Last year, the charity - which was set up in 2007 by former Army Captain Bryn Parry and wife Emma - raised around Â£27m. ""We remain absolutely committed to our wounded and theirâ¯families and will continue fighting for, and changing the lives of, those we support for as long as they need it,"" said Ms Waters.
