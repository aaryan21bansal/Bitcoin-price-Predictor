" By Jonathan Head By Jonathan Head Soon the full moon will rise out of the sea, illuminating the soft, almost pure white sand. Staff at the bars, most of them Burmese migrants, lay out chairs and tables on the beach, to the pulsing beat of half a dozen sound systems. Only a handful of customers come to eat and drink. It’s a peaceful, but cheerless scene. Just six months ago there would have been thousands of revellers here, drawn from all over the globe to one of the world’s most famous parties. The Full Moon Party grew from just a few travellers who, around 30 years ago, gravitated to the island in search of quieter beaches, into something more akin to a night out on the party island of Ibiza - DJs the length of the beach, buckets of cocktails; more than 30,000 tourists at peak times like New Year. Guidebooks such as The Lonely Planet had begun to recommend that travellers wanting to explore the island’s natural beauty should look beyond the Full Moon gatherings and avoid peak party periods. In March the local authorities ordered the parties to stop. There are plenty of legends about the origins of the Full Moon Party. By some accounts, it was started by a group of travellers disillusioned with rapid modernisation on the larger island of Koh Samui. The story goes that they took a boat across to Koh Pha Ngan in 1988, with just a crate of beer and substantial supplies of magic mushrooms - though some versions suggest there were earlier gatherings. There was no electricity on the island then, and the travellers danced the night away in the light of the full moon. It was a quest for an untouched tropical retreat which would later be immortalised in Alex Garland’s best-selling novel, The Beach. According to another account, the very first party was held at Paradise Bungalows owned by Sutti Kursakul at the southern end of the beach, also in 1988. Ellie Housego, from Milton Keynes in the UK, is staying on Haad Rin and is a big fan of the Full Moon Party - she went to three with her sister Amy last year. “It’s a must-do experience for backpackers… especially at New Year. Everyone’s dancing, everyone’s going crazy, everyone’s drinking, and then the fireworks start, and everyone just stops to look at them…  I loved it...” says the 25-year-old. “If you’re with friends, you can have the best time… especially if you’re still on the beach at six in the morning, and the sun comes up – it’s magical.” And it plays an important economic role on the island too. It attracts more than half of the more than one million visitors who come to Koh Pha Ngan every year. It supports thousands of jobs and small businesses, from hotel staff to the notorious alcohol bucket stalls. But it has a darker side. The profits from selling drugs and alcohol have attracted criminal gangs, with violence occasionally spilling over to the party. In January 2013, 22 year-old British man Stephen Ashton was killed by a stray bullet fired during a gang dispute. Deaths from drowning are not uncommon, and the British Foreign Office travel advice warns women to be aware of the risk of sexual assault. Even though these incidents have been rare, the spectacle of thousands of party-goers, some roaring drunk, and the unsightly rubbish left behind, has always jarred with the image of an unspoiled tropical idyll projected by Thailand’s tourist authorities and many residents. He admits they have been good for business but says they had extended to last five days at a stretch, changing the atmosphere on the beach. “People came just to experience the party, and not the community, the nature, and other things the island has to offer.” Writing on his resort’s website, he goes further. “It looks like Full Moon Party will be dead forever anyway and we hope it stays dead. Full Moon Party is the saddest thing that ever happened to Haad Rin and it brought in nothing but destruction.” He is optimistic that an end to the party could herald a change on the island. “Covid has really delivered a reset button,” he tells me. “At some point the Full Moon Party was going to fail anyway, and it just so happens that Covid pushed that reset button hard. A lot of people are going to suffer, but this is a sort of watershed for a change, not just for Haad Rin but for the entire island.” Mark has made his choice. From now on, he says, he will focus on long-staying guests. He is making much less money, but says he is much happier. Credit: Noom Coral Credit: Noom Coral She arrived in March to visit her son Victor, who has been coming to Koh Pha Ngan for the past seven years. She decided to stay on as Covid-19 lockdowns were imposed in the UK and in Thailand, and now she wants to live on the island. “I have not been to anywhere else in Thailand. I know nothing of the country really. Somehow this place has given me a desire to stay. I feel I have been presented with an opportunity to make a life-changing decision.” And in order to look after guests like Christine, Mark has kept all of his staff. For Lek Phyo Wai, this has been a lifeline. Like most workers in Koh Pha Ngan’s resorts and restaurants, Lek, 33, is Burmese. She followed a well-worn path to Thailand in search of work when she was just a teenager. She says most of her fellow Burmese workers have now lost their jobs and had to go home. “Some tried to find other jobs like construction, but after four to five months, there are barely any left. So most of them have now gone back to Myanmar.” But Lek hopes she will be able to stay on long term, even though it means being separated from her five-year-old daughter - looked after by her mother back home. Fewer than 60 people have died from the disease, and for the past four months Thailand has recorded just a handful of new cases. But the cost to a country dependent on tourism for as much as 20% of its economy has been high. The World Bank has forecast job losses of more than eight million this year. Thai economists believe the economy will contract by as much as 10%. Hoteliers have been pleading with the government to reopen the country to foreign visitors, but it has so far been unwilling to do so, buoyed by polls that suggest much of the Thai public believes keeping Covid-19 out is more important than letting tourists in. There are plans to allow very limited numbers of tourists - a maximum of just 1,200 a month on special charter flights and from designated countries, who must be willing to endure at least 14 days in quarantine. But these small numbers will not do much to help. One plan is to adapt parts of the island of Phuket to be so-called ‘immunised communities’, which can accommodate foreign visitors in comfort by the beach while they are quarantined, and to ensure any Covid-19 infections are contained on the island. Even when Thailand does eventually open up further, limited and pricier flights, and likely restrictions on which parts of the country you can visit, will keep the backpackers away. Source: Urban Design and Development Center Source: Urban Design and Development Center Dani Viriyanont, who ran a bar on Haad Rin for a year, says now is the time to change Haad Rin’s image. “The water is beautiful, the beach is clean right now. I would market it to families. Backpackers come for just four days, destroy everything, don't care about the environment. They just want to get drunk, and have a good time. Now we could convert ourselves to eco-friendly travelling. That's the positive side of Covid.” Bettina Kahlert, a German yoga instructor and spiritual healer who has lived on Koh Pha Ngan for eight years, believes the island’s future is probably in the wellness and health industry. “I think there's a big potential here because it’s a small island, but big enough to accommodate that. Yes, there are a lot of crazies on the island – I am one of them. That's what makes it so beautiful. “I believe that if you can control the number of people coming in, that would work.” The Thai government is saying all the right things about making tourism more sustainable when they rebuild after Covid-19. Last year the Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT) celebrated bringing in nearly 40 million foreign visitors, quadruple the number 20 years ago. Now the TAT says Thailand should never go back to 40 million a year. They too are talking about upmarket alternatives like medical and eco-tourism. There is no talk of bringing back the backpackers. For 60 years Thailand has allowed tourist development to spread almost uncontrolled across the country. It was a spectacular success - one emulated by many other countries - but it came at huge cost to the natural environment, with the sheer weight of numbers of visitors threatening to overwhelm the sights they had come to see. Turning its back on this model of tourism would be a huge step for Thailand.

"Fishing remains one of the key sticking points of negotiations Boris Johnson has told the French president the UK wants to ""explore every avenue"" to secure a post-Brexit trade deal with the EU, days before the PM's self-imposed deadline. Mr Johnson told Emmanuel Macron ""intensive talks"" were needed to ""bridge significant gaps"" remaining across the negotiating table. A disagreement over fishing has been one major sticking point of talks. Informal discussions will continue in Brussels next week. The UK left the EU on 31 January and entered a transition period until the end of the year - with all the rules, regulations and budget payments staying the same until then. Both sides are now trying to negotiate a trade deal - which would decide, among other things, the tariffs (taxes) applied when buying and selling each other's goods. A No 10 spokesman said in the call on Saturday, Mr Johnson ""confirmed the UK's commitment to exploring every avenue to reach an agreement"". ""He underlined that a deal was better for both sides, but also that the UK was prepared to end the transition period on Australia-style terms if an agreement could not be found,"" the spokesman added. An ""Australia-style"" agreement means trading onWorld Trade Organization terms, with no specific free trade deal. It comes after Downing Street saidthe latest round of discussionsbetween chief negotiators Michel Barnier and Lord Frost, in London, had been ""useful"". 'Put cards on table' over trade deal, says EU PM and EU chief 'agree importance of Brexit deal' One thing that both sides have agreed on is that a deal needs to be struck in October to ensure sufficient time for ratification, before the end of the transition period. But negotiators are unlikely to get until the end of the month. Mr Johnson has previously said he wants to agree a free trade deal by the time of an EU summit in the Belgian capital - which is next week, on Thursday 15 October. Mr Johnson has said the two sides should ""move on""if nothing is agreed by then. The No 10 spokesman said that during the phone call, ""the prime minister emphasised that progress must be made in the coming days to bridge the significant gaps, notably in the areas of fisheries and the level playing field"". The issue of fishing is one that has cropped up time and again throughout talks. The UK wants full access to EU markets to sell its fish, but in return the EU wants full access for its fishing fleets to UK waters - which the UK does not want to provide. The ""level playing field"" is the idea that there should be measures in place to ensure businesses on one side of the deal do not have an unfair advantage over their competitors on the other side. All trade agreements have such measures, but the EU wants the UK to stick particularly closely to EU rules on things like workers' rights, environmental regulations and particularly state aid - that is, financial assistance given by government to businesses. The UK, on the other hand, says the whole point of Brexit was to break free from following common rules. What are the sticking points in Brexit trade talks? If no deal is reached, the UK and EU would do business under World Trade Organization rules, which would mean tariffs on goods. The UK government has started referring to this outcome as an ""Australia-style deal"" because it would mean the UK trading with the EU in roughly the same way Australia does. But, as our Reality Check correspondent Chris Morris points out, it is important to consider geography. Australia is on the other side of the world, so does not rely on the EU for the operation of just-in-time supply chains in sectors such as cars, pharmaceuticals and food. Border checks and delays therefore have far less impact on EU-Australia trade than they would on EU-UK trade. In other words, going to WTO rules for trade with the EU - without any other deals in place - would be a huge change.

"Another member of staff at Glasgow's Barlinnie prison has tested positive for coronavirus. Two inmates and five staff at the jail have already been confirmed as having Covid-19. On Saturday the Scottish Prison Service said more than 250 inmates were put into lockdown, with 12 staff from the jail's A hall also isolating. All visits to A hall have been suspended until at least the end of October. An SPS spokesman said the rest of the prison was not affected by the outbreak or visiting ban. He added that contact tracing was being carried out for staff members. Earlier this year, the Scottish government approved new early release regulations to help the prison system cope with Covid cases. The move, designed to free up more cells for single-use occupancy, couldallow up to 450 inmates to get out of prison early. But only those sentenced to 18 months or less and with 90 days or less left to serve are potentially eligible. Some serious offences are excluded.

"Transgender women are now unable to play for women's teams World Rugby's decision to prevent transgender women from competing at the highest levels of the women's game has provoked a mixed reaction. The move has been criticised by LGBT charity Stonewall, while some women's rights and gay rights campaigners have welcomed the decision. New guidelines published on Friday""do not recommend""transgender women play contact rugby ""on safety grounds"". National unions can be flexible in their application of the guidelines at community level. Stonewall says it is ""deeply disappointed"" with the decision, but Fair Play for Women - which ""works to protect the rights of women and girls in the UK"" - thanked World Rugby ""for not trading away women's safety"". ""The proposals were based on hypothetical data modelling that has little relevance to the questions of fairness and safety in rugby that the policy review sought to address,"" said Stonewall chief executive Nancy Kelley. ""Important policies like this should be based on robust, relevant evidence and work closely with trans people playing in the sport."" However, Bev Jackson, co-founder of the LGB Alliance, said the organisation ""applauds World Rugby for conducting a thorough, evidence-based study and making a decision on that basis to protect safety in women's rugby. We are very pleased that they resisted political pressure and kept to scientific facts. Many lesbians play this sport and they are enormously relieved."" She added that ""judging by the reactions we have received, a great many LGB people and indeed many trans people think this was the right decision"". Dr Nicola Williams, director of Fair Play For Women, said: ""World Rugby have taken a transparent and evidence-based approach and we welcome their decision to prioritise safety and fairness for elite female players. ""We now look to Rugby's national governing bodies to follow their lead and guarantee the same protections for the thousands of women and girls who play at club level."" Transgender men remain permitted to play men's contact rugby union, but the sport's governing body says a review of its existing guidelines had concluded that ""safety and fairness cannot presently be assured for women competing against trans women in contact rugby"". World Rugby chairman Bill Beaumont said: ""We recognise that the science continues to evolve and we are committed to regularly reviewing these guidelines, always seeking to be inclusive."" Speaking to BBC Sport in August, Grace McKenzie, a trans woman who plays for Golden Gate Women's rugby club in San Francisco, said she was worried ""that other sporting federations will look at World Rugby and begin to second-guess the existing science that supports trans women's inclusion in sport, and begin to make policies based out of a place of fear instead of a place of logic and reason"". ""I want to be able to participate fully with my team and in the sport that I love. I think that there is still a path forward to allow us to do that,"" she said. Former Great Britain swimmer Sharron Davies, who has beenvocal on the issue of trans women in elite sport,also welcomed World Rugby's decision. The 57-year-old, a silver medallist at the 1980 Olympics, posted on social media: ""If we, as a fair society, want equal opportunities for females to medals, team places, safe sport and scholarships, with all the associations, rewards and careers, sport must be based on biological sex.""

"Whoever had the book appears to have looked after it as the council said it was ""pristine"" An overdue library book has been returned nearly 60 years late. It was left in Middlesbrough Central Library's returns box this week but was due back in December, 1962.

The fine would have been more than Â£500 but charges have been suspended during the pandemic and there would be ""no questions asked"", a council spokesperson said. The identity of the borrower is not known. Librarian David Harrington said they were ""really grateful to the anonymous person who returned this book to us as it will be added back to our stock and placed in the Reference Library for future generations to enjoy"".

"This video can not be played Andy Burnham: ""This package is insufficient to protect our communities"" People will not be surrendered to hardship, Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham has said, as the government prepares to bring in new restrictions in England to slow the spread of Covid. Labour mayor Mr Burnham said the chancellor's pledge to pay two-thirds of workers' wages if restrictions force UK firms to close was ""insufficient"". The government is planning to bring in a three-tier local lockdown system. It could mean tougher rules in parts of northern England and the Midlands. Liverpool, where there are currently 600 cases per 100,000 people, is expected to be placed under the most severe set of restrictions, with all the city's pubs forced to close. On Saturday, 15,166 people in the UK were reported to have tested positive for coronavirus - an increase of 1,302 on Friday's figure - according to thegovernment's dashboard,external. There were a further 81 deaths - a decrease of six on Friday. In a joint press conference with other mayors from northern England, Mr Burnham said negotiations about the lockdown in the North of England were ongoing but he was told by a ""senior figure in Number 10"" that the proposed financial help was ""non-negotiable"". ""I'm angry actually about being told the effect on people's lives is non-negotiable,"" he said. He added that the chancellor's plans would hit the lowest paid - those on minimum or living wages. ""These people can't choose to pay two-thirds of their rent or two-thirds of their bills,"" he said. ""To accept the chancellor's package would be to surrender our residents to hardship and our businesses to failure or collapse - and we are not prepared to do that,"" he added. What are the Covid restrictions where I live? How many cases are there in my area? What is changing after furlough? Will I be paid under the Job Support Scheme? Referring to the chancellor's previous furlough scheme, Steve Rotheram, the Labour mayor of Liverpool City Region, said: ""If 80% was right in March, it's right now. You can't do lockdown for the North on the cheap."" He said if the new restrictions were as severe as during the national lockdown in March, a similar sort of package was needed. Mr Burnham said he wanted the minimum package to be 80% of workers' wages, in line with the initial national furlough scheme. Mr Burnham and Mr Rotheram, together with mayors from Sheffield and North of Tyne, have written to all MPs in northern England asking them to call for a separate vote in Parliament on the chancellor's latest package - and to reject it. Those who have long argued that mayors provide the best model for the leadership of a city often point to what they see as their principal advantage: a widely known figurehead locally, who can stand up for you nationally. Today, we have seen that in action. Party politics plays something of a role here: all four of the mayors making their case today represent the Labour Party, all four have sharpening critiques of the Conservative government at Westminster. But, at the same time, about 30 Tory MPs from northern England have got together. They are the intriguingly named Northern Research Group of Conservative MPs. If that name sounds a little bit familiar, maybe you're remembering the European Research Group of Conservative MPs, who proved to be a never ending political migraine for former Prime Minister Theresa May. They're promising they're not about ""giving government a bad time"". But they pointedly observe: ""We don't form a government unless we win the North."" Ministers counter that financial support for the North of England and elsewhere is unprecedented and wide ranging. The big question now is what happens on Monday when the prime minister addresses the Commons: what do the restrictions look like, what support will be offered, and to whom? Mr Burnham said he would not rule out a legal challenge and did not accept hospitality workers were ""somehow second-class citizens"". ""This goes to the heart of everything we care about - the north of England is staring the most dangerous winter for years right in the face. The chancellor's announcementthat the government would pay two-thirds of employees' wages for six months from next month if their firm is forced to shut by law because of coronavirus restrictions came on Friday afternoon. In response to the criticism from some mayors of the scheme, a government spokesman said: ""Ministers are continuing to work closely with local leaders on how we can combat coronavirus together. ""We will keep all financial support under review to support businesses who need it most and protect jobs over the coming weeks and months."" SOCIAL DISTANCING:How have rules on meeting friends changed? FACE MASKS:When do I need to wear one? TESTING:How do I get a virus test? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? Under the new restrictions, expected to be detailed by the prime minister in a statement to MPs on Monday, pubs and restaurants could be closed in areas where some of the highest numbers of cases are occurring and a ban on overnight stays is also being considered. A senior adviser to Boris Johnson has written to MPs representing constituencies in the North of England to confirm that some areas were ""very likely"" to be placed under ""further restrictions"". In the letter seen by the BBC,Sir Edward Lister said ministers would hold discussionswith local authorities in the region during the weekend. It has been suggested that the most severe measures - imposed for areas in tier three - would be agreed with local leaders in advance. However, on Saturday, northern mayors said there had been conversations with Downing Street but little consultation. The details of each tier, including the level of infection at which an area would qualify for it and the nature of the restrictions, are being debated this weekend. It comes as the British Medical Association (BMA), a doctor's trade union, has called on the government to bring in clearer and stronger measures to stem the spread of Covid-19. It is recommending actions including modifying the current ""rule of six"" so only two households can meet and for the wearing of face masks to be made mandatory in all offices and workplaces.

"Iga Swiatek had only played once previously in the Roland Garros main draw, losing to Simona Halep in the fourth round last year Polish teenager Iga Swiatek completed a stunning rise by becoming the lowest-ranked woman to win the French Open after beating American Sofia Kenin. Swiatek, 19, is a former junior Wimbledon champion but the world number 54's rise to Roland Garros history has been swift and surprising. She showed few nerves to beat fourth seed Kenin 6-4 6-1, lifting the trophy without losing a set in the tournament. ""I don't know what is going on, I'm so happy,"" a smiling Swiatek said. Swiatek is the first player from Poland to win a Grand Slam singles title. She is the youngest French Open women's champion since Monica Seles lifted the Coupe Suzanne Lenglen in 1992. ""It is crazy. Two years ago I won a junior Grand Slam and now I'm here,"" added Swiatek, who was laughing before her voice cracked with emotion. ""It feels like such a short time. I'm so overwhelmed."" Swiatek dropped to her haunches and cupped her mouth in disbelief after cracking a forehand winner on her first match point. After asking the umpire for permission, she ran across Court Philippe Chatrier to find her nearest and dearest, eventually being pointed in the right direction to run up to her support team and family in the players' box. Swiatek celebrated with her family and friends in the Chatrier stands after winning Born 31 May 2001 in Warsaw, Poland Father is former rower Tomasz Swiatek, who competed at the 1988 Olympics She loves rock/guitar-led music including AC/DC, Pink Floyd and Guns N' Roses She won the Wimbledon junior title in 2018 and the French Open girls' doubles alongside Caty McNally in the same year Said earlier in the tournament she might step away from the tour to go to university Employs a sports psychologist, Daria Abramowicz, to travel with her on tour The women's game has long been unpredictable and few would have backed Swiatek, even those who were already aware of her huge potential, to win Roland Garros. The teenager is the ninth woman to win her maiden Grand Slam in the past 14 major tournaments. But from the moment she shocked Romanian top seed Simona Halep in the fourth round, more began to believe it would be the fearless Swiatek who lifted the trophy on Saturday. As well as Halep, Swiatek has also beaten Czech 2019 runner-up Marketa Vondrousova and now Kenin as her ability to hit powerfully and precisely off either flank paid dividends. One question mark going into the final was whether she would not - in her words - ""choke"". She did not seem to think she would and so it proved. The magnitude of the occasion did not faze her as she raced into an early 3-0 lead and, after Kenin fought back to level, she regained control to win the first set. Kenin struggled to handle Swiatek's heavy and free hitting, with the Pole's confidence increasing as the match went on. Another sign of Swiatek's calmness was the way she casually waved to Polish fans and practised a few serves when Kenin took a medical timeout for treatment on a heavily-strapped left thigh after the third game of the second set. Soon it was back to business, though. Swiatek ruthlessly won 16 of the next 19 points from when Kenin returned as she became the first woman to win the title without dropping a set since Belgium's Justine Henin in 2007. ""I was just mentally consistent. I just wanted to play aggressive as in previous rounds,"" said Swiatek, who hit 25 winners and made 13 unforced errors. ""It was really stressful for me, so kind of hard. I don't know what made the difference. I won the match point and that is important enough. ""It had to be like that that another underdog won a Grand Slam in women's tennis. It is so often right now that it is crazy."" Kenin looked close to tears in the second set, where she also needed treatment on a thigh injury While Kenin was the higher ranked player and had won her maiden Grand Slam title at the Australian Open in January, it is easy to forget the 21-year-old's own rapid progress in light of Swiatek's achievement. The American said she ""hated"" clay courts up to last year, when she announced her arrival at Roland Garros by beating 23-time major champion Serena Williams in the third round. There did not seem to be too much she liked about the surface when her preparation for the French Open started and finished with a 6-0 6-0 humbling by former world number one Victoria Azarenka in Rome last month. But the feisty New Yorker, who has unashamedly told how winning is what she loves most about the sport, has repeatedly shown how she will never back down from a challenge and proved it again in Paris by reaching the final. This was one step too far for Kenin, however, who could not reach her best level as a total of 23 unforced errors contributed to her defeat. While she could not become the first woman aged 21 or under to win two majors in the same season since Henin and Williams in 2003, she will reflect on a wonderful year where she has emerged as one of the biggest talents in the game. ""I'm not going to use this as an excuse, but my leg obviously was not the best,"" said Kenin, who is set to move up to fourth in the world. ""After the first set I just felt it was so tight, I couldn't move. That's why I had to call the trainer. It just got worse."" Three-time Grand Slam champion Naomi Osaka, who is friends with Swiatek, led the congratulations on social media... Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Transgender women are now unable to play for women's teams World Rugby's decision to prevent transgender women from competing at the highest levels of the women's game has provoked a mixed reaction. The move has been criticised by LGBT charity Stonewall, while some women's rights and gay rights campaigners have welcomed the decision. New guidelines published on Friday""do not recommend""transgender women play contact rugby ""on safety grounds"". National unions can be flexible in their application of the guidelines at community level. Stonewall says it is ""deeply disappointed"" with the decision, but Fair Play for Women - which ""works to protect the rights of women and girls in the UK"" - thanked World Rugby ""for not trading away women's safety"". ""The proposals were based on hypothetical data modelling that has little relevance to the questions of fairness and safety in rugby that the policy review sought to address,"" said Stonewall chief executive Nancy Kelley. ""Important policies like this should be based on robust, relevant evidence and work closely with trans people playing in the sport."" However, Bev Jackson, co-founder of the LGB Alliance, said the organisation ""applauds World Rugby for conducting a thorough, evidence-based study and making a decision on that basis to protect safety in women's rugby. We are very pleased that they resisted political pressure and kept to scientific facts. Many lesbians play this sport and they are enormously relieved."" She added that ""judging by the reactions we have received, a great many LGB people and indeed many trans people think this was the right decision"". Dr Nicola Williams, director of Fair Play For Women, said: ""World Rugby have taken a transparent and evidence-based approach and we welcome their decision to prioritise safety and fairness for elite female players. ""We now look to Rugby's national governing bodies to follow their lead and guarantee the same protections for the thousands of women and girls who play at club level."" Transgender men remain permitted to play men's contact rugby union, but the sport's governing body says a review of its existing guidelines had concluded that ""safety and fairness cannot presently be assured for women competing against trans women in contact rugby"". World Rugby chairman Bill Beaumont said: ""We recognise that the science continues to evolve and we are committed to regularly reviewing these guidelines, always seeking to be inclusive."" Speaking to BBC Sport in August, Grace McKenzie, a trans woman who plays for Golden Gate Women's rugby club in San Francisco, said she was worried ""that other sporting federations will look at World Rugby and begin to second-guess the existing science that supports trans women's inclusion in sport, and begin to make policies based out of a place of fear instead of a place of logic and reason"". ""I want to be able to participate fully with my team and in the sport that I love. I think that there is still a path forward to allow us to do that,"" she said. Former Great Britain swimmer Sharron Davies, who has beenvocal on the issue of trans women in elite sport,also welcomed World Rugby's decision. The 57-year-old, a silver medallist at the 1980 Olympics, posted on social media: ""If we, as a fair society, want equal opportunities for females to medals, team places, safe sport and scholarships, with all the associations, rewards and careers, sport must be based on biological sex.""

"Leon and Nikita are brothers who need a ""retirement home"" at the age of 21 Two elderly feline fellows are hoping to find a new owner, at the grand old age of 21. The cats, Leon and Nikita, are ""bonded"" brothers, meaning they do everything together, and are very affectionate, the Northamptonshire RSPCA branch said. The average age a domestic cat lives to is about 14, but the oldest on record lived to an amazing 38 years. The black cats now need a home to live out their twilight years, as theNorthampton Chronicle reported,external. ""Poor Leon and Nikita find themselves in our care at the grand age of 21,"" the RSPCA wrote on itsbranch website,external. ""They are bonded brothers and were signed over to be rehomed as they were not coping with family life,"" Michelle Billingham, from the Northamptonshire adoptions team, said. This ""affectionate pair... enjoy chin tickles and human company"" and would need a quiet ""retirement home"" with no children. Nikita's fur was very matted when he arrived at the RSPCA branch last month The brothers have been together their entire lives, and came into the branch ""through no fault of their own"", Ms Billingham told the BBC. Despite their age - which could equate to more than 100 years each in human terms - they are in ""fairly good health"", although Nikita has been diagnosed with hyperthyroidism. ""He will need blood tests over the next few weeks or months at our vet's to check how he is responding to medication,"" said the RSPCA, which will offer support to a new owner within the county. A report by the Royal Veterinary College states the average life expectancy of a domestic cat in the UK is about 14 years, although many can live far longer. Elderly gentleman Leon will need to be rehomed with his brother According toGuinness World Records,externalCreme Puff was the oldest cat on record, and lived to the age of 38.

"Front-line workers and volunteers who contributed to the response to Covid-19 dominate the Queen's Birthday Honours. Footballer Marcus Rashford and fitness coach Joe Wicks are also recognised for their efforts during the pandemic, becoming MBEs on the delayed list. TV chef Mary Berry and actress Maureen Lipman are made dames, while actor David Suchet and veteran entertainer Tommy Steele are both knighted.

Honours for Mary Berry and Dizzee Rascal Rashford becomes MBE in birthday honours Billionaire brothers honoured after Asda takeover Knighthood for Grange Hill creator Phil Redmond Lorraine Kelly and Eve Muirhead honoured Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the recipients of this year's honours were ""a testament to the sort of country we are - caring, compassionate and resolute in the face of a global pandemic"". ""The hard work and dedication of these local, often unsung heroes has helped carry us through,"" he added. England player Rashford, whose award came for services to vulnerable children in the UK during the coronavirus epidemic, said becoming an MBE sounded ""a little bit strange but obviously I feel honoured"". The 22-year-old Manchester United forward successfully campaignedto extend free school meals over the summerafter pressing the government into a U-turn on the issue. This video can not be played Marcus Rashford said he felt ""honoured"" to be given an MBE ""Hopefully it inspires more people to do good things,"" Rashford said. ""It's a nice moment for me personally but I feel like I'm still at the beginning of the journey that I set out to try to achieve."" But he said his main focus now was on having the scheme extended. ""What I'd like to do, now that I'm in this position, is just speak directly to the prime minister and really ask for the vouchers to be extended at least until October half term, because I think that's what the families need,"" he said. Wicks, also known as The Body Coach, became the UK's PE teacher during the national lockdown by running free online classes every weekday for children and parents to keep fit. ""If you met me as a little boy you'd have thought 'he's not going to go anywhere, he's not going to do anything great', he said.

However, it is the ""unsung heroes"" of the pandemic, such as NHS and social care staff, fundraisers, shop workers, and drivers - of public transport and deliveries, which make up the majority of the 414 names who have been awarded for their ""exceptional contributions"" during the outbreak. Felicia Kwaku, from Islington, north London, who has been a nurse for 30 years, is among the health and social care workers which make up 14% of the total 1,495 recipients on the list. The 52-year-old, who is associate director of nursing at Kings College NHS Foundation Trust, championed the cause of nurses from a Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) background, who were being disproportionately affected by the virus. She said it was an ""absolute honour"" to be made an OBE for services to nursing, adding that it wasn't just for her but also the ""nurses I work with and the ones who lost their lives"". Felicia Kwaku was awarded an OBE for services to nursing Fundraisers are also celebrated after millions of pounds were raised for charity during the crisis. Dabirul Islam Choudhury, from Bow, east London, said he was ""proud"" after becoming an OBE for raising more than Â£420,000 for coronavirus relief and said he ""thanked everybody from the bottom of my heart"". Mr Choudhury, who turns 101 in January, said he was inspired by another 100-year-old, Captain Sir Tom Moore, to walk almost 1,000 laps of his garden while fasting for Ramadan. Dabirul Islam Choudhury, 100, was made an OBE for his fundraising efforts Jay Flynn, whose weekly online quizzes became a lockdown phenomenon, gets an MBE Online quizzes became a feature of lockdown for many but for Jay Flynn, 38, from Darwen, Lancashire, his virtual pub quiz has seen him awarded an MBE for charitable service.

The huge voluntary effort across the country has also been reflected, with 72% of recipients awarded for their work in the community, including those who supplied free meals to those who were shielding, volunteering to help those at risk, and delivering care packages to NHS frontline workers. This video can not be played Mary Berry on damehood: ""I'll still be the same person"" Glasgow restaurant owner David Maguire, 62, who gave out free meals to NHS workers and vulnerable people, said it was a team effort but he was ""really pleased"" to have been made an MBE. The Cabinet Office said this year's list was the first to have 11% of recipients under 30, with 16-year-old Theodore Wride the youngest. He is awarded the BEM for service to his community in Sunderland during the pandemic. Several experts working in the science, health and pharmaceutical field have also been recognised for their efforts during the pandemic, including Tim Spector, professor of genetic epidemiology at King's College London, who leads the Covid Symptom Study app. He is made an OBE.

David Suchet and Maureen Lipman have been recognised for their careers in acting Meanwhile, another national treasure, Sir David Attenborough, who was knighted in 1985, has been given an upgrade - receiving a Knight Grand Cross in the diplomatic list announced by the Foreign Office. The award, for service in a foreign country, is awarded for the 94-year-old's contribution to broadcasting and conservation. Two actors whose careers have spanned more than 50 years are both recognised. Coronation Street star Maureen Lipman, 74, gets a damehood, while David Suchet, best known for playing Hercule Poirot in the long-running Agatha Christie detective series, has received a knighthood. Also among the new knights is veteran entertainer Tommy Steele, 83, dubbed Britain's ""first rock and roll star"", who earned his first number one in 1957 with Singing the Blues. Brendan Foster, Eve Muirhead and Warren Gatland have been recognised from the world of sport Former BBC athletics commentator and long-distance runner Brendan Foster, 72, who founded the Great North Run, has been knighted for services to international and national sport and culture in the north east of England. Three Wales rugby union legends are also among the sports figures to be celebrated, with former head coach Warren Gatland, who led his team to a World Cup semi-final last year, becoming a CBE. Getting the same honour is former player Gareth Thomas, while Wales' most capped player, Alun Wyn Jones, is made an OBE. Jones said: ""I was initially reluctant to receive such an award in these trying times when there are so many people doing so much good for the community and are more worthy, but I see this as an acknowledgement to all the people who have helped me throughout my career."" MBEs also go to former England cricketer Darren Gough, Great Britain's Olympic curler Eve Muirhead, who led her team to bronze in 2014, and snooker player Reanne Evans, who became the first woman to compete against the world's best men. The creator of Grange Hill, Brookside and Hollyoaks, Phil Redmond, has been knighted for services to broadcasting and arts in the regions, while writer and director Sally Wainwright, who has been behind some of biggest television dramas in recent years, including Gentleman Jack, is made OBE.

The honours list is being hailed as the most diverse ever. Of the 1,495 recipients, 13% are from a BAME background and 6% have a disability. The list includes 740 women, which represents 49% of the total - down from 51% in the New Years Honours list last year. There are MBEs for rapper Dizzee Rascal and singer Mica Paris, who has recently joined the cast of Eastenders, while singer-songwriter Joan Armatrading and actor Adrian Lester are made CBEs.

"This video can not be played Welsh Secretary Simon Hart said UK ministers would never ""rule anything out"" The UK government would never ""rule anything out"" on bypassing the Welsh Government to build an M4 relief road, the Welsh secretary has told BBC Wales. Simon Hart said UK ministers would ""much prefer"" a ""collaborative project"" to tackle congestion around Newport and the Brynglas tunnels. He added that while they ""probably could"" bypass Welsh ministers it would be ""complicated"" and ""controversial"". The Welsh Government said the relief road was a matter for Wales. Wales' First Minister Mark Drakefordscrapped a relief road planlast year afterdeclaring a climate emergency. Could UK government build an M4 relief road? Prime minister has 'no say' on the M4 relief road M4 relief road: Â£1m spent on two houses weeks before axe The recently published UK Internal Market Bill, if passed into law, will give the UK government power to spend on otherwise devolved areas such as infrastructure and economic development. Speaking to the BBC Politics Wales programme, Mr Hart said that if the UK government could ""find a way"" of building the M4 relief road it would. He said he did not want to bypass the Welsh Government, but added: ""There are ways in which I suspect we probably could, it would be complicated, controversial, it would require years probably of legal wrangling. ""We would much prefer the Welsh Government to come to the table, look at this as a collaborative project. ""But until we get to that point, I'm afraid there's not just a blockage at Brynglas, there's a blockage in Cardiff as well."" When asked whether new powers granted through the UK Internal Market Bill would allow UK ministers to bypass the Welsh Government if they could not get them on board, Mr Hart said: ""We never rule anything in, or rule anything out."" The cancelled 14-mile relief road was estimated to cost Â£1.6bn But he said these new powers were ""not there to try and put Welsh Government in a difficult position"" but to ""enhance what we all want to do which is job creation and investment in Wales"". The Welsh Government said a decision had ""already been made"" regarding the relief road. It added: ""We remain committed to tackling congestion with solutions that recognise the unprecedented challenge of climate change as well as the financial pressures caused by ten years of austerity and capital budget cuts."" Mr Hart said the UK government had ""already ruled out"" using money provided to the Welsh Government by the Treasurythrough the block grant or Barnett formulato fund infrastructure projects because it was ""earmarked for other things"". He added there also ""isn't a lot of spare money knocking around at the moment"" for new money to be made available. But he said the Shared Prosperity Fund - promised cash to replace EU funding after the Brexit transition period - would be ""one option"". However, last week a cross-party group of MPs accused the UK government of making""negligible"" progress in its plans to replace EU funds in Wales after Brexit. This video can not be played In July Boris Johnson promised to ""unblock the Brynglas tunnels"" Conservative former Welsh secretary Stephen Crabb called the lack of detail of this fund, three months away from the end of the Brexit transition period, ""completely unacceptable"". Mr Hart admitted ""progress had been slow"" but said it was ""enshrined in a manifesto commitment"" that Wales would receive ""not a penny less"". ""We realise that the clock is ticking. I know that Welsh Government are getting anxious about it,"" he said. ""I hold my hands up to some extent to say, 'look, I'm really sorry this hasn't happened as fast as it should have done, but that doesn't mean that it isn't going to happen and it doesn't mean that it isn't going to happen in time'."" He added there would be ""no cut-off point"" to the funding. The Welsh Government said it was ""vital"" that the UK government committed to funding for Welsh businesses. When asked whether he could guarantee that the Shared Prosperity Fund would still be allocated based on areas of greatest need, Mr Hart said: ""If jobs, livelihoods, prosperity support are the driving influences for this - then of course. ""This enables us to spend it properly in the places that need it most. ""And the answers don't all lie in Cardiff, and they don't all lie in Westminster either - they actually lie in the 22 local authorities who are responsible day to day for some of these issues. ""The fact is devolution doesn't stop at the Cardiff postcode, and devolution is actually about making sure that people in every community in Wales get their fair share, not only the money but of the decision making process.""

"Celebrity cook Mary Berry and grime pioneer Dizzee Rascal have been honoured in the Queen's Birthday Honours list. Berry, who has earned the status of national treasure over a six-decade career, was ""overwhelmed"" at being made a dame for services to broadcasting, the culinary arts and charity. It is ""such a huge honour"", she said. Dizzee Rascal, real name Dylan Kwabena Mills, has been made an MBE for services to music. Reacting to the news,Dame Maryadded: ""When I was first told that I was going to be a dame you don't really believe it. And then it's so exciting, and you feel very proud. This video can not be played Mary Berry on damehood: ""I'll still be the same person"" ""For most of my life I have been lucky enough to follow my passion to teach cookery through books and the media. ""To be a dame is really the icing on the cake."" The former Great British Bake Off judge joked: ""I just wish my parents and brothers were here to share my joy, as my only achievement at school was just one O-Level - in cookery of course."" Dame Mary is no stranger to the Royal Family, having made meringue roulades with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge last year, for her Berry Royal Christmas TV special. The much-loved broadcaster, baker and food writer is also a patron of Child Bereavement UK, after having lost her son William aged 19 in a car crash in 1989. In 2018, she told The Graham Norton Showshe was once arrestedat an airport after baking ingredients were mistaken for drugs. Dizzee Rascal has had five UK number one singles Dizzee Rascalis considered to have been one of the founding fathers of grime - a UK-based electronic rap genre which grew out of the English capital at the start of the century. In 2003, aged 19, the East London MC became the youngest artist to win the Mercury Prize, with his debut album Boy in da Corner. The elder statesman of the British rap game, who drops his seventh album E3 AF at the end of October,told the BBC in 2017that he deserved to be given top billing at Glastonbury Festival. ""I've toured this festival for years, never disappointed,"" he said. ""You can always count on me."" ""I'm basically at the stage where they need to make me headline this thing - because they ain't had no British rappers headline this festival."" His drive and success helped to pave the way for modern superstar Stormzy to eventually become the first black solo headliner in the history of the Worthy Farm event last year, bringing UK hip-hop and grime into the mainstream in the process. Dame Mary is joined by veteran actress and Coronation Street starMaureen Lipmanand The Woman in Black authorSusan Hill, in being made a dame commander.

"The BBC spoke to four diversity champions The lack of ethnic diversity at the top of UK companies is coming under increasing focus, with calls for change from big business groups and investors. Surveys continue to show that black, Asian, or minority ethnic (BAME) peopleare under-represented in senior positions.,external But some succeed, and then turn their drive and passion to helping others. The BBC has spoken to four of them. Pavita Cooper said she altered who she was to fit in Pavita Cooper runs More Difference, a recruitment and consultancy firm that promotes diversity. Working at blue-chip firms for more than 25 years she never felt discriminated against. But after she left, she realised she had been altering her personality to ""fit in"". ""I had adapted who I was to fit the environment,"" Pavita says. ""I presented a version of myself that would fit in with them."" ""I'm a Sikh, and faith is important to me,"" she adds. ""But I made an assumption I should be just like them."" Despite under-representation, she says people with an Asian background tend to have an easier time getting to the top of large firms than black people. ""If you're black, generally the experience is worse,"" she says. What's more, there's a ""hierarchy of race"", she says, with ""very black women"" having the toughest time of all. One way to solve this problem is to make ethnic minority pay gap reporting mandatory, to force executives to act, she says. Funke Abimbola says she missed out on job opportunities because of her African name One black woman who managed to get into high-flying jobs in the UK is lawyer, consultant, and campaigner Funke Abimbola. She experienced discrimination working in the legal profession, even though she had what she describes as a ""privileged"" upbringing. ""I had to put in a lot more effort to get my foot in the door,"" she says. She refused to change her African name, even though she says she missed out on job opportunities because of it. Company boards 'must have at least one BAME member' L&G demands diversity on FTSE boards Black History Month: Images of strength and beauty And she says she had to deal with micro-aggressions - everyday slights and indignities - on a daily basis. For example, a client once used a racial slur in a meeting. ""When he said it, he knew I was black,"" she says. As she climbed higher up the ladder, she was criticised as being ""too assertive"" by executives. ""White male leaders can't deal with it,"" she says. ""They say I am 'over-promoting' myself."" She says black people in business face ""systemic barriers"" such as low expectations about their potential, and that because there are so few in top businesses, black people get scrutinised more. You have to have ""real steel"" to progress, she says. Dawid Konotey-Ahulu was told he wouldn't be joining a barristers chamber Entrepreneur Dawid Konotey-Ahulu is involved in initiatives to try to improve workplace diversity. He started out as a lawyer before having a successful City career, but says he faced extra hurdles compared with white people. In the 1980s he was training to be a barrister and managed to get what's known as a ""pupillage"" - a kind of internship - at a Middle Temple chamber in London. It is usual for such interns to be offered a tenancy at the chamber - a job - after completing this training. But Dawid was told he wouldn't be in the running because there was already one black barrister there. ""The bar is shockingly unrepresentative,"" he says. Dawid, who is one of the co-founders of consultancy Redington, said his time working in investment banking was less discriminatory. However, black people are still under-represented in Britain's financial heart, he says. ""I spent a lot of time working with pension funds. You don't see a lot of people who look like me."" Company boards 'must have at least one BAME member' There are various obstacles to success for black people, which Dawid likens to ""kinks in a hose"". Once you sort those kinks out, the water can flow freely again, he says. Obstacles include few mentors and role models for black children and numerous reasons executives give for not hiring and promoting black people. ""You have to say to 11-year-olds: 'You see those tall, shiny buildings over there [in the City]? There's a seat for you there',"" he says. Senior executives say the black talent pool is too small for senior positions - a situation which has become self-fulfilling - and that skin colour shouldn't matter, as they just want to hire the best people. He says this argument only works if there is a level playing field to begin with - but there isn't. He also says some senior executives use the BAME acronym as a smokescreen. Firms can ""muddy the water"" by saying they are hiring BAME people, and yet can predominantly be hiring Asian people - who already have more representation in the City than black people. David Wallis says micro-aggressions knock people's confidence There are also people working inside companies to try to change the situation. David Wallis is a partner at accountancy firm Deloitte, and helped to launch the company's ""black action plan"", which aims to educate people within the company and to nurture black talent. He too has experienced micro-aggressions from clients. David's father is British and his mother is from Ghana, and his name comes from his father's side. When he meets some clients for the first time there is an ""audible gasp"" because ""I don't fit the stereotype of what a 'David Wallis' looks like"", he says. The problem with such reactions is the feeling of not being accepted, he says. ""As human beings we need to be part of a group,"" he says. ""Micro-aggressions show you're not part of the group, and that can have wide-ranging consequences."" They can dent confidence, he says, and even contribute to mental health issues.

"Transgender women are now unable to play for women's teams World Rugby's decision to prevent transgender women from competing at the highest levels of the women's game has provoked a mixed reaction. The move has been criticised by LGBT charity Stonewall, while some women's rights and gay rights campaigners have welcomed the decision. New guidelines published on Friday""do not recommend""transgender women play contact rugby ""on safety grounds"". National unions can be flexible in their application of the guidelines at community level. Stonewall says it is ""deeply disappointed"" with the decision, but Fair Play for Women - which ""works to protect the rights of women and girls in the UK"" - thanked World Rugby ""for not trading away women's safety"". ""The proposals were based on hypothetical data modelling that has little relevance to the questions of fairness and safety in rugby that the policy review sought to address,"" said Stonewall chief executive Nancy Kelley. ""Important policies like this should be based on robust, relevant evidence and work closely with trans people playing in the sport."" However, Bev Jackson, co-founder of the LGB Alliance, said the organisation ""applauds World Rugby for conducting a thorough, evidence-based study and making a decision on that basis to protect safety in women's rugby. We are very pleased that they resisted political pressure and kept to scientific facts. Many lesbians play this sport and they are enormously relieved."" She added that ""judging by the reactions we have received, a great many LGB people and indeed many trans people think this was the right decision"". Dr Nicola Williams, director of Fair Play For Women, said: ""World Rugby have taken a transparent and evidence-based approach and we welcome their decision to prioritise safety and fairness for elite female players. ""We now look to Rugby's national governing bodies to follow their lead and guarantee the same protections for the thousands of women and girls who play at club level."" Transgender men remain permitted to play men's contact rugby union, but the sport's governing body says a review of its existing guidelines had concluded that ""safety and fairness cannot presently be assured for women competing against trans women in contact rugby"". World Rugby chairman Bill Beaumont said: ""We recognise that the science continues to evolve and we are committed to regularly reviewing these guidelines, always seeking to be inclusive."" Speaking to BBC Sport in August, Grace McKenzie, a trans woman who plays for Golden Gate Women's rugby club in San Francisco, said she was worried ""that other sporting federations will look at World Rugby and begin to second-guess the existing science that supports trans women's inclusion in sport, and begin to make policies based out of a place of fear instead of a place of logic and reason"". ""I want to be able to participate fully with my team and in the sport that I love. I think that there is still a path forward to allow us to do that,"" she said. Former Great Britain swimmer Sharron Davies, who has beenvocal on the issue of trans women in elite sport,also welcomed World Rugby's decision. The 57-year-old, a silver medallist at the 1980 Olympics, posted on social media: ""If we, as a fair society, want equal opportunities for females to medals, team places, safe sport and scholarships, with all the associations, rewards and careers, sport must be based on biological sex.""

"Conservative MPs in northern England seats are launching a campaign to ensure Boris Johnson sticks to his promise to boost their regions. The PM has made ""levelling up"" - spreading money and power around the country - one of his key priorities. But the 35-strong Tory group say they want to ensure the government delivers. It includes several MPs who won seats in traditional Labour heartlands - the so-called ""Red Wall"" - at last year's general election. Paul Howell, who won Tony Blair's old seat, in Sedgefield, Simon Fell, the MP for Barrow-in-Furness and Sara Britcliffe, who at 24 became the youngest Conservative MP when she won Hyndburn, in Lancashire, are among those who have signed up to the group provisionally named the Northern Research Group. Ms Britcliffe said: ""I don't need to join a group to speak up for Hyndburn but I have also the responsibility of making sure that we do deliver on our promise."" Five surprising facts about inequality in the UK Don't let virus widen north-south divide - Labour Can Johnson's levelling-up mission survive Covid? The group's leader Jake Berry, who has been the Conservative MP for Rossendale and Darwen since 2010, said it was not ""about giving government a bad time"". He told BBC Radio 4's The Week in Westminster: ""There are arguments that we collectively as northern MPs make together, to create a compelling case for the government to invest in the north"". These include ""making sure that this government delivers on its promise to 'level up' the north, deliver that Northern Powerhouse and create wealth across the north of England,"" he added. ""We don't form a government unless we win the north."" Mr Berry is the former minister for Northern Powerhouse, which was set up by former Chancellor George Osborne to redress the North-South economic imbalance, and to attract investment into northern cities and towns. He has recently accused Mr Johnson of ""enjoying"" his Covid-19 powers ""a little bit too much"" - and suggested the government had ""fallen into that fatal trap of making national decisions based on a London-centric view with London data."" Last monthConservative MPs launched a ""levelling up taskforce""which said the government should aim to increase wages and employment rates in the poorest areas. The promise to ""level up"" the country was a key part of the Conservative's 2019 general election campaign which saw the party win a number of seats in northern England and the Midlands traditionally held by Labour.

"Liverpool is expected to be placed under severe new restrictions next week The prime minister is to make a statement to MPs on Monday giving details of new restrictions to slow the spread of coronavirus in England. A letter from Boris Johnson's adviser to MPs in the North West seen by the BBC says it is ""very likely"" some areas will face further restrictions. But some regional leaders warn the new plan for a three-tier local lockdown system will only create more confusion. It comes as a doctors' union calls for clearer and more stringent rules. Under the new restrictions, pubs and restaurants could be closed in parts of northern England and the Midlands - where some of the highest numbers of cases are occurring - while a ban on overnight stays is also being considered. It is understood that the most severe measures - imposed for areas in tier three - would be agreed with local leaders in advance. The details of each tier, including the level of infection at which an area would qualify for it and the nature of the restrictions, are being debated this weekend. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmersaid,externalit was grossly irresponsible for anonymous government sources to tell newspapers on Thursday about plans for further restrictions on millions of people, without any detail, consultation or statement from the prime minister. What are the Covid restrictions where I live? How many cases are there in my area? Covid cases increase rapidly as next steps planned The letter to the MPs from Downing Street's chief strategic adviser Sir Edward Lister says the government is hoping to ""finalise these details as soon as possible"" amid ""rising incidence in parts of the country"". It also cites the ""engagement that is taking place today and during the course of the weekend with local authority leaders in your region"". Sir Edward says the set of measures being discussed ""present difficult choices. We must seek to strike the right balance between driving down transmission, and safeguarding our economy and society from the worst impact"". In the face of pressure from MPs, elected mayors and council leaders, the prime minister has signalled he wants ""much closer engagement"" with local politicians. As a senior government source said, they will bring ""expertise on what will work in their regions"". The hope is for ""top tier"" restrictions in the new multi-level system to be agreed between the government and local leaders in advance. There is an acknowledgement from inside government that this marks a change in approach. It is a shift away from what Labour described as a ""Whitehall knows best"" attitude. It will allow local politicians, some of whom until now have complained of being frozen out, to have a greater input. But it will also mean they are accountable, alongside government ministers, for the success or failure of the measures introduced. They will have to share the responsibility, perhaps blame, if measures don't work or prove unpopular. And amid calls for clarity, it seems the new tiered system could vary region by region, making clear national messaging more difficult. Susan Hopkins, deputy director of Public Health England's national infection service, said the number of cases was rising all over the country, but more quickly in the North East, North West and Yorkshire and Humber than the South. She said it was concerning that cases were rising ""quite fast"" in pockets of north-west England among the over-60s, the group most likely to need to be admitted to hospital. A number of areas in the North West, the North East and the Midlands are already subject to stricter restrictions. A tiered system of measures is designed to replace the patchwork of existing rules across the country. Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick told BBC Radio 4's Any Questions there needed to be ""greater freedom for local areas to design measures for themselves"". He said there was ""a merit to simplicity"", adding that in local areas ""local leaders will know best"". Liverpool's Labour Mayor Joe Anderson said he expected Liverpool - where there are currently 600 cases per 100,000 people - to be placed in tier three, under the highest set of restrictions. He told the BBC's Today programme he understood this would involve the lockdown of all the city's pubs from Wednesday. He said the government was wrong to allow Liverpool's bars and pubs to stay open this weekend, with infection rates so high. He accepted people in the city should take individual responsibility and said he was ""angry and frustrated"" at those flouting the rules, but added: ""I'm not convinced people trust the government's decisions."" Asked what his role would be in setting the restrictions, he said there had been conversation with Downing Street, but no consultation. It was clear the decisions had already been made, he said, but they were listening to his suggestions about how spikes in the city could best be dealt with. SOCIAL DISTANCING:How have rules on meeting friends changed? FACE MASKS:When do I need to wear one? TESTING:How do I get a virus test? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? Martin Gannon, Labour leader of Gateshead Council, said there had been ""warm words"" in a meeting with civil servants but ultimately the laws would be made by government. He said he would oppose any further restrictions placed on the North East, saying they could be ""counter-productive"" and lead to resistance from the public. Current measures were starting to bring down case numbers, he insisted, and the government needed to help local authorities win people's confidence. And Glen Sanderson, Conservative leader of Northumberland County Council, said he did not want blanket restrictions on Northumberland, which has large rural areas ""virtually unaffected"" by the virus as well as towns where case numbers were rising. ""I don't think the argument is there to bring in much tougher restrictions - we have to take people with us. If we can't get people to conform, we won't make any progress,"" he told BBC News. Meanwhile, the British Medical Association (BMA) said the government's measures to reduce the spread of the virus had not worked, given the uncontrolled escalation, and has made its own recommendations. It wants to see masks worn in all offices and outdoors where two-metre distancing is not possible; free medical grade masks for the over-60s and vulnerable groups; financial support for businesses to become Covid-secure; and the ""rule of six"" tweaked to allow only two households to meet in groups of no more than six. Chairman Dr Chaand Nagpaul said: ""The infection has risen following rapid relaxation of measures and with the Westminster government letting down its guard - as recently as August, the government was encouraging people to travel, go to work and mix in restaurants and pubs."" Speaking at the Co-operative Party virtual conference, Labour leader Sir Keir accused the government of serial incompetence, saying a test, trace and isolate system was ""critical"". Without that, ""thousands and thousands of people are walking around today who should be in self-isolation"", he warned. On Friday the number of people in the UK to have tested positive for coronavirus rose by 13,864 - a decrease of 3,676 on Thursday's figure - with a further 87 deaths reported on thegovernment's dashboard.,external TEST AND TRACE EXPOSED:Panorama hears from whistleblowers working on the coronavirus tracking system LOVE LIFE:Fancy an escape?
