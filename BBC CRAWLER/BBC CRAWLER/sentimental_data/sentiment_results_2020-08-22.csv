Twelve people were on board the rigid inflatable boat (RIB) when it hit a buoy near Netley, in Southampton Water, just after 10:00 BST, police said. Peter Brown, duty coxswain of Hamble Lifeboat, said passing boats had helped four people who required ""urgent medical care"" out of the water. All of those on board the RIB were taken to hospital where the teenage girl was pronounced dead. Her next-of-kin have been informed, Hampshire Constabulary said. A spokesman for the South Central Ambulance Service said no-one else involved in the crash suffered life-threatening injuries. The coastguard said it received multiple 999 and mayday calls following the crash near the entrance to the River Itchen.

"The baby gorilla arrived in the early hours of Wednesday A baby gorilla has been born at Bristol Zoo. Keepers arrived to find the new arrival nestling in the arms of its mother. Photographs taken just hours after the birth on Wednesday show Kala - a nine-year-old western lowland gorilla - cradling the newborn. Staff said both were ""doing well"". The zoo said Kala gave birth naturally with the baby's father, Jock, nearby. Her first baby died last year a week after it was born. Mother and child are both said to be doing well Lynsey Bugg, the zoo's curator of mammals, said: ""We knew we were having a baby gorilla due and we've been on baby watch for a little while. ""On Tuesday Kala looked nice and comfortable and not causing us any concerns or worries. ""I came in [on Wednesday] morning to find a brand new baby in the house. It was lovely."" Lynsey Bugg said Kala was ""a very attentive mother"" She said staff had been ""on tenterhooks"" following the death of Kala's first baby last September, a week after she underwent an emergency caesarean. ""It is so lovely that she was able to give birth naturally and baby and mum are really well. ""She's a very attentive mother and very nurturing and you see lots of suckling from the baby, and the baby looks really strong and a good size."" It will be a while before the zoo knows if the baby is male or female, Ms Bugg said. ""They are not all that easy to sex and we want to have a few looks before we are certain."" The new gorilla joins a troop of six at the zoo, which are part of a breeding programme. The western lowland gorilla is classed as critically endangered, with some estimates putting the number left in the wild at about 100,000.

"The US Postal Service delivered 142.6 billion pieces of mail in 2019 The US House of Representatives has passed a bill that would inject $25bn (Â£19bn) into the Postal Service (USPS) ahead of November's election. The legislation would also block cuts and changes that critics have said will hamper mail-in voting. Democratic Speaker Nancy Pelosi recalled lawmakers from the summer recess to vote on the bill, which she said would protect the USPS. After the vote, President Trump tweeted the measure was a Democrat ballot scam. ""Representatives of the Post Office have repeatedly stated that they DO NOT NEED MONEY, and will not make changes, "" said Donald Trump.  He has threatened to veto the bill, which is in any case unlikely to make progress in the Republican-controlled Senate. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell said the chamber would ""absolutely not pass"" the bill. Postmaster General Louis DeJoy said earlier that further cost-cutting measures at the postal service would be suspended until after November's vote. A slowdown in mail deliveries amid cost-saving measures at USPS has fuelled fears about how one of the oldest and most trusted institutions in the US can handle an unprecedented influx of mail-in ballots due to the coronavirus pandemic. President Trump strongly opposes mail-in ballots and has repeatedly suggested it could lead to widespread voter fraud despite there being no evidence for this. US postmaster: Mail-in ballots will arrive in time What is US row over postal service about? The ""Delivering for America Act,external"" passed by the House in a rare Saturday sitting includes $25bn of emergency coronavirus funding requested by the USPS's board of governors. More than a dozen Republicans crossed the floor to vote with their Democratic opponents. The bill would require the USPS to treat all official election correspondence as first-class mail. The service would be prohibited until January 2021 from implementing or approving any changes to operations or service levels that would ""impede prompt, reliable, and efficient service"", including closing or reducing the hours of post offices, removing mail sorting machines and mailboxes, or stopping overtime payments. ""This is not a partisan issue,"" Democratic Representative Carolyn Maloney, the bill's author, said before the debate. ""It makes absolutely no sense to impose these kinds of dangerous cuts in the middle of a pandemic and just months before the elections in November."" Allow Twitter content?

Ms Pelosi stressed that the USPS was not a business. ""While we always want to subject every federal dollar to the scrutiny of what we're getting for it, let us remember that it is a service. No business that I can think of would ever be saddled with what we've done to the Postal Service,"" she added. Republican political leaders on Friday said Democrats had ""sought to spread baseless conspiracy theories about the USPS for political gain"",externaland had ""manufactured a crisis to undermine President Trump at the expense of America's institutions"". Democrats and their supporters say the cost-cutting measures will hamper mail-in voting They also condemned Democrats for pursuing for what they said was ""an unnecessary bailout plan that does not fix any of the underlying operational issues"". On Friday, the postmaster general told a Senate committee there had been ""no changes to any policies with regard to election mail"" and that the USPS was ""fully capable and committed to delivering the nation's election mail fully and on time"". Mr DeJoy - a top Republican donor and former logistics executive appointed to lead the agency in May - acknowledged that the changes he had instigated had slowed some mail delivery, but insisted that it was ""outrageous"" to suggest they were intended to help President Trump in November.

"Coronavirus will be present ""forever in some form or another"", a member of the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) has said. Sir Mark Walport said people would need to be vaccinated at regular intervals. His comments come after the head of the World Health Organization (WHO)said he hoped the pandemic would be over within two years, as the Spanish flu had taken two years to overcome. Sir Mark said denser populations and travel meant the virus spread easily. He also said the world population was now much larger than in 1918. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Sir Mark said that, in order to control the pandemic, ""global vaccination"" would be required, but coronavirus would not be a disease like smallpox ""which could be eradicated by vaccination"". Where are the world's coronavirus hotspots? UK tourists dash home as quarantine rules kick in ""This is a virus that is going to be with us forever in some form or another, and almost certainly will require repeated vaccinations,"" he said. ""So, a bit like flu, people will need re-vaccination at regular intervals."" Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, head of the WHO, has said that the Spanish flu of 1918 took two years to overcome, and that advances in technology could allow the world to halt coronavirus ""in a shorter time"". The flu of 1918 killed at least 50 million people. Coronavirus has so far killed 800,000 people. Nearly 23 million infections have been recorded but the number of people who have actually had the virus is thought to be much higher due to inadequate testing and asymptomatic cases. SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? JOBS:Can my boss force me to go to work? FACE MASKS:When should you wear one? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? GLOBAL SPREAD:Tracking the pandemic Sir Mark warned that it was ""possible"" coronavirus would get ""out of control"" again, but said more targeted measures could now be used instead of a generic lockdown. Coronavirus cases have been increasing in European countries in recent weeks. Some nations, which had appeared successful in suppressing the initial outbreaks, are now seeing infections rise again. As of 22 August,the UK recorded 21.5 coronavirus cases per 100,000 people over the last fortnight,external, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. Sir Mark said: ""We know that less than one in five people around the country have been infected, so 80% of the population are still susceptible to this virus. ""It is this terrible balance between trying to minimise the harm to people from the infection and protecting people, whilst keeping society going."" He said he was worried about the rise in the number of cases in Europe and other parts of the world. Meanwhile, tourists returning to the UKspent thousands of poundsarranging new flights in a race to get home before new travel rules came into force. From 04:00 BST on Saturday, travellers coming back from Croatia, Austria and Trinidad and Tobago must quarantine for 14 days. There were similar scenes last weekend when new rules kicked in forthose returning from countries including France and the Netherlands.

"Thousands of people attended an illegal rave in Greater Manchester in June Police in England will be able to fine organisers of illegal gatherings of more than 30 people such as raves up to Â£10,000 from Friday, ministers say. Those who attend gatherings and those who do not wear face coverings where it is mandatory can be given a Â£100 fine, doubling on each offence up to Â£3,200. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland can set their own enforcement rules. The government first unveiled plans for tougher penalties for those breaking coronavirus rules earlier this month. Details of the stricter rules come after extra restrictions to stem the spread of Covid-19were introduced in north-west England. Why did raves become illegal? 'Why I want to go to lockdown raves' Overnight, police in Birmingham disruptedmore than 70 unlicensed social gatherings including house and street parties, one of which featured marquees and a DJ. In Huddersfield, officersbroke up an illegal rave involving about 300 people,external. Two police vehicles were damaged and four people arrested after officers broke up a party breaking lockdown rules in Greater Manchester, where restrictions between households continue. About 50 people were at the gathering at a house, which had a gazebo set up with loud speakers, music equipment and party lights, Greater Manchester Police said. And in Blackburn, Lancashire, where extra restrictions are also in force,more than 150 people gathered for a rave at a reservoir. This video can not be played Rave culture in the UK has given us superstar artists and DJs like The Prodigy and Carl Cox Home Secretary Priti Patel said: ""These gatherings are dangerous and those who organise them show a blatant disregard for the safety of others."" She added: ""We will continue to crack down on the small minority who think they are above the law."" The tougher rules have been welcomed by the National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC). Commander Ade Adelekan, NPCC lead for unlicensed music events, said those who organised such gatherings ""irresponsibly put people's health and safety at risk"". He added: ""To the organisers of this sort of activity, I strongly advise that you seriously consider the risks you're creating for everyone in attendance and the wider community. There is a risk of prosecution for those who organise these events and equipment will be seized."" Insp Andy Berry, chairman of the Devon and Cornwall Police Federation said ""definitive powers"" to help ""control these large gatherings"" were helpful, as his colleagues have been seeing an ""incredible surge in demand"". Speaking to BBC Breakfast, he said: ""We are a police force, we should be there primarily to deal with crime... what we don't want to do is break up children's birthday parties. ""We are seeing an unprecedented amount of calls coming in where neighbours are reporting these breaches and these demands are really bringing my colleagues and members to fatigue and breaking point,"" Mr Berry said.

GLOBAL SPREAD:Tracking the pandemic The tougher penalties will also see those who flout rules around face coverings issued a larger fine - starting at Â£100 and doubling up to Â£3,200 for each repeat offence. In England, face coverings are mandatory in many indoor settings, including public transport, shops and museums, with some exemptions for children or on medical grounds. It comes after a further 18 deaths were recorded in the UK on Saturday, bringing the total number of people to have died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus to 41,423.

"This video can not be played Coronavirus: How to wear a face covering The World Health Organization (WHO) has issued guidance saying children over the age of 12 should wear masks, in line with recommended practice for adults in their country or area. It admits little is known about how children transmit the virus but cites evidence that teenagers can infect others in the same way as adults. Children aged five and under should not normally wear masks, the WHO said. More than 800,000 people have now died with coronavirus worldwide. At least 23 million cases of infection have been registered,external, according to Johns Hopkins University, with most of them recorded in the US, Brazil and India. However the true number of people who have had the virus is believed to be far higher, due to insufficient testing and asymptomatic cases. The numbers have been rising again in countries as diverse as South Korea, EU states and Lebanon. Why Spain is seeing second Covid wave New study shows more women in Delhi had Covid Where are the world's coronavirus hotspots? WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has said he hopes the pandemic will beover in two yearsbut a top scientific adviser in the UK warnedCovid-19 might never be eradicated, with people needing regular vaccinations. Theadvice published on the WHO website,externalcovers three age groups: Children aged 12 and overshould wear a mask under the same conditions as adults, in particular when they cannot guarantee a distance of at least one metre from others and there is widespread transmission in the area Forchildren aged between six and 11, the WHO advises taking into account how widespread the transmission of the virus is and whether the child is interacting with high-risk individuals such as the elderly. It also stresses the need for adult supervision to help children use, put on and take off masks safely Children aged five and undershould not, under normal circumstances, wear masks A child in a mask on the Wall Street Bull this week For teachers, the WHO says: ""In areas where there is widespread transmission, all adults under the age of 60 and who are in general good health should wear fabric masks when they cannot guarantee at least a one-metre distance from others. ""This is particularly important for adults working with children who may have close contact with children and one another."" Adults aged 60 or over, or those with underlying health conditions, should wear medical masks, it says. The WHO guidance does not specify whether a child over the age of 12 should wear a mask in school, but it may yet become a feature of the classroom as the new academic year begins. France recently made it mandatory for all children over 11,external, and a number of schools in the UK are taking it upon themselves to require students to wear them even though this is notofficial government guidance,external. James Gillespie's High School in Edinburgh is one such school, making the decision to require students to ""wear face coverings indoors whilst moving around between classes""after taking feedback from pupils, staff and parents.

"President Alexander Lukashenko told his officials to prepare forces on the border with Poland Allegations by Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko that ""foreign powers"" are organising a build-up of troops on the country's border are baseless, says Nato. Dressed in military fatigues, the president said he had placed his armed forces on ""high alert"". He is facing growing calls within Belarus for his resignation following a disputed election two weeks ago. Thousands of protesters again marched on the capital Minsk on Sunday. Long lines of people of all ages - from the elderly to those with small children - flowed into Independence Square from all directions, watched by hundreds of riot police, reporters at the scene said. Many of the marchers were carrying red and white flags or white flowers, and chanting anti-government slogans. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Earlier, Mr Lukashenko, who has ruled Belarus for 26 years, accused Nato of trying to split up Belarus and install a new president in Minsk. He said troops in Poland and Lithuania were readying themselves, and that he was moving his armed forces to the country's western border. This video can not be played What lies behind the Belarus protests? ""They are rocking the situation inside our country, trying to topple the authorities,"" Mr Lukashenko said, adding that he had ordered his security chiefs to ""take the toughest measures to defend the territorial integrity of our country"". Nato said it posed ""no threat to Belarus or any other country"" and had ""no military build-up in the region"". ""Our posture is strictly defensive,"" it said. ""The regime is trying to divert attention from Belarus's internal problems at any cost with totally baseless statements about imaginary external threats,"" Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda told AFP news agency. A Polish presidency official called the suggestion that Poland planned any border destabilisation ""regime propaganda"" by the Belarusians, which was ""sad and surprising"". ""Poland... has no such intention,"" the official added. Protests against a brutal police crackdown continued in Minsk on Saturday Nato urged Belarus to respect the fundamental human rights of its citizens. Mr Lukashenko was re-elected president on 9 August but the vote was widely considered to be fraudulent. Protests disputing the result were met with a brutal crackdown that killed at least four people and demonstrators said they had been tortured in prisons and detention centres. Large numbers of demonstrators are expected to rally in Minsk again on Sunday. Where is Belarus?It has Russia - the former dominant power - to the east and Ukraine to the south. To the north and west lie EU and Nato members Latvia, Lithuania and Poland. Why does it matter?Like Ukraine, this nation of 9.5 million is caught in rivalry between the West and Russia. President Lukashenko, an ally of Russia, has been nicknamed ""Europe's last dictator"". He has been in power for 26 years, keeping much of the economy in state hands, and using censorship and police crackdowns against opponents. What's going on there?Now there is a huge opposition movement, demanding new, democratic leadership and economic reform. They say Mr Lukashenko rigged the 9 August election - officially he won by a landslide. His supporters say his toughness has kept the country stable. The president has vowed to crush the unrest and has previously blamed the dissent on unnamed ""foreign-backed revolutionaries"". With protests and strike action continuing, including the walking out of state TV staff, Mr Lukashenko said he had flown in Russian broadcast journalists as cover to ""stabilise"" the situation, the Belarus state news agency Belta reports. ""I've asked Russians to lend us two to three groups of reporters just in case. Six to nine people from the most advanced television company,"" he said. On Saturday, crowds of protestors waved bright lights from mobile phones and flew Belarusian flags in the streets of Minsk while chanting ""freedom"". Allow Twitter content?

"Oldham, along with other parts of northern England, has extra restrictions in place Stricter new measures designed to stop the spread of coronavirus in the North West have been branded ""confusing"". Residents in Oldham and parts of Blackburn and Pendle have been told not to socialise with other households. Local council leaders said it was ""unclear"" how the rule would be implemented and policed and urged the government to issue detailed guidance. Workplaces, childcare facilities and businesses, including pubs and restaurants, will remain open. Under the new rules, introduced on Saturday, residents are advised to only use public transport for essential travel. Restaurants are advised to only cater for pre-booked customers, with a maximum of six people per table. Residents can also attend the weddings, civil partnerships and funerals of members of their household and close family, with ceremonies limited to 20 people Schools are still set to open from 1 September. The new ban on socialising will apply to the following areas of Blackburn with Darwen: Audley & Queen's Park, Bastwell & Daisyfield, Billinge & Beardwood, Blackburn Central, Little Harwood & Whitebirk, Roe Lee, Shear Brow & Corporation Park, Wensley Fold. Areas in Blackburn with Darwen where extra restrictions have been lifted are: Blackburn South & Lower Darwen, Blackburn South East, Darwen East, Darwen South, Darwen West, Ewood, Livesey with Pleasington, Mill Hill & Moorgate, West Pennine Restrictions in Pendle remain but the new socialising ban applies to the following areas: Whitefield, Walverden, Southfield, Bradley, Clover Hill, Brierfield, Marsden The new guidelines were leaked to a local newspaper before the government's official confirmation on Friday afternoon. Sean Fielding, leader of Oldham Council, said it was looking to provide clarity to residents ""because the announcement itself from the government wasn't the smoothest"". Mohammed Iqbal, leader of Pendle Council, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""The government has announced these tightening restrictions for local people in my area, yet they have not issued any detailed guidance as to how it will operate, who will police it. ""So local people are actually more confused than they were on Thursday evening."" Shoppers, pictured here in Manchester, are seen as part of the economic recovery On Saturday,Greater Manchester Police issued a social media post,externalurging people not to call 999 or 101 for clarification about the measures. However,the force were criticised on social media,externalafter they issued a fixed penalty notice to a homeowner who had hosted a child's birthday party in a garden, attended by three families. A police spokesman said: ""This was one of several breaches of Covid-19 regulations that were publicised to demonstrate the breadth of incidents GMP have been called to in just one night."" Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham said police were ""in a no-win situation because sometimes they get criticised for not doing enough and then when they do enforce the measures they get criticism back"". Since July, the government has been introducing extra restrictions in parts of northern England after a spike in coronavirus cases. The tighter rules will be removed in Wigan, Darwen and Rossendale on Wednesday after they recorded lower infection rates than other areas. Residents in those towns will be required to follow national guidance, including social distancing and wearing a face covering where appropriate. However, the extra restrictions will remain for the rest of Greater Manchester and East Lancashire, plus Preston, where gatherings ofseparate households are banned in most circumstances,external. How many confirmed cases are there in your area? A government spokesman said the ""sharp rise"" in confirmed cases was partly due to a major increase in testing led by local councils. He added the spike ""continues to be due to social mixing between younger age groups of 20-39 year olds"". Dr Sakthi Karunanithi, public health director at Lancashire County Council, said: ""The vast majority - more than 80% - of coronavirus transmission (in the affected parts of Pendle and Blackburn) is as a result of households mixing. ""That's why we are putting out a very clear message - do not socialise with people you don't live with."" The new rules came into force in Oldham, and parts of Pendle and Blackburn on Saturday Mohammed Khan, leader of Blackburn with Darwen Council, said the borough, which launched a local contact-tracing service earlier in August, would continue ""our important work fighting this infection at a really local level"". ""We know that our residents have been making huge sacrifices and that businesses are struggling. ""We desperately needed to prevent the threat of a full, borough-wide lockdown as this would have been devastating."" Mr Burnham said: ""We have been able to keep businesses open in Oldham and that's a significant victory for the council because they were worried about the fragility of the economy. ""So what we have got instead are more targeted measuresâ¦ which are much better than going into a lockdown situation where businesses have to close."" Mr Burnham said there had been ""a noticeable fall in cases this week"" in Oldham and other parts of Greater Manchester. ""Fingers crossed, we can see more boroughs released from these measures soon."" Pakistan cricket captain Azhar Ali is among celebrities who will promote the new guidelines Mr Fielding said Oldham Council had closed at least one pub since Friday for flouting the rules. He said the council had also enlisted celebrities such as Pakistan cricket captain Azhar Ali, who is currently playing  in a Test Match series against England, and The Inbetweeners actor James Buckley ""to get the message out to communities that might listen to [them] rather than listen to me."" ""We are also doing some really targeted intervention in our most affected communities, and that includes things like door-to-door testing, using community leaders to get messages over."" Earlier this week, the council shared a clip of Game Of Thrones actor James Cosmo warning residents that ""lockdown is coming"" unless they abide by guidelines. Elsewhere,Birmingham has been added to the government's watch list,and Northampton named an ""area of intervention"".

"Fredie Blom - seen here on his 116th birthday - said there was no special secret to his longevity A South African who was thought to be the oldest man in the world has died at the age of 116. Fredie Blom's identity documents showed he was born in Eastern Cape province in May 1904, although that was never verified by Guinness World Records. When he was a teenager, his entire family was wiped out by the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic. He went on to survive two world wars and apartheid. Mr Blom told the BBC in 2018 thatthere was no special secret to his longevity. ""There's only one thing - it's the man above [God]. He's got all the power. I have nothing. I can drop over any time but He holds me,"" he said. Mr Blom spent most of his life as a labourer - first on a farm and then in the construction industry - and only retired when he was in his 80s. Fredie Blom's identity documents list his date of birth as 8 May 1904 Although he gave up drinking many years ago, he was a regular smoker. However, a coronavirus-related lockdown imposed by the South African government reportedly meanthe was unable to buy tobacco to roll his own cigarettes on his 116th birthday,external. Mr Blom's family said he died of natural causes in Cape Town on Saturday. ""Two weeks ago oupa [grandfather] was still chopping wood,"" family spokesman Andre Naidoo told AFP news agency. ""He was a strong man, full of pride."" But within days Mr Blom shrank ""from a big man to a small person"", he added. Mr Naidoo said the family did not believe his death was related to Covid-19.

"This video can not be played Holidaymakers return to the UK: ""We looked at alternative ways of getting back before the deadline"" UK tourists have spent thousands of pounds on new flights and endured long drives in a race to get home before new coronavirus travel rules kicked in. As of 04:00 BST on Saturday, travellers returning to the UK from Croatia, Austria and Trinidad and Tobago must quarantine for 14 days. Children in families who did not return in time will miss the start of school in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. But searches for flights to Portugal rose as it was put onthe safe list,external. Meanwhile, extra restrictions to stem the spread of Covid-19have come into forcein north-west England. It comes as a further 18 deaths have been recorded in the UK, bringing the total number of people to have died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus to 41,423. Why is Croatia on the quarantine list? And other questions What are the UK's travel rules? Where can I go on holiday without having to quarantine? The quarantine measures for Croatia, Austria and Trinidad and Tobago have been imposed because of a spike in coronavirus cases in those countries, the UK government has said. As of 21 August,the UK recorded 21.2 coronavirus cases per 100,000 people over the last fortnight,external, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. In comparison, Croatia had 47.2 cases per 100,000, Austria had 33.0 and Portugal 28.5. There were about 17,000 British tourists in Croatia on Friday, according to the country's national tourist board. On Friday evening, British Airways flights arriving from the Croatian city of Dubrovnik and the capital Zagreb at London's Heathrow airport were among the last to reach the UK before the deadline. People wait for planes at Croatia's Split airport on Thursday Jane Grist, from Walton-on-Thames, Surrey, said she was ""livid"" because the rule change meant her two sons would have to miss the first week of school after they return from the Croatian city of Sibenik, on 27 August. ""We've been focusing on the return to school as a return to normality,"" she said. ""Now we've got to explain [to our youngest son] he won't be able to go back at the same time as all of his friends."" Ms Grist said the holiday was ""the one thing we have been looking forward to"" after she was made redundant last year - and now it has been ""spoilt"". Frano MatuÅ¡iÄ, Croatia's State Secretary for Tourism, said his country was ""really disappointed"" by the new quarantine rules and urged the UK government to reverse its decision. ""We think that this decision was not fair because we think that Croatia is a really safe destination,"" he told Sky News. Another Friday, another country in Europe where hundreds of British tourists have frantically had to figure out ways to head home early. The airline authorities here in Split put on two extra flights on Friday to cope with the sudden demand. There were at least 500 passengers on board both aircraft. All were British travellers who booked last minute. ""It beggars belief. Why was there such short notice for us to leave?"" Karen, an English teacher, tells me. She'd just begun a week in Split and was in the middle of booking a ferry to Italy to get out of the country by the evening, because she said the UK flights had sold out. In the beautiful medieval town of Sibernik, a group of eight friends from Nottingham Trent University had given up efforts to get back early. Instead they drank beers in a harbour-side cafe. Lou, 20, said: ""We tried to get something, but everything was too expensive."" Her friend Amber added: ""It's upsetting because we planned this trip carefully, and quarantine means we can't go back to part-time work for two weeks, which sucks because it helped towards my university studies."" Neil Warnes and his wife Jane have spent about Â£2,000 cutting short their holiday in Austria Neil Warnes, 59, from Margate, was on holiday with his wife and two teenage children in an Alpine village in Austria when he heard the news on Thursday evening. The family spent about Â£2,000 to cut their holiday short by one day, in order to get home before the quarantine rules came into effect. They left Seefeld - a town with ""hardly any people there"" - at 02:00 on Friday to get to Munich airport, for an early morning flight to Heathrow. ""As our car was parked at Gatwick, another cab journey was needed and we finally arrived home in Kent at midday,"" Mr Warnes said. ""Austria appeared to be adhering to all social distancing measures and hand sanitation stations were in all the shops. Our small hotel had three alone on the ground floor. ""With this in mind we were so surprised when the government restrictions were put in place as Austria have had a historically low level since March. There didn't really appear to be any problems at all,"" he added. Another traveller, Cristiano Torti, 41, paid about Â£1,500 to fly his wife and two children back to the UK six days earlier than planned. He said they had lost about Â£500 of the original return flight bookings, but it would have been ""very difficult"" to quarantine with his young children as he and his wife both work from home. You finally got abroad, but was it worth it? Who decides which countries I can safely visit? This video can not be played How do I quarantine after returning from abroad? Mr Torti, a developer from Oxfordshire, said that his eldest child would have missed some of the new school term had the family not returned in time. ""We've lost a lot of of money, between the accommodation, the flights, and the knock-on effects: the car hire, the airport parking. I kind of wish we'd stayed home, despite the miserable British weather,"" he said. SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? JOBS:Can my boss force me to go to work? FACE MASKS:When should you wear one? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? GLOBAL SPREAD:Tracking the pandemic Meanwhile, Google search data showed a significant rise in searches for the term ""flights to Portugal"" by UK users at about 18:00 BST on Thursday; with a smaller spike at 07:00 BST on Friday morning. This video can not be played Coronavirus: How to fly during a global pandemic (this video reflects the rules before the hotel quarantine was introduced in the UK) Several EasyJet flights from London airports to Portugal were listed as unavailable for Saturday and Sunday, while airlines such as Jet2 laid on extra seats to Faro from Monday across the UK. Travel expert Simon Calder tweeted that the cost of flights from Manchester to Faro on Saturday morning had risen from Â£50 to Â£98 in 30 minutes. People who do not self-isolate when required can be fined up to Â£1,000 in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland. In Scotland the fine is Â£480, and up to Â£5,000 for persistent offenders. The UK introduced the compulsory 14-day quarantine for arrivals from overseas in early June. But the following month, the four UK nations unveiled lists of ""travel corridors"", detailing countries that were exempt from the rule. Since then it has periodically updated that list, adding and removing countries based on their coronavirus infection rates and how they compare with the UK's.

"This video can not be played Prof Chris Whitty: ""The chances of children dying from Covid are incredibly small"" Children are more likely to be harmed by not returning to school next month than if they catch coronavirus, the UK's chief medical adviser says. Prof Chris Whitty said ""the chances of children dying from Covid-19 are incredibly small"" - but missing lessons ""damages children in the long run"". Millions of pupils in England, Wales and Northern Ireland are due to return to school within weeks. Prof Whitty also said Covid-19 would be a challenge for at least nine months. He said it was unlikely there would be a vaccine in 2020 but there was a ""reasonable chance"" of a successful jab being ready for the following winter in 2021-22. Nerves and delight: What's it like back at school? Will pupils do a full school day next term? Could reopening schools spread coronavirus? The government has said all pupils, in all year groups, in England will be expected to return to class full-time in September. Schools have already reopened in Scotland. Prof Whitty, who is also England's chief medical officer, said ""many more [children] were likely to be harmed by not going than harmed by going"" to school. ""There's also very clear evidence from the UK and around the world that children much less commonly get a severe illness and end up having to be hospitalised if they get symptomatic Covid,"" he added. His interview came as chief and deputy chief medical officers for all four UK nations said there were ""no risk-free options"" and it was important for parents and teachers to understand both the risks and benefits as schools reopen. Protective measures like distancing, hand washing and cleaning can reduce risks, Prof Whitty said Labour MP Lucy Powell told BBC Breakfast her party was concerned that the ""chaos"" brought on by a heavily criticised grading system forA-level and GCSE resultshad led schools to lose ""two valuable weeks that could have been spent preparing"" for the safe return to the classroom. The shadow business minister said schools could open with greater confidence if the Department for Education provided ""more clarity"" for parents and teachers, improved the coronavirus contact tracing programme, and offered more widespread testing - such as to people without symptoms. Moral duty to get all children back in school - PM How did the controversial exam algorithm work? Pubs 'may need to shut' to allow schools to reopen Prof Whitty used his interview to highlight ""overwhelming"" evidence that in not going to school, children are more likely to have ""mental and physical ill health in the long run"". He added that the vast majority of children who died with the virus had ""very serious"" pre-existing health conditions. According to the Office for National Statistics' latest data on ages, there were 10 deaths recorded as ""due to Covid-19"" among those aged 19 and under in England and Wales between March and June - and 46,725 deaths among those aged 20 and over. Of the more than one million children who attended pre-school and primary schools in England in June, 70 children and 128 staff were infected in outbreaks of the virus,according to a Public Health England study published on Sunday,external. It said most of the 30 outbreaks detected in that time had likely been caused by staff members infecting other staff or students, with only two outbreaks thought to involve students infecting other students. The study also suggested children who went to school during June were more likely to catch coronavirus at home than at school. Prof Chris Whitty was speaking officially on behalf of all the chief medical officers of the UK's nations. But this rare interview reveals a lot more about his own views on how the virus is developing. More parents going back to work with schools reopening will probably, he believes, increase virus transmission and that may require restrictions in other areas. He says people need to accept that, with autumn and winter, the pressures will increase. He refers to ""an incredibly narrow path"" to be walked to protect people from the virus without further damage to the economy, meaning there is ""not very much room for manoeuvre"". If the virus picks up among younger adults, he argues, that can spread to older and more vulnerable age groups. His conclusion is that there is a really serious challenge for at least another nine months. This is a chief medical officer who seems unlikely to back further easing of restrictions and to be ready to propose tightening if that is the price which has to be paid for the vitally important goal of getting children back to school. Prof Whitty said it looked as if ""there is much less transmission from children to adults than adults to adults"". He said reopening schools would connect households in other ways - for example by parents meeting at school gates, or mixing with others as a result of being able to return to work. ""The fact of schools being open will probably lead to some increase in transmission but much of that is indirect,"" he said. This video can not be played Can children catch and spread coronavirus? Data shows that staff spreading the virus to other members of staff is ""maybe actually more important than staff members catching it from pupils"", Prof Whitty said. He said that - much like other workplaces - ""it is staff coming together and spreading it to one another"" that can drive infections. ""Even with the best actions, you cannot take that [risk of transmission] down to zero and we're really clear about that and we don't want to pretend otherwise."" Epidemiologist Prof Sian Griffiths told BBC Breakfast that returning school staff - and parents who can therefore go back to their workplace - should remember the ""simple messages"" around hygiene, such as washing hands regularly and covering sneezes. ""Some of the times when people forget about transmission are for example in the staff room, or in the work canteen or in the coffee room at work... that's how the disease is spread in situations outside homes,"" she said. Prof Whitty said the risks could be minimised by having hygiene and cleaning measures in place, but warned that as with any workplace, ""we cannot say the risk will be taken down to zero"". The NASUWT teachers' union said the ""critical importance"" of social distancing and hygiene had been reinforced by the chief medical officers' statement. The National Education Union accused the government of letting down pupils and teachers by lacking a ""Plan B"" if there is a spike in infections. It said the government should be seeking extra space, as well as mobilising supply staff, to allow classes to continue safely if infections rise. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said ministers had been doing ""everything we can"" to help schools get ready to reopen. Writing in the Sunday Times,external, he said he wanted to reassure every parent and pupil that schools ""are ready for them"", and the autumn return to schools was ""more important than ever"" this year. Meanwhile, Mr Williamson defended his decision to visit Scarborough days before the release of A-level results in England,up to 40% of which are being changed after the initial grading system was scrapped. Mr Williamsonsaid in a tweet,externalthat, while he visited family in Scarborough, he was in ""constant communication"" with the Department for Education. Social media pictures show pupils sitting close to each other at schools in Scotland Helen Carter, deputy head teacher at Burnage Academy for Boys in Manchester, told BBC Breakfast that school would look ""very different"" for her pupils. She said the school will have five separate entrances for each of its ""year group bubbles"", and that children will only move to different classrooms for specific subjects such as PE and design and technology. Ms Carter said she expected to have to persuade some parents that the site ""is as secure as we can make it, and children do need to come back to school"". ""It's been a long time, they need to re-engage with their learning - and it's also the issue of mental health. Children need to be back in the classroom where teachers are best placed to look after them and help them make the progress they need for their learning,"" she said. In Scotland, where pupils returned to classrooms this month, there has been criticism from pupils and parentsabout safety measures and the ability to maintain social distancing. And a school in Edinburgh has told pupils and staff to wear face coveringswhile moving around between lessons. The World Health Organization has said children aged 12 and overshould wear masks in line with national recommendations, citing evidence suggesting teenagers can infect others in the same way as adults. Children's minister Vicky Ford told Times Radio that children ""should not normally need to wear face masks"" at school because if they form small bubbles with other children, it is clear who their close contacts are. ""That's very different than for example if you were on public transport or if you were out in a shopping place, where you don't know who you are mixing with,"" she said. ""In the school setting, the children and young people will be kept in their consistent groups - and that means if there was an outbreak, it can be very quickly managed.""

This video can not be played Chris Whitty: ""We have still got a really serious challenge... for at least the next nine months"" Prof Whitty said he would be ""quite surprised if we had a highly effective vaccine ready for mass use in a large percentage of the population before the end of winter, certainly before this side of Christmas"".

"Travellers returning from Croatia and Austria will have to self-isolate in the UK from this weekend, but Portugal is now on the list of countries exempt from quarantine. Here are some readers questions about the latest travel rules. You will not need to quarantine when returning from Dublin. However, the UK is currently on Ireland's ""orange"" list. This means that once you get to Dublin, you will need to restrict your movement as much as possible. This includes only going to shops and the pharmacy in exceptional circumstances, and you are not advised to see others. No, you don't need to quarantine when you get into France. However, you will have to when you come back to the UK for 14 days. Additionally, it is worth checking whether there are still any local lockdown rules in the region where you're going. All passengers landing in Greece must havea valid passenger landing form,external, which includes a QR code. This can be either printed or on your phone, according to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. It can take up to 14 days for coronavirus symptoms to appear, according to the Department of Health and Social Care. The period between catching the virus and showing symptoms is known as the incubation period. During incubation a test might not be effective at picking up symptoms. You should try and organise the funeral remotely as much as possible and ask friends or family to help wherever possible. However, the government guidelines do allow for you to leave the house to attend a funeral during quarantine. Remember, funerals are currently subject to their own strict rules, including a maximum 30-person limit. It's not entirely clear. At the moment, the government does not publish the criteria for its decisions regarding quarantine, although it is thought to take into account a number of factors, such as the number of people affected, the number of deaths and the country's testing capacity. Croatia was put on the list because it has recently seen a spike in infections. There have been calls for more transparency about the process. Earlier this month, MPs on the Home Affairs Select Committee urged the government to publish the analysis behind its decisions, saying: ""It will build more support for the difficult balancing judgements it has to take if it is open about the evidence behind them."" People enjoyed sunny weather on this Dubrovnik beach this week Not necessarily. If you travel through the Netherlands and you don't stop in the country, you will not need to self-isolate when you return to the UK. If you do make a stop in the Netherlands, you can still avoid quarantine if: no new people get into the vehicle nobody gets out of the car, mixes with people and then gets back into the car Travellers from affected countries - including UK nationals - are asked to provide an address where they will self-isolate for 14 days. They can be fined Â£100 for failing to provide these details. One in five eligible passengers will be called or texted to check they are following the rules. People who do not self-isolate can be fined up to Â£1,000 in England, Wales and Northern Ireland and Â£480 in Scotland. There are fines up to Â£5,000 for persistent offenders. You do not need to isolate but your parents do, if they are returning from a country on the quarantine list. Moving out would be one solution to this, but you could stay at home as long as you are able to avoid contact with each other as much as possible. Government advice to people self-isolating,externalsays: ""It's important to avoid as much contact with other people as possible in your home in order to reduce the risk of transmitting coronavirus. You should stay in a well-ventilated room with a window to the outside that can be opened, separate from other people in your home."" As your parents will not be able to leave home (except for emergencies) during the self-isolation period, they may be glad of your assistance bringing food shopping to the house, for instance. UK tourists face new quarantine deadline race What are the UK travel quarantine rules? What are the UK's travel rules and which countries can you visit? Yes she does. Anyone who arrives in the UK from Portugal before 0400 BST on 22 August still has to self-isolate for two weeks. If you are already self-isolating, you need to continue doing so for 14 days after you arrived in the UK. The Department for Transport (DfT) says that 04:00 BST is a quiet time for flights, so there's less chance of travel disruption. With countries such as Croatia, Austria or - to take those added to the quarantine list last week - France and the Netherlands, the public health risks were not considered so high that quarantine needed to be introduced immediately. By allowing 36 hours' notice, the DfT said it could give travellers as much notice as possible and allow quarantine to be implemented successfully.

of today's play, then you can watch Today at the Test starts on the BBC iPlayer. We'll be back tomorrow morning. Goodbye! Michael VaughanEx-England captain on BBC Test Match Special For many years I've been criticising the England Test team for underachieveing with the bat. Over the last year, since that first innings at Headingley where they got blown away, I reckon the penny dropped that they can't play Test match cricket like this. The right way to play is to bat a long period of time in the first innings, and I think they're starting to see a bit of the reward of that. They're not the finished article, but I see big scores in this team. BBC Test Match Special England batsman Zak Crawley: ""The Test match in Cape Town was a pretty good feeling but scoring a double hundred for England was beyond my dreams. It's a very good day.""

Michael VaughanEx-England captain on BBC Test Match Special England have played the best two days of Test match cricket that I've seen for a long, long time. It's been high-class, attritional, really grinding the opposition into the dirt. The past five or six years, England haven't had that mentality of grinding them into the dirt. This is the first time I have seen it, and that is a great sign. BBC Test Match Special More from Jos Buttler:""Jimmy bowled fantastically well. He's pretty good in those situations. It's going to be tough facing him towards the end of the day. ""Jofra looks fresh, doesn't he? That was exciting to see. ""We need to come out and bowl well. We don't need to force it, and stay patient."" Michael VaughanEx-England captain on BBC Test Match Special We're used to Jos Buttler crashing it around but today he played a pure Test match innings. He was happy to let Crawley play the bigger strokes. I think that's a sign of a batsman maturing at this level. And I liked the fact that he got to a hundred and didn't give it away. I like to see players keep batting and stay in the here and now. BBC Test Match Special England wicketkeeper Jos Buttler:""It was a pleasure to be part of. Zak played an incredibly special knock. We talk as a side about big first-innings runs. To do that and then the wickets tonight, it's a really great day for us. ""I was  very happy to play second fiddle to Zak who was scoring all around the wicket. He made the margin for error very small. It was great to watch. Not many guys hit the ball as cleanly as he does."" Michael VaughanEx-England captain on BBC Test Match Special England have been exceptional over the course of two days. They have played with great control, power at the right times. Jos Buttler played a pure Test match innings. Zak Crawley, speaking to Sky Sports:""It's humbling to be on the list of England's top scorers, I don't see myself anywhere near their calibre, hopefully I can build on this."" Michael VaughanEx-England captain on BBC Test Match Special What a couple of days. Jonathan AgnewBBC cricket correspondent on Test Match Special A terrific session for England, and for Anderson. Pakistan are reeling. They're 559 runs behind England. Pak 24-3 It's not just Babar Azam making his way back, they all are. That's it, close of play for the day. After Zak Crawley's fantastic 267 and Jos Buttler's fine 140, James Anderson does what he does best, picking up three Pakistan wickets.

Jonathan AgnewBBC cricket correspondent on Test Match Special It's flicked the elbow. A very good decision. Pak 24-2 Replays show it just flicked Azhar's elbow on it's way through to Buttler. The umpire's decision of not out stands. I did hear a noise but it didn't sound woody. Joe Root seemed the most convinced out of the England fielders. Jonathan AgnewBBC cricket correspondent on Test Match Special I didn't hear anything. Jofra said he didn't hear anything at all.

"Pupils will have to wear masks indoors as they move between classes, like these Dutch teenagers Pupils and staff at a secondary school in Edinburgh have been told to wear face coverings as part of efforts to combat the spread of coronavirus. From Monday, teachers and pupils at James Gillespie's High School ""must wear face coverings indoors whilst moving around between classes"". The school said it followed feedback from pupils, staff and parents. It comes after pictures emerged on social media showing high school pupils in crowded corridors. Where have school pupils tested positive for Covid-19? Children are not currently required to wear masks in school, but on Thursday, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said secondary school studentsmay be required to wear face coverings in the ""near future"". Pupils, staff and parents were involved in the decision at James Gillespie's High School The EIS trade union, which represents teachers, has been calling on ministers to issue ""stronger advice on face coverings, where physical distancing is not possible"". Union leaders highlight that while wearing face coverings is now mandatory in places such as museums, there is no such regulation for schools. The school said masks, face coverings and visors would be available free of charge to anyone who had lost or forgotten their own. A Scottish government spokesman said: ""The safety and wellbeing of pupils and school staff is a top priority, and the guidance published ahead of the new term sets out clearly what health mitigations should be in place in schools. ""The situation is being closely monitored and we continue to review any emerging scientific evidence that will help us to protect our school community, including on the use of face coverings. ""In the meantime, our guidance provides for schools to adopt a precautionary approach depending on their individual circumstances.""

"This video can not be played Coronavirus: How to wear a face covering The World Health Organization (WHO) has issued guidance saying children over the age of 12 should wear masks, in line with recommended practice for adults in their country or area. It admits little is known about how children transmit the virus but cites evidence that teenagers can infect others in the same way as adults. Children aged five and under should not normally wear masks, the WHO said. More than 800,000 people have now died with coronavirus worldwide. At least 23 million cases of infection have been registered,external, according to Johns Hopkins University, with most of them recorded in the US, Brazil and India. However the true number of people who have had the virus is believed to be far higher, due to insufficient testing and asymptomatic cases. The numbers have been rising again in countries as diverse as South Korea, EU states and Lebanon. Why Spain is seeing second Covid wave New study shows more women in Delhi had Covid Where are the world's coronavirus hotspots? WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has said he hopes the pandemic will beover in two yearsbut a top scientific adviser in the UK warnedCovid-19 might never be eradicated, with people needing regular vaccinations. Theadvice published on the WHO website,externalcovers three age groups: Children aged 12 and overshould wear a mask under the same conditions as adults, in particular when they cannot guarantee a distance of at least one metre from others and there is widespread transmission in the area Forchildren aged between six and 11, the WHO advises taking into account how widespread the transmission of the virus is and whether the child is interacting with high-risk individuals such as the elderly. It also stresses the need for adult supervision to help children use, put on and take off masks safely Children aged five and undershould not, under normal circumstances, wear masks A child in a mask on the Wall Street Bull this week For teachers, the WHO says: ""In areas where there is widespread transmission, all adults under the age of 60 and who are in general good health should wear fabric masks when they cannot guarantee at least a one-metre distance from others. ""This is particularly important for adults working with children who may have close contact with children and one another."" Adults aged 60 or over, or those with underlying health conditions, should wear medical masks, it says. The WHO guidance does not specify whether a child over the age of 12 should wear a mask in school, but it may yet become a feature of the classroom as the new academic year begins. France recently made it mandatory for all children over 11,external, and a number of schools in the UK are taking it upon themselves to require students to wear them even though this is notofficial government guidance,external. James Gillespie's High School in Edinburgh is one such school, making the decision to require students to ""wear face coverings indoors whilst moving around between classes""after taking feedback from pupils, staff and parents.

"Tim Bendzko performed at all three ""concerts"" Scientists in Germany have held three pop concerts in a single day to investigate the risks posed by mass indoor events during the pandemic. About 1,500 healthy volunteers aged between 18 and 50 - only a third of the expected number - took part. But the head of the study, which was carried out in Leipzig by Halle University, said he was ""very satisfied"" with how the event unfolded. Singer-songwriter Tim Bendzko agreed to perform at all three successive gigs. The study came as Germany recorded its highest number of Covid-19 infections since the end of April. More than 2,000 cases were recorded in the last 24 hours, bringing thetotal number of cases to 232,082, the Robert Koch Institute reported.,external Thousands protest against Germany virus curbs Where are the world's coronavirus hotspots? The concert study, called Restart-19,external, was created ""to investigate the conditions under which such events can be carried out despite the pandemic"", researchers said. The first of Saturday's three concerts aimed to simulate an event before the pandemic, with no safety measures in place. The second involved greater hygiene and some social distancing, while the third involved half the numbers and each person standing 1.5m apart. All participants were tested for Covid-19 before taking part, and given face masks and tracking devices to measure their distancing. Researchers reportedly also used fluorescent disinfectants to track which surfaces audience members touched the most. ""The data collection is going very well, so we have good quality data, the mood is great and we are extremely satisfied with the discipline in wearing masks and using disinfectant,"" lead researcher Dr Stefan Moritz said. Each of the three events had different levels of social distancing Singer Tim Bendzko, meanwhile, said the event had exceeded his expectations. ""We really enjoyed it. At first I thought it would be very sterile because of the masks, but it felt surprisingly good,"" he said. ""I hope that these results will help us to hold real concerts in front of an audience again soon."" The initial results of the study are expected in the autumn. Concert-goers wore protective face masks The project received 990,000 euros (Â£892,000, $1.17m) in funding from the states of Saxony-Anhalt and Saxony with the aim of helping to pave the way for the resumption of major indoor sporting and music events by ascertaining realistic levels of risk. ""The corona pandemic is paralyzing the event industry,"" Saxony-Anhalt's Minister of Economics and Science, Prof Armin Willingmann, said before the event. ""As long as there is a risk of infection, major concerts, trade fairs and sporting events cannot take place.

"The ruins of the village of Oradour-sur-Glane are preserved as a memorial site French President Emmanuel Macron has condemned as ""unspeakable"" the defacing of a memorial at the site of one of the worst atrocities carried out by the Nazis in France during World War Two. Images of an inscription at the site in the village of Oradour-sur-Glane show the word ""martyr"" in the text ""martyr village"" replaced with ""liar"". The village was destroyed by SS troops in 1944, with 642 inhabitants killed. The old village's ruins are preserved just as they were after the massacre. After the war, a new village was built nearby. Philippe Lacroix, the mayor of Oradour-sur-Glane, said he was shocked, adding: ""We know what happened here but obviously there are always people who try to tell lies."" Mr Macron said that everything would be done to track down and punish those responsible for the vandalism. The act has been widely condemned by French officials. Jewish graves in France defaced with Nazi symbols France warns of steep rise in anti-Semitism Prime Minister Jean Castex said he felt ""anger"" when he heard of the incident. ""To soil this place... is also to soil the memory of our martyrs,"" he said. ""Shame on those who did this,"" Justice Minister Eric Dupond-Moretti tweeted. French Interior Minister GÃ©rald Darmanin described the vandalism as ""spitting on the memory of our martyrs"". On 10 June 1944, a detachment of SS troops surrounded the tiny hamlet of Oradour-sur-Glane in the Limousin region of south-central France. It is believed by some that the troops were seeking retribution for the kidnap of a German soldier but some say that resistance members were based in a different, nearby village. SS man faces incitement probe over massacre France's last Resistance hero from World War Two No trial over Nazi massacre case Most of the victims were women and children. Many of them were herded into a local church into which hand grenades were thrown before it was set on fire. The men were locked in a barn. Machine-gunners shot at their legs, then doused them in petrol and set them alight. An investigation years later saw some 60 soldiers brought to trial in the 1950s. Twenty of them were convicted but all were later released. 'Like an atomic bomb': Los Angeles fire chiefs warn death toll is likely to rise What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

"The National Trust, which has 5.6 million members, looks after properties around the country The National Trust's director general has denied the charity will ""dumb down"" after a leaked document suggested many top experts could lose their jobs as a result of coronavirus. The heritage charityis facing Â£200m of lossesafter closing its shops, cafes, houses and gardens during the pandemic. Hilary McGrady said the charity was finding ""creative ways"" to save money. But she added: ""We simply can't afford to keep doing everything the way we were before."" An internal briefing document,leaked by the Times,externalnewspaper, outlines plans for the charity to ""dial down"" its role as a major cultural institution - including holding fewer exhibitions and putting collections into storage in favour of becoming a ""gateway to the outdoors"". National Trust plans 1,200 job cuts National Trust 'faces Â£200m losses this year' Covid funding boost saves 200 National Trust jobs Ms McGrady toldBBC Radio 4's Today programmeshe could ""understand why"" documents had been leaked, because people were ""very anxious"" about their jobs. Some1,200 National Trust staff were told they faced redundancy- about 13% of the 9,500-strong salaried workforce - last month. Ms McGrady said on Saturday that a large number of ""seasonal"" hourly-paid staff would also lose work. It is not clear how many seasonal staff would be affected but a spokeswoman said the charity would reduce its budget for those workers by a third (Â£8.8m). Ms McGrady said she was ""hugely sad"" at having to propose losing any staff but that the charity had been hit ""extraordinarily badly by Covid-19"". SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? HOLIDAYS:Will I get a summer break? FACE MASKS:When should you wear one? TESTING:Who can get a test and how? She dismissed a suggestion the trust would be ""dumbed down"" as a result of arts specialists losing their jobs. More jobs would be cut in areas such as the charity's marketing and catering sectors in order to maintain roles in houses and gardens, she said - with 80 of 111 people with ""curator"" in their job title expected to stay in position. But Ms McGrady added: ""I cannot pretend that we're going to keep them all because we simply can't afford to keep doing everything the way we were before."" ""This is a really serious thing that we are going through at the moment."" The National Trust closed its houses, such as Blickling Hall and Estate, to visitors to help to tackle the spread of coronavirus The National Trust is the UK's largest conservation charity and looks after more than 300 historic houses and almost 800 miles of coastline across England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Ms McGrady said the charity's main aims in the face of its ""financial stress"" were to preserve its houses and outdoor spaces ""to the best of our ability"", and to reduce the impact of cuts to visitors' experiences. The National Trust's 5.6 million members would be able to share their thoughts and have some input before proposals were confirmed, she added.

"Tim Bendzko performed at all three ""concerts"" Scientists in Germany have held three pop concerts in a single day to investigate the risks posed by mass indoor events during the pandemic. About 1,500 healthy volunteers aged between 18 and 50 - only a third of the expected number - took part. But the head of the study, which was carried out in Leipzig by Halle University, said he was ""very satisfied"" with how the event unfolded. Singer-songwriter Tim Bendzko agreed to perform at all three successive gigs. The study came as Germany recorded its highest number of Covid-19 infections since the end of April. More than 2,000 cases were recorded in the last 24 hours, bringing thetotal number of cases to 232,082, the Robert Koch Institute reported.,external Thousands protest against Germany virus curbs Where are the world's coronavirus hotspots? The concert study, called Restart-19,external, was created ""to investigate the conditions under which such events can be carried out despite the pandemic"", researchers said. The first of Saturday's three concerts aimed to simulate an event before the pandemic, with no safety measures in place. The second involved greater hygiene and some social distancing, while the third involved half the numbers and each person standing 1.5m apart. All participants were tested for Covid-19 before taking part, and given face masks and tracking devices to measure their distancing. Researchers reportedly also used fluorescent disinfectants to track which surfaces audience members touched the most. ""The data collection is going very well, so we have good quality data, the mood is great and we are extremely satisfied with the discipline in wearing masks and using disinfectant,"" lead researcher Dr Stefan Moritz said. Each of the three events had different levels of social distancing Singer Tim Bendzko, meanwhile, said the event had exceeded his expectations. ""We really enjoyed it. At first I thought it would be very sterile because of the masks, but it felt surprisingly good,"" he said. ""I hope that these results will help us to hold real concerts in front of an audience again soon."" The initial results of the study are expected in the autumn. Concert-goers wore protective face masks The project received 990,000 euros (Â£892,000, $1.17m) in funding from the states of Saxony-Anhalt and Saxony with the aim of helping to pave the way for the resumption of major indoor sporting and music events by ascertaining realistic levels of risk. ""The corona pandemic is paralyzing the event industry,"" Saxony-Anhalt's Minister of Economics and Science, Prof Armin Willingmann, said before the event. ""As long as there is a risk of infection, major concerts, trade fairs and sporting events cannot take place. This is why it is so important to find out which technical and organisational conditions can effectively minimise the risks.""

"Navalny was taken by ambulance to the airport in Omsk on Saturday morning The acutely ill Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny has arrived in Germany from Siberia for treatment. He is in a coma after drinking what his supporters suspect was poisoned tea; they accuse the authorities of trying to conceal a crime. Doctors treating him in Omsk had insisted on Friday that he was too ill to be moved. But they later said his condition was stable enough for the flight. His wife Yulia travelled with him. On Saturday morning, Mr Navalny's medical evacuation flight - paid for by the German non-governmental organisation Cinema for Peace - landed at Tegel airport in Berlin. He is being treated at the German capital's CharitÃ© hospital, which has said it does not expect to release a statement about his condition before Monday. The founder of the Cinema for Peace Foundation, activist and filmmaker Jaka Bizilj, told reporters outside the hospital that Mr Navalny's condition was ""very worrying"". ""It's not only about the question if he will survive this,"" he said. ""It's a question what kind of damage there is, if he will survive this and come back to normal fully."" Mr Navalny is in a coma on life support Mr Navalny's personal doctor, Anastasia Vasilieva, was not allowed to see him while he was in hospital in Russia. But she said she was hopeful he could recover now that he was in Germany. ""I'm sure that they can treat him and do everything to eliminate this toxic agent from his body."" Medical staff treating Mr Navalny at the hospital in Omsk said before his flight that his life was not in immediate danger. Mr Navalny's spokeswoman, Kira Yarmysh, earlier tweeted: ""Massive thanks to everyone for their support. The struggle for Alexei's life and health is just beginning."" Ms Yarmysh said it was a pity that doctors had taken so long to approve his flight as the plane and the right documents had been ready since Friday morning. The medical evacuation flight arrived at Tegel airport in Berlin on Saturday morning Mr Navalny fell ill during a flight from Tomsk to Moscow on Thursday, and his plane made an emergency landing in Omsk. A photograph on social media appeared to show him drinking from a cup at a Tomsk airport cafe before the flight. His team suspects a poisonous substance was put in his tea. Disturbing video appeared to show a stricken Mr Navalny howling in agony on the flight. Passenger Pavel Lebedev said he had heard the activist ""screaming in pain"". The head doctor at the hospital where Mr Navalny was being treated in Omsk, Alexander Murakhovsky, warned late on Friday that doctors did not recommend flying ""but his wife insists on her husband being transferred to a German clinic"". ""The patient's condition is stable,"" deputy chief doctor Anatoly Kalinichenko was quoted as saying by the Interfax news agency. Russia's vociferous Putin critic Mr Navalny fell ill during a flight on Thursday ""As we're in possession of a request from relatives to permit him to be transported somewhere, we have now taken the decision that we do not object to his transfer to another in-patient facility,"" Dr Kalinichenko said. Doctors said earlier that no poison had been found in his body, suggesting his condition might be the result of a ""metabolic disorder"" caused by low blood sugar. Health officials then indicated that traces of an industrial chemical had been found on his skin and hair. The local interior ministry told the Rapsi legal news agency thatthe chemical was usually included in polymers to improve their elasticity,external, but its concentration was impossible to establish. The prominent critic of President Vladimir Putin has consistently exposed official corruption in Russia. He has served multiple jail terms. At a news conference in Berlin on Friday, Mr Navalny's aide Leonid Volkov said at first doctors at the hospital had been helping to facilitate his transfer but had abruptly stopped doing so. Medical experts from Germany were allowed to see Mr Navalny ""[It was] like something was switched off - like medicine mode off, cover-up operation mode on - and the doctors refused to co-operate any more, refused to give any information even to Alexei's wife,"" he said. ""The doctors who were helping to do the paperwork to make the transportation of Alexei to CharitÃ© possible started to say that he's not any more transportable, he's not any more stable, contradicting themselves."" In 2018, the Cinema for Peace Foundation arranged for the treatment of Pyotr Verzilov - an activist with Russian protest group Pussy Riot - who had symptoms of poisoning. Mr Verzilov's ex-wife, activist Nadya Tolokonnikova, told BBC News that Mr Navalny's condition resembled the ""poisoning"" of her ex-husband. ""What German doctors told me after not finding poison in my ex-husband's blood is that the poison disappears in three days. So the Russian doctors only let him go when they were sure there was no traces of poison left,"" she explained. She also expressed surprise about what has happened to Mr Navalny: ""I thought Alexei was so powerful as a political figure that Mr Putin would not interfere."" Mr Navalny's wife Yulia wrote to President Putin asking him to allow her husband to be moved. She feared the Russian authorities were stalling so that evidence of any chemical substance would be lost. Mr Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Thursday that the Kremlin would help move Mr Navalny abroad if necessary and wished him a ""speedy recovery"". On Friday he said it was purely a medical decision. Foreign leaders including Germany's Angela Merkel and France's Emmanuel Macron have expressed concern for Mr Navalny. In the US, Democratic presidential candidateJoe Biden has described the incident as ""unacceptable"",externaland vowed that, if elected, he would ""stand up to autocrats like Putin"". After Mr Navalny was flown to Germany,UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab tweeted,external: ""It is vital that there is a full & transparent investigation into his poisoning."" April 2017:He was taken to hospital afteran antiseptic green dye was splashed on his facein Moscow. It was the second time he was targeted with zelyonka (""brilliant green"" in English) that year. ""It looks funny but it hurts like hell,"" he tweeted following the attack. This video can not be played Footage appears to show Mr Navalny being attacked with a green liquid in 2017 July 2019:He was sentenced to 30 days in prison after calling for unauthorised protests. He fell ill in jail and doctors said he had suffered an acute allergic reaction, diagnosing him with ""contact dermatitis"". His own doctor suggested he might have been exposed to ""some toxic agent"" and Mr Navalny saidhe thought he might have been poisoned.

As face masks are becoming mandatory in an increasing number of settings around the world, you might have noticed that not everyone is clear about how they should be worn. Here's a quick reminder from BBC health correspondent Laura Foster about the dos and donts of face coverings. This video can not be played How not to wear a face mask The Czech Republic has become the latest European country to announce the highest number of cases since the pandemic began. On Saturday the country recorded 506 new infections - though the health ministry said the increase was due to increased testing, especially among the contacts of people who had tested positive. Prague and Central Bohemia reported the greatest number of cases. Poland and Slovakia also announced their own record figures on Friday, with 903 and 123 cases respectively, while Spain, Italy and France have also seen sharp increases in recent days. Eleven German soldiers have tested positive for coronavirus in Iraq. According to the German army, 10 soldiers were repatriated on Friday. Another man was confirmed to have the virus on Saturday and preparations for his return home are under way. All of the soldiers were in Iraq as part of a non-combat support mission aimed at countering Islamic State. The news comes as the number of infections in Iraq passed 200,000. The country has reported around 4,000 new daily cases for more than a week, according to AFP news agency, with fears that numbers could rise due to an upcoming major Shia religious festival. No, this isn't an old photo - this is Tim Bendzko performing at a Restart-19 concert today Tim Bendzko, a singer-songwriter who became famous after winning Germany's Bundesvision song contest, is headlining all three coronavirus concerts in the city of Leipzig. As we reported earlier, the concerts - called Restart-19 - are being staged as a massive experiment in which scientists will investigate how the virus spreads in mass indoor events. The first concert is being staged as it would have been before the pandemic, the second one with more hygiene measures and social distancing, and the third with half the numbers and people standing 1.5m apart. Everyone taking part is healthy, aged 18 to 50 and has tested negative for coronavirus. The study by Halle University comes after Germany recorded its highest number of new Covid-19 infections since the end of April. More than 2,000 cases were recorded in the last 24 hours, bringing the total number of infections up to 232,082, the Robert Koch Institute reported. The Slovak football team Slovan Bratislava has gone into quarantine on the Faroe Islands after two of its players tested positive for coronavirus. The governing body for European football, Uefa, said in a statement that the entire team had tested negative before travelling to the remote North Atlantic archipelago. Further testing on arrival showed that one player was infected, leading to their match against Faroese team KÃ KlaksvÃ­k being delayed from 19 to 21 August. Additional players who had also tested negative were put forward to play on the new date - but a member of this second group later tested positive, prompting local officials to place all of Slovan Bratislava's staff and players in quarantine. It is not known where the players contracted the virus. Buta study published by Johns Hopkins University,externalsuggested that testing people too soon after they were infected could lead to a false negative results. Summer is usually a busy time for food trucks in the US, particularly with festivals. But this year, of course, everything's different. According to theAssociated Press,externalnews agency, food trucks in Seattle have found an alternative way to keep afloat - by driving to the suburbs. People in residential areas are glad of the opportunity not to cook, and treat getting food from the trucks as an excuse to spend some time outdoors with their neighbours, the report says. ""This is festival season, fun season,"" Matt Geller, president of the National Food Truck Association, told AP. ""All the stuff we typically do as humans, we can't do anymore. Walking out to a food truck is a taste of normalcy, and it feels really good.""

Ganesh Chaturthi usually involves huge processions, after which idols of Lord Ganesha are submerged in water. But celebrations are low key this year, as large gatherings are prohibited. We reported earlier today that India saw a record increase in infections, pushing the total number of confirmed cases in the country close to three million. Hindus pray to Lord Ganesha for protection - and so, many idols this year depict him crushing the coronavirus, wearing masks and carrying hand sanitiser, such as this one in Ahmedabad This idol in Mumbai also shows Lord Ganesha destroying the coronavirus Priests have also performed pujas - Hindu prayer ceremonies - while wearing masks Worshippers have also adhered to social distancing in temples Job losses and a shift to remote working during lockdown have led many young people to leave London.

The new advice says those aged 12 and over ""should wear a mask under the same conditions as adults, in particular when they cannot guarantee at least a one-metre distance from others and there is widespread transmission in the area"". Younger children could be asked to wear face coverings depending on the situation, the guidance adds, but in general children aged five and under ""should not be required to wear masks"".

A foreign tourist being tested in Zagreb The UK decision to add Croatia to its quarantine list ""not fair"", a Croatian government official has said. Frano Matusic, state secretary at the country's tourism ministry, called on the UK to reverse the move. ""It is true that we have some several hotspots in Croatia but we didnât register until now any infection in hotels, camps and other accommodation facilities,"" he told Sky News. ""So we appeal to UK government to replace this 14-days quarantine measure by reliable tests. We are really disappointed by this."" Read more about Croatia's addition to the list and other questionshere. When the pandemic was first declared in March, amid closing borders and trade routes, people all over the world tried and failed to get hold of face masks. Now, some countries are facing the opposite problem. According to a report in French newspaperLe Monde,external, companies in France that rushed to produce face coverings at the start of the outbreak are now left with large amounts of unsold stock - even though masks are mandatory in many public places in the country. This, the paper says, is because demand has collapsed since May, while trade with manufacturers in China and Vietnam has reopened. ""It is estimated that there are 100 million consumer masks available for sale in the country,"" Yves Dubief, president of the Union des Industries Textiles (Textile Industries Union), told the paper, adding that it ""will take time"" to get through the stocks. People await testing in Mostoles, near Madrid, on Saturday As UK tourists travelling home from Croatia, Austria and Trinidad and Tobago prepare to face two weeks of quarantine, it is interesting to compare numbers of current cases across Europe. As of 22 August,the UK had recorded 21.2 coronavirus cases per 100,000 people over the last fortnight,external, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). In comparison, Croatia had 52.2 cases per 100,000, Austria had 34.6 and France had 54.4. Spain recorded the highest number, at 152.7, although the ECDC says this number includes cases from the previous 14 days. Malta was also high, with 119.5 cases per 100,000. By contrast, Italy's cases were 12.1 per 100,000, and Latvia recorded the lowest number of cases at 2.6. The ECDC urges caution with the data, saying it may not be fully accurate because of the different times that national updates are published.

Workplaces, childcare facilities and businesses, including pubs and restaurants, will remain open. Under the new rules, introduced on Saturday, residents are advised to only use public transport for essential travel. Restaurants are advised to only cater for pre-booked customers, with a maximum of six people per table. Residents can also attend the weddings, civil partnerships and funerals of members of their household and close family, with ceremonies limited to 20 people Schools are still set to open from 1 September. The new ban on socialising will apply to the following areas of Blackburn with Darwen: Audley & Queen's Park, Bastwell & Daisyfield, Billinge & Beardwood, Blackburn Central, Little Harwood & Whitebirk, Roe Lee, Shear Brow & Corporation Park, Wensley Fold. Areas in Blackburn with Darwen where extra restrictions have been lifted are: Blackburn South & Lower Darwen, Blackburn South East, Darwen East, Darwen South, Darwen West, Ewood, Livesey with Pleasington, Mill Hill & Moorgate, West Pennine Restrictions in Pendle remain but the new socialising ban applies to the following areas: Whitefield, Walverden, Southfield, Bradley, Clover Hill, Brierfield, Marsden The new guidelines were leaked to a local newspaper before the government's official confirmation on Friday afternoon. Sean Fielding, leader of Oldham Council, said it was looking to provide clarity to residents ""because the announcement itself from the government wasn't the smoothest"". Mohammed Iqbal, leader of Pendle Council, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""The government has announced these tightening restrictions for local people in my area, yet they have not issued any detailed guidance as to how it will operate, who will police it. ""So local people are actually more confused than they were on Thursday evening."" Shoppers, pictured here in Manchester, are seen as part of the economic recovery On Saturday,Greater Manchester Police issued a social media post,externalurging people not to call 999 or 101 for clarification about the measures. However,the force were criticised on social media,externalafter they issued a fixed penalty notice to a homeowner who had hosted a child's birthday party in a garden, attended by three families. A police spokesman said: ""This was one of several breaches of Covid-19 regulations that were publicised to demonstrate the breadth of incidents GMP have been called to in just one night."" Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham said police were ""in a no-win situation because sometimes they get criticised for not doing enough and then when they do enforce the measures they get criticism back"". Since July, the government has been introducing extra restrictions in parts of northern England after a spike in coronavirus cases. The tighter rules will be removed in Wigan, Darwen and Rossendale on Wednesday after they recorded lower infection rates than other areas. Residents in those towns will be required to follow national guidance, including social distancing and wearing a face covering where appropriate. However, the extra restrictions will remain for the rest of Greater Manchester and East Lancashire, plus Preston, where gatherings ofseparate households are banned in most circumstances,external. How many confirmed cases are there in your area? A government spokesman said the ""sharp rise"" in confirmed cases was partly due to a major increase in testing led by local councils. He added the spike ""continues to be due to social mixing between younger age groups of 20-39 year olds"". Dr Sakthi Karunanithi, public health director at Lancashire County Council, said: ""The vast majority - more than 80% - of coronavirus transmission (in the affected parts of Pendle and Blackburn) is as a result of households mixing. ""That's why we are putting out a very clear message - do not socialise with people you don't live with."" The new rules came into force in Oldham, and parts of Pendle and Blackburn on Saturday Mohammed Khan, leader of Blackburn with Darwen Council, said the borough, which launched a local contact-tracing service earlier in August, would continue ""our important work fighting this infection at a really local level"". ""We know that our residents have been making huge sacrifices and that businesses are struggling. ""We desperately needed to prevent the threat of a full, borough-wide lockdown as this would have been devastating."" Mr Burnham said: ""We have been able to keep businesses open in Oldham and that's a significant victory for the council because they were worried about the fragility of the economy. ""So what we have got instead are more targeted measuresâ¦ which are much better than going into a lockdown situation where businesses have to close."" Mr Burnham said there had been ""a noticeable fall in cases this week"" in Oldham and other parts of Greater Manchester. ""Fingers crossed, we can see more boroughs released from these measures soon."" Pakistan cricket captain Azhar Ali is among celebrities who will promote the new guidelines Mr Fielding said Oldham Council had closed at least one pub since Friday for flouting the rules. He said the council had also enlisted celebrities such as Pakistan cricket captain Azhar Ali, who is currently playing  in a Test Match series against England, and The Inbetweeners actor James Buckley ""to get the message out to communities that might listen to [them] rather than listen to me."" ""We are also doing some really targeted intervention in our most affected communities, and that includes things like door-to-door testing, using community leaders to get messages over."" Earlier this week, the council shared a clip of Game Of Thrones actor James Cosmo warning residents that ""lockdown is coming"" unless they abide by guidelines. Elsewhere,Birmingham has been added to the government's watch list,and Northampton named an ""area of intervention"".

"The ruins of the village of Oradour-sur-Glane are preserved as a memorial site French President Emmanuel Macron has condemned as ""unspeakable"" the defacing of a memorial at the site of one of the worst atrocities carried out by the Nazis in France during World War Two. Images of an inscription at the site in the village of Oradour-sur-Glane show the word ""martyr"" in the text ""martyr village"" replaced with ""liar"". The village was destroyed by SS troops in 1944, with 642 inhabitants killed. The old village's ruins are preserved just as they were after the massacre. After the war, a new village was built nearby. Philippe Lacroix, the mayor of Oradour-sur-Glane, said he was shocked, adding: ""We know what happened here but obviously there are always people who try to tell lies."" Mr Macron said that everything would be done to track down and punish those responsible for the vandalism. The act has been widely condemned by French officials. Jewish graves in France defaced with Nazi symbols France warns of steep rise in anti-Semitism Prime Minister Jean Castex said he felt ""anger"" when he heard of the incident. ""To soil this place... is also to soil the memory of our martyrs,"" he said. ""Shame on those who did this,"" Justice Minister Eric Dupond-Moretti tweeted. French Interior Minister GÃ©rald Darmanin described the vandalism as ""spitting on the memory of our martyrs"". On 10 June 1944, a detachment of SS troops surrounded the tiny hamlet of Oradour-sur-Glane in the Limousin region of south-central France. It is believed by some that the troops were seeking retribution for the kidnap of a German soldier but some say that resistance members were based in a different, nearby village. SS man faces incitement probe over massacre France's last Resistance hero from World War Two No trial over Nazi massacre case Most of the victims were women and children. Many of them were herded into a local church into which hand grenades were thrown before it was set on fire. The men were locked in a barn. Machine-gunners shot at their legs, then doused them in petrol and set them alight. An investigation years later saw some 60 soldiers brought to trial in the 1950s. Twenty of them were convicted but all were later released. 'Like an atomic bomb': Los Angeles fire chiefs warn death toll is likely to rise What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

Filming of the reality TV show The Masked Singer has been suspended in Australia after a number of crew members tested positive for coronavirus. On Saturday, health officials confirmed that seven cases had been linked to the show's production in Melbourne. The programme, which was originally launched in South Korea in 2015 before sparking a number of international versions, features a panel of celebrities who attempt to guess the identity of mystery singers. The whole production team for the Australian version - including celebrity judges Danii Minogue and Jackie 'O' - has now been placed in quarantine, the show said in a statement. As face masks are becoming mandatory in an increasing number of settings around the world, you might have noticed that not everyone is clear about how they should be worn. Here's a quick reminder from BBC health correspondent Laura Foster about the dos and donts of face coverings. This video can not be played How not to wear a face mask The Czech Republic has become the latest European country to announce the highest number of cases since the pandemic began. On Saturday the country recorded 506 new infections - though the health ministry said the increase was due to increased testing, especially among the contacts of people who had tested positive. Prague and Central Bohemia reported the greatest number of cases. Poland and Slovakia also announced their own record figures on Friday, with 903 and 123 cases respectively, while Spain, Italy and France have also seen sharp increases in recent days. Eleven German soldiers have tested positive for coronavirus in Iraq. According to the German army, 10 soldiers were repatriated on Friday. Another man was confirmed to have the virus on Saturday and preparations for his return home are under way. All of the soldiers were in Iraq as part of a non-combat support mission aimed at countering Islamic State. The news comes as the number of infections in Iraq passed 200,000. The country has reported around 4,000 new daily cases for more than a week, according to AFP news agency, with fears that numbers could rise due to an upcoming major Shia religious festival. No, this isn't an old photo - this is Tim Bendzko performing at a Restart-19 concert today Tim Bendzko, a singer-songwriter who became famous after winning Germany's Bundesvision song contest, is headlining all three coronavirus concerts in the city of Leipzig. As we reported earlier, the concerts - called Restart-19 - are being staged as a massive experiment in which scientists will investigate how the virus spreads in mass indoor events. The first concert is being staged as it would have been before the pandemic, the second one with more hygiene measures and social distancing, and the third with half the numbers and people standing 1.5m apart. Everyone taking part is healthy, aged 18 to 50 and has tested negative for coronavirus. The study by Halle University comes after Germany recorded its highest number of new Covid-19 infections since the end of April. More than 2,000 cases were recorded in the last 24 hours, bringing the total number of infections up to 232,082, the Robert Koch Institute reported. The Slovak football team Slovan Bratislava has gone into quarantine on the Faroe Islands after two of its players tested positive for coronavirus. The governing body for European football, Uefa, said in a statement that the entire team had tested negative before travelling to the remote North Atlantic archipelago. Further testing on arrival showed that one player was infected, leading to their match against Faroese team KÃ KlaksvÃ­k being delayed from 19 to 21 August. Additional players who had also tested negative were put forward to play on the new date - but a member of this second group later tested positive, prompting local officials to place all of Slovan Bratislava's staff and players in quarantine. It is not known where the players contracted the virus. Buta study published by Johns Hopkins University,externalsuggested that testing people too soon after they were infected could lead to a false negative results. Summer is usually a busy time for food trucks in the US, particularly with festivals. But this year, of course, everything's different. According to theAssociated Press,externalnews agency, food trucks in Seattle have found an alternative way to keep afloat - by driving to the suburbs. People in residential areas are glad of the opportunity not to cook, and treat getting food from the trucks as an excuse to spend some time outdoors with their neighbours, the report says. ""This is festival season, fun season,"" Matt Geller, president of the National Food Truck Association, told AP. ""All the stuff we typically do as humans, we can't do anymore. Walking out to a food truck is a taste of normalcy, and it feels really good."" At least 800,000 people have died with coronavirus worldwide, according to the latest tally by Johns Hopkins University in the US. The US has seen the highest number of fatalities, with around 175,000 deaths, followed by Brazil, with 113,000. Almost 23 million infections have also been recorded since the pandemic began.

Ganesh Chaturthi usually involves huge processions, after which idols of Lord Ganesha are submerged in water. But celebrations are low key this year, as large gatherings are prohibited. We reported earlier today that India saw a record increase in infections, pushing the total number of confirmed cases in the country close to three million. Hindus pray to Lord Ganesha for protection - and so, many idols this year depict him crushing the coronavirus, wearing masks and carrying hand sanitiser, such as this one in Ahmedabad This idol in Mumbai also shows Lord Ganesha destroying the coronavirus Priests have also performed pujas - Hindu prayer ceremonies - while wearing masks Worshippers have also adhered to social distancing in temples Job losses and a shift to remote working during lockdown have led many young people to leave London.

This video can not be played London renting âfeels differentâ after lockdown The World Health Organization has updated its guidance to recommend children aged 12 and above wear face masks. The new advice says those aged 12 and over ""should wear a mask under the same conditions as adults, in particular when they cannot guarantee at least a one-metre distance from others and there is widespread transmission in the area"". Younger children could be asked to wear face coverings depending on the situation, the guidance adds, but in general children aged five and under ""should not be required to wear masks"". The WHO said people should always consult and follow local rules on masks.

A foreign tourist being tested in Zagreb The UK decision to add Croatia to its quarantine list ""not fair"", a Croatian government official has said. Frano Matusic, state secretary at the country's tourism ministry, called on the UK to reverse the move. ""It is true that we have some several hotspots in Croatia but we didnât register until now any infection in hotels, camps and other accommodation facilities,"" he told Sky News. ""So we appeal to UK government to replace this 14-days quarantine measure by reliable tests. We are really disappointed by this."" Read more about Croatia's addition to the list and other questionshere. When the pandemic was first declared in March, amid closing borders and trade routes, people all over the world tried and failed to get hold of face masks. Now, some countries are facing the opposite problem. According to a report in French newspaperLe Monde,external, companies in France that rushed to produce face coverings at the start of the outbreak are now left with large amounts of unsold stock - even though masks are mandatory in many public places in the country. This, the paper says, is because demand has collapsed since May, while trade with manufacturers in China and Vietnam has reopened. ""It is estimated that there are 100 million consumer masks available for sale in the country,"" Yves Dubief, president of the Union des Industries Textiles (Textile Industries Union), told the paper, adding that it ""will take time"" to get through the stocks. People await testing in Mostoles, near Madrid, on Saturday As UK tourists travelling home from Croatia, Austria and Trinidad and Tobago prepare to face two weeks of quarantine, it is interesting to compare numbers of current cases across Europe. As of 22 August,the UK had recorded 21.2 coronavirus cases per 100,000 people over the last fortnight,external, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). In comparison, Croatia had 52.2 cases per 100,000, Austria had 34.6 and France had 54.4. Spain recorded the highest number, at 152.7, although the ECDC says this number includes cases from the previous 14 days. Malta was also high, with 119.5 cases per 100,000. By contrast, Italy's cases were 12.1 per 100,000, and Latvia recorded the lowest number of cases at 2.6. The ECDC urges caution with the data, saying it may not be fully accurate because of the different times that national updates are published. The beaches of the Algarve: Back on the agenda for British holidaymakers As of today, Portugal has been added to the list of
countries UK travellers can visit without having to quarantine on return. Croatia, Austria and Trinidad and Tobago are being taken off the

in moving forward with clinical trials for a coronavirus vaccine developed by
China National Biotec Group (CNBG), according toReuters,externalnews agency CNBG is seeking research participants from other countries for
testing as cases within Chinaâs own borders dwindle. Phase-three trials, which usually involve several thousand
volunteers, allow researchers to assess how effective potential vaccines are
before final regulatory approvals are granted. The experimental vaccine from CNBG received
approval from the UAE in June for a phase- three trial and has so far recruited
15,000 volunteers. Since then, Peru, Morocco and now Argentina have also approved the

"The number of coronavirus cases in Scotland has risen by 123 in the last 24 hours. The figure represents 1.5% of newly-tested individuals. A total of 19,728 people have now tested positive for Covid-19. No deaths linked to the virus were registered since Friday so the total remains at 2,492. Two people were in intensive care with coronavirus on Friday, and 246 with positive tests were in hospital. Official figures,externalshowed that the biggest increase in cases by health board was 78 in NHS Tayside. The area covers the 2 Sisters food processing plant in Coupar Angus which, by Friday, had beenlinked to 68 positive cases. More than 800 workers at the plant have now been tested for the virus. Workers and those sharing a household with them, including children, have been told they must self-isolate until 31 August. The plant was closed on Monday for two weeks while staff at the site were tested. Nicola Sturgeon said the total increase of 123 positive cases was ""of course a concern"". However, the first minister said the figure ""needs some context"". Ms Sturgeon tweeted: ""78 of them are in Tayside where we're dealing with an outbreak at the 2 Sisters food processing plant. Important that all workers and household contacts follow advice to isolate."" The next biggest 24-hour increase in positive tests by health board was Greater Glasgow and Clyde (+11), followed by Grampian and Lanarkshire (both +8) and Lothian (+6). Figures for the week ending 22 August showed that of the 40,845 people newly tested, 439 cases proved to be positive. Prof Jason Leitch said there were no current plans for a local lockdown n Coupar Angus National clinical director Prof Jason Leitch said the significant rise in new cases was to be expected. He said: ""Today, we have seen the highest number of confirmed cases in a few months with more than 100 positive cases. Around two thirds (78) of the new cases have been recorded in the Tayside area. ""While the figure may be alarming at first glance, this is to be expected as the Test and Protect team continue to work hard to test employees at the 2 Sisters factory and identify their close contacts, following the outbreak at the Coupar Angus site. ""We know that around 90% of the 78 new cases identified in Tayside today are linked to the outbreak at the 2 Sisters factory and we will likely continue to see these numbers rise in the next few days."" Prof Leitch added that it was harder to manage the cases in the NHS Grampian area where sporadic clusters, linked to the night-time economy a few weeks ago, were still appearing and were more dispersed in the community. He said that as the situation in Coupar Angus was more contained, there were no plans for a local lockdown. But he added that everything was being kept under review. Meanwhile, contact tracers are identifying pupils and teachers at a school in Glasgow. NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde confirmed it was working with staff and families linked to John Paul Academy in Summerston. A health board statement said that, at this time, there was ""no evidence of transmission within the school itself"". It added: ""Close contacts are being advised to self-isolate and being given appropriate advice and support. ""Robust control measures are in place within the school. Apart from those who are identified as close contacts, all other pupils and staff can continue to attend as normal."" CASES:Where are the latest cases? DEATHS:Who is dying and where?

"People can now form an ""exclusive extended arrangement"" with up to four households People in Wales are now able to welcome more family and friends into their homes as coronavirus lockdown rules continue to be relaxed. From Saturday, people can form an ""exclusive extended arrangement"" with up to four households - double the previous amount allowed. Some are pleased, but others are wary of opening their doors to others. Sheep farmer Llyr Jones said he was looking forward to seeing his mother and neighbours again. Croatia off safe travel list and France cases spike Why Spain is seeing second wave Is the world winning the pandemic fight? Mr Jones, 41, who lives in Llanfihangel Glyn Myfyr, Conwy county, with his wife and two children, added: ""The worst thing that we have found during the height of the pandemic was childcare. ""My wife's a vet and I'm a farmer, and we are having to take our children to work. ""That brings huge problems but we have to carry on because we are both key workers, but maybe having my mother to come home to look after the children will help."" Llyr Jones is looking forward to being able to welcome his mum and neighbours inside People have been employed on his farm since lockdown began - while they tried to maintain social distancing, it was not always easy.

Prague and Central Bohemia reported the greatest number of cases. Poland and Slovakia also announced their own record figures on Friday, with 903 and 123 cases respectively, while Spain, Italy and France have also seen sharp increases in recent days. Eleven German soldiers have tested positive for coronavirus in Iraq. According to the German army, 10 soldiers were repatriated on Friday. Another man was confirmed to have the virus on Saturday and preparations for his return home are under way.

As we reported earlier, the concerts - called Restart-19 - are being staged as a massive experiment in which scientists will investigate how the virus spreads in mass indoor events. The first concert is being staged as it would have been before the pandemic, the second one with more hygiene measures and social distancing, and the third with half the numbers and people standing 1.5m apart. Everyone taking part is healthy, aged 18 to 50 and has tested negative for coronavirus.

According to theAssociated Press,externalnews agency, food trucks in Seattle have found an alternative way to keep afloat - by driving to the suburbs. People in residential areas are glad of the opportunity not to cook, and treat getting food from the trucks as an excuse to spend some time outdoors with their neighbours, the report says. ""This is festival season, fun season,"" Matt Geller, president of the National Food Truck Association, told AP. ""All the stuff we typically do as humans, we can't do anymore.

When the pandemic was first declared in March, amid closing borders and trade routes, people all over the world tried and failed to get hold of face masks. Now, some countries are facing the opposite problem. According to a report in French newspaperLe Monde,external, companies in France that rushed to produce face coverings at the start of the outbreak are now left with large amounts of unsold stock - even though masks are mandatory in many public places in the country.

Ms McGrady said on Saturday that a large number of ""seasonal"" hourly-paid staff would also lose work. It is not clear how many seasonal staff would be affected but a spokeswoman said the charity would reduce its budget for those workers by a third (Â£8.8m).

The National Trust closed its houses, such as Blickling Hall and Estate, to visitors to help to tackle the spread of coronavirus The National Trust is the UK's largest conservation charity and looks after more than 300 historic houses and almost 800 miles of coastline across England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Ms McGrady said the charity's main aims in the face of its ""financial stress"" were to preserve its houses and outdoor spaces ""to the best of our ability"", and to reduce the impact of cuts to visitors' experiences. The National Trust's 5.6 million members would be able to share their thoughts and have some input before proposals were confirmed, she added.

Filming of the reality TV show The Masked Singer has been suspended in Australia after a number of crew members tested positive for coronavirus. On Saturday, health officials confirmed that seven cases had been linked to the show's production in Melbourne. The programme, which was originally launched in South Korea in 2015 before sparking a number of international versions, features a panel of celebrities who attempt to guess the identity of mystery singers.

This video can not be played How not to wear a face mask The Czech Republic has become the latest European country to announce the highest number of cases since the pandemic began. On Saturday the country recorded 506 new infections - though the health ministry said the increase was due to increased testing, especially among the contacts of people who had tested positive. Prague and Central Bohemia reported the greatest number of cases. Poland and Slovakia also announced their own record figures on Friday, with 903 and 123 cases respectively, while Spain, Italy and France have also seen sharp increases in recent days. Eleven German soldiers have tested positive for coronavirus in Iraq. According to the German army, 10 soldiers were repatriated on Friday. Another man was confirmed to have the virus on Saturday and preparations for his return home are under way. All of the soldiers were in Iraq as part of a non-combat support mission aimed at countering Islamic State. The news comes as the number of infections in Iraq passed 200,000.

No, this isn't an old photo - this is Tim Bendzko performing at a Restart-19 concert today Tim Bendzko, a singer-songwriter who became famous after winning Germany's Bundesvision song contest, is headlining all three coronavirus concerts in the city of Leipzig. As we reported earlier, the concerts - called Restart-19 - are being staged as a massive experiment in which scientists will investigate how the virus spreads in mass indoor events. The first concert is being staged as it would have been before the pandemic, the second one with more hygiene measures and social distancing, and the third with half the numbers and people standing 1.5m apart. Everyone taking part is healthy, aged 18 to 50 and has tested negative for coronavirus. The study by Halle University comes after Germany recorded its highest number of new Covid-19 infections since the end of April. More than 2,000 cases were recorded in the last 24 hours, bringing the total number of infections up to 232,082, the Robert Koch Institute reported. The Slovak football team Slovan Bratislava has gone into quarantine on the Faroe Islands after two of its players tested positive for coronavirus. The governing body for European football, Uefa, said in a statement that the entire team had tested negative before travelling to the remote North Atlantic archipelago. Further testing on arrival showed that one player was infected, leading to their match against Faroese team KÃ KlaksvÃ­k being delayed from 19 to 21 August. Additional players who had also tested negative were put forward to play on the new date - but a member of this second group later tested positive, prompting local officials to place all of Slovan Bratislava's staff and players in quarantine. It is not known where the players contracted the virus. Buta study published by Johns Hopkins University,externalsuggested that testing people too soon after they were infected could lead to a false negative results. Summer is usually a busy time for food trucks in the US, particularly with festivals. But this year, of course, everything's different. According to theAssociated Press,externalnews agency, food trucks in Seattle have found an alternative way to keep afloat - by driving to the suburbs. People in residential areas are glad of the opportunity not to cook, and treat getting food from the trucks as an excuse to spend some time outdoors with their neighbours, the report says. ""This is festival season, fun season,"" Matt Geller, president of the National Food Truck Association, told AP. ""All the stuff we typically do as humans, we can't do anymore. Walking out to a food truck is a taste of normalcy, and it feels really good."" At least 800,000 people have died with coronavirus worldwide, according to the latest tally by Johns Hopkins University in the US. The US has seen the highest number of fatalities, with around 175,000 deaths, followed by Brazil, with 113,000. Almost 23 million infections have also been recorded since the pandemic began.

Ganesh Chaturthi usually involves huge processions, after which idols of Lord Ganesha are submerged in water. But celebrations are low key this year, as large gatherings are prohibited. We reported earlier today that India saw a record increase in infections, pushing the total number of confirmed cases in the country close to three million. Hindus pray to Lord Ganesha for protection - and so, many idols this year depict him crushing the coronavirus, wearing masks and carrying hand sanitiser, such as this one in Ahmedabad This idol in Mumbai also shows Lord Ganesha destroying the coronavirus Priests have also performed pujas - Hindu prayer ceremonies - while wearing masks Worshippers have also adhered to social distancing in temples Job losses and a shift to remote working during lockdown have led many young people to leave London.

The new advice says those aged 12 and over ""should wear a mask under the same conditions as adults, in particular when they cannot guarantee at least a one-metre distance from others and there is widespread transmission in the area"". Younger children could be asked to wear face coverings depending on the situation, the guidance adds, but in general children aged five and under ""should not be required to wear masks"".

A foreign tourist being tested in Zagreb The UK decision to add Croatia to its quarantine list ""not fair"", a Croatian government official has said. Frano Matusic, state secretary at the country's tourism ministry, called on the UK to reverse the move. ""It is true that we have some several hotspots in Croatia but we didnât register until now any infection in hotels, camps and other accommodation facilities,"" he told Sky News. ""So we appeal to UK government to replace this 14-days quarantine measure by reliable tests. We are really disappointed by this."" Read more about Croatia's addition to the list and other questionshere. When the pandemic was first declared in March, amid closing borders and trade routes, people all over the world tried and failed to get hold of face masks. Now, some countries are facing the opposite problem. According to a report in French newspaperLe Monde,external, companies in France that rushed to produce face coverings at the start of the outbreak are now left with large amounts of unsold stock - even though masks are mandatory in many public places in the country. This, the paper says, is because demand has collapsed since May, while trade with manufacturers in China and Vietnam has reopened. ""It is estimated that there are 100 million consumer masks available for sale in the country,"" Yves Dubief, president of the Union des Industries Textiles (Textile Industries Union), told the paper, adding that it ""will take time"" to get through the stocks. People await testing in Mostoles, near Madrid, on Saturday As UK tourists travelling home from Croatia, Austria and Trinidad and Tobago prepare to face two weeks of quarantine, it is interesting to compare numbers of current cases across Europe. As of 22 August,the UK had recorded 21.2 coronavirus cases per 100,000 people over the last fortnight,external, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). In comparison, Croatia had 52.2 cases per 100,000, Austria had 34.6 and France had 54.4. Spain recorded the highest number, at 152.7, although the ECDC says this number includes cases from the previous 14 days. Malta was also high, with 119.5 cases per 100,000. By contrast, Italy's cases were 12.1 per 100,000, and Latvia recorded the lowest number of cases at 2.6. The ECDC urges caution with the data, saying it may not be fully accurate because of the different times that national updates are published. The beaches of the Algarve: Back on the agenda for British holidaymakers As of today, Portugal has been added to the list of

in moving forward with clinical trials for a coronavirus vaccine developed by
China National Biotec Group (CNBG), according toReuters,externalnews agency CNBG is seeking research participants from other countries for
testing as cases within Chinaâs own borders dwindle. Phase-three trials, which usually involve several thousand
volunteers, allow researchers to assess how effective potential vaccines are
before final regulatory approvals are granted. The experimental vaccine from CNBG received
approval from the UAE in June for a phase- three trial and has so far recruited
15,000 volunteers. Since then, Peru, Morocco and now Argentina have also approved the

No, this isn't an old photo - this is Tim Bendzko performing at a Restart-19 concert today Tim Bendzko, a singer-songwriter who became famous after winning Germany's Bundesvision song contest, is headlining all three coronavirus concerts in the city of Leipzig. As we reported earlier, the concerts - called Restart-19 - are being staged as a massive experiment in which scientists will investigate how the virus spreads in mass indoor events. The first concert is being staged as it would have been before the pandemic, the second one with more hygiene measures and social distancing, and the third with half the numbers and people standing 1.5m apart. Everyone taking part is healthy, aged 18 to 50 and has tested negative for coronavirus. The study by Halle University comes after Germany recorded its highest number of new Covid-19 infections since the end of April.

Additional players who had also tested negative were put forward to play on the new date - but a member of this second group later tested positive, prompting local officials to place all of Slovan Bratislava's staff and players in quarantine.

According to theAssociated Press,externalnews agency, food trucks in Seattle have found an alternative way to keep afloat - by driving to the suburbs.

Michael VaughanEx-England captain on BBC Test Match Special For many years I've been criticising the England Test team for underachieveing with the bat. Over the last year, since that first innings at Headingley where they got blown away, I reckon the penny dropped that they can't play Test match cricket like this. The right way to play is to bat a long period of time in the first innings, and I think they're starting to see a bit of the reward of that. They're not the finished article, but I see big scores in this team.

Michael VaughanEx-England captain on BBC Test Match Special England have played the best two days of Test match cricket that I've seen for a long, long time. It's been high-class, attritional, really grinding the opposition into the dirt. The past five or six years, England haven't had that mentality of grinding them into the dirt. This is the first time I have seen it, and that is a great sign. BBC Test Match Special More from Jos Buttler:""Jimmy bowled fantastically well. He's pretty good in those situations. It's going to be tough facing him towards the end of the day. ""Jofra looks fresh, doesn't he? That was exciting to see. ""We need to come out and bowl well. We don't need to force it, and stay patient."" Michael VaughanEx-England captain on BBC Test Match Special We're used to Jos Buttler crashing it around but today he played a pure Test match innings. He was happy to let Crawley play the bigger strokes. I think that's a sign of a batsman maturing at this level. And I liked the fact that he got to a hundred and didn't give it away. I like to see players keep batting and stay in the here and now. BBC Test Match Special England wicketkeeper Jos Buttler:""It was a pleasure to be part of. Zak played an incredibly special knock. We talk as a side about big first-innings runs. To do that and then the wickets tonight, it's a really great day for us. ""I was  very happy to play second fiddle to Zak who was scoring all around the wicket. He made the margin for error very small. It was great to watch. Not many guys hit the ball as cleanly as he does."" Michael VaughanEx-England captain on BBC Test Match Special England have been exceptional over the course of two days. They have played with great control, power at the right times. Jos Buttler played a pure Test match innings. Zak Crawley, speaking to Sky Sports:""It's humbling to be on the list of England's top scorers, I don't see myself anywhere near their calibre, hopefully I can build on this."" Michael VaughanEx-England captain on BBC Test Match Special What a couple of days. Jonathan AgnewBBC cricket correspondent on Test Match Special A terrific session for England, and for Anderson. Pakistan are reeling. They're 559 runs behind England. Pak 24-3 It's not just Babar Azam making his way back, they all are. That's it, close of play for the day. After Zak Crawley's fantastic 267 and Jos Buttler's fine 140, James Anderson does what he does best, picking up three Pakistan wickets. Jonathan AgnewBBC cricket correspondent on Test Match Special There it is! Number 596 for Jimmy Anderson! Babar lbw Anderson 11 (Pak 24-3) A massive wicket at the end of the day! James Anderson is on it and Pakistan's best batsman is making his way back to the dressing room. After a couple that move away, Anderson has one nipping back into the back pad of Babar Azam. Jonathan AgnewBBC cricket correspondent on Test Match Special It's flicked the elbow. A very good decision. Pak 24-2 Replays show it just flicked Azhar's elbow on it's way through to Buttler. The umpire's decision of not out stands. I did hear a noise but it didn't sound woody. Joe Root seemed the most convinced out of the England fielders. Jonathan AgnewBBC cricket correspondent on Test Match Special I didn't hear anything. Jofra said he didn't hear anything at all.

Michael VaughanEx-England captain on BBC Test Match Special For many years I've been criticising the England Test team for underachieveing with the bat. Over the last year, since that first innings at Headingley where they got blown away, I reckon the penny dropped that they can't play Test match cricket like this. The right way to play is to bat a long period of time in the first innings, and I think they're starting to see a bit of the reward of that. They're not the finished article, but I see big scores in this team. BBC Test Match Special England batsman Zak Crawley: ""The Test match in Cape Town was a pretty good feeling but scoring a double hundred for England was beyond my dreams. It's a very good day.""

Michael VaughanEx-England captain on BBC Test Match Special England have played the best two days of Test match cricket that I've seen for a long, long time. It's been high-class, attritional, really grinding the opposition into the dirt. The past five or six years, England haven't had that mentality of grinding them into the dirt. This is the first time I have seen it, and that is a great sign. BBC Test Match Special More from Jos Buttler:""Jimmy bowled fantastically well. He's pretty good in those situations. It's going to be tough facing him towards the end of the day. ""Jofra looks fresh, doesn't he? That was exciting to see. ""We need to come out and bowl well. We don't need to force it, and stay patient."" Michael VaughanEx-England captain on BBC Test Match Special We're used to Jos Buttler crashing it around but today he played a pure Test match innings. He was happy to let Crawley play the bigger strokes. I think that's a sign of a batsman maturing at this level. And I liked the fact that he got to a hundred and didn't give it away. I like to see players keep batting and stay in the here and now. BBC Test Match Special England wicketkeeper Jos Buttler:""It was a pleasure to be part of. Zak played an incredibly special knock. We talk as a side about big first-innings runs. To do that and then the wickets tonight, it's a really great day for us. ""I was  very happy to play second fiddle to Zak who was scoring all around the wicket. He made the margin for error very small. It was great to watch. Not many guys hit the ball as cleanly as he does."" Michael VaughanEx-England captain on BBC Test Match Special England have been exceptional over the course of two days. They have played with great control, power at the right times. Jos Buttler played a pure Test match innings. Zak Crawley, speaking to Sky Sports:""It's humbling to be on the list of England's top scorers, I don't see myself anywhere near their calibre, hopefully I can build on this.""

Pakistan are reeling. They're 559 runs behind England. Pak 24-3 It's not just Babar Azam making his way back, they all are. That's it, close of play for the day.

"Coronavirus will be present ""forever in some form or another"", a member of the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) has said. Sir Mark Walport said people would need to be vaccinated at regular intervals. His comments come after the head of the World Health Organization (WHO)said he hoped the pandemic would be over within two years, as the Spanish flu had taken two years to overcome. Sir Mark said denser populations and travel meant the virus spread easily. He also said the world population was now much larger than in 1918. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Sir Mark said that, in order to control the pandemic, ""global vaccination"" would be required, but coronavirus would not be a disease like smallpox ""which could be eradicated by vaccination"". Where are the world's coronavirus hotspots? UK tourists dash home as quarantine rules kick in ""This is a virus that is going to be with us forever in some form or another, and almost certainly will require repeated vaccinations,"" he said. ""So, a bit like flu, people will need re-vaccination at regular intervals."" Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, head of the WHO, has said that the Spanish flu of 1918 took two years to overcome, and that advances in technology could allow the world to halt coronavirus ""in a shorter time"". The flu of 1918 killed at least 50 million people. Coronavirus has so far killed 800,000 people. Nearly 23 million infections have been recorded but the number of people who have actually had the virus is thought to be much higher due to inadequate testing and asymptomatic cases. SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? JOBS:Can my boss force me to go to work? FACE MASKS:When should you wear one? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? GLOBAL SPREAD:Tracking the pandemic Sir Mark warned that it was ""possible"" coronavirus would get ""out of control"" again, but said more targeted measures could now be used instead of a generic lockdown. Coronavirus cases have been increasing in European countries in recent weeks. Some nations, which had appeared successful in suppressing the initial outbreaks, are now seeing infections rise again. As of 22 August,the UK recorded 21.5 coronavirus cases per 100,000 people over the last fortnight,external, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. Sir Mark said: ""We know that less than one in five people around the country have been infected, so 80% of the population are still susceptible to this virus. ""It is this terrible balance between trying to minimise the harm to people from the infection and protecting people, whilst keeping society going."" He said he was worried about the rise in the number of cases in Europe and other parts of the world. Meanwhile, tourists returning to the UKspent thousands of poundsarranging new flights in a race to get home before new travel rules came into force. From 04:00 BST on Saturday, travellers coming back from Croatia, Austria and Trinidad and Tobago must quarantine for 14 days. There were similar scenes last weekend when new rules kicked in forthose returning from countries including France and the Netherlands.

Phil Harper said he was so proud of PC Harper's brother Sean and sister Aimee for ""being so dignified"" during an ""incredibly tough"" time. PC Harper, 28, suffered catastrophic injuries when he was dragged behind a getaway car in Berkshire last August. His father has backed ""Harper's Law"" launched by his son's widow Lissie. Mrs Harper, 29, has called for killers of emergency workers to face mandatory life sentences, ""no ifs, no buts"". On Friday, the attorney general Suella Braverman QC announced she hadreferred the sentences of PC Harper's killers to the Court of Appeal because she considered them ""unduly lenient"". Lissie Harper has vowed to ""fight for a change in the law in memory of her late husband"" Speaking for the first time since his son's killers were sentenced, Mr Harper said he was ""so proud of Lissie for having the courage to take on this incredible task"". ""I'm also so proud of Sean and Aimee - Andrew's brother and sister - for being so dignified throughout the last year, as it has been so incredibly tough for them too,"" he added. ""Both have lost more than just a brother - he was a best friend as well, who would always take the time to give the best advice he could. My heart was so broken for them when they heard the terrible news."" Mr Harper also paid tribute to his wife Karen for her ""love and support"". The PC's killing that sparked an outpouring of love PC killed in 'truly shocking circumstances' Assaults on Met officers jump 40% during lockdown A trial at the Old Bailey heard how PC Harper had responded to reports of a quad bike theft with a colleague hours after their shift had ended on 15 August 2019. As he attempted to apprehend one of the three suspects, his feet became entangled in a rope trailing behind a getaway car, which led to him being dragged to his death. The driver of the car, 19-year-old Henry Long, and his passengers Albert Bowers and Jessie Cole, both 18, were convicted of manslaughter but cleared of murder. Bowers and Cole havelaunched appeals against their convictions. PC Andrew Harper had been married just four weeks before he was killed Long wasjailed for 16 years while Bowers and Cole were sentenced to 13 years each. Their sentences prompted Mrs Harper and PC Harper's mother Deborah Adlam to launch campaigns calling for tougher sentences for killers of emergency service workers. Mrs Harper, from Wallingford, Oxfordshire,said her campaign, backed by the Police Federation of England and Wales, would ""help fix"" a ""broken"" justice system.

Filming of the reality TV show The Masked Singer has been suspended in Australia after a number of crew members tested positive for coronavirus. On Saturday, health officials confirmed that seven cases had been linked to the show's production in Melbourne. The programme, which was originally launched in South Korea in 2015 before sparking a number of international versions, features a panel of celebrities who attempt to guess the identity of mystery singers. The whole production team for the Australian version - including celebrity judges Danii Minogue and Jackie 'O' - has now been placed in quarantine, the show said in a statement. As face masks are becoming mandatory in an increasing number of settings around the world, you might have noticed that not everyone is clear about how they should be worn. Here's a quick reminder from BBC health correspondent Laura Foster about the dos and donts of face coverings. This video can not be played How not to wear a face mask The Czech Republic has become the latest European country to announce the highest number of cases since the pandemic began. On Saturday the country recorded 506 new infections - though the health ministry said the increase was due to increased testing, especially among the contacts of people who had tested positive. Prague and Central Bohemia reported the greatest number of cases. Poland and Slovakia also announced their own record figures on Friday, with 903 and 123 cases respectively, while Spain, Italy and France have also seen sharp increases in recent days. Eleven German soldiers have tested positive for coronavirus in Iraq. According to the German army, 10 soldiers were repatriated on Friday. Another man was confirmed to have the virus on Saturday and preparations for his return home are under way. All of the soldiers were in Iraq as part of a non-combat support mission aimed at countering Islamic State. The news comes as the number of infections in Iraq passed 200,000. The country has reported around 4,000 new daily cases for more than a week, according to AFP news agency, with fears that numbers could rise due to an upcoming major Shia religious festival. No, this isn't an old photo - this is Tim Bendzko performing at a Restart-19 concert today Tim Bendzko, a singer-songwriter who became famous after winning Germany's Bundesvision song contest, is headlining all three coronavirus concerts in the city of Leipzig. As we reported earlier, the concerts - called Restart-19 - are being staged as a massive experiment in which scientists will investigate how the virus spreads in mass indoor events. The first concert is being staged as it would have been before the pandemic, the second one with more hygiene measures and social distancing, and the third with half the numbers and people standing 1.5m apart. Everyone taking part is healthy, aged 18 to 50 and has tested negative for coronavirus. The study by Halle University comes after Germany recorded its highest number of new Covid-19 infections since the end of April. More than 2,000 cases were recorded in the last 24 hours, bringing the total number of infections up to 232,082, the Robert Koch Institute reported. The Slovak football team Slovan Bratislava has gone into quarantine on the Faroe Islands after two of its players tested positive for coronavirus. The governing body for European football, Uefa, said in a statement that the entire team had tested negative before travelling to the remote North Atlantic archipelago. Further testing on arrival showed that one player was infected, leading to their match against Faroese team KÃ KlaksvÃ­k being delayed from 19 to 21 August. Additional players who had also tested negative were put forward to play on the new date - but a member of this second group later tested positive, prompting local officials to place all of Slovan Bratislava's staff and players in quarantine. It is not known where the players contracted the virus. Buta study published by Johns Hopkins University,externalsuggested that testing people too soon after they were infected could lead to a false negative results. Summer is usually a busy time for food trucks in the US, particularly with festivals. But this year, of course, everything's different. According to theAssociated Press,externalnews agency, food trucks in Seattle have found an alternative way to keep afloat - by driving to the suburbs. People in residential areas are glad of the opportunity not to cook, and treat getting food from the trucks as an excuse to spend some time outdoors with their neighbours, the report says. ""This is festival season, fun season,"" Matt Geller, president of the National Food Truck Association, told AP. ""All the stuff we typically do as humans, we can't do anymore. Walking out to a food truck is a taste of normalcy, and it feels really good."" At least 800,000 people have died with coronavirus worldwide, according to the latest tally by Johns Hopkins University in the US. The US has seen the highest number of fatalities, with around 175,000 deaths, followed by Brazil, with 113,000. Almost 23 million infections have also been recorded since the pandemic began.

Ganesh Chaturthi usually involves huge processions, after which idols of Lord Ganesha are submerged in water. But celebrations are low key this year, as large gatherings are prohibited. We reported earlier today that India saw a record increase in infections, pushing the total number of confirmed cases in the country close to three million. Hindus pray to Lord Ganesha for protection - and so, many idols this year depict him crushing the coronavirus, wearing masks and carrying hand sanitiser, such as this one in Ahmedabad This idol in Mumbai also shows Lord Ganesha destroying the coronavirus Priests have also performed pujas - Hindu prayer ceremonies - while wearing masks Worshippers have also adhered to social distancing in temples Job losses and a shift to remote working during lockdown have led many young people to leave London.

This video can not be played London renting âfeels differentâ after lockdown The World Health Organization has updated its guidance to recommend children aged 12 and above wear face masks. The new advice says those aged 12 and over ""should wear a mask under the same conditions as adults, in particular when they cannot guarantee at least a one-metre distance from others and there is widespread transmission in the area"". Younger children could be asked to wear face coverings depending on the situation, the guidance adds, but in general children aged five and under ""should not be required to wear masks"". The WHO said people should always consult and follow local rules on masks.

A foreign tourist being tested in Zagreb The UK decision to add Croatia to its quarantine list ""not fair"", a Croatian government official has said. Frano Matusic, state secretary at the country's tourism ministry, called on the UK to reverse the move. ""It is true that we have some several hotspots in Croatia but we didnât register until now any infection in hotels, camps and other accommodation facilities,"" he told Sky News. ""So we appeal to UK government to replace this 14-days quarantine measure by reliable tests. We are really disappointed by this."" Read more about Croatia's addition to the list and other questionshere. When the pandemic was first declared in March, amid closing borders and trade routes, people all over the world tried and failed to get hold of face masks. Now, some countries are facing the opposite problem. According to a report in French newspaperLe Monde,external, companies in France that rushed to produce face coverings at the start of the outbreak are now left with large amounts of unsold stock - even though masks are mandatory in many public places in the country. This, the paper says, is because demand has collapsed since May, while trade with manufacturers in China and Vietnam has reopened. ""It is estimated that there are 100 million consumer masks available for sale in the country,"" Yves Dubief, president of the Union des Industries Textiles (Textile Industries Union), told the paper, adding that it ""will take time"" to get through the stocks. People await testing in Mostoles, near Madrid, on Saturday As UK tourists travelling home from Croatia, Austria and Trinidad and Tobago prepare to face two weeks of quarantine, it is interesting to compare numbers of current cases across Europe. As of 22 August,the UK had recorded 21.2 coronavirus cases per 100,000 people over the last fortnight,external, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). In comparison, Croatia had 52.2 cases per 100,000, Austria had 34.6 and France had 54.4. Spain recorded the highest number, at 152.7, although the ECDC says this number includes cases from the previous 14 days. Malta was also high, with 119.5 cases per 100,000. By contrast, Italy's cases were 12.1 per 100,000, and Latvia recorded the lowest number of cases at 2.6. The ECDC urges caution with the data, saying it may not be fully accurate because of the different times that national updates are published.

"Idles performing at the Liverpool Olympia, which is among the venues to have received funding Small music venues in England have welcomed the announcement of a further Â£1.1m emergency government funding. Many venues, which have been closed since mid-March due to Covid-19, are facing the threat of closure. Last month, Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden rolled out his plan for a Â£1.57bn Culture Recovery Fund, including Â£2.25m for music venues. That has now increased to Â£3.36m due to high demand. The fund will be split between 135 grassroots venues. Arts industry welcomes Â£1.57bn support package Emergency money for culture 'won't save every job' Recipients include The Troubadour in London, where Adele and Ed Sheeran performed early on; and The Jacaranda in Liverpool, where The Beatles played early gigs. The grants range from Â£1,000 to Â£80,000, with the average working out at Â£25,000 per venue. ""We warmly welcome this first distribution from the Culture Recovery Fund which will ensure that the short-term future of these venues is secured while we continue to work on how we can ensure their long-term sustainability,"" said Mark Davyd of the Music Venue Trust. He said the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport together with Arts Council England had ""worked very quickly to fully understand the imminent risk of permanent closure faced by a significant number of grassroots music venues across the country"". The funding ""creates a real breathing space for under pressure venues"", he added. The Amersham Arms, London - Â£80,000 Chalk, Brighton - Â£80,000 The Clapham Grand, London - Â£80,000 The Troubadour, London - Â£80,000 Camp and Furnace, Liverpool - Â£79,604 The Dublin Castle, London - Â£78,583 Liverpool Olympia - Â£73,900 The money is intended to cover ongoing running costs including rent and utility bills. Indoor performances can now restart with socially distanced audiences, so some music venues are able to reopen. The future remains uncertain for many, however, especially with the furlough scheme coming to an end in November. Mr Dowden, said: ""I encourage music fans to help too by supporting music and cultural events as they start to get going again. We need a collective effort to help the things we love through Covid.""

"Lori Loughlin and her husband Mossimo Giannulli, right, admitted being part of the scheme US actress Lori Loughlin, star of the sitcom Full House, has been sentenced to two months in prison for her part in a US college admissions scam. A federal judge accepted a plea deal before sentencing the star. Her husband, Mossimo Giannulli, was handed a five-month prison term. In May, the couple admitted to taking part in a fraud scheme designed to ensure spots for their daughters at the University of Southern California as fake athletic recruits. The plea deal requires Loughlin to pay a $150,000 (Â£112,000) fine and complete 100 hours of community service. Fashion designer Giannulli must pay a $250,000 fine and complete 250 hours of community service. ""I made an awful decision,"" Loughlin said via video link. ""I went along with a plan to give my daughters an unfair advantage in the college admissions process, and in doing so, I ignored my intuition and allowed myself to be swayed from my moral compass."" Lori Loughlin and her two daughters Olivia Jade Gianulli (L), and Isabella Gianulli (R) The pair are among 50 people charged in an alleged criminal enterprise to get their children into top US universities. In May, Loughlin pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit wire and mail fraud in a court in Massachusetts. Giannulli pleaded guilty to the same charges, plus a further count of honest services wire and mail fraud. The couple had initially pleaded not guilty to the fraud charges. Prosecutors said Loughlin and Giannulli paid $500,000 (Â£408,000) in bribes to have their two daughters admitted into the University of Southern California (USC) as fake rowing-team recruits. The couple are among the most high-profile suspects to be caught up in the national cheating scandal. Desperate Housewives actress Felicity Huffman was also charged and pleaded guilty within one month. She ultimately served 11 days of a two-week sentence in a San Francisco-area prison. Prosecutors in Massachusetts had publicly warned Loughlin that the longer her case dragged on, the longer her sentence would be if she was eventually convicted at trial rather than entering a guilty plea.

"The National Trust, which has 5.6 million members, looks after properties around the country The National Trust's director general has denied the charity will ""dumb down"" after a leaked document suggested many top experts could lose their jobs as a result of coronavirus. The heritage charityis facing Â£200m of lossesafter closing its shops, cafes, houses and gardens during the pandemic. Hilary McGrady said the charity was finding ""creative ways"" to save money. But she added: ""We simply can't afford to keep doing everything the way we were before."" An internal briefing document,leaked by the Times,externalnewspaper, outlines plans for the charity to ""dial down"" its role as a major cultural institution - including holding fewer exhibitions and putting collections into storage in favour of becoming a ""gateway to the outdoors"". National Trust plans 1,200 job cuts National Trust 'faces Â£200m losses this year' Covid funding boost saves 200 National Trust jobs Ms McGrady toldBBC Radio 4's Today programmeshe could ""understand why"" documents had been leaked, because people were ""very anxious"" about their jobs. Some1,200 National Trust staff were told they faced redundancy- about 13% of the 9,500-strong salaried workforce - last month. Ms McGrady said on Saturday that a large number of ""seasonal"" hourly-paid staff would also lose work. It is not clear how many seasonal staff would be affected but a spokeswoman said the charity would reduce its budget for those workers by a third (Â£8.8m). Ms McGrady said she was ""hugely sad"" at having to propose losing any staff but that the charity had been hit ""extraordinarily badly by Covid-19"". SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? HOLIDAYS:Will I get a summer break? FACE MASKS:When should you wear one? TESTING:Who can get a test and how? She dismissed a suggestion the trust would be ""dumbed down"" as a result of arts specialists losing their jobs. More jobs would be cut in areas such as the charity's marketing and catering sectors in order to maintain roles in houses and gardens, she said - with 80 of 111 people with ""curator"" in their job title expected to stay in position. But Ms McGrady added: ""I cannot pretend that we're going to keep them all because we simply can't afford to keep doing everything the way we were before."" ""This is a really serious thing that we are going through at the moment."" The National Trust closed its houses, such as Blickling Hall and Estate, to visitors to help to tackle the spread of coronavirus The National Trust is the UK's largest conservation charity and looks after more than 300 historic houses and almost 800 miles of coastline across England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Ms McGrady said the charity's main aims in the face of its ""financial stress"" were to preserve its houses and outdoor spaces ""to the best of our ability"", and to reduce the impact of cuts to visitors' experiences. The National Trust's 5.6 million members would be able to share their thoughts and have some input before proposals were confirmed, she added.

"People can now form an ""exclusive extended arrangement"" with up to four households People in Wales are now able to welcome more family and friends into their homes as coronavirus lockdown rules continue to be relaxed. From Saturday, people can form an ""exclusive extended arrangement"" with up to four households - double the previous amount allowed. Some are pleased, but others are wary of opening their doors to others. Sheep farmer Llyr Jones said he was looking forward to seeing his mother and neighbours again. Croatia off safe travel list and France cases spike Why Spain is seeing second wave Is the world winning the pandemic fight? Mr Jones, 41, who lives in Llanfihangel Glyn Myfyr, Conwy county, with his wife and two children, added: ""The worst thing that we have found during the height of the pandemic was childcare. ""My wife's a vet and I'm a farmer, and we are having to take our children to work. ""That brings huge problems but we have to carry on because we are both key workers, but maybe having my mother to come home to look after the children will help."" Llyr Jones is looking forward to being able to welcome his mum and neighbours inside People have been employed on his farm since lockdown began - while they tried to maintain social distancing, it was not always easy. ""It's impossible to keep to two-metre distances,"" he said. ""We have two young children who are in nursery, so they are mixing, they are not social distancing."" Lee Dirkzwager remains unsure about opening the doors of her home to others Lee Dirkzwager, from Gabalfa, Cardiff, has been shielding. The 73-year-old has a number of underlying conditions, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The mother-of-three and grandmother-of-three went out on Sunday but was ""quite nervous"" about doing so. ""I didn't enjoy it and came back to what I now call the norm, which is isolation,"" she said. ""I think it is going to take a long time to adjust to get back into the flow of pre-March this year. ""And, being honest, I am worried about opening up and having to meet even family."" Outdoor sports and arts events to be trialled The retired office worker admitted she would ""love"" to see them, but feared the pandemic would return. ""Are we going to be ill next time around?"" she said. She did not enjoy her trip out because there were ""so many people"", many unmasked. ""It was totally alien,"" she said. ""I suppose I've become institutionalised being on my own."" The rules on meeting people indoorswere expected to be relaxed last weekend but were postponed. Events co-ordinator Amy Nation, said there was an ""exciting day"" ahead at The Bear Hotel in Cowbridge, Vale of Glamorgan, where a wedding was due to be held. She said there had been big changes to comply with social distancing rules, so seating has been spaced out. But she said the main difference would be that a large evening party ""can't currently go head"". Ameal following a wedding and civil partnership is allowed,externalfor up to 30 people indoors if social distancing can be maintained. ""We have had to adapt,"" she toldBBC Radio Wales Breakfast. But Deeside wedding photographer Rich Miller said the industry had been hit hard by cancellations due to the pandemic and he was not yet sure if more weddings would go ahead later in the year. ""Nobody know what way to turn,"" he said. ""We are all holding on towards the end of the year."" On Friday, First Minister Mark Drakeford said trials of outdoor sports and arts events would be allowed later this month First Minister Mark Drakeford said at the time it was important not to jeopardise progress. Mr Drakeford said the next easing of lockdown measures, in three weeks' time, would include relaxing rules to allow cleaners and tutors to work in people's homes. It would also allow small groups to meet indoors for classes and clubs, such as book clubs and weight loss groups.

PC Harper, 28, suffered catastrophic injuries when he was dragged behind a getaway car in Berkshire last August. His father has backed ""Harper's Law"" launched by his son's widow Lissie. Mrs Harper, 29, has called for killers of emergency workers to face mandatory life sentences, ""no ifs, no buts"". On Friday, the attorney general Suella Braverman QC announced she hadreferred the sentences of PC Harper's killers to the Court of Appeal because she considered them ""unduly lenient"". Lissie Harper has vowed to ""fight for a change in the law in memory of her late husband"" Speaking for the first time since his son's killers were sentenced, Mr Harper said he was ""so proud of Lissie for having the courage to take on this incredible task"". ""I'm also so proud of Sean and Aimee - Andrew's brother and sister - for being so dignified throughout the last year, as it has been so incredibly tough for them too,"" he added. ""Both have lost more than just a brother - he was a best friend as well, who would always take the time to give the best advice he could.

"NHS Wales' staff sickness in the early stages of the coronavirus pandemic was the highest on record. The sickness rate in the three months to March was 6% - up 0.4% on the same time in 2019 -the highest since data began being collected in 2008,external. Those self-isolating were not counted in the figures, which cover the period just before April's coronavirus peak. The Welsh Government said it took NHS staff wellbeing ""extremely seriously"" and offered help to reduce sick rates. In a report, it said March saw the highest-recorded monthly rate, adding that given the timing it was ""more than likely attributed to Covid-19"". Despite being only one of two areas of the NHS to show a decrease in sickness, the Welsh Ambulance Services NHS Trust still had the highest rate - 7.1% compared to the Wales average of 6%. The absence rate is calculated by taking the number of sick days and dividing it by the total number of days available for each area of the NHS. Remembering 100 NHS and healthcare workers who died Ambulance staff 'feel unprotected' How many coronavirus cases are there in your area? Healthcare assistants and support workers had the highest absence rate in any one staff group at 8%, followed by ambulance workers (7.5%) and nurses, midwives and health visitors (7.2%). Sickness rates have never fallen below 5% for this quarter in the past decade and climbed in recent years from 5.1% in 2016 to 5.6% in 2019. 'We feel guilty being off' Alison Magor has been a district nurse for 15 years Alison Magor, 56, is a district nursing sister who manages a team in Cwmbran. She caught coronavirus in March and was off work for the best part of five weeks. ""It's quite frightening having Covid,"" she said. ""We all think that we know what it's like to have flu and to have viruses, but to be so very, very short of breath and to be so fatigued, to be so tired [and] not want to eat, not want to drink."" Ms Magor said the health board and her colleagues had done everything possible to ensure ""stringent"" safeguards had been in place at the time she caught the virus, and praised them for their support. But being away from work made her feel bad about not being able to help. ""All you do is think about your team. How are they doing? How are they coping? ""We all feel guilty in the NHS if we're off, because that's one man down. That's another person who's not there to help carry the load. It is it what it is - you know you can't help it."" Ms Magor said she currently has a member of staff off waiting for the result of a Covid-19 test and she was emailing in every day, anxious about being absent. ""I said 'don't worry about it, you'll know when you get the test back. Just look after yourself',"" she added. ""I'm very proud of my team because the minute that everybody is well enough to come back in, they've been back in work."" Nicky Hughes said the pandemic had affected NHS workers' mental health after some became patients themselves Nicky Hughes, of the Royal College of Nursing (RCN), said she expected to see the sickness rate get worse when the figures for the next quarter are released - which will include the peak of the virus in April. She said: ""I would imagine we would see a spike in those weeks before testing came in and we had huge circulation in the community."" Ms Hughes, the RCN's associate director of nursing for employment relations, said the one change that would have made the biggest difference to managing staff sickness would have been an earlier rollout of testing of NHS staff. Wales' health minister announcedfront-line NHS staff would be screened from 18 March. ""We called for testing to be brought in at an earlier stage, we had staff who had symptoms - it could have been coronavirus, it could have been a common cold,"" said Ms Hughes. ""We had members saying: 'If I could have a test, I could get back to my workplace.' ""If we had testing sooner, we may have been able to help get people back to work quicker."" While the ambulance service had the highest sickness absence rate of any trust (7.1%), this fell by 0.4% for the equivalent period in 2019. Helen Watkins, the Welsh Ambulance Service's deputy director of workforce and organisational development, said: ""The very nature of ambulance work means that the wellbeing of our staff is pushed to the limit, physically and emotionally. ""Our sickness absence figures are not where we want them to be, but we're one of two organisations across NHS Wales that have actually improved compared to the same period last year, and are encouraged that they're moving in the right direction."" The union Unison said health services would need to wait until later in the year for a ""much clearer picture of the impact of Covid on the NHS Wales"". Regional secretary Tanya Palmer added: ""Looking after very sick patients during the Covid public health emergency placed an unimaginable mental and physical toll on Welsh healthcare workers and their social care colleagues. ""Many became ill and devastatingly, some paid with their lives helping others. ""The challenge was unprecedented in their careers. Dealing with the scale of death when patients' families could not be present is likely to leave a lasting impact and we know many will suffer post-traumatic stress disorder. ""There is a duty on their employer and government to provide these workers with every support they need."" A Welsh Government spokesman said: ""We take NHS staff health and wellbeing extremely seriously and support NHS Wales to reduce sickness rates. ""This includes the Corporate Health Standard for staff and providing a range of extra support during the pandemic, including over Â£1m for mental health support. ""We expect some variance from year to year in sickness levels. We prioritised NHS staff testing as soon as the tests became available and moved quickly to increase testing capacity.""

"A series of massive fires in northern and central California forced more evacuations California is struggling to contain huge wildfires burning forests and homes, warned Governor Gavin Newsom on Friday as more than 12,000 fire-fighters battled blazes that have killed six people. Help was on its way from several US states as Gov Newsom put in a plea for assistance from Australia and Canada. ""These fires are stretching our resources, our personnel,"" he said. Among the 560 fires are some of the largest the state has seen. More than 12,000 dry lightning strikes started the blazes during a historic heat wave in which thermometers in Death Valley National Park reachedwhat could be the highest ever temperature reliably recorded. By Friday, emergency officials said some of the fires had doubled in size in a day, forcing 175,000 residents to flee. Two fires are now the 7th and 10th largest in the state's history, Gov Newsom said as he urged President Donald Trump to sign a major disaster declaration. The CZU Lightning Complex fire destroyed homes in Davenport, California The worst are in the mountains to the south and east of San Francisco. At least 43 people including firefighters have been injured, and hundreds of buildings have burned down and thousands more are threatened. Many blazes are burning on steep, difficult-to-access terrain and have been fuelled by strong winds. The fires are also threatening larger towns including Santa Cruz where flames reached within a mile of the University of California Santa Cruz campus, reports Reuters news agency. More fire=fighters, engines and surveillance planes are racing in from other states including Oregon, New Mexico and Texas to help. Assistance from what Gov Newsom called ""the world's best wildfire-fighters"" in Australia has been requested. ""We simply haven't seen anything like this in many, many years,"" he said, adding that an area the size of the US state of Rhode Island had already burned within California. Redwoods, the tallest trees in the world, have caught fire near their eponymous state park With more than 650,000 coronavirus cases, California also has the highest number of infections in the US, and some evacuees have said they are afraid to go to emergency shelters. One woman told CNN she had been forced to flee to a community centre in Vacaville but was refusing to go inside for fear of catching coronavirus. ""Not only are we dealing with Covid, but with also the heat and now the fires,"" said Cheryl Jarvis, who said she was currently sleeping in her Toyota Prius. US agencies have updated disaster preparedness and evacuation guidance in light of Covid-19. People who may be required to flee have been to told to carry at least two face masks per person, as well as hand sanitiser, soap and disinfectant wipes. Here are some key guidelines for protecting yourself against Covid-19 if you must evacuate to a shelter: Wash your hands often Keep six feet of distance from anyone not among your household Wear a face covering when possible, and if possible, wash it regularly Avoid sharing food and drinks Frequently disinfect your area in the shelter (including toys and electronics) Emergency shelters are enforcing social distancing rules and mask wearing, and have even given individual tents to families to self-isolate. Some counties are seeking to set up separate shelters for sick evacuees or anyone who is found to have a high temperature. Officials say people should consider sheltering with family and friends. In another pandemic twist, officials also advise that people remain indoors due to the poor air quality outside. California is also facing an electricity strain, which has caused a rolling blackout for thousands of customers. Officials have appealed for residents to use less power or risk further cuts. In total, more than 1,205 square miles (3,121 sq km) have burned across the state. A mother and daughter in an evacuation centre in Vacaville Satellite images show smoke blanketing nearly all of California, as well most of Nevada and southern Idaho. Big Basin Redwoods State Park, California's oldest state park and home to redwood trees that are 2,000 years old, sustained extensive damage to historic buildings. Firefighting teams are stretched thin across the state and have been forced to work longer shifts than usual. A volunteer firefighting corps made up of state prisoners, which has helped the state battle blazes since World War Two, has been diminished this year due to the pandemic. Fires have burned through parts of California's wine-producing regions President Trump blamed California for the fires, and threatened to withhold federal funding ashe repeated a suggestion that was met with bemusement when he first raised it in 2018. Speaking to supporters in Pennsylvania on Thursday, he said he had told state officials: ""You gotta clean your floors, you gotta clean your forests â there are many, many years of leaves and broken trees and they're like, like, so flammable, you touch them and it goes up."" ""I've been telling them this now for three years, but they don't want to listen,"" he said. ""'The environment, the environment,' but they have massive fires again.""

"Oldham, along with other parts of northern England, has extra restrictions in place Stricter new measures designed to stop the spread of coronavirus in the North West have been branded ""confusing"". Residents in Oldham and parts of Blackburn and Pendle have been told not to socialise with other households. Local council leaders said it was ""unclear"" how the rule would be implemented and policed and urged the government to issue detailed guidance. Workplaces, childcare facilities and businesses, including pubs and restaurants, will remain open. Under the new rules, introduced on Saturday, residents are advised to only use public transport for essential travel. Restaurants are advised to only cater for pre-booked customers, with a maximum of six people per table. Residents can also attend the weddings, civil partnerships and funerals of members of their household and close family, with ceremonies limited to 20 people Schools are still set to open from 1 September. The new ban on socialising will apply to the following areas of Blackburn with Darwen: Audley & Queen's Park, Bastwell & Daisyfield, Billinge & Beardwood, Blackburn Central, Little Harwood & Whitebirk, Roe Lee, Shear Brow & Corporation Park, Wensley Fold. Areas in Blackburn with Darwen where extra restrictions have been lifted are: Blackburn South & Lower Darwen, Blackburn South East, Darwen East, Darwen South, Darwen West, Ewood, Livesey with Pleasington, Mill Hill & Moorgate, West Pennine Restrictions in Pendle remain but the new socialising ban applies to the following areas: Whitefield, Walverden, Southfield, Bradley, Clover Hill, Brierfield, Marsden The new guidelines were leaked to a local newspaper before the government's official confirmation on Friday afternoon. Sean Fielding, leader of Oldham Council, said it was looking to provide clarity to residents ""because the announcement itself from the government wasn't the smoothest"". Mohammed Iqbal, leader of Pendle Council, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""The government has announced these tightening restrictions for local people in my area, yet they have not issued any detailed guidance as to how it will operate, who will police it. ""So local people are actually more confused than they were on Thursday evening."" Shoppers, pictured here in Manchester, are seen as part of the economic recovery On Saturday,Greater Manchester Police issued a social media post,externalurging people not to call 999 or 101 for clarification about the measures. However,the force were criticised on social media,externalafter they issued a fixed penalty notice to a homeowner who had hosted a child's birthday party in a garden, attended by three families. A police spokesman said: ""This was one of several breaches of Covid-19 regulations that were publicised to demonstrate the breadth of incidents GMP have been called to in just one night."" Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham said police were ""in a no-win situation because sometimes they get criticised for not doing enough and then when they do enforce the measures they get criticism back"". Since July, the government has been introducing extra restrictions in parts of northern England after a spike in coronavirus cases. The tighter rules will be removed in Wigan, Darwen and Rossendale on Wednesday after they recorded lower infection rates than other areas. Residents in those towns will be required to follow national guidance, including social distancing and wearing a face covering where appropriate. However, the extra restrictions will remain for the rest of Greater Manchester and East Lancashire, plus Preston, where gatherings ofseparate households are banned in most circumstances,external. How many confirmed cases are there in your area? A government spokesman said the ""sharp rise"" in confirmed cases was partly due to a major increase in testing led by local councils. He added the spike ""continues to be due to social mixing between younger age groups of 20-39 year olds"". Dr Sakthi Karunanithi, public health director at Lancashire County Council, said: ""The vast majority - more than 80% - of coronavirus transmission (in the affected parts of Pendle and Blackburn) is as a result of households mixing. ""That's why we are putting out a very clear message - do not socialise with people you don't live with."" The new rules came into force in Oldham, and parts of Pendle and Blackburn on Saturday Mohammed Khan, leader of Blackburn with Darwen Council, said the borough, which launched a local contact-tracing service earlier in August, would continue ""our important work fighting this infection at a really local level"". ""We know that our residents have been making huge sacrifices and that businesses are struggling. ""We desperately needed to prevent the threat of a full, borough-wide lockdown as this would have been devastating."" Mr Burnham said: ""We have been able to keep businesses open in Oldham and that's a significant victory for the council because they were worried about the fragility of the economy. ""So what we have got instead are more targeted measuresâ¦ which are much better than going into a lockdown situation where businesses have to close."" Mr Burnham said there had been ""a noticeable fall in cases this week"" in Oldham and other parts of Greater Manchester. ""Fingers crossed, we can see more boroughs released from these measures soon."" Pakistan cricket captain Azhar Ali is among celebrities who will promote the new guidelines Mr Fielding said Oldham Council had closed at least one pub since Friday for flouting the rules. He said the council had also enlisted celebrities such as Pakistan cricket captain Azhar Ali, who is currently playing  in a Test Match series against England, and The Inbetweeners actor James Buckley ""to get the message out to communities that might listen to [them] rather than listen to me."" ""We are also doing some really targeted intervention in our most affected communities, and that includes things like door-to-door testing, using community leaders to get messages over."" Earlier this week, the council shared a clip of Game Of Thrones actor James Cosmo warning residents that ""lockdown is coming"" unless they abide by guidelines. Elsewhere,Birmingham has been added to the government's watch list,and Northampton named an ""area of intervention"".

Filming of the reality TV show The Masked Singer has been suspended in Australia after a number of crew members tested positive for coronavirus. On Saturday, health officials confirmed that seven cases had been linked to the show's production in Melbourne. The programme, which was originally launched in South Korea in 2015 before sparking a number of international versions, features a panel of celebrities who attempt to guess the identity of mystery singers. The whole production team for the Australian version - including celebrity judges Danii Minogue and Jackie 'O' - has now been placed in quarantine, the show said in a statement. As face masks are becoming mandatory in an increasing number of settings around the world, you might have noticed that not everyone is clear about how they should be worn. Here's a quick reminder from BBC health correspondent Laura Foster about the dos and donts of face coverings. This video can not be played How not to wear a face mask The Czech Republic has become the latest European country to announce the highest number of cases since the pandemic began. On Saturday the country recorded 506 new infections - though the health ministry said the increase was due to increased testing, especially among the contacts of people who had tested positive. Prague and Central Bohemia reported the greatest number of cases. Poland and Slovakia also announced their own record figures on Friday, with 903 and 123 cases respectively, while Spain, Italy and France have also seen sharp increases in recent days. Eleven German soldiers have tested positive for coronavirus in Iraq. According to the German army, 10 soldiers were repatriated on Friday. Another man was confirmed to have the virus on Saturday and preparations for his return home are under way. All of the soldiers were in Iraq as part of a non-combat support mission aimed at countering Islamic State. The news comes as the number of infections in Iraq passed 200,000. The country has reported around 4,000 new daily cases for more than a week, according to AFP news agency, with fears that numbers could rise due to an upcoming major Shia religious festival. No, this isn't an old photo - this is Tim Bendzko performing at a Restart-19 concert today Tim Bendzko, a singer-songwriter who became famous after winning Germany's Bundesvision song contest, is headlining all three coronavirus concerts in the city of Leipzig. As we reported earlier, the concerts - called Restart-19 - are being staged as a massive experiment in which scientists will investigate how the virus spreads in mass indoor events. The first concert is being staged as it would have been before the pandemic, the second one with more hygiene measures and social distancing, and the third with half the numbers and people standing 1.5m apart. Everyone taking part is healthy, aged 18 to 50 and has tested negative for coronavirus. The study by Halle University comes after Germany recorded its highest number of new Covid-19 infections since the end of April. More than 2,000 cases were recorded in the last 24 hours, bringing the total number of infections up to 232,082, the Robert Koch Institute reported. The Slovak football team Slovan Bratislava has gone into quarantine on the Faroe Islands after two of its players tested positive for coronavirus. The governing body for European football, Uefa, said in a statement that the entire team had tested negative before travelling to the remote North Atlantic archipelago. Further testing on arrival showed that one player was infected, leading to their match against Faroese team KÃ KlaksvÃ­k being delayed from 19 to 21 August. Additional players who had also tested negative were put forward to play on the new date - but a member of this second group later tested positive, prompting local officials to place all of Slovan Bratislava's staff and players in quarantine. It is not known where the players contracted the virus. Buta study published by Johns Hopkins University,externalsuggested that testing people too soon after they were infected could lead to a false negative results. Summer is usually a busy time for food trucks in the US, particularly with festivals. But this year, of course, everything's different. According to theAssociated Press,externalnews agency, food trucks in Seattle have found an alternative way to keep afloat - by driving to the suburbs. People in residential areas are glad of the opportunity not to cook, and treat getting food from the trucks as an excuse to spend some time outdoors with their neighbours, the report says. ""This is festival season, fun season,"" Matt Geller, president of the National Food Truck Association, told AP. ""All the stuff we typically do as humans, we can't do anymore. Walking out to a food truck is a taste of normalcy, and it feels really good."" At least 800,000 people have died with coronavirus worldwide, according to the latest tally by Johns Hopkins University in the US. The US has seen the highest number of fatalities, with around 175,000 deaths, followed by Brazil, with 113,000. Almost 23 million infections have also been recorded since the pandemic began.

Ganesh Chaturthi usually involves huge processions, after which idols of Lord Ganesha are submerged in water. But celebrations are low key this year, as large gatherings are prohibited. We reported earlier today that India saw a record increase in infections, pushing the total number of confirmed cases in the country close to three million. Hindus pray to Lord Ganesha for protection - and so, many idols this year depict him crushing the coronavirus, wearing masks and carrying hand sanitiser, such as this one in Ahmedabad This idol in Mumbai also shows Lord Ganesha destroying the coronavirus Priests have also performed pujas - Hindu prayer ceremonies - while wearing masks Worshippers have also adhered to social distancing in temples Job losses and a shift to remote working during lockdown have led many young people to leave London.

This video can not be played London renting âfeels differentâ after lockdown The World Health Organization has updated its guidance to recommend children aged 12 and above wear face masks. The new advice says those aged 12 and over ""should wear a mask under the same conditions as adults, in particular when they cannot guarantee at least a one-metre distance from others and there is widespread transmission in the area"". Younger children could be asked to wear face coverings depending on the situation, the guidance adds, but in general children aged five and under ""should not be required to wear masks"". The WHO said people should always consult and follow local rules on masks.

A foreign tourist being tested in Zagreb The UK decision to add Croatia to its quarantine list ""not fair"", a Croatian government official has said. Frano Matusic, state secretary at the country's tourism ministry, called on the UK to reverse the move. ""It is true that we have some several hotspots in Croatia but we didnât register until now any infection in hotels, camps and other accommodation facilities,"" he told Sky News. ""So we appeal to UK government to replace this 14-days quarantine measure by reliable tests. We are really disappointed by this."" Read more about Croatia's addition to the list and other questionshere. When the pandemic was first declared in March, amid closing borders and trade routes, people all over the world tried and failed to get hold of face masks. Now, some countries are facing the opposite problem. According to a report in French newspaperLe Monde,external, companies in France that rushed to produce face coverings at the start of the outbreak are now left with large amounts of unsold stock - even though masks are mandatory in many public places in the country. This, the paper says, is because demand has collapsed since May, while trade with manufacturers in China and Vietnam has reopened. ""It is estimated that there are 100 million consumer masks available for sale in the country,"" Yves Dubief, president of the Union des Industries Textiles (Textile Industries Union), told the paper, adding that it ""will take time"" to get through the stocks. People await testing in Mostoles, near Madrid, on Saturday As UK tourists travelling home from Croatia, Austria and Trinidad and Tobago prepare to face two weeks of quarantine, it is interesting to compare numbers of current cases across Europe. As of 22 August,the UK had recorded 21.2 coronavirus cases per 100,000 people over the last fortnight,external, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). In comparison, Croatia had 52.2 cases per 100,000, Austria had 34.6 and France had 54.4. Spain recorded the highest number, at 152.7, although the ECDC says this number includes cases from the previous 14 days. Malta was also high, with 119.5 cases per 100,000. By contrast, Italy's cases were 12.1 per 100,000, and Latvia recorded the lowest number of cases at 2.6. The ECDC urges caution with the data, saying it may not be fully accurate because of the different times that national updates are published.

"Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus outbreak this Saturday morning. Travellers returning to the UK from Croatia, Austria and Trinidad and Tobago must now quarantine for 14 days.Some UK tourists raced to beat Saturday's 04:00 quarantine deadline, enduring long drives and spending thousands of pounds on new flights.Meanwhile, searches for flights to Portugal surged after the country was added to the UK's safe travel list. STA travel has become the latest business to cease trading, as the coronavirus pandemic continues to impact the travel sector.Almost 500 UK jobs are thought to be at risk at the company, which specialises in trips for young people, such as gap years. The firm, which has more than 50 UK shops, said its sales had not picked up as anticipated due to renewed lockdown measures and customer uncertainty. When the lockdown began in March, employees across the UK packed up their office gear and began working from home. For some, it was a welcome break from the daily commute.But after six months, others are struggling to cope. Tara Hudson, a council worker, said the lack of space and proper equipment in the one-bedroom flat she shares with her husband, makes working from home unbearable. Tara Hudson says her back is now ""in absolute agony"" Would-be volunteers are campaigning to be allowed to participate in so-called ""challenge trials"" to try to speed up the development of a coronavirus vaccine. The trials would involve volunteers being given a Covid vaccine, followed by a dose of live coronavirus a few weeks later, to test whether the jab has protected them.Alastair Fraser-Urquhart, 18, is one such volunteer who has spoken to the BBC. Many of England's small music venues shuttered their doors in mid-March due to Covid-19, and now face the threat of permanent closure.

Croatia off safe travel list and France cases spike Why Spain is seeing second wave Is the world winning the pandemic fight? Mr Jones, 41, who lives in Llanfihangel Glyn Myfyr, Conwy county, with his wife and two children, added: ""The worst thing that we have found during the height of the pandemic was childcare. ""My wife's a vet and I'm a farmer, and we are having to take our children to work. ""That brings huge problems but we have to carry on because we are both key workers, but maybe having my mother to come home to look after the children will help.""

Outdoor sports and arts events to be trialled The retired office worker admitted she would ""love"" to see them, but feared the pandemic would return. ""Are we going to be ill next time around?"" she said. She did not enjoy her trip out because there were ""so many people"", many unmasked. ""It was totally alien,"" she said.

"People can now form an ""exclusive extended arrangement"" with up to four households People in Wales are now able to welcome more family and friends into their homes as coronavirus lockdown rules continue to be relaxed. From Saturday, people can form an ""exclusive extended arrangement"" with up to four households - double the previous amount allowed. Some are pleased, but others are wary of opening their doors to others. Sheep farmer Llyr Jones said he was looking forward to seeing his mother and neighbours again. Croatia off safe travel list and France cases spike Why Spain is seeing second wave Is the world winning the pandemic fight? Mr Jones, 41, who lives in Llanfihangel Glyn Myfyr, Conwy county, with his wife and two children, added: ""The worst thing that we have found during the height of the pandemic was childcare. ""My wife's a vet and I'm a farmer, and we are having to take our children to work. ""That brings huge problems but we have to carry on because we are both key workers, but maybe having my mother to come home to look after the children will help."" Llyr Jones is looking forward to being able to welcome his mum and neighbours inside People have been employed on his farm since lockdown began - while they tried to maintain social distancing, it was not always easy. ""It's impossible to keep to two-metre distances,"" he said. ""We have two young children who are in nursery, so they are mixing, they are not social distancing."" Lee Dirkzwager remains unsure about opening the doors of her home to others Lee Dirkzwager, from Gabalfa, Cardiff, has been shielding. The 73-year-old has a number of underlying conditions, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The mother-of-three and grandmother-of-three went out on Sunday but was ""quite nervous"" about doing so. ""I didn't enjoy it and came back to what I now call the norm, which is isolation,"" she said. ""I think it is going to take a long time to adjust to get back into the flow of pre-March this year. ""And, being honest, I am worried about opening up and having to meet even family."" Outdoor sports and arts events to be trialled The retired office worker admitted she would ""love"" to see them, but feared the pandemic would return. ""Are we going to be ill next time around?"" she said. She did not enjoy her trip out because there were ""so many people"", many unmasked. ""It was totally alien,"" she said. ""I suppose I've become institutionalised being on my own."" The rules on meeting people indoorswere expected to be relaxed last weekend but were postponed.

"PSG fans gathered in Paris to celebrate their Champions League semi-final win A ban on Paris Saint-Germain fans wearing their team's shirt in the city centre of fierce rivals Marseille on Sunday has been rescinded. Police had announced the ban for when the Parisians take on Bayern Munich in the Champions League final. Clothing even ""displaying the colours of PSG"" was off-limits. But the order was later rolled back after the decision was met with widespread criticism. Justifying its initial ban, the police said ""there is strong animosity on the part of some Marseille residents, supporters or not, toward the PSG team, in contradiction with any sporting spirit"". The order came due to disturbances in Marseille during PSG'ssemi-final win over German side Leipzig. One man was arrested for attacking a man wearing a PSG shirt. Hundreds of Marseille fans sang anti-PSG songs and detonated firecrackers. But Bouches-du-RhÃ´ne police later backtracked on the order.

"Navalny was taken by ambulance to the airport in Omsk on Saturday morning The acutely ill Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny has arrived in Germany from Siberia for treatment. He is in a coma after drinking what his supporters suspect was poisoned tea; they accuse the authorities of trying to conceal a crime. Doctors treating him in Omsk had insisted on Friday that he was too ill to be moved. But they later said his condition was stable enough for the flight. His wife Yulia travelled with him. On Saturday morning, Mr Navalny's medical evacuation flight - paid for by the German non-governmental organisation Cinema for Peace - landed at Tegel airport in Berlin. He is being treated at the German capital's CharitÃ© hospital, which has said it does not expect to release a statement about his condition before Monday. The founder of the Cinema for Peace Foundation, activist and filmmaker Jaka Bizilj, told reporters outside the hospital that Mr Navalny's condition was ""very worrying"". ""It's not only about the question if he will survive this,"" he said. ""It's a question what kind of damage there is, if he will survive this and come back to normal fully."" Mr Navalny is in a coma on life support Mr Navalny's personal doctor, Anastasia Vasilieva, was not allowed to see him while he was in hospital in Russia. But she said she was hopeful he could recover now that he was in Germany. ""I'm sure that they can treat him and do everything to eliminate this toxic agent from his body."" Medical staff treating Mr Navalny at the hospital in Omsk said before his flight that his life was not in immediate danger. Mr Navalny's spokeswoman, Kira Yarmysh, earlier tweeted: ""Massive thanks to everyone for their support. The struggle for Alexei's life and health is just beginning."" Ms Yarmysh said it was a pity that doctors had taken so long to approve his flight as the plane and the right documents had been ready since Friday morning. The medical evacuation flight arrived at Tegel airport in Berlin on Saturday morning Mr Navalny fell ill during a flight from Tomsk to Moscow on Thursday, and his plane made an emergency landing in Omsk. A photograph on social media appeared to show him drinking from a cup at a Tomsk airport cafe before the flight. His team suspects a poisonous substance was put in his tea. Disturbing video appeared to show a stricken Mr Navalny howling in agony on the flight. Passenger Pavel Lebedev said he had heard the activist ""screaming in pain"". The head doctor at the hospital where Mr Navalny was being treated in Omsk, Alexander Murakhovsky, warned late on Friday that doctors did not recommend flying ""but his wife insists on her husband being transferred to a German clinic"". ""The patient's condition is stable,"" deputy chief doctor Anatoly Kalinichenko was quoted as saying by the Interfax news agency. Russia's vociferous Putin critic Mr Navalny fell ill during a flight on Thursday ""As we're in possession of a request from relatives to permit him to be transported somewhere, we have now taken the decision that we do not object to his transfer to another in-patient facility,"" Dr Kalinichenko said. Doctors said earlier that no poison had been found in his body, suggesting his condition might be the result of a ""metabolic disorder"" caused by low blood sugar. Health officials then indicated that traces of an industrial chemical had been found on his skin and hair. The local interior ministry told the Rapsi legal news agency thatthe chemical was usually included in polymers to improve their elasticity,external, but its concentration was impossible to establish. The prominent critic of President Vladimir Putin has consistently exposed official corruption in Russia. He has served multiple jail terms. At a news conference in Berlin on Friday, Mr Navalny's aide Leonid Volkov said at first doctors at the hospital had been helping to facilitate his transfer but had abruptly stopped doing so. Medical experts from Germany were allowed to see Mr Navalny ""[It was] like something was switched off - like medicine mode off, cover-up operation mode on - and the doctors refused to co-operate any more, refused to give any information even to Alexei's wife,"" he said. ""The doctors who were helping to do the paperwork to make the transportation of Alexei to CharitÃ© possible started to say that he's not any more transportable, he's not any more stable, contradicting themselves."" In 2018, the Cinema for Peace Foundation arranged for the treatment of Pyotr Verzilov - an activist with Russian protest group Pussy Riot - who had symptoms of poisoning. Mr Verzilov's ex-wife, activist Nadya Tolokonnikova, told BBC News that Mr Navalny's condition resembled the ""poisoning"" of her ex-husband. ""What German doctors told me after not finding poison in my ex-husband's blood is that the poison disappears in three days. So the Russian doctors only let him go when they were sure there was no traces of poison left,"" she explained. She also expressed surprise about what has happened to Mr Navalny: ""I thought Alexei was so powerful as a political figure that Mr Putin would not interfere."" Mr Navalny's wife Yulia wrote to President Putin asking him to allow her husband to be moved. She feared the Russian authorities were stalling so that evidence of any chemical substance would be lost. Mr Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Thursday that the Kremlin would help move Mr Navalny abroad if necessary and wished him a ""speedy recovery"". On Friday he said it was purely a medical decision. Foreign leaders including Germany's Angela Merkel and France's Emmanuel Macron have expressed concern for Mr Navalny. In the US, Democratic presidential candidateJoe Biden has described the incident as ""unacceptable"",externaland vowed that, if elected, he would ""stand up to autocrats like Putin"". After Mr Navalny was flown to Germany,UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab tweeted,external: ""It is vital that there is a full & transparent investigation into his poisoning."" April 2017:He was taken to hospital afteran antiseptic green dye was splashed on his facein Moscow. It was the second time he was targeted with zelyonka (""brilliant green"" in English) that year. ""It looks funny but it hurts like hell,"" he tweeted following the attack. This video can not be played Footage appears to show Mr Navalny being attacked with a green liquid in 2017 July 2019:He was sentenced to 30 days in prison after calling for unauthorised protests. He fell ill in jail and doctors said he had suffered an acute allergic reaction, diagnosing him with ""contact dermatitis"". His own doctor suggested he might have been exposed to ""some toxic agent"" and Mr Navalny saidhe thought he might have been poisoned.

"This video can not be played Holidaymakers return to the UK: ""We looked at alternative ways of getting back before the deadline"" UK tourists have spent thousands of pounds on new flights and endured long drives in a race to get home before new coronavirus travel rules kicked in. As of 04:00 BST on Saturday, travellers returning to the UK from Croatia, Austria and Trinidad and Tobago must quarantine for 14 days. Children in families who did not return in time will miss the start of school in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. But searches for flights to Portugal rose as it was put onthe safe list,external. Meanwhile, extra restrictions to stem the spread of Covid-19have come into forcein north-west England. It comes as a further 18 deaths have been recorded in the UK, bringing the total number of people to have died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus to 41,423. Why is Croatia on the quarantine list? And other questions What are the UK's travel rules? Where can I go on holiday without having to quarantine? The quarantine measures for Croatia, Austria and Trinidad and Tobago have been imposed because of a spike in coronavirus cases in those countries, the UK government has said. As of 21 August,the UK recorded 21.2 coronavirus cases per 100,000 people over the last fortnight,external, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. In comparison, Croatia had 47.2 cases per 100,000, Austria had 33.0 and Portugal 28.5. There were about 17,000 British tourists in Croatia on Friday, according to the country's national tourist board. On Friday evening, British Airways flights arriving from the Croatian city of Dubrovnik and the capital Zagreb at London's Heathrow airport were among the last to reach the UK before the deadline. People wait for planes at Croatia's Split airport on Thursday Jane Grist, from Walton-on-Thames, Surrey, said she was ""livid"" because the rule change meant her two sons would have to miss the first week of school after they return from the Croatian city of Sibenik, on 27 August. ""We've been focusing on the return to school as a return to normality,"" she said. ""Now we've got to explain [to our youngest son] he won't be able to go back at the same time as all of his friends."" Ms Grist said the holiday was ""the one thing we have been looking forward to"" after she was made redundant last year - and now it has been ""spoilt"". Frano MatuÅ¡iÄ, Croatia's State Secretary for Tourism, said his country was ""really disappointed"" by the new quarantine rules and urged the UK government to reverse its decision. ""We think that this decision was not fair because we think that Croatia is a really safe destination,"" he told Sky News. Another Friday, another country in Europe where hundreds of British tourists have frantically had to figure out ways to head home early. The airline authorities here in Split put on two extra flights on Friday to cope with the sudden demand. There were at least 500 passengers on board both aircraft. All were British travellers who booked last minute. ""It beggars belief. Why was there such short notice for us to leave?"" Karen, an English teacher, tells me. She'd just begun a week in Split and was in the middle of booking a ferry to Italy to get out of the country by the evening, because she said the UK flights had sold out. In the beautiful medieval town of Sibernik, a group of eight friends from Nottingham Trent University had given up efforts to get back early. Instead they drank beers in a harbour-side cafe. Lou, 20, said: ""We tried to get something, but everything was too expensive."" Her friend Amber added: ""It's upsetting because we planned this trip carefully, and quarantine means we can't go back to part-time work for two weeks, which sucks because it helped towards my university studies."" Neil Warnes and his wife Jane have spent about Â£2,000 cutting short their holiday in Austria Neil Warnes, 59, from Margate, was on holiday with his wife and two teenage children in an Alpine village in Austria when he heard the news on Thursday evening. The family spent about Â£2,000 to cut their holiday short by one day, in order to get home before the quarantine rules came into effect. They left Seefeld - a town with ""hardly any people there"" - at 02:00 on Friday to get to Munich airport, for an early morning flight to Heathrow. ""As our car was parked at Gatwick, another cab journey was needed and we finally arrived home in Kent at midday,"" Mr Warnes said. ""Austria appeared to be adhering to all social distancing measures and hand sanitation stations were in all the shops. Our small hotel had three alone on the ground floor. ""With this in mind we were so surprised when the government restrictions were put in place as Austria have had a historically low level since March. There didn't really appear to be any problems at all,"" he added. Another traveller, Cristiano Torti, 41, paid about Â£1,500 to fly his wife and two children back to the UK six days earlier than planned. He said they had lost about Â£500 of the original return flight bookings, but it would have been ""very difficult"" to quarantine with his young children as he and his wife both work from home. You finally got abroad, but was it worth it? Who decides which countries I can safely visit? This video can not be played How do I quarantine after returning from abroad? Mr Torti, a developer from Oxfordshire, said that his eldest child would have missed some of the new school term had the family not returned in time. ""We've lost a lot of of money, between the accommodation, the flights, and the knock-on effects: the car hire, the airport parking. I kind of wish we'd stayed home, despite the miserable British weather,"" he said. SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? JOBS:Can my boss force me to go to work? FACE MASKS:When should you wear one? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? GLOBAL SPREAD:Tracking the pandemic Meanwhile, Google search data showed a significant rise in searches for the term ""flights to Portugal"" by UK users at about 18:00 BST on Thursday; with a smaller spike at 07:00 BST on Friday morning. This video can not be played Coronavirus: How to fly during a global pandemic (this video reflects the rules before the hotel quarantine was introduced in the UK) Several EasyJet flights from London airports to Portugal were listed as unavailable for Saturday and Sunday, while airlines such as Jet2 laid on extra seats to Faro from Monday across the UK. Travel expert Simon Calder tweeted that the cost of flights from Manchester to Faro on Saturday morning had risen from Â£50 to Â£98 in 30 minutes. People who do not self-isolate when required can be fined up to Â£1,000 in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland. In Scotland the fine is Â£480, and up to Â£5,000 for persistent offenders. The UK introduced the compulsory 14-day quarantine for arrivals from overseas in early June. But the following month, the four UK nations unveiled lists of ""travel corridors"", detailing countries that were exempt from the rule. Since then it has periodically updated that list, adding and removing countries based on their coronavirus infection rates and how they compare with the UK's.

"This video can not be played Beirut blast: The families whose lives changed forever Lebanon will impose a two-week lockdown to contain a surge in coronavirus infections following the devastating explosion in Beirut two weeks ago. Markets, shopping centres, gyms and pools will have to close from Friday and there will be an overnight curfew. Officials reported a record 456 new cases of Covid-19 and two deaths on Monday, and 421 cases on Tuesday. Caretaker Health Minister Hamad Hassan has warned that hospitals are rapidly running out of space for new patients. ""The situation is unbearable,"" he told a local radio station on Monday. 'This can never be allowed to happen again' The inferno and the mystery ship Beirut explosion: Before-and-after images What we know about the blast Six major hospitals and 20 clinics sustained partial or heavy structural damage as a result of the huge blast at Beirut's port, which killed at least 178 people. Those medical facilities still functioning and field hospitals are treating thousands of patients for trauma and burns, as well as those more seriously injured. An estimated 300,000 people were also left homeless by the blast. Many are now living in damaged buildings, temporary sites or shared shelters, with limited access to water and sanitation. The disaster added to an already critical situation faced by Lebanon due to a severe economic downturn that has been compounded by the Covid-19 pandemic. The World Health Organization (WHO) said last week that Lebanon had done a ""very impressive job"" of tackling the coronavirus, which has killed at least 107 people in the country since February. However, before the blast there had been an upward trend in the daily numbers of new cases and the government had planned a partial lockdown to help manage hospitals' caseloads. Transmission rates have since increased and are expected to further increase in the coming weeks, as many people have been unable to follow precautionary measures, such as social distancing. Six major hospitals and 20 clinics sustained partial or heavy structural damage The UN is concerned about the high risk of exposure for health workers,externaldue to overcrowding in hospital emergency departments; shortages of personal protection equipment (PPE); increased population vulnerability; and reduced numbers of beds and intensive care unit capacity. It has said the procurement of tests and community-based surveillance among newly displaced people is critical, as is the distribution of PPE and disinfection and hygiene supplies to vulnerable groups. The WHO has shipped almost 25 tonnes of PPE to Beirut and the Lebanese health ministry has established clinics to conduct Covid-19 tests in two of the areas worst affected by the explosion. Overseas medical teams have also been asked by the WHO to repurpose their field hospitals to boost capacity for treating coronavirus patients.

"Spain saw one of the most draconian Covid-19 lockdowns in Europe, but two months after it was lifted, the virus is spreading faster than in any neighbouring nation. It now has Europe's fastest-rising caseload, with 142 positive cases per 100,000 inhabitants over the past two weeks. By the time the state of emergency ended on 21 June, Spain was registering 100 to 150 cases per day. That number has risen to more than 3,000. But the number of deaths over the past week stood at 122 on Thursday, a far cry from the 950 registered on 2 April alone, the blackest day in Europe's deadliest per capita coronavirus epidemic. Most of the transmission is now between young people, and around three-quarters of positives are in patients who show no symptoms. Spain's government admits the numbers are ""not what we want to see"", but points to key differences compared to the spring. Only around 3% of current cases require hospital treatment, less than 0.5% need intensive care and the current death rate is as low as 0.3%. ""Mortality is very low, as is the hospitalisation rate. Something has changed big time, although the rise is still worrying,"" says Ildefonso HernÃ¡ndez, a professor in public health from Miguel HernÃ¡ndez University in Alicante. ""As long as cases are rising, we have to think that a second wave is on the way. We don't have much time to react before September's return to routines."" This video can not be played Magaluf's famous party streets are now like a ghost town Spain's tourism season has ended up as little more than a damp squib, as most countries moved to blacklist this key destination within weeks of the country opening up at the end of June. That means beach areas have so far avoided the highest rates of infection, althoughCatalonia's infection rate is slightly above the national average on 145 cases per 100,000 inhabitants. Healthcare is a competence of Spain's 17 regions, and some are looking much better prepared than others. At the good end of the scale, the northern region ofAsturiashas an infection rate of 32, whileAragÃ³nin the north-east is topping 500. AragÃ³n's capital, Zaragoza, has become a hotspot for community transmission over recent weeks, but the problems began in the early summer when thousands of seasonal workers, many of them wandering migrants, began to travel to orchards in the region. Growers and packing companies have been criticised for not providing accommodation for migrant workers, leading them to travel between shelters and fields or subsist in insanitary shanties. ""Everything happening in AragÃ³n is very much connected to outbreaks among the seasonal fruit-pickers. There should have been more anticipation of the problems that could arise due to the accommodation situation of these workers,"" explains Juan GonzÃ¡lez Armengol, president of the Spanish Society of Emergency Medicine (Semes). Worst of all, more than 55 care homes for the elderly in AragÃ³n have registered cases since the end of the state of emergency. This team disinfected a nursing home for the elderly in the city of Teruel in early August There is a risk that areas that escaped the worst ravages of the spring pandemic could be hit by a second wave as autumn nears. In June, AragÃ³n estimated around 760 deaths in residences, 10 times fewer than in Madrid. Spanish politics has lacked any consensus or spirit of collaboration in managing the coronavirus crisis. While the national government of Socialist Prime Minister Pedro SÃ¡nchez has faced accusations from rivals of lying about death rates, the regional government in Madrid run by the conservative Popular Party has attracted equally fierce criticism. Despite a shocking collapse of Madrid's public hospital system in the spring, and with 50% more deaths than the more populous region of Catalonia, the capital is now seeing cases double week after week. Madridâs medical heroes in fight of their lives Spanish regions ban smoking over Covid-19 risk Spain's holiday islands shake off party image Waiting for tourists on Spain's Costa del Sol Madrid had fewer than 200 contact tracers by the end of July. Double that number had been promised, and even that was half the figure recommended by the medical community. This video can not be played Watch as anti-mask protesters take to the streets of Madrid ""Among the factors for the high infection numbers we are seeing, the quality of Spain's democracy is playing a part. Were accountability stricter, it would not be acceptable that some regions - and not just Madrid - are taking so long to put measures in place,"" says Prof HernÃ¡ndez. Officially, 28,813 have died from Covid-19 - Spain's health ministry counts only those who tested positive for the virus According to excess death statistics, close to 44,596 are believed to have died from the illness The Spanish government says more than 19,000 elderly people have died in care homes, although only around half have been included in the official death toll As infections surged, hospitals in many areas stopped sending ambulances to care homes, so residents died undiagnosed and often with very little treatment ""Never again can we leave our old people to die alone and afraid,"" said Ximena Di Lollo of Doctors Without Borders, which has criticised a lack of preparation and poor staffing levels. Inside story of Spain's care home tragedy For three months, Spaniards were under lockdown. That meant many young people were stuck in their family homes. Perhaps unsurprisingly, street parties and night life are now being signalled as the biggest catalysts of new outbreaks along with family gatherings. Town and city festivals have all been cancelled. That did not stop crowds gathering inNavarre's capital of Pamplona for the 7 July start date of the world-famous San FermÃ­n bull-running fiesta. The traditional running of the bulls was cancelled but these traditional singers turned up for the first day Last Friday 400 young revellers paraded the streets of nearby Tafalla, marking the town's ""non-festival"". In the neighbouringBasque Country, which is just ahead of Navarre as Spain's third worst-affected region this month, youthful gatherings have also been linked to outbreaks. Of the 350 people called to turn up for testing after a busy night at Bilbao's Back&Stage nightclub last month, at least 34 proved positive, the kind of result that has prompted an agreement between Spain's authorities to close down all nightlife after 01:00. ""It was like any other night at the club and many people were not wearing a face mask even when dancing. I was among the first to take mine off,"" 18-year-old Arkaitz Serrano told newspaper El PaÃ­s. In Madrid as well as the Basque Country alcohol-fuelled outdoor gatherings have deepened the problem ""Spaniards were extremely fastidious about following the rules during the lockdown, but there has been a massive relaxation now we have returned to a kind of normality,"" notes Prof HernÃ¡ndez. Under new emergency powers, the Basque government this week banned so-called botellÃ³n parties, alcohol-fuelled outdoor gatherings of young people. But the botellÃ³n is a national problem. In Madrid the regional government has asked for police reinforcements to seek out and break up such parties, whose numbers are rising as restrictions on nightclubs and bars take effect.

"Travellers returning from Croatia and Austria will have to self-isolate in the UK from this weekend, but Portugal is now on the list of countries exempt from quarantine. Here are some readers questions about the latest travel rules. You will not need to quarantine when returning from Dublin. However, the UK is currently on Ireland's ""orange"" list. This means that once you get to Dublin, you will need to restrict your movement as much as possible. This includes only going to shops and the pharmacy in exceptional circumstances, and you are not advised to see others. No, you don't need to quarantine when you get into France. However, you will have to when you come back to the UK for 14 days. Additionally, it is worth checking whether there are still any local lockdown rules in the region where you're going. All passengers landing in Greece must havea valid passenger landing form,external, which includes a QR code. This can be either printed or on your phone, according to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. It can take up to 14 days for coronavirus symptoms to appear, according to the Department of Health and Social Care. The period between catching the virus and showing symptoms is known as the incubation period. During incubation a test might not be effective at picking up symptoms. You should try and organise the funeral remotely as much as possible and ask friends or family to help wherever possible. However, the government guidelines do allow for you to leave the house to attend a funeral during quarantine. Remember, funerals are currently subject to their own strict rules, including a maximum 30-person limit. It's not entirely clear. At the moment, the government does not publish the criteria for its decisions regarding quarantine, although it is thought to take into account a number of factors, such as the number of people affected, the number of deaths and the country's testing capacity. Croatia was put on the list because it has recently seen a spike in infections. There have been calls for more transparency about the process. Earlier this month, MPs on the Home Affairs Select Committee urged the government to publish the analysis behind its decisions, saying: ""It will build more support for the difficult balancing judgements it has to take if it is open about the evidence behind them."" People enjoyed sunny weather on this Dubrovnik beach this week Not necessarily. If you travel through the Netherlands and you don't stop in the country, you will not need to self-isolate when you return to the UK. If you do make a stop in the Netherlands, you can still avoid quarantine if: no new people get into the vehicle nobody gets out of the car, mixes with people and then gets back into the car Travellers from affected countries - including UK nationals - are asked to provide an address where they will self-isolate for 14 days. They can be fined Â£100 for failing to provide these details. One in five eligible passengers will be called or texted to check they are following the rules. People who do not self-isolate can be fined up to Â£1,000 in England, Wales and Northern Ireland and Â£480 in Scotland. There are fines up to Â£5,000 for persistent offenders. You do not need to isolate but your parents do, if they are returning from a country on the quarantine list. Moving out would be one solution to this, but you could stay at home as long as you are able to avoid contact with each other as much as possible. Government advice to people self-isolating,externalsays: ""It's important to avoid as much contact with other people as possible in your home in order to reduce the risk of transmitting coronavirus. You should stay in a well-ventilated room with a window to the outside that can be opened, separate from other people in your home."" As your parents will not be able to leave home (except for emergencies) during the self-isolation period, they may be glad of your assistance bringing food shopping to the house, for instance. UK tourists face new quarantine deadline race What are the UK travel quarantine rules? What are the UK's travel rules and which countries can you visit? Yes she does. Anyone who arrives in the UK from Portugal before 0400 BST on 22 August still has to self-isolate for two weeks. If you are already self-isolating, you need to continue doing so for 14 days after you arrived in the UK. The Department for Transport (DfT) says that 04:00 BST is a quiet time for flights, so there's less chance of travel disruption. With countries such as Croatia, Austria or - to take those added to the quarantine list last week - France and the Netherlands, the public health risks were not considered so high that quarantine needed to be introduced immediately. By allowing 36 hours' notice, the DfT said it could give travellers as much notice as possible and allow quarantine to be implemented successfully.

"Navalny was taken by ambulance to the airport in Omsk on Saturday morning The acutely ill Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny has arrived in Germany from Siberia for treatment. He is in a coma after drinking what his supporters suspect was poisoned tea; they accuse the authorities of trying to conceal a crime. Doctors treating him in Omsk had insisted on Friday that he was too ill to be moved. But they later said his condition was stable enough for the flight. His wife Yulia travelled with him. On Saturday morning, Mr Navalny's medical evacuation flight - paid for by the German non-governmental organisation Cinema for Peace - landed at Tegel airport in Berlin. He is being treated at the German capital's CharitÃ© hospital, which has said it does not expect to release a statement about his condition before Monday. The founder of the Cinema for Peace Foundation, activist and filmmaker Jaka Bizilj, told reporters outside the hospital that Mr Navalny's condition was ""very worrying"". ""It's not only about the question if he will survive this,"" he said. ""It's a question what kind of damage there is, if he will survive this and come back to normal fully."" Mr Navalny is in a coma on life support Mr Navalny's personal doctor, Anastasia Vasilieva, was not allowed to see him while he was in hospital in Russia. But she said she was hopeful he could recover now that he was in Germany. ""I'm sure that they can treat him and do everything to eliminate this toxic agent from his body."" Medical staff treating Mr Navalny at the hospital in Omsk said before his flight that his life was not in immediate danger. Mr Navalny's spokeswoman, Kira Yarmysh, earlier tweeted: ""Massive thanks to everyone for their support. The struggle for Alexei's life and health is just beginning."" Ms Yarmysh said it was a pity that doctors had taken so long to approve his flight as the plane and the right documents had been ready since Friday morning. The medical evacuation flight arrived at Tegel airport in Berlin on Saturday morning Mr Navalny fell ill during a flight from Tomsk to Moscow on Thursday, and his plane made an emergency landing in Omsk. A photograph on social media appeared to show him drinking from a cup at a Tomsk airport cafe before the flight. His team suspects a poisonous substance was put in his tea. Disturbing video appeared to show a stricken Mr Navalny howling in agony on the flight. Passenger Pavel Lebedev said he had heard the activist ""screaming in pain"". The head doctor at the hospital where Mr Navalny was being treated in Omsk, Alexander Murakhovsky, warned late on Friday that doctors did not recommend flying ""but his wife insists on her husband being transferred to a German clinic"". ""The patient's condition is stable,"" deputy chief doctor Anatoly Kalinichenko was quoted as saying by the Interfax news agency. Russia's vociferous Putin critic Mr Navalny fell ill during a flight on Thursday ""As we're in possession of a request from relatives to permit him to be transported somewhere, we have now taken the decision that we do not object to his transfer to another in-patient facility,"" Dr Kalinichenko said. Doctors said earlier that no poison had been found in his body, suggesting his condition might be the result of a ""metabolic disorder"" caused by low blood sugar. Health officials then indicated that traces of an industrial chemical had been found on his skin and hair. The local interior ministry told the Rapsi legal news agency thatthe chemical was usually included in polymers to improve their elasticity,external, but its concentration was impossible to establish. The prominent critic of President Vladimir Putin has consistently exposed official corruption in Russia. He has served multiple jail terms. At a news conference in Berlin on Friday, Mr Navalny's aide Leonid Volkov said at first doctors at the hospital had been helping to facilitate his transfer but had abruptly stopped doing so. Medical experts from Germany were allowed to see Mr Navalny ""[It was] like something was switched off - like medicine mode off, cover-up operation mode on - and the doctors refused to co-operate any more, refused to give any information even to Alexei's wife,"" he said. ""The doctors who were helping to do the paperwork to make the transportation of Alexei to CharitÃ© possible started to say that he's not any more transportable, he's not any more stable, contradicting themselves."" In 2018, the Cinema for Peace Foundation arranged for the treatment of Pyotr Verzilov - an activist with Russian protest group Pussy Riot - who had symptoms of poisoning. Mr Verzilov's ex-wife, activist Nadya Tolokonnikova, told BBC News that Mr Navalny's condition resembled the ""poisoning"" of her ex-husband. ""What German doctors told me after not finding poison in my ex-husband's blood is that the poison disappears in three days. So the Russian doctors only let him go when they were sure there was no traces of poison left,"" she explained. She also expressed surprise about what has happened to Mr Navalny: ""I thought Alexei was so powerful as a political figure that Mr Putin would not interfere."" Mr Navalny's wife Yulia wrote to President Putin asking him to allow her husband to be moved. She feared the Russian authorities were stalling so that evidence of any chemical substance would be lost. Mr Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Thursday that the Kremlin would help move Mr Navalny abroad if necessary and wished him a ""speedy recovery"". On Friday he said it was purely a medical decision. Foreign leaders including Germany's Angela Merkel and France's Emmanuel Macron have expressed concern for Mr Navalny. In the US, Democratic presidential candidateJoe Biden has described the incident as ""unacceptable"",externaland vowed that, if elected, he would ""stand up to autocrats like Putin"". After Mr Navalny was flown to Germany,UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab tweeted,external: ""It is vital that there is a full & transparent investigation into his poisoning."" April 2017:He was taken to hospital afteran antiseptic green dye was splashed on his facein Moscow. It was the second time he was targeted with zelyonka (""brilliant green"" in English) that year. ""It looks funny but it hurts like hell,"" he tweeted following the attack. This video can not be played Footage appears to show Mr Navalny being attacked with a green liquid in 2017 July 2019:He was sentenced to 30 days in prison after calling for unauthorised protests. He fell ill in jail and doctors said he had suffered an acute allergic reaction, diagnosing him with ""contact dermatitis"". His own doctor suggested he might have been exposed to ""some toxic agent"" and Mr Navalny saidhe thought he might have been poisoned.
