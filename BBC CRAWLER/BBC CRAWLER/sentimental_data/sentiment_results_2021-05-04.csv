"Joe McCann was shot near his home in the Markets area of Belfast in April 1972 Two former paratroopers accused of the murder of an Official IRA man in 1972 have been formally acquitted after their trial collapsed. Joe McCann, 24, was shot in disputed circumstances at Joy Street in the Markets area of Belfast in April 1972. The court heard he was evading arrest when soldiers opened fire, killing him. Soldiers A and C, both in their 70s, had pleaded not guilty. The men admitted firing shots but said they had acted lawfully when doing so. Both soldiers were interviewed by a police legacy unit, the Historical Enquiries Team (HET), in 2010 and it was that evidence which formed a substantial part of the prosecution's case. The judge ruled that evidence as inadmissible and the Public Prosecution Service (PPS) confirmed on Tuesday it would not appeal against that decision, meaning the case could not proceed. After the prosecution confirmed it would be presenting no further evidence in the case, the judge told both former soldiers: ""In the circumstances, Mr A and C, I formally find you not guilty of the charge of murder."" Speaking outside court, Mr McCann's daughter AÃ­ne said there had been ""a failure of the state at all levels"" in relation to her father's death. ""The RUC (Royal Ulster Constabulary) failed, the criminal justice failed, not only in this case but in the case of many other families,"" she said. Mr McCann's daughters Maura and AÃ­ne accompanied his widow Anne (centre) and son Fergal (right) to court Mr McCann's family are to apply to the attorney general to open an inquest into his killing. Their solicitor Niall Murphy said: ""This ruling does not acquit the state of murder."" He added: ""Today is not the end of the McCanns' journey for justice."" It will take time for the fallout from the collapse of this case to become clear. Firstly, prosecutors will examine the implications, if any, for other Troubles legacy cases involving Army veterans. In four of them, decisions to bring charges have already been made - three other cases have still to be ruled upon. In each of the cases, input from the Historical Enquiries Team (HET) will be looked at closely. However, at this stage prosecutors do not anticipate there being a huge impact. Secondly, Tuesday's development will likely intensify the debate around future Troubles prosecutions and legacy matters generally. Political capital will be made from what has happened in a Belfast courtroom. The government wants to bring forward legislation protecting veterans who served in Northern Ireland and all ears will be on the Queen's speech next week. Solicitors for the former soldiers said the prosecution should ""never have got off the ground"" and called for an inquiry led by a senior judge to investigate ""the decision-making process and to ensure that the decision to prosecute these veterans was not political."" In a statement, the PPS confirmed it had decided to offer no further evidence against two former soldiers. Michael Agnew, the deputy director of public prosecutions, said that in spite of the verdict the PPS was satisfied the case had been properly brought before the courts. He said evidence received in 2016 relating to the case was subjected to ""a very thorough and careful examination by a team of experienced lawyers, including senior counsel"" before the test for prosecution was met. ""The case overcame a number of legal challenges before reaching trial,"" he said. Political reaction to collapse of soldiers' trial ""These challenges included an abuse of process application following which a High Court judge ruled that there was no unfairness in the decision to prosecute and that in all the circumstances the defendants could get a fair trial."" He added that the PPS ""fully respected"" the judge's ruling and acknowledged ""the enduring pain of the McCann family and how difficult this development has been for them"". Mr Agnew said when the full written judgement became available, the PPS would ""carefully consider whether it has the potential to impact upon any other cases that are currently before the courts"". Det Supt Stephen Wright of PSNI's legacy investigation branch said: ""We will await the publication of the written judgment and take time to consider it fully and any impact it might have on other legacy investigations."" The trial opened last Monday and heard a day of evidence before moving to the issue of whether statements and interviews given by the ex-soldiers would be admissible. The court was told that evidence implicating the soldiers came from two sources - statements given to the Royal Military Police in 1972 and interview answers given to the HET in 2010. The PPS accepted that the 1972 statements would be inadmissible in isolation, due to deficiencies in how they were taken including that the soldiers were ordered to make them and they were not conducted under caution. Former Veterans Minister Johnny Mercer attended the trial in Belfast However, prosecutors argued that the information in the 1972 statements became admissible because they were adopted and accepted by the defendants during their engagement with the HET in March 2010. However, the judge said it was not legitimate to put the 1972 evidence before the court ""dressed up and freshened up with a new 2010 cover"". He questioned why the HET's re-examination did not prompt a fresh investigation by the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI), with the veterans interviewed under caution. The judge suggested that course of action might have made a prosecution more sustainable. Former Veterans Minister Johnny Mercer, who left the government in April over legal protections for troops who served during the Troubles in Northern Ireland, attended the trial. Speaking after it collapsed, he said he was ""delighted"" for the former soldiers, adding he hoped they could ""go and live the rest of their lives in peace"". ""The government has made very clear promises, and the prime minister has made very clear promises, on legislation to end the relentless pursuit of those who served their country in Northern Ireland,"" he said. ""It is time to deliver on that."" Four other cases in relation to Army veterans are currently before the courts.

"On Monday, a senior official from India's federal government told journalists that there was no shortage of oxygen in Delhi or anywhere else in the country. As he spoke, several small hospitals - only a few miles from where he stood in the capital - were sending out desperate messages about them running out of oxygen, putting patients' lives at risk. The chief doctor of one of the hospitals - a specialist paediatric facility - told the BBC that ""our hearts were in our mouths"" because of the risk of children dying. They got supplies just in time, after a local politician intervened. Delhi oxygen crisis deepens as more patients die Anger rises as Covid rages in Modi's constituency A visual guide to the Covid crisis in India Barkha Dutt on her father's Covid-19 death And yet, the federal government has repeatedly insisted that there was no shortage. ""We are only facing problems in its transportation,"" Piyush Goyal, a senior official from India's home ministry, said. He also advised hospitals to ""ensure judicious use of oxygen as per the guidelines"". Several doctors who have spoken to the BBC say they are giving oxygen only to patients who need it, but there is not enough. But experts say that the shortage of oxygen is just one of the problems which shows both federal and state governments were not prepared, having failed to do enough to stop or minimise the damage of the second wave. A street in Delhi in early March, when, despite warnings, Indiaâs health minister said the country was in the âendgameâ of Covid-19 Warnings have in fact been repeatedly issued, including: In November, aparliamentary standing committee on health said there was an inadequate supply of oxygen,externaland ""grossly inadequate"" government hospital beds In February, several experts told the BBCthey feared an impending 'Covid tsunami' In early March, an expert group of scientists, set up by the government,warned officials about a more contagious variant of coronavirus spreading in the country,external- only for no significant containment measures to be taken, one scientist from the group told the BBC. The government has not made any comment on the allegations Despite this, on 8 March, the country's health minister announced thatIndia was in the ""endgame of the pandemic,external"". So, where did it go so wrong? In January and February, the national number of daily cases fell to under 20,000 from peaks of around 90,000 in September last year. Prime Minister Narendra Modi declared Covid beaten, andall places of public gathering opened. And soon, people were not adhering to Covid safety protocols, thanks in part to confused messaging from the top. While Mr Modi asked people to wear masks and follow social distancing in his public messages, he addressed large unmasked crowds during his election campaigns in five states. A number of his ministers were also seen addressing large public gatherings without wearing masks. The Kumbh Mela, a Hindu festival - which attracts millions - was also allowed to go ahead. The Kumbh Mela religious festival in mid-April, which, like political rallies at the time, were attended unmasked ""There was complete disconnect between what they practised and what they preached,"" says public policy and health systems expert Dr Chandrakant Lahariya. Prominent virologist Dr Shahid Jameel says ""the government just did not see the second wave coming and started celebrating too early"". But there is more to the story: the devastation has also exposed the underfunding and neglect of the public healthcare system in India. The heart-breaking scenesthat have been witnessed outside hospitals - people dying without getting treatment - shows the grim reality of India's healthcare infrastructure. As one expert puts it, India's ""public health infrastructure was always broken, the rich and the middle class are just finding out"". Those who could afford it have always relied on private hospitals for treatment, while the poor struggle to get even a doctor's appointment. Recent schemes, like health insurance and subsidised medicines for the poor, are not helping because very little has been done in decades to increase the number of medical staff or hospitals. India's healthcare spending, including both private and public, has been around 3.6% of GDP for the past six years, the lowest percentage in the five Brics countries: Brazil spent the most at 9.2%, followed by South Africa at 8.1%, Russia at 5.3% and China at 5% in 2018. Developed nations spend a far higher proportion of their GDP on health.  In 2018, for instance, spending in the US was 16.9% and Germany 11.2%. Even smaller nations like Sri Lanka (3.76%) and Thailand (3.79%) spend more than India. And India has fewer than 10 doctors per 10,000 people, and in some states the figure is less than five. Several ""empowered committees"" were last year looking at the preparations needed to tackle the next coronavirus wave, so experts are baffled by the shortages of oxygen, beds and drugs. ""When the first wave was tapering, that's when they should have prepared for a second wave and assumed the worst. They should have taken an inventory of oxygen and [the drug] remdesivir and then ramped up manufacturing capacity,"" Mahesh Zagade, former health secretary of Maharashtra state, told the BBC. Officials say India produces enough oxygen to meet the spike in demand but transportation was the problem. Experts say this should have been fixed much earlier. The government is now running special trains carrying oxygen from one state to another and stopping use of oxygen in industries - but only aftermany patients died because of a lack of oxygen. Very ill patients have been stuck outside hospitals as they wait for beds to become available ""The outcome has been that desperate family members are spending thousands of rupees to secure an oxygen cylinder on the black market and then stand for hours in a queue to get it filled,"" points out Dr Lahariya. Meanwhile, those who can afford itare also paying hefty amounts to procure drugs like remdesivir and tocilizumab. An executive from a pharmaceutical company which manufactures remdesivir said ""demand had dried up"" in January and February.  ""If the government had placed an order, we would have stockpiled and there wouldn't have been any shortage. We have ramped up production but demand has grown significantly,"" he said. In contrast, the southern state of Kerala planned for the surge in advance. Dr A Fathahudeen, who is part of the state's Covid taskforce, says there was no shortage of oxygen in the state as necessary steps were taken in October last year. Relatives of patients have been refilling oxygen cylinders themselves ""We also procured sufficient stock of remdesivir and tocilizumab and other drugs well in advance. We also have a surge plan in place to tackle any exponential rise in the numbers in the coming weeks,"" he says. Mr Zagade says other states should have also taken similar steps ""to avoid the suffering"". ""Learning means someone else has done it and you can do it now, but that means it will take time,"" the former health secretary for Maharashtra said. But time is running out as the second wave is now spreading to villages where healthcare systems are not equipped to deal with the surge. Genome sequencing of the virus is an important step in identifying new variants that could be more infectious and deadly. The Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genomic Consortia (INSACOG) was set up last year and it brought together 10 labs in the country. But the group reportedly struggled to get funding initially,external. Virologist Dr Jameel says India started seriously looking at mutations fairly late, with sequencing efforts only ""properly started"" in mid-February 2021. India is sequencing just over 1% of all samples at the moment. ""In comparison, the UK was sequencing at 5-6% at the peak of the pandemic. But you can't build such capacity overnight,"" he said. However, India's main hope was always vaccination. This woman wanted to record the moment of vaccination ""Any public health specialist will tell you there is no practical way to strengthen an already broken public healthcare system in a matter of months,"" one woman, whose family runs a large private hospital in Delhi, told the BBC. ""The best and most effective alternative to battle Covid was to vaccinate the population as quickly as possible so the majority wouldn't need hospital care and hence not overburden the healthcare system."" India initially wanted 300 million people vaccinated by July, ""but it seems the government did not do enough planning to secure vaccine supply to run the programme"", Dr Lahariya says. ""On top of it, it has opened the vaccination for all adults without securing vaccine supplies."" So far, only about 26 million people have been fully vaccinated out of a population of 1.4 billion, and about 124 million have received a single dose. India has millions more doses on order, but still far short of what it actually needs. The federal government needs 615 million doses to vaccinate everyone above the age of 45 - about 440 million people. There are 622 million people between the age of 18 and 44, and 1.2 billion doses are required to vaccinate them. India's vaccine shortage: The wait gets longer What is the India Covid variant? The government has also cancelled exports, reneging on international commitments. The government has enlisted other firms like Biological E and the state-run Haffkine Institute to produce vaccines. It has also given credit support of $609m to the Serum Institute of India, which produces the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab which is being made in India as Covishield, to ramp up production. But that funding should have come earlier, Dr Lahariya says, saving precious lives. ""It will take months before we have enough vaccines to speed up the programme. In the meantime, millions will continue to be at risk of getting Covid,"" he adds. Experts say it is ironic that India is known as the world's pharmacy and it is now facing shortages of vaccines and drugs. All of this, Dr Lahariya says, should serve as wake-up call for for both federal and state governments, which should invest drastically more in the healthcare sector because ""this definitely is not the last pandemic we will have to fight against"". ""The future pandemic may come earlier than any model can predict,"" he says.

"Tensions with the UK have made Channel waters choppier for French trawlers The French government has warned it could cut electricity to Jersey amid an escalating row over post-Brexit fishing rights. Maritime Minister Annick Girardin told the French parliament that new rules governing access to Channel Islands waters were unacceptable. She said France was ""ready to use... retaliatory measures"" under the UK-EU post-Brexit trade deal. ""I am sorry it has come to this [but] we will do so if we have to,"" she said. Jersey, the largest of the Channel Islands, receives 95% of its electricity through three underwater cables from France. What does the deal mean for fishing? European Parliament backs Brexit trade deal Who really owns UK fishing rights? In a statement to AFP news agency, the French fisheries ministry said the UK had introduced ""new technical measures"" linked to licences for fishing off the Channel Islands which had not been communicated to the EU and were therefore ""null and void"". Meanwhile, the UK's Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""We are clear that Jersey is responsible for its own territorial waters."" The latest comments mark an escalation in the row over fishing rights, which has been simmering for months and marked a key sticking point in post-Brexit trade talks. French fishermen have complained of being prevented from operating in British waters because of difficulties in obtaining licences. To receive a licence under an agreement with the EU, French boat operators have to show a history of fishing in the area. Jersey has the sole power to issue the licences, and as of last week all fishing boats are required to have a licence to operate there. On Friday, the Jersey government granted 41 permits to French fishing vessels that are equipped with technology that allows them to be located. But the French government claimed the list of approved ships came with further demands that ""were not arranged or discussed, and which we were not notified about"". The French fisheries ministry said the new rules dictated ""where the ships can go and cannot go"" as well as the number of days fishermen can spend in the area. ""This is absolutely unacceptable,"" Ms Girardin said. ""If we accept this for Jersey, it would imperil our access everywhere."" Last week, French Europe Minister ClÃ©ment Beaune accused the UK more broadly of blocking fishing rights. He said the EU could respond with ""reprisals"" in financial services. Meanwhile, British seafood exporters have been hit by an EU ban on UK exports of live shellfish such as mussels, oysters, clams, cockles and scallops. The UK has also failed to strike a new fishing agreement with Norway. That failure threatens to prevent British trawlers catching cod in Norway's sub-Arctic seas.

"The secondhand areas in Ikea stores will be called Circular Hubs Ikea has launched its long-awaited furniture buy-back and re-sale scheme, in an attempt to reduce the number of products going to landfill. The move is part of the retail giant's sustainability drive to become ""climate positive"" by 2030. Customers will get vouchers to spend in-store if items they no longer need are returned in good condition. Ikea admitted the scheme was a learning curve, but decided to launch it after successful trials in several cities. ""I'm not saying we have all the answers, but we learned enough from the pilots to tell us that this could be something of real value to us and our customers,"" Hege Saebjornsen, an environmental and sustainability expert at Ikea, told the BBC. The initiative, originally scheduled to launch in November but postponed because of the pandemic, is now available in Ikea stores across the UK. It is also being launched in the other 26 countries in which Ikea operates. Used products returned in as-new condition with no scratches will be bought for 50% of the original price, while items with minor scratches will be bought for 40%. Furniture that is well used with several scratches will be bought for 30%. The items will be sold in separate areas of the stores, although Ikea has also announced a new partnership with Gumtree to sell second-hand products via the online marketplace. Sustainability key to long-term corporate health Ikea France on trial for snooping on staff Ikea to start selling spare parts for products Products eligible for buy-back include dressers, cabinets, bookcases and shelf units, small tables, dining tables and desks. The Swedish company has already announced it wants to become fully ""circular"" - eliminate waste through the continual use of materials - by 2030. Ingka Group, Ikea's parent company, recently announced it was investing â¬4bn in renewable energy. Customers wanting to sell back furniture go to Ikea.co.uk to fill out an online form, which generates a preliminary offer, and then take items to a store. Ikea is trialling Pre-Loved Labels, giving customers information about an item's past. Ms Saebjornsen, a former sustainability manager at the retailer and now an Ikea adviser on the forthcoming COP26 climate summit, said that exactly what the consumer uptake will be is unknown. But she said the trials, including in Sydney, Lisbon, Edinburgh and Glasgow, ""were really successful. It taught us a lot about the appetite for this and how people behave"". The second-hand market generally - from clothing to homeware - is growing rapidly as shopping habits change, and Ikea hopes to tap into this, she said. One potential drawback was that furniture must be delivered fully-assembled, a possible impediment for people who have heavy and bulky items. ""We still found people are taking us up on it [the scheme],"" she said. Ikea is working on how to improve the disassembly of products. ""Some are better than others. Products can get damaged when taken apart, so we can only really accept assembled products. It maintains the security and quality of the item,"" she said. Although Ikea is offering vouchers, not cash, the scheme is not being introduced as a profit driver for the retailer, she said. Still, doesn't it reinforce a buy-new, disposable culture? ""We've taken all of that into account,"" Ms Saebjornsen said. ""It's really important to highlight that the voucher has no use-by date. They can be used to buy another second hand item, or food. ""The real consideration here is that it's about how we make sustainable and healthy living easy, accessible and affordable, and really mainstream. ""Ikea is such a large company with massive potential to reach millions of customers. ""We are not saying that we have all the answers. But small actions can make a difference."" The buy-back service is available in full-sized Ikea stores nationwide, excluding order and collection points in Tottenham Court Road, Norwich and Aberdeen. The service will launch in Reading and Belfast on 17 May.

"Yair Lapid promised to do everything he could to form a unity government as soon as possible Israel's president has asked the leader of the centrist Yesh Atid party, Yair Lapid, to try to form a government. Reuven Rivlin announced that he had given Mr Lapid the mandate after long-time Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu failed to meet an overnight deadline. Yesh Atid came second to Mr Netanyahu's right-wing Likud party in March's inconclusive general election. Mr Lapid faces a challenge to bridge the ideological differences between the parties he can ask to join a coalition. If he fails to secure a majority in the 120-seat parliament, the Knesset, there is a risk of the country having to go to elections for the fifth time in two years. Mr Netanyahu's right-wing Likud party is the largest in the Knesset, with 30 seats In a televised address on Wednesday evening, President Rivlin said he had decided to give Mr Lapid a 28-day mandate to form a government after 56 lawmakers expressed support for his candidacy. ""From the number of recommendations, it is clear that Yair Lapid could form a government that has the confidence of the Knesset, despite there being many difficulties,"" he added. He noted that Naftali Bennett, the leader of the right-wing Yamina party, which has seven seats, had called for a stable government and not ruled out the possibility of joining a coalition with Mr Lapid. Mansour Abbas, the head of the Arab Islamist party Raam, which has four seats, had meanwhile stated that he would ""co-operate positively"" with anyone given a mandate, he added. In a statement after the announcement, Mr Lapid promised to do everything he could to form a government as soon as possible. ""After two years of political paralysis, Israeli society is hurting. A unity government isn't a compromise or a last resort - it's a goal, it's what we need,"" he said. ""We need a government that will reflect the fact that we don't hate one another. A government in which left, right and centre will work together to tackle the economic and security challenges we face. A government that will show that our differences are a source of strength, not weakness."" Israel election hopes and fears play out in crater town Israel's Benjamin Netanyahu: Commando turned PM The 57-year-old former finance minister has previously said that he would be prepared to share the premiership with Mr Bennett as part of a rotation agreement, with the latter leading the country for the first two years. Earlier on Wednesday, Mr Bennett called for the formation of a ""broad emergency government"" that would ""get the wheel out of the mud"". ""This is the time to stop and reconsider a new path. Whoever cynically takes the State of Israel to fifth elections based on personal interests, in complete opposition to the needs of the nation and state, the people won't forgive him."" Benjamin Netanyahu was given 28 days to build a coalition with a parliamentary majority Likud, which controls 30 seats, blamed the prime minister's failure to form a coalition before the deadline ended at midnight on Mr Bennett's ""refusal to commit to a right-wing government"". Mr Netanyahu told his former protÃ©gÃ© and defence minister on Monday that he would be willing to hand over the premiership to him for one year. But Mr Bennett dismissed the proposal, saying that even with Yamina's support Mr Netanyahu would still be two seats short of a majority. The far-right Religious Zionism alliance had also ruled out joining a coalition supported by Raam, which was open to working with Mr Netanyahu to address the needs of Israel's Arab citizens. A long period of political stalemate in Israel has been complicated byMr Netanyahu's ongoing trial for corruption, which he denies. His rivals argue he should not remain in office while facing criminal charges. The 71-year-old is Israel's longest-serving leader, having led five governments since 1996. The last, which saw him share power with the then-main opposition party to help tackle the coronavirus pandemic, collapsed in December, triggering the latest election.

The story is accompanied by images from the award-winning illustrator Christian Robinson The story will be accompanied by images from the award-winning illustrator Christian Robinson. The duchess will also voice an audio version of her book. The publishers, Penguin Random House, said the book aimed to evoke ""a deep sense of warmth, connection, and compassion"". It added: ""It gives readers a window into shared and enduring moments between a diverse group of fathers and sons - moments of peace and reflection, trust and belief, discovery and learning, and lasting comfort."" The book is the latest in a number of ventures the Sussexes have taken up since their decision to step away from royal duties in 2020 to move to the US and pursue an independent life. The couple have since launched their own charitable foundation, Archewell, and the duchess voiced the Disney nature film, Elephant. Archewell inspired them to begin a podcast of the same name in which they aim to foster wellbeing and kindness. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have recently signed deals with Netflix and Spotify They have also secured commercial contracts thought to be worth millions, including a Netflix deal to produce TV projects and a Spotify deal for podcasts. Their first project for Netflix will focus on the Invictus Games, a competition for injured military personnel and veterans that was championed by the prince. He also recently announced he was joining mental health and life coaching start-up BetterUp as a ""chief impact officer"". The duchess's book is not her first venture into writing. She used to write a lifestyle blog called The Tig - which shut down after she began her relationship with Prince Harry. Archie turns two on Thursday and the couple are expecting their second child, a girl, later this year. Follow us onFacebook,externalor on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external.

"A resignation note left by a cleaner for her boss has gone viral on Twitter, with people speaking out against the poor treatment of support staff. Julie Cousins walked out of her job as a cleaner for HSBC last Friday after 35 years, according to her son Joe. In her note, the 67-year-old wrote that she was leaving due to being ""dressed down"" in the office by a manager. HSBC told the BBC it could not comment on individual personnel issues but was working to understand what happened. Ms Cousins, from Southampton, wrote in the note that the treatment she experienced was ""nothing more than aggressive and cruel"". ""So going forward, please all of you remember - in a world when you can be anything, be kind, because you are all no better than the cleaner."" Allow Twitter content?

"The signed picture from Mark Hamill to Dave Prowse was one of the standout items at the auction A rehearsal script for the classic film, The Empire Strikes Back, has sold for Â£23,000 at auction. The script for the 1980 Star Wars film was part of a collection of memorabilia belonging to Darth Vader actor Dave Prowse. Part of the proceeds of the auction, which raised more than Â£400,000, will go to Alzheimer's research. Prowsedied in Novemberafter a short illness but had been living with Alzheimer's for about 10 years. Auctioneer Andrew Stowe said more than 2,000 bidders had competed for the 600 lots which went under the hammer at East Bristol Auctions on 4 May -known as Star Wars Day. Prowse, a former professional bodybuilder,grew up on the Southmead estate in Bristol. Mr Stowe said the script was not just movie memorabilia but ""part of world history"". Prowse's script for The Empire Strikes Back A picture of Star Wars character Luke Skywalker, signed by Mark Hamill, the actor who played him, sold for Â£15,000. The message on the Luke Skywalker pictured read ""For David - You'll Always Be 'Dad' Vader To Me, Your Loving Son.... Mark Hamill 07"". A Darth Vader helmet given to Prowse by a fan was part of the auction A Star Wars cast list sold for Â£10,000 and a replica lightsaber also went for Â£10,000. Also in the sale was a photograph with a personal message from Carrie Fisher, who played Princess Leia. Lucas remembers ""imposing"" Prowse ""He was enormous"" The message on the photograph, which sold for Â£8,000, read: ""For Daddy Dave - My Preferred Father - Much Love, Carrie Fisher."" Mr Stowe said: ""The love for Star Wars is still as strong as it was back in 1977 - and today's auction was proof of that. ""The fact that Mr Prowse was born just a few miles away from our saleroom is what made this such a special event. It really felt like his collection 'came home'."" Dave Prowse played Darth Vader in the original three Star Wars films Overall the auction generated more than Â£400,000 The picture signed by Carrie Fisher was one of the most expensive sales at the auction Prowse's friend and assistant Julian Owen took about two months to sort through the items at the actor's London home. He said it had been ""an honour"" to organise them, after working with Prowse for more than a decade. Mr Owen said Prowse's wife Norma had ""said from the start that she wanted some of the money raised to go to Alzheimer's Research UK"".

"This video can not be played Emergency crews attended the collapse late on Monday near the Olivos station on the metro's 12 Line Mexican authorities have promised a full investigation into the collapse of a metro overpass in Mexico City, as questions mount over the line's safety. President AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador said ""nothing would be hidden"" while the mayor said an external company would be involved in the inquiry. The elevated track on Line 12 fell on to a road, killing at least 24 people. Concerns over possible structural failures had been raised since the line was inaugurated, in 2012. There were concerns about design problems and construction standards, as well as allegations of corruption. In pictures: Shock, grief, anger in Mexico over metro crash 'We heard a loud thunder and everything fell apart' At a news conference, President LÃ³pez Obrador said the investigation, to be carried out by federal and Mexico City prosecutors, should be done quickly. ""We cannot get into speculation, much less blame the possible perpetrators without having proof,"" he said. The line was built when Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard, a close ally of the president, was mayor of the capital. Speaking alongside the president, Mr Ebrard said it was a ""very sad day for everyone"". Current Mayor Claudia Sheinbaum also said it was too soon to say who was responsible for what happened. Earlier, she said it appeared a girder had given way on the overpass. The line will remain closed while a structural survey is carried out. Images show the site of the incident now and in 2019 CCTV footage showed the overpass collapsing as a train was travelling over it, sending up clouds of debris and sparks. The crash happened near the Olivos station, in the south-east of the city, on Monday night. Fernando Espino, secretary-general of the union representing metro workers, said the incident was related to a construction problem. ""This is a structural failure... We don't know if it's related to the material with which this [section] was built. We need to see what happened,"" he said, according to El Universal newspaper. Elevated parts of the line, including the collapsed overpass, had to be closed for multiple repairs in 2014. Residents also reported cracks in the structure after an earthquake in 2017, and transport authorities made repairs following the reports. In 2017, the then director of the city's metro, Jorge GaviÃ±o, said the line ""was born with endemic problems that would never be solved in its life"" and that it would require ""permanent"" maintenance. Cranes were deployed to stabilise and remove the train carriages from the structure The overpass collapsed as a train was travelling over it On Tuesday, cranes were deployed to stabilise and remove the two train carriages that remained hanging from the structure. ""We never had much faith in this metro [line],"" 62-year-old Maria Concepcion, who heard the collapse from her house, told Reuters news agency. CCICSA, one of the firms involved in the construction of the line, said in a statement to Reuters it was ""going to wait for the official expert opinion"". French train maker Alstom said it was willing to ""co-operate with and to aid authorities responsible for investigations in any way necessary"". At least 79 people were injured, including one person who had been pulled out alive from a car underneath the wreckage. The mayor said the dead included children, but she did not give details. Mexico City's metro system is one of the most used in the world, carrying tens of millions of passengers a week. In North America, only New York's subway carries more people every day. Yet the incident did not occur on one of the older lines, which have been through at least two major earthquakes in the past 35 years. Rather it happened on Line 12, completed as recently as October 2012. There will be difficult questions for the mayor's office to come about the construction of the line, including for several former mayors. This is the deadliest incident in decades for the city's metro system. In 1975, two underground trains collided, killing 31 people. Last year,one person was killedand more than 40 injured in a collision between two metro trains elsewhere in Mexico City. Were you in the area? Did you witness what happened?

"Politicians are visiting constituencies around Wales ahead of Thursday's vote Parties are focusing their campaigning on key north Wales battlegrounds with just two days to go before the Welsh Parliament election. Labour's Sir Keir Starmer visited Vale of Clwyd, Delyn and Wrexham, constituencies that the Tories gained from Labour at Westminster in 2019. Welsh Conservatives' Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies and Plaid's Liz Saville Roberts are also in the north. The Welsh Liberal Democrats are in Ceredigion. SIGN UP FOR WALES ALERTS:Get extra updates on BBC election coverage Sir Keir visited a military equipment manufacturer in St Asaph in the Vale of Clwyd constituency - a seat held by Labour at Senedd level but by the Conservatives in Westminster. It was one of six seats the Conservatives won from Labour at the Westminster election two years ago. Sir Keir said it was his ""job"" to ""rebuild trust"" after the party ""lost very badly in December 2019"". Sir Keir Starmer visited Excelitas Technologies in St Asaph, Vale of Clwyd Speaking to BBC Wales he asked voters to ""reflect"" on Welsh Labour's Mark Drakeford ""and the way he has led Wales over the last 14 months during this pandemic"". ""Very many people recognise that careful, reassuring way in which he has led Wales."" As it happened: Final week of the campaign He said he and Mr Drakeford both wanted ""more power and responsibility in Wales, decisions closer to people in Wales, a strong Wales in a fair United Kingdom"". Asked whether he would be happy if Labour worked with Plaid after the election, he added: ""What we're fighting for is a Labour-led Welsh government to continue the good work that has been done through the pandemic and lead us through the recovery."" In the three seats Sir Keir Starmer is visiting today, Labour is defending majorities that are smaller than the number of votes polled by UKIP at the last Welsh parliament election five years ago. Thebiggest study of its kindsuggests the vast majority of 2016 UKIP voters went to the Conservatives at the general elections of 2017 and 2019. If those people vote Tory again they could really help Andrew RT Davies. I spoke to an experienced Labour politician in this part of the world who has been out on the doors during the shortened campaign. She sounded confident Labour's vote was holding up. But that may not tell you much about what is happening on the other side of the spectrum, where the Conservatives are trying to convince people to keep up the habit of voting Tory. The incumbent first minister Mark Drakeford, meanwhile, has spent Tuesday visiting the constituencies of Rhondda, Llanelli and Bridgend. Bridgend is held by the Conservatives in Westminster but Labour in the Senedd, while Plaid Cymru is hoping to capture Llanelli from Labour. Plaid holds Rhondda - which Labour is campaigning to win back. While campaign director Ms Saville Roberts was campaigning in Aberconwy in the north, Plaid leader Adam Price was campaigning in Neath, a seat held by Labour in Cardiff Bay since devolution in 1999 and for more than a century at Westminster. He claimed voters - ""particularly traditional Labour voters"" - were ""saying they're coming over to Plaid because they feel it's time to give someone else a chance to take Wales in that new direction with new ideas and new leadership that puts us on a different path"". His party, said Mr Price, would ""deliver opportunity for our young people, dignity for old people and give everyone in Wales the chance for a better life"". ""People are really inspired, I think, by our positive message of hope and change and belief in Wales, there's no problem in Wales that Wales cannot solve."" WALES ELECTION: THE BASICS What's happening?On 6 May, people will vote to elect 60 Members of the Senedd (MSs). The party that can command the support of a majority of MSs will form the Welsh government.Find out more here. What powers does the Senedd have?MSs pass laws on aspects of life in Wales such as health, education and transport - and have some tax powers. Welsh Conservative Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies was campaigning in the Aberconwy constituency - a target for Plaid Cymru in north Wales. The Tories hold the seat, but held only a 754-vote majority over Plaid in the 2016 Senedd election. Mr Davies said north Wales ""has been too often ignored by Labour"". ""We have a clear plan to tackle our creaking infrastructure and fragile economy, and create jobs, prosperity and opportunity for people across Wales,"" he said. Adam Price campaigned in Neath on Tuesday Welsh Liberal Democrat leader Jane Dodds was in Ceredigion on Tuesday. ""The last year has brought into sharp focus the significant challenges in our rural economy,"" she said. ""From poor digital and transport connectivity, housing costs, and the challenges of running small businesses, rural Wales faces a difficult period ahead. ""Welsh Liberal Democrats are fighting this election with pledges to invest in tackling broadband and mobile phone connectivity to help both businesses and those choosing to work remotely."" Janet-Finch Saunders and Andrew RT Davies were canvassing in Penrhyn Bay The leader of the Abolish the Welsh Assembly Party (ATWAP) said voters were telling the party ""we need UK support, not more and more devolution"". Richard Suchorzewski, leader of ATWAP, said: ""This week speaking to businesses in north Wales, I have heard how their prospects have been hit by the Welsh Assembly with low investment, poor transport infrastructure and less Covid financial support than England. ""In the valleys, where Abolish received the support of Nigel Copner, who almost won Blaenau Gwent for Plaid Cymru last time, people are telling us we need UK support, not more and more devolution."" Reform UK accused Welsh Labour of ""dithering and delaying"" in easing Covid restrictions. ""Wales is paying the costs,"" said Reform's James Wells. ""Each day the cost of keeping business from fully reopening grows with a total bill from furlough alone around Â£2bn in Wales. Job losses are also contributing to the growing mental health crisis. This simply isn't good enough."" The Wales Green Party asked Labour voters not to place a ""wasted vote"" for the party on the regional list. The party said over the next couple of days Amelia Womack would be campaigning in Newport and surrounding areas, while Anthony Slaughter would be between Barry, Penarth and Cardiff. Mr Slaughter said a ""big priority for us is explaining to traditional Labour voters that Labour is a wasted vote on the regional list"", adding: ""It makes sense for Labour voters to lend their vote Green on the regional list."" UKIP Wales leader Neil Hamilton was campaigning in Merthyr Tydfil on Tuesday. A spokesman said the party was ""standing on a platform of decency, honesty and fairness"". ""Twenty-two years of Labour government has devastated Wales and left behind communities in the south Wales valleys and north Wales,"" the spokesman added. UKIP won seven seats at the last Welsh Assembly election in 2016. After a series of defections Mr Hamilton remained the only UKIP Senedd member in the last term.

"This video can not be played Rachel urged people to cherish every second of life, and not to ""rush back into things"" as restrictions ease A 46-year-old father of three children who died with Covid was ""the kindest, most caring human being"", his wife has said. Eric Ohene-Adjei had been treated for the virus at Cardiff's University Hospital of Wales for seven weeks. His wife Rachel said it showed people still needed to respect the dangers posed by the illness. She urged everyone: ""Don't take life for granted. Cherish every second you've got."" Rachel said their three children, Isaac, 12, Jacob, nine, and Ebony, eight, had been asking for their father ""every day"". She said she had been comforted by a stream of tributes to her husband, who worked at a Tesco supermarket in the city. ""I've had private messages on social media, with people telling me stories how they met Eric and what he meant to them,"" said his wife. ""It has given me comfort to know he gave to other people, what he gave to us as a family. "" She praised the care he had received in hospital, but described it as ""seven weeks of torture"". Eric died on 17 April, after his wife was told to return to his intensive care ward as it was ""not looking good"". Eric's children asked about their father while he was in hospital ""every day"" ""The doctors were amazing. They let me stay as long as I wanted,"" said Rachel. ""It was horrendous, but I'm honoured I got to say goodbye to him because there's loads of families that didn't get that opportunity. ""He wasn't on his own, and I got to hold him and tell him how much we all loved him and missed him and that we were going to be OK."" Rachel said there had been ""amazing"" support for her husband, who was born in Ghana, in West Africa. ""The primary school that my two youngest go to held a 'joys of Ghana day' last Friday,"" said Rachel. ""Everyone wore the Ghana colours. They learned all about Ghana and it was all in memory of their dad. ""That was amazing, the support we've had off everyone has been phenomenal."" Covid: What the stats tell us in Wales How many people have been vaccinated? Wales' Covid rules But she said it also reminded her that as more Covid restrictions are eased in Wales, people must remain aware of the dangers the virus still poses.

Please wear your facemasks, keep your 2m distance and don't take life for granted."" Eric's funeral will take place on Friday and Rachel said it would be a ""celebration"" of his life.

"The five leaders of Scotland's larger parties went head-to-head in the final TV debate of the Holyrood election campaign Nicola Sturgeon (SNP); Douglas Ross (Scottish Conservatives); Anas Sarwar (Scottish Labour); Patrick Harvie (Scottish Greens) and Willie Rennie (Scottish Lib Dems) took part Programme host Glenn Campbell questioned the panel on whether Scots should be allowed to go abroad this summer and what their plans for improving social care are Income tax and Scotland's constitutional future were also are at the heart of the live debate Earlier, BBC Scotland's The Campaign programme interviewed representatives of six smaller parties contesting the election It included Alex Salmond of Alba, All for Unityâs George Galloway; Reform UK Scotland's Michelle Ballantyne and UKIP Scotlandâs Donald Mackay The views of Richard Lucas of the Scottish Family Party and Carol Dobson of Freedom Alliance were also aired BBC Scotland News The leaders of the five larger parties faced off for the final time ahead of the Scottish Parliament election on 6 May. Here are the key points from the debate: Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent Tonight
we got a real flavour of whatâs at stake on Thursday. There are big devolved
issues which the next Parliament will decide on; health, income tax, social
care. There are more still there wasnât time for tonight. We
saw some of the caution thatâs likely when it comes to pandemic easing; many of
the parties urged exactly that when it comes to international travel starting
up again. And
yes, the issue that transcends so much in Scottish politics: independence. We
saw pressure on Nicola Sturgeon on the specifics (a detailed case will come
nearer the time of a referendum she says). On Douglas Ross on how Scots can
secure another referendum if they want one (heâs fighting to stop one he says).
On Anas Sarwar over whether heâll accept the will of the next Holyrood
parliament (a hint heâll oppose indyref2 whatever the result). Thereâs
a lot for voters to weigh up in the next 48 hours. If you're unsure which parties are standing in your constituency and who the candidates are, don't worry - help is at hand. Follow this linkand enter your postcode to see a full list. Author and independence campaigner Lesley Riddoch Broadcaster, author and independence campaigner Lesley Riddoch says none of the other parties really demonstrated why Nicola Sturgeon should not be the dominant force in Holyrood. Ms Riddoch says it is ""extraordinary"" that the towel has been so roundly thrown in by the other party leaders, who are all vying for second place. She argues Anas Sarwar has rehearsed his quips so well that he ""seems to win the day"" in the debate, but Labour are still lagging behind the Tories in the polls. Ms Riddoch says the ""stern, unyielding"" Conservative leader Douglas Ross seems to be more like what people want to stand up to Ms Sturgeon, despite Mr Sarwar coming across as more personable. Political commentator Andy McIver Political commentator Andy McIver does not think tonight's debate will decide whether SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon gets a majority. The former head of communications for the Scottish Conservatives says that question is ""real knife edge stuff"" and will be decided by what happens in a variety of constituencies or regions. ""I'm not sure tonight will have changed much."" However, Mr McIver says Ms Sturgeon softened some of the edges around the independence argument, making it quite clear she was strongly against a wildcat referendum. He says it's quite clear in his view that there will not be an indyref2 before 2023. Professor Sir John CurticeProfessor of Politics at Strathclyde University I would give Anas Sarwar the
prize again this evening for being the master of the quip â he has demonstrated that throughout these debates. But I'm not sure anyoneâs minds
would have been changed by what they heard tonight. If somebody were to land from Mars tomorrow and was given a vote in the Scottish election and was wondering what to do, the debate neatly illustrated the principal themes and difficulties behind this election: whether we should be having a referendum on independence or not, and, within that, questions about the substance of independence - where the SNP begin to struggle - and
then Brexit, where the Conservatives
begin to struggle. There is still a
secondary division within Scottish politics - whether you want a bigger or smaller state, whether you want more or less taxation. These are themes which we are all familiar with, but which have been largely absent in the campaign. But the programme illustrated there is a difference between a Tory and a Socialist, even
if on the question of independence, that division has been largely hidden from
view. The debate drew to a close on a consensual note about the desire to see family when the Covid-19 restrictions are limited. BBC Scotland political correspondent Philip Sim says all the parties have a lot in common when you look beyond the ""constitutional rammy"". Allow Twitter content?

The final question for the leaders is: What are you most looking forward to doing when the Covid
restrictions have been lifted? SNP leader Nicola Sturgeonsays hugging her
mum, dad and âwee sisterâ is what she wants to do more than anything. The
first minister says she wants to see businesses being able to trade
properly and for people to be able to go about their daily lives again, but
believes that for most people it is âthat family connectionâ they have missed the
most. Scottish Lib Dem leader Willie Renniesays heâs looking forward to sitting down with
his parents and enjoying an evening meal with his sister and grandchildren. âSelfishlyâ, he also wants to take part in âa masochistic hill race somewhereâ. As consensus breaks out, family is also at the core of the answer fromScottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar. ""I've not hugged my granny for over a year, I've not seen my
dad for well over a year,"" he says, adding that he is desperate to
see his loved ones, as everybody across the country is. Scottish Green co-leader Patrick Harviesays
the last time he was in the building hosting tonight's debate was for a beer
festival, and if he got the chance to go to another one he would be âin
absolute heavenâ. âIf I know my mum and dad well enough, they
would be there with me and it would be an increasingly huggy experience the
more sampling we did,â he added. Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Rossis also looking forward to spending more time
with family and hugging his parents, who have been unable to come into his
house despite living nearby. He and his wife are also expecting their second child next
month - and heâs hoping his family will be able to visit the newborn in hospital. Reality Check Douglas Ross says there are ""1.1 million people in Scotland who are taxed more for doing the same job than the rest of the UK"" The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) has crunched the numbers on this one. The key differences are the 19% and 21% rates either side of the basic 20% rate, as well as the extra percentage point on the higher rate and top rates of tax. The IFS said that 888,000 people would pay the 21% rate, 322,000 would pay 41% and 15,000 would pay 46%. That's a total of 1.2 million people paying more, which includes those people who are pulled into paying higher rates of tax because the threshold for them is lower in Scotland than it is in the rest of the UK. The IFS also says that taxpayers with incomes below Â£27,393 will pay less tax than they would in the rest of the UK. 
That's just over half of Scottish taxpayers. But the difference is small - no more than Â£20.97 this year. Turning to the constitution,Douglas Rossis asked about a Conservative tweet which said
an SNP majority was a guarantee of another independence referendum. The Scottish Conservative leader claimsNicola Sturgeonwould go ahead with an illegal
âwildcatâ referendum, taking her âeye off the ballâ when it comes to Covid
recovery. Mr Ross says the prime minister would turn down a request
for a referendum because the priority should be rebuilding after the pandemic. Ms Sturgeon insists she will not hold an âillegal
wildcat referendumâ if the SNP win a majority, saying she would ânot
countenance an illegal referendum, not least because it would not deliver
independenceâ. The SNP leader says she will be responsible and build and
ultimately win the case for independence through âpatient persuasion of people
across the countryâ. Scottish Labour leaderAnas Sarwarsays
the Conservativesâ approach on the constitution is âa gift to the SNPâ and
claims Douglas Ross is âonly interested in saving his skin, not saving the
unionâ. Mr Sarwar says he does not support a
referendum or independence and wants people to choose âsomething differentâ on
Thursday because the first minister cannot lead a referendum campaign and the
recovery at the same time. Willie Renniesays he doesnât want this to be the argument
for the next five years, because the people waiting an age for mental health
treatment or who are desperate for a job âdeserve better than thisâ. The Scottish Lib Dem leader says a nationalist majority will
lead to more arguments and a vote for his party will allow the focus to be on
the recovery. Patrick Harviedisagrees and insists the people of Scotland
must be asked if we are best placed to achieve a fairer and more equal society
and tackle climate change âas part of Boris Johnsonâs Brexit Britainâ. A small independent country would be better placed to tackle
the âincredible challengesâ Scotland faces, adds the Scottish Green co-leader. Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent This debate is a reminder
that there are big issues at stake on Thursday â not just the constitution and
independence. Many people will have the pandemic recovery on their mind â weâve
had hints tonight that Scotland could move slower than England when it comes to
international travel. Itâs also a reminder that the Scottish Parliament
controls how much income tax people pay in Scotland. The parties arenât
looking at changes - apart from the Conservatives, who think Scotland should be
brought back into line with UK rates. This is an election about devolved powers
â as well as whether Scotland should have more through independence. Glenn Campbell says there have been reports that  Boris Johnson will announce a new Royal Yacht, costing Â£200m, that will be named HMS Prince Philip. He asks the politicians if they are in favour. Patrick Harviesays prioritising a new Royal Yacht is âan
absurdityâ at a time when families are relying on foodbanks âbeggars
beliefâ. The Green co-leader says: âIâm not sure I can find a polite, broadcastable word to
describe the arrogance of that."" Willie Renniesays he can âprobably think of 500 other
thingsâ to spend Â£200m on and it is a âludicrous idea which will never happenâ. The Scottish Liberal Democrat leader labels it as one of Boris Johnsonâs âtricksâ to try to attract
attention. Nicola Sturgeonsays this is a"" ludicrous idea"" and
the only reason the prime minister is talking about this is to try and distract
attention from the ""sleaze that is swirling around him and his
government"". The SNP leader adds: âIt is another reason why Boris
Johnson should not be the guy who is making decisions about Scotland."" Anas Sarwarsays
the idea is âclearly a cheap stuntâ, which is âall the Conservatives have
leftâ. The Scottish Labour leader says if there is Â£200m going, âletâs put that into businesses, to
keep them going and keep people in jobsâ. Douglas Rosssays he
understands private investment would be sought to build such a yacht. The  Scottish Conservative leader says he would wait and see what private money was available
before making up his mind â but he wouldnât support public money being used for
the project. In a change of pace, the party leaders are asked to put their hands up if they have no fixed plans to increase income tax. Douglas Ross, Anas Sarwar, Nicola Sturgeon and Willie Rennie raise their hands, while Patrick Harvie says his party takes the view that this is not the time to do it. Nicola Sturgeonsays the issue is ""more complicated"" than hands up or hands down, and asks ""can we not have a proper debate?""  She says that given the economy will be recovering from the Covid
pandemic, tax stability really matters and states: âWe have no plans to raise
tax in the next parliamentâ. The SNP leader says that based on assumptions made about growth and tax revenues, the
SNPâs manifesto commitments can be funded - and that it is important to invest for the future and the transition to net-zero carbon
emissions. Douglas Rossattacks the SNP, claiming its manifesto is
âuncostedâ and that it isnât being âhonestâ with the public. He says the priority is Covid recovery, but by the end of the
parliament he would like to see parity in the tax system. The Scottish Conservative leader says 1.1 million people in
Scotland are paying more tax than they would if they lived south of the border. Anas Sarwarsays Douglas Ross would rather give
himself a tax-cut, rather than people across the country, and says Labour do
want to raise tax by taxing online giants like Amazon. The Scottish Labour leader says he still
supports the principle of a more progressive tax system. However, the
presumption would be to not increase income taxes through the course of the
recovery and thereafter raise income tax on those earning more than Â£150,000. Willie Renniesays his party have an âaspirationâ towards
a universal basic income but the priority for the next parliament will be to
put the recovery from Covid first and invest in more mental health services and
3,500 more teachers, as well as a youth jobs guarantee. The Scottish Liberal Democrat leader insists this could
all be done within the medium term financial strategy already set out by the
Scottish government. Patrick Harviesays most people recognise that the recovery
phase from Covid is a chance to create a fairer and greener Scotland. The Greens' co-leader says the focus shouldnât just be on income tax â he wants
a reform of council tax to create a âfairer wealth taxâ. He says all the main political parties have agreed there
needs to be a deep look at all aspects to taxation not just to create
investment, but also a fairer distribution of wealth. Andrew KerrScottish political correspondent Itâs the big issue that affects all of us or our families - how we provide care.

Thereâs a real divergence with the parties here.  Three out of the five support a new National Care Service. Itâs a key part of the SNP manifesto - and Nicola Sturgeon said the pandemic shone a light into the system. Questioned why a global pandemic had forced the issue, Ms Sturgeon said a number of reforms had been put in place already but wanted now to see consistent, national standards moving to a structure of ownership not based on profit. The national care service is also backed by Labour - with Anas Sarwar saying he was being frank in pointing out it wouldnât be getting into public hands overnight. The Greensâ Patrick Harvie said that eventually there should be a non-profit and default public sector expectation.  Itâs fair to say they take the strongest line on this. Douglas Ross of the Conservatives questioned the criticism of private providers. The Tories are not convinced by a new national service as theyâre wary of unnecessary reform but he did say he would keep looking at the issue. The Liberal Democrats share that scepticism.  Willie Rennie said he didnât want to repeat the mistakes of the centralisation of the police - but invest in the skills and talent of staff.

He warned that a sticking-plaster approach didnât deal with the fundamental problems in the care service. Whatever approach is taken - the voters are watching - and worrying about the issue. The second question for the party leaders is on the subject of social care. Glenn Campbell asks what a national care service would do? Labour leader Anas Sarwarsays national standards
and a human rights approach much be applied to social care, along with more
investment in the workforce. He says it wonât be possible to get social care entirely
into public hands overnight â  there will have to be a âpartnership
between the public service, the voluntary sector and also the private sectorâ. Conservative leader Douglas Rosssays all the staff in the care sector must be
recognised as going âabove and beyondâ under some of the most difficult
circumstances. On pay, he says we must look at what care staff are asking
for and see what is achievable, as there is a âlooming economic crisisâ as we
come out of the pandemic. Scottish Greens
co-leader Patrick Harviesays his party agree on the need for an
increase in the carersâ allowance and the grant for unpaid carers. The issue
exposes the âhistoric under-valuing of care workâ which is âcritical to
peopleâs wellbeing"", and he believes the âdefaultâ expectation should be that
the public sector runs the care sector. SNP leader Nicola Sturgeonsays the pandemic has undoubtedly shone a
light on the strength of our care system, but also the fragilities of it. We must be bold about the legacy we want to see come out of
this pandemic, and a national care service should be one of these ambitions,
argues the SNP leader. Lib Dem leader Willie Renniesays his party is very wary about a national
care service as he does not want to repeat the mistakes of the centralisation
of the police. He says we need to invest in the
skills and talents of the staff in the sector and avoid a centralised service, as that would be a mistake. Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent The last few days of an election are about hammering home key messages. You can expect that tonight; each of the five leaders want to remind you of their central themes.
Itâs also about turnout, which could be more important than ever in this pandemic election. Can the SNP persuade their supporters to come out, giving them more of a chance of achieving the majority they want? You can expect to hear the other parties talk a lot about the regional ballot vote tonight; it will be crucial in the race for second place between the Conservatives and Labour, as well as for the fortunes of the Greens and Lib Dems. This has been a strange election. Political reporters like me have missed the big events, the public interactions that produce colour and the odd confrontation too. There hasnât been as much canvassing, no street stalls, no big rallies. That makes these televised debates even more important to the parties. One final chance to win you over. BBC Scotland political editor Glenn Campbell kicks off the leaders debate with his first question, on easing lockdown rules. He asks: Should people be able to go abroad on holiday from 17 May? Scottish Conservatives leader
Douglas Rosssays people are understandably still concerned about bringing the
virus back into the UK. He urges caution and says âletâs have staycations in Scotland, letâs look at
what we have on our own shoresâ. Scottish Greens co-leader Patrick Harvieworries that we might get back to the situation of last summer, when a second wave of cases occurred as a result of importation of new cases. He says that while the rest of the world is still waiting to vaccinated, the risk of importing new, potentially more dangerous, remains high, and international travel will have to be one of the last things to be lifted. SNP leader Nicola Sturgonsays a decision hasnât yet been
taken on foreign travel  - but it is one of the first decisions a first
minister will be taking next week. She says she wants to get international travel back to normal
as much as she want other aspects of our lives back to normal, but says it may have to wait âa
little bit longerâ. Anas Sarwar, the Scottish Labour leader, says in an ideal situation he would like to see a consistent approach across the UK, but adds we should not be afraid to do things differently in Scotland if that is the right thing to do. Mr Sarwar adds that the big frustration for the tourism and aviation industries has been the lack of communication, and he calls for them to be given a clear route map. Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Renniemaintains caution should be the watchword, with lessons learnt from the mistakes of last year, when travel restrictions were eased âtoo quicklyâ. We need consistency across the UK if possible, Mr Rennie adds, and need to recognise that other countries have not been as fast as the UK in rolling out a vaccine programme. Andrew KerrScottish political correspondent How cranky will the politicians be with each other in this leadersâ debate? Each of these set-piece events has had a different tone and feel to it.

The first BBC debate â away back at the beginning of the campaign â was quite calm. There was a new cast list â Douglas Ross from the Conservatives, Anas Sarwar from Labour and Lorna Slater from the Greens were on stage for the first time with their fellow performers. The SNPâs Nicola Sturgeon and Willie Rennie of the Liberal Democrats are old hands, having toured the halls and venues of Scotland with their leader debate shows. The new gang took a while to find their feet, with no audience â but it got a bit more lively towards the end. For the STV debate further into the campaign they loosened up a bit.  Allowed to question each other, they werenât shy in putting their points forward.  The new team had bonded. By the time it got to the Channel 4 debate last week, it felt as though they were pretty tired and fed-up of each other. It got cranky.

Douglas Ross and Nicola Sturgeon were arguing, while Anas Sarwar tried to join in from the sidelines.

It felt as if the pressures of the campaign were showing. Weâre nearer polling day now and the focus in this BBC debate will be on key messages.  It might return to being a little more restrained as the end is now in sight â or they might want to vent at each other.

Tune in to see. Alba leader Alex Salmond insists his party has helped
support for independence because they have put it âfront and centreâ of the
election campaign. Mr Salmond told BBC Scotland's The Campaign programme that his party had brought an ""injection of
vim and vigour"" which will ""hopefully"" be rewarded in Thursday's election. If the Scottish Parliament begin negotiations with Westminster over a second independence referendum immediately after the election, Scotland could be an independent country in a little over four years, Mr Salmond claimed. In the years before the first indyref, Mr Salmond said support for independence was only at around 28-30%, but there is a now a "" very substantial argument"" that support for independence is ""ahead of
the politicians"". Instead of wasting their vote, if even a quarter of SNP voters switch to Alba on the regional list, then there will be a barrowload of Alba MSPs elected this week."" Alex Salmond, Alba Party leader You can read more about theAlba Party's policies here. Michelle Ballantyne of Reform UK said her party understood that decisions should be taken close to the people, and that the devolved parliament in Scotland could be a positive thing. She said Reform UK's approach was ""fundamentally about common sense"". The party began its life as the Brexit party, and Ms Ballantyne was elected to Holyrood as a Conservative MSP in 2015. Reform UK's policies include scrapping the Curriculum for Excellence, opposition to further lockdowns and getting rid of a number of taxes with the aim of stimulating the economy. What we are concerned about is the move away from integrity and common sense, the move away from policies that have a positive difference, that improve our education system, that increase the benefits to health and address the issues we have in Scotland, such as our drugs problem.""

"Sir Jeffrey Donaldson and Edwin Poots are in the running for the DUP leadership The vote to elect the next leader of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) will take place on 14 May, the party has said. Party officers met on Tuesday to discuss the procedure and timetable for the election of both a new leader and deputy leader. Agriculture Minister Edwin Poots and MP Sir Jeffrey Donaldson are bidding to succeed Arlene Foster. She steps down as DUP leaderon 28 May and first minister at the end of June. It is the first time in the party's 50-year history that a leadership contest has taken place. An announcement on the next leader is expected by 17:00 BST on 14 May, the party said. The meeting, to be overseen by party chairman Lord Morrow, will be conducted virtually. The party said contenders for both leader and deputy leader must submit their expression of interest by 17:00 BST on 6 May. The current deputy leader of the party is Lord Dodds. Mr Pootsbegan his leadership bid last Thursday, while Sir Jeffreyannounced his bid on Monday, the 100th anniversary of the formation of Northern Ireland. In a statement on Tuesday evening, Lord Morrow said the date of 14 May was chosen to reflect the fact that Covid restrictions are due to be reviewed at a meeting of the NI Executive on 13 May, and that the Queen's speech will take place in Parliament on 12 May. He said DUP representatives will be required to attend both commitments. ""In accordance with the constitution and rules of the Democratic Unionist Party, only party members, who are also members of the Northern Ireland Assembly and the House of Commons, are entitled to vote for the leader or deputy leader."" There are 28 DUP MLAs (Members of the Legislative Assembly) and eight MPs. South Down DUP MLA Jim Wells, who lost the whip in 2018 after he criticised the party leadership in the media, told BBC News NI he had received the letter that went to all DUP MLAs and MPs on Tuesday evening, informing them about the process for the vote. He said he was ""delighted"" his vote would count and reiterated he would be supporting Mr Poots. Arlene Foster will step down as DUP leader on 28 May Several senior DUP Stormont assembly members and the MP Paul Girvan have declared their support for Mr Poots. Speaking in the Northern Ireland Assembly on Tuesday, the Lagan Valley MLA confirmed he had ""no desire"" to hold the position of first minister should he be elected DUP leader. It is understood he would want to remain agriculture minister. Sir Jeffrey, the MP for Lagan Valley, has the backing of MPs Gavin Robinson and Jim Shannon as well as Education Minister Peter Weir and Junior Minister Gordon Lyons. Campaigners for both contenders claim their candidate has significant support within the party ranks. Sitting in the Stormont chamber on Tuesday, Arlene Foster cut a lonely figure on the benches where she once ruled. She was socially and politically distant from previously loyal supporters who signed a letter of no confidence in her leadership last week, forcing her to quit. Apart for the odd polite smile to those opposite wishing her well for the future, she showed no emotion. First Minister Arlene Foster (in yellow jacket) in the assembly chamber on Tuesday As she exited the chamber, one of the men who wants to replace her as leader entered through another door. Unlike Mrs Foster, Edwin Poots shared the benches with those who have already expressed support for his leadership bid. The contrast was stark. In order to become party leader, a candidate must secure the support of at least 18 of the party's assembly members and MPs. Mrs Fosterannounced her decision to resignafter facing a revolt from DUP members last week. She had led the party since December 2015 and was appointed first minister of Northern Ireland the following month. DUP facing divisive leadership battle BBC News NI understands that she will sever her ties with the DUP when she stands down as first minister, with sources close to her saying she thinks it is no longer the party she joined.

"Sir Jeffrey Donaldson and Edwin Poots are in the running for the DUP leadership The vote to elect the next leader of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) will take place on 14 May, the party has said. Party officers met on Tuesday to discuss the procedure and timetable for the election of both a new leader and deputy leader. Agriculture Minister Edwin Poots and MP Sir Jeffrey Donaldson are bidding to succeed Arlene Foster. She steps down as DUP leaderon 28 May and first minister at the end of June. It is the first time in the party's 50-year history that a leadership contest has taken place. An announcement on the next leader is expected by 17:00 BST on 14 May, the party said. The meeting, to be overseen by party chairman Lord Morrow, will be conducted virtually. The party said contenders for both leader and deputy leader must submit their expression of interest by 17:00 BST on 6 May. The current deputy leader of the party is Lord Dodds. Mr Pootsbegan his leadership bid last Thursday, while Sir Jeffreyannounced his bid on Monday, the 100th anniversary of the formation of Northern Ireland. In a statement on Tuesday evening, Lord Morrow said the date of 14 May was chosen to reflect the fact that Covid restrictions are due to be reviewed at a meeting of the NI Executive on 13 May, and that the Queen's speech will take place in Parliament on 12 May. He said DUP representatives will be required to attend both commitments. ""In accordance with the constitution and rules of the Democratic Unionist Party, only party members, who are also members of the Northern Ireland Assembly and the House of Commons, are entitled to vote for the leader or deputy leader."" There are 28 DUP MLAs (Members of the Legislative Assembly) and eight MPs. South Down DUP MLA Jim Wells, who lost the whip in 2018 after he criticised the party leadership in the media, told BBC News NI he had received the letter that went to all DUP MLAs and MPs on Tuesday evening, informing them about the process for the vote. He said he was ""delighted"" his vote would count and reiterated he would be supporting Mr Poots. Arlene Foster will step down as DUP leader on 28 May Several senior DUP Stormont assembly members and the MP Paul Girvan have declared their support for Mr Poots. Speaking in the Northern Ireland Assembly on Tuesday, the Lagan Valley MLA confirmed he had ""no desire"" to hold the position of first minister should he be elected DUP leader. It is understood he would want to remain agriculture minister. Sir Jeffrey, the MP for Lagan Valley, has the backing of MPs Gavin Robinson and Jim Shannon as well as Education Minister Peter Weir and Junior Minister Gordon Lyons. Campaigners for both contenders claim their candidate has significant support within the party ranks. Sitting in the Stormont chamber on Tuesday, Arlene Foster cut a lonely figure on the benches where she once ruled. She was socially and politically distant from previously loyal supporters who signed a letter of no confidence in her leadership last week, forcing her to quit. Apart for the odd polite smile to those opposite wishing her well for the future, she showed no emotion. First Minister Arlene Foster (in yellow jacket) in the assembly chamber on Tuesday As she exited the chamber, one of the men who wants to replace her as leader entered through another door. Unlike Mrs Foster, Edwin Poots shared the benches with those who have already expressed support for his leadership bid. The contrast was stark. In order to become party leader, a candidate must secure the support of at least 18 of the party's assembly members and MPs. Mrs Fosterannounced her decision to resignafter facing a revolt from DUP members last week. She had led the party since December 2015 and was appointed first minister of Northern Ireland the following month. DUP facing divisive leadership battle BBC News NI understands that she will sever her ties with the DUP when she stands down as first minister, with sources close to her saying she thinks it is no longer the party she joined. Mrs Foster did not take part in a Tuesday morning meeting with her assembly team. The first minister was in the assembly chamber later as Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill responded to questions to the Executive Office.

"This video can not be played Emergency crews attended the collapse late on Monday near the Olivos station on the metro's 12 Line Mexican authorities have promised a full investigation into the collapse of a metro overpass in Mexico City, as questions mount over the line's safety. President AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador said ""nothing would be hidden"" while the mayor said an external company would be involved in the inquiry. The elevated track on Line 12 fell on to a road, killing at least 24 people. Concerns over possible structural failures had been raised since the line was inaugurated, in 2012. There were concerns about design problems and construction standards, as well as allegations of corruption. In pictures: Shock, grief, anger in Mexico over metro crash 'We heard a loud thunder and everything fell apart' At a news conference, President LÃ³pez Obrador said the investigation, to be carried out by federal and Mexico City prosecutors, should be done quickly. ""We cannot get into speculation, much less blame the possible perpetrators without having proof,"" he said. The line was built when Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard, a close ally of the president, was mayor of the capital. Speaking alongside the president, Mr Ebrard said it was a ""very sad day for everyone"". Current Mayor Claudia Sheinbaum also said it was too soon to say who was responsible for what happened. Earlier, she said it appeared a girder had given way on the overpass. The line will remain closed while a structural survey is carried out. Images show the site of the incident now and in 2019 CCTV footage showed the overpass collapsing as a train was travelling over it, sending up clouds of debris and sparks. The crash happened near the Olivos station, in the south-east of the city, on Monday night. Fernando Espino, secretary-general of the union representing metro workers, said the incident was related to a construction problem. ""This is a structural failure... We don't know if it's related to the material with which this [section] was built. We need to see what happened,"" he said, according to El Universal newspaper. Elevated parts of the line, including the collapsed overpass, had to be closed for multiple repairs in 2014. Residents also reported cracks in the structure after an earthquake in 2017, and transport authorities made repairs following the reports. In 2017, the then director of the city's metro, Jorge GaviÃ±o, said the line ""was born with endemic problems that would never be solved in its life"" and that it would require ""permanent"" maintenance. Cranes were deployed to stabilise and remove the train carriages from the structure The overpass collapsed as a train was travelling over it On Tuesday, cranes were deployed to stabilise and remove the two train carriages that remained hanging from the structure. ""We never had much faith in this metro [line],"" 62-year-old Maria Concepcion, who heard the collapse from her house, told Reuters news agency. CCICSA, one of the firms involved in the construction of the line, said in a statement to Reuters it was ""going to wait for the official expert opinion"". French train maker Alstom said it was willing to ""co-operate with and to aid authorities responsible for investigations in any way necessary"". At least 79 people were injured, including one person who had been pulled out alive from a car underneath the wreckage. The mayor said the dead included children, but she did not give details. Mexico City's metro system is one of the most used in the world, carrying tens of millions of passengers a week. In North America, only New York's subway carries more people every day. Yet the incident did not occur on one of the older lines, which have been through at least two major earthquakes in the past 35 years. Rather it happened on Line 12, completed as recently as October 2012. There will be difficult questions for the mayor's office to come about the construction of the line, including for several former mayors. This is the deadliest incident in decades for the city's metro system. In 1975, two underground trains collided, killing 31 people. Last year,one person was killedand more than 40 injured in a collision between two metro trains elsewhere in Mexico City. Were you in the area? Did you witness what happened?

"Abbie and AJ were trying to film a trick for social media when the accident happened Dancer Abbie Quinnen, who was badly burned when a social media stunt went wrong, says she has received ""horrible"" messages from trolls on Instagram since the accident in January. Quinnen and her partner, ex-Strictly star AJ Pritchard, were due to film a trick with highly-flammable liquid when a fireball ""shot across the room"". The 23-year-old suffered second and third degree burns across her body. One of the Instagram messages said: ""You should have burned to death."" Recounting the initial incident to Victoria Derbyshire on BBC Radio 2's Jeremy Vine Show, Quinnen said she immediately screamed for help as the liquid caught fire uncontrollably. ""I was in shock and thinking, how can I survive this?"" she said. ""I rolled on the floor and that didn't work, so I grabbed a heavy blanket and started trying to put out the flames that way. ""AJ was getting damp towels in the meantime."" Although it was over in seconds, she said ""it felt like a lifetime"" and she kept asking Pritchard, ""Is my face going to be okay? Am I going to be okay? Will you still love me?"" The dancer suffered second and third degree burns to her face, head, neck, ear, chest and down her right side; she also lost some of her hair. She has had three skin graft operations, two of which involved using someone else's skin - called an allograft. ""I could have been blinded. I could have lost my hearing. I'm so lucky. It could have been even worse,"" she said. At one point the dancer was having to take 27 tablets a day to cope with the pain. Quinnen said she has been helped by many people on Instagram who have shared their own experiences of being burned. But others have posted messages including: ""You should have burned to death""; ""You're now going to look like a waxwork model""; and ""Don't go near your niece and nephew, you'll scare them"". ""It's so horrible, I just think it's really sad and I feel a bit sorry for them,"" Quinnen said. One of the hardest things for her was thinking she would never look the same again. ""When I was in hospital, staff tried every day to persuade me to talk to a therapist, but I just didn't want to, I wasn't ready. Even looking at the reflection of my face in my 'phone screen was hideous,"" she said. When eventually spoke with a counsellor, they asked her to look into a mirror to help her accept what had happened to her. ""I was hysterical,"" she said. She credits Pritchard with helping her recover, but initially would get upset when he was going out to work on the Channel 4 soap opera, Hollyoaks. ""He was able to get on with his life whereas I was in bed struggling with the consequences. I wasn't thinking straight, I know he was trying to be strong for me. ""Then I caught AJ crying once and he was trying to say 'I'm sorry, I'm sorry'. I was shocked because he'd obviously been keeping it in for weeks."" Quinnen said she has cried every day since her accident in mid-January up until last week, but is now trying focus on her goal of being back on stage, performing alongside Pritchard and his brother Curtis in their autumn tour. She also wants to start a petition to get videos like the one she and her partner were trying to recreate removed from YouTube so no one else gets injured like her. She says she has asked ""Why did this happen to me?"" and is very anxious. ""I don't go out too much and I'm constantly thinking something else bad is going to happen."" Qunnen also paid tribute to the NHS medics who cared for her. ""They are the closest thing to superheroes. My surgeon was amazing - I trusted her with my life. And all the nurses are so amazing."" Doctors have told her they won't know for another two years how much scarring she will have on her face in the long-term. As to her future with Pritchard, she says they've talked about marriage and children. ""AJ has been incredible. By my side the whole time, feeding me and cleaning my wounds,"" she added. ""I would love to get married to AJ. He is my dream man. I can't imagine my life without him.""

"The signed picture from Mark Hamill to Dave Prowse was one of the standout items at the auction A rehearsal script for the classic film, The Empire Strikes Back, has sold for Â£23,000 at auction. The script for the 1980 Star Wars film was part of a collection of memorabilia belonging to Darth Vader actor Dave Prowse. Part of the proceeds of the auction, which raised more than Â£400,000, will go to Alzheimer's research. Prowsedied in Novemberafter a short illness but had been living with Alzheimer's for about 10 years. Auctioneer Andrew Stowe said more than 2,000 bidders had competed for the 600 lots which went under the hammer at East Bristol Auctions on 4 May -known as Star Wars Day. Prowse, a former professional bodybuilder,grew up on the Southmead estate in Bristol. Mr Stowe said the script was not just movie memorabilia but ""part of world history"". Prowse's script for The Empire Strikes Back A picture of Star Wars character Luke Skywalker, signed by Mark Hamill, the actor who played him, sold for Â£15,000. The message on the Luke Skywalker pictured read ""For David - You'll Always Be 'Dad' Vader To Me, Your Loving Son.... Mark Hamill 07"". A Darth Vader helmet given to Prowse by a fan was part of the auction A Star Wars cast list sold for Â£10,000 and a replica lightsaber also went for Â£10,000. Also in the sale was a photograph with a personal message from Carrie Fisher, who played Princess Leia. Lucas remembers ""imposing"" Prowse ""He was enormous"" The message on the photograph, which sold for Â£8,000, read: ""For Daddy Dave - My Preferred Father - Much Love, Carrie Fisher."" Mr Stowe said: ""The love for Star Wars is still as strong as it was back in 1977 - and today's auction was proof of that. ""The fact that Mr Prowse was born just a few miles away from our saleroom is what made this such a special event. It really felt like his collection 'came home'."" Dave Prowse played Darth Vader in the original three Star Wars films Overall the auction generated more than Â£400,000 The picture signed by Carrie Fisher was one of the most expensive sales at the auction Prowse's friend and assistant Julian Owen took about two months to sort through the items at the actor's London home. He said it had been ""an honour"" to organise them, after working with Prowse for more than a decade. Mr Owen said Prowse's wife Norma had ""said from the start that she wanted some of the money raised to go to Alzheimer's Research UK"".

"Care home residents in England can now go on low-risk trips - such as to relatives' gardens or a local park - without having to self-isolate for 14 days when they return. It comes after some families say they have felt ""powerless"" because of ""restrictive"" visits. One woman said her mother had not been outdoors for more than 12 months and it would be ""amazing"" to take her outside. Campaigners now want the rule change to become law, rather than just guidance. Care home isolation rule axed Two visitors for care home residents Can I hug my relative in a care home? The government brought about the change because a fall in Covid cases meant it was now ""much safer"" for care home residents to go outside. It had been threatened with legal action by the charity John's Campaign over the isolation requirement. The move, announced on Saturday, has now come into effect. On Tuesday, thegovernment's coronavirus dashboard,externalrecorded 1,946 new infections, as well as four deaths within 28 days of a positive test across the UK. The recorded number of deaths is often lower immediately after weekends and bank holidays due to reporting lags. More than 50 million Covid vaccinations have been given in the UK so far, with 34,667,904 first doses and 15,630,007 second doses. Jenny Morrison, co-founder of Rights for Residents - a group founded to end ""inhumane restrictions"" preventing relatives visiting loved ones in care homes - told BBC Breakfast the change would certainly make a difference for her family, saying: ""Mum's care home is near the seafront. On a nice sunny day, after 14 months where she hasn't been outside, it will be amazing for us to wheel mum down to the seafront and have a picnic. It will just be absolutely wonderful."" Jenny Morrison said it would be wonderful to take her mother outside But she said some care homes were ignoring the guidance, with some families being given good access for visits, either indoors or outside, but others not. She said family members needed to be seen not as ""just visitors"" but as ""essential components of people's care"". A petition has been delivered to the government, calling for the guidance on visits to be made legally binding. It also calls for relatives of care home residents to be given essential caregiver status by law, so they could continue to visit loved ones in case of another lockdown. David Finch, from Trowbridge, is hoping the care home where his wife Tricia, 74, lives will be implementing the changes. She has Alzheimer's and has been living at the care home since July 2020, yet her husband has never been inside. ""Trish hasn't seen her family properly since July,"" he said. ""The longer we go on with this separation, it's just deteriorating. I just need to be able to take her out, have a walk and feed the ducks. ""The trouble with the care home situation is because they're only guidelines, the care homes are frightened to death of implementing something that could cause them problems."" What do the new rulesfor Englandmean? Only trips deemed as low-risk - to places such as gardens or parks - are exempt from the isolation rule Residents will also be allowed to vote in person in the local elections on Thursday Residents must be accompanied by a member of staff or nominated visitor and they have to follow social distancing at all times They cannot meet in groups or go indoors - apart from to use toilets - and public transport should be avoided Overnight trips are not allowed and residents will have to self-isolate after attending medical appointments There are different rules in the UK's devolved nations, with residents in Wales able to leave homes where there is no Covid outbreak, without isolating on their return Scotland's guidance for care homes allows for residents to see loved ones outside of the care home, while rules for care homes in Northern Ireland vary by region Care home residents in England have been allowed one regular visitor since 8 March, in the first easing of lockdown. The daughter of another care-home resident spoke to BBC Radio 4's Today programme about the change in guidance. Wendy, from Essex, said: ""It's just been so tough. I feel like we've been forgotten and the families just feel so powerless. The visits have been so restrictive. ""It's been so difficult trying to have a simple conversation with my father through a screen."" She said the visits in care-home pods or gardens were only 20 minutes long, with both people wearing masks. ""They can't hear you, you can't hear them, you're watched as well - there's no privacy,"" she said. Wendy added that, as the only visitor allowed, ""You have this terrible responsibility to try to keep memories of everyone else alive."" Margaret, from Colchester, also in Essex, says her mother, who lives in a care home, no longer recognises her. She says her mother's age and frailty mean that meeting outside is not an option. She questions why she cannot have a ""meaningful visit"" sitting next to her mother inside the care home. ""I want to go and sit next to my mother and look her straight in the eye and say 'hello, I'm Margaret.'"" A blowy, rainy day in many areas means even though family and friends can now take care home residents for a walk in the park or to visit their garden, few are likely to venture out. And as the guidance was only published on Saturday, homes have had little chance to put in place risk assessments and any staff support required. Still, it is an important step forward for families who have become increasingly angry about the restrictions faced by residents of all ages as the rest of society opens up. Even when guidance is updated, some homes have chosen not to loosen restrictions. It is one of the reasons campaigners are presenting a petition to the prime minister today calling for one named relative or friend to be legally recognised as part of each resident's essential care team, so allowing them access to care homes whatever is happening. Janet Shepherd from Utterby, Lincolnshire, says the new guidance means her partner could visit their garden, but added: ""He's got dementia and coming-home trips would have to be on a progressive scale because it makes them anxious. ""I would like to spend more time with him during the day, seeing what he does and getting involved. Going for walks and taking picnics round and maybe taking a car trip. Coming home after such a long time might be too much for him."" Some have said there is not enough discretion for younger care home residents and there needs to be more easing of restrictions for them. Maggie Lyons, from Sheffield, said her 42-year-old son, who lives in a specialist care home for men with autism, is ""desperate to have some kind of life"". ""We, his parents, can't have him to our home for an overnight stay,"" she said. ""Young people in care homes are basically incarcerated. ""When my other children can visit me on 17 May he might not be able to. Yes, I can take him to a park or sit in the garden but that isn't what he wants to do."" GLOBAL SPREAD:How many worldwide cases are there? VACCINE:When will I get the jab? NEW VARIANTS:How worried should we be? QUARANTINE:Will I need to self-isolate in a hotel? Anna Knight, chair of the Dorset Care Homes Association and manager of Harbour House Care Home in Bridport, said: ""You can imagine how it would make you feel if you were completely imprisoned, as it were, in your home."" She said it had not just been difficult for residents but for families and staff members as well, adding: ""Everybody has really struggled."" This video can not be played Ruthie Henshall on care home visits: ""It is beautiful to see the joy in her"" Ms Knight said her care home was now putting plans in place to allow visits outside the home to happen. ""It's going to be fantastic,"" she told Today. ""I know the families are already excited."" She said the previous guidance had been ""sensible"" but now was the time to start ""learning to live with this"". Mike Padgham, who runs four care homes in North Yorkshire and is chair of the Independent Care Group, said the move represented limited progress. ""It's great news, but personally I think it could have come a bit sooner because people have not been able to have their freedom in care homes for well over a year,"" he said. He added there had not been enough notice given, saying: ""The public want to make arrangements and we're not quite geared up for it yet,"" he added. The government is expected to review the self-isolation requirement for other visits when it reaches the next stage of the road map for easing coronavirus restrictions.

"Abbie and AJ were trying to film a trick for social media when the accident happened Dancer Abbie Quinnen, who was badly burned when a social media stunt went wrong, says she has received ""horrible"" messages from trolls on Instagram since the accident in January. Quinnen and her partner, ex-Strictly star AJ Pritchard, were due to film a trick with highly-flammable liquid when a fireball ""shot across the room"". The 23-year-old suffered second and third degree burns across her body. One of the Instagram messages said: ""You should have burned to death."" Recounting the initial incident to Victoria Derbyshire on BBC Radio 2's Jeremy Vine Show, Quinnen said she immediately screamed for help as the liquid caught fire uncontrollably. ""I was in shock and thinking, how can I survive this?"" she said. ""I rolled on the floor and that didn't work, so I grabbed a heavy blanket and started trying to put out the flames that way. ""AJ was getting damp towels in the meantime."" Although it was over in seconds, she said ""it felt like a lifetime"" and she kept asking Pritchard, ""Is my face going to be okay? Am I going to be okay? Will you still love me?"" The dancer suffered second and third degree burns to her face, head, neck, ear, chest and down her right side; she also lost some of her hair. She has had three skin graft operations, two of which involved using someone else's skin - called an allograft. ""I could have been blinded. I could have lost my hearing. I'm so lucky. It could have been even worse,"" she said. At one point the dancer was having to take 27 tablets a day to cope with the pain. Quinnen said she has been helped by many people on Instagram who have shared their own experiences of being burned. But others have posted messages including: ""You should have burned to death""; ""You're now going to look like a waxwork model""; and ""Don't go near your niece and nephew, you'll scare them"". ""It's so horrible, I just think it's really sad and I feel a bit sorry for them,"" Quinnen said. One of the hardest things for her was thinking she would never look the same again. ""When I was in hospital, staff tried every day to persuade me to talk to a therapist, but I just didn't want to, I wasn't ready. Even looking at the reflection of my face in my 'phone screen was hideous,"" she said. When eventually spoke with a counsellor, they asked her to look into a mirror to help her accept what had happened to her. ""I was hysterical,"" she said. She credits Pritchard with helping her recover, but initially would get upset when he was going out to work on the Channel 4 soap opera, Hollyoaks. ""He was able to get on with his life whereas I was in bed struggling with the consequences. I wasn't thinking straight, I know he was trying to be strong for me. ""Then I caught AJ crying once and he was trying to say 'I'm sorry, I'm sorry'. I was shocked because he'd obviously been keeping it in for weeks."" Quinnen said she has cried every day since her accident in mid-January up until last week, but is now trying focus on her goal of being back on stage, performing alongside Pritchard and his brother Curtis in their autumn tour. She also wants to start a petition to get videos like the one she and her partner were trying to recreate removed from YouTube so no one else gets injured like her. She says she has asked ""Why did this happen to me?"" and is very anxious. ""I don't go out too much and I'm constantly thinking something else bad is going to happen."" Qunnen also paid tribute to the NHS medics who cared for her. ""They are the closest thing to superheroes. My surgeon was amazing - I trusted her with my life. And all the nurses are so amazing."" Doctors have told her they won't know for another two years how much scarring she will have on her face in the long-term. As to her future with Pritchard, she says they've talked about marriage and children. ""AJ has been incredible. By my side the whole time, feeding me and cleaning my wounds,"" she added. ""I would love to get married to AJ. He is my dream man. I can't imagine my life without him.""

"This video can not be played Emergency crews attended the collapse late on Monday near the Olivos station on the metro's 12 Line Mexican authorities have promised a full investigation into the collapse of a metro overpass in Mexico City, as questions mount over the line's safety. President AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador said ""nothing would be hidden"" while the mayor said an external company would be involved in the inquiry. The elevated track on Line 12 fell on to a road, killing at least 24 people. Concerns over possible structural failures had been raised since the line was inaugurated, in 2012. There were concerns about design problems and construction standards, as well as allegations of corruption. In pictures: Shock, grief, anger in Mexico over metro crash 'We heard a loud thunder and everything fell apart' At a news conference, President LÃ³pez Obrador said the investigation, to be carried out by federal and Mexico City prosecutors, should be done quickly. ""We cannot get into speculation, much less blame the possible perpetrators without having proof,"" he said. The line was built when Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard, a close ally of the president, was mayor of the capital. Speaking alongside the president, Mr Ebrard said it was a ""very sad day for everyone"". Current Mayor Claudia Sheinbaum also said it was too soon to say who was responsible for what happened. Earlier, she said it appeared a girder had given way on the overpass. The line will remain closed while a structural survey is carried out. Images show the site of the incident now and in 2019 CCTV footage showed the overpass collapsing as a train was travelling over it, sending up clouds of debris and sparks. The crash happened near the Olivos station, in the south-east of the city, on Monday night. Fernando Espino, secretary-general of the union representing metro workers, said the incident was related to a construction problem. ""This is a structural failure... We don't know if it's related to the material with which this [section] was built. We need to see what happened,"" he said, according to El Universal newspaper. Elevated parts of the line, including the collapsed overpass, had to be closed for multiple repairs in 2014. Residents also reported cracks in the structure after an earthquake in 2017, and transport authorities made repairs following the reports. In 2017, the then director of the city's metro, Jorge GaviÃ±o, said the line ""was born with endemic problems that would never be solved in its life"" and that it would require ""permanent"" maintenance. Cranes were deployed to stabilise and remove the train carriages from the structure The overpass collapsed as a train was travelling over it On Tuesday, cranes were deployed to stabilise and remove the two train carriages that remained hanging from the structure. ""We never had much faith in this metro [line],"" 62-year-old Maria Concepcion, who heard the collapse from her house, told Reuters news agency. CCICSA, one of the firms involved in the construction of the line, said in a statement to Reuters it was ""going to wait for the official expert opinion"". French train maker Alstom said it was willing to ""co-operate with and to aid authorities responsible for investigations in any way necessary"". At least 79 people were injured, including one person who had been pulled out alive from a car underneath the wreckage. The mayor said the dead included children, but she did not give details. Mexico City's metro system is one of the most used in the world, carrying tens of millions of passengers a week. In North America, only New York's subway carries more people every day. Yet the incident did not occur on one of the older lines, which have been through at least two major earthquakes in the past 35 years. Rather it happened on Line 12, completed as recently as October 2012. There will be difficult questions for the mayor's office to come about the construction of the line, including for several former mayors. This is the deadliest incident in decades for the city's metro system. In 1975, two underground trains collided, killing 31 people. Last year,one person was killedand more than 40 injured in a collision between two metro trains elsewhere in Mexico City. Were you in the area? Did you witness what happened?

"Sir Jeffrey Donaldson and Edwin Poots are in the running for the DUP leadership The vote to elect the next leader of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) will take place on 14 May, the party has said. Party officers met on Tuesday to discuss the procedure and timetable for the election of both a new leader and deputy leader. Agriculture Minister Edwin Poots and MP Sir Jeffrey Donaldson are bidding to succeed Arlene Foster. She steps down as DUP leaderon 28 May and first minister at the end of June. It is the first time in the party's 50-year history that a leadership contest has taken place. An announcement on the next leader is expected by 17:00 BST on 14 May, the party said. The meeting, to be overseen by party chairman Lord Morrow, will be conducted virtually. The party said contenders for both leader and deputy leader must submit their expression of interest by 17:00 BST on 6 May. The current deputy leader of the party is Lord Dodds. Mr Pootsbegan his leadership bid last Thursday, while Sir Jeffreyannounced his bid on Monday, the 100th anniversary of the formation of Northern Ireland. In a statement on Tuesday evening, Lord Morrow said the date of 14 May was chosen to reflect the fact that Covid restrictions are due to be reviewed at a meeting of the NI Executive on 13 May, and that the Queen's speech will take place in Parliament on 12 May. He said DUP representatives will be required to attend both commitments. ""In accordance with the constitution and rules of the Democratic Unionist Party, only party members, who are also members of the Northern Ireland Assembly and the House of Commons, are entitled to vote for the leader or deputy leader."" There are 28 DUP MLAs (Members of the Legislative Assembly) and eight MPs. South Down DUP MLA Jim Wells, who lost the whip in 2018 after he criticised the party leadership in the media, told BBC News NI he had received the letter that went to all DUP MLAs and MPs on Tuesday evening, informing them about the process for the vote. He said he was ""delighted"" his vote would count and reiterated he would be supporting Mr Poots. Arlene Foster will step down as DUP leader on 28 May Several senior DUP Stormont assembly members and the MP Paul Girvan have declared their support for Mr Poots. Speaking in the Northern Ireland Assembly on Tuesday, the Lagan Valley MLA confirmed he had ""no desire"" to hold the position of first minister should he be elected DUP leader. It is understood he would want to remain agriculture minister. Sir Jeffrey, the MP for Lagan Valley, has the backing of MPs Gavin Robinson and Jim Shannon as well as Education Minister Peter Weir and Junior Minister Gordon Lyons. Campaigners for both contenders claim their candidate has significant support within the party ranks. Sitting in the Stormont chamber on Tuesday, Arlene Foster cut a lonely figure on the benches where she once ruled. She was socially and politically distant from previously loyal supporters who signed a letter of no confidence in her leadership last week, forcing her to quit. Apart for the odd polite smile to those opposite wishing her well for the future, she showed no emotion. First Minister Arlene Foster (in yellow jacket) in the assembly chamber on Tuesday As she exited the chamber, one of the men who wants to replace her as leader entered through another door. Unlike Mrs Foster, Edwin Poots shared the benches with those who have already expressed support for his leadership bid. The contrast was stark. In order to become party leader, a candidate must secure the support of at least 18 of the party's assembly members and MPs. Mrs Fosterannounced her decision to resignafter facing a revolt from DUP members last week. She had led the party since December 2015 and was appointed first minister of Northern Ireland the following month. DUP facing divisive leadership battle BBC News NI understands that she will sever her ties with the DUP when she stands down as first minister, with sources close to her saying she thinks it is no longer the party she joined. Mrs Foster did not take part in a Tuesday morning meeting with her assembly team. The first minister was in the assembly chamber later as Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill responded to questions to the Executive Office.

"Joe McCann was shot near his home in the Markets area of Belfast in April 1972 Two former paratroopers accused of the murder of an Official IRA man in 1972 have been formally acquitted after their trial collapsed. Joe McCann, 24, was shot in disputed circumstances at Joy Street in the Markets area of Belfast in April 1972. The court heard he was evading arrest when soldiers opened fire, killing him. Soldiers A and C, both in their 70s, had pleaded not guilty. The men admitted firing shots but said they had acted lawfully when doing so. Both soldiers were interviewed by a police legacy unit, the Historical Enquiries Team (HET), in 2010 and it was that evidence which formed a substantial part of the prosecution's case. The judge ruled that evidence as inadmissible and the Public Prosecution Service (PPS) confirmed on Tuesday it would not appeal against that decision, meaning the case could not proceed. After the prosecution confirmed it would be presenting no further evidence in the case, the judge told both former soldiers: ""In the circumstances, Mr A and C, I formally find you not guilty of the charge of murder."" Speaking outside court, Mr McCann's daughter AÃ­ne said there had been ""a failure of the state at all levels"" in relation to her father's death. ""The RUC (Royal Ulster Constabulary) failed, the criminal justice failed, not only in this case but in the case of many other families,"" she said. Mr McCann's daughters Maura and AÃ­ne accompanied his widow Anne (centre) and son Fergal (right) to court Mr McCann's family are to apply to the attorney general to open an inquest into his killing. Their solicitor Niall Murphy said: ""This ruling does not acquit the state of murder."" He added: ""Today is not the end of the McCanns' journey for justice."" It will take time for the fallout from the collapse of this case to become clear. Firstly, prosecutors will examine the implications, if any, for other Troubles legacy cases involving Army veterans. In four of them, decisions to bring charges have already been made - three other cases have still to be ruled upon. In each of the cases, input from the Historical Enquiries Team (HET) will be looked at closely. However, at this stage prosecutors do not anticipate there being a huge impact. Secondly, Tuesday's development will likely intensify the debate around future Troubles prosecutions and legacy matters generally. Political capital will be made from what has happened in a Belfast courtroom. The government wants to bring forward legislation protecting veterans who served in Northern Ireland and all ears will be on the Queen's speech next week. Solicitors for the former soldiers said the prosecution should ""never have got off the ground"" and called for an inquiry led by a senior judge to investigate ""the decision-making process and to ensure that the decision to prosecute these veterans was not political."" In a statement, the PPS confirmed it had decided to offer no further evidence against two former soldiers. Michael Agnew, the deputy director of public prosecutions, said that in spite of the verdict the PPS was satisfied the case had been properly brought before the courts. He said evidence received in 2016 relating to the case was subjected to ""a very thorough and careful examination by a team of experienced lawyers, including senior counsel"" before the test for prosecution was met. ""The case overcame a number of legal challenges before reaching trial,"" he said. Political reaction to collapse of soldiers' trial ""These challenges included an abuse of process application following which a High Court judge ruled that there was no unfairness in the decision to prosecute and that in all the circumstances the defendants could get a fair trial."" He added that the PPS ""fully respected"" the judge's ruling and acknowledged ""the enduring pain of the McCann family and how difficult this development has been for them"". Mr Agnew said when the full written judgement became available, the PPS would ""carefully consider whether it has the potential to impact upon any other cases that are currently before the courts"". Det Supt Stephen Wright of PSNI's legacy investigation branch said: ""We will await the publication of the written judgment and take time to consider it fully and any impact it might have on other legacy investigations."" The trial opened last Monday and heard a day of evidence before moving to the issue of whether statements and interviews given by the ex-soldiers would be admissible. The court was told that evidence implicating the soldiers came from two sources - statements given to the Royal Military Police in 1972 and interview answers given to the HET in 2010. The PPS accepted that the 1972 statements would be inadmissible in isolation, due to deficiencies in how they were taken including that the soldiers were ordered to make them and they were not conducted under caution. Former Veterans Minister Johnny Mercer attended the trial in Belfast However, prosecutors argued that the information in the 1972 statements became admissible because they were adopted and accepted by the defendants during their engagement with the HET in March 2010. However, the judge said it was not legitimate to put the 1972 evidence before the court ""dressed up and freshened up with a new 2010 cover"". He questioned why the HET's re-examination did not prompt a fresh investigation by the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI), with the veterans interviewed under caution. The judge suggested that course of action might have made a prosecution more sustainable. Former Veterans Minister Johnny Mercer, who left the government in April over legal protections for troops who served during the Troubles in Northern Ireland, attended the trial. Speaking after it collapsed, he said he was ""delighted"" for the former soldiers, adding he hoped they could ""go and live the rest of their lives in peace"". ""The government has made very clear promises, and the prime minister has made very clear promises, on legislation to end the relentless pursuit of those who served their country in Northern Ireland,"" he said. ""It is time to deliver on that."" Four other cases in relation to Army veterans are currently before the courts.

"Abbie and AJ were trying to film a trick for social media when the accident happened Dancer Abbie Quinnen, who was badly burned when a social media stunt went wrong, says she has received ""horrible"" messages from trolls on Instagram since the accident in January. Quinnen and her partner, ex-Strictly star AJ Pritchard, were due to film a trick with highly-flammable liquid when a fireball ""shot across the room"". The 23-year-old suffered second and third degree burns across her body. One of the Instagram messages said: ""You should have burned to death."" Recounting the initial incident to Victoria Derbyshire on BBC Radio 2's Jeremy Vine Show, Quinnen said she immediately screamed for help as the liquid caught fire uncontrollably. ""I was in shock and thinking, how can I survive this?"" she said. ""I rolled on the floor and that didn't work, so I grabbed a heavy blanket and started trying to put out the flames that way. ""AJ was getting damp towels in the meantime."" Although it was over in seconds, she said ""it felt like a lifetime"" and she kept asking Pritchard, ""Is my face going to be okay? Am I going to be okay? Will you still love me?"" The dancer suffered second and third degree burns to her face, head, neck, ear, chest and down her right side; she also lost some of her hair. She has had three skin graft operations, two of which involved using someone else's skin - called an allograft. ""I could have been blinded. I could have lost my hearing. I'm so lucky. It could have been even worse,"" she said. At one point the dancer was having to take 27 tablets a day to cope with the pain. Quinnen said she has been helped by many people on Instagram who have shared their own experiences of being burned. But others have posted messages including: ""You should have burned to death""; ""You're now going to look like a waxwork model""; and ""Don't go near your niece and nephew, you'll scare them"". ""It's so horrible, I just think it's really sad and I feel a bit sorry for them,"" Quinnen said. One of the hardest things for her was thinking she would never look the same again. ""When I was in hospital, staff tried every day to persuade me to talk to a therapist, but I just didn't want to, I wasn't ready. Even looking at the reflection of my face in my 'phone screen was hideous,"" she said. When eventually spoke with a counsellor, they asked her to look into a mirror to help her accept what had happened to her. ""I was hysterical,"" she said. She credits Pritchard with helping her recover, but initially would get upset when he was going out to work on the Channel 4 soap opera, Hollyoaks. ""He was able to get on with his life whereas I was in bed struggling with the consequences. I wasn't thinking straight, I know he was trying to be strong for me. ""Then I caught AJ crying once and he was trying to say 'I'm sorry, I'm sorry'. I was shocked because he'd obviously been keeping it in for weeks."" Quinnen said she has cried every day since her accident in mid-January up until last week, but is now trying focus on her goal of being back on stage, performing alongside Pritchard and his brother Curtis in their autumn tour. She also wants to start a petition to get videos like the one she and her partner were trying to recreate removed from YouTube so no one else gets injured like her. She says she has asked ""Why did this happen to me?"" and is very anxious. ""I don't go out too much and I'm constantly thinking something else bad is going to happen."" Qunnen also paid tribute to the NHS medics who cared for her. ""They are the closest thing to superheroes. My surgeon was amazing - I trusted her with my life. And all the nurses are so amazing."" Doctors have told her they won't know for another two years how much scarring she will have on her face in the long-term. As to her future with Pritchard, she says they've talked about marriage and children. ""AJ has been incredible. By my side the whole time, feeding me and cleaning my wounds,"" she added. ""I would love to get married to AJ. He is my dream man. I can't imagine my life without him.""

"Boris Johnson and US Secretary of State Antony Blinken discussed the ""close alignment"" between foreign policy in London and Washington during their meeting earlier, No 10 has said. A No 10 spokeswoman said the PM and Mr Blinken agreed UK-US co-operation would be ""instrumental"" in tackling Covid-19. They also welcomed their nations' joint work on areas like trade and defence. It came as G7 powers met in London for their first face-to-face meetings in over two years. The group is discussing challenges including climate change and threats to human rights. The talks, held amid tight Covid restrictions, will finish on Wednesday. The G7 group - the world's seven largest so-called advanced economies - is made up of the UK, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States. Australia, India, South Korea and South Africa have also been invited as guests, as the UK tries to deepen ties with the Indo-Pacific region. The UK, which currently holds the rotating presidency of the G7, willhost a leaders' summitin Cornwall next month. At their meeting, Mr Johnson and Mr Blinken agreed that UK-US co-operation would be ""instrumental"" in making progress in the fight against coronavirus, alongside ""protecting the environment and other international priorities"", the spokeswoman said. They also agreed that the global rollout of coronavirus vaccines would be key in beating the pandemic, and emphasised the ""importance of G7 work in this area, including efforts to increase international manufacturing capability"". The spokeswoman added that foreign policy issues, including Afghanistan, Iran and China, were also discussed, and Mr Johnson ""looked forward to welcoming"" US President Joe Biden to the UK when he attends the leaders' summit in June - hisfirst overseas trip since his election victory. Rich states want to send 40m more girls to school What is the G7 and what does it do? UK and India agree to let more young people in Earlier, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the summit of foreign ministers ""demonstrates that diplomacy is back"", and showed the importance of ""getting countries together"". Mr Raab, wearing a face mask, welcomed counterparts earlier at Lancaster House in London, with forearm bumps replacing the usual handshakes. After talks on Myanmar on Tuesday morning, the G7 discussed issues including the crisis in Libya and the war in Syria. Politicians kept their distance for the traditional group photo Mr Raab was expected to urge stronger co-operation between the G7 and the guest nations at a working dinner on Tuesday evening. Speaking ahead of the dinner on Tuesday, he told reporters the summit provided a ""good opportunity"" to talk to India, a guest at the summit, about how G7 nations could help the country amid itsspike in Covid cases. This included a chance to seek ""positive answers"" about what developed nations would do with surplus domestic supplies of vaccines, he added. Lancaster House in central London has played host to many historic negotiations, but rarely will it have seen such diplomatic speed dating as it will later. For the next few days, foreign ministers will scurry round the clock from meeting to meeting, doing as much business face to face as they can after months of virtual diplomacy. They will discuss the world's big geopolitical issues: from China to Myanmar, Ethiopia to Ukraine, Syria to the Sahel. The underlying theme will be how they can best organise to defend international rules and open societies against the threat of autocratic regimes. And for the UK, the meeting's host, it's a big test to see if its global foreign policy can live up to its name. The summit comes amid criticism over the UK's decision to cut overseas aid spending from 0.7% of national income to 0.5% - a reduction of more than Â£4bn. Mr Raab said this had been a ""difficult decision"" but that the UK still had scope ""to be an even greater force for good in the world"". On Monday, it was announced that the G7 would use the summit to commit toinvesting $15bn (Â£10.8bn) to help women in developing countries. They are also expected to agree a new target of sending 40 million more girls from low and middle-income countries to school within five years.

"Calls for a second national lockdown have also come from business leaders and health experts India's main opposition party has called for a full national lockdown, shortly after the country passed more than 20 million Covid-19 infections. There has been a ""virtual collapse of health services"" and a lockdown is needed to ""break the chain"", a spokesman for the Congress party said. The prime minister is resisting the move due to the economic impact. India added more than 355,000 cases on Tuesday, down from more than 400,000 daily infections on 30 April. Cases are ""slowing down"", the government said, but testing numbers have also dipped meaning the true caseload could be far higher. India's Covid crisis: Your questions answered Deadly second wave spreads from cities to small towns Backlash after China Weibo post mocks India Covid crisis ""We are now forced - there is no option - [we] will have to resort to a national lockdown to break the chain, to restore some order in the health services,"" Pawan Khera, a spokesman for the opposition Congress party told the BBC on Tuesday. Rahul Gandhi, a senior Congress leader, said there was no other way to stop the spread of the virus. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Calls for a second national lockdown have also come from business leaders, international health experts and other senior politicians. Members of India's Covid-19 taskforce, which advises the central government, are ""pushing hard"" for a two-week lockdown, The Indian Express reported. Dr Anthony Fauci, America's top public health expert, described the situation as ""extremely serious"" and said a nationwide lockdown was needed alongside a massive vaccination drive and the construction of makeshift hospitals. The decision to impose restrictions in India is made by individual state authorities rather than the central government. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has said that states should only consider restrictions as ""a last option"". But many states have still introduced restrictions. The northern state of Bihar is the latest to have announced a full lockdown while the capital, Delhi, and the financial hub, Mumbai, are also under restrictions. Prime Minister Modi was heavily criticised last year for imposing a nationwide lockdown with less than four hours' notice. It caused a  humanitarian crisis as tens of thousands of migrant workers were left without work and forced to walk hundreds of kilometres to their home villages. Locked down India struggles as workers flee cities India's PM seeks 'forgiveness' over virus lockdown The lockdown also saw India's economic output fall by a record 24% between April and June 2020 compared to the same period a year earlier, and the government has said another national lockdown would have dire consequences for the economy. India's second wave has been fuelled by lax safety protocols and massive public festivals and election rallies. It has overwhelmed its hospitals and delays in testing, diagnosis and treatment - as well as a shortage of critical care beds and crucial drugs - have resulted in a spike in deaths. The country has so far reported more than 222,000 deaths due to the virus. But experts say India's Covid death toll is vastly under-reported. There have been very long lines at crematoriums, mass funeral pyres and cities running out of space to bury or cremate the dead. India's cases have risen over the past week, but at a slower rate than in previous weeks. And daily cases have fallen in Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra which are all hotspots of the crisis. Erratic testing, however, makes it hard to gauge the significance of these numbers. Insufficient testing has proved to be another issue. Health officials said there was ""cautious hope"" of some respite from the second wave. But Lav Agarwal, joint secretary of the health ministry, said progress needed to be sustained by ""containment measures at district and state level"". Experts have also said other hotspots are likely to emerge in the coming weeks as the pandemic moves through the country. Meanwhile, an oxygen shortage has shown no signs of abating and people in several hotspot cities, including Delhi, are struggling for treatment. A sluggish vaccination campaign has compounded the crisis. Since January, India has administered more than 157 million vaccine doses which ranks third in the world after China and the United States. But just over 10% of India's 1.4 billion people have had one dose and only about 2% have received both doses. Despite being the world's biggest producer of vaccines, India is facing a shortage of supplies. And vaccination rates are down. The chief executive of India's Serum Institute, the world's biggest vaccine manufacturer,has warned shortages will last for months,external.

"This video can not be played Emergency crews attended the collapse late on Monday near the Olivos station on the metro's 12 Line A metro overpass has collapsed in Mexico City as a train was travelling over it, killing at least 23 people, including children, the mayor said. Two train carriages were seen hanging from the structure, above a busy road. At least 79 people were injured, and seven are in a serious condition. One person trapped in a car underneath the wreckage was pulled out alive. This is the deadliest incident in decades in the city's metro system, one of the busiest in the world. Local media broadcast CCTV footage showing the overpass collapsing, sending up clouds of debris. The crash happened at around 22:00 local time on Monday (03:00 GMT) near the Olivos station on the metro's Line 12, in the south-east of the city. Mexico City Mayor Claudia Sheinbaum said an external company would investigate the cause of the incident. Earlier, she said it appeared a girder had given way on the overpass. The line, inaugurated less than a decade ago, will remain closed while a structural survey is carried out. Speaking at a news conference alongside the mayor, President AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador offered his condolences to the relatives of the victims and said that ""nothing would be hidden"" from the Mexican people. Residents had reported cracks in the structure after a deadly 2017 earthquake, according to local media. Mexico's El Universal newspaper says transport authorities made repairs following the reports. The incident happened on Monday night local time The injured were taken to local hospitals A crane was sent to the scene to stabilise the carriages amid concerns they could fall onto the road, which forced officials to temporarily halt rescue efforts at night. In chaotic scenes, anxious friends and relatives of those believed to be on the train gathered in the area. EfraÃ­n JuÃ¡rez told AFP news agency that his son was in the wreckage. ""My daughter-in-law called us. She was with him and she told us the structure fell down over them."" Gisela Rioja Castro, 43, was looking for her 42-year-old husband, who always takes that train after work and had not been answering his phone. She said the authorities had no information about him. ""Nobody knows anything,"" she told the Associated Press. Images show the site of the incident now and in 2019 A passenger, 26-year-old Mariana, told El Universal that she and other people trapped among the carriage's twisted metal managed to escape through a window. ""We only heard a loud thunder, and everything fell apart,"" she said of the moment of the incident. ""There were many people standing and sitting in the carriage, and when the carriage fell, we went flying and hit our heads on its roof."" The search operation had to be paused for some time amid fears of a further collapse The area around the crash site has been sealed off One eyewitness told Mexico's Televisa TV network: ""Suddenly I saw that the structure was shaking."" ""When the dust cleared we ran... to see if we could help. There were no screams. I don't know if they were in shock,"" the witness said. Mexico City's metro system is one of the most used in the world, carrying tens of millions of passengers a week. In North America, only New York's subway carries more people every day. Yet the incident did not occur on one of the older lines, which have been through at least two major earthquakes in the past 35 years. Rather it happened on Line 12, completed as recently as October 2012. There will be difficult questions for the mayor's office to come about the construction of the line, including for several former mayors. They include Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard, who was in office when Line 12 was unveiled and who championed the metro's expansion. He called the accident a ""terrible tragedy"". However, those questions must wait until later. The moment now is solely about the rescue operation as Mexicans pray the number of victims does not rise any further.

postal voting papers, despite having requested them weeks ago. The local authority says itâs
also been contacted by several electoral candidates, who raised the issue. It is asking anyone
who has not yet received their papers to contact its election team as quickly
as possible. The council does not yet know how many papers are missing. There was also a delay in sending out postal votes in Sheffield, with 15,000 going out over the Bank Holiday weekend. People are being encouraged to return the ballots on the day they arrive. The Electoral Commission said it was aware some councils had reported printing issues and it was supporting them to have everything in place before polls open on Thursday. Completed postal votes must be returned by the close of voting at 10pm on Thursday. Those who have not managed to send their ballots back can hand them in at their local polling station. Philip SimBBC Scotland political correspondent With two days to go until the Holyrood election, there seems to be little mystery about the final result - with only the SNP talking about forming a government. But there are still some key questions to be answered, which could have a huge bearing on Scotland's future. Will the SNP secure an outright majority? Could they build a pro-independence majority with the help of other, smaller parties? Will the Conservatives hold off a Labour challenge in the battle for second place? And what are the factors which could help answer these questions? Five key factors could determine the answers to these critical questions: Read Philip's full analysis of these questionshere. Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey has been campaigning in Edinburgh today. He said Covid had reminded everyone just how important local community is and his party was offering ""local champions"" in these elections. He added that people appreciate their local green spaces more than ever and the Lib Dems had put the environment at the heart of their campaign. Sir Ed said: ""The Liberal Democrat environment record in local government is unbeatable, whether it's delivering the country's first clean air zone outside of London to topping the country's leader board for recycling rates.""

Almost 700 libraries have closed across Britain since 2010 as councils look at ways to save money, but in Middlesbrough they are spending more. It is thought almost one in 10 children in the town do not own a book and it has a problem with literacy. Mother-of-three Nisha Mayuran, who is originally from Sri Lanka, has made it her family home. Ahead of Thursday's local elections across England , she explains how important the library is to her and her children.  Journalist: Chris Robinson, filmed and edited: Chris Middis Labour's Sadiq Khan is on course for a second term as London mayor, the latest opinion poll suggests, although his likely margin of victory could be narrower than previously predicted. For much of the campaign, pollsters have been suggesting Mr Khan could win on the first round of ballots, with more than 50% of first preference votes, under theSupplementary Vote,externalsystem used in the contest. A new poll by Opinium suggests Mr Khan will not get more than 50% of first preference votes, but he will get 63% of the vote after second preferences have been counted. According to Opinium, crime has now overtaken the NHS as the most important issue for Londoners. This is the only topic they've polled on where the Conservative candidate, Shaun Bailey, has a slight lead over Mr Khan. The Liberal Democrats and Greens are in a close contest for third and fourth places, according to the poll. The survey was of 1,005 London adults over 18, between 28 April to 3 May. Question from Paul Hodson, Buckingham Parish councils control millions of pounds in public funds, and influence our day-to-day lives. On 6 May, people across England will vote in local authority elections. But some live in areas where seats on parish and town councils - the most local of local authorities - will also be up for grabs.

government is due to set out its law-making priorities for the next year on
Tuesday next week, when the Queen will officially open the next annual
""session"" at the State Opening of Parliament. There have been reports that the speech will contain an ambition to reform the sector. But nothing has been officially announced as things stand. Boris Johnson said he had a ""clear plan"" for social carewhen he took office in July 2019and has been under pressure from opposition parties to announce a detailed blueprint.

We've produceda very simple guideto all the different elections so you know what is happening in your area and across the country. It's been suggest the brownies (not these ones) were in a box that read 'Vote Labour'. Police are investigating claims the Labour candidate for
West Yorkshire Mayor has broken election laws. There are allegations Tracy Brabin broke the law by
offering people brownies. A Lib Dem Councillor, Tom Gordon, tweeted it was the ""second time in as many days"" he had seen Ms Brabin  ""out and about with boxes of brownies on them that say  ""Vote Labour"" on them"". Labour says the cakes were offered to party members after
they had been campaigning â which would not be against the rules. The Electoral Commission says there is only a breach of the law if there is âcorrupt intentâ and it does not apply to
hospitality. Question from James in London The 2014 independence referendum was underpinned by a so-called section 30 order, under which Westminster gave the Scottish Parliament the power to carry out the vote. The SNP says,externalit will seek this power again if this month's Scottish Parliament elections produce a majority in favour of holding a new referendum. The party says if this request is rebuffed, it would pass a bill to hold a new referendum and it would be up to the UK government to challenge it in the courts. The UK government maintains that votes on constitutional matters require the prior agreement of Westminster. Question from Maxone in London In Greater London, the elected mayor is responsible for policing and has the same responsibilities as police and crime commissioners do in other areas. The role of a
PCC in London is carried out by the mayorâs appointed deputy for policing and
crime. The mayor also appoints the Metropolitan Police commissioner, who is in charge of the day-to-day running of the force and holds them to account.

But like many of its neighbours, it is starting to turn blue: it already has two Tory MPs, and the council is run by a minority Conservative administration. For Radio Four's World at One,BBC political reporter Rob Mayor,externalhas been finding out what people think of the upcoming elections: Council leader Patrick Harley is hoping to win a Conservative majority on Thursday. He says it will allow the town to attract investment from central government, as it has been doing for the last few years. But leader of the Labour group, Cllr Qadar Zada, says unemployment is ""up by 75%"" during the pandemic, with 20,000 young people out of work. Residents are also worried about crime, he says. Wendy Farmer, who has run a stall in the town's market for 30 years, says trade has fallen as all the big shops have closed. The council has not helped during the pandemic, she says. But she supports the prime minister. ""Those that criticise, I'd like to see them them do what he's had to put up with in the last 12 months,"" she says. A full list of all the candidate standing in the area can be found here,external. Question from James Georgeson in South Lanarkshire The pandemic has had a serious impact oncampaigning in Scotland,external, but things have become a bit easier for the parties as some restrictions have been lifted. Leafleting was allowed from 15 March, with campaigners allowed to do face-to-face doorstep canvassing in most areas of Scotland from 12 April, and most campaigners had to remain in their local areas until 1 May. Campaigning was also paused followingthe death of Prince Philip. Question from Gabriel Beck in Eastbourne Because the pandemic will delay vote-counting (see our post earlier), the BBC's results programme will begin later than usual at 09.00 BST on Friday on the BBC News Channel, BBC Two and the BBC iPlayer. It will also be shown on BBC One in the afternoon. Huw Edwards and Kirsty Wark will lead the show, which will be co-hosted from London and Edinburgh. Special coverage will continue on Saturday from 13.15 BST to 22.00 BST. The BBC News website will have all the results as they are announced, with live results, and live pages with the latest reaction and analysis from our correspondents. With just two days to go until polling day, some of the party leaders have been on the campaign trail. We have not seen Boris Johnson on any election visits today because he has been doing avirtual meeting with the Indian PM. Here's what we have learned so far:  Question from Ruth Yarwood in Anglesey Counting will be unusual this year because of the Covid pandemic, and will last several days. Some counts, like the Hartlepool by-election, will take place overnight on Thursday. We will know all the results for the Welsh Senedd on Friday. Scotland starts counting in some areas on Friday but there won't be a final result until Saturday, or possibly even Sunday. English councils are spread over four days from Thursday night until Sunday. A dozen of the Police and Crime Commissioner elections in England won't count until Monday. Question from Finn in Tunbridge Wells If you are worried about your completed postal vote not arriving in time, you can hand it in at your local polling station before voting closes at 22.00 BST on Thursday. Alternatively, you can take it to your local electoral registration office before it closes on Thursday. Â© 2025 BBC.

"The five leaders of Scotland's larger parties went head-to-head in the final TV debate of the Holyrood election campaign Nicola Sturgeon (SNP); Douglas Ross (Scottish Conservatives); Anas Sarwar (Scottish Labour); Patrick Harvie (Scottish Greens) and Willie Rennie (Scottish Lib Dems) took part Programme host Glenn Campbell questioned the panel on whether Scots should be allowed to go abroad this summer and what their plans for improving social care are Income tax and Scotland's constitutional future were also are at the heart of the live debate Earlier, BBC Scotland's The Campaign programme interviewed representatives of six smaller parties contesting the election It included Alex Salmond of Alba, All for Unityâs George Galloway; Reform UK Scotland's Michelle Ballantyne and UKIP Scotlandâs Donald Mackay The views of Richard Lucas of the Scottish Family Party and Carol Dobson of Freedom Alliance were also aired BBC Scotland News The leaders of the five larger parties faced off for the final time ahead of the Scottish Parliament election on 6 May. Here are the key points from the debate: Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent Tonight
we got a real flavour of whatâs at stake on Thursday. There are big devolved
issues which the next Parliament will decide on; health, income tax, social
care. There are more still there wasnât time for tonight. We
saw some of the caution thatâs likely when it comes to pandemic easing; many of
the parties urged exactly that when it comes to international travel starting
up again. And
yes, the issue that transcends so much in Scottish politics: independence. We
saw pressure on Nicola Sturgeon on the specifics (a detailed case will come
nearer the time of a referendum she says). On Douglas Ross on how Scots can
secure another referendum if they want one (heâs fighting to stop one he says).
On Anas Sarwar over whether heâll accept the will of the next Holyrood
parliament (a hint heâll oppose indyref2 whatever the result). Thereâs
a lot for voters to weigh up in the next 48 hours. If you're unsure which parties are standing in your constituency and who the candidates are, don't worry - help is at hand. Follow this linkand enter your postcode to see a full list. Author and independence campaigner Lesley Riddoch Broadcaster, author and independence campaigner Lesley Riddoch says none of the other parties really demonstrated why Nicola Sturgeon should not be the dominant force in Holyrood. Ms Riddoch says it is ""extraordinary"" that the towel has been so roundly thrown in by the other party leaders, who are all vying for second place. She argues Anas Sarwar has rehearsed his quips so well that he ""seems to win the day"" in the debate, but Labour are still lagging behind the Tories in the polls. Ms Riddoch says the ""stern, unyielding"" Conservative leader Douglas Ross seems to be more like what people want to stand up to Ms Sturgeon, despite Mr Sarwar coming across as more personable. Political commentator Andy McIver Political commentator Andy McIver does not think tonight's debate will decide whether SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon gets a majority. The former head of communications for the Scottish Conservatives says that question is ""real knife edge stuff"" and will be decided by what happens in a variety of constituencies or regions. ""I'm not sure tonight will have changed much."" However, Mr McIver says Ms Sturgeon softened some of the edges around the independence argument, making it quite clear she was strongly against a wildcat referendum. He says it's quite clear in his view that there will not be an indyref2 before 2023. Professor Sir John CurticeProfessor of Politics at Strathclyde University I would give Anas Sarwar the
prize again this evening for being the master of the quip â he has demonstrated that throughout these debates. But I'm not sure anyoneâs minds
would have been changed by what they heard tonight. If somebody were to land from Mars tomorrow and was given a vote in the Scottish election and was wondering what to do, the debate neatly illustrated the principal themes and difficulties behind this election: whether we should be having a referendum on independence or not, and, within that, questions about the substance of independence - where the SNP begin to struggle - and
then Brexit, where the Conservatives
begin to struggle. There is still a
secondary division within Scottish politics - whether you want a bigger or smaller state, whether you want more or less taxation. These are themes which we are all familiar with, but which have been largely absent in the campaign. But the programme illustrated there is a difference between a Tory and a Socialist, even
if on the question of independence, that division has been largely hidden from
view. The debate drew to a close on a consensual note about the desire to see family when the Covid-19 restrictions are limited. BBC Scotland political correspondent Philip Sim says all the parties have a lot in common when you look beyond the ""constitutional rammy"". Allow Twitter content?

The final question for the leaders is: What are you most looking forward to doing when the Covid
restrictions have been lifted? SNP leader Nicola Sturgeonsays hugging her
mum, dad and âwee sisterâ is what she wants to do more than anything. The
first minister says she wants to see businesses being able to trade
properly and for people to be able to go about their daily lives again, but
believes that for most people it is âthat family connectionâ they have missed the
most. Scottish Lib Dem leader Willie Renniesays heâs looking forward to sitting down with
his parents and enjoying an evening meal with his sister and grandchildren. âSelfishlyâ, he also wants to take part in âa masochistic hill race somewhereâ. As consensus breaks out, family is also at the core of the answer fromScottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar. ""I've not hugged my granny for over a year, I've not seen my
dad for well over a year,"" he says, adding that he is desperate to
see his loved ones, as everybody across the country is. Scottish Green co-leader Patrick Harviesays
the last time he was in the building hosting tonight's debate was for a beer
festival, and if he got the chance to go to another one he would be âin
absolute heavenâ. âIf I know my mum and dad well enough, they
would be there with me and it would be an increasingly huggy experience the
more sampling we did,â he added. Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Rossis also looking forward to spending more time
with family and hugging his parents, who have been unable to come into his
house despite living nearby. He and his wife are also expecting their second child next
month - and heâs hoping his family will be able to visit the newborn in hospital. Reality Check Douglas Ross says there are ""1.1 million people in Scotland who are taxed more for doing the same job than the rest of the UK"" The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) has crunched the numbers on this one. The key differences are the 19% and 21% rates either side of the basic 20% rate, as well as the extra percentage point on the higher rate and top rates of tax. The IFS said that 888,000 people would pay the 21% rate, 322,000 would pay 41% and 15,000 would pay 46%. That's a total of 1.2 million people paying more, which includes those people who are pulled into paying higher rates of tax because the threshold for them is lower in Scotland than it is in the rest of the UK. The IFS also says that taxpayers with incomes below Â£27,393 will pay less tax than they would in the rest of the UK. 
That's just over half of Scottish taxpayers. But the difference is small - no more than Â£20.97 this year. Turning to the constitution,Douglas Rossis asked about a Conservative tweet which said
an SNP majority was a guarantee of another independence referendum. The Scottish Conservative leader claimsNicola Sturgeonwould go ahead with an illegal
âwildcatâ referendum, taking her âeye off the ballâ when it comes to Covid
recovery. Mr Ross says the prime minister would turn down a request
for a referendum because the priority should be rebuilding after the pandemic. Ms Sturgeon insists she will not hold an âillegal
wildcat referendumâ if the SNP win a majority, saying she would ânot
countenance an illegal referendum, not least because it would not deliver
independenceâ. The SNP leader says she will be responsible and build and
ultimately win the case for independence through âpatient persuasion of people
across the countryâ. Scottish Labour leaderAnas Sarwarsays
the Conservativesâ approach on the constitution is âa gift to the SNPâ and
claims Douglas Ross is âonly interested in saving his skin, not saving the
unionâ. Mr Sarwar says he does not support a
referendum or independence and wants people to choose âsomething differentâ on
Thursday because the first minister cannot lead a referendum campaign and the
recovery at the same time. Willie Renniesays he doesnât want this to be the argument
for the next five years, because the people waiting an age for mental health
treatment or who are desperate for a job âdeserve better than thisâ. The Scottish Lib Dem leader says a nationalist majority will
lead to more arguments and a vote for his party will allow the focus to be on
the recovery. Patrick Harviedisagrees and insists the people of Scotland
must be asked if we are best placed to achieve a fairer and more equal society
and tackle climate change âas part of Boris Johnsonâs Brexit Britainâ. A small independent country would be better placed to tackle
the âincredible challengesâ Scotland faces, adds the Scottish Green co-leader. Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent This debate is a reminder
that there are big issues at stake on Thursday â not just the constitution and
independence. Many people will have the pandemic recovery on their mind â weâve
had hints tonight that Scotland could move slower than England when it comes to
international travel. Itâs also a reminder that the Scottish Parliament
controls how much income tax people pay in Scotland. The parties arenât
looking at changes - apart from the Conservatives, who think Scotland should be
brought back into line with UK rates. This is an election about devolved powers
â as well as whether Scotland should have more through independence. Glenn Campbell says there have been reports that  Boris Johnson will announce a new Royal Yacht, costing Â£200m, that will be named HMS Prince Philip. He asks the politicians if they are in favour. Patrick Harviesays prioritising a new Royal Yacht is âan
absurdityâ at a time when families are relying on foodbanks âbeggars
beliefâ. The Green co-leader says: âIâm not sure I can find a polite, broadcastable word to
describe the arrogance of that."" Willie Renniesays he can âprobably think of 500 other
thingsâ to spend Â£200m on and it is a âludicrous idea which will never happenâ. The Scottish Liberal Democrat leader labels it as one of Boris Johnsonâs âtricksâ to try to attract
attention. Nicola Sturgeonsays this is a"" ludicrous idea"" and
the only reason the prime minister is talking about this is to try and distract
attention from the ""sleaze that is swirling around him and his
government"". The SNP leader adds: âIt is another reason why Boris
Johnson should not be the guy who is making decisions about Scotland."" Anas Sarwarsays
the idea is âclearly a cheap stuntâ, which is âall the Conservatives have
leftâ. The Scottish Labour leader says if there is Â£200m going, âletâs put that into businesses, to
keep them going and keep people in jobsâ. Douglas Rosssays he
understands private investment would be sought to build such a yacht. The  Scottish Conservative leader says he would wait and see what private money was available
before making up his mind â but he wouldnât support public money being used for
the project. In a change of pace, the party leaders are asked to put their hands up if they have no fixed plans to increase income tax. Douglas Ross, Anas Sarwar, Nicola Sturgeon and Willie Rennie raise their hands, while Patrick Harvie says his party takes the view that this is not the time to do it. Nicola Sturgeonsays the issue is ""more complicated"" than hands up or hands down, and asks ""can we not have a proper debate?""  She says that given the economy will be recovering from the Covid
pandemic, tax stability really matters and states: âWe have no plans to raise
tax in the next parliamentâ. The SNP leader says that based on assumptions made about growth and tax revenues, the
SNPâs manifesto commitments can be funded - and that it is important to invest for the future and the transition to net-zero carbon
emissions. Douglas Rossattacks the SNP, claiming its manifesto is
âuncostedâ and that it isnât being âhonestâ with the public. He says the priority is Covid recovery, but by the end of the
parliament he would like to see parity in the tax system. The Scottish Conservative leader says 1.1 million people in
Scotland are paying more tax than they would if they lived south of the border. Anas Sarwarsays Douglas Ross would rather give
himself a tax-cut, rather than people across the country, and says Labour do
want to raise tax by taxing online giants like Amazon. The Scottish Labour leader says he still
supports the principle of a more progressive tax system. However, the
presumption would be to not increase income taxes through the course of the
recovery and thereafter raise income tax on those earning more than Â£150,000. Willie Renniesays his party have an âaspirationâ towards
a universal basic income but the priority for the next parliament will be to
put the recovery from Covid first and invest in more mental health services and
3,500 more teachers, as well as a youth jobs guarantee. The Scottish Liberal Democrat leader insists this could
all be done within the medium term financial strategy already set out by the
Scottish government. Patrick Harviesays most people recognise that the recovery
phase from Covid is a chance to create a fairer and greener Scotland. The Greens' co-leader says the focus shouldnât just be on income tax â he wants
a reform of council tax to create a âfairer wealth taxâ. He says all the main political parties have agreed there
needs to be a deep look at all aspects to taxation not just to create
investment, but also a fairer distribution of wealth. Andrew KerrScottish political correspondent Itâs the big issue that affects all of us or our families - how we provide care.

Thereâs a real divergence with the parties here.  Three out of the five support a new National Care Service. Itâs a key part of the SNP manifesto - and Nicola Sturgeon said the pandemic shone a light into the system. Questioned why a global pandemic had forced the issue, Ms Sturgeon said a number of reforms had been put in place already but wanted now to see consistent, national standards moving to a structure of ownership not based on profit. The national care service is also backed by Labour - with Anas Sarwar saying he was being frank in pointing out it wouldnât be getting into public hands overnight. The Greensâ Patrick Harvie said that eventually there should be a non-profit and default public sector expectation.  Itâs fair to say they take the strongest line on this. Douglas Ross of the Conservatives questioned the criticism of private providers. The Tories are not convinced by a new national service as theyâre wary of unnecessary reform but he did say he would keep looking at the issue. The Liberal Democrats share that scepticism.  Willie Rennie said he didnât want to repeat the mistakes of the centralisation of the police - but invest in the skills and talent of staff.

He warned that a sticking-plaster approach didnât deal with the fundamental problems in the care service. Whatever approach is taken - the voters are watching - and worrying about the issue. The second question for the party leaders is on the subject of social care. Glenn Campbell asks what a national care service would do? Labour leader Anas Sarwarsays national standards
and a human rights approach much be applied to social care, along with more
investment in the workforce. He says it wonât be possible to get social care entirely
into public hands overnight â  there will have to be a âpartnership
between the public service, the voluntary sector and also the private sectorâ. Conservative leader Douglas Rosssays all the staff in the care sector must be
recognised as going âabove and beyondâ under some of the most difficult
circumstances. On pay, he says we must look at what care staff are asking
for and see what is achievable, as there is a âlooming economic crisisâ as we
come out of the pandemic. Scottish Greens
co-leader Patrick Harviesays his party agree on the need for an
increase in the carersâ allowance and the grant for unpaid carers. The issue
exposes the âhistoric under-valuing of care workâ which is âcritical to
peopleâs wellbeing"", and he believes the âdefaultâ expectation should be that
the public sector runs the care sector. SNP leader Nicola Sturgeonsays the pandemic has undoubtedly shone a
light on the strength of our care system, but also the fragilities of it. We must be bold about the legacy we want to see come out of
this pandemic, and a national care service should be one of these ambitions,
argues the SNP leader. Lib Dem leader Willie Renniesays his party is very wary about a national
care service as he does not want to repeat the mistakes of the centralisation
of the police. He says we need to invest in the
skills and talents of the staff in the sector and avoid a centralised service, as that would be a mistake. Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent The last few days of an election are about hammering home key messages. You can expect that tonight; each of the five leaders want to remind you of their central themes.
Itâs also about turnout, which could be more important than ever in this pandemic election. Can the SNP persuade their supporters to come out, giving them more of a chance of achieving the majority they want? You can expect to hear the other parties talk a lot about the regional ballot vote tonight; it will be crucial in the race for second place between the Conservatives and Labour, as well as for the fortunes of the Greens and Lib Dems. This has been a strange election. Political reporters like me have missed the big events, the public interactions that produce colour and the odd confrontation too. There hasnât been as much canvassing, no street stalls, no big rallies. That makes these televised debates even more important to the parties. One final chance to win you over. BBC Scotland political editor Glenn Campbell kicks off the leaders debate with his first question, on easing lockdown rules. He asks: Should people be able to go abroad on holiday from 17 May? Scottish Conservatives leader
Douglas Rosssays people are understandably still concerned about bringing the
virus back into the UK. He urges caution and says âletâs have staycations in Scotland, letâs look at
what we have on our own shoresâ. Scottish Greens co-leader Patrick Harvieworries that we might get back to the situation of last summer, when a second wave of cases occurred as a result of importation of new cases. He says that while the rest of the world is still waiting to vaccinated, the risk of importing new, potentially more dangerous, remains high, and international travel will have to be one of the last things to be lifted. SNP leader Nicola Sturgonsays a decision hasnât yet been
taken on foreign travel  - but it is one of the first decisions a first
minister will be taking next week. She says she wants to get international travel back to normal
as much as she want other aspects of our lives back to normal, but says it may have to wait âa
little bit longerâ. Anas Sarwar, the Scottish Labour leader, says in an ideal situation he would like to see a consistent approach across the UK, but adds we should not be afraid to do things differently in Scotland if that is the right thing to do. Mr Sarwar adds that the big frustration for the tourism and aviation industries has been the lack of communication, and he calls for them to be given a clear route map. Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Renniemaintains caution should be the watchword, with lessons learnt from the mistakes of last year, when travel restrictions were eased âtoo quicklyâ. We need consistency across the UK if possible, Mr Rennie adds, and need to recognise that other countries have not been as fast as the UK in rolling out a vaccine programme. Andrew KerrScottish political correspondent How cranky will the politicians be with each other in this leadersâ debate? Each of these set-piece events has had a different tone and feel to it.

The first BBC debate â away back at the beginning of the campaign â was quite calm. There was a new cast list â Douglas Ross from the Conservatives, Anas Sarwar from Labour and Lorna Slater from the Greens were on stage for the first time with their fellow performers. The SNPâs Nicola Sturgeon and Willie Rennie of the Liberal Democrats are old hands, having toured the halls and venues of Scotland with their leader debate shows. The new gang took a while to find their feet, with no audience â but it got a bit more lively towards the end. For the STV debate further into the campaign they loosened up a bit.  Allowed to question each other, they werenât shy in putting their points forward.  The new team had bonded. By the time it got to the Channel 4 debate last week, it felt as though they were pretty tired and fed-up of each other. It got cranky.

Douglas Ross and Nicola Sturgeon were arguing, while Anas Sarwar tried to join in from the sidelines.

It felt as if the pressures of the campaign were showing. Weâre nearer polling day now and the focus in this BBC debate will be on key messages.  It might return to being a little more restrained as the end is now in sight â or they might want to vent at each other.

Tune in to see. Alba leader Alex Salmond insists his party has helped
support for independence because they have put it âfront and centreâ of the
election campaign. Mr Salmond told BBC Scotland's The Campaign programme that his party had brought an ""injection of
vim and vigour"" which will ""hopefully"" be rewarded in Thursday's election. If the Scottish Parliament begin negotiations with Westminster over a second independence referendum immediately after the election, Scotland could be an independent country in a little over four years, Mr Salmond claimed. In the years before the first indyref, Mr Salmond said support for independence was only at around 28-30%, but there is a now a "" very substantial argument"" that support for independence is ""ahead of
the politicians"". Instead of wasting their vote, if even a quarter of SNP voters switch to Alba on the regional list, then there will be a barrowload of Alba MSPs elected this week."" Alex Salmond, Alba Party leader You can read more about theAlba Party's policies here. Michelle Ballantyne of Reform UK said her party understood that decisions should be taken close to the people, and that the devolved parliament in Scotland could be a positive thing. She said Reform UK's approach was ""fundamentally about common sense"". The party began its life as the Brexit party, and Ms Ballantyne was elected to Holyrood as a Conservative MSP in 2015. Reform UK's policies include scrapping the Curriculum for Excellence, opposition to further lockdowns and getting rid of a number of taxes with the aim of stimulating the economy. What we are concerned about is the move away from integrity and common sense, the move away from policies that have a positive difference, that improve our education system, that increase the benefits to health and address the issues we have in Scotland, such as our drugs problem.""

"Boris Johnson and US Secretary of State Antony Blinken discussed the ""close alignment"" between foreign policy in London and Washington during their meeting earlier, No 10 has said. A No 10 spokeswoman said the PM and Mr Blinken agreed UK-US co-operation would be ""instrumental"" in tackling Covid-19. They also welcomed their nations' joint work on areas like trade and defence. It came as G7 powers met in London for their first face-to-face meetings in over two years. The group is discussing challenges including climate change and threats to human rights. The talks, held amid tight Covid restrictions, will finish on Wednesday. The G7 group - the world's seven largest so-called advanced economies - is made up of the UK, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States. Australia, India, South Korea and South Africa have also been invited as guests, as the UK tries to deepen ties with the Indo-Pacific region. The UK, which currently holds the rotating presidency of the G7, willhost a leaders' summitin Cornwall next month. At their meeting, Mr Johnson and Mr Blinken agreed that UK-US co-operation would be ""instrumental"" in making progress in the fight against coronavirus, alongside ""protecting the environment and other international priorities"", the spokeswoman said. They also agreed that the global rollout of coronavirus vaccines would be key in beating the pandemic, and emphasised the ""importance of G7 work in this area, including efforts to increase international manufacturing capability"". The spokeswoman added that foreign policy issues, including Afghanistan, Iran and China, were also discussed, and Mr Johnson ""looked forward to welcoming"" US President Joe Biden to the UK when he attends the leaders' summit in June - hisfirst overseas trip since his election victory. Rich states want to send 40m more girls to school What is the G7 and what does it do? UK and India agree to let more young people in Earlier, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the summit of foreign ministers ""demonstrates that diplomacy is back"", and showed the importance of ""getting countries together"". Mr Raab, wearing a face mask, welcomed counterparts earlier at Lancaster House in London, with forearm bumps replacing the usual handshakes. After talks on Myanmar on Tuesday morning, the G7 discussed issues including the crisis in Libya and the war in Syria. Politicians kept their distance for the traditional group photo Mr Raab was expected to urge stronger co-operation between the G7 and the guest nations at a working dinner on Tuesday evening. Speaking ahead of the dinner on Tuesday, he told reporters the summit provided a ""good opportunity"" to talk to India, a guest at the summit, about how G7 nations could help the country amid itsspike in Covid cases. This included a chance to seek ""positive answers"" about what developed nations would do with surplus domestic supplies of vaccines, he added. Lancaster House in central London has played host to many historic negotiations, but rarely will it have seen such diplomatic speed dating as it will later. For the next few days, foreign ministers will scurry round the clock from meeting to meeting, doing as much business face to face as they can after months of virtual diplomacy. They will discuss the world's big geopolitical issues: from China to Myanmar, Ethiopia to Ukraine, Syria to the Sahel. The underlying theme will be how they can best organise to defend international rules and open societies against the threat of autocratic regimes. And for the UK, the meeting's host, it's a big test to see if its global foreign policy can live up to its name. The summit comes amid criticism over the UK's decision to cut overseas aid spending from 0.7% of national income to 0.5% - a reduction of more than Â£4bn. Mr Raab said this had been a ""difficult decision"" but that the UK still had scope ""to be an even greater force for good in the world"". On Monday, it was announced that the G7 would use the summit to commit toinvesting $15bn (Â£10.8bn) to help women in developing countries. They are also expected to agree a new target of sending 40 million more girls from low and middle-income countries to school within five years.

"Ione Wells took over BBC Wales News' Instagram to answer your election questions Voters will go to the polls on Thursday to elect the new members of the Welsh Parliament. The election decides who forms the Welsh government, which is in charge of devolved matters including health and social care, education and transport. People have submitted questions about the election to BBC Wales' Westminster correspondent Ione Wells viaInstagram,external, and she has been answering them. Whichever party gets into power will be in charge of Covid restrictions so that could mean some changes to current plans under Welsh Labour. But what we do know is the main parties would like indoor hospitality to reopen on 17 May.

The Tories have been accused by opposition parties in Westminster ofsleazeand not being transparent aboutwho paid for the prime minister's flat renovations.

Updates were brought to you by Doug Faulkner, Alexandra FouchÃ©, Francesca Gillett, Paul Kirby, Alex Therrien, Sophie Williams, James Clarke, Sarah Collerton and Claire Heald. And here's what's been happening around the world: Soon we will be bringing our coronavirus live page to a close for the day. But before we do, here is a round-up of the main UK stories from today: An 85-year-old woman who has not been outdoors for 14 months because of the pandemic has had her first trip out to get an ice cream. Julie Chuter had promised her mum Audrey they would get the biggest ice cream they could find when she took her to Tynemouth earlier. Audrey, who had been desperate to leave her care home, says: ""It's great to be out of the home and be outside, even if the weather is
rubbish! ""I love ice cream, it's my absolute favourite. I had to get one even
though it's cold and wet."" This video can not be played One of the most noticeable changes during the pandemic has been the wearing of face masks. But waste management systems are ""not equipped"" to handle the amount of plastic being thrown away - including from face masks, researchers say. Swansea University scientists say disposable face masks could be releasing chemical pollutants and plastics into the environment. They are calling for better regulation and more research into their disposal. Covid-19 restrictions in County Donegal, and across the Republic of Ireland, are due to ease from 10 May People in
Donegal have been urged not to partake in many of the Republic of Irelandâs post-lockdown
freedoms because of the countyâs high Covid-19 rate. The countryâs Level Five restrictions are being eased from 10 May. But
Chief Medical Officer Dr Tony Holohan says people in Donegal ""will
continue to need to see themselves as having to protect themselves"". It
currently has the highest Covid-19 rate in the country. Last
week the chief medical officer spoke about his concerns about the levels of
non-compliance with Covid-19 restrictions in the county. On
Saturday, the chief medical officer and Irish health minster met with local politicians to discuss the infection rate. Read more here Future lockdowns in the UK are unlikely, a scientist whose modelling led to the first lockdown tells the BBC. Prof Neil Ferguson says the possibility of a further lockdown can't be completely ruled out because of the ""worst case scenario"" of a new variant emerging that evades the current vaccines. In this scenario, it is possible restrictions could be needed again to boost people's immunity to the virus, for example with tweaked vaccines. He says: ""Do I think it's likely to happen? No I don't. I think we are much more likely to be on a steady course now out of this pandemic, at least in this country."" Ferguson says the data on falling covid cases, hospitalisations and deaths is very encouraging. ""With the one caveat that we need to keep to watching those variants carefully and get more data on them, I am actually feeling very optimistic and that optimism has gradually increased as the last three months have unfolded, from a terrible situation we were in in January to a remarkably good situation now."" And he says life will begin to return to normal by early summer. Singapore has announced a series of new restrictions, after cases rose last week and several new clusters - including locally transmitted cases of new variants - emerged on the island. Measures - which kick in from 8 May -  include tighter curbs on social gatherings of five people, stricter border controls, as well as a ban on spectators at sporting events. Travellers arriving from most countries will be required to quarantine for three weeks instead of two. Indoor gyms and fitness studios will be closed, and more people will be required to work from home. These are the tightest local measures since the city-state started easing curbs in the middle of last year
after a partial lockdown. Only last week, it had been deemed the best place in the world to live in Covid times.  Social distancing rules on buses should be relaxed to cater for increased demand, a Scottish operator says. Current Scottish government guidance is for one metre physical distancing between people on all forms of public transport. But independent operator McGill's says the restrictions mean it isnow turning away people at peak times because its buses are full. Transport Scotland says the Scottish government has ""invested significantly"" to ensure public transport services are available during the pandemic and says capacity on public transport will still need to be managed as wider restrictions are eased. McGill's managing director Ralph Roberts says he is worried a ""healthy return"" of passengers will be stymied by the distancing rules not being eased quickly enough. Bus industry sources tell BBC Scotland that a number of operators are nearing capacity at peak times under existing social distancing rules and they fear people will be put off getting back to using buses if the situation worsens. With all the talk today of green lists and European holidays, you may want a reminder of what the rules are. Currently, it is illegal to go abroad for non-essential trips, with the restrictions in place until at least 17 May. Under the proposed ""traffic light"" system, countries will be rated green, amber or red. Countries on thegreen listwill have the fewest travel rules, but you will still need to take a private Covid test in your holiday destination before returning to England and takea private PCR test,externalon or before day two of your arrival in England. But you will not have to isolate unless the test on arrival is positive. Foramber countriesyou will need to take a Covid test before returning to the UK, self-isolate at home for 10 days and pay forPCR Covid testson days two and eight of isolation. Rules will be similar to those already in place forred listcountries and will require you to stay in a hotel for 10 days. You can read more about the ruleshere. As we reported earlier, the Indian Premier League - the richest franchise cricket competition in the world - has beensuspended after several players and staff tested positivefor Covid-19. The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) has no plans to arrange a charter flight for the England contingent in India, as it is the responsibility of the franchises to get the players and staff home. When the players do leave India, they will have to be tested before departure and upon arrival in the UK, and then quarantine in a hotel for 10 days. None of those connected to England are thought to have tested positive for Covid-19, but it is unknown whether any have been in close contact with those who have. An ECB spokesperson says: ""We are in close contact with our players and staff in India as arrangements are put in place for them to return home safely."" England's limited overs captain Eoin Morgan is among the England players who are in India, where he plays for the Kolkata Knight Riders. India's main opposition Congress party has urged the government to declare a nationwide lockdown,as the number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the country passed 20 million.

Demand for Pfizer's Covid vaccine could bolster its revenues for years, the US drugs giant has said. Pfizer said it was expecting ""durable demand"" for the vaccine, in a similar way as for flu vaccines. In the first three months of 2021, the vaccine generated revenues of $3.5bn (Â£2.5bn) as governments scrambled to try to contain the pandemic. Revenue from it is expected to account for more than one third of Pfizer's full-year sales this year. The forecast is based on already-signed contracts for 1.6 billion vaccine doses to be delivered this year. Read more here. The chief medical adviser to US President Joe Biden, Dr Anthony Fauci, has told the BBC that other countries must step up to help India through the current health crisis and to ramp up vaccination rates. ""The number of people needing hospitalisation and not being able to get a hospital bed, the lack of oxygen, the lack of equipment, it is really a very desperate situation. We really need to get a concerted effort of other countries to try and help India out. ""Not only to help them from outside to within, but to help them to be able to get their own situation (under control), namely to produce more vaccines, and to get people vaccinated. ""Only 2% of the population is fully vaccinated and about 9-10% have partial vaccination. For a country of so many  people, we've got to do better than that and we've got to do better than  that quickly, because that's going to be the solution. That's the intermediate and long-range solution."" North Korea
has warned its citizens that vaccines are not a cure-all solution to the Covid
pandemic. It comes
amid indications the reclusive state has failed to secure adequate vaccine
supplies. An editorial in a state newspaper references problems with vaccine programmes
in some countries and says North Korea must uphold its virus restrictions. The country
has not recorded a single case of the virus although last month it processed
24,000 tests. Experts
doubt this claim as the country shares a border with China â a highly used
trade route. Covax â the international vaccine
distribution scheme â has allocated 1.7 million vaccine shots to North Korea. The daily figures also show the number of people to receive both vaccine doses has risen to 15,630,007, while the number to have one jab is 34,667,904. A further 160 patients were admitted into hospital. A further four people have died in the UK within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test, according to thelatest government figures,external. There were 1,946 cases recorded. Yesterday, one death and 1,649 cases were reported.

The duchess will also voice an audio version of her book. The publishers, Penguin Random House, said the book aimed to evoke ""a deep sense of warmth, connection, and compassion"". It added: ""It gives readers a window into shared and enduring moments between a diverse group of fathers and sons - moments of peace and reflection, trust and belief, discovery and learning, and lasting comfort."" The book is the latest in a number of ventures the Sussexes have taken up since their decision to step away from royal duties in 2020 to move to the US and pursue an independent life. The couple have since launched their own charitable foundation, Archewell, and the duchess voiced the Disney nature film, Elephant. Archewell inspired them to begin a podcast of the same name in which they aim to foster wellbeing and kindness. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have recently signed deals with Netflix and Spotify They have also secured commercial contracts thought to be worth millions, including a Netflix deal to produce TV projects and a Spotify deal for podcasts. Their first project for Netflix will focus on the Invictus Games, a competition for injured military personnel and veterans that was championed by the prince. He also recently announced he was joining mental health and life coaching start-up BetterUp as a ""chief impact officer"". The duchess's book is not her first venture into writing.

"European Union leaders are discussing plans for non-essential overseas travel Proposals include allowing anyone who has had their final coronavirus vaccine jab two weeks beforehand to travel Boris Johnson has said the approach to foreign travel this summer will be sensible to avoid ""an influx of disease"" But the NHS app may not initially be available to show someone's covid status for travel, Downing Street says An announcement will be made ""fairly shortly"" but travel will resume when known to be safe, International Trade Secretary Liz Truss says India officially passes 20 million Covid infections but the government says cases are falling The Indian Premier League, the world's richest cricket tournament, has been suspended amid the country's crisis The UK records a further 4 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test and 1,946 lab-confirmed cases In England, care home residents can now leave their home for low-risk trips without having to self-isolate Sarah Collerton, Claire Heald and James Clarke Thanks for following our coverage of the coronavirus pandemic today. Updates were brought to you by Doug Faulkner, Alexandra FouchÃ©, Francesca Gillett, Paul Kirby, Alex Therrien, Sophie Williams, James Clarke, Sarah Collerton and Claire Heald. And here's what's been happening around the world: Soon we will be bringing our coronavirus live page to a close for the day. But before we do, here is a round-up of the main UK stories from today: An 85-year-old woman who has not been outdoors for 14 months because of the pandemic has had her first trip out to get an ice cream. Julie Chuter had promised her mum Audrey they would get the biggest ice cream they could find when she took her to Tynemouth earlier. Audrey, who had been desperate to leave her care home, says: ""It's great to be out of the home and be outside, even if the weather is
rubbish! ""I love ice cream, it's my absolute favourite. I had to get one even
though it's cold and wet."" This video can not be played One of the most noticeable changes during the pandemic has been the wearing of face masks. But waste management systems are ""not equipped"" to handle the amount of plastic being thrown away - including from face masks, researchers say. Swansea University scientists say disposable face masks could be releasing chemical pollutants and plastics into the environment. They are calling for better regulation and more research into their disposal. Covid-19 restrictions in County Donegal, and across the Republic of Ireland, are due to ease from 10 May People in
Donegal have been urged not to partake in many of the Republic of Irelandâs post-lockdown
freedoms because of the countyâs high Covid-19 rate. The countryâs Level Five restrictions are being eased from 10 May. But
Chief Medical Officer Dr Tony Holohan says people in Donegal ""will
continue to need to see themselves as having to protect themselves"". It
currently has the highest Covid-19 rate in the country. Last
week the chief medical officer spoke about his concerns about the levels of
non-compliance with Covid-19 restrictions in the county. On
Saturday, the chief medical officer and Irish health minster met with local politicians to discuss the infection rate. Read more here Future lockdowns in the UK are unlikely, a scientist whose modelling led to the first lockdown tells the BBC. Prof Neil Ferguson says the possibility of a further lockdown can't be completely ruled out because of the ""worst case scenario"" of a new variant emerging that evades the current vaccines. In this scenario, it is possible restrictions could be needed again to boost people's immunity to the virus, for example with tweaked vaccines. He says: ""Do I think it's likely to happen? No I don't. I think we are much more likely to be on a steady course now out of this pandemic, at least in this country."" Ferguson says the data on falling covid cases, hospitalisations and deaths is very encouraging. ""With the one caveat that we need to keep to watching those variants carefully and get more data on them, I am actually feeling very optimistic and that optimism has gradually increased as the last three months have unfolded, from a terrible situation we were in in January to a remarkably good situation now."" And he says life will begin to return to normal by early summer. Singapore has announced a series of new restrictions, after cases rose last week and several new clusters - including locally transmitted cases of new variants - emerged on the island. Measures - which kick in from 8 May -  include tighter curbs on social gatherings of five people, stricter border controls, as well as a ban on spectators at sporting events. Travellers arriving from most countries will be required to quarantine for three weeks instead of two. Indoor gyms and fitness studios will be closed, and more people will be required to work from home. These are the tightest local measures since the city-state started easing curbs in the middle of last year
after a partial lockdown. Only last week, it had been deemed the best place in the world to live in Covid times.  Social distancing rules on buses should be relaxed to cater for increased demand, a Scottish operator says. Current Scottish government guidance is for one metre physical distancing between people on all forms of public transport. But independent operator McGill's says the restrictions mean it isnow turning away people at peak times because its buses are full. Transport Scotland says the Scottish government has ""invested significantly"" to ensure public transport services are available during the pandemic and says capacity on public transport will still need to be managed as wider restrictions are eased. McGill's managing director Ralph Roberts says he is worried a ""healthy return"" of passengers will be stymied by the distancing rules not being eased quickly enough. Bus industry sources tell BBC Scotland that a number of operators are nearing capacity at peak times under existing social distancing rules and they fear people will be put off getting back to using buses if the situation worsens. With all the talk today of green lists and European holidays, you may want a reminder of what the rules are. Currently, it is illegal to go abroad for non-essential trips, with the restrictions in place until at least 17 May. Under the proposed ""traffic light"" system, countries will be rated green, amber or red. Countries on thegreen listwill have the fewest travel rules, but you will still need to take a private Covid test in your holiday destination before returning to England and takea private PCR test,externalon or before day two of your arrival in England. But you will not have to isolate unless the test on arrival is positive. Foramber countriesyou will need to take a Covid test before returning to the UK, self-isolate at home for 10 days and pay forPCR Covid testson days two and eight of isolation. Rules will be similar to those already in place forred listcountries and will require you to stay in a hotel for 10 days. You can read more about the ruleshere. As we reported earlier, the Indian Premier League - the richest franchise cricket competition in the world - has beensuspended after several players and staff tested positivefor Covid-19. The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) has no plans to arrange a charter flight for the England contingent in India, as it is the responsibility of the franchises to get the players and staff home. When the players do leave India, they will have to be tested before departure and upon arrival in the UK, and then quarantine in a hotel for 10 days. None of those connected to England are thought to have tested positive for Covid-19, but it is unknown whether any have been in close contact with those who have. An ECB spokesperson says: ""We are in close contact with our players and staff in India as arrangements are put in place for them to return home safely."" England's limited overs captain Eoin Morgan is among the England players who are in India, where he plays for the Kolkata Knight Riders. India's main opposition Congress party has urged the government to declare a nationwide lockdown,as the number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the country passed 20 million.

Demand for Pfizer's Covid vaccine could bolster its revenues for years, the US drugs giant has said. Pfizer said it was expecting ""durable demand"" for the vaccine, in a similar way as for flu vaccines. In the first three months of 2021, the vaccine generated revenues of $3.5bn (Â£2.5bn) as governments scrambled to try to contain the pandemic. Revenue from it is expected to account for more than one third of Pfizer's full-year sales this year. The forecast is based on already-signed contracts for 1.6 billion vaccine doses to be delivered this year. Read more here. The chief medical adviser to US President Joe Biden, Dr Anthony Fauci, has told the BBC that other countries must step up to help India through the current health crisis and to ramp up vaccination rates. ""The number of people needing hospitalisation and not being able to get a hospital bed, the lack of oxygen, the lack of equipment, it is really a very desperate situation. We really need to get a concerted effort of other countries to try and help India out. ""Not only to help them from outside to within, but to help them to be able to get their own situation (under control), namely to produce more vaccines, and to get people vaccinated. ""Only 2% of the population is fully vaccinated and about 9-10% have partial vaccination. For a country of so many  people, we've got to do better than that and we've got to do better than  that quickly, because that's going to be the solution. That's the intermediate and long-range solution."" North Korea
has warned its citizens that vaccines are not a cure-all solution to the Covid
pandemic. It comes
amid indications the reclusive state has failed to secure adequate vaccine
supplies. An editorial in a state newspaper references problems with vaccine programmes
in some countries and says North Korea must uphold its virus restrictions. The country
has not recorded a single case of the virus although last month it processed
24,000 tests. Experts
doubt this claim as the country shares a border with China â a highly used
trade route. Covax â the international vaccine
distribution scheme â has allocated 1.7 million vaccine shots to North Korea. The daily figures also show the number of people to receive both vaccine doses has risen to 15,630,007, while the number to have one jab is 34,667,904. A further 160 patients were admitted into hospital. A further four people have died in the UK within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test, according to thelatest government figures,external. There were 1,946 cases recorded. Yesterday, one death and 1,649 cases were reported.

The event is part of a government pilot where ticket-holders provided a negative Covid test to be allowed in. Overill said the couple had been fans of Blossoms since they met, and their music is a ""big part of the family"". The vaccine made by drug company Pfizer-BioNTech is set to be authorised for
children and teenagers between the ages of 12 to 15 from this week or early next week, according to US media reports citing government officials. Pfizer has applied for emergency use authorisation for its vaccine, the reports say.

"Sir Jeffrey Donaldson and Edwin Poots are in the running for the DUP leadership The vote to elect the next leader of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) will take place on 14 May, the party has said. Party officers met on Tuesday to discuss the procedure and timetable for the election of both a new leader and deputy leader. Agriculture Minister Edwin Poots and MP Sir Jeffrey Donaldson are bidding to succeed Arlene Foster. She steps down as DUP leaderon 28 May and first minister at the end of June. It is the first time in the party's 50-year history that a leadership contest has taken place. An announcement on the next leader is expected by 17:00 BST on 14 May, the party said. The meeting, to be overseen by party chairman Lord Morrow, will be conducted virtually. The party said contenders for both leader and deputy leader must submit their expression of interest by 17:00 BST on 6 May. The current deputy leader of the party is Lord Dodds. Mr Pootsbegan his leadership bid last Thursday, while Sir Jeffreyannounced his bid on Monday, the 100th anniversary of the formation of Northern Ireland. In a statement on Tuesday evening, Lord Morrow said the date of 14 May was chosen to reflect the fact that Covid restrictions are due to be reviewed at a meeting of the NI Executive on 13 May, and that the Queen's speech will take place in Parliament on 12 May. He said DUP representatives will be required to attend both commitments. ""In accordance with the constitution and rules of the Democratic Unionist Party, only party members, who are also members of the Northern Ireland Assembly and the House of Commons, are entitled to vote for the leader or deputy leader."" There are 28 DUP MLAs (Members of the Legislative Assembly) and eight MPs. South Down DUP MLA Jim Wells, who lost the whip in 2018 after he criticised the party leadership in the media, told BBC News NI he had received the letter that went to all DUP MLAs and MPs on Tuesday evening, informing them about the process for the vote. He said he was ""delighted"" his vote would count and reiterated he would be supporting Mr Poots. Arlene Foster will step down as DUP leader on 28 May Several senior DUP Stormont assembly members and the MP Paul Girvan have declared their support for Mr Poots. Speaking in the Northern Ireland Assembly on Tuesday, the Lagan Valley MLA confirmed he had ""no desire"" to hold the position of first minister should he be elected DUP leader. It is understood he would want to remain agriculture minister. Sir Jeffrey, the MP for Lagan Valley, has the backing of MPs Gavin Robinson and Jim Shannon as well as Education Minister Peter Weir and Junior Minister Gordon Lyons. Campaigners for both contenders claim their candidate has significant support within the party ranks. Sitting in the Stormont chamber on Tuesday, Arlene Foster cut a lonely figure on the benches where she once ruled. She was socially and politically distant from previously loyal supporters who signed a letter of no confidence in her leadership last week, forcing her to quit. Apart for the odd polite smile to those opposite wishing her well for the future, she showed no emotion. First Minister Arlene Foster (in yellow jacket) in the assembly chamber on Tuesday As she exited the chamber, one of the men who wants to replace her as leader entered through another door. Unlike Mrs Foster, Edwin Poots shared the benches with those who have already expressed support for his leadership bid. The contrast was stark. In order to become party leader, a candidate must secure the support of at least 18 of the party's assembly members and MPs. Mrs Fosterannounced her decision to resignafter facing a revolt from DUP members last week. She had led the party since December 2015 and was appointed first minister of Northern Ireland the following month. DUP facing divisive leadership battle BBC News NI understands that she will sever her ties with the DUP when she stands down as first minister, with sources close to her saying she thinks it is no longer the party she joined. Mrs Foster did not take part in a Tuesday morning meeting with her assembly team. The first minister was in the assembly chamber later as Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill responded to questions to the Executive Office.

"This video can not be played Emergency crews attended the collapse late on Monday near the Olivos station on the metro's 12 Line A metro overpass has collapsed in Mexico City as a train was travelling over it, killing at least 23 people, including children, the mayor said. Two train carriages were seen hanging from the structure, above a busy road. At least 79 people were injured, and seven are in a serious condition. One person trapped in a car underneath the wreckage was pulled out alive. This is the deadliest incident in decades in the city's metro system, one of the busiest in the world. Local media broadcast CCTV footage showing the overpass collapsing, sending up clouds of debris. The crash happened at around 22:00 local time on Monday (03:00 GMT) near the Olivos station on the metro's Line 12, in the south-east of the city. Mexico City Mayor Claudia Sheinbaum said an external company would investigate the cause of the incident. Earlier, she said it appeared a girder had given way on the overpass. The line, inaugurated less than a decade ago, will remain closed while a structural survey is carried out. Speaking at a news conference alongside the mayor, President AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador offered his condolences to the relatives of the victims and said that ""nothing would be hidden"" from the Mexican people. Residents had reported cracks in the structure after a deadly 2017 earthquake, according to local media. Mexico's El Universal newspaper says transport authorities made repairs following the reports. The incident happened on Monday night local time The injured were taken to local hospitals A crane was sent to the scene to stabilise the carriages amid concerns they could fall onto the road, which forced officials to temporarily halt rescue efforts at night. In chaotic scenes, anxious friends and relatives of those believed to be on the train gathered in the area. EfraÃ­n JuÃ¡rez told AFP news agency that his son was in the wreckage. ""My daughter-in-law called us. She was with him and she told us the structure fell down over them."" Gisela Rioja Castro, 43, was looking for her 42-year-old husband, who always takes that train after work and had not been answering his phone. She said the authorities had no information about him. ""Nobody knows anything,"" she told the Associated Press. Images show the site of the incident now and in 2019 A passenger, 26-year-old Mariana, told El Universal that she and other people trapped among the carriage's twisted metal managed to escape through a window. ""We only heard a loud thunder, and everything fell apart,"" she said of the moment of the incident. ""There were many people standing and sitting in the carriage, and when the carriage fell, we went flying and hit our heads on its roof."" The search operation had to be paused for some time amid fears of a further collapse The area around the crash site has been sealed off One eyewitness told Mexico's Televisa TV network: ""Suddenly I saw that the structure was shaking."" ""When the dust cleared we ran... to see if we could help. There were no screams. I don't know if they were in shock,"" the witness said. Mexico City's metro system is one of the most used in the world, carrying tens of millions of passengers a week. In North America, only New York's subway carries more people every day. Yet the incident did not occur on one of the older lines, which have been through at least two major earthquakes in the past 35 years. Rather it happened on Line 12, completed as recently as October 2012. There will be difficult questions for the mayor's office to come about the construction of the line, including for several former mayors. They include Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard, who was in office when Line 12 was unveiled and who championed the metro's expansion. He called the accident a ""terrible tragedy"". However, those questions must wait until later. The moment now is solely about the rescue operation as Mexicans pray the number of victims does not rise any further. Last year,one person was killedand more than 40 injured in a collision between two metro trains in Mexico City. In 1975, two underground trains collided, killing 31 people. Were you in the area?

"Politicians are pushing their messages to the voters ahead of the Senedd election on Thursday Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer is visiting seats in north east Wales which fell to the Tories at the last general election Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies will also be in north Wales where the party hopes to repeat its 2019 gains Plaid Cymru's Liz Saville Roberts is also campaigning in key areas of north Wales Welsh Lib Dem leader Jane Dodds will be focusing her attention on mid Wales Natalie Grice, George Herd and Andy Roberts Thanks for following our live coverage of today's campaigning for the Welsh Parliament election on Thursday. We'll be back tomorrow for the final day of the campaign. Join us then. Jane Dodds has been on the campaign trail in Aberaeron, Ceredigion The Welsh Liberal Democrat leader says the response to her party's recovery message is ""really good"". Jane Dodds has been out on the campaign trail in Aberaeron, in Ceredigion. ""Our priority to put recovery first is going down really well on the doorstep,"" she said. ""We are the  party putting recovery first - recovery of the economy, mental health, and recovery for our planet."" The only Lib Dem member of the last Welsh Parliament was Kirsty Williams, who served as education minister in the Labour-led  government and is standing down from her seat of Brecon and Radnorshire after 22 years in the Senedd. ""We are not taking votes for granted,"" insisted Ms Dodds. ""Of course we want  to keep Brecon and Radnorshire, but weâve also always done well in regional seats."" Andrew RT Davies is hoping to take seats off Labour while defending Tory seats against a Plaid Cymru challenge Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies has been out on the doorstep in the Aberconwy constituency - one of the top targets for Plaid Cymru in north Wales. The Tories hold the seat, but held only a 754 vote majority over Plaid in the 2016 Senedd election. They took the seat from Plaid back in 2011 - so this has always been a fiercely contested battle, with a constituency spanning the coastal resort of Llandudno, up to the rural Conwy Valley town of Llanrwst. Last week Prime Minister Boris Johnson stopped off in Llandudno - today, the Welsh leader headed to the region, stating north Wales ""has been too often ignored by Labour"". ""We have a clear plan to tackle our creaking infrastructure and fragile economy, and create jobs, prosperity and opportunity for people across Wales,"" he said. The Wales Green Party is asking Labour voters not to place a
âwasted voteâ for the party on the regional list. âOur focus in the days leading up to the election is getting
out on door steps and on the phone to as many voters as possible, talking about
our plans to transform Wales,â said Anthony Slaughter, the party's leader in Wales. âAnother big priority for us is explaining to traditional
Labour voters that Labour is a wasted vote on the regional list, and that in
almost all of Wales, the last seat on the regional list will be between the
Greens, Abolish and the Tories. âIt makes sense for Labour voters to lend their vote Green
on the regional list,â he added. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Daniel DaviesBBC Wales political correspondent In the three seats Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has been visiting in north Wales today, the party is defending majorities that are smaller than the number of votes polled by UKIP at the last Senedd election five years ago. The biggest study of its kind suggests the vast majority of 2016 UKIP voters went to the Conservatives at the general elections of 2017 and 2019 - you canread more about that here. If those people vote Tory again they could really help the party's Senedd group leader Andrew RT Davies. I spoke to an experienced Labour politician in this part of the world who has been out on the doorsteps during the shortened campaign. She sounded confident Labour's vote was holding up. But that may not tell you much about what is happening at the other end of the spectrum, where the Conservatives are trying to convince people to keep up the habit of voting Tory. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has been on the campaign trail in Wales Jamie Jenkins from Reform UK says the latest figures show low Covid rates ""are not leading to any real impact on hospitalisations"". The former Brexit Party says there should be no more lockdowns, claiming they have a devastating effect on the economy. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Parties are using targeted social media advertising to appeal to voters both across Wales and in specific areas. BBC Wales' Westminster correspondent Ione Wells explains. Adam Price thinks voters want 'a new direction' from someone else Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price has been campaigning in Neath, a seat in south Wales held by Labour in Cardiff Bay since devolution in 1999 and for more than a century at Westminster. But he said that in the last few days before polling day, people were ""making a decision now as families, and particularly traditional Labour voters, say they're coming over to Plaid because they feel it's time to give someone else a chance to take Wales in that new direction, with new ideas and new leadership that puts us on a different path"". Mr Price said Plaid Cymru would ""deliver opportunity for our young people, dignity for old people and give everyone in Wales the chance for a better life"". ""People are really inspired, I think, by our positive message of hope and change and belief in Wales, there's no problem in Wales that Wales cannot solve,"" he said. ""But we've got to believe in our own ability to change things, and that starts with the election of a Plaid Cymru government in a few days' time."" As the posters show, Neath has been a Labour stronghold for a century As well as the Welsh Parliament or Senedd election, you will also get the chance to vote for your local police and crime commissioner this Thursday.

Carwyn Jones was first minister from 2009 to 2018 Former first minister Carwyn Jones has suggested that any
post-election coalition deal in Wales should take âa few weeksâ to agree. Mr Jones took over from Rhodri Morgan as first minister in 2009, when Labour
was already running the Welsh government in coalition with Plaid
Cymru. Labour governed alone after making gains in the 2011
election, but after the 2016 poll Lib Dem Kirsty Williams and former Plaid
Cymru leader Lord Elis-Thomas joined his administration. There is speculation that a new coalition could be needed if
Labour loses ground in Thursdayâs election, although Plaid Cymru have ruled out
a âsimple re-runâ of 2007-11 when they were the junior partner. Mr Jones told BBC Radio Walesâ The Leadersâ Lounge: âOnce everyone sees the numbers, everyone will be making
calculations, then there will be a game of chicken â who rings who first? 
And then the advisers will speak to each other first and prepare the
ground.  All that can happen in a situation like this."" Asked how long talks might take, he said: âExpect a few
weeks. ""If you have coalition negotiations, my view has always been you
have to have as much detail as possible in a coalition agreement. ""In
2007, we had a very detailed coalition agreement with Plaid, which meant that
really there wasnât much argument within that coalition â there was the odd
disagreement here and there but nothing public because everybody knew the
detail of the agreement. âIn 2010, the Tory-Lib Dem coalition [UK government] â I remember saying at
the time this is not a very detailed agreement, this is a recipe for people to
interpret it in different ways, and a recipe for chaos, and that âs the way it turned
out, to my eyes. âIf there is going to be a coalition  - nobody knows
that â best that it takes a few weeks to put together with a detailed agreement
than signing a piece of paper thatâs one side of A4.â Mr Jones stood down as first minister in 2018, and was standing down as MS for Bridgend at this election. You can hear more from him onThe Leadersâ Loungeon BBC Radio Wales at 1830 BST on Tuesday, and on BBC Sounds. Sir Keir Starmer (l) at Excelitas Technologies in St Asaph, Vale of Clwyd UK Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer emphasised the leadership
of his Welsh colleague Mark Drakeford on his visit to north Wales. Sir Keir visited Excelitas Technologies in St Asaph, in the
Vale of Clwyd â a seat the Conservatives won in Westminster at the 2019
general election. The company makes lenses and hi-tech goggles for the
military. The Labour leader told BBC Wales: âIt's very important to
reflect on Mark Drakeford and the way he has led Wales over the last 14 months
during this pandemic. âVery many people recognise that careful, reassuring way in
which he has led Wales through to a position now where the virus level is lower
in Wales than anywhere across the UK, third in the world on vaccines.â He said he and Mr Drakeford both want âmore power and
responsibility in Wales, decisions closer to people in Wales, a strong Wales in
a fair United Kingdomâ. He did not answer a question about whether he would be happy
with a deal with Plaid Cymru after the election directly. âWhat weâre fighting for is a Labour-led Welsh government to
continue the good work that has been done through the pandemic and lead us
through the recovery,"" he said. And asked whether it was the case that the allegations
against the prime minister were not cutting through with voters, Sir Keir said:
âI don't actually go along with this argument that says, well it's priced in it
may be that the prime minister is not being straight, but it doesn't really
matter. âBeing the prime minister of the United Kingdom is an
honour, itâs a privilege, and we should not ever accept that it's priced that
there should be sleaze."" Vaughan Gething (top right) took part in a discussion on Politics Live Wales' Health Minister Vaughan Gething has
called on the UK government to remain cautious as it prepares to open up
foreign travel in England. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has indicated
there will be some ""opening up"" of foreign travel on 17 May - but
said it was important to be cautious. Speaking on BBC Politics Live, Mr Gething
said there was ""nervousness about significantly liberalising international
travel in the middle of May"" amongst all four governments in the UK. ""The reality is, we know last
summer we reimported coronavirus into all parts of UK with foreign travel. ""The risks are not just about Covid
case rates increasing again but of the new variants of coronavirus that are
circulating in Europe and other parts of the world, and those may potentially
escape the vaccination response. âI understand it's difficult, but it's the
right thing to do to be cautious and avoid the potential harm that could come
if we do have coronavirus imported. ""Because if international travel starts
in England it affects all other part of the UK as well."" More details are expected this week to
confirm when and how international travel will restart in England. Neil Hamilton was the only remaining UKIP Senedd member UKIP Wales leader Neil Hamilton is campaigning in Merthyr
Tydfil today. A spokesman said the party was âstanding on a platform of
decency, honesty and fairnessâ. âTwenty two years of Labour government has devastated Wales and left
behind communities in the south Wales valleys and north Wales,â the spokesman
added. UKIP won seven seats at the last Welsh Assembly election in
2016. After a series of defections Mr Hamilton remained the only UKIP Senedd
member in the last term. There has never been a Welsh assembly election which has prompted half or more of the population to vote. The height came in the first election in 1999, with 46%.

Ione Wells took over BBC Wales News' Instagram to answer your election questions Voters go to the polls on Thursday to elect the new members of the Welsh Parliament. The election decides who forms the Welsh government, which is in charge of devolved matters including health and social care, education and transport. People have submitted questions about the election to BBC Wales' Westminster correspondent Ione Wells via Instagram. You can read the answers here. James Wells says there is ""no longer any serious pressure"" on the NHS in Wales from Covid Reform UK - previously known as the Brexit Party - has accused Welsh Labour of âdithering and delayingâ in easing Covid restrictions. The party, which says it will never hold another lockdown, said it is focused on reopening the economy. âWales is paying the costs,â said Reformâs James Wells. âYesterday one person with Covid died in the UK - in Wales there is no longer any serious pressure on the NHS from Covid. ""Total deaths in Wales over the past four weeks have been around 12% lower than you would expect for this time of year so why are so many sectors still not fully open? âEach day the cost of keeping business from fully reopening grows with a total bill from furlough alone around Â£2bn in Wales. ""Job losses are also contributing to the growing mental health crisis. This simply isnât good enough.â Reform UK are standing in a number of seats across Wales including all the regional lists.

postal voting papers, despite having requested them weeks ago. The local authority says itâs
also been contacted by several electoral candidates, who raised the issue. It is asking anyone
who has not yet received their papers to contact its election team as quickly
as possible. The council does not yet know how many papers are missing. There was also a delay in sending out postal votes in Sheffield, with 15,000 going out over the Bank Holiday weekend. People are being encouraged to return the ballots on the day they arrive. The Electoral Commission said it was aware some councils had reported printing issues and it was supporting them to have everything in place before polls open on Thursday. Completed postal votes must be returned by the close of voting at 10pm on Thursday. Those who have not managed to send their ballots back can hand them in at their local polling station. Philip SimBBC Scotland political correspondent With two days to go until the Holyrood election, there seems to be little mystery about the final result - with only the SNP talking about forming a government. But there are still some key questions to be answered, which could have a huge bearing on Scotland's future. Will the SNP secure an outright majority? Could they build a pro-independence majority with the help of other, smaller parties? Will the Conservatives hold off a Labour challenge in the battle for second place? And what are the factors which could help answer these questions? Five key factors could determine the answers to these critical questions: Read Philip's full analysis of these questionshere. Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey has been campaigning in Edinburgh today. He said Covid had reminded everyone just how important local community is and his party was offering ""local champions"" in these elections. He added that people appreciate their local green spaces more than ever and the Lib Dems had put the environment at the heart of their campaign. Sir Ed said: ""The Liberal Democrat environment record in local government is unbeatable, whether it's delivering the country's first clean air zone outside of London to topping the country's leader board for recycling rates.""

Almost 700 libraries have closed across Britain since 2010 as councils look at ways to save money, but in Middlesbrough they are spending more. It is thought almost one in 10 children in the town do not own a book and it has a problem with literacy. Mother-of-three Nisha Mayuran, who is originally from Sri Lanka, has made it her family home. Ahead of Thursday's local elections across England , she explains how important the library is to her and her children.  Journalist: Chris Robinson, filmed and edited: Chris Middis Labour's Sadiq Khan is on course for a second term as London mayor, the latest opinion poll suggests, although his likely margin of victory could be narrower than previously predicted. For much of the campaign, pollsters have been suggesting Mr Khan could win on the first round of ballots, with more than 50% of first preference votes, under theSupplementary Vote,externalsystem used in the contest. A new poll by Opinium suggests Mr Khan will not get more than 50% of first preference votes, but he will get 63% of the vote after second preferences have been counted. According to Opinium, crime has now overtaken the NHS as the most important issue for Londoners. This is the only topic they've polled on where the Conservative candidate, Shaun Bailey, has a slight lead over Mr Khan. The Liberal Democrats and Greens are in a close contest for third and fourth places, according to the poll. The survey was of 1,005 London adults over 18, between 28 April to 3 May. Question from Paul Hodson, Buckingham Parish councils control millions of pounds in public funds, and influence our day-to-day lives. On 6 May, people across England will vote in local authority elections.

government is due to set out its law-making priorities for the next year on
Tuesday next week, when the Queen will officially open the next annual
""session"" at the State Opening of Parliament. There have been reports that the speech will contain an ambition to reform the sector. But nothing has been officially announced as things stand.

We've produceda very simple guideto all the different elections so you know what is happening in your area and across the country. It's been suggest the brownies (not these ones) were in a box that read 'Vote Labour'. Police are investigating claims the Labour candidate for
West Yorkshire Mayor has broken election laws. There are allegations Tracy Brabin broke the law by
offering people brownies. A Lib Dem Councillor, Tom Gordon, tweeted it was the ""second time in as many days"" he had seen Ms Brabin  ""out and about with boxes of brownies on them that say  ""Vote Labour"" on them"". Labour says the cakes were offered to party members after
they had been campaigning â which would not be against the rules. The Electoral Commission says there is only a breach of the law if there is âcorrupt intentâ and it does not apply to
hospitality. Question from James in London The 2014 independence referendum was underpinned by a so-called section 30 order, under which Westminster gave the Scottish Parliament the power to carry out the vote. The SNP says,externalit will seek this power again if this month's Scottish Parliament elections produce a majority in favour of holding a new referendum. The party says if this request is rebuffed, it would pass a bill to hold a new referendum and it would be up to the UK government to challenge it in the courts. The UK government maintains that votes on constitutional matters require the prior agreement of Westminster. Question from Maxone in London In Greater London, the elected mayor is responsible for policing and has the same responsibilities as police and crime commissioners do in other areas. The role of a
PCC in London is carried out by the mayorâs appointed deputy for policing and
crime. The mayor also appoints the Metropolitan Police commissioner, who is in charge of the day-to-day running of the force and holds them to account.

But like many of its neighbours, it is starting to turn blue: it already has two Tory MPs, and the council is run by a minority Conservative administration. For Radio Four's World at One,BBC political reporter Rob Mayor,externalhas been finding out what people think of the upcoming elections: Council leader Patrick Harley is hoping to win a Conservative majority on Thursday. He says it will allow the town to attract investment from central government, as it has been doing for the last few years. But leader of the Labour group, Cllr Qadar Zada, says unemployment is ""up by 75%"" during the pandemic, with 20,000 young people out of work. Residents are also worried about crime, he says. Wendy Farmer, who has run a stall in the town's market for 30 years, says trade has fallen as all the big shops have closed. The council has not helped during the pandemic, she says. But she supports the prime minister. ""Those that criticise, I'd like to see them them do what he's had to put up with in the last 12 months,"" she says. A full list of all the candidate standing in the area can be found here,external. Question from James Georgeson in South Lanarkshire The pandemic has had a serious impact oncampaigning in Scotland,external, but things have become a bit easier for the parties as some restrictions have been lifted. Leafleting was allowed from 15 March, with campaigners allowed to do face-to-face doorstep canvassing in most areas of Scotland from 12 April, and most campaigners had to remain in their local areas until 1 May. Campaigning was also paused followingthe death of Prince Philip. Question from Gabriel Beck in Eastbourne Because the pandemic will delay vote-counting (see our post earlier), the BBC's results programme will begin later than usual at 09.00 BST on Friday on the BBC News Channel, BBC Two and the BBC iPlayer. It will also be shown on BBC One in the afternoon. Huw Edwards and Kirsty Wark will lead the show, which will be co-hosted from London and Edinburgh. Special coverage will continue on Saturday from 13.15 BST to 22.00 BST. The BBC News website will have all the results as they are announced, with live results, and live pages with the latest reaction and analysis from our correspondents. With just two days to go until polling day, some of the party leaders have been on the campaign trail. We have not seen Boris Johnson on any election visits today because he has been doing avirtual meeting with the Indian PM. Here's what we have learned so far:  Question from Ruth Yarwood in Anglesey Counting will be unusual this year because of the Covid pandemic, and will last several days. Some counts, like the Hartlepool by-election, will take place overnight on Thursday. We will know all the results for the Welsh Senedd on Friday. Scotland starts counting in some areas on Friday but there won't be a final result until Saturday, or possibly even Sunday. English councils are spread over four days from Thursday night until Sunday. A dozen of the Police and Crime Commissioner elections in England won't count until Monday. Question from Finn in Tunbridge Wells If you are worried about your completed postal vote not arriving in time, you can hand it in at your local polling station before voting closes at 22.00 BST on Thursday. Alternatively, you can take it to your local electoral registration office before it closes on Thursday. Â© 2025 BBC.

And here's what's been happening around the world: Soon we will be bringing our coronavirus live page to a close for the day. But before we do, here is a round-up of the main UK stories from today: An 85-year-old woman who has not been outdoors for 14 months because of the pandemic has had her first trip out to get an ice cream. Julie Chuter had promised her mum Audrey they would get the biggest ice cream they could find when she took her to Tynemouth earlier. Audrey, who had been desperate to leave her care home, says: ""It's great to be out of the home and be outside, even if the weather is
rubbish! ""I love ice cream, it's my absolute favourite. I had to get one even
though it's cold and wet."" This video can not be played One of the most noticeable changes during the pandemic has been the wearing of face masks. But waste management systems are ""not equipped"" to handle the amount of plastic being thrown away - including from face masks, researchers say. Swansea University scientists say disposable face masks could be releasing chemical pollutants and plastics into the environment. They are calling for better regulation and more research into their disposal. Covid-19 restrictions in County Donegal, and across the Republic of Ireland, are due to ease from 10 May People in
Donegal have been urged not to partake in many of the Republic of Irelandâs post-lockdown
freedoms because of the countyâs high Covid-19 rate. The countryâs Level Five restrictions are being eased from 10 May. But
Chief Medical Officer Dr Tony Holohan says people in Donegal ""will
continue to need to see themselves as having to protect themselves"". It
currently has the highest Covid-19 rate in the country. Last
week the chief medical officer spoke about his concerns about the levels of
non-compliance with Covid-19 restrictions in the county. On
Saturday, the chief medical officer and Irish health minster met with local politicians to discuss the infection rate. Read more here Future lockdowns in the UK are unlikely, a scientist whose modelling led to the first lockdown tells the BBC. Prof Neil Ferguson says the possibility of a further lockdown can't be completely ruled out because of the ""worst case scenario"" of a new variant emerging that evades the current vaccines. In this scenario, it is possible restrictions could be needed again to boost people's immunity to the virus, for example with tweaked vaccines. He says: ""Do I think it's likely to happen? No I don't. I think we are much more likely to be on a steady course now out of this pandemic, at least in this country."" Ferguson says the data on falling covid cases, hospitalisations and deaths is very encouraging. ""With the one caveat that we need to keep to watching those variants carefully and get more data on them, I am actually feeling very optimistic and that optimism has gradually increased as the last three months have unfolded, from a terrible situation we were in in January to a remarkably good situation now."" And he says life will begin to return to normal by early summer. Singapore has announced a series of new restrictions, after cases rose last week and several new clusters - including locally transmitted cases of new variants - emerged on the island. Measures - which kick in from 8 May -  include tighter curbs on social gatherings of five people, stricter border controls, as well as a ban on spectators at sporting events. Travellers arriving from most countries will be required to quarantine for three weeks instead of two. Indoor gyms and fitness studios will be closed, and more people will be required to work from home. These are the tightest local measures since the city-state started easing curbs in the middle of last year
after a partial lockdown. Only last week, it had been deemed the best place in the world to live in Covid times.  Social distancing rules on buses should be relaxed to cater for increased demand, a Scottish operator says. Current Scottish government guidance is for one metre physical distancing between people on all forms of public transport. But independent operator McGill's says the restrictions mean it isnow turning away people at peak times because its buses are full. Transport Scotland says the Scottish government has ""invested significantly"" to ensure public transport services are available during the pandemic and says capacity on public transport will still need to be managed as wider restrictions are eased. McGill's managing director Ralph Roberts says he is worried a ""healthy return"" of passengers will be stymied by the distancing rules not being eased quickly enough. Bus industry sources tell BBC Scotland that a number of operators are nearing capacity at peak times under existing social distancing rules and they fear people will be put off getting back to using buses if the situation worsens. With all the talk today of green lists and European holidays, you may want a reminder of what the rules are. Currently, it is illegal to go abroad for non-essential trips, with the restrictions in place until at least 17 May. Under the proposed ""traffic light"" system, countries will be rated green, amber or red. Countries on thegreen listwill have the fewest travel rules, but you will still need to take a private Covid test in your holiday destination before returning to England and takea private PCR test,externalon or before day two of your arrival in England. But you will not have to isolate unless the test on arrival is positive. Foramber countriesyou will need to take a Covid test before returning to the UK, self-isolate at home for 10 days and pay forPCR Covid testson days two and eight of isolation. Rules will be similar to those already in place forred listcountries and will require you to stay in a hotel for 10 days. You can read more about the ruleshere. As we reported earlier, the Indian Premier League - the richest franchise cricket competition in the world - has beensuspended after several players and staff tested positivefor Covid-19. The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) has no plans to arrange a charter flight for the England contingent in India, as it is the responsibility of the franchises to get the players and staff home. When the players do leave India, they will have to be tested before departure and upon arrival in the UK, and then quarantine in a hotel for 10 days. None of those connected to England are thought to have tested positive for Covid-19, but it is unknown whether any have been in close contact with those who have. An ECB spokesperson says: ""We are in close contact with our players and staff in India as arrangements are put in place for them to return home safely."" England's limited overs captain Eoin Morgan is among the England players who are in India, where he plays for the Kolkata Knight Riders.

Demand for Pfizer's Covid vaccine could bolster its revenues for years, the US drugs giant has said. Pfizer said it was expecting ""durable demand"" for the vaccine, in a similar way as for flu vaccines. In the first three months of 2021, the vaccine generated revenues of $3.5bn (Â£2.5bn) as governments scrambled to try to contain the pandemic. Revenue from it is expected to account for more than one third of Pfizer's full-year sales this year. The forecast is based on already-signed contracts for 1.6 billion vaccine doses to be delivered this year. Read more here. The chief medical adviser to US President Joe Biden, Dr Anthony Fauci, has told the BBC that other countries must step up to help India through the current health crisis and to ramp up vaccination rates. ""The number of people needing hospitalisation and not being able to get a hospital bed, the lack of oxygen, the lack of equipment, it is really a very desperate situation. We really need to get a concerted effort of other countries to try and help India out. ""Not only to help them from outside to within, but to help them to be able to get their own situation (under control), namely to produce more vaccines, and to get people vaccinated. ""Only 2% of the population is fully vaccinated and about 9-10% have partial vaccination. For a country of so many  people, we've got to do better than that and we've got to do better than  that quickly, because that's going to be the solution. That's the intermediate and long-range solution."" North Korea
has warned its citizens that vaccines are not a cure-all solution to the Covid
pandemic. It comes
amid indications the reclusive state has failed to secure adequate vaccine
supplies. An editorial in a state newspaper references problems with vaccine programmes
in some countries and says North Korea must uphold its virus restrictions. The country
has not recorded a single case of the virus although last month it processed
24,000 tests. Experts
doubt this claim as the country shares a border with China â a highly used
trade route. Covax â the international vaccine
distribution scheme â has allocated 1.7 million vaccine shots to North Korea. The daily figures also show the number of people to receive both vaccine doses has risen to 15,630,007, while the number to have one jab is 34,667,904. A further 160 patients were admitted into hospital. A further four people have died in the UK within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test, according to thelatest government figures,external. There were 1,946 cases recorded. Yesterday, one death and 1,649 cases were reported.

Updates were brought to you by Doug Faulkner, Alexandra FouchÃ©, Francesca Gillett, Paul Kirby, Alex Therrien, Sophie Williams, James Clarke, Sarah Collerton and Claire Heald. And here's what's been happening around the world: Soon we will be bringing our coronavirus live page to a close for the day. But before we do, here is a round-up of the main UK stories from today: An 85-year-old woman who has not been outdoors for 14 months because of the pandemic has had her first trip out to get an ice cream. Julie Chuter had promised her mum Audrey they would get the biggest ice cream they could find when she took her to Tynemouth earlier. Audrey, who had been desperate to leave her care home, says: ""It's great to be out of the home and be outside, even if the weather is
rubbish! ""I love ice cream, it's my absolute favourite. I had to get one even
though it's cold and wet."" This video can not be played One of the most noticeable changes during the pandemic has been the wearing of face masks. But waste management systems are ""not equipped"" to handle the amount of plastic being thrown away - including from face masks, researchers say. Swansea University scientists say disposable face masks could be releasing chemical pollutants and plastics into the environment. They are calling for better regulation and more research into their disposal. Covid-19 restrictions in County Donegal, and across the Republic of Ireland, are due to ease from 10 May People in
Donegal have been urged not to partake in many of the Republic of Irelandâs post-lockdown
freedoms because of the countyâs high Covid-19 rate. The countryâs Level Five restrictions are being eased from 10 May. But
Chief Medical Officer Dr Tony Holohan says people in Donegal ""will
continue to need to see themselves as having to protect themselves"". It
currently has the highest Covid-19 rate in the country. Last
week the chief medical officer spoke about his concerns about the levels of
non-compliance with Covid-19 restrictions in the county. On
Saturday, the chief medical officer and Irish health minster met with local politicians to discuss the infection rate. Read more here Future lockdowns in the UK are unlikely, a scientist whose modelling led to the first lockdown tells the BBC. Prof Neil Ferguson says the possibility of a further lockdown can't be completely ruled out because of the ""worst case scenario"" of a new variant emerging that evades the current vaccines. In this scenario, it is possible restrictions could be needed again to boost people's immunity to the virus, for example with tweaked vaccines. He says: ""Do I think it's likely to happen? No I don't. I think we are much more likely to be on a steady course now out of this pandemic, at least in this country."" Ferguson says the data on falling covid cases, hospitalisations and deaths is very encouraging. ""With the one caveat that we need to keep to watching those variants carefully and get more data on them, I am actually feeling very optimistic and that optimism has gradually increased as the last three months have unfolded, from a terrible situation we were in in January to a remarkably good situation now."" And he says life will begin to return to normal by early summer. Singapore has announced a series of new restrictions, after cases rose last week and several new clusters - including locally transmitted cases of new variants - emerged on the island. Measures - which kick in from 8 May -  include tighter curbs on social gatherings of five people, stricter border controls, as well as a ban on spectators at sporting events. Travellers arriving from most countries will be required to quarantine for three weeks instead of two. Indoor gyms and fitness studios will be closed, and more people will be required to work from home. These are the tightest local measures since the city-state started easing curbs in the middle of last year
after a partial lockdown. Only last week, it had been deemed the best place in the world to live in Covid times.  Social distancing rules on buses should be relaxed to cater for increased demand, a Scottish operator says. Current Scottish government guidance is for one metre physical distancing between people on all forms of public transport. But independent operator McGill's says the restrictions mean it isnow turning away people at peak times because its buses are full. Transport Scotland says the Scottish government has ""invested significantly"" to ensure public transport services are available during the pandemic and says capacity on public transport will still need to be managed as wider restrictions are eased. McGill's managing director Ralph Roberts says he is worried a ""healthy return"" of passengers will be stymied by the distancing rules not being eased quickly enough. Bus industry sources tell BBC Scotland that a number of operators are nearing capacity at peak times under existing social distancing rules and they fear people will be put off getting back to using buses if the situation worsens. With all the talk today of green lists and European holidays, you may want a reminder of what the rules are. Currently, it is illegal to go abroad for non-essential trips, with the restrictions in place until at least 17 May. Under the proposed ""traffic light"" system, countries will be rated green, amber or red. Countries on thegreen listwill have the fewest travel rules, but you will still need to take a private Covid test in your holiday destination before returning to England and takea private PCR test,externalon or before day two of your arrival in England. But you will not have to isolate unless the test on arrival is positive. Foramber countriesyou will need to take a Covid test before returning to the UK, self-isolate at home for 10 days and pay forPCR Covid testson days two and eight of isolation. Rules will be similar to those already in place forred listcountries and will require you to stay in a hotel for 10 days. You can read more about the ruleshere. As we reported earlier, the Indian Premier League - the richest franchise cricket competition in the world - has beensuspended after several players and staff tested positivefor Covid-19. The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) has no plans to arrange a charter flight for the England contingent in India, as it is the responsibility of the franchises to get the players and staff home. When the players do leave India, they will have to be tested before departure and upon arrival in the UK, and then quarantine in a hotel for 10 days. None of those connected to England are thought to have tested positive for Covid-19, but it is unknown whether any have been in close contact with those who have. An ECB spokesperson says: ""We are in close contact with our players and staff in India as arrangements are put in place for them to return home safely."" England's limited overs captain Eoin Morgan is among the England players who are in India, where he plays for the Kolkata Knight Riders. India's main opposition Congress party has urged the government to declare a nationwide lockdown,as the number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the country passed 20 million.

Demand for Pfizer's Covid vaccine could bolster its revenues for years, the US drugs giant has said. Pfizer said it was expecting ""durable demand"" for the vaccine, in a similar way as for flu vaccines. In the first three months of 2021, the vaccine generated revenues of $3.5bn (Â£2.5bn) as governments scrambled to try to contain the pandemic. Revenue from it is expected to account for more than one third of Pfizer's full-year sales this year. The forecast is based on already-signed contracts for 1.6 billion vaccine doses to be delivered this year. Read more here. The chief medical adviser to US President Joe Biden, Dr Anthony Fauci, has told the BBC that other countries must step up to help India through the current health crisis and to ramp up vaccination rates. ""The number of people needing hospitalisation and not being able to get a hospital bed, the lack of oxygen, the lack of equipment, it is really a very desperate situation. We really need to get a concerted effort of other countries to try and help India out. ""Not only to help them from outside to within, but to help them to be able to get their own situation (under control), namely to produce more vaccines, and to get people vaccinated. ""Only 2% of the population is fully vaccinated and about 9-10% have partial vaccination. For a country of so many  people, we've got to do better than that and we've got to do better than  that quickly, because that's going to be the solution. That's the intermediate and long-range solution."" North Korea
has warned its citizens that vaccines are not a cure-all solution to the Covid
pandemic. It comes
amid indications the reclusive state has failed to secure adequate vaccine
supplies. An editorial in a state newspaper references problems with vaccine programmes
in some countries and says North Korea must uphold its virus restrictions. The country
has not recorded a single case of the virus although last month it processed
24,000 tests. Experts
doubt this claim as the country shares a border with China â a highly used
trade route. Covax â the international vaccine
distribution scheme â has allocated 1.7 million vaccine shots to North Korea. The daily figures also show the number of people to receive both vaccine doses has risen to 15,630,007, while the number to have one jab is 34,667,904. A further 160 patients were admitted into hospital. A further four people have died in the UK within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test, according to thelatest government figures,external. There were 1,946 cases recorded. Yesterday, one death and 1,649 cases were reported.

"Calls for a second national lockdown have also come from business leaders and health experts India's main opposition party has called for a full national lockdown, shortly after the country passed more than 20 million Covid-19 infections. There has been a ""virtual collapse of health services"" and a lockdown is needed to ""break the chain"", a spokesman for the Congress party said. The prime minister is resisting the move due to the economic impact. India added more than 355,000 cases on Tuesday, down from more than 400,000 daily infections on 30 April. Cases are ""slowing down"", the government said, but testing numbers have also dipped meaning the true caseload could be far higher. India's Covid crisis: Your questions answered Deadly second wave spreads from cities to small towns Backlash after China Weibo post mocks India Covid crisis ""We are now forced - there is no option - [we] will have to resort to a national lockdown to break the chain, to restore some order in the health services,"" Pawan Khera, a spokesman for the opposition Congress party told the BBC on Tuesday.

Calls for a second national lockdown have also come from business leaders, international health experts and other senior politicians. Members of India's Covid-19 taskforce, which advises the central government, are ""pushing hard"" for a two-week lockdown, The Indian Express reported. Dr Anthony Fauci, America's top public health expert, described the situation as ""extremely serious"" and said a nationwide lockdown was needed alongside a massive vaccination drive and the construction of makeshift hospitals. The decision to impose restrictions in India is made by individual state authorities rather than the central government. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has said that states should only consider restrictions as ""a last option"". But many states have still introduced restrictions. The northern state of Bihar is the latest to have announced a full lockdown while the capital, Delhi, and the financial hub, Mumbai, are also under restrictions. Prime Minister Modi was heavily criticised last year for imposing a nationwide lockdown with less than four hours' notice. It caused a  humanitarian crisis as tens of thousands of migrant workers were left without work and forced to walk hundreds of kilometres to their home villages. Locked down India struggles as workers flee cities India's PM seeks 'forgiveness' over virus lockdown The lockdown also saw India's economic output fall by a record 24% between April and June 2020 compared to the same period a year earlier, and the government has said another national lockdown would have dire consequences for the economy. India's second wave has been fuelled by lax safety protocols and massive public festivals and election rallies. It has overwhelmed its hospitals and delays in testing, diagnosis and treatment - as well as a shortage of critical care beds and crucial drugs - have resulted in a spike in deaths. The country has so far reported more than 222,000 deaths due to the virus. But experts say India's Covid death toll is vastly under-reported. There have been very long lines at crematoriums, mass funeral pyres and cities running out of space to bury or cremate the dead. India's cases have risen over the past week, but at a slower rate than in previous weeks. And daily cases have fallen in Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra which are all hotspots of the crisis. Erratic testing, however, makes it hard to gauge the significance of these numbers. Insufficient testing has proved to be another issue. Health officials said there was ""cautious hope"" of some respite from the second wave. But Lav Agarwal, joint secretary of the health ministry, said progress needed to be sustained by ""containment measures at district and state level"". Experts have also said other hotspots are likely to emerge in the coming weeks as the pandemic moves through the country. Meanwhile, an oxygen shortage has shown no signs of abating and people in several hotspot cities, including Delhi, are struggling for treatment. A sluggish vaccination campaign has compounded the crisis. Since January, India has administered more than 157 million vaccine doses which ranks third in the world after China and the United States. But just over 10% of India's 1.4 billion people have had one dose and only about 2% have received both doses. Despite being the world's biggest producer of vaccines, India is facing a shortage of supplies. And vaccination rates are down. The chief executive of India's Serum Institute, the world's biggest vaccine manufacturer,has warned shortages will last for months,external.

postal voting papers, despite having requested them weeks ago. The local authority says itâs
also been contacted by several electoral candidates, who raised the issue. It is asking anyone
who has not yet received their papers to contact its election team as quickly
as possible. The council does not yet know how many papers are missing. There was also a delay in sending out postal votes in Sheffield, with 15,000 going out over the Bank Holiday weekend. People are being encouraged to return the ballots on the day they arrive. The Electoral Commission said it was aware some councils had reported printing issues and it was supporting them to have everything in place before polls open on Thursday. Completed postal votes must be returned by the close of voting at 10pm on Thursday. Those who have not managed to send their ballots back can hand them in at their local polling station. Philip SimBBC Scotland political correspondent With two days to go until the Holyrood election, there seems to be little mystery about the final result - with only the SNP talking about forming a government. But there are still some key questions to be answered, which could have a huge bearing on Scotland's future. Will the SNP secure an outright majority? Could they build a pro-independence majority with the help of other, smaller parties? Will the Conservatives hold off a Labour challenge in the battle for second place? And what are the factors which could help answer these questions? Five key factors could determine the answers to these critical questions: Read Philip's full analysis of these questionshere. Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey has been campaigning in Edinburgh today.

Journalist: Chris Robinson, filmed and edited: Chris Middis Labour's Sadiq Khan is on course for a second term as London mayor, the latest opinion poll suggests, although his likely margin of victory could be narrower than previously predicted. For much of the campaign, pollsters have been suggesting Mr Khan could win on the first round of ballots, with more than 50% of first preference votes, under theSupplementary Vote,externalsystem used in the contest. A new poll by Opinium suggests Mr Khan will not get more than 50% of first preference votes, but he will get 63% of the vote after second preferences have been counted. According to Opinium, crime has now overtaken the NHS as the most important issue for Londoners. This is the only topic they've polled on where the Conservative candidate, Shaun Bailey, has a slight lead over Mr Khan.

Question from James in London The 2014 independence referendum was underpinned by a so-called section 30 order, under which Westminster gave the Scottish Parliament the power to carry out the vote. The SNP says,externalit will seek this power again if this month's Scottish Parliament elections produce a majority in favour of holding a new referendum. The party says if this request is rebuffed, it would pass a bill to hold a new referendum and it would be up to the UK government to challenge it in the courts. The UK government maintains that votes on constitutional matters require the prior agreement of Westminster. Question from Maxone in London In Greater London, the elected mayor is responsible for policing and has the same responsibilities as police and crime commissioners do in other areas. The role of a
PCC in London is carried out by the mayorâs appointed deputy for policing and

Wendy Farmer, who has run a stall in the town's market for 30 years, says trade has fallen as all the big shops have closed. The council has not helped during the pandemic, she says. But she supports the prime minister. ""Those that criticise, I'd like to see them them do what he's had to put up with in the last 12 months,"" she says. A full list of all the candidate standing in the area can be found here,external. Question from James Georgeson in South Lanarkshire The pandemic has had a serious impact oncampaigning in Scotland,external, but things have become a bit easier for the parties as some restrictions have been lifted. Leafleting was allowed from 15 March, with campaigners allowed to do face-to-face doorstep canvassing in most areas of Scotland from 12 April, and most campaigners had to remain in their local areas until 1 May. Campaigning was also paused followingthe death of Prince Philip. Question from Gabriel Beck in Eastbourne Because the pandemic will delay vote-counting (see our post earlier), the BBC's results programme will begin later than usual at 09.00 BST on Friday on the BBC News Channel, BBC Two and the BBC iPlayer. It will also be shown on BBC One in the afternoon. Huw Edwards and Kirsty Wark will lead the show, which will be co-hosted from London and Edinburgh. Special coverage will continue on Saturday from 13.15 BST to 22.00 BST. The BBC News website will have all the results as they are announced, with live results, and live pages with the latest reaction and analysis from our correspondents. With just two days to go until polling day, some of the party leaders have been on the campaign trail. We have not seen Boris Johnson on any election visits today because he has been doing avirtual meeting with the Indian PM. Here's what we have learned so far:  Question from Ruth Yarwood in Anglesey Counting will be unusual this year because of the Covid pandemic, and will last several days. Some counts, like the Hartlepool by-election, will take place overnight on Thursday. We will know all the results for the Welsh Senedd on Friday. Scotland starts counting in some areas on Friday but there won't be a final result until Saturday, or possibly even Sunday. English councils are spread over four days from Thursday night until Sunday. A dozen of the Police and Crime Commissioner elections in England won't count until Monday. Question from Finn in Tunbridge Wells If you are worried about your completed postal vote not arriving in time, you can hand it in at your local polling station before voting closes at 22.00 BST on Thursday. Alternatively, you can take it to your local electoral registration office before it closes on Thursday. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Sir Jeffrey Donaldson and Edwin Poots are in the running for the DUP leadership The vote to elect the next leader of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) will take place on 14 May, the party has said. Party officers met on Tuesday to discuss the procedure and timetable for the election of both a new leader and deputy leader. Agriculture Minister Edwin Poots and MP Sir Jeffrey Donaldson are bidding to succeed Arlene Foster. She steps down as DUP leaderon 28 May and first minister at the end of June. It is the first time in the party's 50-year history that a leadership contest has taken place. An announcement on the next leader is expected by 17:00 BST on 14 May, the party said. The meeting, to be overseen by party chairman Lord Morrow, will be conducted virtually. The party said contenders for both leader and deputy leader must submit their expression of interest by 17:00 BST on 6 May. The current deputy leader of the party is Lord Dodds. Mr Pootsbegan his leadership bid last Thursday, while Sir Jeffreyannounced his bid on Monday, the 100th anniversary of the formation of Northern Ireland. In a statement on Tuesday evening, Lord Morrow said the date of 14 May was chosen to reflect the fact that Covid restrictions are due to be reviewed at a meeting of the NI Executive on 13 May, and that the Queen's speech will take place in Parliament on 12 May. He said DUP representatives will be required to attend both commitments. ""In accordance with the constitution and rules of the Democratic Unionist Party, only party members, who are also members of the Northern Ireland Assembly and the House of Commons, are entitled to vote for the leader or deputy leader."" There are 28 DUP MLAs (Members of the Legislative Assembly) and eight MPs. South Down DUP MLA Jim Wells, who lost the whip in 2018 after he criticised the party leadership in the media, told BBC News NI he had received the letter that went to all DUP MLAs and MPs on Tuesday evening, informing them about the process for the vote. He said he was ""delighted"" his vote would count and reiterated he would be supporting Mr Poots. Arlene Foster will step down as DUP leader on 28 May Several senior DUP Stormont assembly members and the MP Paul Girvan have declared their support for Mr Poots. Speaking in the Northern Ireland Assembly on Tuesday, the Lagan Valley MLA confirmed he had ""no desire"" to hold the position of first minister should he be elected DUP leader. It is understood he would want to remain agriculture minister. Sir Jeffrey, the MP for Lagan Valley, has the backing of MPs Gavin Robinson and Jim Shannon as well as Education Minister Peter Weir and Junior Minister Gordon Lyons. Campaigners for both contenders claim their candidate has significant support within the party ranks. Sitting in the Stormont chamber on Tuesday, Arlene Foster cut a lonely figure on the benches where she once ruled. She was socially and politically distant from previously loyal supporters who signed a letter of no confidence in her leadership last week, forcing her to quit. Apart for the odd polite smile to those opposite wishing her well for the future, she showed no emotion. First Minister Arlene Foster (in yellow jacket) in the assembly chamber on Tuesday As she exited the chamber, one of the men who wants to replace her as leader entered through another door. Unlike Mrs Foster, Edwin Poots shared the benches with those who have already expressed support for his leadership bid. The contrast was stark. In order to become party leader, a candidate must secure the support of at least 18 of the party's assembly members and MPs. Mrs Fosterannounced her decision to resignafter facing a revolt from DUP members last week. She had led the party since December 2015 and was appointed first minister of Northern Ireland the following month. DUP facing divisive leadership battle BBC News NI understands that she will sever her ties with the DUP when she stands down as first minister, with sources close to her saying she thinks it is no longer the party she joined. Mrs Foster did not take part in a Tuesday morning meeting with her assembly team. The first minister was in the assembly chamber later as Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill responded to questions to the Executive Office.

Updates were brought to you by Doug Faulkner, Alexandra FouchÃ©, Francesca Gillett, Paul Kirby, Alex Therrien, Sophie Williams, James Clarke, Sarah Collerton and Claire Heald. And here's what's been happening around the world: Soon we will be bringing our coronavirus live page to a close for the day. But before we do, here is a round-up of the main UK stories from today: An 85-year-old woman who has not been outdoors for 14 months because of the pandemic has had her first trip out to get an ice cream. Julie Chuter had promised her mum Audrey they would get the biggest ice cream they could find when she took her to Tynemouth earlier. Audrey, who had been desperate to leave her care home, says: ""It's great to be out of the home and be outside, even if the weather is
rubbish! ""I love ice cream, it's my absolute favourite. I had to get one even
though it's cold and wet."" This video can not be played One of the most noticeable changes during the pandemic has been the wearing of face masks. But waste management systems are ""not equipped"" to handle the amount of plastic being thrown away - including from face masks, researchers say. Swansea University scientists say disposable face masks could be releasing chemical pollutants and plastics into the environment. They are calling for better regulation and more research into their disposal. Covid-19 restrictions in County Donegal, and across the Republic of Ireland, are due to ease from 10 May People in
Donegal have been urged not to partake in many of the Republic of Irelandâs post-lockdown
freedoms because of the countyâs high Covid-19 rate. The countryâs Level Five restrictions are being eased from 10 May. But
Chief Medical Officer Dr Tony Holohan says people in Donegal ""will
continue to need to see themselves as having to protect themselves"". It
currently has the highest Covid-19 rate in the country. Last
week the chief medical officer spoke about his concerns about the levels of
non-compliance with Covid-19 restrictions in the county. On
Saturday, the chief medical officer and Irish health minster met with local politicians to discuss the infection rate. Read more here Future lockdowns in the UK are unlikely, a scientist whose modelling led to the first lockdown tells the BBC. Prof Neil Ferguson says the possibility of a further lockdown can't be completely ruled out because of the ""worst case scenario"" of a new variant emerging that evades the current vaccines. In this scenario, it is possible restrictions could be needed again to boost people's immunity to the virus, for example with tweaked vaccines. He says: ""Do I think it's likely to happen? No I don't. I think we are much more likely to be on a steady course now out of this pandemic, at least in this country."" Ferguson says the data on falling covid cases, hospitalisations and deaths is very encouraging. ""With the one caveat that we need to keep to watching those variants carefully and get more data on them, I am actually feeling very optimistic and that optimism has gradually increased as the last three months have unfolded, from a terrible situation we were in in January to a remarkably good situation now."" And he says life will begin to return to normal by early summer. Singapore has announced a series of new restrictions, after cases rose last week and several new clusters - including locally transmitted cases of new variants - emerged on the island. Measures - which kick in from 8 May -  include tighter curbs on social gatherings of five people, stricter border controls, as well as a ban on spectators at sporting events. Travellers arriving from most countries will be required to quarantine for three weeks instead of two. Indoor gyms and fitness studios will be closed, and more people will be required to work from home. These are the tightest local measures since the city-state started easing curbs in the middle of last year
after a partial lockdown. Only last week, it had been deemed the best place in the world to live in Covid times.  Social distancing rules on buses should be relaxed to cater for increased demand, a Scottish operator says. Current Scottish government guidance is for one metre physical distancing between people on all forms of public transport. But independent operator McGill's says the restrictions mean it isnow turning away people at peak times because its buses are full. Transport Scotland says the Scottish government has ""invested significantly"" to ensure public transport services are available during the pandemic and says capacity on public transport will still need to be managed as wider restrictions are eased. McGill's managing director Ralph Roberts says he is worried a ""healthy return"" of passengers will be stymied by the distancing rules not being eased quickly enough. Bus industry sources tell BBC Scotland that a number of operators are nearing capacity at peak times under existing social distancing rules and they fear people will be put off getting back to using buses if the situation worsens. With all the talk today of green lists and European holidays, you may want a reminder of what the rules are. Currently, it is illegal to go abroad for non-essential trips, with the restrictions in place until at least 17 May. Under the proposed ""traffic light"" system, countries will be rated green, amber or red. Countries on thegreen listwill have the fewest travel rules, but you will still need to take a private Covid test in your holiday destination before returning to England and takea private PCR test,externalon or before day two of your arrival in England. But you will not have to isolate unless the test on arrival is positive. Foramber countriesyou will need to take a Covid test before returning to the UK, self-isolate at home for 10 days and pay forPCR Covid testson days two and eight of isolation. Rules will be similar to those already in place forred listcountries and will require you to stay in a hotel for 10 days. You can read more about the ruleshere. As we reported earlier, the Indian Premier League - the richest franchise cricket competition in the world - has beensuspended after several players and staff tested positivefor Covid-19. The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) has no plans to arrange a charter flight for the England contingent in India, as it is the responsibility of the franchises to get the players and staff home. When the players do leave India, they will have to be tested before departure and upon arrival in the UK, and then quarantine in a hotel for 10 days. None of those connected to England are thought to have tested positive for Covid-19, but it is unknown whether any have been in close contact with those who have. An ECB spokesperson says: ""We are in close contact with our players and staff in India as arrangements are put in place for them to return home safely."" England's limited overs captain Eoin Morgan is among the England players who are in India, where he plays for the Kolkata Knight Riders. India's main opposition Congress party has urged the government to declare a nationwide lockdown,as the number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the country passed 20 million.

Demand for Pfizer's Covid vaccine could bolster its revenues for years, the US drugs giant has said. Pfizer said it was expecting ""durable demand"" for the vaccine, in a similar way as for flu vaccines. In the first three months of 2021, the vaccine generated revenues of $3.5bn (Â£2.5bn) as governments scrambled to try to contain the pandemic. Revenue from it is expected to account for more than one third of Pfizer's full-year sales this year. The forecast is based on already-signed contracts for 1.6 billion vaccine doses to be delivered this year. Read more here. The chief medical adviser to US President Joe Biden, Dr Anthony Fauci, has told the BBC that other countries must step up to help India through the current health crisis and to ramp up vaccination rates. ""The number of people needing hospitalisation and not being able to get a hospital bed, the lack of oxygen, the lack of equipment, it is really a very desperate situation. We really need to get a concerted effort of other countries to try and help India out. ""Not only to help them from outside to within, but to help them to be able to get their own situation (under control), namely to produce more vaccines, and to get people vaccinated. ""Only 2% of the population is fully vaccinated and about 9-10% have partial vaccination. For a country of so many  people, we've got to do better than that and we've got to do better than  that quickly, because that's going to be the solution. That's the intermediate and long-range solution."" North Korea
has warned its citizens that vaccines are not a cure-all solution to the Covid
pandemic. It comes
amid indications the reclusive state has failed to secure adequate vaccine
supplies. An editorial in a state newspaper references problems with vaccine programmes
in some countries and says North Korea must uphold its virus restrictions. The country
has not recorded a single case of the virus although last month it processed
24,000 tests. Experts
doubt this claim as the country shares a border with China â a highly used
trade route. Covax â the international vaccine
distribution scheme â has allocated 1.7 million vaccine shots to North Korea. The daily figures also show the number of people to receive both vaccine doses has risen to 15,630,007, while the number to have one jab is 34,667,904. A further 160 patients were admitted into hospital. A further four people have died in the UK within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test, according to thelatest government figures,external. There were 1,946 cases recorded. Yesterday, one death and 1,649 cases were reported.

The event is part of a government pilot where ticket-holders provided a negative Covid test to be allowed in. Overill said the couple had been fans of Blossoms since they met, and their music is a ""big part of the family"". The vaccine made by drug company Pfizer-BioNTech is set to be authorised for
children and teenagers between the ages of 12 to 15 from this week or early next week, according to US media reports citing government officials. Pfizer has applied for emergency use authorisation for its vaccine, the reports say. A spokeswoman for the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) declined to give details on the approval timeline,telling The Washington Post,external: ""We can assure the public that we are working to review this request as quickly and transparently as possible."" The vaccine is currently authorised for people aged 16 and higher in the US.The company announced results of its vaccine trial in teenagers earlier this year,external.

"Abbie and AJ were trying to film a trick for social media when the accident happened Dancer Abbie Quinnen, who was badly burned when a social media stunt went wrong, says she has received ""horrible"" messages from trolls on Instagram since the accident in January. Quinnen and her partner, ex-Strictly star AJ Pritchard, were due to film a trick with highly-flammable liquid when a fireball ""shot across the room"". The 23-year-old suffered second and third degree burns across her body. One of the Instagram messages said: ""You should have burned to death."" Recounting the initial incident to Victoria Derbyshire on BBC Radio 2's Jeremy Vine Show, Quinnen said she immediately screamed for help as the liquid caught fire uncontrollably. ""I was in shock and thinking, how can I survive this?"" she said. ""I rolled on the floor and that didn't work, so I grabbed a heavy blanket and started trying to put out the flames that way. ""AJ was getting damp towels in the meantime."" Although it was over in seconds, she said ""it felt like a lifetime"" and she kept asking Pritchard, ""Is my face going to be okay? Am I going to be okay? Will you still love me?"" The dancer suffered second and third degree burns to her face, head, neck, ear, chest and down her right side; she also lost some of her hair. She has had three skin graft operations, two of which involved using someone else's skin - called an allograft. ""I could have been blinded. I could have lost my hearing. I'm so lucky. It could have been even worse,"" she said. At one point the dancer was having to take 27 tablets a day to cope with the pain. Quinnen said she has been helped by many people on Instagram who have shared their own experiences of being burned. But others have posted messages including: ""You should have burned to death""; ""You're now going to look like a waxwork model""; and ""Don't go near your niece and nephew, you'll scare them"". ""It's so horrible, I just think it's really sad and I feel a bit sorry for them,"" Quinnen said. One of the hardest things for her was thinking she would never look the same again. ""When I was in hospital, staff tried every day to persuade me to talk to a therapist, but I just didn't want to, I wasn't ready. Even looking at the reflection of my face in my 'phone screen was hideous,"" she said. When eventually spoke with a counsellor, they asked her to look into a mirror to help her accept what had happened to her. ""I was hysterical,"" she said. She credits Pritchard with helping her recover, but initially would get upset when he was going out to work on the Channel 4 soap opera, Hollyoaks. ""He was able to get on with his life whereas I was in bed struggling with the consequences. I wasn't thinking straight, I know he was trying to be strong for me. ""Then I caught AJ crying once and he was trying to say 'I'm sorry, I'm sorry'. I was shocked because he'd obviously been keeping it in for weeks."" Quinnen said she has cried every day since her accident in mid-January up until last week, but is now trying focus on her goal of being back on stage, performing alongside Pritchard and his brother Curtis in their autumn tour. She also wants to start a petition to get videos like the one she and her partner were trying to recreate removed from YouTube so no one else gets injured like her. She says she has asked ""Why did this happen to me?"" and is very anxious. ""I don't go out too much and I'm constantly thinking something else bad is going to happen."" Qunnen also paid tribute to the NHS medics who cared for her. ""They are the closest thing to superheroes. My surgeon was amazing - I trusted her with my life. And all the nurses are so amazing."" Doctors have told her they won't know for another two years how much scarring she will have on her face in the long-term. As to her future with Pritchard, she says they've talked about marriage and children. ""AJ has been incredible. By my side the whole time, feeding me and cleaning my wounds,"" she added. ""I would love to get married to AJ. He is my dream man. I can't imagine my life without him.""

postal voting papers, despite having requested them weeks ago. The local authority says itâs
also been contacted by several electoral candidates, who raised the issue. It is asking anyone
who has not yet received their papers to contact its election team as quickly
as possible. The council does not yet know how many papers are missing. There was also a delay in sending out postal votes in Sheffield, with 15,000 going out over the Bank Holiday weekend. People are being encouraged to return the ballots on the day they arrive. The Electoral Commission said it was aware some councils had reported printing issues and it was supporting them to have everything in place before polls open on Thursday. Completed postal votes must be returned by the close of voting at 10pm on Thursday. Those who have not managed to send their ballots back can hand them in at their local polling station. Philip SimBBC Scotland political correspondent With two days to go until the Holyrood election, there seems to be little mystery about the final result - with only the SNP talking about forming a government. But there are still some key questions to be answered, which could have a huge bearing on Scotland's future. Will the SNP secure an outright majority? Could they build a pro-independence majority with the help of other, smaller parties? Will the Conservatives hold off a Labour challenge in the battle for second place? And what are the factors which could help answer these questions? Five key factors could determine the answers to these critical questions: Read Philip's full analysis of these questionshere. Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey has been campaigning in Edinburgh today. He said Covid had reminded everyone just how important local community is and his party was offering ""local champions"" in these elections. He added that people appreciate their local green spaces more than ever and the Lib Dems had put the environment at the heart of their campaign. Sir Ed said: ""The Liberal Democrat environment record in local government is unbeatable, whether it's delivering the country's first clean air zone outside of London to topping the country's leader board for recycling rates.""

Almost 700 libraries have closed across Britain since 2010 as councils look at ways to save money, but in Middlesbrough they are spending more. It is thought almost one in 10 children in the town do not own a book and it has a problem with literacy. Mother-of-three Nisha Mayuran, who is originally from Sri Lanka, has made it her family home. Ahead of Thursday's local elections across England , she explains how important the library is to her and her children.  Journalist: Chris Robinson, filmed and edited: Chris Middis Labour's Sadiq Khan is on course for a second term as London mayor, the latest opinion poll suggests, although his likely margin of victory could be narrower than previously predicted. For much of the campaign, pollsters have been suggesting Mr Khan could win on the first round of ballots, with more than 50% of first preference votes, under theSupplementary Vote,externalsystem used in the contest. A new poll by Opinium suggests Mr Khan will not get more than 50% of first preference votes, but he will get 63% of the vote after second preferences have been counted. According to Opinium, crime has now overtaken the NHS as the most important issue for Londoners. This is the only topic they've polled on where the Conservative candidate, Shaun Bailey, has a slight lead over Mr Khan. The Liberal Democrats and Greens are in a close contest for third and fourth places, according to the poll. The survey was of 1,005 London adults over 18, between 28 April to 3 May. Question from Paul Hodson, Buckingham Parish councils control millions of pounds in public funds, and influence our day-to-day lives. On 6 May, people across England will vote in local authority elections. But some live in areas where seats on parish and town councils - the most local of local authorities - will also be up for grabs. You can read more here in our guide: What do parish councils actually do? BBC reporter Jacob Tomlinson caught up with England's most well-known parish councillor Jackie Weaver, who told him: ""The place where you live, that's where we can make a difference"". This video can not be played The viral parish councillor tells us how parish councils work and why they're important Question from Mel Akers in Worcestershire The
government is due to set out its law-making priorities for the next year on
Tuesday next week, when the Queen will officially open the next annual
""session"" at the State Opening of Parliament. There have been reports that the speech will contain an ambition to reform the sector. But nothing has been officially announced as things stand. Boris Johnson said he had a ""clear plan"" for social carewhen he took office in July 2019and has been under pressure from opposition parties to announce a detailed blueprint. If you're just joining us, welcome to our coverage of the last few days of campaigning. Thursday sees a bumper set of elections, including for:  Each election has its own system and some people can vote in more than one poll. We've produceda very simple guideto all the different elections so you know what is happening in your area and across the country. It's been suggest the brownies (not these ones) were in a box that read 'Vote Labour'. Police are investigating claims the Labour candidate for
West Yorkshire Mayor has broken election laws. There are allegations Tracy Brabin broke the law by
offering people brownies. A Lib Dem Councillor, Tom Gordon, tweeted it was the ""second time in as many days"" he had seen Ms Brabin  ""out and about with boxes of brownies on them that say  ""Vote Labour"" on them"". Labour says the cakes were offered to party members after
they had been campaigning â which would not be against the rules. The Electoral Commission says there is only a breach of the law if there is âcorrupt intentâ and it does not apply to
hospitality. Question from James in London The 2014 independence referendum was underpinned by a so-called section 30 order, under which Westminster gave the Scottish Parliament the power to carry out the vote. The SNP says,externalit will seek this power again if this month's Scottish Parliament elections produce a majority in favour of holding a new referendum. The party says if this request is rebuffed, it would pass a bill to hold a new referendum and it would be up to the UK government to challenge it in the courts. The UK government maintains that votes on constitutional matters require the prior agreement of Westminster. Question from Maxone in London In Greater London, the elected mayor is responsible for policing and has the same responsibilities as police and crime commissioners do in other areas. The role of a
PCC in London is carried out by the mayorâs appointed deputy for policing and
crime. The mayor also appoints the Metropolitan Police commissioner, who is in charge of the day-to-day running of the force and holds them to account. This video can not be played Elections 2021: The mayor and the Met The World at OneBBC Radio 4 Dudley is at the heart of the so-called' red wall' - the belt of Midlands and Northern seats that returned Labour politicians for decades. But like many of its neighbours, it is starting to turn blue: it already has two Tory MPs, and the council is run by a minority Conservative administration. For Radio Four's World at One,BBC political reporter Rob Mayor,externalhas been finding out what people think of the upcoming elections: Council leader Patrick Harley is hoping to win a Conservative majority on Thursday. He says it will allow the town to attract investment from central government, as it has been doing for the last few years. But leader of the Labour group, Cllr Qadar Zada, says unemployment is ""up by 75%"" during the pandemic, with 20,000 young people out of work. Residents are also worried about crime, he says. Wendy Farmer, who has run a stall in the town's market for 30 years, says trade has fallen as all the big shops have closed. The council has not helped during the pandemic, she says. But she supports the prime minister. ""Those that criticise, I'd like to see them them do what he's had to put up with in the last 12 months,"" she says. A full list of all the candidate standing in the area can be found here,external. Question from James Georgeson in South Lanarkshire The pandemic has had a serious impact oncampaigning in Scotland,external, but things have become a bit easier for the parties as some restrictions have been lifted. Leafleting was allowed from 15 March, with campaigners allowed to do face-to-face doorstep canvassing in most areas of Scotland from 12 April, and most campaigners had to remain in their local areas until 1 May. Campaigning was also paused followingthe death of Prince Philip. Question from Gabriel Beck in Eastbourne Because the pandemic will delay vote-counting (see our post earlier), the BBC's results programme will begin later than usual at 09.00 BST on Friday on the BBC News Channel, BBC Two and the BBC iPlayer. It will also be shown on BBC One in the afternoon. Huw Edwards and Kirsty Wark will lead the show, which will be co-hosted from London and Edinburgh. Special coverage will continue on Saturday from 13.15 BST to 22.00 BST. The BBC News website will have all the results as they are announced, with live results, and live pages with the latest reaction and analysis from our correspondents. With just two days to go until polling day, some of the party leaders have been on the campaign trail. We have not seen Boris Johnson on any election visits today because he has been doing avirtual meeting with the Indian PM. Here's what we have learned so far:  Question from Ruth Yarwood in Anglesey Counting will be unusual this year because of the Covid pandemic, and will last several days. Some counts, like the Hartlepool by-election, will take place overnight on Thursday. We will know all the results for the Welsh Senedd on Friday. Scotland starts counting in some areas on Friday but there won't be a final result until Saturday, or possibly even Sunday. English councils are spread over four days from Thursday night until Sunday. A dozen of the Police and Crime Commissioner elections in England won't count until Monday. Question from Finn in Tunbridge Wells If you are worried about your completed postal vote not arriving in time, you can hand it in at your local polling station before voting closes at 22.00 BST on Thursday. Alternatively, you can take it to your local electoral registration office before it closes on Thursday. Â© 2025 BBC.

And here's what's been happening around the world: Soon we will be bringing our coronavirus live page to a close for the day. But before we do, here is a round-up of the main UK stories from today: An 85-year-old woman who has not been outdoors for 14 months because of the pandemic has had her first trip out to get an ice cream. Julie Chuter had promised her mum Audrey they would get the biggest ice cream they could find when she took her to Tynemouth earlier. Audrey, who had been desperate to leave her care home, says: ""It's great to be out of the home and be outside, even if the weather is
rubbish! ""I love ice cream, it's my absolute favourite. I had to get one even
though it's cold and wet."" This video can not be played One of the most noticeable changes during the pandemic has been the wearing of face masks. But waste management systems are ""not equipped"" to handle the amount of plastic being thrown away - including from face masks, researchers say. Swansea University scientists say disposable face masks could be releasing chemical pollutants and plastics into the environment. They are calling for better regulation and more research into their disposal. Covid-19 restrictions in County Donegal, and across the Republic of Ireland, are due to ease from 10 May People in
Donegal have been urged not to partake in many of the Republic of Irelandâs post-lockdown
freedoms because of the countyâs high Covid-19 rate. The countryâs Level Five restrictions are being eased from 10 May. But
Chief Medical Officer Dr Tony Holohan says people in Donegal ""will
continue to need to see themselves as having to protect themselves"". It
currently has the highest Covid-19 rate in the country. Last
week the chief medical officer spoke about his concerns about the levels of
non-compliance with Covid-19 restrictions in the county. On
Saturday, the chief medical officer and Irish health minster met with local politicians to discuss the infection rate. Read more here Future lockdowns in the UK are unlikely, a scientist whose modelling led to the first lockdown tells the BBC. Prof Neil Ferguson says the possibility of a further lockdown can't be completely ruled out because of the ""worst case scenario"" of a new variant emerging that evades the current vaccines. In this scenario, it is possible restrictions could be needed again to boost people's immunity to the virus, for example with tweaked vaccines. He says: ""Do I think it's likely to happen? No I don't. I think we are much more likely to be on a steady course now out of this pandemic, at least in this country."" Ferguson says the data on falling covid cases, hospitalisations and deaths is very encouraging. ""With the one caveat that we need to keep to watching those variants carefully and get more data on them, I am actually feeling very optimistic and that optimism has gradually increased as the last three months have unfolded, from a terrible situation we were in in January to a remarkably good situation now."" And he says life will begin to return to normal by early summer. Singapore has announced a series of new restrictions, after cases rose last week and several new clusters - including locally transmitted cases of new variants - emerged on the island. Measures - which kick in from 8 May -  include tighter curbs on social gatherings of five people, stricter border controls, as well as a ban on spectators at sporting events. Travellers arriving from most countries will be required to quarantine for three weeks instead of two. Indoor gyms and fitness studios will be closed, and more people will be required to work from home. These are the tightest local measures since the city-state started easing curbs in the middle of last year
after a partial lockdown. Only last week, it had been deemed the best place in the world to live in Covid times.  Social distancing rules on buses should be relaxed to cater for increased demand, a Scottish operator says. Current Scottish government guidance is for one metre physical distancing between people on all forms of public transport. But independent operator McGill's says the restrictions mean it isnow turning away people at peak times because its buses are full. Transport Scotland says the Scottish government has ""invested significantly"" to ensure public transport services are available during the pandemic and says capacity on public transport will still need to be managed as wider restrictions are eased. McGill's managing director Ralph Roberts says he is worried a ""healthy return"" of passengers will be stymied by the distancing rules not being eased quickly enough. Bus industry sources tell BBC Scotland that a number of operators are nearing capacity at peak times under existing social distancing rules and they fear people will be put off getting back to using buses if the situation worsens. With all the talk today of green lists and European holidays, you may want a reminder of what the rules are. Currently, it is illegal to go abroad for non-essential trips, with the restrictions in place until at least 17 May. Under the proposed ""traffic light"" system, countries will be rated green, amber or red. Countries on thegreen listwill have the fewest travel rules, but you will still need to take a private Covid test in your holiday destination before returning to England and takea private PCR test,externalon or before day two of your arrival in England. But you will not have to isolate unless the test on arrival is positive. Foramber countriesyou will need to take a Covid test before returning to the UK, self-isolate at home for 10 days and pay forPCR Covid testson days two and eight of isolation. Rules will be similar to those already in place forred listcountries and will require you to stay in a hotel for 10 days. You can read more about the ruleshere. As we reported earlier, the Indian Premier League - the richest franchise cricket competition in the world - has beensuspended after several players and staff tested positivefor Covid-19. The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) has no plans to arrange a charter flight for the England contingent in India, as it is the responsibility of the franchises to get the players and staff home. When the players do leave India, they will have to be tested before departure and upon arrival in the UK, and then quarantine in a hotel for 10 days. None of those connected to England are thought to have tested positive for Covid-19, but it is unknown whether any have been in close contact with those who have. An ECB spokesperson says: ""We are in close contact with our players and staff in India as arrangements are put in place for them to return home safely."" England's limited overs captain Eoin Morgan is among the England players who are in India, where he plays for the Kolkata Knight Riders. India's main opposition Congress party has urged the government to declare a nationwide lockdown,as the number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the country passed 20 million.

Demand for Pfizer's Covid vaccine could bolster its revenues for years, the US drugs giant has said. Pfizer said it was expecting ""durable demand"" for the vaccine, in a similar way as for flu vaccines. In the first three months of 2021, the vaccine generated revenues of $3.5bn (Â£2.5bn) as governments scrambled to try to contain the pandemic. Revenue from it is expected to account for more than one third of Pfizer's full-year sales this year. The forecast is based on already-signed contracts for 1.6 billion vaccine doses to be delivered this year. Read more here. The chief medical adviser to US President Joe Biden, Dr Anthony Fauci, has told the BBC that other countries must step up to help India through the current health crisis and to ramp up vaccination rates. ""The number of people needing hospitalisation and not being able to get a hospital bed, the lack of oxygen, the lack of equipment, it is really a very desperate situation. We really need to get a concerted effort of other countries to try and help India out. ""Not only to help them from outside to within, but to help them to be able to get their own situation (under control), namely to produce more vaccines, and to get people vaccinated. ""Only 2% of the population is fully vaccinated and about 9-10% have partial vaccination. For a country of so many  people, we've got to do better than that and we've got to do better than  that quickly, because that's going to be the solution. That's the intermediate and long-range solution."" North Korea
has warned its citizens that vaccines are not a cure-all solution to the Covid
pandemic. It comes
amid indications the reclusive state has failed to secure adequate vaccine
supplies. An editorial in a state newspaper references problems with vaccine programmes
in some countries and says North Korea must uphold its virus restrictions. The country
has not recorded a single case of the virus although last month it processed

Currently, it is illegal to go abroad for non-essential trips, with the restrictions in place until at least 17 May. Under the proposed ""traffic light"" system, countries will be rated green, amber or red. Countries on thegreen listwill have the fewest travel rules, but you will still need to take a private Covid test in your holiday destination before returning to England and takea private PCR test,externalon or before day two of your arrival in England. But you will not have to isolate unless the test on arrival is positive. Foramber countriesyou will need to take a Covid test before returning to the UK, self-isolate at home for 10 days and pay forPCR Covid testson days two and eight of isolation. Rules will be similar to those already in place forred listcountries and will require you to stay in a hotel for 10 days. You can read more about the ruleshere. As we reported earlier, the Indian Premier League - the richest franchise cricket competition in the world - has beensuspended after several players and staff tested positivefor Covid-19. The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) has no plans to arrange a charter flight for the England contingent in India, as it is the responsibility of the franchises to get the players and staff home. When the players do leave India, they will have to be tested before departure and upon arrival in the UK, and then quarantine in a hotel for 10 days. None of those connected to England are thought to have tested positive for Covid-19, but it is unknown whether any have been in close contact with those who have. An ECB spokesperson says: ""We are in close contact with our players and staff in India as arrangements are put in place for them to return home safely."" England's limited overs captain Eoin Morgan is among the England players who are in India, where he plays for the Kolkata Knight Riders. India's main opposition Congress party has urged the government to declare a nationwide lockdown,as the number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the country passed 20 million.

Demand for Pfizer's Covid vaccine could bolster its revenues for years, the US drugs giant has said. Pfizer said it was expecting ""durable demand"" for the vaccine, in a similar way as for flu vaccines. In the first three months of 2021, the vaccine generated revenues of $3.5bn (Â£2.5bn) as governments scrambled to try to contain the pandemic. Revenue from it is expected to account for more than one third of Pfizer's full-year sales this year. The forecast is based on already-signed contracts for 1.6 billion vaccine doses to be delivered this year. Read more here. The chief medical adviser to US President Joe Biden, Dr Anthony Fauci, has told the BBC that other countries must step up to help India through the current health crisis and to ramp up vaccination rates. ""The number of people needing hospitalisation and not being able to get a hospital bed, the lack of oxygen, the lack of equipment, it is really a very desperate situation. We really need to get a concerted effort of other countries to try and help India out. ""Not only to help them from outside to within, but to help them to be able to get their own situation (under control), namely to produce more vaccines, and to get people vaccinated. ""Only 2% of the population is fully vaccinated and about 9-10% have partial vaccination. For a country of so many  people, we've got to do better than that and we've got to do better than  that quickly, because that's going to be the solution. That's the intermediate and long-range solution."" North Korea
has warned its citizens that vaccines are not a cure-all solution to the Covid
pandemic. It comes
amid indications the reclusive state has failed to secure adequate vaccine
supplies. An editorial in a state newspaper references problems with vaccine programmes
in some countries and says North Korea must uphold its virus restrictions. The country
has not recorded a single case of the virus although last month it processed
24,000 tests. Experts
doubt this claim as the country shares a border with China â a highly used
trade route. Covax â the international vaccine
distribution scheme â has allocated 1.7 million vaccine shots to North Korea. The daily figures also show the number of people to receive both vaccine doses has risen to 15,630,007, while the number to have one jab is 34,667,904. A further 160 patients were admitted into hospital. A further four people have died in the UK within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test, according to thelatest government figures,external. There were 1,946 cases recorded. Yesterday, one death and 1,649 cases were reported.

The event is part of a government pilot where ticket-holders provided a negative Covid test to be allowed in.

children and teenagers between the ages of 12 to 15 from this week or early next week, according to US media reports citing government officials.

"There remains ""little association"" between technology use and mental-health problems, a study of more than 430,000 10 to 15-year-olds suggests. The Oxford Internet Institute compared TV viewing, social-media and device use with feelings of depression, suicidal tendencies and behavioural problems. It found a small drop in association between depression and social-media use and TV viewing, from 1991 to 2019, There was a small rise in that between emotional issues and social-media use. ""We couldn't tell the difference between social-media impact and mental health in 2010 and 2019,"" study co-author Prof Andrew Przybylski. said. ""We're not saying that fewer happy people use more social media. ""We're saying that the connection is not getting stronger."" And this was a warning to regulators and lawmakers focusing on commonly held beliefs about the harmful effects of technology on young people's mental health. Participants, in the US and UK, graded their own feelings using set questions with sliding scale responses. And they were asked about the duration of social-media or device activity but not more specifically how they had spent that time. The paper is published in the journalClinical Psychological Science,external. In January 2021, a study suggested heavy social-media usewas linked to negative well-being and self-esteem among teenagers. Other factors affecting young people's mental health include thecoronavirus pandemic.

"Sir Jeffrey Donaldson and Edwin Poots are in the running for the DUP leadership The vote to elect the next leader of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) will take place on 14 May, the party has said. Party officers met on Tuesday to discuss the procedure and timetable for the election of both a new leader and deputy leader. Agriculture Minister Edwin Poots and MP Sir Jeffrey Donaldson are bidding to succeed Arlene Foster. She steps down as DUP leaderon 28 May and first minister at the end of June. It is the first time in the party's 50-year history that a leadership contest has taken place. An announcement on the next leader is expected by 17:00 BST on 14 May, the party said. The meeting, to be overseen by party chairman Lord Morrow, will be conducted virtually. The party said contenders for both leader and deputy leader must submit their expression of interest by 17:00 BST on 6 May. The current deputy leader of the party is Lord Dodds. Mr Pootsbegan his leadership bid last Thursday, while Sir Jeffreyannounced his bid on Monday, the 100th anniversary of the formation of Northern Ireland. In a statement on Tuesday evening, Lord Morrow said the date of 14 May was chosen to reflect the fact that Covid restrictions are due to be reviewed at a meeting of the NI Executive on 13 May, and that the Queen's speech will take place in Parliament on 12 May. He said DUP representatives will be required to attend both commitments. ""In accordance with the constitution and rules of the Democratic Unionist Party, only party members, who are also members of the Northern Ireland Assembly and the House of Commons, are entitled to vote for the leader or deputy leader."" There are 28 DUP MLAs (Members of the Legislative Assembly) and eight MPs. South Down DUP MLA Jim Wells, who lost the whip in 2018 after he criticised the party leadership in the media, told BBC News NI he had received the letter that went to all DUP MLAs and MPs on Tuesday evening, informing them about the process for the vote. He said he was ""delighted"" his vote would count and reiterated he would be supporting Mr Poots. Arlene Foster will step down as DUP leader on 28 May Several senior DUP Stormont assembly members and the MP Paul Girvan have declared their support for Mr Poots. Speaking in the Northern Ireland Assembly on Tuesday, the Lagan Valley MLA confirmed he had ""no desire"" to hold the position of first minister should he be elected DUP leader. It is understood he would want to remain agriculture minister. Sir Jeffrey, the MP for Lagan Valley, has the backing of MPs Gavin Robinson and Jim Shannon as well as Education Minister Peter Weir and Junior Minister Gordon Lyons. Campaigners for both contenders claim their candidate has significant support within the party ranks. Sitting in the Stormont chamber on Tuesday, Arlene Foster cut a lonely figure on the benches where she once ruled. She was socially and politically distant from previously loyal supporters who signed a letter of no confidence in her leadership last week, forcing her to quit. Apart for the odd polite smile to those opposite wishing her well for the future, she showed no emotion. First Minister Arlene Foster (in yellow jacket) in the assembly chamber on Tuesday As she exited the chamber, one of the men who wants to replace her as leader entered through another door. Unlike Mrs Foster, Edwin Poots shared the benches with those who have already expressed support for his leadership bid. The contrast was stark. In order to become party leader, a candidate must secure the support of at least 18 of the party's assembly members and MPs. Mrs Fosterannounced her decision to resignafter facing a revolt from DUP members last week. She had led the party since December 2015 and was appointed first minister of Northern Ireland the following month. DUP facing divisive leadership battle BBC News NI understands that she will sever her ties with the DUP when she stands down as first minister, with sources close to her saying she thinks it is no longer the party she joined. Mrs Foster did not take part in a Tuesday morning meeting with her assembly team. The first minister was in the assembly chamber later as Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill responded to questions to the Executive Office.

Updates were brought to you by Doug Faulkner, Alexandra FouchÃ©, Francesca Gillett, Paul Kirby, Alex Therrien, Sophie Williams, James Clarke, Sarah Collerton and Claire Heald. And here's what's been happening around the world: Soon we will be bringing our coronavirus live page to a close for the day. But before we do, here is a round-up of the main UK stories from today: An 85-year-old woman who has not been outdoors for 14 months because of the pandemic has had her first trip out to get an ice cream. Julie Chuter had promised her mum Audrey they would get the biggest ice cream they could find when she took her to Tynemouth earlier. Audrey, who had been desperate to leave her care home, says: ""It's great to be out of the home and be outside, even if the weather is
rubbish! ""I love ice cream, it's my absolute favourite. I had to get one even
though it's cold and wet."" This video can not be played One of the most noticeable changes during the pandemic has been the wearing of face masks. But waste management systems are ""not equipped"" to handle the amount of plastic being thrown away - including from face masks, researchers say. Swansea University scientists say disposable face masks could be releasing chemical pollutants and plastics into the environment. They are calling for better regulation and more research into their disposal. Covid-19 restrictions in County Donegal, and across the Republic of Ireland, are due to ease from 10 May People in
Donegal have been urged not to partake in many of the Republic of Irelandâs post-lockdown
freedoms because of the countyâs high Covid-19 rate. The countryâs Level Five restrictions are being eased from 10 May. But
Chief Medical Officer Dr Tony Holohan says people in Donegal ""will
continue to need to see themselves as having to protect themselves"". It
currently has the highest Covid-19 rate in the country. Last
week the chief medical officer spoke about his concerns about the levels of
non-compliance with Covid-19 restrictions in the county. On
Saturday, the chief medical officer and Irish health minster met with local politicians to discuss the infection rate. Read more here Future lockdowns in the UK are unlikely, a scientist whose modelling led to the first lockdown tells the BBC. Prof Neil Ferguson says the possibility of a further lockdown can't be completely ruled out because of the ""worst case scenario"" of a new variant emerging that evades the current vaccines. In this scenario, it is possible restrictions could be needed again to boost people's immunity to the virus, for example with tweaked vaccines. He says: ""Do I think it's likely to happen? No I don't. I think we are much more likely to be on a steady course now out of this pandemic, at least in this country."" Ferguson says the data on falling covid cases, hospitalisations and deaths is very encouraging. ""With the one caveat that we need to keep to watching those variants carefully and get more data on them, I am actually feeling very optimistic and that optimism has gradually increased as the last three months have unfolded, from a terrible situation we were in in January to a remarkably good situation now."" And he says life will begin to return to normal by early summer. Singapore has announced a series of new restrictions, after cases rose last week and several new clusters - including locally transmitted cases of new variants - emerged on the island. Measures - which kick in from 8 May -  include tighter curbs on social gatherings of five people, stricter border controls, as well as a ban on spectators at sporting events. Travellers arriving from most countries will be required to quarantine for three weeks instead of two. Indoor gyms and fitness studios will be closed, and more people will be required to work from home. These are the tightest local measures since the city-state started easing curbs in the middle of last year
after a partial lockdown. Only last week, it had been deemed the best place in the world to live in Covid times.  Social distancing rules on buses should be relaxed to cater for increased demand, a Scottish operator says. Current Scottish government guidance is for one metre physical distancing between people on all forms of public transport. But independent operator McGill's says the restrictions mean it isnow turning away people at peak times because its buses are full. Transport Scotland says the Scottish government has ""invested significantly"" to ensure public transport services are available during the pandemic and says capacity on public transport will still need to be managed as wider restrictions are eased. McGill's managing director Ralph Roberts says he is worried a ""healthy return"" of passengers will be stymied by the distancing rules not being eased quickly enough. Bus industry sources tell BBC Scotland that a number of operators are nearing capacity at peak times under existing social distancing rules and they fear people will be put off getting back to using buses if the situation worsens. With all the talk today of green lists and European holidays, you may want a reminder of what the rules are.

"Boris Johnson and US Secretary of State Antony Blinken discussed the ""close alignment"" between foreign policy in London and Washington during their meeting earlier, No 10 has said. A No 10 spokeswoman said the PM and Mr Blinken agreed UK-US co-operation would be ""instrumental"" in tackling Covid-19. They also welcomed their nations' joint work on areas like trade and defence. It came as G7 powers met in London for their first face-to-face meetings in over two years. The group is discussing challenges including climate change and threats to human rights. The talks, held amid tight Covid restrictions, will finish on Wednesday. The G7 group - the world's seven largest so-called advanced economies - is made up of the UK, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States. Australia, India, South Korea and South Africa have also been invited as guests, as the UK tries to deepen ties with the Indo-Pacific region. The UK, which currently holds the rotating presidency of the G7, willhost a leaders' summitin Cornwall next month. At their meeting, Mr Johnson and Mr Blinken agreed that UK-US co-operation would be ""instrumental"" in making progress in the fight against coronavirus, alongside ""protecting the environment and other international priorities"", the spokeswoman said. They also agreed that the global rollout of coronavirus vaccines would be key in beating the pandemic, and emphasised the ""importance of G7 work in this area, including efforts to increase international manufacturing capability"". The spokeswoman added that foreign policy issues, including Afghanistan, Iran and China, were also discussed, and Mr Johnson ""looked forward to welcoming"" US President Joe Biden to the UK when he attends the leaders' summit in June - hisfirst overseas trip since his election victory. Rich states want to send 40m more girls to school What is the G7 and what does it do? UK and India agree to let more young people in Earlier, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the summit of foreign ministers ""demonstrates that diplomacy is back"", and showed the importance of ""getting countries together"". Mr Raab, wearing a face mask, welcomed counterparts earlier at Lancaster House in London, with forearm bumps replacing the usual handshakes. After talks on Myanmar on Tuesday morning, the G7 discussed issues including the crisis in Libya and the war in Syria. Politicians kept their distance for the traditional group photo Mr Raab was expected to urge stronger co-operation between the G7 and the guest nations at a working dinner on Tuesday evening. Speaking ahead of the dinner on Tuesday, he told reporters the summit provided a ""good opportunity"" to talk to India, a guest at the summit, about how G7 nations could help the country amid itsspike in Covid cases. This included a chance to seek ""positive answers"" about what developed nations would do with surplus domestic supplies of vaccines, he added. Lancaster House in central London has played host to many historic negotiations, but rarely will it have seen such diplomatic speed dating as it will later. For the next few days, foreign ministers will scurry round the clock from meeting to meeting, doing as much business face to face as they can after months of virtual diplomacy. They will discuss the world's big geopolitical issues: from China to Myanmar, Ethiopia to Ukraine, Syria to the Sahel. The underlying theme will be how they can best organise to defend international rules and open societies against the threat of autocratic regimes. And for the UK, the meeting's host, it's a big test to see if its global foreign policy can live up to its name. The summit comes amid criticism over the UK's decision to cut overseas aid spending from 0.7% of national income to 0.5% - a reduction of more than Â£4bn. Mr Raab said this had been a ""difficult decision"" but that the UK still had scope ""to be an even greater force for good in the world"". On Monday, it was announced that the G7 would use the summit to commit toinvesting $15bn (Â£10.8bn) to help women in developing countries. They are also expected to agree a new target of sending 40 million more girls from low and middle-income countries to school within five years.

"Pandora is launching its lab-made diamonds in the UK ahead of a global rollout The world's biggest jeweller, Pandora, says it will no longer sell mined diamonds and will switch to exclusively laboratory-made diamonds. Concerns about the environment and working practices in the mining industry have led to growing demand for alternatives to mined diamonds. Pandora's chief executive, Alexander Lacik, told the BBC the change was part of a broader sustainability drive. He said the firm was pursuing it because ""it's the right thing to do"". They are also cheaper: ""We can essentially create the same outcome as nature has created, but at a very, very different price."" Mr Lacik explains they can be made for as little as ""a third of what it is for something that we've dug up from the ground."" How do you know your diamond isn't fake? How to make a diamond in a day Purple-pink diamond sells for $26.6m (Â£20.1m) In 2020, worldwide lab-grown diamond production grew to between 6 and 7 million carats. Meanwhile the production of mined diamonds fell to 111 million carats last year, having peaked at 152 million in 2017, according to a report from the Antwerp World Diamond Centre (AWDC) and the consultancy Bain & Company. Production fell most in Russia, Canada, Botswana and Australia. Lab-grown diamonds such as these from the French company, Diam-Concept are growing in popularity The coronavirus pandemic has had a major impact on the diamond industry. De Beers, which produces about one-fifth of the world's mined diamonds, says production fell 18% last year. Economic uncertainty and lockdowns led to a slump in demand and falling prices, although there has been something of a recovery since. Pandora's lab-made diamonds are being made in Britain, and the UK is the first country where they will be sold. The new diamond jewellery will start at Â£250 ($350). Although diamonds have traditionally only been a very small share of the 100 million pieces Pandora sells worldwide each year, Mr Lacik believes that will be boosted by lower prices. ""Pandora jewellery today is much more of an everyday type of jewellery, even though a large proportion of it is gifted. The way the diamond industry has kind of been created to a large degree has been very much about gifting, and in particular around when people get engaged or married"". Pandora CEO Alexander Lacik thinks lab-grown diamonds can help the whole industry grow ""We're trying to open up this playing field and say, you know, with the type of value equation that we offer, you can use this everyday if you want."" He expects people to buy gifts more often for themselves instead. ""What might very well happen is actually that the total demand for diamonds is going to increase. So it may actually not be a question of, we steal somebody else's lunch"". Pandora hopes that the lower price of lab-made diamonds will lead to increased sales Olya Linde, the lead author of the Bain report, agrees that there is room for both. ""I believe that natural diamonds and lab grown diamonds can wonderfully coexist and grow the overall diamond market. There's clear demand for each type of product."" Better design and lower prices are, says Ms Linde, the top reasons why customers pick lab-made diamonds over their naturally occurring counterparts. Concerns about the environmental, sustainability and ethical impact of mined diamonds didn't make the top five. However, Bain's survey found that concerns about sustainability were more important to ""Millennials"" and ""Gen-Z"" than older age groups when buying diamond jewellery. One problem with lab-made diamonds, though, is that they can take a lot of energy to produce. Between 50% and 60% of them come from China, where they are made in a process known as ""high-pressure, high-temperature technology"". The use of coal powered electricity is widespread. This video can not be played Laboratory-made diamonds are today all but indistinguishable from the real thing However in the United States, the biggest retail market for lab-grown diamonds, there is a greater focus on using renewable energy. The largest US producer, Diamond Foundry, says its process is ""100% hydro-powered, meaning zero emissions"". Both types are chemically and physically identical to mined diamonds. But conflict-free production is still a big concern for customers across different age groups, according to Bain. It's now more than 20 years since the Kimberley Process came into force. The UN-backed process aims to stop diamonds being used to fuel conflicts after years of that happening in countries such as Angola, Ivory Coast, Sierra Leone and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Actor Leonardo DiCaprio invested in Diamond Foundry after starring in Hollywood thriller ""Blood Diamond"" Last year,a report by Human Rights Watch,externalfound that some major jewellery companies were doing better at sourcing mined diamonds, ""but most cannot assure consumers that their jewellery is untainted by human rights abuses"". It found that Pandora was one of the best performers, having taken significant steps towards responsible sourcing. But for the World Diamond Council (WDC), which represents the mined diamond industry, lab-made diamonds are not the answer. It says any suggestion they ""would have a role in preventing trade in conflict diamonds is spurious and not based on fact"". The WDC adds that for people living in artisanal and small-scale diamond mining communities stopping the mining of diamonds ""would remove a primary source of income"" and ""would have devastating impacts on their livelihoods, causing poverty and further unrest"". This video can not be played Mining diamonds in Botswana Pandora chief Mr Lacik says the long term is what matters when it comes to the company's approach to sustainability. ""Whether consumers are buying more or less today, right now is actually not the key driver,"" he says. ""We want to become a low-carbon business. I have four children, I'm leaving this earth one day, I hope I can leave it in a better shape than maybe what we've kind of created in the last 50 years or so.""

The government brought about the change because a fall in Covid cases meant it was now ""much safer"" for care home residents to go outside. It had been threatened with legal action by the charity John's Campaign over the isolation requirement. The move, announced on Saturday, has now come into effect. On Tuesday, thegovernment's coronavirus dashboard,externalrecorded 1,946 new infections, as well as four deaths within 28 days of a positive test across the UK. The recorded number of deaths is often lower immediately after weekends and bank holidays due to reporting lags. More than 50 million Covid vaccinations have been given in the UK so far, with 34,667,904 first doses and 15,630,007 second doses. Jenny Morrison, co-founder of Rights for Residents - a group founded to end ""inhumane restrictions"" preventing relatives visiting loved ones in care homes - told BBC Breakfast the change would certainly make a difference for her family, saying: ""Mum's care home is near the seafront. On a nice sunny day, after 14 months where she hasn't been outside, it will be amazing for us to wheel mum down to the seafront and have a picnic. It will just be absolutely wonderful."" Jenny Morrison said it would be wonderful to take her mother outside But she said some care homes were ignoring the guidance, with some families being given good access for visits, either indoors or outside, but others not. She said family members needed to be seen not as ""just visitors"" but as ""essential components of people's care"". A petition has been delivered to the government, calling for the guidance on visits to be made legally binding. It also calls for relatives of care home residents to be given essential caregiver status by law, so they could continue to visit loved ones in case of another lockdown. David Finch, from Trowbridge, is hoping the care home where his wife Tricia, 74, lives will be implementing the changes. She has Alzheimer's and has been living at the care home since July 2020, yet her husband has never been inside. ""Trish hasn't seen her family properly since July,"" he said. ""The longer we go on with this separation, it's just deteriorating. I just need to be able to take her out, have a walk and feed the ducks. ""The trouble with the care home situation is because they're only guidelines, the care homes are frightened to death of implementing something that could cause them problems."" What do the new rulesfor Englandmean? Only trips deemed as low-risk - to places such as gardens or parks - are exempt from the isolation rule Residents will also be allowed to vote in person in the local elections on Thursday Residents must be accompanied by a member of staff or nominated visitor and they have to follow social distancing at all times They cannot meet in groups or go indoors - apart from to use toilets - and public transport should be avoided Overnight trips are not allowed and residents will have to self-isolate after attending medical appointments There are different rules in the UK's devolved nations, with residents in Wales able to leave homes where there is no Covid outbreak, without isolating on their return Scotland's guidance for care homes allows for residents to see loved ones outside of the care home, while rules for care homes in Northern Ireland vary by region Care home residents in England have been allowed one regular visitor since 8 March, in the first easing of lockdown. The daughter of another care-home resident spoke to BBC Radio 4's Today programme about the change in guidance. Wendy, from Essex, said: ""It's just been so tough. I feel like we've been forgotten and the families just feel so powerless. The visits have been so restrictive. ""It's been so difficult trying to have a simple conversation with my father through a screen."" She said the visits in care-home pods or gardens were only 20 minutes long, with both people wearing masks. ""They can't hear you, you can't hear them, you're watched as well - there's no privacy,"" she said. Wendy added that, as the only visitor allowed, ""You have this terrible responsibility to try to keep memories of everyone else alive."" Margaret, from Colchester, also in Essex, says her mother, who lives in a care home, no longer recognises her. She says her mother's age and frailty mean that meeting outside is not an option. She questions why she cannot have a ""meaningful visit"" sitting next to her mother inside the care home. ""I want to go and sit next to my mother and look her straight in the eye and say 'hello, I'm Margaret.'"" A blowy, rainy day in many areas means even though family and friends can now take care home residents for a walk in the park or to visit their garden, few are likely to venture out. And as the guidance was only published on Saturday, homes have had little chance to put in place risk assessments and any staff support required. Still, it is an important step forward for families who have become increasingly angry about the restrictions faced by residents of all ages as the rest of society opens up. Even when guidance is updated, some homes have chosen not to loosen restrictions. It is one of the reasons campaigners are presenting a petition to the prime minister today calling for one named relative or friend to be legally recognised as part of each resident's essential care team, so allowing them access to care homes whatever is happening. Janet Shepherd from Utterby, Lincolnshire, says the new guidance means her partner could visit their garden, but added: ""He's got dementia and coming-home trips would have to be on a progressive scale because it makes them anxious. ""I would like to spend more time with him during the day, seeing what he does and getting involved. Going for walks and taking picnics round and maybe taking a car trip. Coming home after such a long time might be too much for him."" Some have said there is not enough discretion for younger care home residents and there needs to be more easing of restrictions for them. Maggie Lyons, from Sheffield, said her 42-year-old son, who lives in a specialist care home for men with autism, is ""desperate to have some kind of life"". ""We, his parents, can't have him to our home for an overnight stay,"" she said. ""Young people in care homes are basically incarcerated. ""When my other children can visit me on 17 May he might not be able to. Yes, I can take him to a park or sit in the garden but that isn't what he wants to do."" GLOBAL SPREAD:How many worldwide cases are there? VACCINE:When will I get the jab? NEW VARIANTS:How worried should we be? QUARANTINE:Will I need to self-isolate in a hotel? Anna Knight, chair of the Dorset Care Homes Association and manager of Harbour House Care Home in Bridport, said: ""You can imagine how it would make you feel if you were completely imprisoned, as it were, in your home."" She said it had not just been difficult for residents but for families and staff members as well, adding: ""Everybody has really struggled."" This video can not be played Ruthie Henshall on care home visits: ""It is beautiful to see the joy in her"" Ms Knight said her care home was now putting plans in place to allow visits outside the home to happen. ""It's going to be fantastic,"" she told Today. ""I know the families are already excited."" She said the previous guidance had been ""sensible"" but now was the time to start ""learning to live with this"". Mike Padgham, who runs four care homes in North Yorkshire and is chair of the Independent Care Group, said the move represented limited progress. ""It's great news, but personally I think it could have come a bit sooner because people have not been able to have their freedom in care homes for well over a year,"" he said. He added there had not been enough notice given, saying: ""The public want to make arrangements and we're not quite geared up for it yet,"" he added. The government is expected to review the self-isolation requirement for other visits when it reaches the next stage of the road map for easing coronavirus restrictions.

Updates were brought to you by Doug Faulkner, Alexandra FouchÃ©, Francesca Gillett, Paul Kirby, Alex Therrien, Sophie Williams, James Clarke, Sarah Collerton and Claire Heald. And here's what's been happening around the world: Soon we will be bringing our coronavirus live page to a close for the day. But before we do, here is a round-up of the main UK stories from today: An 85-year-old woman who has not been outdoors for 14 months because of the pandemic has had her first trip out to get an ice cream. Julie Chuter had promised her mum Audrey they would get the biggest ice cream they could find when she took her to Tynemouth earlier. Audrey, who had been desperate to leave her care home, says: ""It's great to be out of the home and be outside, even if the weather is
rubbish! ""I love ice cream, it's my absolute favourite. I had to get one even
though it's cold and wet."" This video can not be played One of the most noticeable changes during the pandemic has been the wearing of face masks. But waste management systems are ""not equipped"" to handle the amount of plastic being thrown away - including from face masks, researchers say. Swansea University scientists say disposable face masks could be releasing chemical pollutants and plastics into the environment. They are calling for better regulation and more research into their disposal. Covid-19 restrictions in County Donegal, and across the Republic of Ireland, are due to ease from 10 May People in
Donegal have been urged not to partake in many of the Republic of Irelandâs post-lockdown
freedoms because of the countyâs high Covid-19 rate. The countryâs Level Five restrictions are being eased from 10 May. But
Chief Medical Officer Dr Tony Holohan says people in Donegal ""will
continue to need to see themselves as having to protect themselves"". It
currently has the highest Covid-19 rate in the country. Last
week the chief medical officer spoke about his concerns about the levels of
non-compliance with Covid-19 restrictions in the county. On
Saturday, the chief medical officer and Irish health minster met with local politicians to discuss the infection rate. Read more here Future lockdowns in the UK are unlikely, a scientist whose modelling led to the first lockdown tells the BBC. Prof Neil Ferguson says the possibility of a further lockdown can't be completely ruled out because of the ""worst case scenario"" of a new variant emerging that evades the current vaccines. In this scenario, it is possible restrictions could be needed again to boost people's immunity to the virus, for example with tweaked vaccines. He says: ""Do I think it's likely to happen? No I don't. I think we are much more likely to be on a steady course now out of this pandemic, at least in this country."" Ferguson says the data on falling covid cases, hospitalisations and deaths is very encouraging. ""With the one caveat that we need to keep to watching those variants carefully and get more data on them, I am actually feeling very optimistic and that optimism has gradually increased as the last three months have unfolded, from a terrible situation we were in in January to a remarkably good situation now."" And he says life will begin to return to normal by early summer. Singapore has announced a series of new restrictions, after cases rose last week and several new clusters - including locally transmitted cases of new variants - emerged on the island. Measures - which kick in from 8 May -  include tighter curbs on social gatherings of five people, stricter border controls, as well as a ban on spectators at sporting events. Travellers arriving from most countries will be required to quarantine for three weeks instead of two. Indoor gyms and fitness studios will be closed, and more people will be required to work from home. These are the tightest local measures since the city-state started easing curbs in the middle of last year
after a partial lockdown. Only last week, it had been deemed the best place in the world to live in Covid times.  Social distancing rules on buses should be relaxed to cater for increased demand, a Scottish operator says. Current Scottish government guidance is for one metre physical distancing between people on all forms of public transport. But independent operator McGill's says the restrictions mean it isnow turning away people at peak times because its buses are full. Transport Scotland says the Scottish government has ""invested significantly"" to ensure public transport services are available during the pandemic and says capacity on public transport will still need to be managed as wider restrictions are eased. McGill's managing director Ralph Roberts says he is worried a ""healthy return"" of passengers will be stymied by the distancing rules not being eased quickly enough. Bus industry sources tell BBC Scotland that a number of operators are nearing capacity at peak times under existing social distancing rules and they fear people will be put off getting back to using buses if the situation worsens. With all the talk today of green lists and European holidays, you may want a reminder of what the rules are. Currently, it is illegal to go abroad for non-essential trips, with the restrictions in place until at least 17 May. Under the proposed ""traffic light"" system, countries will be rated green, amber or red. Countries on thegreen listwill have the fewest travel rules, but you will still need to take a private Covid test in your holiday destination before returning to England and takea private PCR test,externalon or before day two of your arrival in England. But you will not have to isolate unless the test on arrival is positive. Foramber countriesyou will need to take a Covid test before returning to the UK, self-isolate at home for 10 days and pay forPCR Covid testson days two and eight of isolation. Rules will be similar to those already in place forred listcountries and will require you to stay in a hotel for 10 days. You can read more about the ruleshere. As we reported earlier, the Indian Premier League - the richest franchise cricket competition in the world - has beensuspended after several players and staff tested positivefor Covid-19. The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) has no plans to arrange a charter flight for the England contingent in India, as it is the responsibility of the franchises to get the players and staff home. When the players do leave India, they will have to be tested before departure and upon arrival in the UK, and then quarantine in a hotel for 10 days. None of those connected to England are thought to have tested positive for Covid-19, but it is unknown whether any have been in close contact with those who have. An ECB spokesperson says: ""We are in close contact with our players and staff in India as arrangements are put in place for them to return home safely."" England's limited overs captain Eoin Morgan is among the England players who are in India, where he plays for the Kolkata Knight Riders. India's main opposition Congress party has urged the government to declare a nationwide lockdown,as the number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the country passed 20 million.

Demand for Pfizer's Covid vaccine could bolster its revenues for years, the US drugs giant has said. Pfizer said it was expecting ""durable demand"" for the vaccine, in a similar way as for flu vaccines. In the first three months of 2021, the vaccine generated revenues of $3.5bn (Â£2.5bn) as governments scrambled to try to contain the pandemic. Revenue from it is expected to account for more than one third of Pfizer's full-year sales this year. The forecast is based on already-signed contracts for 1.6 billion vaccine doses to be delivered this year. Read more here. The chief medical adviser to US President Joe Biden, Dr Anthony Fauci, has told the BBC that other countries must step up to help India through the current health crisis and to ramp up vaccination rates. ""The number of people needing hospitalisation and not being able to get a hospital bed, the lack of oxygen, the lack of equipment, it is really a very desperate situation. We really need to get a concerted effort of other countries to try and help India out. ""Not only to help them from outside to within, but to help them to be able to get their own situation (under control), namely to produce more vaccines, and to get people vaccinated. ""Only 2% of the population is fully vaccinated and about 9-10% have partial vaccination. For a country of so many  people, we've got to do better than that and we've got to do better than  that quickly, because that's going to be the solution. That's the intermediate and long-range solution."" North Korea
has warned its citizens that vaccines are not a cure-all solution to the Covid
pandemic. It comes
amid indications the reclusive state has failed to secure adequate vaccine
supplies. An editorial in a state newspaper references problems with vaccine programmes
in some countries and says North Korea must uphold its virus restrictions. The country
has not recorded a single case of the virus although last month it processed
24,000 tests. Experts
doubt this claim as the country shares a border with China â a highly used
trade route. Covax â the international vaccine
distribution scheme â has allocated 1.7 million vaccine shots to North Korea. The daily figures also show the number of people to receive both vaccine doses has risen to 15,630,007, while the number to have one jab is 34,667,904. A further 160 patients were admitted into hospital. A further four people have died in the UK within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test, according to thelatest government figures,external. There were 1,946 cases recorded. Yesterday, one death and 1,649 cases were reported.

"The inquiry will look at parties' use of social media as well as external influences Could the Welsh Parliament election have been used to spread disinformation online? A Senedd inquiry, supported by political parties, plans to investigate social media use after the election has taken place. Andy Regan, from the Institute of Welsh Affairs (IWA), said there was evidence even small nations' elections can be used to create discord. The probe will also look at whether the campaigns have broken any rules. Mr Regan, policy and external affairs manager at the IWA, said: ""People are very aware misinformation was a factor in the Brexit referendum, we have clear evidence, as well as in the 2016 US election where actors were apparently spreading information. ""How do we know this isn't happening in Wales? SIGN UP FOR WALES ALERTS:Get extra updates on BBC election coverage ""What's become clear is it's absolutely a factor in small nations' elections, not just globally significant elections. ""We can't say this is happening, but it's reasonable to say we should look at whether or not it is, because we don't know."" Mr Regan said there was a difference between disinformation - knowingly and deliberately misleading - and misinformation, which can be done sincerely by people who believe what they are saying is correct. ""Both are a problem and it's a problem when they're used to influence how people vote,"" he said. US election: Fake news becomes the news Russia 'meddled in all big social media' How disinformation spread in Brexit Facebook groups The world of misinformation and fake news ""I think this is something we were talking about before lockdown happened, the question of whether it is possible to hold a free and fair election given this social media activity. I think we probably would still have been saying this but it's going to be more prominent as a result of Covid. ""Social media can be a really positive tool, and a bigger part of everybody's life these days. What Covid has perhaps done in the context is give us quite an obvious thing to talk about, in terms of where that misinformation can fit."" This video can not be played Online attention battle heats up before election Mr Regan said it was considered fair to critique the way governments had handled the pandemic and lockdowns on social media, but where it crossed the line would be misinformation, for example, about vaccines. ""Nobody was happy about lockdown, there are opinions about how it should be approached by governments and it's fair to criticise, what's not correct or accurate is claims that lockdowns don't work or vaccinations don't work, claims that aren't true.,"" he said. ""Another issue would be the targeting of individual candidates with factually inaccurate smears, pile-ons orchestrated as an attempt to create negative messages around a particular person which is a particular problem for women and BAME candidates and can be a disincentive to even stand in the first place."" WHO SHOULD I VOTE FOR? Compare what the parties are promising to do in Wales with ourelection manifesto guide. There are existing rules and regulations over the activities of political parties in an election, but Mr Regan said there was a grey area when it came to external influences using an election to simply create discord rather than trying to influence the outcome. He called for existing rules to be updated to keep up with the developments in social media and its influence on elections. ""The issue of abuse and harassment falls into the scope of existing rules and regulations, but there are shades of grey when it comes to those trying to sow discord and disunity because it's a destabilising agenda rather than to influence an election,"" he added. ""It's harder to pin down where rules have been broken, when it falls outside the remit of party campaigns and goes much wider. ""We know this is a feature of the modern election but is it something we should just accept and allow to become normalised?"" Andy Regan says inaction could mean worse disinformation in future elections Mr Regan said ""deep fake videos"", technology which creates videos of figures such as Barack Obama saying something they have not said, could become a much bigger problem in future. ""They are very convincing, and if you don't take a stand now then next time the kind of activity could be much more worrying than a text or a picture that isn't true,"" he said. ""And the use of outside actors is troubling, whatever the agenda, it is something they can use to draw attention to other agendas, not just party politics. ""The fact is the parties have all come out so strongly for this inquiry, which is probably quite brave of them, and we really welcome the Senedd taking this approach."" WALES ELECTION: THE BASICS What's happening?On 6 May, people will vote to elect 60 Members of the Senedd (MSs). The party that can command the support of a majority of MSs will form the Welsh government.Find out more here. What powers does the Senedd have?MSs pass laws on aspects of life in Wales such as health, education and transport - and have some tax powers. Mr Regan said while the inquiry would look at the activities of candidates and political parties, it was not seeking to overturn any result. ""The most high profile example of this would be the Brexit referendum, and the calls for this to be looked into which are associated with the Remain side - but would Brexit have won anyway? ""The thing is that there are rules already that people should be complying with and in some cases those rules are out of date, so it's not going to be about saying there would be a different result if that hadn't taken place."" Rather than punishing any party or candidate for alleged rule-breaking or ""deeply questionable"" use of social media, Mr Regan said the aim would be to raise awareness among the public about misinformation ""and make people more sophisticated consumers of information they find online"".

""On a Welsh level, we should have a proper commitment to our election having integrity, and it's about the Senedd taking control of the integrity of its own election and being clear if this is a problem.""

"Politicians are pushing their messages to the voters ahead of the Senedd election on Thursday Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer is visiting seats in north east Wales which fell to the Tories at the last general election Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies will also be in north Wales where the party hopes to repeat its 2019 gains Plaid Cymru's Liz Saville Roberts is also campaigning in key areas of north Wales Welsh Lib Dem leader Jane Dodds will be focusing her attention on mid Wales Natalie Grice, George Herd and Andy Roberts Thanks for following our live coverage of today's campaigning for the Welsh Parliament election on Thursday. We'll be back tomorrow for the final day of the campaign. Join us then. Jane Dodds has been on the campaign trail in Aberaeron, Ceredigion The Welsh Liberal Democrat leader says the response to her party's recovery message is ""really good"". Jane Dodds has been out on the campaign trail in Aberaeron, in Ceredigion. ""Our priority to put recovery first is going down really well on the doorstep,"" she said. ""We are the  party putting recovery first - recovery of the economy, mental health, and recovery for our planet."" The only Lib Dem member of the last Welsh Parliament was Kirsty Williams, who served as education minister in the Labour-led  government and is standing down from her seat of Brecon and Radnorshire after 22 years in the Senedd. ""We are not taking votes for granted,"" insisted Ms Dodds. ""Of course we want  to keep Brecon and Radnorshire, but weâve also always done well in regional seats."" Andrew RT Davies is hoping to take seats off Labour while defending Tory seats against a Plaid Cymru challenge Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies has been out on the doorstep in the Aberconwy constituency - one of the top targets for Plaid Cymru in north Wales. The Tories hold the seat, but held only a 754 vote majority over Plaid in the 2016 Senedd election. They took the seat from Plaid back in 2011 - so this has always been a fiercely contested battle, with a constituency spanning the coastal resort of Llandudno, up to the rural Conwy Valley town of Llanrwst. Last week Prime Minister Boris Johnson stopped off in Llandudno - today, the Welsh leader headed to the region, stating north Wales ""has been too often ignored by Labour"". ""We have a clear plan to tackle our creaking infrastructure and fragile economy, and create jobs, prosperity and opportunity for people across Wales,"" he said. The Wales Green Party is asking Labour voters not to place a
âwasted voteâ for the party on the regional list. âOur focus in the days leading up to the election is getting
out on door steps and on the phone to as many voters as possible, talking about
our plans to transform Wales,â said Anthony Slaughter, the party's leader in Wales. âAnother big priority for us is explaining to traditional
Labour voters that Labour is a wasted vote on the regional list, and that in
almost all of Wales, the last seat on the regional list will be between the
Greens, Abolish and the Tories. âIt makes sense for Labour voters to lend their vote Green
on the regional list,â he added. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Ahead of Thursday's Senedd election, the employers' organisation said parties had not addressed key issues, claiming financial support had so far been a ""short-term fix"". Monmouthshire coffee and gift shop owner Alison Baillon said the business rate holiday had helped keep them afloat - but their finances remain ""pretty sad"" for now. Former Plaid Cymru member of the Senedd Neil McEvoy is fighting this election as leader of a new party, Propel.

Daniel DaviesBBC Wales political correspondent In the three seats Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has been visiting in north Wales today, the party is defending majorities that are smaller than the number of votes polled by UKIP at the last Senedd election five years ago. The biggest study of its kind suggests the vast majority of 2016 UKIP voters went to the Conservatives at the general elections of 2017 and 2019 - you canread more about that here. If those people vote Tory again they could really help the party's Senedd group leader Andrew RT Davies. I spoke to an experienced Labour politician in this part of the world who has been out on the doorsteps during the shortened campaign. She sounded confident Labour's vote was holding up. But that may not tell you much about what is happening at the other end of the spectrum, where the Conservatives are trying to convince people to keep up the habit of voting Tory. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has been on the campaign trail in Wales Jamie Jenkins from Reform UK says the latest figures show low Covid rates ""are not leading to any real impact on hospitalisations"". The former Brexit Party says there should be no more lockdowns, claiming they have a devastating effect on the economy. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Parties are using targeted social media advertising to appeal to voters both across Wales and in specific areas. BBC Wales' Westminster correspondent Ione Wells explains. Adam Price thinks voters want 'a new direction' from someone else Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price has been campaigning in Neath, a seat in south Wales held by Labour in Cardiff Bay since devolution in 1999 and for more than a century at Westminster. But he said that in the last few days before polling day, people were ""making a decision now as families, and particularly traditional Labour voters, say they're coming over to Plaid because they feel it's time to give someone else a chance to take Wales in that new direction, with new ideas and new leadership that puts us on a different path"". Mr Price said Plaid Cymru would ""deliver opportunity for our young people, dignity for old people and give everyone in Wales the chance for a better life"". ""People are really inspired, I think, by our positive message of hope and change and belief in Wales, there's no problem in Wales that Wales cannot solve,"" he said. ""But we've got to believe in our own ability to change things, and that starts with the election of a Plaid Cymru government in a few days' time."" As the posters show, Neath has been a Labour stronghold for a century As well as the Welsh Parliament or Senedd election, you will also get the chance to vote for your local police and crime commissioner this Thursday. Use our postcode checkerto see which elections are taking place and which candidates are on offer in your area. Outside Wales, there are also elections to the Scottish Parliament, the London Assembly, the Hartlepool by-election, some English councils and directly elected mayors. Green Party candidates in the Senedd election are backing the idea of auniversal basic income, a weekly payment to everyone in Wales to help the post-pandemic recovery. Paid to everyone without a means test or requirement to work, the party's deputy leader Amelia Womack says it would replace a ""tired, broken benefits system where so many fall through the cracks"".

Carwyn Jones was first minister from 2009 to 2018 Former first minister Carwyn Jones has suggested that any
post-election coalition deal in Wales should take âa few weeksâ to agree. Mr Jones took over from Rhodri Morgan as first minister in 2009, when Labour
was already running the Welsh government in coalition with Plaid
Cymru. Labour governed alone after making gains in the 2011
election, but after the 2016 poll Lib Dem Kirsty Williams and former Plaid
Cymru leader Lord Elis-Thomas joined his administration. There is speculation that a new coalition could be needed if
Labour loses ground in Thursdayâs election, although Plaid Cymru have ruled out
a âsimple re-runâ of 2007-11 when they were the junior partner. Mr Jones told BBC Radio Walesâ The Leadersâ Lounge: âOnce everyone sees the numbers, everyone will be making
calculations, then there will be a game of chicken â who rings who first? 
And then the advisers will speak to each other first and prepare the
ground.  All that can happen in a situation like this."" Asked how long talks might take, he said: âExpect a few
weeks. ""If you have coalition negotiations, my view has always been you
have to have as much detail as possible in a coalition agreement. ""In
2007, we had a very detailed coalition agreement with Plaid, which meant that
really there wasnât much argument within that coalition â there was the odd
disagreement here and there but nothing public because everybody knew the
detail of the agreement. âIn 2010, the Tory-Lib Dem coalition [UK government] â I remember saying at
the time this is not a very detailed agreement, this is a recipe for people to
interpret it in different ways, and a recipe for chaos, and that âs the way it turned
out, to my eyes. âIf there is going to be a coalition  - nobody knows
that â best that it takes a few weeks to put together with a detailed agreement
than signing a piece of paper thatâs one side of A4.â Mr Jones stood down as first minister in 2018, and was standing down as MS for Bridgend at this election. You can hear more from him onThe Leadersâ Loungeon BBC Radio Wales at 1830 BST on Tuesday, and on BBC Sounds. Sir Keir Starmer (l) at Excelitas Technologies in St Asaph, Vale of Clwyd UK Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer emphasised the leadership
of his Welsh colleague Mark Drakeford on his visit to north Wales. Sir Keir visited Excelitas Technologies in St Asaph, in the
Vale of Clwyd â a seat the Conservatives won in Westminster at the 2019
general election. The company makes lenses and hi-tech goggles for the
military. The Labour leader told BBC Wales: âIt's very important to
reflect on Mark Drakeford and the way he has led Wales over the last 14 months
during this pandemic. âVery many people recognise that careful, reassuring way in
which he has led Wales through to a position now where the virus level is lower
in Wales than anywhere across the UK, third in the world on vaccines.â He said he and Mr Drakeford both want âmore power and
responsibility in Wales, decisions closer to people in Wales, a strong Wales in
a fair United Kingdomâ. He did not answer a question about whether he would be happy
with a deal with Plaid Cymru after the election directly. âWhat weâre fighting for is a Labour-led Welsh government to
continue the good work that has been done through the pandemic and lead us
through the recovery,"" he said. And asked whether it was the case that the allegations
against the prime minister were not cutting through with voters, Sir Keir said:
âI don't actually go along with this argument that says, well it's priced in it
may be that the prime minister is not being straight, but it doesn't really
matter. âBeing the prime minister of the United Kingdom is an
honour, itâs a privilege, and we should not ever accept that it's priced that
there should be sleaze."" Vaughan Gething (top right) took part in a discussion on Politics Live Wales' Health Minister Vaughan Gething has
called on the UK government to remain cautious as it prepares to open up
foreign travel in England. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has indicated
there will be some ""opening up"" of foreign travel on 17 May - but
said it was important to be cautious. Speaking on BBC Politics Live, Mr Gething
said there was ""nervousness about significantly liberalising international
travel in the middle of May"" amongst all four governments in the UK. ""The reality is, we know last
summer we reimported coronavirus into all parts of UK with foreign travel. ""The risks are not just about Covid
case rates increasing again but of the new variants of coronavirus that are
circulating in Europe and other parts of the world, and those may potentially
escape the vaccination response. âI understand it's difficult, but it's the
right thing to do to be cautious and avoid the potential harm that could come
if we do have coronavirus imported. ""Because if international travel starts
in England it affects all other part of the UK as well."" More details are expected this week to
confirm when and how international travel will restart in England. Neil Hamilton was the only remaining UKIP Senedd member UKIP Wales leader Neil Hamilton is campaigning in Merthyr
Tydfil today. A spokesman said the party was âstanding on a platform of
decency, honesty and fairnessâ. âTwenty two years of Labour government has devastated Wales and left
behind communities in the south Wales valleys and north Wales,â the spokesman
added. UKIP won seven seats at the last Welsh Assembly election in
2016. After a series of defections Mr Hamilton remained the only UKIP Senedd
member in the last term. There has never been a Welsh assembly election which has prompted half or more of the population to vote. The height came in the first election in 1999, with 46%.

Ione Wells took over BBC Wales News' Instagram to answer your election questions Voters go to the polls on Thursday to elect the new members of the Welsh Parliament. The election decides who forms the Welsh government, which is in charge of devolved matters including health and social care, education and transport. People have submitted questions about the election to BBC Wales' Westminster correspondent Ione Wells via Instagram. You can read the answers here. James Wells says there is ""no longer any serious pressure"" on the NHS in Wales from Covid Reform UK - previously known as the Brexit Party - has accused Welsh Labour of âdithering and delayingâ in easing Covid restrictions. The party, which says it will never hold another lockdown, said it is focused on reopening the economy. âWales is paying the costs,â said Reformâs James Wells. âYesterday one person with Covid died in the UK - in Wales there is no longer any serious pressure on the NHS from Covid. ""Total deaths in Wales over the past four weeks have been around 12% lower than you would expect for this time of year so why are so many sectors still not fully open? âEach day the cost of keeping business from fully reopening grows with a total bill from furlough alone around Â£2bn in Wales. ""Job losses are also contributing to the growing mental health crisis. This simply isnât good enough.â Reform UK are standing in a number of seats across Wales including all the regional lists.

""After a great deal of thought and a lot of work on our relationship, we have made the decision to end our marriage,"" the pair tweeted. They first met in the 1980s when Melinda joined Bill's Microsoft firm. The billionaire couple have three children and jointly run the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. The organisation has spent billions fighting causes such as infectious diseases and encouraging vaccinations in children.

The couple - pictured here in 2018 - have given billions to charity He made his money through the firm he co-founded in the 1970s, Microsoft, the world's biggest software company. The pair both posted the statement announcing their divorce on Twitter. ""Over the last 27 years, we have raised three incredible children and built a foundation that works all over the world to enable all people to lead healthy, productive lives,"" it read. ""We continue to share a belief in that mission and will continue our work together at the foundation, but we no longer believe we can grow together as a couple in the next phase of our lives. ""We ask for space and privacy for our family as we begin to navigate this new life."" Their 25-year-old daughter, Jennifer Gates, wrote on Instagram: ""It's been a challenging stretch of time for our whole family. I'm still learning how to best support my own process and emotions"". Melinda, now 56, joined Microsoft as a product manager in 1987, and the two sat together at a business dinner that year in New York. They began dating, but as Bill told a Netflix documentary: ""We cared a lot for each other and there were only two possibilities: either, we were going to break up or we were going to get married."" Melinda said she found Bill - methodical it seems even in matters of the heart - writing a list on a whiteboard with the ""pros and the cons of getting married"". They got married in 1994 on the Hawaiian island of Lanai, reportedly hiring all the local helicopters to stop unwanted guests flying over. Bill stepped down from Microsoft's board last year to focus on his philanthropic activities.

""They have built this from the ground up, over the last 20 years, they share a deep commitment to it,"" US author and journalistDavid Callahan told the BBC World Service. ""The work of the foundation is likely to go on. This is not some small family foundation that's going to fall apart because a marriage is falling apart,"" he said.

"Abbie and AJ were trying to film a trick for social media when the accident happened Dancer Abbie Quinnen, who was badly burned when a social media stunt went wrong, says she has received ""horrible"" messages from trolls on Instagram since the accident in January. Quinnen and her partner, ex-Strictly star AJ Pritchard, were due to film a trick with highly-flammable liquid when a fireball ""shot across the room"". The 23-year-old suffered second and third degree burns across her body. One of the Instagram messages said: ""You should have burned to death."" Recounting the initial incident to Victoria Derbyshire on BBC Radio 2's Jeremy Vine Show, Quinnen said she immediately screamed for help as the liquid caught fire uncontrollably. ""I was in shock and thinking, how can I survive this?"" she said. ""I rolled on the floor and that didn't work, so I grabbed a heavy blanket and started trying to put out the flames that way. ""AJ was getting damp towels in the meantime."" Although it was over in seconds, she said ""it felt like a lifetime"" and she kept asking Pritchard, ""Is my face going to be okay? Am I going to be okay? Will you still love me?"" The dancer suffered second and third degree burns to her face, head, neck, ear, chest and down her right side; she also lost some of her hair. She has had three skin graft operations, two of which involved using someone else's skin - called an allograft. ""I could have been blinded. I could have lost my hearing. I'm so lucky. It could have been even worse,"" she said. At one point the dancer was having to take 27 tablets a day to cope with the pain. Quinnen said she has been helped by many people on Instagram who have shared their own experiences of being burned. But others have posted messages including: ""You should have burned to death""; ""You're now going to look like a waxwork model""; and ""Don't go near your niece and nephew, you'll scare them"". ""It's so horrible, I just think it's really sad and I feel a bit sorry for them,"" Quinnen said. One of the hardest things for her was thinking she would never look the same again. ""When I was in hospital, staff tried every day to persuade me to talk to a therapist, but I just didn't want to, I wasn't ready. Even looking at the reflection of my face in my 'phone screen was hideous,"" she said. When eventually spoke with a counsellor, they asked her to look into a mirror to help her accept what had happened to her. ""I was hysterical,"" she said. She credits Pritchard with helping her recover, but initially would get upset when he was going out to work on the Channel 4 soap opera, Hollyoaks. ""He was able to get on with his life whereas I was in bed struggling with the consequences. I wasn't thinking straight, I know he was trying to be strong for me. ""Then I caught AJ crying once and he was trying to say 'I'm sorry, I'm sorry'. I was shocked because he'd obviously been keeping it in for weeks."" Quinnen said she has cried every day since her accident in mid-January up until last week, but is now trying focus on her goal of being back on stage, performing alongside Pritchard and his brother Curtis in their autumn tour. She also wants to start a petition to get videos like the one she and her partner were trying to recreate removed from YouTube so no one else gets injured like her. She says she has asked ""Why did this happen to me?"" and is very anxious. ""I don't go out too much and I'm constantly thinking something else bad is going to happen."" Qunnen also paid tribute to the NHS medics who cared for her. ""They are the closest thing to superheroes. My surgeon was amazing - I trusted her with my life. And all the nurses are so amazing."" Doctors have told her they won't know for another two years how much scarring she will have on her face in the long-term. As to her future with Pritchard, she says they've talked about marriage and children. ""AJ has been incredible. By my side the whole time, feeding me and cleaning my wounds,"" she added. ""I would love to get married to AJ. He is my dream man. I can't imagine my life without him.""

""Over the last 27 years, we have raised three incredible children and built a foundation that works all over the world to enable all people to lead healthy, productive lives,"" it read. ""We continue to share a belief in that mission and will continue our work together at the foundation, but we no longer believe we can grow together as a couple in the next phase of our lives. ""We ask for space and privacy for our family as we begin to navigate this new life."" Their 25-year-old daughter, Jennifer Gates, wrote on Instagram: ""It's been a challenging stretch of time for our whole family. I'm still learning how to best support my own process and emotions"". Melinda, now 56, joined Microsoft as a product manager in 1987, and the two sat together at a business dinner that year in New York. They began dating, but as Bill told a Netflix documentary: ""We cared a lot for each other and there were only two possibilities: either, we were going to break up or we were going to get married."" Melinda said she found Bill - methodical it seems even in matters of the heart - writing a list on a whiteboard with the ""pros and the cons of getting married"". They got married in 1994 on the Hawaiian island of Lanai, reportedly hiring all the local helicopters to stop unwanted guests flying over. Bill stepped down from Microsoft's board last year to focus on his philanthropic activities. The couples who split in the pandemic The couple established the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation in 2000 in Seattle The foundation focuses primarily on public health, education and climate change Its grants included some $1.75bn to vaccine initiatives and research during the Covid-19 pandemic In 2019, the foundation had net assets of more than $43bn Bill and Melinda Gates pumped more than $36bn into the foundation between 1994 and 2018 Source: Reuters news agency While the pair may branch off into separate charity initiatives, analysts say the work of the Gates Foundation is likely to continue. ""They have built this from the ground up, over the last 20 years, they share a deep commitment to it,"" US author and journalistDavid Callahan told the BBC World Service. ""The work of the foundation is likely to go on. This is not some small family foundation that's going to fall apart because a marriage is falling apart,"" he said. ""Bill and I are equal partners,"" she told the Associated Press in an interview in 2019. ""Men and women should be equal at work."" In her recent memoir The Moment of Lift, she wrote about her childhood, life and private struggles as the wife of a famous figure and and stay-at-home mother with three kids. Barack Obama awarded Bill and Melinda Gates the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2016 for their charity work Working together at the foundation had made their relationship better, she argued. ""He's had to learn how to be an equal, and I've had to learn how to step up and be an equal,"" she wrote. Apart from her work with the foundation she founded Pivotal Ventures, an investment company focused on women and families, in 2015. ""The world is finally waking up to the fact that none of us can move forward when half of us are held back,"" she said at the time. ""The data is clear: empowered women transform societies.""

"Sir Jeffrey Donaldson and Edwin Poots are in the running for the DUP leadership The vote to elect the next leader of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) will take place on 14 May, the party has said. Party officers met on Tuesday to discuss the procedure and timetable for the election of both a new leader and deputy leader. Agriculture Minister Edwin Poots and MP Sir Jeffrey Donaldson are bidding to succeed Arlene Foster. She steps down as DUP leaderon 28 May and first minister at the end of June. It is the first time in the party's 50-year history that a leadership contest has taken place. An announcement on the next leader is expected by 17:00 BST on 14 May, the party said. The meeting, to be overseen by party chairman Lord Morrow, will be conducted virtually. The party said contenders for both leader and deputy leader must submit their expression of interest by 17:00 BST on 6 May. The current deputy leader of the party is Lord Dodds. Mr Pootsbegan his leadership bid last Thursday, while Sir Jeffreyannounced his bid on Monday, the 100th anniversary of the formation of Northern Ireland. In a statement on Tuesday evening, Lord Morrow said the date of 14 May was chosen to reflect the fact that Covid restrictions are due to be reviewed at a meeting of the NI Executive on 13 May, and that the Queen's speech will take place in Parliament on 12 May. He said DUP representatives will be required to attend both commitments. ""In accordance with the constitution and rules of the Democratic Unionist Party, only party members, who are also members of the Northern Ireland Assembly and the House of Commons, are entitled to vote for the leader or deputy leader."" There are 28 DUP MLAs (Members of the Legislative Assembly) and eight MPs. South Down DUP MLA Jim Wells, who lost the whip in 2018 after he criticised the party leadership in the media, told BBC News NI he had received the letter that went to all DUP MLAs and MPs on Tuesday evening, informing them about the process for the vote. He said he was ""delighted"" his vote would count and reiterated he would be supporting Mr Poots. Arlene Foster will step down as DUP leader on 28 May Several senior DUP Stormont assembly members and the MP Paul Girvan have declared their support for Mr Poots. Speaking in the Northern Ireland Assembly on Tuesday, the Lagan Valley MLA confirmed he had ""no desire"" to hold the position of first minister should he be elected DUP leader. It is understood he would want to remain agriculture minister. Sir Jeffrey, the MP for Lagan Valley, has the backing of MPs Gavin Robinson and Jim Shannon as well as Education Minister Peter Weir and Junior Minister Gordon Lyons. Campaigners for both contenders claim their candidate has significant support within the party ranks. Sitting in the Stormont chamber on Tuesday, Arlene Foster cut a lonely figure on the benches where she once ruled. She was socially and politically distant from previously loyal supporters who signed a letter of no confidence in her leadership last week, forcing her to quit. Apart for the odd polite smile to those opposite wishing her well for the future, she showed no emotion. First Minister Arlene Foster (in yellow jacket) in the assembly chamber on Tuesday As she exited the chamber, one of the men who wants to replace her as leader entered through another door. Unlike Mrs Foster, Edwin Poots shared the benches with those who have already expressed support for his leadership bid. The contrast was stark. In order to become party leader, a candidate must secure the support of at least 18 of the party's assembly members and MPs. Mrs Fosterannounced her decision to resignafter facing a revolt from DUP members last week. She had led the party since December 2015 and was appointed first minister of Northern Ireland the following month. DUP facing divisive leadership battle BBC News NI understands that she will sever her ties with the DUP when she stands down as first minister, with sources close to her saying she thinks it is no longer the party she joined. Mrs Foster did not take part in a Tuesday morning meeting with her assembly team. The first minister was in the assembly chamber later as Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill responded to questions to the Executive Office.

"Mr Johnson previously met with the Prime Minister of India at the 2019 G7 summit The prime minister has announced new trade and investment deals with India worth Â£1bn. It includes more than Â£533m of new investment from India into the UK, which is expected to create about 6,000 jobs. Downing Street said the new partnership would ""pave the way"" for a future UK-India Free Trade Agreement. ""The economic links between our countries make our people stronger and safer,"" said Mr Johnson. The deal, announced ahead of a virtual meeting with India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi, includes a Â£240m investment by the Serum Institute of India, which will support clinical trials, research and possibly the manufacturing of vaccines. Serum has already started phase one trials in the UK of a one-dose nasal vaccine for coronavirus, in partnership with Codagenix. What trade deals has the UK done so far? Boris Johnson to visit India in bid to boost trade ties Indian investment deals will create 1,000 new UK jobs each at health and tech firms Infosys, HCL Technologies and Mphasis. Some 667 UK jobs will be created at Q-Rich Creations, 500 jobs at Wipro and 465 at 12 Agro. ""Each and every one of the more than 6,500 jobs we have announced today will help families and communities build back from coronavirus and boost the British and Indian economies,"" said Mr Johnson. Trade Secretary Liz Truss told the BBC that the jobs would be created ""within the next year or so"". She said those commitments were ""very different"" from a free-trade deal, which the two governments will start negotiating on this autumn. Discussions will include lowering tariff barriers and new agreements on ""digital and data"". The announcement on 6,000 jobs ""is really the tip of an iceberg"" Ms Truss said. Trade between the UK and India is worth about Â£23bn per year, and the government hopes to double that by 2030. ""What we need to do is get the huge tariffs removed on products like whisky, which is over 100%; cars, which is over 100% - that is where the real opportunities lie for us,"" she said. The do that, the UK is likely to have to relax immigration rules between India and the UK, Ms Truss added. ""We've already made significant steps in improving the immigration regime with the post-study work visa. We've seen a massive rise in Indian students coming to the UK."" ""Business mobility is a key part of trade. Particularly as the UK and India are both very strong in services, you need to make sure you're able to get your professionals over to the country,"" Ms Truss added. In recent years, the UK has sold more to Belgium or Sweden than India. But the government hopes that closer ties with one of the most populous and fastest-growing major economies could have huge long-term potential - especially as tensions with China mount. It believes that this announcement, which boosts access to India for producers of British fruit and medical devices - and means investment in the UK from India's vaccine producers - is just a taste of what could be achieved. But economists warn that getting a full deal with Delhi that lowers tariff and non-tariff barriers won't be easy. India is likely, for example, to want UK entry visa requirements for its workers and students to be eased. Attempts by the European Union, Australia and New Zealand to strike free trade deals with India have all stalled. But as that nation grapples with the economic damage caused by the pandemic and the rising threat from China, it may now take a more pragmatic approach to brokering an agreement. Meanwhile, British businesses have secured export deals with India worth more than Â£446m, which are expected to create more than 400 British jobs. They include a Â£200m deal involving CMR Surgical, which will create 100 new UK jobs. The company's next-generation 'Versius' surgical robotic system - which helps surgeons perform minimal access surgery - will be rolled out to hospitals in India. Trade between the UK and India is already worth around Â£23bn a year, supporting more than half a million jobs, according to the government. Mr Johnson said: ""In the decade ahead, with the help of new partnership signed today and a comprehensive free trade agreement, we will double the value of our trading partnership with India and take the relationship between our two countries to new highs."" Trade body the CBI said the updated trade partnership ""shows the world the strength of our relationship"". CBI president Lord Bilimoria said the talks would ""unlock opportunities for businesses, boost job creation and growth across the country"". Mr Johnson had been forced to cancel a planned visit to Delhi as it battles with a brutal second wave of coronavirus cases. The visit was designed to foster closer ties between the two countries and had first been scheduled for January. It was delayed after the UK's higher wave of Covid infections over winter. A four-day trip was scheduled for April before being cut back to just one day in Delhi, before being postponed indefinitely last month, with India subsequently added to the UK's travel ""red list"". On Monday, authorities in Delhi called for helpfrom the army. The government wants it to run Covid care facilities and intensive care units. Across India, case numbers since the start of the outbreak are closing in on 20 million. In response to India's coronavirus surge, the British Asian Trust has raised more than Â£1.6m in the last week through its emergency appeal. What trade deals has the UK done so far?

"European Union leaders are discussing plans for non-essential overseas travel Proposals include allowing anyone who has had their final coronavirus vaccine jab two weeks beforehand to travel Boris Johnson has said the approach to foreign travel this summer will be sensible to avoid ""an influx of disease"" But the NHS app may not initially be available to show someone's covid status for travel, Downing Street says An announcement will be made ""fairly shortly"" but travel will resume when known to be safe, International Trade Secretary Liz Truss says India officially passes 20 million Covid infections but the government says cases are falling The Indian Premier League, the world's richest cricket tournament, has been suspended amid the country's crisis The UK records a further 4 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test and 1,946 lab-confirmed cases In England, care home residents can now leave their home for low-risk trips without having to self-isolate Sarah Collerton, Claire Heald and James Clarke Thanks for following our coverage of the coronavirus pandemic today. Updates were brought to you by Doug Faulkner, Alexandra FouchÃ©, Francesca Gillett, Paul Kirby, Alex Therrien, Sophie Williams, James Clarke, Sarah Collerton and Claire Heald. And here's what's been happening around the world: Soon we will be bringing our coronavirus live page to a close for the day. But before we do, here is a round-up of the main UK stories from today: An 85-year-old woman who has not been outdoors for 14 months because of the pandemic has had her first trip out to get an ice cream. Julie Chuter had promised her mum Audrey they would get the biggest ice cream they could find when she took her to Tynemouth earlier. Audrey, who had been desperate to leave her care home, says: ""It's great to be out of the home and be outside, even if the weather is
rubbish! ""I love ice cream, it's my absolute favourite. I had to get one even
though it's cold and wet."" This video can not be played One of the most noticeable changes during the pandemic has been the wearing of face masks. But waste management systems are ""not equipped"" to handle the amount of plastic being thrown away - including from face masks, researchers say. Swansea University scientists say disposable face masks could be releasing chemical pollutants and plastics into the environment. They are calling for better regulation and more research into their disposal. Covid-19 restrictions in County Donegal, and across the Republic of Ireland, are due to ease from 10 May People in
Donegal have been urged not to partake in many of the Republic of Irelandâs post-lockdown
freedoms because of the countyâs high Covid-19 rate. The countryâs Level Five restrictions are being eased from 10 May. But
Chief Medical Officer Dr Tony Holohan says people in Donegal ""will
continue to need to see themselves as having to protect themselves"". It
currently has the highest Covid-19 rate in the country. Last
week the chief medical officer spoke about his concerns about the levels of
non-compliance with Covid-19 restrictions in the county. On
Saturday, the chief medical officer and Irish health minster met with local politicians to discuss the infection rate. Read more here Future lockdowns in the UK are unlikely, a scientist whose modelling led to the first lockdown tells the BBC. Prof Neil Ferguson says the possibility of a further lockdown can't be completely ruled out because of the ""worst case scenario"" of a new variant emerging that evades the current vaccines. In this scenario, it is possible restrictions could be needed again to boost people's immunity to the virus, for example with tweaked vaccines. He says: ""Do I think it's likely to happen? No I don't. I think we are much more likely to be on a steady course now out of this pandemic, at least in this country."" Ferguson says the data on falling covid cases, hospitalisations and deaths is very encouraging. ""With the one caveat that we need to keep to watching those variants carefully and get more data on them, I am actually feeling very optimistic and that optimism has gradually increased as the last three months have unfolded, from a terrible situation we were in in January to a remarkably good situation now."" And he says life will begin to return to normal by early summer. Singapore has announced a series of new restrictions, after cases rose last week and several new clusters - including locally transmitted cases of new variants - emerged on the island. Measures - which kick in from 8 May -  include tighter curbs on social gatherings of five people, stricter border controls, as well as a ban on spectators at sporting events. Travellers arriving from most countries will be required to quarantine for three weeks instead of two. Indoor gyms and fitness studios will be closed, and more people will be required to work from home. These are the tightest local measures since the city-state started easing curbs in the middle of last year
after a partial lockdown. Only last week, it had been deemed the best place in the world to live in Covid times.  Social distancing rules on buses should be relaxed to cater for increased demand, a Scottish operator says. Current Scottish government guidance is for one metre physical distancing between people on all forms of public transport. But independent operator McGill's says the restrictions mean it isnow turning away people at peak times because its buses are full. Transport Scotland says the Scottish government has ""invested significantly"" to ensure public transport services are available during the pandemic and says capacity on public transport will still need to be managed as wider restrictions are eased. McGill's managing director Ralph Roberts says he is worried a ""healthy return"" of passengers will be stymied by the distancing rules not being eased quickly enough. Bus industry sources tell BBC Scotland that a number of operators are nearing capacity at peak times under existing social distancing rules and they fear people will be put off getting back to using buses if the situation worsens. With all the talk today of green lists and European holidays, you may want a reminder of what the rules are. Currently, it is illegal to go abroad for non-essential trips, with the restrictions in place until at least 17 May. Under the proposed ""traffic light"" system, countries will be rated green, amber or red. Countries on thegreen listwill have the fewest travel rules, but you will still need to take a private Covid test in your holiday destination before returning to England and takea private PCR test,externalon or before day two of your arrival in England. But you will not have to isolate unless the test on arrival is positive. Foramber countriesyou will need to take a Covid test before returning to the UK, self-isolate at home for 10 days and pay forPCR Covid testson days two and eight of isolation. Rules will be similar to those already in place forred listcountries and will require you to stay in a hotel for 10 days. You can read more about the ruleshere. As we reported earlier, the Indian Premier League - the richest franchise cricket competition in the world - has beensuspended after several players and staff tested positivefor Covid-19. The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) has no plans to arrange a charter flight for the England contingent in India, as it is the responsibility of the franchises to get the players and staff home. When the players do leave India, they will have to be tested before departure and upon arrival in the UK, and then quarantine in a hotel for 10 days. None of those connected to England are thought to have tested positive for Covid-19, but it is unknown whether any have been in close contact with those who have. An ECB spokesperson says: ""We are in close contact with our players and staff in India as arrangements are put in place for them to return home safely."" England's limited overs captain Eoin Morgan is among the England players who are in India, where he plays for the Kolkata Knight Riders. India's main opposition Congress party has urged the government to declare a nationwide lockdown,as the number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the country passed 20 million.

Demand for Pfizer's Covid vaccine could bolster its revenues for years, the US drugs giant has said. Pfizer said it was expecting ""durable demand"" for the vaccine, in a similar way as for flu vaccines. In the first three months of 2021, the vaccine generated revenues of $3.5bn (Â£2.5bn) as governments scrambled to try to contain the pandemic. Revenue from it is expected to account for more than one third of Pfizer's full-year sales this year. The forecast is based on already-signed contracts for 1.6 billion vaccine doses to be delivered this year. Read more here. The chief medical adviser to US President Joe Biden, Dr Anthony Fauci, has told the BBC that other countries must step up to help India through the current health crisis and to ramp up vaccination rates. ""The number of people needing hospitalisation and not being able to get a hospital bed, the lack of oxygen, the lack of equipment, it is really a very desperate situation. We really need to get a concerted effort of other countries to try and help India out. ""Not only to help them from outside to within, but to help them to be able to get their own situation (under control), namely to produce more vaccines, and to get people vaccinated. ""Only 2% of the population is fully vaccinated and about 9-10% have partial vaccination. For a country of so many  people, we've got to do better than that and we've got to do better than  that quickly, because that's going to be the solution. That's the intermediate and long-range solution."" North Korea
has warned its citizens that vaccines are not a cure-all solution to the Covid
pandemic. It comes
amid indications the reclusive state has failed to secure adequate vaccine
supplies. An editorial in a state newspaper references problems with vaccine programmes
in some countries and says North Korea must uphold its virus restrictions. The country
has not recorded a single case of the virus although last month it processed
24,000 tests. Experts
doubt this claim as the country shares a border with China â a highly used
trade route. Covax â the international vaccine
distribution scheme â has allocated 1.7 million vaccine shots to North Korea. The daily figures also show the number of people to receive both vaccine doses has risen to 15,630,007, while the number to have one jab is 34,667,904. A further 160 patients were admitted into hospital. A further four people have died in the UK within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test, according to thelatest government figures,external. There were 1,946 cases recorded. Yesterday, one death and 1,649 cases were reported.

The event is part of a government pilot where ticket-holders provided a negative Covid test to be allowed in. Overill said the couple had been fans of Blossoms since they met, and their music is a ""big part of the family"". The vaccine made by drug company Pfizer-BioNTech is set to be authorised for
children and teenagers between the ages of 12 to 15 from this week or early next week, according to US media reports citing government officials.

"Warren Buffett is 90 Investor Warren Buffett has confirmed that Berkshire Hathaway's vice-chairman, Greg Abel, will succeed him as chief executive. Mr Buffett built Berkshire Hathaway from a failing textile maker into a $628bn (Â£452bn) investment juggernaut. Although he is 90 years old, Mr Buffett has given no indication he plans to step down. However, there has been speculation for more than a decade about who will succeed him. Warren Buffett finally joins exclusive $100bn club Warren Buffett sells off shares in US airlines Billionaire fortunes hit record high during pandemic ""The directors are in agreement that if something were to happen to me tonight, it would be Greg who'd take over tomorrow morning,"" Mr Buffett confirmed to CNBC. Mr Abel helped build Berkshire Hathaway's energy unit into a major US power provider. Since 2018, the Canadian has been a vice-chairman,  overseeing Berkshire Hathaway's non-insurance businesses. Vice-chairman Charlie Munger may have tipped the company's hand by accident at Berkshire Hathaway's annual meeting over the weekend. When answering questions about the company's decentralised business model, Mr Munger emphasised its importance and said, ""Greg will keep the culture."" Mr Munger made no mention of Ajit Jain, another well-regarded contender for the job who had overseen Berkshire's insurance businesses. Mr Jain's age appears to have played a role in the decision. At 58 years old, Mr Abel is a decade younger than Mr Jain, and Mr Buffett told CNBC that Abel's relative youth was significant. ""The likelihood of someone having a 20-year runway though makes a real difference,"" he said. Mr Buffett is arguably the world's most successful investor. Berkshire Hathaway owns more than 60 companies, including insurer Geico, battery-maker Duracell and restaurant chain Dairy Queen. It also has major stakes in Apple, Coca Cola, Bank of America and American Express, among others. This video can not be played So what is Jeff Bezos going to do now?

"Warren Buffett is 90 Investor Warren Buffett has confirmed that Berkshire Hathaway's vice-chairman, Greg Abel, will succeed him as chief executive. Mr Buffett built Berkshire Hathaway from a failing textile maker into a $628bn (Â£452bn) investment juggernaut. Although he is 90 years old, Mr Buffett has given no indication he plans to step down. However, there has been speculation for more than a decade about who will succeed him. Warren Buffett finally joins exclusive $100bn club Warren Buffett sells off shares in US airlines Billionaire fortunes hit record high during pandemic ""The directors are in agreement that if something were to happen to me tonight, it would be Greg who'd take over tomorrow morning,"" Mr Buffett confirmed to CNBC. Mr Abel helped build Berkshire Hathaway's energy unit into a major US power provider. Since 2018, the Canadian has been a vice-chairman,  overseeing Berkshire Hathaway's non-insurance businesses. Vice-chairman Charlie Munger may have tipped the company's hand by accident at Berkshire Hathaway's annual meeting over the weekend. When answering questions about the company's decentralised business model, Mr Munger emphasised its importance and said, ""Greg will keep the culture."" Mr Munger made no mention of Ajit Jain, another well-regarded contender for the job who had overseen Berkshire's insurance businesses. Mr Jain's age appears to have played a role in the decision. At 58 years old, Mr Abel is a decade younger than Mr Jain, and Mr Buffett told CNBC that Abel's relative youth was significant. ""The likelihood of someone having a 20-year runway though makes a real difference,"" he said. Mr Buffett is arguably the world's most successful investor. Berkshire Hathaway owns more than 60 companies, including insurer Geico, battery-maker Duracell and restaurant chain Dairy Queen. It also has major stakes in Apple, Coca Cola, Bank of America and American Express, among others. This video can not be played So what is Jeff Bezos going to do now? In March, Mr Buffett joined the exclusive $100bn (Â£72bn) club after Berkshire Hathaway shares hit record levels. Microsoft founder Bill Gates, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Tesla's chief executive Elon Musk have also passed the milestone.

"This video can not be played Watch the best shots as Mark Selby beat Shaun Murphy to win the snooker World Championship Mark Selby claimed his fourth World Championship title with an 18-15 victory over Shaun Murphy at a sold-out Crucible Theatre. Selby, who led 14-11 prior to the final session, is now three Crucible crowns off Stephen Hendry's record of seven. Runs of 66, 68 and a superb 120 helped him break Murphy's resistance in a high-quality encounter. Selby, 37, collects Â£500,000 in prize money and moves up to second in the world behind Judd Trump. Selby not chasing records of 'all-time greats' Relive how Selby won his fourth world title 'Goosebumps time' - fans buzzing as Crucible hosts capacity crowd Full tournament results and prize money Having been perched at the top of the world rankings during the period in which he claimed three world titles in four years, Selby's dominance once looked unquestionable. And while those days appeared to have gone, his return to form under Chris Henry, who also coaches Murphy, and the quality of his all-round game suggests he is more than capable of continuing to win snooker's biggest prizes. Now level with Scotland's John Higgins on four, only Hendry (seven), Ronnie O'Sullivan, Steve Davis and Ray Reardon (all six) have won more world titles than Selby in the modern era. And while he is now likely to turn his attention to usurping Trump, Selby's 20th major ranking title also cements his place among the greats in Triple Crown events - equalling Higgins' tally of nine, placing him behind only Davis, Hendry and O'Sullivan. ""To win it once against Ronnie O'Sullivan for the first time was a dream come true - to win it four times is something I could only have dreamed of,"" Selby said on BBC Two. ""Every time you get to a world final you always try your hardest - it's such a tough tournament to get there and you never know whether it's going to be your last. ""My aim is to get back to world number one. You still have goals in your career. I'm going in the right direction."" With the coach of both players Henry an intrigued spectator, Selby had earlier maintained his control of the match in Monday afternoon's session. This video can not be played 'The Crucible roar like never before!' - capacity crowd for final The concluding sessions of the Championship marked a notable sporting milestone with a capacity crowd returning to a major UK sporting event for the first time since March 2020. And as well as adding a semblance of normality, the 980 fans brought a return of the Crucible roar and added to the nervous tension, particularly when Murphy threatened an improbable comeback - turning thoughts towards a first final-frame decider since Peter Ebdon's 18-17 win over Hendry in 2002 - with back-to-back centuries. With Selby on the verge of victory at 17-13, Murphy clawed himself back to 17-15 with a superb show of under-pressure potting, but a missed red down the left cushion when well placed ended his hopes of adding to his 2005 title. This video can not be played Watch the conclusion to an entertaining last frame at the World Snooker Championship ""Mark is super-granite, unfortunately for me,"" Murphy said on BBC Two. ""I started well but he went into super-hard mode. He broke me last night with that three-frame lead which was a tough lead to give him in a match of this calibre. ""Life has been difficult for everybody over the last 12 months but I want to say a very deep and personal thank you for every one of you who has bought a ticket over the last 17 days. ""Sport is nothing without fans and we've been thrilled to have everyone back and a full house tonight. It's been very tough for me this year with the travel restrictions but you've brought me back."" As well as the consolation of a runners-up cheque worth Â£200,000 and a Â£15,000 prize for the tournament's top break of 144 in his second-round clash with Yan Bingtao, Murphy can leave Sheffield with his head held high. Elaine Murphy had expressed her pride in her husband in a BBC interview earlier on Monday and those sentiments are likely to be shared by fans who were delighted by the raw emotion he showed at times as well as his attacking style.

"Calls for a second national lockdown have also come from business leaders and health experts India's main opposition party has called for a full national lockdown, shortly after the country passed more than 20 million Covid-19 infections. There has been a ""virtual collapse of health services"" and a lockdown is needed to ""break the chain"", a spokesman for the Congress party said. The prime minister is resisting the move due to the economic impact. India added more than 355,000 cases on Tuesday, down from more than 400,000 daily infections on 30 April. Cases are ""slowing down"", the government said, but testing numbers have also dipped meaning the true caseload could be far higher. India's Covid crisis: Your questions answered Deadly second wave spreads from cities to small towns Backlash after China Weibo post mocks India Covid crisis ""We are now forced - there is no option - [we] will have to resort to a national lockdown to break the chain, to restore some order in the health services,"" Pawan Khera, a spokesman for the opposition Congress party told the BBC on Tuesday. Rahul Gandhi, a senior Congress leader, said there was no other way to stop the spread of the virus. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Calls for a second national lockdown have also come from business leaders, international health experts and other senior politicians. Members of India's Covid-19 taskforce, which advises the central government, are ""pushing hard"" for a two-week lockdown, The Indian Express reported. Dr Anthony Fauci, America's top public health expert, described the situation as ""extremely serious"" and said a nationwide lockdown was needed alongside a massive vaccination drive and the construction of makeshift hospitals. The decision to impose restrictions in India is made by individual state authorities rather than the central government. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has said that states should only consider restrictions as ""a last option"". But many states have still introduced restrictions. The northern state of Bihar is the latest to have announced a full lockdown while the capital, Delhi, and the financial hub, Mumbai, are also under restrictions. Prime Minister Modi was heavily criticised last year for imposing a nationwide lockdown with less than four hours' notice. It caused a  humanitarian crisis as tens of thousands of migrant workers were left without work and forced to walk hundreds of kilometres to their home villages. Locked down India struggles as workers flee cities India's PM seeks 'forgiveness' over virus lockdown The lockdown also saw India's economic output fall by a record 24% between April and June 2020 compared to the same period a year earlier, and the government has said another national lockdown would have dire consequences for the economy. India's second wave has been fuelled by lax safety protocols and massive public festivals and election rallies. It has overwhelmed its hospitals and delays in testing, diagnosis and treatment - as well as a shortage of critical care beds and crucial drugs - have resulted in a spike in deaths. The country has so far reported more than 222,000 deaths due to the virus. But experts say India's Covid death toll is vastly under-reported. There have been very long lines at crematoriums, mass funeral pyres and cities running out of space to bury or cremate the dead. India's cases have risen over the past week, but at a slower rate than in previous weeks. And daily cases have fallen in Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra which are all hotspots of the crisis. Erratic testing, however, makes it hard to gauge the significance of these numbers. Insufficient testing has proved to be another issue. Health officials said there was ""cautious hope"" of some respite from the second wave. But Lav Agarwal, joint secretary of the health ministry, said progress needed to be sustained by ""containment measures at district and state level"". Experts have also said other hotspots are likely to emerge in the coming weeks as the pandemic moves through the country. Meanwhile, an oxygen shortage has shown no signs of abating and people in several hotspot cities, including Delhi, are struggling for treatment. A sluggish vaccination campaign has compounded the crisis. Since January, India has administered more than 157 million vaccine doses which ranks third in the world after China and the United States. But just over 10% of India's 1.4 billion people have had one dose and only about 2% have received both doses. Despite being the world's biggest producer of vaccines, India is facing a shortage of supplies. And vaccination rates are down. The chief executive of India's Serum Institute, the world's biggest vaccine manufacturer,has warned shortages will last for months,external.

"This video can not be played Emergency crews attended the collapse late on Monday near the Olivos station on the metro's 12 Line A metro overpass has collapsed in Mexico City as a train was travelling over it, killing at least 23 people, including children, the mayor said. Two train carriages were seen hanging from the structure, above a busy road. At least 79 people were injured, and seven are in a serious condition. One person trapped in a car underneath the wreckage was pulled out alive. This is the deadliest incident in decades in the city's metro system, one of the busiest in the world. Local media broadcast CCTV footage showing the overpass collapsing, sending up clouds of debris. The crash happened at around 22:00 local time on Monday (03:00 GMT) near the Olivos station on the metro's Line 12, in the south-east of the city. Mexico City Mayor Claudia Sheinbaum said an external company would investigate the cause of the incident. Earlier, she said it appeared a girder had given way on the overpass. The line, inaugurated less than a decade ago, will remain closed while a structural survey is carried out. Speaking at a news conference alongside the mayor, President AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador offered his condolences to the relatives of the victims and said that ""nothing would be hidden"" from the Mexican people. Residents had reported cracks in the structure after a deadly 2017 earthquake, according to local media. Mexico's El Universal newspaper says transport authorities made repairs following the reports. The incident happened on Monday night local time The injured were taken to local hospitals A crane was sent to the scene to stabilise the carriages amid concerns they could fall onto the road, which forced officials to temporarily halt rescue efforts at night. In chaotic scenes, anxious friends and relatives of those believed to be on the train gathered in the area. EfraÃ­n JuÃ¡rez told AFP news agency that his son was in the wreckage. ""My daughter-in-law called us. She was with him and she told us the structure fell down over them."" Gisela Rioja Castro, 43, was looking for her 42-year-old husband, who always takes that train after work and had not been answering his phone. She said the authorities had no information about him. ""Nobody knows anything,"" she told the Associated Press. Images show the site of the incident now and in 2019 A passenger, 26-year-old Mariana, told El Universal that she and other people trapped among the carriage's twisted metal managed to escape through a window. ""We only heard a loud thunder, and everything fell apart,"" she said of the moment of the incident. ""There were many people standing and sitting in the carriage, and when the carriage fell, we went flying and hit our heads on its roof."" The search operation had to be paused for some time amid fears of a further collapse The area around the crash site has been sealed off One eyewitness told Mexico's Televisa TV network: ""Suddenly I saw that the structure was shaking."" ""When the dust cleared we ran... to see if we could help. There were no screams. I don't know if they were in shock,"" the witness said. Mexico City's metro system is one of the most used in the world, carrying tens of millions of passengers a week. In North America, only New York's subway carries more people every day. Yet the incident did not occur on one of the older lines, which have been through at least two major earthquakes in the past 35 years. Rather it happened on Line 12, completed as recently as October 2012. There will be difficult questions for the mayor's office to come about the construction of the line, including for several former mayors. They include Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard, who was in office when Line 12 was unveiled and who championed the metro's expansion. He called the accident a ""terrible tragedy"". However, those questions must wait until later. The moment now is solely about the rescue operation as Mexicans pray the number of victims does not rise any further. Last year,one person was killedand more than 40 injured in a collision between two metro trains in Mexico City. In 1975, two underground trains collided, killing 31 people. Were you in the area?

"Funeral pyres have been burning non-stop in Varanasi The region around Varanasi, one of the holiest cities in the world for Hindus, is among the worst affected by the second wave of coronavirus sweeping India. Many angry citizens of the region, in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, are now asking where their MP, Narendra Modi - India's prime minister - is in their hour of need. India's devastating second wave has pushed the country's total number of infections to 20 million and the death toll to more than 220,000. In Varanasi, with the health infrastructure swamped, patients can no longer find hospital beds, oxygen, or ambulances, and getting a Covid test can take up to a week. In the past 10 days, most pharmacies have run out of basic medicines like vitamins, zinc and paracetamol. ""We are inundated with calls saying help us get a bed or oxygen,"" said a local medical professional, who did not want to be named. ""With the most basic medicines in short supply, people are even taking expired drugs,"" he said. ""They say it's a little less effective, but at least it's something."" City residents say the first signs of trouble became visible in March. As cases spiked in Delhi and Mumbai and authorities there began imposing restrictions, migrant workers began returning home to their villages in and around Varanasi on overcrowded trains, buses and trucks. Many came home for the Holi festival on 29 March or to vote in the village council elections on 18 April - held against advice from experts. Reports saymore than 700 teachers on poll duty died,externalin the state and the elections helped spread the virus. Varanasi's hospitals were soon overwhelmed and people left to fend for themselves. Rishabh Jain, a 25-year-old businessman based in the city, told the BBC that when his 55-year-old aunt fell sick he had to drive 19 miles (30km) every day to queue for up to five hours to refill an oxygen cylinder. ""We panicked when her oxygen levels fell below 80,"" he said. ""We couldn't find a hospital bed so the family started phone bashing to find an oxygen cylinder. We tried 25 numbers for 12 to 13 hours and finally with help from social media and the district administration, we managed to get a cylinder. She's recovering now."" Migrant workers have returned to their villages from Mumbai and Delhi in overcrowded trains, buses and trucks in recent weeks Alarmed by the situation, the Allahabad high court on 19 April ordered a week's lockdown in Varanasi and four other cities in the state, saying the pandemic had ""virtually incapacitated our medical infrastructure"". The state refused to enforce it and challenged the order in the Supreme Court, arguing it had to ""protect both lives and livelihoods"". Critics now say the government has failed to do either. With the district administration imposing intermittent weekend curfews and with most businesses and shops shut from fear, thousands are losing their livelihoods and the virus is still spreading. Varanasi has so far recorded 70,612 infections and 690 deaths. But 46,280 - or 65% - cases were recorded since 1 April. The official Covid death toll for the district hovers most days around 10-11. On Sunday, the government data put it at 16. But everyone I spoke to in Varanasi dismissed these numbers as a fiction. A long-time city resident, who lives close to the Harishchandra and Manikarnika ghats - the two main cremation areas on the banks of Ganges river - says funeral pyres have been burning non-stop for the past month. 'Wherever you look, you see ambulances and bodies' Deadly Covid wave rips through small-town India Earlier, the two locations between them would have 80-90 cremations a day, but for the past month, the resident said, he believed the number has risen to roughly 300-400 a day. ""How do you explain this increase?"" he asked. ""These people are also dying of something? Most reports say they had a cardiopulmonary failure. How are so many people, including young healthy individuals, suddenly dying from a heart attack?"" A recent video shared by a Varanasi resident showed corpses lined up on either side of a narrow lane leading up to the cremation ground, stretching up to a kilometre. The authorities opened two new cremation grounds about 10 days ago, but reports say they are operating around the clock. The tragedy has not stopped at the city of Varanasi: the second wave has made deep inroads into smaller towns and remote villages in the state. Sudhir Singh Pappu, chief of Chiraigaon block, a cluster of 110 villages with a population of 230,000 on the outskirts of Varanasi, told the BBC that each village had reported five to 10 deaths in recent days. In some villages, he said, the toll was as high as 15 to 30. ""There is no hospital in the block, no oxygen and no medicines,"" he said. ""There's no space in government hospitals, private hospitals ask for a deposit of 200,000 rupees (Â£1,953; $2,705) to 500,000 rupees even before they look at a patient. We have nowhere to go."" This video can not be played Dr Singh: It's been a really, really, difficult time Kamal Kant Pandey, a resident of Aidhe village, said he thought the situation in his village was worse than in the city. ""If you tested everyone in my village of 2,700 people, at least half would be positive. So many people have cough, fever, pain in the lower back, weakness, loss of taste and smell,"" he said. Deaths in Aidhe were not making it onto the official database because ""there's no testing here"", said Mr Pandey, who was himself sick with the virus but made a full recovery. ""Imagine, this is the prime minister's constituency and even then we are gasping for breath,"" he said. Mr Modi has often talked about his ""special bond"" with the river Ganges, the ancient city of Varanasi, and the city's people. But as the virus has ravaged the city and the medical infrastructure collapsed, Mr Modi has stayed clear of his constituency. Residents have watched as theirMP made 17 trips to the key political state of West Bengal,externalbetween February and April, to campaign for the assembly elections there, which he lost badly on the weekend. An angry restaurant owner describedMr Modi's review meeting,externalto discuss the Covid crisis in Varanasi on 17 April - a day before the village council elections - as a ""farce"". ""The prime minister and the chief minister have gone into hiding, abandoning Varanasi and its people to their own fate,"" the restaurant owner said. ""The local BJP leaders are in hiding too. They have switched off their phones. This is the time people need them to help with a hospital bed or an oxygen cylinder but it's total anarchy here. People are so angry."" Mr Modi has been an MP from Varanasi since 2014 The blame ""lies with no-one else but the prime minister"", said Congress politician Gaurav Kapoor. ""The buck stops with him. The blame for every single death in the past month and a half in Varanasi - and in India - lies at his doorstep"" Mr Kapoor said. Like many city residents, Mr Kapoor too has suffered personally - he lost an aunt and an uncle a fortnight back to Covid and a friend's brother is now battling for life in a hospital. When I called him for the interview on Friday, he was isolating in a room at home, infected with coronavirus. He said when the numbers first began rising, he was inundated with calls seeking help in finding a hospital bed or an ambulance. ""But people have realised that it's pointless. The calls now are for oxygen cylinders,"" he said. The situation, by all accounts, is likely to get worse before it gets better. Varanasi is in chaos, and the picture on the outskirts and in the rural areas, where supplies are even more scarce, is worse. ""Doctors there tell me they don't even have oximeters, so patients are dying in their sleep when their oxygen levels plummet,"" said the owner of a diagnostic centre in Varanasi. ""When my wife and child were infected, I called our doctor and did everything he advised. But what about the illiterate man in the village who has no doctor on his speed dial? You know how he lives? He lives by God's mercy.""

"Hospitals in Delhi continued to send desperate messages for emergency oxygen supplies through the night on Sunday, warning that patients are at risk. The crisis started two weeks ago but shows no signs of abating. At least 12 patients, including a doctor, died when a prominent hospital ran out of oxygen on Saturday. Outside hospitals, families of patients who can't find a bed are struggling to get hold of portable cylinders - sometimes standing in queues for up to 12 hours. Several big hospitals in Delhi are relying on daily oxygen supplies but they are not getting enough to keep some as backup in case of emergency. One doctor described the situation as frightening, explaining: ""Once you've used up your main tank, there is nothing to fall back on."" The situation is worse still in small hospitals that don't have storage tanks and have to rely on big cylinders. And the oxygen crisis comes as coronavirus cases continue to surge. Delhi alone reported more than 20,000 new infections and 407 deaths on Sunday. Indians' desperate wait for Covid jab to get longer Delhi running out of space to cremate Covid dead Deadly Covid wave rips through small-town India India, meanwhile, over the weekendrecorded its highest daily coronavirus death toll since the pandemic began, and became the first country to register more than 400,000 new cases in a single day. Dr Gautam Singh, who runs the Shri Ram Singh hospital, says he has 50 Covid beds and space for 16 ICU patients, but has had to refuse admissions as there is no guarantee of oxygen supply. He has put out a number of SOS calls in the past few days, getting oxygen just in time to avoid disaster. ""It's a battle we are fighting every day,"" he says. ""Half of my hospital staff are on the road with cylinders to get them filled every day, going from one place to another."" Below is a recent heart-breaking appeal from him that I tweeted.

Dr Singh says the possibility of patients dying without oxygen in the hospital stops him from sleeping. ""I should be concentrating on treating my patients, and not running around to get oxygen,"" he says. Other hospital owners are also facing the same ordeal. One woman whose family runs a hospital in Delhi says there was no coordination among the authorities when the crisis started. ""For those few days, we had no idea who was the relevant person to contact and who had the authority to resolve the issue,"" she recalls. She says the situation is ""slightly better now"" but there is still uncertainty over the supply which is affecting their ability to admit more patients. ""Each time someone reaches out asking if I have a lead for an oxygen bed, I feel terrible saying no because I don't."" People are waiting for up to 12 hours to get a cylinder filled SOS calls from hospitals, particularly small ones that rely on cylinders and don't have a storage tank, come almost every day. Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has repeatedly said that the city was not getting enough oxygen from the federal government, which allocates oxygen quotas to states. Federal officials say there is no shortage of oxygen, but that the challenge has come from transportation. Some charitable organisations are helping those who can't get a bed and cant afford to buy a cylinder Delhi's high court on Saturday said ""enough is enough"". ""You [the government] have to arrange everything now. You have made the allocations. You have to fulfil it,"" it said. But the situation on the ground is still dire. ""People are paying a price for the political wrangling between the state and federal government. Sometimes the price is their life,"" one analyst said. Families who have managed to find a bed are also under extreme stress because of the uncertainty over oxygen supplies. The last 48 hours have been excruciating for Altaf Shamsi. He and his entire family tested positive for Covid-19 last week. His pregnant wife became seriously ill and had to be moved to a hospital where she gave birth to a girl on Friday. A few hours after a complicated birth, she had to be put on a ventilator, where she remains in a critical condition. Altaf was then told that his father had died in another hospital, while at the same time the hospital where his wife and baby are in an ICU said it was running out of oxygen. The hospital eventually got a day's worth of emergency supply, but Altaf is worried about issues arising again. ""Who knows what will happen tomorrow?"" he says. Allow Twitter content?

And in addition to concerns over oxygen, the hospital has been asking him to move his wife to another facility, saying they do not have sufficient staffing. It means he has been left to monitor his wife's oxygen levels and fever. ""You can't even imagine the pain I am going through,"" he says. Portable oxygen cylinders are the only way for patients in a serious condition to keep breathing at home when they can't find a hospital bed - a major issue in Delhi. Abhishek Sharma's father's oxygen levels started dropping on Saturday. He rushed to the market to get him a cylinder. After going to more than a dozen shops, he found a small cylinder which was good enough to last just six hours.  He later went out and paid $944 (Â£683) to buy a big cylinder but it was empty. He took it to several filling stations but only one was willing to help and the queue was very long. ""With each passing minute in the queue, my father was running out of oxygen. I couldn't ask anybody to let me jump the queue as everybody was in the same situation. I got the cylinder refilled after six hours in the line, but tomorrow I will have to do the same again,"" he says. ""I shudder to think what will happen if I am not able to get the cylinder refilled."" Public policy and health systems expert Dr Chandrakant Lahariya says the government had been warning about ""the potential crisis"" but did not take any action. A parliamentary standing committee on health  warned about inadequate supply of oxygen,externaland ""grossly inadequate"" government hospital beds in November. This video can not be played The BBC's Yogita Limaye reports from a hospital in Delhi, which is running low on beds and oxygen Dr Lahariya says the medical oxygen crisis in India was caused by a lack of planning in fixing the distribution and transportation networks. But many are shocked that two weeks after the crisis began, patients in India's capital are still gasping for breath, and there seems to be no end in sight. In the face of the crisis, concerned citizens have been stepping in to help out those in distress. Among the famous faces lending support are social activist and politician Tehseen Poonawalla, politician Dilip Pandey, activist and politician Srinivas B V and actor Sonu Sood. Mr Poonawalla has been helping small hospitals when they are about to run out of oxygen. He says he is ""connecting those in need with those who are in a position to help"". ""We have set up a war room where a small team is working with me. I am just calling up people who I know - some of whom are in other states but are eager to help,"" he says. Crematoriums in Delhi are running day and night But he says ""the situation is becoming more dire with each passing day"". ""The government needs to step in and take charge because people like me don't have infinite resources to help every person or hospital in need."" The woman whose family runs a hospital in Delhi echoed these concerns. ""I can't sleep at nights thinking that those people who died because of a lack of oxygen could have been saved. Many of them have families, some have small children. How will we ever explain to them what happened when they grow up and ask questions?""

"Politicians are visiting constituencies around Wales ahead of Thursday's vote Parties are focusing their campaigning on key north Wales battlegrounds with just two days to go before the Welsh Parliament election. Labour's Sir Keir Starmer visited Vale of Clwyd, Delyn and Wrexham, constituencies that the Tories gained from Labour at Westminster in 2019. Welsh Conservatives' Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies and Plaid's Liz Saville Roberts are also in the north. The Welsh Liberal Democrats are in Ceredigion. SIGN UP FOR WALES ALERTS:Get extra updates on BBC election coverage Sir Keir visited a military equipment manufacturer in St Asaph in the Vale of Clwyd constituency - a seat held by Labour at Senedd level but by the Conservatives in Westminster. It was one of six seats the Conservatives won from Labour at the Westminster election two years ago. Sir Keir said it was his ""job"" to ""rebuild trust"" after the party ""lost very badly in December 2019"". Sir Keir Starmer visited Excelitas Technologies in St Asaph, Vale of Clwyd Speaking to BBC Wales he asked voters to ""reflect"" on Welsh Labour's Mark Drakeford ""and the way he has led Wales over the last 14 months during this pandemic"". ""Very many people recognise that careful, reassuring way in which he has led Wales."" As it happened: Final week of the campaign He said he and Mr Drakeford both wanted ""more power and responsibility in Wales, decisions closer to people in Wales, a strong Wales in a fair United Kingdom"". Asked whether he would be happy if Labour worked with Plaid after the election, he added: ""What we're fighting for is a Labour-led Welsh government to continue the good work that has been done through the pandemic and lead us through the recovery."" In the three seats Sir Keir Starmer is visiting today, Labour is defending majorities that are smaller than the number of votes polled by UKIP at the last Welsh parliament election five years ago. Thebiggest study of its kindsuggests the vast majority of 2016 UKIP voters went to the Conservatives at the general elections of 2017 and 2019. If those people vote Tory again they could really help Andrew RT Davies. I spoke to an experienced Labour politician in this part of the world who has been out on the doors during the shortened campaign. She sounded confident Labour's vote was holding up. But that may not tell you much about what is happening on the other side of the spectrum, where the Conservatives are trying to convince people to keep up the habit of voting Tory. The incumbent first minister Mark Drakeford, meanwhile, has spent Tuesday visiting the constituencies of Rhondda, Llanelli and Bridgend. Bridgend is held by the Conservatives in Westminster but Labour in the Senedd, while Plaid Cymru is hoping to capture Llanelli from Labour. Plaid holds Rhondda - which Labour is campaigning to win back. While campaign director Ms Saville Roberts was campaigning in Aberconwy in the north, Plaid leader Adam Price was campaigning in Neath, a seat held by Labour in Cardiff Bay since devolution in 1999 and for more than a century at Westminster. He claimed voters - ""particularly traditional Labour voters"" - were ""saying they're coming over to Plaid because they feel it's time to give someone else a chance to take Wales in that new direction with new ideas and new leadership that puts us on a different path"". His party, said Mr Price, would ""deliver opportunity for our young people, dignity for old people and give everyone in Wales the chance for a better life"". ""People are really inspired, I think, by our positive message of hope and change and belief in Wales, there's no problem in Wales that Wales cannot solve."" WALES ELECTION: THE BASICS What's happening?On 6 May, people will vote to elect 60 Members of the Senedd (MSs). The party that can command the support of a majority of MSs will form the Welsh government.Find out more here. What powers does the Senedd have?MSs pass laws on aspects of life in Wales such as health, education and transport - and have some tax powers. Welsh Conservative Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies was campaigning in the Aberconwy constituency - a target for Plaid Cymru in north Wales. The Tories hold the seat, but held only a 754-vote majority over Plaid in the 2016 Senedd election. Mr Davies said north Wales ""has been too often ignored by Labour"". ""We have a clear plan to tackle our creaking infrastructure and fragile economy, and create jobs, prosperity and opportunity for people across Wales,"" he said. Adam Price campaigned in Neath on Tuesday Welsh Liberal Democrat leader Jane Dodds was in Ceredigion on Tuesday. ""The last year has brought into sharp focus the significant challenges in our rural economy,"" she said. ""From poor digital and transport connectivity, housing costs, and the challenges of running small businesses, rural Wales faces a difficult period ahead. ""Welsh Liberal Democrats are fighting this election with pledges to invest in tackling broadband and mobile phone connectivity to help both businesses and those choosing to work remotely."" Janet-Finch Saunders and Andrew RT Davies were canvassing in Penrhyn Bay The leader of the Abolish the Welsh Assembly Party (ATWAP) said voters were telling the party ""we need UK support, not more and more devolution"". Richard Suchorzewski, leader of ATWAP, said: ""This week speaking to businesses in north Wales, I have heard how their prospects have been hit by the Welsh Assembly with low investment, poor transport infrastructure and less Covid financial support than England. ""In the valleys, where Abolish received the support of Nigel Copner, who almost won Blaenau Gwent for Plaid Cymru last time, people are telling us we need UK support, not more and more devolution."" Reform UK accused Welsh Labour of ""dithering and delaying"" in easing Covid restrictions. ""Wales is paying the costs,"" said Reform's James Wells. ""Each day the cost of keeping business from fully reopening grows with a total bill from furlough alone around Â£2bn in Wales. Job losses are also contributing to the growing mental health crisis. This simply isn't good enough."" The Wales Green Party asked Labour voters not to place a ""wasted vote"" for the party on the regional list. The party said over the next couple of days Amelia Womack would be campaigning in Newport and surrounding areas, while Anthony Slaughter would be between Barry, Penarth and Cardiff. Mr Slaughter said a ""big priority for us is explaining to traditional Labour voters that Labour is a wasted vote on the regional list"", adding: ""It makes sense for Labour voters to lend their vote Green on the regional list."" UKIP Wales leader Neil Hamilton was campaigning in Merthyr Tydfil on Tuesday. A spokesman said the party was ""standing on a platform of decency, honesty and fairness"". ""Twenty-two years of Labour government has devastated Wales and left behind communities in the south Wales valleys and north Wales,"" the spokesman added. UKIP won seven seats at the last Welsh Assembly election in 2016. After a series of defections Mr Hamilton remained the only UKIP Senedd member in the last term.

"Calls for a second national lockdown have also come from business leaders and health experts India's main opposition party has called for a full national lockdown, shortly after the country passed more than 20 million Covid-19 infections. There has been a ""virtual collapse of health services"" and a lockdown is needed to ""break the chain"", a spokesman for the Congress party said. The prime minister is resisting the move due to the economic impact. India added more than 355,000 cases on Tuesday, down from more than 400,000 daily infections on 30 April. Cases are ""slowing down"", the government said, but testing numbers have also dipped meaning the true caseload could be far higher. India's Covid crisis: Your questions answered Deadly second wave spreads from cities to small towns Backlash after China Weibo post mocks India Covid crisis ""We are now forced - there is no option - [we] will have to resort to a national lockdown to break the chain, to restore some order in the health services,"" Pawan Khera, a spokesman for the opposition Congress party told the BBC on Tuesday. Rahul Gandhi, a senior Congress leader, said there was no other way to stop the spread of the virus. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Calls for a second national lockdown have also come from business leaders, international health experts and other senior politicians. Members of India's Covid-19 taskforce, which advises the central government, are ""pushing hard"" for a two-week lockdown, The Indian Express reported. Dr Anthony Fauci, America's top public health expert, described the situation as ""extremely serious"" and said a nationwide lockdown was needed alongside a massive vaccination drive and the construction of makeshift hospitals. The decision to impose restrictions in India is made by individual state authorities rather than the central government. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has said that states should only consider restrictions as ""a last option"". But many states have still introduced restrictions. The northern state of Bihar is the latest to have announced a full lockdown while the capital, Delhi, and the financial hub, Mumbai, are also under restrictions. Prime Minister Modi was heavily criticised last year for imposing a nationwide lockdown with less than four hours' notice. It caused a  humanitarian crisis as tens of thousands of migrant workers were left without work and forced to walk hundreds of kilometres to their home villages. Locked down India struggles as workers flee cities India's PM seeks 'forgiveness' over virus lockdown The lockdown also saw India's economic output fall by a record 24% between April and June 2020 compared to the same period a year earlier, and the government has said another national lockdown would have dire consequences for the economy. India's second wave has been fuelled by lax safety protocols and massive public festivals and election rallies. It has overwhelmed its hospitals and delays in testing, diagnosis and treatment - as well as a shortage of critical care beds and crucial drugs - have resulted in a spike in deaths. The country has so far reported more than 222,000 deaths due to the virus. But experts say India's Covid death toll is vastly under-reported. There have been very long lines at crematoriums, mass funeral pyres and cities running out of space to bury or cremate the dead. India's cases have risen over the past week, but at a slower rate than in previous weeks. And daily cases have fallen in Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra which are all hotspots of the crisis. Erratic testing, however, makes it hard to gauge the significance of these numbers. Insufficient testing has proved to be another issue. Health officials said there was ""cautious hope"" of some respite from the second wave. But Lav Agarwal, joint secretary of the health ministry, said progress needed to be sustained by ""containment measures at district and state level"". Experts have also said other hotspots are likely to emerge in the coming weeks as the pandemic moves through the country. Meanwhile, an oxygen shortage has shown no signs of abating and people in several hotspot cities, including Delhi, are struggling for treatment. A sluggish vaccination campaign has compounded the crisis. Since January, India has administered more than 157 million vaccine doses which ranks third in the world after China and the United States. But just over 10% of India's 1.4 billion people have had one dose and only about 2% have received both doses. Despite being the world's biggest producer of vaccines, India is facing a shortage of supplies. And vaccination rates are down. The chief executive of India's Serum Institute, the world's biggest vaccine manufacturer,has warned shortages will last for months,external.
