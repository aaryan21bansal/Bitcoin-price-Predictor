"This video can not be played Kirsteen Cooper says she does not want another innocent family to suffer A mother who was wrongly accused of trying to kill her disabled daughter by medical staff is to sue the hospital where the claims were made. Kirsteen Cooper was accused of causing infections and cutting a feeding tube attached to her daughter Baillie. This led to police charging her with attempted murder and access to her daughter being restricted for two years. After accusations were disproved by medics, the charges were dropped. Now Mrs Cooper, 42, is preparing a legal case against NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde. She claims she ""wanted to die"" after being wrongly accused. She was arrested and placed in a cell overnight after staff at the Royal Hospital for Children (RHC) in Glasgow wrongly accused her of stealing blood from her daughter Baillie ""to make her anaemic"". Speaking of the moment police arrested and charged her on 20 July 2017, Mrs Cooper told BBC News: ""My first reaction was that I didn't want to be here any more. ""Baillie and my children are my absolute world, my complete life. So to be accused of anything, let along the worst thing you could imagine in the world, and the most special person to you in the world, you just feel like your life is not worth living if that's what someone can accuse you of."" Baillie was four when she was first admitted to hospital The hospital accused Mrs Cooper of having suspected fabricated induced illness (FII), formerly known as Munchausen's syndrome by proxy. According to the NHS website, FII is a rare form of child abuse where a parent or carer exaggerates or deliberately causes symptoms of illness in the child. Mrs Cooper said that in January 2017, she and her husband Craig were worried that Baillie, who has cerebral palsy, was continually catching infections in hospital. They had concerns about the hospital which they believed were a factor in their daughter being unwell. They made a formal complaint to the hospital. She said: ""In February, Baillie's feeding tube leaked in hospital and they accused me of deliberately cutting her tube so she couldn't be fed. ""That night, social work appeared at Baillie's room and removed us from the hospital saying we were not allowed to be with her any more. And that went on for two years."" Baillie's mum could only spend a few hours of supervised time with her daughter on the day she started school Baillie was discharged from hospital in May 2017 and was to stay at her aunt and grandmother's home. She was not allowed to return to the family home where her two older sisters remained and her parents were only allowed supervised contact. In July Ms Cooper was questioned by police. She said: ""I was arrested and charged with the attempted murder of Baillie. I was put in a cell overnight then taken to court."" Several months later, criminal charges were dropped and no further action taken. During the course of the investigation, Mrs Cooper was only allowed to see her daughter in supervised visits of two hours at a time, which was increased over several months to 10 hours. It is the missed time with her young daughter that she says has made her go ahead with the civil case. Kirsteen Cooper was accused of trying to kill her daughter Baillie but charges were dropped Lawyers for the Cooper family are expected to serve a writ on NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde this week,reported the Daily Record,externalon Monday. Mrs Cooper said: ""What we have all been put through as a family is unbelievable. ""The reason I want to pursue it is because the time and the memories we lost with Baillie we can never get back. Special times like starting school that we were not allowed to be on our own with her. ""We want to ensure this never happens to another innocent family. We want things to be put in place that before children can be removed from their parents, there must be some kind of solid evidence of why it is happening so children don't have to go through this trauma. ""We watched Baillie go through trauma every night in hospital for months - hysterical crying being taken away from us."" Baillie was admitted to RCH in December 2016. Baillie is now seven years old and enjoying good health RCH is part of the Â£842m Queen Elizabeth University Hospital (QEUH) campus in Glasgow, which is the focus of a public inquiry over safety fears and patient deaths from infections.

An NHSGG spokeswoman said: ""We are unaware of any legal proceedings. The board does not comment on individual legal cases."" The family is now rebuilding their lives. Mrs Cooper fears she will never fully recover from the ordeal and says she is still trying to come to terms with what happened.

"Sir Keir Starmer is currently the party's shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer is the first Labour leadership candidate to pass the final hurdle to get onto the ballot. The Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied Workers (Usdaw) says it is backing the shadow Brexit secretary. This gives Sir Keir the support required - that of three unions and affiliate groups representing 5% of the membership - to get to the final stage. Usdaw has also given its support to shadow education secretary Angela Rayner for deputy leader. The union's general secretary, Paddy Lillis, said: ""The Labour Party must be led by someone who can persuade voters that they have what it takes to be a prime minister and we are a government-in-waiting."" Four other candidates are still in the running to succeed Jeremy Corbyn as leader - shadow business secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey, shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry, Wigan MP Lisa Nandy and Birmingham Yardley MP Jess Phillips. This video can not be played Four candidates remain in the race for the Labour leadership But they have yet to receive the backing of the necessary groups, or the alternative - the backing of 5% of constituency Labour parties (CLPs) - to make the final ballot. Who will be Labour's next leader? Splits held Labour back - leadership candidates Which Labour contender is the most working-class? Sir Keir, who also has the support of Unison and affiliate group Sera, said he was ""honoured"" to have the backing of Usdaw. He added: ""If I'm elected leader, Labour will stand shoulder to shoulder with the trade union movement as we take on the Tories and rebuild trust with working people."" Ms Rayner also thanked the union for its backing, saying: ""It's a great honour to be nominated by such a campaigning trade union."" This video can not be played Who decides on the next Labour leader? She faces competition for the deputy leadership from Scotland's only remaining Labour MP, Ian Murray, shadow equalities minister Dawn Butler, Tooting MP Rosena Allin-Khan and shadow justice secretary Richard Burgon. The unions, affiliate groups and CLPs have until 14 February to get their preferences submitted. The GMB union is expected to announce which candidate it will support on Tuesday after a hustings and meeting. Earlier on Monday, the deadline passed for new members to join the party - or an affiliated group - in time to vote in the leadership election. The final ballot of party members, trade unionists and registered supporters will open on 21 February, and the new leader and deputy will be announced on 4 April.

"One of Britain's oldest department stores has collapsed into administration, putting more than 1,000 jobs at risk. Beales has appointed KPMG as administrators after failing to find a buyer or new investment for the business. The department store began trading in Bournemouth in 1881 and has 23 shops. There will be no immediate closures and Beales stores will continue to trade, although the website is offline. Beales had tried to secure rent reductions with landlords and was in negotiations with potential investors and buyers. But KPMG said: ""Despite interest from a number of parties, this process did not secure any solvent solutions for the company, and as a result, the directors took the difficult decision to place the companies into administration."" In the year to March 2019, Beale Ltd reported a loss of Â£3.1m, up from Â£1.3m for the year earlier as costs swelled and sales dipped. KPMG's Will Wright, who is the joint administrator to Beales, said: ""With the impact of high rents and rates exacerbated by disappointing trading over the Christmas period, and extensive discussions around additional investment proving unsuccessful, there were no other available options but to place the company into administration. ""Over the coming weeks, we will endeavour to continue to operate all stores as a going concern while we assess options for the business, including dealing with prospective interested parties."" He said added that during this period gift vouchers, customer deposits and customer returns/refunds will continue to be honoured. Clintons strikes deal to avoid Christmas collapse Shopping centre owner seeks emergency cash 'We're devastated, Mothercare was our family' How to save the UK's crisis-hit High Streets Independent retail analyst Richard Hyman said it was ""no surprise"" that Beales had collapsed. ""It has been fighting for survival for quite some time, as have many other department stores,"" he said. Mr Hyman said department stores were ""very expensive to run"" and faced ""overwhelming"" competition from other stores, particularly online rivals, predicting there would be ""far fewer of them"" in future. ""It is getting much, much harder to operate a department store profitably,"" he said. Beales' chief executive Tony Brown led a management buyout of the firm in 2018. Beales has stores in the following towns and cities: Beccles Bedford Bournemouth Chipping Norton Diss Fareham Great Yarmouth Hexham Keighley Kendal Lowestoft Mansfield Perth Peterborough Poole Skegness Southport Spalding St Neots Tonbridge Wisbech Worthing Yeovil The company's decision to appoint administrators comes at a difficult time for UK retailers. Recent data from the British Retail Consortium revealed that retail salesfell for the first time in a quarter of a century last year. John Lewis has warned that its staff bonus may be in doubt as it reported Christmas sales at its department stores were down 2% for stores open at least a year. Shopping centre owner seeks emergency cash Some companies are prospering, however. Sports fashion retailer JD Sports says it expects to report full-year profits at the top end of forecasts. Next lifted its profit forecast after better than expected sales over Christmas trading period.

"This video can not be played HS2: How much work has already been done? The transport secretary has asked for more data before making a ""massive decision"" on HS2 as it emerged the new high-speed rail link could cost Â£106bn. A leaked report suggested the project could cost almost double from the Â£56bn expected in 2015. Grant Shapps said he has demanded more information about the scheme as the government prepares to decide whether to go ahead with the project. Downing Street refused to comment on the contents of the leaked report. Mr Shapps told Sky News that the ""massive decision"" on whether to go ahead with HS2 ""needs to be fact-based"". He said he had told the report's author, Doug Oakervee: ""Give me the facts, give me the data, give us the information so we can make a proper informed decision."" The unpublished report, which wasleaked to the Financial Times,external, said there was ""considerable risk"" that estimated costs could rise by another 20%. ""I've always approached this from a relatively neutral point of view and that information will help to inform a decision that is best for the whole country,"" Mr Shapps said. ""We'll be making a final decision, along with the prime minister and the chancellor, on this very shortly,"" he added. This video can not be played What does a billion pounds look like... and what can it buy? The governmentpreviously promised to make a decisionbefore the end of 2019. Along with a warning on costs, the report also made a number of suggestions. Among those was a recommendation to pause the second phase of the project while experts look at whether conventional lines could help link Birmingham to Manchester and Leeds instead. But the Mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, told the BBC's Today programme it would ""not be acceptable"" if the North of England portion of HS2 was delayed or downgraded to slower speeds. ""To me that would be the same old story. London to Birmingham, money is no object, and then all the penny pinching is done in the North of England,"" he said. Will HS2 ever get built? HS2 'threatens' natural habitats, report warns Mr Burnham said the development of an east-west rail route across the North - known as HS3 or Northern Powerhouse Rail - relied on HS2 being built. However, Lord Berkeley, a vocal critic of HS2 who was deputy chairman of the review before withdrawing his backing, said: ""I suspect that most of the people who like to use the trains around Manchester and Leeds would rather have a really good commuter service just like there is in London, rather than get to London half an hour quicker."" Some Â£8bn has already been spent on the project, which will connect London, the Midlands and northern England using trains capable of travelling at 250mph. West Midlands' mayor Andy Street said he still expected the project to go ahead. ""It will drive the regeneration of our economies in Birmingham, in Manchester, in Leeds and other cities in the Midlands and the North,"" he told the BBC. ""No government committed to levelling up around the country would possibly turn its back on that opportunity.""  Â£55.6bnExisting budget Â£32.7bnOriginal budget Â£7.4bnAlready spent on the project 9,000Jobs supported by the railway 345 milesNew high-speed track 50 minutesJourney time saving between London and Manchester In a letter to Prime Minister Boris Johnson some of the UK's largest construction firms warned that cancelling the project would do ""irreparable damage"" to the industry, costing thousands of jobs,the Times newspaper reported,external. Balfour Beatty, Skanska, Morgan Sindall, Costain, Mace and Sir Robert McAlpine are among firms arguing that a dearth of other big projects mean skills could be lost. Claire Walker, co-executive director of policy at the British Chambers of Commerce, told the BBC that the project must go ahead. ""Business communities are united that this project should be delivered and should be delivered in full,"" she said. ""There is no project that has been proposed that will go so far in delivering the transformational change to the Northern business communities as this project will."" A proposed design for an HS2 train The first phase of project, between London and Birmingham, is due to open at the end of 2026, with the second phase to Leeds and Manchester expected to be completed by 2032-33. Despite concerns about the rail link, Europe's largest infrastructure project, work is not on hold and the project currently gets through about Â£250m a month. ""The North's civic and business leaders have argued tirelessly that major infrastructure investment is so badly needed to provide the capacity so urgently needed on our rail network,"" said Northern Powerhouse Partnership Director, Henri Murison. Trains on the London to Birmingham route would be 400m-long (1,300ft) with up to 1,100 seats. They would run as many as 14 times per hour in each direction. The Department for Transport says the project will cut journey times between the cities from one hour 21 minutes to 52 minutes. Once the second phase is complete, Manchester to London journeys would take one hour seven minutes (down from two hours seven minutes), and Birmingham to Leeds would take 49 minutes (down from two hours). This would effectively reduce journey times between London and Edinburgh and London and Glasgow by an hour, to three-and-a-half hours. The government hopes its creation will free up capacity on overcrowded commuter routes. If you've followed the HS2 drama, then an estimate of Â£106bn for the entire project isn't surprising. But the fact that it's in yet another leaked draft of the government's review makes it part of the official narrative. Those opposed to HS2 feel a perfect storm is brewing. Conservative MPs (including ones newly elected in constituencies in the north of England) are pressing the PM to reconsider; the government's spending watchdog will soon publish a critical report; and Boris Johnson's transport advisor, Andrew Gilligan, is sceptical about the scheme. Tinkering with the project (reducing the speed of the trains or adding a station in between Birmingham and London) won't save much money and would slow the line down, defeating the point of it being super-high speed. So, in broad terms, it feels like the government has an all-or-nothing decision to make. HS2 currently burns about Â£250m a month, so you'd think the government would be in a hurry to make up its mind. But the fact we're told this 'isn't a final draft' of the review (even though we were previously told that the review should have been done at the end of last year) suggests government insiders are keeping their options open. A decision will probably come, I'm told, after Brexit. HS2 has always been split into fairly distinct parts (Phases 1, 2a and 2b) so putting the second phases on hold for a bit longer while further options are explored wouldn't in itself be a radical option. But the project has a lot of support from political and business leaders in the north of England and the Midlands, so if the government was then to scale back that second stretch of the railway it would cause a bit of a storm. HS2 should happen despite rising cost, review says HS2 costs out of control, says review deputy chair HS2 'threatens' natural habitats, report warns What is HS2 and why scrap the Manchester link?

The couple have since launched various commercial ventures, including a new lifestyle brand headed by Meghan Markle called American Riviera Orchard. Harry and Meghan met in 2016 and married in 2018. Theystepped down as senior royals in January 2020. Angry about media intrusion, they were frustrated that Buckingham Palace stopped them developing their ""SussexRoyal"" brand. Harry remains a prince andis fifth in line to the throne. Harry and Meghan were married in St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle The couple kept their Duke and Duchess of Sussex titles, but are no longer addressed as his or her royal highness (HRH). Harry also gave up his military titles. When Harry's father Charles became King, the couple's two children became Prince Archie and Princess Lilibet of Sussex.

Frogmore Cottage had been a gift from the late Queen Elizabeth In April 2024, documents filed to Companies House listed the US as the country where Harry is usually resident, instead of the UK. The change was dated 29 June 2023, thought to be the date the couple formally left Frogmore Cottage. The conservative US think tank The Heritage Foundationhas repeatedly raised questions about Harry's US immigration statusbecause of his previous comments about taking cocaine, marijuana and psychedelic mushrooms. It wants the government to release his records, to show whether drug use was disclosed - as this can block US visa applications. But in September,US judge Carl Nichols ruled Prince Harry's visa application should remain private. Separately, some reports had suggested the prince - who turned 40 on 15 September - was seeking a phased return to the UK. However, BBC News royal correspondent Sean Coughlan said ""well placed sources""had confirmed Prince Harry would continue to be based in the US,partly because of continuing concerns about his family's security arrangements.

In April 2024, Archewell saidtwo new series were in production,,externalone celebrating ""the joys of cooking & gardening, entertaining, and friendship"", and another exploring the world of professional polo. In September, Netflixannounced on X, formerly Twitter,external, that Polo would be broadcast in December. The couple previously featured in the Harry and Meghan documentary series, where they talked about life in the Royal Family, and The Heart of Invictus series, which discussed the duke's emotional ""unravelling"" after military service in Afghanistan. The Netflix documentaries have featured previously unseen photographs of the couple Archewell alsomade podcasts for Spotifyunder a contract thought to be worth $25m (Â£19.7m). The arrangement ended in June 2023. In February 2024,Meghan announced a new podcast deal with Lemonada Media.,external Books Harry's memoir, Spare, was published in January 2023. It discussed his relationship with his brother and father, as well as his griefover the death of his mother, Princess Diana. The Prince's much-publicised memoir sold 467,183 copies in its first week The book's publishers promised $1.5m (Â£1.18m) and Â£300,000 would be given to the Sentebale and WellChild charities. Meghan wrote a children's book called The Bench in 2021. Inheritance William and Harry received the bulk of Princess Diana's Â£13m fortune when she died in 1997. In a 2021 interview, Harry told Oprah Winfreythis money funded his family's move to the US. He is also thought to have inherited millions from his great-grandmother, the Queen Mother. It is not known whether the late Queen left him any money. Acting During her acting career, the Duchess of Sussex was reportedly paid $50,000 (Â£40,000) for each episode of the legal drama Suits. She appeared in more than 100 episodes. Meghan Markle pictured with her Suits co-stars in 2012 After stepping back from official duties, the duke and duchess were no longer afforded the security arrangements provided for senior royals. When Harry first left the UK, he said it would be too dangerous to bring his family back without adequate police protection, and took the government to court. Home Office lawyers said the duke would still have publicly funded police security in the UK, under ""bespoke arrangements"". In late February 2024,the High Court ruled that this approach ""was, and is, legally sound"". In June, Harry's legal team saidhe had been given permission to challenge the High Court decision in the Court of Appeal. An earlier separate court rulingrejected the prince's request to be allowed to pay privately for more substantial protection. Harrysettled a phone-hacking claim against Mirror Group Newspapers in February 2024. His lawyer said the duke had been awarded ""substantial"" damages. He was also grantedÂ£140,600 in damages in another part of the case. A number of other court cases are continuing, including: claims from the duke and othersthat the Daily Mail-publisher Associated Newspapers unlawfully obtained information about him claims thatThe Sun's publisher News Group Newspapers (NGN) used illegal methods to gather information on the couple In June 2024,a High Court judge ordered Harry to explainwhy messages which might be relevant to his legal case against the publisher of the Sun have been deleted.

"Tony Hall outside the BBC's London HQ Tony Hall is to step down as director general of the BBC in the summer, after seven years in the role. Lord Hall said the decision had been hard, adding: ""If I followed my heart I would genuinely never want to leave."" But he said he felt it was important the BBC had the same leader for the BBC's mid-term review in 2022 and the renewal of its charter in 2027. The National Gallerysubsequently announced,externalhe had been appointed chair of its board of trustees. The BBC's chairman, Sir David Clementi, said the search for the BBC's next leader would begin ""within the next few weeks"". He added that the BBC was ""committed to selecting the best-qualified person for the job"". BBC Newsnight understands Lord Hall had wanted to stay until the BBC's centenary in 2022, but after ""big discussions with the board"" it was decided he would go earlier. The programme's political editor Nicholas Watt said the timing was being interpreted in government circles as ""something of a masterstroke"" by Sir David, whose term as chairman ends in 2021. ""Had Tony Hall waited until 2022 it would have been a new chairman of the BBC making the appointment, and that new chairman would have been appointed by Boris Johnson's government,"" said the correspondent. James Purnell, the former Labour politicianwho became the BBC's director of radio and education in 2016, is currently the bookmakers' favourite to take on the role. Fran Unsworth,the BBC's director of news and current affairs, is another contender, as is Anne Bulford,the BBC's first female deputy director general, who left the corporation last year. Media commentators are also speculating, withThe Independent's Adam Sherwin,externalsuggesting Channel 4's chief executive Alex Mahon might be in the frame, along with Apple's Jay Hunt and Charlotte Moore, the BBC's director of content. The Guardian also points to these female candidates,externalbut also suggests former Ofcom chief Sharon White and Gail Rebuck, chair of Penguin Random House UK, might be in contention. Newsnight's Nicholas Watt said he was hearing that the cabinet ""are expecting the BBC to sound them out on this appointment"", and there was ""no appetite"" in the government for ""a BBC lifer"" who is not interested in reform. Speaking of Lord Hall, Sir David said the corporation had been ""lucky to have him"". He described him as ""an inspirational creative leader"" who had ""led the BBC with integrity and a passion for our values"". Samira Ahmed recently won an employment tribunal she brought against the BBC Culture secretary Nicky Morgan thanked Lord Hall for his service, saying he had made ""a huge contribution to public service broadcasting in his career"". ""In this ever changing broadcast landscape the next DG will need to build on Lord Hall's success,""she wrote on Twitter,external. In a letter to staff, Lord Hall said he believed he would be ""leaving the BBC in a much stronger place than when I joined"". His appointment in 2012 followed the resignation of George Entwistle in the wake of theNewsnight Lord McAlpine row. Lord Hall said the BBC felt ""a very different organisation"" that was ""more innovative, more open, more inclusive, more efficient [and] more commercially aware"". The director general, or DG, is the chief executive officer of the BBC, its editor-in-chief. The person in the post is the editorial, operational and creative leader of the corporation, with responsibility for a worldwide workforce running services across television, radio and online. The DG and the BBC board are responsible for the effective running of the BBC, delivering its public service and commercial services - including BBC Studios  - both at home and abroad. The DG is appointed by the BBC board. As of April 2019, the holder of the post is paid Â£450,000 a year. ""Change has been tough at times,"" he wrote. ""But I believe our recent record of transformation stands comparison with virtually any other creative organisation in the world."" Lord Hall takes over at the National Gallery in London from interim chair Sir John Kingman, who has been in the post since Hannah Rothschild's departure in September 2019. He said: ""I am proud to take on the role of its chair. The National Gallery isn't just about serving those who already love art, but reaching a wider audience and future generations."" His appointment was welcomed by Baroness Morgan, who said he would bring ""a wealth of experience"" to the role. This video can not be played BBC media editor Amol Rajan says Lord Hall's successor will need ""phenomenal skills"" Director general of the BBC is one of the most privileged, but also one of the most relentless and tough jobs in Britain - and it gets tougher every day, because of the technological context. His successor will need to combine world-class political, commercial, editorial and managerial talent, while coming under a relentless barrage of criticism from all fronts. The question of who gets it will depend on where the BBC Board and its chairman, Sir David Clementi, want to place their emphasis. Someone with commercial nous, or someone who can charm Boris Johnson and Dominic Cummings? Someone with a track record at managing talent - or someone who can make a brave, correct call on a Panorama investigation? The perfect candidate will be able to do all this - and therefore doesn't exist. Read more from Amol here Lord Hall's departure from the BBC comes amid another turbulent time for the broadcaster, with issues around equal pay disputes, political bias, diversity and TV licences at the top of its agenda. June Sarpong said she relished ""the challenge... to make the BBC more inclusive."" Earlier this month presenter Samira Ahmed won an employment tribunal in a dispute over equal pay, while radio presenter Sarah Montague has confirmed she won a settlement and an apology from the BBC after being treated ""unequally"". Samira Ahmed wins BBC equal pay tribunal Montague confirms Â£400k BBC equal pay settlement The BBC has also faced criticism over its reporting on therecent general election,presenter pay,star salariesand alack of diversityboth on and off screen. It also found itself in the spotlight back in 2018 whenSir Cliff Richard won a High Court case against the broadcasterover its coverage of a police raid on his home. Last year TV presenter and campaigner June Sarpong was appointed the BBC's first director of creative diversity in a bid to improve the BBC's ""on-air talent portrayal"". June Sarpong appointed BBC diversity director Sarpong said it had been a ""great pleasure and honour"" to work under Lord Hall's ""visionary leadership"". ""I cannot overstate the support he has shown me in helping to start the process of inclusive change,""she wrote on Twitter,external. ""He will be sincerely missed."" Other developments during Lord Hall's tenure include the growth of BBC iPlayer, the increasingsuccess of BBC Studios.and the launches of BBC Sounds and streaming service Britbox. It was also announced last yearthat free TV licences for all over 75s would be scrapped and replaced by a scheme based on pension credit benefit. Lord Hall is the BBC's 16th director general Last weekLord Hall outlined a planthat will see at least two thirds of the corporation's staff based outside London by 2027. Lord Hall, 68, joined the corporation as a trainee in the Belfast newsroom in 1973. He became editor of the Nine O'Clock News at the age of 34 and was appointed chief executive of BBC News in 1996. While there, he launched BBC Radio 5 Live, the news channel, the BBC News website and the parliament channel. He left in 2001 to become the chief executive of the the Royal Opera House until 2013, and was also deputy chairman of Channel 4. He was also on the board of the London organising committee for the Olympic Games before returning to the BBC in the top job. Lord Hall, whose official title is The Lord Hall of Birkenhead, was made a cross-bench peer in 2010. Bonnie Greer, who served alongside Lord Hall on the Royal Opera House board, noted that the BBC had been going through a difficult period. ""I think it's been a lot of pressure for the organisation and a lot of pressure for him,"" the playwright and critic said on The Victoria Derbyshire Show. Lord Hall with Alice Webb, director of BBC Children's, and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge in November 2018 Talent agent Jonathan Shalit said Lord Hall had been ""fantastic"" in the director general role and that it was ""normal"" for someone in his position to move on after seven years. ""He was going to be moving on soon,"" he told the same BBC programme. ""I think the point he makes about making sure one person oversees the midway point of the licence fee is important."" Philippa Childs, head of broadcast trade union Bectu, said Lord Hall had been ""a strong advocate for the BBC, its staff [and] the licence fee"". She said the outgoing director general had always ""acted with integrity and transparency"" during their ""extremely positive and productive working relationship"". Veteran presenter David Dimbleby said Lord Hall ""revived the place"" because of his passion for broadcasting. On the future of the BBC, Dimbleby added: ""It's always worth remembering, I think in the end, people trust the BBC more than the politicians who try to diminish it. ""I'm not saying there aren't major, major problems with the BBC at the moment; I think there are."" Former BBC chairman Michael Grade said he did not believe that Sir David, or the BBC board, would allow the government to interfere with the appointment of the director general.

"The project is set to be the world's largest polyhalite mine Thousands of people who invested in a Â£4bn mining project may be left out of pocket as a result of a takeover bid. Up to 85,000 small investors sank cash into the Sirius Mineral development near Whitby before it ran into financial difficulty last year. Mining giant Anglo American has offered to buy the project for Â£405m, with investors set to receive 5.5p a share. The company said it was ""sensitive to the fact that the price is lower than what many people may have invested"". About 10,000 of the investorslive near the mine, which would extract polyhalite from beneath North York Moors National Park before transporting it on an underground conveyor belt to a processing plant near the former Redcar steelworks. Sirius failed to reach a fundraising target which would have unlocked a $2.5bn bank loan Scott Murphy, a ""seasoned investor"" from London, looks set to lose about Â£12,000, but said his thoughts were with investors in the local area. ""A lot of them have no real investment experience,"" he said. ""They're 'Ordinary Joes' who have been sold the dream and that's what I find disgusting. ""I've got no excuse for losing my money and I accept it for what it is, but many of these people are not going to get an opportunity to get their money back."" by Danny Savage, BBC North of England correspondent The project plans to extract polyhalite from a mile below the North York Moors The takeover of the Sirius Minerals project may secure jobs but there will be dismay and anger behind the front doors of plenty of houses in North Yorkshire and Teesside. This scheme attracted a large number of small investors, individuals who saw an opportunity to buy into a local project. It was the talk of the area, a huge project to mine a valuable resource. There was gold - well, polyhalite actually - in them there hills. I remember going to a prospective investors meeting at Ravenscar several years ago where there were dozens of people in their forties, fifties and sixties, thinking of buying in to help their retirement. It got under way and soon seemed too big to fail, but not, it seems, too big to be taken over. Now, anyone who bought shares for more than 5.5p each will be taking a hit. The other side of the coin is the old argument that shares can go down as well as up and perhaps you should not invest what you can't afford to lose. But many investors had an altruistic take on getting involved; it was local, some of them can literally see the project from their homes. That view could now be a painful outlook instead of a pleasant one. Shares in Sirius Minerals hit a high of about 45p in August 2016 and were worth more than 22p a year ago. But share prices dropped when Sirius Minerals slowed construction work at the end of 2019due to funding problems. Sirius chairman Russell Scrimshaw said the company had searched for a partner who would provide cash in return for a minority stake, but in the end the full acquisition by Anglo American was the only ""viable proposal"". The deal is subject to shareholder approval but the firm, which has its head office in Scarborough, will recommend they accept Anglo American's offer. Mr Scrimshaw said that if the offer was not approved then there was a high probability Sirius could be placed into administration or liquidation within weeks. Mark Cutifani, the chief executive of Anglo American, said the company will look at opportunities to improve the project but stressed ""this process is about preserving and creating jobs, not cutting them"".

"The UK's post-Brexit immigration system will put ""people before passports"", Boris Johnson has said. Speaking at the UK-Africa Investment Summit, the PM said immigration would become ""fairer... treating people the same wherever they come from"". Freedom of movement between the UK and EU is expected to end after the Brexit transition period on 31 December 2020. The government says it willintroduce an Australian-style points based systemby January 2021. Under this system those wanting to work in the UK could be assigned points based on a number of professional and personal characteristics such as education levels. Currently, under freedom of movement, EU citizens do not need a visa to work in the UK, but immigrants from outside the EU are subject to a points system based on English language skills, being sponsored by a company and meeting a salary threshold. BBC Briefing: Your guide to immigration What Brexit could mean for Africa Five times immigration changed the UK Speaking in London, the prime minister said post-Brexit the UK's immigration system would become ""more equal"". ""By putting people before passports we will be able to attract the best talent from around the world, wherever they may be,"" he said. All the main parties are largely behind the idea of a skills-based system. The question here is whether or not the government wants to come up with some kind of control - to put a cap over the top of it. We don't know yet what the government's real position is - it's only got 11 months to find out. In the coming weeks, the government's main advisory body is going to report back on some of these questions. It is only then we'll have some answers about what the PM's direction of travel is. Speaking at the summit, Mr Johnson sought to encourage investment in the UK describing the country as a ""one-stop shop for the ambitious growing international economy"". He also promised the UK would no longer provide ""any new direct official development assistance, investment, export credit or trade promotion for thermal coal mining or coal power plants overseas"". ""Not another penny of UK taxpayers' money will be directly invested in digging up coal or burning it for electricity,"" he said. ""There's no point in the UK reducing the amount of coal we burn if we then trundle over to Africa and line our pockets by encouraging African states to use more of it,"" he said. ""Instead we are going to focus on supporting the transition to lower and zero carbon alternatives."" According to the Department for International Development, the UK has not provided bilateral official development assistance for coal-fire power generation and coal mining since 2012. It says that in the future direct support for thermal coal mining and coal-fired power plants from the Department for International Trade will be stopped and refocused on other activity. Commenting on the government's UK-Africa Investment Summit, shadow international development minister Preet Kaur Gill said: ""The Conservatives will continue to misuse the country's aid budget to prop up the needs of business elites rather than spend it on tackling global poverty, inequality and the climate crisis. ""Trade and investment deals are not a panacea for ending poverty, especially when they're written in line with the demands of big business, and don't have safeguards in place to protect public services or ensure the most marginalised groups aren't left behind.""

"A forensic examination of the scene is under way, police said Three men have died in a stabbing in east London. Police said they were called at about 19:40 GMT on Sunday to reports of a disturbance in Elmstead Road in Seven Kings, Ilford. Three men, aged in their 20s or 30s, who were involved in a fight, were found by emergency services with stab injuries, the Metropolitan Police said. All three were pronounced dead at the scene. Two men, aged 29 and 39, have been arrested on suspicion of murder. Ch Supt Steve Clayman said a fight had broken out between two groups who were armed with knives, leaving three men fatally stabbed. ""We can now say that two arrests have since been made, so there has been progress. ""The parties are believed to be known to each other and the group are within the Sikh community,"" he added. Sabih Qureshi, who lives in the area, told the BBC he had seen seven or eight men ""fighting each other"" in the same place on Saturday, which he believed was ""linked for sure"". He said: ""They were saying 'I will kill you', and the person was saying 'ok kill me'. For sure it was linked."" After seeing the three ""badly injured"" men following the attack, Mr Qureshi said he and several others tried to help and give them CPR. The Ilford resident added that one of the men was already dead, while the other two were ""not conscious"" but breathing ""just a little"". ""It was very violent. All the blood was in the street,"" he said. Police investigations are continuing Louis O'Donoghoe described seeing ""absolute chaos"" after he had heard screaming and shouting outside his house. It was like something out of a movie, horrific,"" the 40-year-old scaffolder said. Formal identification of the victims is yet to take place. The stabbings bring the number of homicide investigations launched by the Met in 2020 to six. Police will continue to patrol the area on Monday Greg Mckenzie, BBC London There has been a visible police presence here since Sunday night. Officers were called just before 20:00 to reports of a disturbance but when they arrived, they found three young men - all in close proximity to each other - with fatal stab wounds. At the end of one of the police cordons put in place you can just about make out the tops of the forensic tents - three dotted next to each other  - which marks the exact spots where these individuals were pronounced dead. An enhanced police presence was seen in the Redbridge area on Monday Despite the works of the emergency services, these men could not be saved. I've seen graphic video from a nearby resident that was filmed shortly after the incident showing pools of blood on the street. I've been speaking to some residents here this morning who say they have raised concerns to police over gangs congregating behind Seven King's train station, where they often drink and smoke cannabis. Road closures and an enhanced police presence will be seen in the Redbridge area. Mayor of London Sadiq Khan tweeted: ""My thoughts are with their families and the local community at this dreadful time."" He said extra police enforcement powers had been authorised for the whole of Redbridge borough until 08:00 on Monday. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Madonna's Madame X tour is due to come to the UK next month Madonna has cancelled another show on her Madame X world tour, as she battles an ongoing, but unspecified, injury. The star gave fans in Lisbon just 45 minutes' notice that her show on Sunday night was being called off. ""We regret to inform you that Madonna is unable to perform this evening,"" an email informed ticketholders at 19:45. She had been due on stage at 20:30. ""Sorry I had to cancel tonight,""the star wrote on Instagram,external, ""but I must listen to my body and rest!"" It is the eighth time Madonna has had to cancel a show on her current world tour, which sees her playing smaller, intimate theatre venues. She has not revealed the nature her injury, but told one audience in San Francisco she was suffering from a ""torn ligament"" and ""a bad knee"" in November. In a video posted to social media last week, she was shown wearing knee supports while rehearsing for an earlier show in Lisbon. ""How an injured Madame X warms up for a show,"" she wrote in the caption. ""Very carefully."" The star has also shared videos of her taking post-show ice baths to help her cope with ""multiple injuries"" that are causing ""overwhelming pain"". Allow Instagram content?

Madonna began the current stage of her Madame X tour in Portugal's Coliseu Dis Recreios theatre on 12 January, and had seemed to be in good spirits, interacting with the crowd and drinking port on stage. The star said it was her first drink ""in a month"" and that it had ""got her through"" the strenuous show. She also joked about her ""25 injuries"" and told the audience ""don't pay attention to what goes on from the waist down"",reported Lisbon-based music magazine Blitz,external. The star also traded high heels for flat shoes during last Thursday's concert. ""They are very ugly but it was either wear these boots or cancel the show,""the star was quoted as saying by the Portuguese website Sapo,external. Madonna said she hoped the tour would resume this week, writing on Instagram: ""See you on Tuesday, fingers crossed."" The show is due to come to the UK on 27 January, with 15 dates planned at the London Palladium. Anger and recrimination might well have been expected among the Madonna fans who crowded outside the historic Coliseu Dos Recreios in the heart of Lisbon to hear the news they dreaded. Many had flown in from around the world to see their ""queen"" grace the intimate venue, just a few miles from her new Portuguese home. But as they took photos of the cancellation notices posted on the door, less than an hour before the official start time, there was plenty of understanding and concern for the injured star. After all, fans are fully aware that this is an all-out performer, battling against injury, who offers no compromise on stage. Madonna started out as a dancer and, even at 61, this is a show where her on-stage movement is as much a part of the act as her singing. One fan who summed up his own frustration by posting a single-finger message to Madonna was quickly joined online by others speculating that she may need to postpone the rest of her tour, including 15 dates at the London Palladium next month. But as a Coliseu staff member, standing at the door that remained resolutely shut, told me: ""She did a great show here last night so you and the other fans here tonight are really unlucky.""

"The Duke and Duchess of Sussex will not return as working members of the Royal Family, Buckingham Palace has said. The couple said last year that they would step back as ""senior"" royals, and work to become financially independent. In 2016, Kensington Palace released a statement confirming Harry had been dating US actress Meghan Markle ""for a few months"". They were pictured in public for the first time in Toronto, attending a wheelchair tennis match during the 2017 Invictus Games. They announced their engagement a few weeks after being first pictured together. Meghan told BBC News that Harry's proposal was ""just an amazing surprise, it was so sweet and natural and very romantic"". In February 2018, the couple took part in their first joint engagement with Prince Harry's brother and sister-in-law, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. As Meghan joined their Royal Foundation charity, Harry joked the foursome were now ""stuck together"". The couple were married at Windsor Castle, on 19 May 2018, with 1,200 public invitations to the grounds of the castle. They travelled through the town in a horse-drawn carriage. Up to 100,000 well-wishers lined the route as the duke and duchess travelled through Windsor. The couple exchanged vows and rings before the Queen and 600 guests at St George's Chapel. The couple kissed on the steps of St George's Chapel. The Queen, Duke of Edinburgh and other members of the Royal Family attended the wedding. The newlyweds held hands after the ceremony. In June 2018, the Queen and the duchess were seen at their first royal engagement together, as they officially opened the Mersey Gateway Bridge and Chester's Storyhouse Theatre. That autumn, Kensington Palace revealed the duchess was pregnant and the couple's baby was due in the spring. Shortly after the announcement, they embarked on their first official overseas tour, visiting Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Tonga. On one of their engagements, the couple posed with OneWave, a surfing community group that raises awareness of mental health and wellbeing, at Bondi Beach, in Sydney, Australia On 6 May, 2019, Meghan gave birth to a boy, Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor, who became seventh in line to the throne. Harry told reporters: ""It's been the most amazing experience I could ever possibly imagine"". In June 2019, the couple announced they were splitting from the charity they shared with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, to set up their own foundation. Last autumn, Archie travelled with the couple to southern Africa on their first royal tour as a family, and was a big hit with Archbishop Desmond Tutu. An image of a beaming Prince Harry holding his son while on an extended stay in Canada was released by the couple as part of an Instagram compilation summing up their year. Following their trip, the couple were pictured in January on a visit to Canada House. In February, the couple announced that they are expecting their second child.

"The Duke and Duchess of Sussex left the UK after stepping back from official royal duties. The couple have since launched various commercial ventures, including a new lifestyle brand headed by Meghan Markle called American Riviera Orchard. Harry and Meghan met in 2016 and married in 2018. Theystepped down as senior royals in January 2020. Angry about media intrusion, they were frustrated that Buckingham Palace stopped them developing their ""SussexRoyal"" brand. Harry remains a prince andis fifth in line to the throne. Harry and Meghan were married in St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle The couple kept their Duke and Duchess of Sussex titles, but are no longer addressed as his or her royal highness (HRH).

Frogmore Cottage had been a gift from the late Queen Elizabeth In April 2024, documents filed to Companies House listed the US as the country where Harry is usually resident, instead of the UK. The change was dated 29 June 2023, thought to be the date the couple formally left Frogmore Cottage. The conservative US think tank The Heritage Foundationhas repeatedly raised questions about Harry's US immigration statusbecause of his previous comments about taking cocaine, marijuana and psychedelic mushrooms. It wants the government to release his records, to show whether drug use was disclosed - as this can block US visa applications. But in September,US judge Carl Nichols ruled Prince Harry's visa application should remain private. Separately, some reports had suggested the prince - who turned 40 on 15 September - was seeking a phased return to the UK. However, BBC News royal correspondent Sean Coughlan said ""well placed sources""had confirmed Prince Harry would continue to be based in the US,partly because of continuing concerns about his family's security arrangements.

"This video can not be played The BBC spoke to people in Beijing who seemed largely unconcerned about the virus The number of people infected with a new virus in China tripled over the weekend, with the outbreak spreading from Wuhan to other major cities. There are now more than 200 cases, mostly in Wuhan, though the respiratory illness has also been detected in Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen. Three people have died. Japan, Thailand and South Korea have reported cases. The new strain of coronavirus, which causes a type of pneumonia, can pass from person to person, China confirmed. Respiratory expert Zhong Nanshan, who heads the health commission team investigating the virus, said 14 medical workers had caught it while treating patients, state media reported. The sharp rise comes as millions of Chinese prepare to travel for the Lunar New Year holidays. Although the outbreak is believed to have originated from a market, officials and scientists are yet to determine exactly how it has been spreading. Mystery Chinese virus: How worried should we be? New Chinese virus 'preventable and controllable' The outbreak has revived memories of the Sars virus - also a coronavirus - that killed 774 people in the early 2000s across dozens of countries, mostly in Asia.  Analysis of the genetic code of the new virus shows it is more closely related to Sars than any other human coronavirus. Experts in the UK told the BBCthe number of people infected could still be far greaterthan official figures suggest, with estimates closer to 1,700. 2019-nCoV, as it's been labelled, is understood to be a new strain of coronavirus that has not previously been identified in humans Coronaviruses are a broad family of viruses, but only six (the new one would make it seven) are known to infect people Scientists believe an animal source is ""the most likely primary source"" but that some human-to-human transmission has occurred Signs of infection include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties People are being advised to avoid ""unprotected"" contact with live animals, thoroughly cook meat and eggs, and avoid close contact with anyone with cold or flu-like symptoms Source: World Health Organization Authorities in Wuhan, a central Chinese city of 11 million that has been at the heart of the outbreak, on Monday said 136 new cases had been confirmed over the weekend, with a third person dying of the virus. There had previously been only 62 confirmed cases in the city. As of late Sunday, officials said 170 people in Wuhan were still being treated in hospital, including nine in critical condition. Beijing also confirmed its first cases, with five people infected. Shanghai confirmed its first case on Monday - a 56-year-old woman who came from Wuhan. Airports including Narita in Tokyo have been screening passengers In the city of Shenzhen, a major tech hub close to Hong Kong, officials said a 66-year-old man showed symptoms of the virus following a trip to visit relatives in Wuhan. State media reported 14 other cases in Guangdong province. Four cases have been confirmed abroad - two in Thailand, one in Japan and one in South Korea - all of them involving people who are either from Wuhan or have visited the city. In South Korea, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said a 35-year-old Chinese woman was suffering from a fever and respiratory problems after travelling there from Wuhan. She was put into isolation and treated at a local hospital. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The World Health Organization said it was currently not recommending restrictions on travel or trade, but was providing guidance to countries preparing for any outbreak. Airports in Singapore, Hong Kong and the Japanese capital Tokyo have been screening air passengers from Wuhan, and US authorities last week announced similar measures at three major airports in San Francisco, Los Angeles and New York. How China is responding to the outbreak is under close scrutiny, given that it was widely criticised for initially covering up the Sars crisis in late 2002 and early 2003. On Monday, Chinese President Xi Jinping for the first time publicly addressed the outbreak, saying that the virus must be ""resolutely contained"". The foreign ministry, meanwhile, said China was providing ""timely information about the disease"" and would ""work with all parties to deal with the virus"". China's National Health Commission on Monday confirmed that two cases in China were due to human-to-human transmission, state-run Xinhua news agency reported. The commission had earlier said there had been no such cases, but that the virus had instead crossed the species barrier and come from infected animals at a seafood and wildlife market in Wuhan. Health officials have been analysing the seafood market where they believe the virus originated The WHO also said it believed there had been ""some limited human-to-human transmission occurring between close contacts"". ""As moreâ¦ cases are identified and more analysis undertaken, we will get a clearer picture of disease severity and transmission patterns,"" it wrote on Twitter. It noted that the rise in cases in China was a result of ""increased searching and testing for [the virus] among people sick with respiratory illness"". This video can not be played Coronavirus feared to have infected more than initially thought according to scientists From Friday, most Chinese will begin their week-long Lunar New Year holidays. It's a time when hundreds of millions travel around China to visit family, raising fears that authorities will not be able to adequately monitor further spread of the disease. Wuhan is a transport hub and authorities there have for nearly a week been using temperature scanners at airports, and train and bus stations. Those showing signs of fever have been registered, given masks and taken to hospitals and clinics. Chinese companies shut down for Lunar New Year, with hundreds of millions of people travelling Authorities say they will now also be screening everyone leaving the city. At Beijing's central railway station, some travellers donned masks but did not appear overly concerned about the virus. ""Watching the news, I do feel a little worried. But I haven't taken precautionary measures beyond wearing regular masks,"" Li Yang, a 28-year-old account manager travelling to the region of Inner Mongolia, told the AFP news agency. But the tone in Chinese social media, where the outbreak has been a top trending topic, was different. ""Who knows how many people who have been to Wuhan may be unaware that they have already been infected?"" one Weibo user said.

" How we made a life in Germany By Kevin Connolly  When you are a migrant, timing is everything. Sometimes that’s because you have to judge the moment when the time has come to leave your home, if you’re driven by war and disease or famine and poverty. Sometimes it’s because there are opportunities in the country to which you want to move - a labour shortage, perhaps, or a relaxation of visa rules. When we think about movements of population, we tend to mean from poorer countries to richer ones in search of a better life. Things are more complex if it’s between countries with roughly similar levels of prosperity. The British and the Germans, for example, have been settling in each other’s countries in small but significant numbers for many years. The precise numbers have always depended on the prevailing historical circumstances. Joint membership of the European Union since 1973 has made it easier to move for work, but the UK also left armies of occupation in Germany after both world wars. For nearly 200 years, Britain has had a royal family drawn from German nobility. All that shared history created plenty of shared roots as courtiers flitted between the two capitals, soldiers settled down with German wives, and workers took advantage of the EU’s freedom of movement to build new lives. History created the framework and every settler chose the time that was right for them.     Timing is important in the life of Ruth Barry, a young businesswoman who migrated from Scotland to Germany by way of England and France. Ruth is a baker and professional baking relies on meticulous control of time and temperature allied to precise measurement of ingredients and repetition of method. Ruth’s business is the Black Isle Bakery in the smart Mitte district of Berlin.    The calligraphy on the shop front is elegant - the decor inside spare and minimalist. The walls are white, punctuated with quotes evoking the Black Isle itself, Ruth’s Scottish home to the north of Inverness. But that elegance and minimalism is not the whole story. “It’s a really hard life and people don’t get to see that,” she says. “People think it must be nice that I get to do my hobby, but they don’t see me lugging 25kg sacks of flour around when I’ve been here since 05:45, and I haven’t sat down and I haven’t eaten lunch and I’ve also been serving people.” Her fierce work ethic and attention to detail clearly helps to provide the fuel of energy and determination you need to succeed in a new country.  But her decision to start a new life has come at a cost: “If I was in Berlin and I had a salary and I felt some kind of freedom, I think Berlin would be a wonderful place to be. I think you can have a quality of life here that was not available to me in London.” Most migrants, of course, look for jobs when they exchange one country for another. Only a small minority do what Ruth has done and create a business for themselves out of nothing.     Sources:ONS (April 2018) Living Abroad;Eurostat (April 2019) Foreign language skills    Baking can be hard work. Baking in a foreign country can be even harder. And baking in a country where commercial regulations and banking rules weren’t written to help the entrepreneur is probably the hardest work of all. Her experiences provide a checklist of the relative advantages of operating a start-up business in London and Berlin. The main difficulty in London is the price of property - not just renting a shop or working kitchen but paying for somewhere to live. Ruth’s sense is that property prices in Berlin are rising quickly - to the resentment of some locals watching an influx of migrants - but they’re still far below London levels, and so less of a drain on a start-up budget. But some of the barriers to business are more subtle. Ruth has found the German banking system to be expensive and cumbersome compared with the UK’s. On top of that, she says, there are challenging cultural attitudes to entrepreneurship. Germany, of course, is an economic powerhouse, a strong presence in the global export trade in cars, machine tools and all sorts of precision engineering. But that doesn’t necessarily trickle down, in Ruth’s experience, into a cultural sympathy for the businesswoman looking to get a new business off the ground.      In Berlin, she says, there’s no great history of small-scale, start-up capitalism. “There’s a very strong focus here on craft,” she says. “For two years, you go and learn how to be a baker and at the end of that you have your certificate that says ‘Bäckermeister’, so that doesn’t leave much space for entrepreneurialism.” And that feeds through into a kind of consumer conservatism too, Ruth reckons. Many Germans, it turns out, have very specific and very conventional expectations of what you should find in a bakery, and the purpose of opening new bakeries in their view is not to widen the repertoire of goods on offer, but to expand the number of places where you can buy the same narrow range of delicacies. As Ruth explains: “When they come in and they see that we don’t have the dark heavy rye bread, or the little bread rolls, or torten, I think they’re disappointed.” Ruth’s approach though is prospering. One magazine described her millionaire’s shortbread as being like “the best Twix on the planet”, and her strictly seasonal approach to ingredients is a little signal to customers that the focus is on quality rather than familiarity. We visited in autumn when the season of tomatoes was giving way to the season of pumpkins - a time for even the most conservative customer to try something new.     Source:UN DESA (2017) International Migration   Migrants of course have to learn lessons from their new home. For Ruth, that means thinking about producing “empire biscuits” - something that middle-aged Germans in particular consider to be a British delicacy but which the British themselves tend never to have heard of.   The second lesson is simple - sometimes you have to go where the market takes you. Ruth, for example, has discovered that German people love scones. “Honestly,” she says, “I am just going to have to start making them because I get asked about 17 times a week.”      Some of the data in this article is drawn fromBBC Briefing, a mini-series of downloadable in-depth guides to the big issues in the news, with input from academics, researchers and journalists. It is the BBC's response to audiences demanding better explanation of the facts behind the headlines.    Every wave of British migrants in Germany had lessons to learn of one sort or another - often at challenging moments in history. It is unlikely that Prince Ernest Augustus of Hanover would have considered himself part of a 19th Century wave of British migration into Germany. But as the fifth son of King George III, he does qualify - just about. Ernest Augustus became King of Hanover Ernest Augustus was born in England but returned to his family’s seat of power to take the throne in Hanover, because Hanoverian law in that period prevented the throne from passing to a female claimant. His statue is the first thing you see when you emerge from the bustling railway station in the city. He’s a reminder of how historical connections shape the modern world. Perhaps it was because of that royal link (the House of Hanover ruled the UK from 1714 to 1901), that this region of Germany was assigned to the British Military Government at the end of World War Two in 1945. The Hanoverians are a fascinating bunch. George I was only 52nd in line to the British throne when he took the crown in 1714. He was widely reputed - perhaps unfairly - to not even speak English. But he was the principal Protestant contender and British law was designed to ensure that the crown wouldn’t revert to a Roman Catholic. All that most people remember of the dynasty these days is the “madness of King George III” an incapacitating mental condition that saw one of his sons reign as Prince Regent. But there was much that was noteworthy about the others too. George II was the last English monarch to lead his army into battle, at Dettingen in 1743.  Interestingly, the Hanoverian period found the British agonising about how deeply they should be involved in European affairs in very much the same terms as they agonise now. The great issue of the early 1730s was whether or not the UK should take an active part in the War of the Polish Succession. Sir Robert Walpole Prime Minister Robert Walpole led the faction determined to keep the British out of European affairs, and was able to declare at one moment: “There are 50,000 men slain in Europe this year and not an Englishman amongst them.” Britain did find itself at war shortly afterwards but Walpole had succinctly made the abstentionist case. And more importantly from our point of view Ernest Augustus and his fellow Hanoverians had helped to build a framework of relationships which would create links lasting long into the future.    The fortunes of the world in the 20th Century were shaped in large measure by the two great global wars. But both conflicts also ended with the UK as part of a victorious alliance in each case leaving behind an army of occupation. Those armies - particularly the second time around - put down deep roots and created Anglo-German families, which in some cases opted to remain in Germany when the father’s British military service was over. It’s just one more example of how global events shape individual lives and even help to explain patterns of migration.     The first task of the British Military Government in 1945 was to disband the Nazi army, restore stability and in many cases bury the dead. But the task quickly became more complex. Feeding Germany became a priority and some food that might have been used to improve the limited rations in the UK were diverted to that purpose. Hugh Pierson, a former serviceman and liaison officer with British forces in Germany, says it took time for the attitude of some in the British forces to change: “There were definitely soldiers that had suffered. So there was resentment on the British part against the Germans, no doubt about it. But I think a lot of the British Army began to understand what had happened to Germany. “It’s one thing to see the odd newsreel of the damage. It’s quite another to live in the country which had been so devastated. And I think there was an element of thinking, ‘We need to help the people get back on their feet.’” There was - in the first months at least - a curfew, and a degree of de-Nazification. British troops showed films of the liberation of concentration camps to German audiences. But it wasn’t long before the rules began to relax and, in their wake, the flourishing of personal relationships which led eventually to the creation of Anglo-German families and thus to a new wave of British settlement. One inevitable tool of fraternisation, as it was charmingly known, was football. By December 1945, only six months after the end of the war in Europe, the German amateur side VfB Detmold was chosen to play against a British Army team - helpfully identified on the promotional poster as an Englische Soldatenmannschaft. History doesn’t record the score but relationships were changing. Not long after that game my own father was playing in a German semi-professional team in Berlin, alongside a demobilised German soldier he’d been responsible for guarding.   More importantly from our point of view, personal relationships were beginning to establish against this most forbidding of backgrounds. These would form the seeds of another wave of British settlement. In Bielefeld in 1945, a British soldier called Jeffrey Wall met his German future wife Ellis. They married in 1947. Jeffrey and Ellis Wall's wedding in 1947 The Walls decided to return to the UK, but plenty of other similar couples eventually decided to make their homes in Germany.  Sometimes the children of those Anglo-German unions made the decision to stay for themselves.       Sheila Barnes settled not far from Hanover because she fell in love here as a young woman.   She’s now lived in the area for 40 years. For 36 of those she has been working in logistics for the quintessentially German firm, Mercedes-Benz. Sheila is entirely integrated into German life and speaks the language fluently. Ask Sheila if the UK now feels like a foreign country and she replies with the curious German hybrid word ‘jein’  - a combination of yes and no. At a more practical level Sheila can see the benefits of having settled in Germany - particularly in times of sickness. After a long and complex period of ill-health, Sheila sums it up: “Healthcare is good here. With my medical insurance I’ve had treatments I couldn’t get in Britain. There are good things about life in Germany.”    The dream of one day living in England hasn’t entirely faded, but there are financial issues to weigh alongside the emotional. “For me that will always be home,” she says of her grandmother’s home near Deal in Kent, “If it wasn’t so flipping expensive, I’d definitely think about moving back, but I’d have to win a million.” That same combination of personal circumstances and financial barriers probably shapes the lives of most immigrants, most of the time. But there's another factor that Sheila has to bear in mind - the views of her father, even though he’s long since died and been cremated. “It would feel wrong to give up my British citizenship,” she says. “My father would have a sandstorm in his little urn.” The same issues of belonging and identity are perhaps even more complicated for Stephanie Thomas, born to a British soldier and the German woman with whom he fell in love.       Stephanie and her older sister stayed in Germany with their German grandparents when their parents moved back to England. Her grandparents - essentially out of kindness - stopped the two girls from speaking English to each other, to speed up the rate at which they learned German. It worked, too. Stephanie sums up her sense of identity like this: “I believe that my brain is English and I learned to be German. I like the English me more than the German me.” Stephanie, who’s now mum to two German-speaking daughters, provides a reminder of how complex the choices migrants face often are. As a teenager, she thought of following in the footsteps of her soldier father and joining the army - except in her case it was the German army. She was talked out of it by her grandfather who had been forced to join the Hitler Youth Movement. There’s a note of wistfulness in part of Stephanie’s story just as there was in Sheila’s - the thought that, for all her German-ness, England is a kind of ultimate home, even though it’s never really been home. “I hope I end up living in England,” she says. “I keep thinking about it. I can’t put the thought aside. Then kids come along and you have to re-organise your own life.” No-one knows yet what the final consequences of Brexit might be, but Stephanie is thinking of applying for a British passport to make it easier to travel to England and back to visit family. While Germany and the UK have both been in the European Union that hasn’t been necessary. EU membership and the freedom of movement it offers means it’s sometimes hard to be sure how many citizens of one member state live - or have lived - in another. But that community of former British soldiers and their children who made the decision to stay in Germany illustrates the point that migratory flows are made up of thousands - and sometimes millions - of individual decisions, shaped by huge historical events. The end of WW2 and the creation of the British Army of the Rhine were two such events. In the uncertain world of Brexit the question is, what pressures will shape the movement of people between Britain and Germany (and the wider world) in the future?     Migration is one of the hardest subjects to analyse, because it’s both universal and intensely personal. Many migrants move as refugees because war, famine and disaster drive them from their homes. Others are motivated by the search for a better life. Movement between countries with roughly similar levels of wealth and development are even harder to analyse.       Source:UN (December2017) International Migration Report     Sometimes migration is a matter of fashion - lots of Americans flooded to the Paris of the 1920s for example. In the early 2000s, something similar happened on a smaller scale with British citizens who had an affinity with Germany, often because they’d studied the language at university. Once again you have a sense of how migration is shaped by a combination of large global factors and small personal decisions. In many parts of the EU, the precise scale of those trends has become hard to measure because movement between member states - in the theology of European integration - wasn’t seen as migration in the traditional sense. That is the essence of the policy of Freedom of Movement. But if key chapters in history, like the shared Hanoverian monarchy and the British military presence, shaped migratory flows in the past, then it’s reasonable to assume that Brexit will provide another, similar moment of change. The official estimate of the number of UK citizens living in Germany is a pleasingly precise 116,470. There is even a symmetry in the way that the number of Germans living in the UK roughly matches the number of British migrants who’ve travelled in the opposite direction - just over 100,000 in each case. The actual number may be slightly higher or lower because it’s not clear exactly how individuals with dual nationality are counted. Germany allows people to hold joint citizenship with another country as long as it’s an EU member state. That’s included the UK until now but may not after Brexit. For that reason the number of British applications for dual nationality or naturalisation has jumped as Brexit looms - from 622 in 2015 to 7,493 in 2017, and what’s anticipated to be a higher number for the next 12-month period to be measured.  Source:Destatis (Federal Statistical Office of Germany)  The effect of Brexit so far has been to create a mood of anxiety among British expatriates in other EU member states. There is uncertainty over how access to state healthcare will be managed in the future and over long-term issues such as arrangements for paying pensions in one country, when they are based on National Insurance contributions in another. Some will have to consider applying for a passport from another member state to protect their status as EU citizens, even if that means giving up British nationality, as it probably will in Germany. Similar factors weigh on the three million or more EU citizens who’ve made their home in the UK. In a field notoriously hard to measure and predict, it seems safe to say that migration between countries like Germany and the UK will continue, even if the legal and political framework around migration changes. That’s because a small minority of people have always been ready to leave their homes and move between countries, and the reasons are often subtle and not likely to be swayed by the prevailing political climate. Often people are driven by a sense of adventure, by job opportunities created through language skills or simply because they fall in love. The question for our age is what pressures will help to shape the movement of people between Britain and Germany and the wider world in the years to come.

"The UK's post-Brexit immigration system will put ""people before passports"", Boris Johnson has said. Speaking at the UK-Africa Investment Summit, the PM said immigration would become ""fairer... treating people the same wherever they come from"". Freedom of movement between the UK and EU is expected to end after the Brexit transition period on 31 December 2020. The government says it willintroduce an Australian-style points based systemby January 2021. Under this system those wanting to work in the UK could be assigned points based on a number of professional and personal characteristics such as education levels. Currently, under freedom of movement, EU citizens do not need a visa to work in the UK, but immigrants from outside the EU are subject to a points system based on English language skills, being sponsored by a company and meeting a salary threshold. BBC Briefing: Your guide to immigration What Brexit could mean for Africa Five times immigration changed the UK Speaking in London, the prime minister said post-Brexit the UK's immigration system would become ""more equal"". ""By putting people before passports we will be able to attract the best talent from around the world, wherever they may be,"" he said. All the main parties are largely behind the idea of a skills-based system. The question here is whether or not the government wants to come up with some kind of control - to put a cap over the top of it. We don't know yet what the government's real position is - it's only got 11 months to find out. In the coming weeks, the government's main advisory body is going to report back on some of these questions. It is only then we'll have some answers about what the PM's direction of travel is. Speaking at the summit, Mr Johnson sought to encourage investment in the UK describing the country as a ""one-stop shop for the ambitious growing international economy"". He also promised the UK would no longer provide ""any new direct official development assistance, investment, export credit or trade promotion for thermal coal mining or coal power plants overseas"". ""Not another penny of UK taxpayers' money will be directly invested in digging up coal or burning it for electricity,"" he said. ""There's no point in the UK reducing the amount of coal we burn if we then trundle over to Africa and line our pockets by encouraging African states to use more of it,"" he said. ""Instead we are going to focus on supporting the transition to lower and zero carbon alternatives."" According to the Department for International Development, the UK has not provided bilateral official development assistance for coal-fire power generation and coal mining since 2012. It says that in the future direct support for thermal coal mining and coal-fired power plants from the Department for International Trade will be stopped and refocused on other activity. Commenting on the government's UK-Africa Investment Summit, shadow international development minister Preet Kaur Gill said: ""The Conservatives will continue to misuse the country's aid budget to prop up the needs of business elites rather than spend it on tackling global poverty, inequality and the climate crisis. ""Trade and investment deals are not a panacea for ending poverty, especially when they're written in line with the demands of big business, and don't have safeguards in place to protect public services or ensure the most marginalised groups aren't left behind.""

"This video can not be played The BBC spoke to people in Beijing who seemed largely unconcerned about the virus The number of people infected with a new virus in China tripled over the weekend, with the outbreak spreading from Wuhan to other major cities. There are now more than 200 cases, mostly in Wuhan, though the respiratory illness has also been detected in Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen. Three people have died. Japan, Thailand and South Korea have reported cases. The new strain of coronavirus, which causes a type of pneumonia, can pass from person to person, China confirmed. Respiratory expert Zhong Nanshan, who heads the health commission team investigating the virus, said 14 medical workers had caught it while treating patients, state media reported. The sharp rise comes as millions of Chinese prepare to travel for the Lunar New Year holidays. Although the outbreak is believed to have originated from a market, officials and scientists are yet to determine exactly how it has been spreading. Mystery Chinese virus: How worried should we be? New Chinese virus 'preventable and controllable' The outbreak has revived memories of the Sars virus - also a coronavirus - that killed 774 people in the early 2000s across dozens of countries, mostly in Asia.  Analysis of the genetic code of the new virus shows it is more closely related to Sars than any other human coronavirus. Experts in the UK told the BBCthe number of people infected could still be far greaterthan official figures suggest, with estimates closer to 1,700. 2019-nCoV, as it's been labelled, is understood to be a new strain of coronavirus that has not previously been identified in humans Coronaviruses are a broad family of viruses, but only six (the new one would make it seven) are known to infect people Scientists believe an animal source is ""the most likely primary source"" but that some human-to-human transmission has occurred Signs of infection include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties People are being advised to avoid ""unprotected"" contact with live animals, thoroughly cook meat and eggs, and avoid close contact with anyone with cold or flu-like symptoms Source: World Health Organization Authorities in Wuhan, a central Chinese city of 11 million that has been at the heart of the outbreak, on Monday said 136 new cases had been confirmed over the weekend, with a third person dying of the virus. There had previously been only 62 confirmed cases in the city. As of late Sunday, officials said 170 people in Wuhan were still being treated in hospital, including nine in critical condition. Beijing also confirmed its first cases, with five people infected. Shanghai confirmed its first case on Monday - a 56-year-old woman who came from Wuhan. Airports including Narita in Tokyo have been screening passengers In the city of Shenzhen, a major tech hub close to Hong Kong, officials said a 66-year-old man showed symptoms of the virus following a trip to visit relatives in Wuhan. State media reported 14 other cases in Guangdong province. Four cases have been confirmed abroad - two in Thailand, one in Japan and one in South Korea - all of them involving people who are either from Wuhan or have visited the city. In South Korea, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said a 35-year-old Chinese woman was suffering from a fever and respiratory problems after travelling there from Wuhan. She was put into isolation and treated at a local hospital. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The World Health Organization said it was currently not recommending restrictions on travel or trade, but was providing guidance to countries preparing for any outbreak. Airports in Singapore, Hong Kong and the Japanese capital Tokyo have been screening air passengers from Wuhan, and US authorities last week announced similar measures at three major airports in San Francisco, Los Angeles and New York. How China is responding to the outbreak is under close scrutiny, given that it was widely criticised for initially covering up the Sars crisis in late 2002 and early 2003. On Monday, Chinese President Xi Jinping for the first time publicly addressed the outbreak, saying that the virus must be ""resolutely contained"". The foreign ministry, meanwhile, said China was providing ""timely information about the disease"" and would ""work with all parties to deal with the virus"". China's National Health Commission on Monday confirmed that two cases in China were due to human-to-human transmission, state-run Xinhua news agency reported. The commission had earlier said there had been no such cases, but that the virus had instead crossed the species barrier and come from infected animals at a seafood and wildlife market in Wuhan. Health officials have been analysing the seafood market where they believe the virus originated The WHO also said it believed there had been ""some limited human-to-human transmission occurring between close contacts"". ""As moreâ¦ cases are identified and more analysis undertaken, we will get a clearer picture of disease severity and transmission patterns,"" it wrote on Twitter. It noted that the rise in cases in China was a result of ""increased searching and testing for [the virus] among people sick with respiratory illness"". This video can not be played Coronavirus feared to have infected more than initially thought according to scientists From Friday, most Chinese will begin their week-long Lunar New Year holidays. It's a time when hundreds of millions travel around China to visit family, raising fears that authorities will not be able to adequately monitor further spread of the disease. Wuhan is a transport hub and authorities there have for nearly a week been using temperature scanners at airports, and train and bus stations. Those showing signs of fever have been registered, given masks and taken to hospitals and clinics. Chinese companies shut down for Lunar New Year, with hundreds of millions of people travelling Authorities say they will now also be screening everyone leaving the city. At Beijing's central railway station, some travellers donned masks but did not appear overly concerned about the virus. ""Watching the news, I do feel a little worried. But I haven't taken precautionary measures beyond wearing regular masks,"" Li Yang, a 28-year-old account manager travelling to the region of Inner Mongolia, told the AFP news agency. But the tone in Chinese social media, where the outbreak has been a top trending topic, was different. ""Who knows how many people who have been to Wuhan may be unaware that they have already been infected?"" one Weibo user said.

"This video can not be played HS2: How much work has already been done? The transport secretary has asked for more data before making a ""massive decision"" on HS2 as it emerged the new high-speed rail link could cost Â£106bn. A leaked report suggested the project could cost almost double from the Â£56bn expected in 2015. Grant Shapps said he has demanded more information about the scheme as the government prepares to decide whether to go ahead with the project. Downing Street refused to comment on the contents of the leaked report. Mr Shapps told Sky News that the ""massive decision"" on whether to go ahead with HS2 ""needs to be fact-based"". He said he had told the report's author, Doug Oakervee: ""Give me the facts, give me the data, give us the information so we can make a proper informed decision."" The unpublished report, which wasleaked to the Financial Times,external, said there was ""considerable risk"" that estimated costs could rise by another 20%. ""I've always approached this from a relatively neutral point of view and that information will help to inform a decision that is best for the whole country,"" Mr Shapps said. ""We'll be making a final decision, along with the prime minister and the chancellor, on this very shortly,"" he added. This video can not be played What does a billion pounds look like... and what can it buy? The governmentpreviously promised to make a decisionbefore the end of 2019. Along with a warning on costs, the report also made a number of suggestions. Among those was a recommendation to pause the second phase of the project while experts look at whether conventional lines could help link Birmingham to Manchester and Leeds instead. But the Mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, told the BBC's Today programme it would ""not be acceptable"" if the North of England portion of HS2 was delayed or downgraded to slower speeds. ""To me that would be the same old story. London to Birmingham, money is no object, and then all the penny pinching is done in the North of England,"" he said. Will HS2 ever get built? HS2 'threatens' natural habitats, report warns Mr Burnham said the development of an east-west rail route across the North - known as HS3 or Northern Powerhouse Rail - relied on HS2 being built. However, Lord Berkeley, a vocal critic of HS2 who was deputy chairman of the review before withdrawing his backing, said: ""I suspect that most of the people who like to use the trains around Manchester and Leeds would rather have a really good commuter service just like there is in London, rather than get to London half an hour quicker."" Some Â£8bn has already been spent on the project, which will connect London, the Midlands and northern England using trains capable of travelling at 250mph. West Midlands' mayor Andy Street said he still expected the project to go ahead. ""It will drive the regeneration of our economies in Birmingham, in Manchester, in Leeds and other cities in the Midlands and the North,"" he told the BBC. ""No government committed to levelling up around the country would possibly turn its back on that opportunity.""  Â£55.6bnExisting budget Â£32.7bnOriginal budget Â£7.4bnAlready spent on the project 9,000Jobs supported by the railway 345 milesNew high-speed track 50 minutesJourney time saving between London and Manchester In a letter to Prime Minister Boris Johnson some of the UK's largest construction firms warned that cancelling the project would do ""irreparable damage"" to the industry, costing thousands of jobs,the Times newspaper reported,external. Balfour Beatty, Skanska, Morgan Sindall, Costain, Mace and Sir Robert McAlpine are among firms arguing that a dearth of other big projects mean skills could be lost. Claire Walker, co-executive director of policy at the British Chambers of Commerce, told the BBC that the project must go ahead. ""Business communities are united that this project should be delivered and should be delivered in full,"" she said. ""There is no project that has been proposed that will go so far in delivering the transformational change to the Northern business communities as this project will."" A proposed design for an HS2 train The first phase of project, between London and Birmingham, is due to open at the end of 2026, with the second phase to Leeds and Manchester expected to be completed by 2032-33. Despite concerns about the rail link, Europe's largest infrastructure project, work is not on hold and the project currently gets through about Â£250m a month. ""The North's civic and business leaders have argued tirelessly that major infrastructure investment is so badly needed to provide the capacity so urgently needed on our rail network,"" said Northern Powerhouse Partnership Director, Henri Murison. Trains on the London to Birmingham route would be 400m-long (1,300ft) with up to 1,100 seats. They would run as many as 14 times per hour in each direction. The Department for Transport says the project will cut journey times between the cities from one hour 21 minutes to 52 minutes. Once the second phase is complete, Manchester to London journeys would take one hour seven minutes (down from two hours seven minutes), and Birmingham to Leeds would take 49 minutes (down from two hours). This would effectively reduce journey times between London and Edinburgh and London and Glasgow by an hour, to three-and-a-half hours. The government hopes its creation will free up capacity on overcrowded commuter routes. If you've followed the HS2 drama, then an estimate of Â£106bn for the entire project isn't surprising. But the fact that it's in yet another leaked draft of the government's review makes it part of the official narrative. Those opposed to HS2 feel a perfect storm is brewing. Conservative MPs (including ones newly elected in constituencies in the north of England) are pressing the PM to reconsider; the government's spending watchdog will soon publish a critical report; and Boris Johnson's transport advisor, Andrew Gilligan, is sceptical about the scheme. Tinkering with the project (reducing the speed of the trains or adding a station in between Birmingham and London) won't save much money and would slow the line down, defeating the point of it being super-high speed. So, in broad terms, it feels like the government has an all-or-nothing decision to make. HS2 currently burns about Â£250m a month, so you'd think the government would be in a hurry to make up its mind. But the fact we're told this 'isn't a final draft' of the review (even though we were previously told that the review should have been done at the end of last year) suggests government insiders are keeping their options open. A decision will probably come, I'm told, after Brexit. HS2 has always been split into fairly distinct parts (Phases 1, 2a and 2b) so putting the second phases on hold for a bit longer while further options are explored wouldn't in itself be a radical option. But the project has a lot of support from political and business leaders in the north of England and the Midlands, so if the government was then to scale back that second stretch of the railway it would cause a bit of a storm. HS2 should happen despite rising cost, review says HS2 costs out of control, says review deputy chair HS2 'threatens' natural habitats, report warns What is HS2 and why scrap the Manchester link?

"China has for years been struggling to deal with the rubbish its 1.4 billion citizens generate China, one of the world's biggest users of plastic, has unveiled a major plan to reduce single-use plastics across the country. Non-degradable bags will be banned in major cities by the end of 2020 and in all cities and towns by 2022. The restaurant industry will also be banned from using single-use straws by the end of 2020. China has for years been struggling to deal with the rubbish its 1.4 billion citizens generate. The country's largest rubbish dump - the size of around 100 football fields - is already full, 25 years ahead of schedule. China's mega-dump already full In 2017 alone, China collected 215 million tonnes of urban household waste. But national figures for recycling are not available. China produced 60 million tonnes of plastic waste in 2010, followed by the US at 38 million tonnes,according to online publication Our World in Data based at the University of Oxford.,external The research was published in 2018 and said the ""relative global picture is similar in projections up to 2025"". The National Development and Reform Commission on Sunday issued the new policy, which will be implemented over the next five years. Plastic bags will be banned across all cities and towns in 2022, though markets selling fresh produce will be exempt until 2025. The production and sale of plastic bags that are less than 0.025mm thick will also be banned. The restaurant industry must reduce the use of single-use plastic items by 30%. Hotels have been told that they must not offer free single-use plastic items by 2025. By Roger Harrabin, BBC environment analyst The broadcaster David Attenborough has warned that the planet can't be protected unless China changes its polluting ways. Suddenly that's just starting to happen. Following Beijing's clampdown on plastic, there's now to be a ban on illegally produced wood. This video can not be played The scientists trying to tackle illegal logging For 20 years, China's demand for raw materials has been a massive driver of illegal logging, especially in South-East Asia and Africa. It's said to be the single largest international consumer of illegally-felled wood. Now Beijing has amended its law to help timber-producing countries trying to tackle corruption in forestry. It says it aims to protect forestry resources and supports a ban on the cutting of natural forests. The UK-based Environmental Investigation Bureau said the news was thrilling, but critics will note that the central government tried to force provincial governors to stop building coal-fired power stations - but failed to impose its will. This isn't China's first campaign against the use of plastics. In 2008, the country banned retailers from giving out free plastic bags, andbanned the production,externalof ultra-thin plastic bags. And in 2017, China - once the world's largest importer of plastic waste - announced that it would ban the import of foreign plastic waste. Who's sending back plastic waste? The small town with a dirty secret A blockage in global waste disposal China is not the only country in Asia that has cracked down against single-use plastics. Thailand announced earlier this year that single-use plastic bags would be banned in major stores, with a complete ban across the entire country in 2021. Indonesia's capital Jakarta also is banning single-use plastic bags in department stores, supermarkets and traditional markets by June 2020. The Indonesian island of Bali has also banned single-use plastic.

""[We] will take the necessary steps to ensure that Malaysia does not become the garbage dump of the world,"" Environment Minister Yeo Bee Yin said on Monday. She added that there were plans to send back further containers in the near future. Wealthier countries have been sending plastic waste to Malaysia since 2018, but officials say they are struggling to cope with the amount that is being brought in illegally.

"Tony Hall outside the BBC's London HQ Tony Hall is to step down as director general of the BBC in the summer, after seven years in the role. Lord Hall said the decision had been hard, adding: ""If I followed my heart I would genuinely never want to leave."" But he said he felt it was important the BBC had the same leader for the BBC's mid-term review in 2022 and the renewal of its charter in 2027. The National Gallerysubsequently announced,externalhe had been appointed chair of its board of trustees. The BBC's chairman, Sir David Clementi, said the search for the BBC's next leader would begin ""within the next few weeks"". He added that the BBC was ""committed to selecting the best-qualified person for the job"". BBC Newsnight understands Lord Hall had wanted to stay until the BBC's centenary in 2022, but after ""big discussions with the board"" it was decided he would go earlier. The programme's political editor Nicholas Watt said the timing was being interpreted in government circles as ""something of a masterstroke"" by Sir David, whose term as chairman ends in 2021. ""Had Tony Hall waited until 2022 it would have been a new chairman of the BBC making the appointment, and that new chairman would have been appointed by Boris Johnson's government,"" said the correspondent. James Purnell, the former Labour politicianwho became the BBC's director of radio and education in 2016, is currently the bookmakers' favourite to take on the role. Fran Unsworth,the BBC's director of news and current affairs, is another contender, as is Anne Bulford,the BBC's first female deputy director general, who left the corporation last year. Media commentators are also speculating, withThe Independent's Adam Sherwin,externalsuggesting Channel 4's chief executive Alex Mahon might be in the frame, along with Apple's Jay Hunt and Charlotte Moore, the BBC's director of content. The Guardian also points to these female candidates,externalbut also suggests former Ofcom chief Sharon White and Gail Rebuck, chair of Penguin Random House UK, might be in contention. Newsnight's Nicholas Watt said he was hearing that the cabinet ""are expecting the BBC to sound them out on this appointment"", and there was ""no appetite"" in the government for ""a BBC lifer"" who is not interested in reform. Speaking of Lord Hall, Sir David said the corporation had been ""lucky to have him"". He described him as ""an inspirational creative leader"" who had ""led the BBC with integrity and a passion for our values"". Samira Ahmed recently won an employment tribunal she brought against the BBC Culture secretary Nicky Morgan thanked Lord Hall for his service, saying he had made ""a huge contribution to public service broadcasting in his career"". ""In this ever changing broadcast landscape the next DG will need to build on Lord Hall's success,""she wrote on Twitter,external. In a letter to staff, Lord Hall said he believed he would be ""leaving the BBC in a much stronger place than when I joined"". His appointment in 2012 followed the resignation of George Entwistle in the wake of theNewsnight Lord McAlpine row. Lord Hall said the BBC felt ""a very different organisation"" that was ""more innovative, more open, more inclusive, more efficient [and] more commercially aware"". The director general, or DG, is the chief executive officer of the BBC, its editor-in-chief. The person in the post is the editorial, operational and creative leader of the corporation, with responsibility for a worldwide workforce running services across television, radio and online. The DG and the BBC board are responsible for the effective running of the BBC, delivering its public service and commercial services - including BBC Studios  - both at home and abroad. The DG is appointed by the BBC board. As of April 2019, the holder of the post is paid Â£450,000 a year. ""Change has been tough at times,"" he wrote. ""But I believe our recent record of transformation stands comparison with virtually any other creative organisation in the world."" Lord Hall takes over at the National Gallery in London from interim chair Sir John Kingman, who has been in the post since Hannah Rothschild's departure in September 2019. He said: ""I am proud to take on the role of its chair. The National Gallery isn't just about serving those who already love art, but reaching a wider audience and future generations."" His appointment was welcomed by Baroness Morgan, who said he would bring ""a wealth of experience"" to the role. This video can not be played BBC media editor Amol Rajan says Lord Hall's successor will need ""phenomenal skills"" Director general of the BBC is one of the most privileged, but also one of the most relentless and tough jobs in Britain - and it gets tougher every day, because of the technological context. His successor will need to combine world-class political, commercial, editorial and managerial talent, while coming under a relentless barrage of criticism from all fronts. The question of who gets it will depend on where the BBC Board and its chairman, Sir David Clementi, want to place their emphasis. Someone with commercial nous, or someone who can charm Boris Johnson and Dominic Cummings? Someone with a track record at managing talent - or someone who can make a brave, correct call on a Panorama investigation? The perfect candidate will be able to do all this - and therefore doesn't exist. Read more from Amol here Lord Hall's departure from the BBC comes amid another turbulent time for the broadcaster, with issues around equal pay disputes, political bias, diversity and TV licences at the top of its agenda. June Sarpong said she relished ""the challenge... to make the BBC more inclusive."" Earlier this month presenter Samira Ahmed won an employment tribunal in a dispute over equal pay, while radio presenter Sarah Montague has confirmed she won a settlement and an apology from the BBC after being treated ""unequally"". Samira Ahmed wins BBC equal pay tribunal Montague confirms Â£400k BBC equal pay settlement The BBC has also faced criticism over its reporting on therecent general election,presenter pay,star salariesand alack of diversityboth on and off screen. It also found itself in the spotlight back in 2018 whenSir Cliff Richard won a High Court case against the broadcasterover its coverage of a police raid on his home. Last year TV presenter and campaigner June Sarpong was appointed the BBC's first director of creative diversity in a bid to improve the BBC's ""on-air talent portrayal"". June Sarpong appointed BBC diversity director Sarpong said it had been a ""great pleasure and honour"" to work under Lord Hall's ""visionary leadership"". ""I cannot overstate the support he has shown me in helping to start the process of inclusive change,""she wrote on Twitter,external. ""He will be sincerely missed."" Other developments during Lord Hall's tenure include the growth of BBC iPlayer, the increasingsuccess of BBC Studios.and the launches of BBC Sounds and streaming service Britbox. It was also announced last yearthat free TV licences for all over 75s would be scrapped and replaced by a scheme based on pension credit benefit. Lord Hall is the BBC's 16th director general Last weekLord Hall outlined a planthat will see at least two thirds of the corporation's staff based outside London by 2027. Lord Hall, 68, joined the corporation as a trainee in the Belfast newsroom in 1973. He became editor of the Nine O'Clock News at the age of 34 and was appointed chief executive of BBC News in 1996. While there, he launched BBC Radio 5 Live, the news channel, the BBC News website and the parliament channel. He left in 2001 to become the chief executive of the the Royal Opera House until 2013, and was also deputy chairman of Channel 4. He was also on the board of the London organising committee for the Olympic Games before returning to the BBC in the top job. Lord Hall, whose official title is The Lord Hall of Birkenhead, was made a cross-bench peer in 2010. Bonnie Greer, who served alongside Lord Hall on the Royal Opera House board, noted that the BBC had been going through a difficult period. ""I think it's been a lot of pressure for the organisation and a lot of pressure for him,"" the playwright and critic said on The Victoria Derbyshire Show. Lord Hall with Alice Webb, director of BBC Children's, and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge in November 2018 Talent agent Jonathan Shalit said Lord Hall had been ""fantastic"" in the director general role and that it was ""normal"" for someone in his position to move on after seven years. ""He was going to be moving on soon,"" he told the same BBC programme. ""I think the point he makes about making sure one person oversees the midway point of the licence fee is important."" Philippa Childs, head of broadcast trade union Bectu, said Lord Hall had been ""a strong advocate for the BBC, its staff [and] the licence fee"". She said the outgoing director general had always ""acted with integrity and transparency"" during their ""extremely positive and productive working relationship"". Veteran presenter David Dimbleby said Lord Hall ""revived the place"" because of his passion for broadcasting. On the future of the BBC, Dimbleby added: ""It's always worth remembering, I think in the end, people trust the BBC more than the politicians who try to diminish it. ""I'm not saying there aren't major, major problems with the BBC at the moment; I think there are."" Former BBC chairman Michael Grade said he did not believe that Sir David, or the BBC board, would allow the government to interfere with the appointment of the director general.

"This video can not be played 'We've had no apology after our baby died' Cwm Taf Morgannwg health board has made ""good progress"" in recent months in dealing with serious failings in its maternity services although there remains ""much more to be done"". Asecond quarterly report of an independent panel,externalis ""cautiously optimistic"" of long term improvements. But there are still big challenges, with a backlog of complaints a ""matter of concern"". Maternity services were put into special measures last April. It follows an investigation by two royal colleges, which found mothers faced ""distressing experiences and poor care"" at Prince Charles Hospital in Merthyr Tydfil and the Royal Glamorgan Hospital near Llantrisant. The services were said to be ""under extreme pressure"" and ""dysfunctional"", after an investigation looking at 25 serious incidents going back to 2016. The independent panel was appointed by the Welsh Government. Q&A: Cwm Taf maternity problems Damning report into failings not flagged up Maternity services in special measures after review Mothers ignored and made to feel worthless Chairman of the panel Mick Giannasi said the most important ""big ticket"" actions have been achieved, and as a result families could be more confident about the quality of care currently being provided. This includes dealing with staff shortages across maternity units, although more work is needed to tackle staff sickness and an over-reliance on overtime and agency staff. Staff training has also been improved. Overseeing improvements in maternity services - with 79 different action points - to ensure plans are robust and properly scrutinised Reviewing cases over a potential 10 years - the 43 cases highlighted by the initial inquiry (2016-18) and then looking at the previous six years and possibly a further two years Engaging with mothers and families to ensure their voices are heard. Progress is being shared with them every three months, at the same time as the minister, before they are made public.The first report was last October. Compiling lessons for Cwm Taf and maternity services elsewhere According to the panel there is other evidence of progress - with a recent inspection of the newly established Tirion midwife-led birth centre at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital describing ""care being provided in a safe and effective manner"" and in a ""homely, relaxed environment"". A further Health Inspectorate Wales inspection into the consultant-led maternity unit at the Prince Charles Hospital is due to be published shortly. ""We're cautiously optimistic,"" said Mr Giannasi. ""We don't want to convey a sense that this job is done because it isn't by any means but what we do want to convey is a sense that they're making significant progress and they're on the right track."" Rebecca Walker with her husband Jeff and daughter say Oliver will always be part of the family Rebecca Walker, from Mountain Ash, lost her premature baby Oliver when he was three weeks old in 2015. Because of fertility issues she had been under consultant care at Prince Charles Hospital. But when she suffered a bleed when on a family holiday with her husband Jeff in Greece, she was kept in hospital and given scans and medication, with doctors saying Prince Charles Hospital needed to take a look at the scans when she returned. Back home, she had gone to hospital but was sent home. ""It was worrying because I had been fine. I went back twice as something was not right."" Rebecca with baby Oliver in intensive care When visiting family in London she went into labour prematurely and baby Oliver was born at 26 weeks in June in a hospital in Surrey. He was put into intensive care but died three weeks later. ""He was too fragile to be transferred home - he had lots of different, complex issues. He was just too poorly."" They had nothing but praise for the care he had in Surrey and Greece - but after a long grieving process, in 2016 they wanted to find out what happened in Merthyr Tydfil, sought help and went to the local community health council. ""We've always said we've seen the best and worst of the NHS,"" said Rebecca. ""Jeff said he felt there was something not right."" In 2019, Cwm Taf health board agreed they had breached their duty of care to Rebecca, after the scans from Greece were examined again. ""On that night we came back from Greece, Rebecca should have been admitted to hospital,"" said Jeff, 49. ""But to this day, no apology - and that's what we wanted, for someone to explain to us."" The Walkers want to make sure no other couples go through what they had to Although given counselling, Rebecca, now 41, felt there was little support as a couple, while the legal process was a huge strain. When Rebecca heard about the wider problems she wanted to be involved - and is satisfied with those looking to improve things. ""The oversight panel have got a massive job and have got the right people in posts, are structured well and know what they need to do,"" said Rebecca. ""I think it's a bigger job than they originally thought."" ""We've got some answers but the whole process we went through was wrong. The whole bereavement process, how that worked for me, how is that working now?"" ""People need to know how it affects not just us but the whole family so it doesn't just keep happening again. We'll keep talking about it as there are lots of people who can't talk about it. ""Oliver was part of the family and always will be, that's just our life now - we're different people now. ""If any good can come out of that - we're prepared to help the health board and oversight panel to ensure the changes they say they'll make are made."" Mr Giannasi believes that, although the health board needs to improve its culture, there has been a huge amount of effort from staff to make a difference. ""What we're seeing is a real change in behaviours, a real change in attitudes and the bottom line is that the feedback we're now getting from women is fundamentally different to the picture the royal colleges painted 12 months ago,"" he said. Health Minister Vaughan Gething said he was pleased the health board was making progress,externaland he expected it to continue. He said there was a ""large and very sensitive exercise"" to review around 140 pregnancies. Mr Gething said this would take some time to complete but it was vital the reviews were completed ""thoroughly and not quickly"". Plaid Cymru health spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth accused Mr Gething of ""still siding with those responsible for management failings"". He added: ""It is questionable whether changes in culture can occur without significant changes to the culture of the NHS management itself which has failed miserably to hold any manager to account for the failures that have been seen in Cwm Taf"". Greg Dix, Cwm Taf's director of nursing, midwifery and patient care, said the health board recognised there was still much to do, particularly around complaints processes and culture. ""It is absolutely vital that we learn from the past and the continued engagement with families who have used our services,"" he said. ""The clinical reviews and ongoing advice of the panel will support us to fully implement the recommendations of the Royal Colleges' report and ensure that continual improvements are in place for the future.""

"Madonna's Madame X tour is due to come to the UK next month Madonna has cancelled another show on her Madame X world tour, as she battles an ongoing, but unspecified, injury. The star gave fans in Lisbon just 45 minutes' notice that her show on Sunday night was being called off. ""We regret to inform you that Madonna is unable to perform this evening,"" an email informed ticketholders at 19:45. She had been due on stage at 20:30. ""Sorry I had to cancel tonight,""the star wrote on Instagram,external, ""but I must listen to my body and rest!"" It is the eighth time Madonna has had to cancel a show on her current world tour, which sees her playing smaller, intimate theatre venues. She has not revealed the nature her injury, but told one audience in San Francisco she was suffering from a ""torn ligament"" and ""a bad knee"" in November. In a video posted to social media last week, she was shown wearing knee supports while rehearsing for an earlier show in Lisbon. ""How an injured Madame X warms up for a show,"" she wrote in the caption. ""Very carefully."" The star has also shared videos of her taking post-show ice baths to help her cope with ""multiple injuries"" that are causing ""overwhelming pain"". Allow Instagram content?

Madonna began the current stage of her Madame X tour in Portugal's Coliseu Dis Recreios theatre on 12 January, and had seemed to be in good spirits, interacting with the crowd and drinking port on stage. The star said it was her first drink ""in a month"" and that it had ""got her through"" the strenuous show. She also joked about her ""25 injuries"" and told the audience ""don't pay attention to what goes on from the waist down"",reported Lisbon-based music magazine Blitz,external. The star also traded high heels for flat shoes during last Thursday's concert. ""They are very ugly but it was either wear these boots or cancel the show,""the star was quoted as saying by the Portuguese website Sapo,external. Madonna said she hoped the tour would resume this week, writing on Instagram: ""See you on Tuesday, fingers crossed."" The show is due to come to the UK on 27 January, with 15 dates planned at the London Palladium. Anger and recrimination might well have been expected among the Madonna fans who crowded outside the historic Coliseu Dos Recreios in the heart of Lisbon to hear the news they dreaded. Many had flown in from around the world to see their ""queen"" grace the intimate venue, just a few miles from her new Portuguese home. But as they took photos of the cancellation notices posted on the door, less than an hour before the official start time, there was plenty of understanding and concern for the injured star. After all, fans are fully aware that this is an all-out performer, battling against injury, who offers no compromise on stage. Madonna started out as a dancer and, even at 61, this is a show where her on-stage movement is as much a part of the act as her singing. One fan who summed up his own frustration by posting a single-finger message to Madonna was quickly joined online by others speculating that she may need to postpone the rest of her tour, including 15 dates at the London Palladium next month. But as a Coliseu staff member, standing at the door that remained resolutely shut, told me: ""She did a great show here last night so you and the other fans here tonight are really unlucky.""

"This video can not be played The BBC spoke to people in Beijing who seemed largely unconcerned about the virus The number of people infected with a new virus in China tripled over the weekend, with the outbreak spreading from Wuhan to other major cities. There are now more than 200 cases, mostly in Wuhan, though the respiratory illness has also been detected in Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen. Three people have died. Japan, Thailand and South Korea have reported cases. The new strain of coronavirus, which causes a type of pneumonia, can pass from person to person, China confirmed. Respiratory expert Zhong Nanshan, who heads the health commission team investigating the virus, said 14 medical workers had caught it while treating patients, state media reported. The sharp rise comes as millions of Chinese prepare to travel for the Lunar New Year holidays. Although the outbreak is believed to have originated from a market, officials and scientists are yet to determine exactly how it has been spreading. Mystery Chinese virus: How worried should we be? New Chinese virus 'preventable and controllable' The outbreak has revived memories of the Sars virus - also a coronavirus - that killed 774 people in the early 2000s across dozens of countries, mostly in Asia.  Analysis of the genetic code of the new virus shows it is more closely related to Sars than any other human coronavirus. Experts in the UK told the BBCthe number of people infected could still be far greaterthan official figures suggest, with estimates closer to 1,700. 2019-nCoV, as it's been labelled, is understood to be a new strain of coronavirus that has not previously been identified in humans Coronaviruses are a broad family of viruses, but only six (the new one would make it seven) are known to infect people Scientists believe an animal source is ""the most likely primary source"" but that some human-to-human transmission has occurred Signs of infection include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties People are being advised to avoid ""unprotected"" contact with live animals, thoroughly cook meat and eggs, and avoid close contact with anyone with cold or flu-like symptoms Source: World Health Organization Authorities in Wuhan, a central Chinese city of 11 million that has been at the heart of the outbreak, on Monday said 136 new cases had been confirmed over the weekend, with a third person dying of the virus. There had previously been only 62 confirmed cases in the city. As of late Sunday, officials said 170 people in Wuhan were still being treated in hospital, including nine in critical condition. Beijing also confirmed its first cases, with five people infected. Shanghai confirmed its first case on Monday - a 56-year-old woman who came from Wuhan. Airports including Narita in Tokyo have been screening passengers In the city of Shenzhen, a major tech hub close to Hong Kong, officials said a 66-year-old man showed symptoms of the virus following a trip to visit relatives in Wuhan. State media reported 14 other cases in Guangdong province. Four cases have been confirmed abroad - two in Thailand, one in Japan and one in South Korea - all of them involving people who are either from Wuhan or have visited the city. In South Korea, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said a 35-year-old Chinese woman was suffering from a fever and respiratory problems after travelling there from Wuhan. She was put into isolation and treated at a local hospital. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The World Health Organization said it was currently not recommending restrictions on travel or trade, but was providing guidance to countries preparing for any outbreak. Airports in Singapore, Hong Kong and the Japanese capital Tokyo have been screening air passengers from Wuhan, and US authorities last week announced similar measures at three major airports in San Francisco, Los Angeles and New York. How China is responding to the outbreak is under close scrutiny, given that it was widely criticised for initially covering up the Sars crisis in late 2002 and early 2003. On Monday, Chinese President Xi Jinping for the first time publicly addressed the outbreak, saying that the virus must be ""resolutely contained"". The foreign ministry, meanwhile, said China was providing ""timely information about the disease"" and would ""work with all parties to deal with the virus"". China's National Health Commission on Monday confirmed that two cases in China were due to human-to-human transmission, state-run Xinhua news agency reported. The commission had earlier said there had been no such cases, but that the virus had instead crossed the species barrier and come from infected animals at a seafood and wildlife market in Wuhan. Health officials have been analysing the seafood market where they believe the virus originated The WHO also said it believed there had been ""some limited human-to-human transmission occurring between close contacts"". ""As moreâ¦ cases are identified and more analysis undertaken, we will get a clearer picture of disease severity and transmission patterns,"" it wrote on Twitter. It noted that the rise in cases in China was a result of ""increased searching and testing for [the virus] among people sick with respiratory illness"". This video can not be played Coronavirus feared to have infected more than initially thought according to scientists From Friday, most Chinese will begin their week-long Lunar New Year holidays. It's a time when hundreds of millions travel around China to visit family, raising fears that authorities will not be able to adequately monitor further spread of the disease. Wuhan is a transport hub and authorities there have for nearly a week been using temperature scanners at airports, and train and bus stations. Those showing signs of fever have been registered, given masks and taken to hospitals and clinics. Chinese companies shut down for Lunar New Year, with hundreds of millions of people travelling Authorities say they will now also be screening everyone leaving the city. At Beijing's central railway station, some travellers donned masks but did not appear overly concerned about the virus. ""Watching the news, I do feel a little worried. But I haven't taken precautionary measures beyond wearing regular masks,"" Li Yang, a 28-year-old account manager travelling to the region of Inner Mongolia, told the AFP news agency. But the tone in Chinese social media, where the outbreak has been a top trending topic, was different. ""Who knows how many people who have been to Wuhan may be unaware that they have already been infected?"" one Weibo user said.

"This video can not be played Watch Mostert's four touchdowns in 49ers win The San Francisco 49ers defeated the Green Bay Packers 37-20 to win the NFC Championship and will now play the Kansas City Chiefs in Super Bowl 54 on 2 February in Miami. Raheem Mostert ran in four touchdowns as the 49ers took control, with the Packers, who trailed 27-0 at half-time, scoring two Aaron Jones touchdowns and another from Jace Sternberger. The Chiefs beat the Tennessee Titans 35-24 in the AFC Championship game earlier on Sunday to secure a first Super Bowl appearance in 50 years. This will be the 49ers' first Super Bowl since 2013 when they lost 34-31 to the Baltimore Ravens in New Orleans. Sunday's AFC and NFC Championship matches as they happened The 49ers have won it five times, but their last success came 25 years ago when they beat the San Diego Chargers 49-26 in Super Bowl 29, which was also held in Miami. It has been a remarkable turnaround for Kyle Shanahan's side, who had a 4-12 record in the 2018 regular season, compared to 13-3 in this campaign. They had thrashed Green Bay 37-8 in week 12 in November and were completely dominant in the first half against the Packers at Levi's Stadium. Mostert's first touchdown saw him sprint in from 36 yards, before Robbie Gould's huge 54-yard field goal gave the hosts a 10-0 lead early in the second quarter. Two further scores from Mostert - from nine and 18 yards - gave the 49ers a 27-0 lead and meant he became the first player in NFL history with 150+ rush yards and three rush touchdowns in a single half of a playoff game. Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers found Jones for a nine-yard touchdown early in the third, but Mostert soon ran in from 22 yards for his fourth touchdown - the most from any player in an NFC Championship match. Jones bundled over from one yard for his second touchdown of the day for the Packers, who then missed a two-point conversion attempt when Davante Adams could not hold on. However, Rodgers' eight-yard pass to Jace Sternberger brought the Packers to within 14 points after a 65-yard pass to Davante Adams had set up the chance. The Packers were aiming to reach their first Super Bowl since beating the Pittsburgh Steelers 31-25 in Super Bowl 45 in February 2011 but could not do enough to complete a fightback against the 49ers, with Gould's 42-yard field goal sealing the home victory. ""I just woke up like it was any other game,"" said Mostert of his stellar display. ""It was just one of those games where once we all got in the groove we were like 'Hey, let's keep it riding, keep it rolling' and that's what we did."" This video can not be played 'Out of this world!' - Mahomes evades several tackles in dazzling run Quarterback Patrick Mahomes threw three touchdowns and ran in another as the Chiefs overcame an early 10-point deficit with 28 unanswered points to beat the Titans. Tennessee had previously upset New England and Baltimore in the play-offs. Kansas City were slow starters again, just like last week when they fell 24-0 behind beforebeating Houston 51-31,and they twice went 10 points behind in a near perfectly executed game plan from the Titans, combined with more sloppy play and penalties from the hosts. Tyreek Hill scored on an eight-yard jet sweep either side of a Derrick Henry run and a touchdown catch from Titans lineman Dennis Kelly - who became the heaviest player ever to catch a play-off touchdown pass in history. Mahomes then took over with two quick scores that have become his trademark - first firing a 20-yard strike to Hill before taking off himself for a breath-taking 27-yard  scoring run that saw him evade a couple of tacklers before out-muscling a couple more and driving into the end zone. The Titans had dominated first-half possession and Kansas City had made the very most of their time with the ball, but in the second half Kansas City produced more prolonged attacks as they chewed up over seven minutes when scoring their fourth touchdown of the game. Damien Williams ran in the score from three yards out to cap a 13-play drive covering 73 yards. Far from sitting on their lead, Kansas City kept pressing and Mahomes unleashed a 60-yard throw to Sammy Watkins to seal the game, despite a late consolation touchdown from Anthony Firkser. After the Chiefs fell at the same hurdle at home last season against the Patriots, this time they saw out the contest to claim the AFC Championship title and book their place in Miami for Super Bowl 54 on 2 February. Kansas City appeared in the first ever Super Bowl and last took part in the big game in Super Bowl IV in 1970 - with their return to the NFL finale representing the biggest gap in Super Bowl appearances in history. ""It's amazing and to do it at Arrowhead as well,"" said Mahomes. ""We're not done yet, we're going to do it. This is awesome, we go out every day and you see the work coach [Andy] Reid does.

"The dealer arranged to meet our undercover reporter in Linthorpe Road Children as young as 14 can easily buy class A drugs using Snapchat, a BBC investigation has found. The social media app is being used by dealers across Teesside to advertise substances and arrange drug deals. The BBC's Inside Out used a 14-year-old decoy, whose profile clearly showed he was a schoolboy, who was able to buy two grams of MDMA. They were picked up by an undercover reporter. The deal was arranged in seconds and was delivered in minutes. Snapchat is a social media app that allows people to post photos and video, which then disappear once they have been read. Our reporter discovered a number of Snapchat accounts posting regular videos showing large amounts of cocaine, MDMA, ketamine and cannabis. The dealers try to entice new users by offering giveaways Dealers post videos that promote the drugs they have for sale, as well as sending daily offers and advertisements via private messaging. One dealer claimed to be giving away an ounce (28g) of MDMA in a raffle users could only enter if they promoted the dealer's account to two of their friends. This ""prize"" could have had a street value of up to Â£1,400. Users in Middlesbrough can buy drugs for as little as Â£10. Our reporter used Snapchat to buy cocaine in Dock Street in Middlesbrough and the MDMA was handed over in Linthorpe Road in the town during a two-week investigation. The reporter then used a Home Office-approved kit to check the drugs were real. Harry Shapiro, a drugs adviser, said: ""There's no way you can varnish the truth about this, the worst that can happen to young people who consume a two gram bag of MDMA is they run the risk of dying. It's as simple as that."" Carson Price, from Hengoed in south Wales, died last April after taking an ecstasy pill he bought on Snapchat. His mother Tatum Price said: ""I blame Snapchat. If they were unable to advertise on Snapchat Carson wouldn't have been able to get hold of those drugs. ""I shouldn't even know where my local cemetery is, let alone go and visit my 13-year-old child."" Carson Price was a ""quiet and naive"" child, his mother said The National Crime Agency said the issue was ""alarming"" and acknowledged it was a ""growing threat"". Esther Rantzen, founder of Childline, said the findings were ""shocking"". ""I would say to Snapchat it's quite clear that you created this service to provide entertainment and fun. ""You don't want to kill children but if it's misused that will be the effect, you've got to do something to protect children, to protect young people and stop this murderous trade,"" she said. Snapchat, which claims to reach more than 60% of 13-34 year-olds in the UK, said it worked with the relevant authorities to ensure it was a positive and safe environment. It added it encouraged users to report illegal activity on the platform.

"German Chancellor Angela Merkel welcomed Russian President Vladimir Putin and UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has said that major powers are ""fully committed"" to a peaceful resolution in Libya after a summit in Berlin. World leaders have pledged not to interfere in Libya's ongoing civil conflict, and have vowed to uphold a UN arms embargo. The conflict pits powerful General Khalifa Haftar against the UN-backed Government of National Accord (GNA). But although both Libyan warring sides were present, they did not meet. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the two sides were briefed and consulted by the other parties. Alongside Mrs Merkel, attendees included Russia's President Vladimir Putin, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, French President Emmanuel Macron and UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson. This video can not be played What's behind the fight for Libya? Before the meeting, Mr Johnson said the aim of the conference was to ""stop this jockeying for position"". ""The people of Libya have suffered enough,"" he said as he arrived on Sunday. ""It's time for the country to move forward."" Leaders from the EU, Russia and Turkey were among those who committed to an end to foreign intervention in Libya's war, and to uphold a UN arms embargo. After the conference, German leader Mrs Merkel stressed there was no military way to end the conflict,  ""only a political solution"". Who is Gen Khalifa Haftar? A migrant's tale: Jailed and ransomed in Libya Mr Guterres meanwhile said all the major powers present shared ""a strong commitment to stop"" any further escalation in the region. He did however say he was ""very worried"" about reports that forces loyal to Gen Hafter had closed several key ports and a major oil pipeline in the country. Tripoli-based Prime Minister Fayez al-Serraj (left) and General Khalifa Haftar did not meet face to face Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov also expressed concerns. He said afterwards the major powers ""have not yet succeeded in launching a serious and stable dialogue"" between the warring parties. And there were questions about whether there could be a lasting ceasefire, and how this could be maintained. Nevertheless, Mr Lavrov said both sides had taken ""a small step"" forward. A ceasefirestill looks far-fetched By Rana Jawad, BBC North Africa correspondent The commitment by foreign backers of the conflict - which include Russia, Egypt and Turkey - to respect the UN arms embargo on Libya will only be taken seriously if the UN Security Council acts on violations. This is something it has failed to do in years of conflict. For any progress to be made in the long term, Libya's warring sides will need to declare and commit to a ceasefire, which still looks far-fetched. If there is eventually a long-enough ceasefire in place, it would allow the UN to go back to the political drawing board, and design a fresh political process for the country. Europe is trying to jostle its way back into a complex scene, which it all but abandoned over the past year because of its own divisions over a solution. If nothing else, the Berlin summit may have enabled it  to elbow its way back into a position with more leverage over stabilising Libya. Libya has been wracked by conflict since the 2011 uprising which ousted long-time strongman Muammar Gaddafi. Gen Haftar's Libyan National Army (LNA) controls much of eastern Libya, and last April he launched an offensive against the country's rival Government of National Accord (GNA) in the capital, Tripoli. His forces have so far been unable to take the city, but earlier this month the LNAcaptured the country's third-biggest city, Sirte. According to the UN, the fighting has killed hundreds of people and displaced thousands more from their homes. A truce was announced earlier this month between Gen Haftar and the GNA, led by Prime Minister Fayez al-Serraj. But both sides blame each other for reported breaches of the agreement, andattempts to broker a lasting ceasefire broke down last week at a summit in Moscow.
