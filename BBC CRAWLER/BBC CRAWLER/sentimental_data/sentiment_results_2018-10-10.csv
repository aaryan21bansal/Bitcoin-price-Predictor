"Clockwise from top left: PC Keith Palmer, Aysha Frade, Leslie Rhodes, Andreea Cristea and Kurt Cochran all lost their lives The minister's bodyguard who shot Westminster attacker Khalid Masood broke down in court as he described fearing for his life. ""He was carrying two large knives... covered in blood. He was going to kill me,"" the close protection officer told an inquest, his voice wavering. Masood had ploughed through pedestrians on Westminster Bridge, killing four, and fatally stabbed PC Keith Palmer. He died after being shot in the Palace of Westminster on 22 March last year. Two close protection officers were granted anonymity at 52-year-old Masood's inquest. They gave evidence beneath the public gallery in the Old Bailey's Court One, with the media listening from another room. The bodyguard who fired the shots - known to the court as SA74 -  said he heard an ""explosion"" as Masood's car crashed. The officers moved towards the Carriage Gates, where PC Palmer had been stabbed, the court heard. Police officers and members of the public were ""frantically"" moving towards him ""trying to get away from something or someone"", said SA74. ""I was certain that something terrible was happening."" He described drawing his Glock pistol on seeing Masood running towards him, and shouting at the attacker to drop the knives, before firing three times. His colleague - known as SB73 - described to jurors how he risked his safety to handcuff the attacker as he lay dying. ""At that time he was still breathing. His chest was still rising and falling. He was going grey,"" he said. ""He basically stopped breathing, so I started CPR; chest compressions."" Jonathan Hough QC, for the coroner, asked: ""Is it right to say there was a risk given the circumstances he might have a bomb?"" The officer agreed. A police officer who was on duty as part of a palace search team at Westminster described joining the officer at the scene to find Masood with two gunshot wounds. ""I was unable to find his pulse and started CPR. I continued the mouth-to-mouth on the suspect,"" he said. The inquest heard he was joined by a doctor, and a defibrillator was called for after a first was found to be faulty. PC Dunmore added: ""He started to deteriorate. He started to go cold and clammy and unresponsive."" Paramedics arrived and Masood was taken to St Mary's Hospital, with CPR continuing in the ambulance, but he died as a result of damaged caused to his heart and lung by one of the bullets. Those killed in the attack were PC Palmer, 48, American tourist Kurt Cochran, 54, retired window cleaner Leslie Rhodes, 75, mother-of-two Aysha Frade, 44, and Romanian designer Andreea Cristea, 31. The coroner ruled last week that they were unlawfully killed.

"Companies may be forced to reveal their ethnicity pay gap under plans unveiled by the prime minister to help minorities at work. Theresa May has launched a consultation on whether mandatory reporting will help address disparities between the pay and career prospects of minorities. She acknowledged that minorities often ""feel like they are hitting a brick wall"" at work. The move follows the decision to make firms reveal their gender pay gaps. Downing Street said the consultation would allow businesses to share views on what information should be published ""to allow for decisive action to be taken"" while at the same time avoiding ""undue burdens on businesses"". It will run until January. The government's Race Disparity Audit last year showed widely varying outcomes in areas including education, employment, health and criminal justice between Britain's white and ethnic minority populations. It found that Asian, black and other ethnic groups were disproportionately likely to be on a low income, with just 1% of non-white police officers in senior roles. Within NHS England, it found that 18% of white job applicants shortlisted got the job, compared with 11% of ethnic minorities. Ethnic minority consultants 'paid less' Cambridge 'needs help' enrolling black students Should workers be asked what they earn? More firms 'should publish gender pay gap' Mrs May said: ""Our focus is now on making sure the UK's organisations, boardrooms and senior management teams are truly reflective of the workplaces they manage, and the measures we are taking today will help employers identify the actions needed to create a fairer and more diverse workforce."" Mrs May is also due to unveil a Race at Work Charter signed by firms including accountancy giant KPMG, advertising firm Saatchi & Saatchi, and public sector bodies including NHS England and the Civil Service. The charter, designed with Business in the Community, commits signatories to increasing recruitment and career progression of ethnic minority employees. The prime minister said: ""Every employee deserves the opportunity to progress and fulfil their potential in their chosen field, regardless of which background they are from, but too often ethnic minority employees feel they're hitting a brick wall when it comes to career progression."" The consultation was welcomed by the CBI employers' group. Matthew Fell, chief UK policy director, said: ""Transparency can be a catalyst for action in tackling the ethnicity pay gap, in the same way that it has been so successful for gender."" The Equality and Human Rights Commission also supported it, with its chairman David Isaac saying: ""Extending mandatory reporting beyond gender will... give employers the insight they need to identify and remove barriers to ethnic minority staff joining and progressing to the highest level in their organisations.""

"This video can not be played Strictly's Seann Walsh: 'We made a huge mistake' Comedian Seann Walsh has insisted he's ""not the person I'm being portrayed as"" after being caught kissing his Strictly Come Dancing dance partner Katya Jones. Theywere photographed together on a night out, leading Walsh's girlfriend to end their relationship. The pair apologised during an appearance on BBC Two's Strictly - It Takes Two on Wednesday. An emotional Walsh said: ""I made a mistake, which I'm very sorry for - sorry for the hurt that I've caused."" He and Jones, the winner of last year's Strictly, had previously apologised on Twitter after their public kiss came to light. The pair will perform a Charleston on Saturday Speaking on It Takes Two, Walsh said: ""You never think about the extent of the damage that you're going to do in a moment of... you know, the mistake that you've made. ""I'm not perfect, far from it. Our relationship wasn't perfect. That doesn't mean I wanted it to end the way it finally did, and I'm very sorry for that. ""I feel it's also important for me to say that the people that know me the most, that love me, they know that I am not the person I'm being portrayed as. I'm still sorry for what I did, but it's very important for me to get that out there."" Walsh's ex-girlfriend, actress Rebecca Humphries, has accused him of ""controlling"" behaviour.

"Increased production of fruit and vegetables will be needed if diets change If the world wants to limit climate change, water scarcity and pollution, then we all need to embrace ""flexitarian"" diets, say scientists. This means eating mainly plant-based foods, and is one of three key steps towards a sustainable future for all in 2050, they say. Food waste will need to be halved and farming practices will also have to improve,according to the study,external. Without action, the impacts of the food system could increase by up to 90%. Fast on the heels of the landmark report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) comes this new study on how food production and consumption impact major threats to the planet. Final call to halt 'climate catastrophe' Q&A: Climate change - your questions answered Five things we have learned from the IPCC report The authors say that the food system has a number of significant environmental impacts including being a major driver of climate change, depleting freshwater and pollution through excessive use of nitrogen and phosphorous. This video can not be played Dr Marco Springmann tells Today eating only one portion of red meat a week could help tackle global warming The study says that thanks to the population and income growth expected between 2010 and 2050, these impacts could grow between 50-90%. This could push our world beyond its planetary boundaries, which the authors say represent a ""safe operating space for humanity on a stable Earth system"". However the study finds that no single solution will avert the dangers, so a combined approach is needed. So when it comes to climate change, the authors looked at what they called a ""flexitarian diet"". ""We can eat a range of healthy diets but what they all have in common, according to the latest scientific evidence, is that they are all relatively plant based,"" said lead author Dr Marco Springmann from the University of Oxford. ""You can go from a diet that has small amounts of animal products, some might call it a Mediterranean based diet, we call it a flexitarian diet, over to a pescatarian, vegetarian or vegan diet - we tried to stay with the most conservative one of these which in our view is the flexitarian one, but even this has only one serving of red meat per week."" Improved farming techniques and reduced use of fertiliser will be required If the world moved to this type of diet, the study found that greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture would be reduced by more than half. But as well as altering diets, the research says that farming practices need to change significantly. This involves boosting yields from existing cropland, improving water management and restricting and recycling fertiliser use. ""We looked at improving agricultural yields in particular of more health sensitive crops like fruit, vegetables and legumes,"" said Dr Springmann. ""In the past there has been lots of invest in the stable grains like maize and corn, but now we really need to move it to the crops we need more of. We also looked at increasing the efficiency of water use, and we looked at better monitoring and recycling of fertiliser - lots of it is lost and it runs off into rivers and causes dead zones in the oceans."" In addition, the study found that halving the amount of food lost to waste would reduce the environmental impacts of agriculture by 16%. Cutting down on food waste will be key to reducing the environmental impacts of farming ""Tackling food loss and waste will require measures across the entire food chain, from storage, and transport, over food packaging and labelling to changes in legislation and business behaviour that promote zero-waste supply chains,"" said Fabrice de Clerck, director of science atEAT,externalwho funded the study. The key element is that these three solutions must be implemented together. ""Feeding a world population of 10 billion people is possible - yet only if we change the way we eat, and the way we produce food,"" said Johan RockstrÃ¶m, director designate of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, who is one of the authors of the study. ""All measures combined can result in keeping healthy both planet and people."" The study has been published in the journal Nature.

"This video can not be played Wendy Urquhart: 'There were dozens of cars in the ocean' Two British people have been confirmed dead after flash floods in Majorca. At least nine people in total are believed to have died after torrential rainstorms hit the area around Sant Llorenc des Cardassar on Tuesday night. The Britons, thought to be a couple,were reportedly in a taxi,externalwhen the deluge swept through. The Foreign Office said it was supporting their family and was ready to assist any other British people affected by the flooding. Weather forecasters reported that eight inches of rain fell in the area - 40 miles east of the capital of Palma on the Spanish island - in just four hours. Antonia Bauza, the deputy mayor of Sant Llorenc, told the Cadena SER radio station that two local people also died in the town, including an elderly woman found in the basement of her house. At least two others are known to have died in the nearby town of S'illot. More heavy rain was forecast on Wednesday Hundreds of residents have been forced to move to emergency shelters Witnesses described a torrent of water and mud that buried cars and tore down trees. ""It all happened in less than 10 minutes,"" one told Spanish TV. ""We had to swim to try to survive."" Hundreds of displaced residents are in emergency shelters, and about 80 soldiers were expected to join more than 100 rescuers who are working in the area.

"Zamira Hajiyeva: Centre of NCA investigation A woman who spent Â£16m at Harrods in a decade can now be identified as Zamira Hajiyeva - the first target for the UK's new anti-corruption law. Mrs Hajiyeva lost a legal battle to stay anonymous after the media argued the public should know the full facts. Originally from Azerbaijan, she is the wife of an ex-state banker. She risks losing her Â£15m home near the London store and a Berkshire golf course if she fails to explain the source of her wealth to the High Court. Under the terms of the UK's first ever Unexplained Wealth Order, Mrs Hajiyeva, 55, must now provide the National Crime Agency with a clear account of how she and her husband, Jahangir Hajiyev, could afford to buy their large home in the exclusive London neighbourhood of Knightsbridge. Mrs Hajiyeva's lawyers said the UWO ""does not and should not be taken to imply any wrongdoing"", by her or her husband. They have applied for permission to appeal against the order. A UWO is a new power which has been designed to target suspected corrupt foreign officials who have potentially laundered stolen money through the UK. Investigators from the National Crime Agency believe there are billions of pounds of dirty money invested in British property - but it is almost impossible to charge the owners with a crime or seize the assets because of a lack of evidence. The new Unexplained Wealth Orders are an attempt to force the owners to disclose their wealth. If a suspected corrupt foreign official, or their family, cannot show a legitimate source for their riches, then the National Crime Agency can apply to the High Court to seize the property. Zamira Hajiyeva once spent Â£150,000 in a single day in Harrods, west London Jahangir Hajiyev is the former chairman of the International Bank of Azerbaijan. He was jailed in 2016 for 15 years after being convicted of being part of a major fraud and embezzlement that saw tens of millions of pounds disappear from the bank. Judges also ordered him to repay $39m. Seven years earlier, a company based in the British Virgin Islands paid Â£11.5m for a large home, just minutes' walk from Harrods in west London. Its current market value is estimated at Â£15m. Jahangir Hajiyev - husband of Zamira Hajiyeva The High Court heard that the ultimate owners were Mrs Hajiyeva and her husband. In 2013, another company controlled by Mrs Hajiyeva spent more than Â£10m buying Mill Ride Golf Club in Berkshire, a plush course and estate near Ascot. The Home Office gave Mrs Hajiyeva permission to live in the UK under a visa scheme for wealthy investors. During a High Court hearing in July, in which the couple were known only as Mr and Mrs A, it was revealed that Mrs Hajiyeva had an enormous amount of disposable income. Over ten years she spent more than Â£16m in Harrods - the equivalent of more than Â£4,000 a day. Examples of her big spending, revealed to the court, included Â£150,000 spent on a single day on Boucheron - a luxury jewellery, perfume and watches brand. The next day, the court heard, she topped up the wine cellar by spending Â£1,800. On another occasion she spent Â£100,000 on Cartier jewellery and Â£20,000 on luxury men's goods. Mrs Hajiyeva used three store loyalty cards and 35 credit cards issued by her husband's bank. The couple's home in west London, a short walk from Harrods In a ruling upholding the Unexplained Wealth Order, Mr Justice Supperstone said: ""I agree with the NCA that this evidence is significant in the light of the reports of Mr A's trial that allegations made against him included abuse of his position at the Bank by issuing credit cards in the names of family members, through which large debts were run up against the Bank."" Official records reveal the couple also own two dedicated bays within the private Harrods car park and Mrs Hajiyeva also bought a $42m Gulfstream G550 jet. Duncan Hames, director of policy at Transparency International UK, said the pressure group was ""delighted"" at the use of the Unexplained Wealth Order. ""UWOs should now be used more widely to pursue more of the Â£4.4 billion worth of suspicious wealth we have identified across the UK,"" he said. No - she says she is innocent of the accusations and tried to challenge the Unexplained Wealth Order after it was imposed in February. Lawyers for Mrs Hajieyva told the High Court that she and her husband are suffering a massive injustice. ""The decision of the High Court upholding the grant of an Unexplained Wealth Order against Zamira Hajiyeva does not and should not be taken to imply any wrongdoing, whether on her part or that of her husband,"" they said in a statement. ""The NCA's case is that the UWO is part of an investigative process, not a criminal procedure, and it does not involve the finding of any criminal offence."" Jahangir Hajiyev denies defrauding his bank - but has unsuccessfully appealed against his conviction. His lawyers say that he fell out with Azerbaijan's corrupt ruling family and paid the price. He is asking the European Court of Human Rights to intervene in his case. During her unsuccessful challenge to the Unexplained Wealth Order, Mrs Hajiyeva said her husband was a legitimate businessman who had become independently wealthy thanks to a string of successful businesses, before becoming a chairman at the bank. But the National Crime Agency told the court that Mr Hajiyev had been a state employee between 1993 and 2015 - and as an official he would not have had the means to amass the wealth investigators have traced.

"Airbus made fuel system changes to its existing A350-900 aircraft to allow for an extended flight range - giving it the name A350-900 ULR (ultra long range) The world's longest commercial flight has left Singapore for New York, beginning a journey scheduled to cover more than 15,000km in almost 19 hours. Singapore Airlines is relaunching the service five years after it was cut because it had become too expensive. Flight SQ22 departed at 15:37GMT with 150 passengers and 17 crew. The inaugural flight from Changi Airport to Newark's international airport, which services New York, took off amid much fanfare. However, Singapore Airlines told passengers before take off that their flight to Newark, while still the world's longest flight by distance, could only take some 17 hours. Qantas launched a 17-hour non-stop service from Perth to London earlier this year, while Qatar runs a 17.5-hour service between Auckland and Doha. Singapore Airlines (SIA) said there was demand for customers for non-stop services which help cut travelling times compared with flights which have a stopover. Ahead of the take-off, the airline told the BBC that business class seats for the flight were fully booked, and there were ""a very limited number"" of premium economy seats left. The airline is not planning to offer any economy bookings on the route. A business class ticket will entitle passengers to two meals, and the choice of when they are served, plus refreshments in between. They will also have a bed to sleep in. Premium economy fares will get three meals at fixed times, with refreshments in between. The brand new Airbus plane that SIA is using has been configured to seat 161 passengers in all - 67 business passengers and 94 premium economy passengers. It's the world's longest non-stop flight... for now Jet makes history on flight from Australia ""The thinking behind that is that they are selling a premium product - it's for the top end of town,"" says aviation expert Geoffrey Thomas, who was booked on to Thursday's flight. ""This is a route between two massive financial hubs, and so they will fill this plane up with business people, or well-heeled travellers who want the convenience of a non stop flight. ""It's also been proven that when carriers introduce a new non-stop route, the traffic on that route increases threefold."" Mr Thomas, the editor-in-chief of airline rating site Airlineratings.com, has been on several such inaugural flights, including Qantas'new long-haul from Perth to London, inaugurated earlier this year. He said: ""The Qantas flight to London was a huge event.  We were basically on our feet for the entire flight, it was incredibly exciting. There's almost a party atmosphere on board."" Qantas is using a 787-9 Dreamliner for its Perth to London route Qantas meanwhile is in advanced discussions with Airbus and Boeing over an aircraft capable of making a 20-hour flight between London and Sydney. The Australian national flag carrier also plans to fly non-stop from Australia to North America - slightly shorter than the London-Sydney non-stop flight. But Max Kingsley-Jones, group editor of Flight Global, warned that plans for new non-stop routes had a habit of changing in line with the economics of the world. ""In the boom times you get a lot of what we call direct-connect flights between smaller citiesâ¦ [then] each time there's a downturn you see all those tail off, and then we go back to people flying over hubs,"" he told the BBC's Today programme. ""Even though it costs more for an airline to fly over a hub, they'll always charge you less because of the disadvantage of going via somewhere else."" Of two possible routes that SIA could take to Newark, SIA has told passengers it will take the North Pacific route. Mr Thomas says it will cover a distance of some 15,341km, but reminds non-aviation experts that while the distance between destinations remains constant, the distance flown and flight times can vary because of tailwinds, headwinds and any need for weather-related diversions. Do 'longest flight' records matter? How UK-Australia travel evolved to one flight Can long-haul air travel also be low cost? ""When you've got some good strong jet streams going in an easterly direction, which is the way we'll go, then we will fly over Japan, then over the North Pacific, possibly touching into Alaska, then down through Canada into Newark."" Business class seating on Singapore Airline's new A350-900 ULR - the flight will not offer any economy seating The A350-900 ULR (ultra-long-range) that set off on Thursday from Singapore to Newark belongs to Airbus' family of long-range, twin-engine aircraft. The planes have been designed to replace Boeing's older 777 series and use between 20% and 30% less fuel than the 777s did - which is a good thing amid rising oil prices. Singapore Airlines launched the same non-stop route between Changi and Newark in 2004, but by 2013 the carrier was forced to cancel it. The A340-500 it was using at the time used a lot of fuel and eventually the route became too expensive to run. Several carriers already use the newer A350-900s on their long-haul routes. They have higher ceilings, larger windows and lighting designed to reduce jetlag - all good things for busy business travellers. But the ultra-long-range version that SIA has bought from Airbus has the longest capability of any aircraft flying today, thanks in part to a slightly modified fuel system. It can fly for 20 hours non-stop, which most aviation experts will tell you is the future of very long-haul travel for business and pleasure.

"DUP leader Arlene Foster met EU negotiator Michel Barnier on Tuesday The Democratic Unionist Party's 10 Westminster MPs are planning to vote down the Budget later this month if they are unhappy about the government's Brexit plans, the BBC understands. Theresa May relies on DUP support in key votes because she does not have a majority in the House of Commons. But the DUP could abandon this deal if Brexit means new barriers between Northern Ireland and Great Britain, Newsnight's Nick Watt said. The Budget takes place on 29 October. If the DUP voted against it the government would face possible defeat, which could lead to a no-confidence vote. Earlier it abstained - rather than backing the government - in a vote on the Agriculture Bill in what a DUP source said was a ""warning shot"". Brexit negotiators working 'day and night' Prime Minister's Questions: The verdict Reality Check- Red lines on the Irish border The UK and the EU have yet to strike a deal on how Brexit will work, with less than six months to go before the UK leaves on 29 March. One of the key things they have not yet agreed is how to prevent there being new border checks between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, which is a member of the EU. There have been warnings that a new ""hard border"" will damage businesses and undermine peace in Northern Ireland. The DUP has dismissed the warnings about the peace process. It says it will not tolerate the EU's suggestion of Northern Ireland staying in line with EU customs rules to enable trade to flow freely across the border. Allow Twitter content?

Mrs May has also rejected this proposal, saying it would undermine the integrity of the UK. Visiting the European Parliament, DUP leader Arlene Foster refused to say whether her MPs would vote against the Budget after being asked several times by reporters. She reiterated that she would not accept any new barriers to trade going in either direction between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier, meanwhile, said there would have to be new checks on goods travelling between the EU and the UK because of the UK's decision to leave the EU's single market and customs union. The EU and UK have agreed that these checks ""cannot be performed at the border"" and the EU proposes to carry them out ""in the least intrusive way possible"", he said. ""Both the EU and UK exclude having a physical border on the island of Ireland,"" he said. ""Therefore, what will arrive into Northern Ireland will also be arriving in our single market. ""There will be administrative procedures that do not exist today for goods travelling to Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK. Our challenge is to make sure those procedures are as easy as possible and not too burdensome, in particular for smaller businesses. ""I understand why such procedures are politically sensitive but... Brexit was not our choice, it is the choice of the UK. Our proposal tries to help the UK in managing the negative fallout of Brexit in Northern Ireland in a way that respects the territorial integrity of the UK."" He said that under the EU's proposed ""backstop"" to prevent a hard border, companies in the rest of the UK sending goods to Northern Ireland would fill out customs declarations online in advance. ""The only visible systematic checks between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK would involve scanning the bar codes on lorries and containers, which could be done on ferries and at transit ports,"" he said. While regulatory checks on industrial goods could be done at company premises, checks on live animals and animal products had to happen at the border, he said, which would mean a ""significant increase in terms of scale"" to existing checks. Newsnight political editor Nick Watt Losing a budget vote has traditionally been seen as a withdrawal of confidence in the government. One former Tory cabinet minister told Newsnight: ""The DUP should be putting the fear of God into Downing St."" The DUP is growing alarmed because it fears Downing St is edging towards a deal with the EU that may lead to additional regulatory checks on goods travelling between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Michel Barnier, the EU's chief negotiator, has called for such checks to avoid creating a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic. This would be achieved by aligning Northern Ireland with the rules of the single market. The prime minister has strongly rejected the Barnier plan. But senior DUP sources fear that Downing Street may agree to some form of regulatory checks. One DUP source told Newsnight: ""If we are not happy with what happens next week [in Brussels] we won't be bounced into anything. If she doesn't take our concerns on board, we will take the view that Theresa May is not the leader to take us through to a safe Brexit."" Read Nick's blog On Twitter former foreign secretary Boris Johnson, one of the leading critics of Theresa May's Brexit strategy, responded to reports of a new ""backstop"" arrangement being negotiated between the UK and the EU. It would make the UK ""a permanent EU colony"" with ""no right to escape"" from the EU's single market and customs union, he claimed. Allow Twitter content?

But Mel Stride, the financial secretary to the Treasury, told the BBC the government had a ""very strong position"" that there would be ""no border down the Irish Sea"". He predicted the UK was heading for a deal with the EU and would be keeping the DUP ""on board"". ""There is no difference between our position on the substantive issue,"" he added.

"More and more youngsters under the age of 21 are falling victim to money scams, according to the anti-fraud organisation Cifas. In the first nine months of the year, it said, 3,527 young people had experienced identity fraud, an increase of 24% on 2017. Most of the cases involved debit, credit and store cards. They include instances where criminals have applied to banks to get the cards issued in false names. 'I was a teenage money mule' 'Sharenting' is a risk to young people ""Our new figures are alarming to say the least,"" said Mike Haley, the chief executive officer of Cifas. ""For all of us, as parents, teachers, and responsible citizens, we have a duty to ensure we're taking every opportunity to educate young people on the dangers of becoming a fraud victim - and equally, a perpetrator of fraud."" In most cases, the banks usually accept liability where individuals have not been negligent. The Cifas figures also indicate a rise in the number of youngsters becoming so-called money mules. In the first nine months of 2018, as many as 9,636 people under the age of 21 agreed that criminals could use their bank account to launder cash. That was a 26% increase on the same period in 2017. Sometimes the young people are told to move the money electronically, and sometimes they are asked to withdraw cash before passing it on in person. The offence can carry a prison sentence of up to 14 years. Alternatively, individuals can be denied the use of a bank account for up to six years. Cifas is now calling on the banks to do more to warn young people about the dangers of such fraud.

"Adam Thomas and Claudia Patatas gave their child the middle name Adolf, a court has heard An alleged far-right terrorist who named his child after Hitler posed with the newborn while clad in the white robes of the Ku Klux Klan (KKK), a court heard. Prosecutors say Adam Thomas, 22, and Claudia Patatas, 38, gave their baby the middle name Adolf in honour of the Nazi leader. The pair are charged alongside Daniel Bogunovic, 27, with being members of banned neo-Nazi group National Action All three deny being in the group. Jurors at Birmingham Crown Court previously heard Ms Patatas and Mr Thomas' child - who was given the middle name Adolf - appeared in a picture alongside ""vehement racist"" Darren Fletcher. On the second day of the trial, the court was shown a picture of a man in hooded white robes cradling a baby. Barnaby Jameson QC, prosecuting, said: ""The suggestion is that is Mr Thomas and his child, whose middle name is Adolf."" He said another image from the ""Thomas-Patatas family album"" showed the defendant, again wearing the signature uniform of the white supremacist US group, brandishing a machete in front of a Confederate flag. It was shown hanging over a sofa, next to two cushions emblazoned with the Swastika. Mr Jameson said the couple also had a poster stuck to their fridge reading ""Britain is ours - the rest must go"". Jurors were also told Ms Patatas, of Banbury, sent a WhatsApp message to convicted National Action member Fletcher, declaring: ""All Jews must be put to death"". Outlining further mobile phone evidence, Mr Jameson read a message apparently sent from Thomas to Patatas in September 2017. In it, he used racial slurs to to describe black and Asian colleagues, describing one as ""half-bred"" and one as a ""mongrel"". ""What I've found is that all non-whites are intolerable but the ones who have lived here most of their lives are even worse,"" the court heard. ""They have a more thuggery attitude about them as opposed to the sterotypical childish African."" Ms Patatas sent offensive messages on WhatsApp, the court heard An inspection of the defendants' mobile devices also found Ms Patatas had a photograph of National Action co-founder Benjamin Raymond stored on hers, Mr Jameson said. Mr Thomas, meanwhile, had an image depicting the ""burning cross symbol of the KKK"", he said. The prosecutor also alleged Mr Bogunovic's phone contained an image of a March 2017 press report detailing how National Action was secretly reforming. Mr Jameson said the group had tried to ""shed one skin for another"" in order to evade the law, and questioned whether Mr Bogunovic's interest in the relaunch stemmed from his heavy involvement in it. Jurors were also told the defendants formed a new group named the TripleK Mafia - a reference to the KKK - after National Action was banned in 2016. However, it was repeatedly misspelt ""TrippleK"" on posters by fellow member Joel Wilmore, Mr Jameson said. The prosecutor then showed jurors an example of the typographical error. Wilmore, 24, of Bramhall Moor Lane, Stockport, has since admitted terrorist group membership. Opening the case on Tuesday, Mr Jameson said it detailed a ""cult of violent white racial supremacy"" which regarded groups including black, Jewish, Asian and gay people as ""sub-human"". ""It is a terror that can be summarised in two words: white Jihad - in other words, a white holy war,"" he said. Ms Patatas and Mr Thomas, both of Waltham Gardens, Banbury, and Bogunovic, of Crowns Hills Rise, Leicester deny being members of a banned group. Mr Thomas further denies a separate charge of having a copy of terrorist document, The Anarchist Cookbook, which contained bomb-making instructions. The trial continues.

"Womxn - to the untrained eye it may look like a typo. But when the Wellcome Collection - a museum and library in London - sent a tweet promoting an event using the word it led to a Twitter backlash from hundreds of women, and an apology from the organisation.

Like women, womxn refers to females, but it is an attempt to get away from patriarchal language. Dr Clara Bradbury-Rance, fellow at King's College London, said the spelling ""stems from a longstanding objection to the word woman as it comes from man, and the linguistic roots of the word mean that it really does come from the word man"". The word is also supposed to be inclusive of trans women, and some non-binary people. But how is it pronounced? ""I've heard womxn pronounced in lots of different ways. I've heard some pronounce it 'wo-minx',"" Dr Bradbury-Rance says. The museum was promoting a four-day event called Daylighting, which featured women's writing, art and ideas. In a tweet, the museum said it was using the spelling womxn because ""we feel that it is important to create a space/venue that includes diverse perspectives"". Allow Twitter content?

"This video can not be played Devastation as Michael makes landfall Hurricane Michael - a category four storm with winds reaching 155mph (250km/h) - has made landfall in Florida's north-west Panhandle region. According to the National Hurricane Center, the eye of the storm touched land near Mexico Beach, Florida, on Wednesday afternoon. Hundreds of thousands were told to evacuate but many have not fled. Florida Governor Rick Scott warned of ""unimaginable devastation"", saying it would be the worst storm in 100 years. How to survive a monster storm Are hurricanes getting worse? At least 13 people reportedly died in Central America over the weekend as a result of storm rains and floods. According to the Associated Press, six people were killed in Honduras, four in Nicaragua and three in El Salvador. Michael is expected to move quickly up the US East Coast, dumping rains on regions that are already saturated from Hurricane Florence last month. In their latest advisory, the National Hurricane Center warned coastal residents ""not to venture out into the relative calm of the eye, as hazardous winds will increase very quickly as the eye passes"". This video can not be played Hurricane Michael strikes Florida More than 370,000 people in Florida have been ordered to evacuate and move to higher ground, but officials estimate that far fewer have actually left.

A guide to the world's deadliest storms On the Saffir-Simpson hurricane scale, category four includes winds of up to 156mph with possible severe damage to even well-built homes and trees being felled. A guide to the world's deadliest storms  Hurricanes are violent storms that can bring devastation to coastal areas, threatening lives, homes and businesses. Hurricanes develop from thunderstorms, fuelled by warm, moist air as they cross sub-tropical waters.Warm air rises into the storm. Air swirls in to fill the low pressure in the storm, sucking air in and upwards, reinforcing the low pressure. The storm rotates due to the spin of the earth and energy from the warm ocean increases wind speeds as it builds. When winds reach 119km/h (74mph), it is known as a hurricane - in the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific - or a typhoon in the Western Pacific. ""Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face. Well, we're about to get punched in the face.""Florida Mayor Bob Buckhorn, ahead of Hurricane Irma (2017)  The central eye of calmer weather is surrounded by a wall of rainstorms.This eyewall has the fastest winds below it and violent currents of air rising through it.

More than 300 miles of coastline are currently under threat, the National Weather Service has said. Forecasters in Alabama have warned of possible tornados. By BBC's Gary O'Donoghue in Florida Driving through the streets of Panama City Beach this morning, there were almost no other cars on the road. Here and there the odd neon sign still glowed, but many houses and businesses were boarded up after an emergency evacuation order. Not everyone though had heeded the instruction. Dave Jackson, a man who remembers the devastation of Hurricane Andrew in southern Florida 26 years ago, has decided to stay, despite having a home just yards from the beach. His house, he says, is built to withstand winds of 150mph and it's just high enough above sea level that the predicted surge may well fall short. Just along the road, Stacey and Michael Buckner sit in their car, staring out to sea. Their house is two blocks from the water, and they've chosen not to leave because of Michael's elderly parents. For the coming hours, Dave, Michael and Stacey are on their own - the emergency services are staying out of the storm and nature is about to take its course. Communities along the Florida Panhandle will feel the brunt of the hurricane first, with Tallahassee and Panama City Beach forecast to get over 6in of rain and winds that could reach at least 100mph. Utility lines are expected to be damaged due to falling trees, leading to power outages. But by Thursday, the storm will move up the coast and skies will clear allowing for ""a massive wave of response and support"", said Gov Scott. Southern Georgia will be hit next, with residents there warned to brace for possible flash floods. Winds will die down as Michael pushes north into the soggy Carolinas with cities Columbia and Charlotte each forecasted to see up to 5in of rain. Local officials warn people in the regions affected by Hurricane Florence last month - even those living far from waterways - to watch for landslides or flash flooding.

"This video can not be played Aerial footage shows the destruction in Mexico Beach, Florida One of the strongest storms in recorded history to hit the US has battered north-west Florida, flooding homes, washing out beaches and snapping trees. Rescue services are beginning to assess the full impact of Hurricane Michael, which made landfall on Wednesday afternoon as a category four storm with 155mph (250km/h) winds. At least six people have been killed, most of them in Florida. Having weakened to a tropical storm, Michael has been hitting the Carolinas. In pictures: Hurricane Michael hits Florida How to survive a monster storm Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external. Storm-surge warnings are still in place, the US National Hurricane Center says, and residents across the southern US have been warned of the continuing danger from downed powerlines, flash floods and landslides. This video can not be played Storm Michael's trail of devastation There are fears for people who ignored evacuation warnings in some of the areas now flooded. Hundreds of thousands of homes and businesses were left without electricity in Florida, Alabama and Georgia. Debris in Panama City, Florida Michael made landfall near Mexico Beach, Florida, at around 14:00 (18:00 GMT) on Wednesday. It ranks among the most powerful hurricanes to hit the US in terms of wind speed and barometric pressure, comparable to Hurricane Andrew in 1992. Trailer homes were ravaged in Panama City, Florida Michael was so strong as it swept into Florida that it remained a hurricane for hours as it moved further inland, before being downgraded to a tropical storm. Its rapid intensification caught many by surprise, although the storm later weakened. Are hurricanes getting worse? A guide to the world's deadliest storms Unusually warm waters in the Gulf of Mexico turbo-charged the storm from a tropical depression on Sunday. This video can not be played Hurricane Michael strikes Florida On Tuesday it was still a category two hurricane but by Wednesday morning it had reached borderline category five, the highest level. Florida officials say at least four people died as a result of the storm in Gadsden County. In Seminole County, Georgia, a metal car-shelter lifted by a gust of wind hit a mobile home, killing a girl of 11. And a man died when a tree fell on his car near Charlotte, North Carolina on Thursday. Michael earlier reportedly killed at least 13 people as it passed through Central America: six in Honduras, four in Nicaragua and three in El Salvador. The storm has knocked out power to more than 900,000 homes and businesses. More than 370,000 people in Florida were ordered to evacuate but officials believe many ignored the warning. The coastal city of Apalachicola reported a storm surge of nearly 8ft (2.5m). This McDonald's sign was twisted by the storm in Panama City Beach ""There are so many downed power lines and trees that it's almost impossible to get through the city,"" local mayor Van Johnson was quoted as saying by Reuters news agency. Florida Governor Rick Scott said the US Coast Guard had carried out 10 missions overnight, saving at least 27 people. ""So many lives have been changed forever,"" he told reporters. ""So many families have lost everything. This hurricane was an absolute monster."" Images from Mexico Beach show many homes submerged in water, and there was severe damage to buildings in the state's Panama City area.

This video can not be played Hurricane Michael as seen from space A guide to the world's deadliest storms  Hurricanes are violent storms that can bring devastation to coastal areas, threatening lives, homes and businesses. Hurricanes develop from thunderstorms, fuelled by warm, moist air as they cross sub-tropical waters.Warm air rises into the storm. Air swirls in to fill the low pressure in the storm, sucking air in and upwards, reinforcing the low pressure. The storm rotates due to the spin of the earth and energy from the warm ocean increases wind speeds as it builds. When winds reach 119km/h (74mph), it is known as a hurricane - in the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific - or a typhoon in the Western Pacific. ""Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face.

"Zamira Hajiyeva: Centre of NCA investigation A woman who spent Â£16m at Harrods in a decade can now be identified as Zamira Hajiyeva - the first target for the UK's new anti-corruption law. Mrs Hajiyeva lost a legal battle to stay anonymous after the media argued the public should know the full facts. Originally from Azerbaijan, she is the wife of an ex-state banker. She risks losing her Â£15m home near the London store and a Berkshire golf course if she fails to explain the source of her wealth to the High Court. Under the terms of the UK's first ever Unexplained Wealth Order, Mrs Hajiyeva, 55, must now provide the National Crime Agency with a clear account of how she and her husband, Jahangir Hajiyev, could afford to buy their large home in the exclusive London neighbourhood of Knightsbridge. Mrs Hajiyeva's lawyers said the UWO ""does not and should not be taken to imply any wrongdoing"", by her or her husband. They have applied for permission to appeal against the order. A UWO is a new power which has been designed to target suspected corrupt foreign officials who have potentially laundered stolen money through the UK. Investigators from the National Crime Agency believe there are billions of pounds of dirty money invested in British property - but it is almost impossible to charge the owners with a crime or seize the assets because of a lack of evidence. The new Unexplained Wealth Orders are an attempt to force the owners to disclose their wealth. If a suspected corrupt foreign official, or their family, cannot show a legitimate source for their riches, then the National Crime Agency can apply to the High Court to seize the property. Zamira Hajiyeva once spent Â£150,000 in a single day in Harrods, west London Jahangir Hajiyev is the former chairman of the International Bank of Azerbaijan. He was jailed in 2016 for 15 years after being convicted of being part of a major fraud and embezzlement that saw tens of millions of pounds disappear from the bank. Judges also ordered him to repay $39m. Seven years earlier, a company based in the British Virgin Islands paid Â£11.5m for a large home, just minutes' walk from Harrods in west London. Its current market value is estimated at Â£15m. Jahangir Hajiyev - husband of Zamira Hajiyeva The High Court heard that the ultimate owners were Mrs Hajiyeva and her husband. In 2013, another company controlled by Mrs Hajiyeva spent more than Â£10m buying Mill Ride Golf Club in Berkshire, a plush course and estate near Ascot. The Home Office gave Mrs Hajiyeva permission to live in the UK under a visa scheme for wealthy investors. During a High Court hearing in July, in which the couple were known only as Mr and Mrs A, it was revealed that Mrs Hajiyeva had an enormous amount of disposable income. Over ten years she spent more than Â£16m in Harrods - the equivalent of more than Â£4,000 a day. Examples of her big spending, revealed to the court, included Â£150,000 spent on a single day on Boucheron - a luxury jewellery, perfume and watches brand. The next day, the court heard, she topped up the wine cellar by spending Â£1,800. On another occasion she spent Â£100,000 on Cartier jewellery and Â£20,000 on luxury men's goods. Mrs Hajiyeva used three store loyalty cards and 35 credit cards issued by her husband's bank. The couple's home in west London, a short walk from Harrods In a ruling upholding the Unexplained Wealth Order, Mr Justice Supperstone said: ""I agree with the NCA that this evidence is significant in the light of the reports of Mr A's trial that allegations made against him included abuse of his position at the Bank by issuing credit cards in the names of family members, through which large debts were run up against the Bank."" Official records reveal the couple also own two dedicated bays within the private Harrods car park and Mrs Hajiyeva also bought a $42m Gulfstream G550 jet. Duncan Hames, director of policy at Transparency International UK, said the pressure group was ""delighted"" at the use of the Unexplained Wealth Order. ""UWOs should now be used more widely to pursue more of the Â£4.4 billion worth of suspicious wealth we have identified across the UK,"" he said. No - she says she is innocent of the accusations and tried to challenge the Unexplained Wealth Order after it was imposed in February. Lawyers for Mrs Hajieyva told the High Court that she and her husband are suffering a massive injustice. ""The decision of the High Court upholding the grant of an Unexplained Wealth Order against Zamira Hajiyeva does not and should not be taken to imply any wrongdoing, whether on her part or that of her husband,"" they said in a statement. ""The NCA's case is that the UWO is part of an investigative process, not a criminal procedure, and it does not involve the finding of any criminal offence."" Jahangir Hajiyev denies defrauding his bank - but has unsuccessfully appealed against his conviction. His lawyers say that he fell out with Azerbaijan's corrupt ruling family and paid the price. He is asking the European Court of Human Rights to intervene in his case. During her unsuccessful challenge to the Unexplained Wealth Order, Mrs Hajiyeva said her husband was a legitimate businessman who had become independently wealthy thanks to a string of successful businesses, before becoming a chairman at the bank. But the National Crime Agency told the court that Mr Hajiyev had been a state employee between 1993 and 2015 - and as an official he would not have had the means to amass the wealth investigators have traced.

"Cristiano Ronaldo joined Juventus from Real Madrid in the summer Documents concerning rape allegations made against Cristiano Ronaldo have been ""completely fabricated"", according to the player's lawyer. Ronaldo, 33, denies assaulting Kathryn Mayorga at a Las Vegas hotel in 2009. Mayorga says she was attacked by the Portuguese footballer in a hotel room in the US city that year. A statement from Ronaldo's lawyer Peter Christiansen reiterated the Juventus forward ""vehemently denies all accusations in this civil action"". Ronaldo previously dismissed the claim, first reported in Germany's Der Spiegel, as ""fake news"" and his representatives said he would take legal action against the weekly magazine. Christiansen said a ""media outlet irresponsibly"" based its reports on ""stolen and easily manipulated digital documents"" of which ""significant parts were altered and/or completely fabricated"". Der Spiegel said Mayorga, 34, filed a report with Las Vegas police shortly after the alleged incident. In 2010, she reportedly reached an out-of-court settlement with Ronaldo involving a $375,000 (Â£288,000) payment for agreeing never to go public with the allegations. Christiansen says in a statement his client's position continues to be that ""what happened in 2009 in Las Vegas was completely consensual"". The lawyer says Ronaldo does not deny that he agreed to enter into an agreement, but ""the reasons that led him to do so are at least to be distorted"". The statement added: ""This agreement is by no means a confession of guilt. ""What happened was simply that Cristiano Ronaldo merely followed the advice of his advisors in order to put an end to the outrageous accusations made against him, in order precisely to avoid attempts, such as those we are now witnessing, to destroy a reputation built thanks to hard work, athletic ability and behavioural correction. ""Unfortunately, it is now involved in the type of litigation that is very common in the United States."" Christiansen added: ""Although Cristiano Ronaldo is accustomed to media attention, inherent in the fact that he is a famous person, it is absolutely deplorable that the media continue to propagate and stimulate an intentional defamation campaign based on stolen and easily manipulated digital documents. ""Cristiano Ronaldo has mandated his lawyers in the United States and Europe to deal with all legal aspects and expresses full confidence that the truth will prevail, despite the corruption of counter-information, and in which the laws of Nevada will be enforced and respected."" The statement also claims documents allegedly containing statements by Ronaldo are ""pure inventions"". He added: ""So that there are no doubts: Cristiano Ronaldo vehemently denies all the accusations in this civil action, in consistency with what he has done in the last nine years. ""The documents that allegedly contain statements by Mr Ronaldo and were reproduced in the media are pure inventions. ""By 2015, dozens of entities (including law firms) in different parts of Europe were attacked and their electronic data stolen by a cyber criminal. ""This hacker tried to sell such information, and a media outlet irresponsibly ended up publishing some of the stolen documents, significant parts of which were altered and/or completely fabricated. ""Once again, for the avoidance of doubt, Cristiano Ronaldo's position has always been, and continues to be, that what happened in 2009 in Las Vegas was completely consensual.""

"This video can not be played Devastation as Michael makes landfall Hurricane Michael - a category four storm with winds reaching 155mph (250km/h) - has made landfall in Florida's north-west Panhandle region. According to the National Hurricane Center, the eye of the storm touched land near Mexico Beach, Florida, on Wednesday afternoon. Hundreds of thousands were told to evacuate but many have not fled. Florida Governor Rick Scott warned of ""unimaginable devastation"", saying it would be the worst storm in 100 years. How to survive a monster storm Are hurricanes getting worse? At least 13 people reportedly died in Central America over the weekend as a result of storm rains and floods.

A guide to the world's deadliest storms  Hurricanes are violent storms that can bring devastation to coastal areas, threatening lives, homes and businesses. Hurricanes develop from thunderstorms, fuelled by warm, moist air as they cross sub-tropical waters.Warm air rises into the storm. Air swirls in to fill the low pressure in the storm, sucking air in and upwards, reinforcing the low pressure. The storm rotates due to the spin of the earth and energy from the warm ocean increases wind speeds as it builds. When winds reach 119km/h (74mph), it is known as a hurricane - in the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific - or a typhoon in the Western Pacific. ""Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face.

"Clockwise from top left: PC Keith Palmer, Aysha Frade, Leslie Rhodes, Andreea Cristea and Kurt Cochran all lost their lives The minister's bodyguard who shot Westminster attacker Khalid Masood broke down in court as he described fearing for his life. ""He was carrying two large knives... covered in blood. He was going to kill me,"" the close protection officer told an inquest, his voice wavering. Masood had ploughed through pedestrians on Westminster Bridge, killing four, and fatally stabbed PC Keith Palmer. He died after being shot in the Palace of Westminster on 22 March last year. Two close protection officers were granted anonymity at 52-year-old Masood's inquest. They gave evidence beneath the public gallery in the Old Bailey's Court One, with the media listening from another room. The bodyguard who fired the shots - known to the court as SA74 -  said he heard an ""explosion"" as Masood's car crashed. The officers moved towards the Carriage Gates, where PC Palmer had been stabbed, the court heard. Police officers and members of the public were ""frantically"" moving towards him ""trying to get away from something or someone"", said SA74. ""I was certain that something terrible was happening."" He described drawing his Glock pistol on seeing Masood running towards him, and shouting at the attacker to drop the knives, before firing three times. His colleague - known as SB73 - described to jurors how he risked his safety to handcuff the attacker as he lay dying. ""At that time he was still breathing. His chest was still rising and falling. He was going grey,"" he said. ""He basically stopped breathing, so I started CPR; chest compressions."" Jonathan Hough QC, for the coroner, asked: ""Is it right to say there was a risk given the circumstances he might have a bomb?"" The officer agreed. A police officer who was on duty as part of a palace search team at Westminster described joining the officer at the scene to find Masood with two gunshot wounds. ""I was unable to find his pulse and started CPR. I continued the mouth-to-mouth on the suspect,"" he said. The inquest heard he was joined by a doctor, and a defibrillator was called for after a first was found to be faulty. PC Dunmore added: ""He started to deteriorate. He started to go cold and clammy and unresponsive."" Paramedics arrived and Masood was taken to St Mary's Hospital, with CPR continuing in the ambulance, but he died as a result of damaged caused to his heart and lung by one of the bullets. Those killed in the attack were PC Palmer, 48, American tourist Kurt Cochran, 54, retired window cleaner Leslie Rhodes, 75, mother-of-two Aysha Frade, 44, and Romanian designer Andreea Cristea, 31. The coroner ruled last week that they were unlawfully killed.

"Adam Thomas and Claudia Patatas gave their child the middle name Adolf, a court has heard An alleged far-right terrorist who named his child after Hitler posed with the newborn while clad in the white robes of the Ku Klux Klan (KKK), a court heard. Prosecutors say Adam Thomas, 22, and Claudia Patatas, 38, gave their baby the middle name Adolf in honour of the Nazi leader. The pair are charged alongside Daniel Bogunovic, 27, with being members of banned neo-Nazi group National Action All three deny being in the group. Jurors at Birmingham Crown Court previously heard Ms Patatas and Mr Thomas' child - who was given the middle name Adolf - appeared in a picture alongside ""vehement racist"" Darren Fletcher. On the second day of the trial, the court was shown a picture of a man in hooded white robes cradling a baby. Barnaby Jameson QC, prosecuting, said: ""The suggestion is that is Mr Thomas and his child, whose middle name is Adolf."" He said another image from the ""Thomas-Patatas family album"" showed the defendant, again wearing the signature uniform of the white supremacist US group, brandishing a machete in front of a Confederate flag. It was shown hanging over a sofa, next to two cushions emblazoned with the Swastika. Mr Jameson said the couple also had a poster stuck to their fridge reading ""Britain is ours - the rest must go"". Jurors were also told Ms Patatas, of Banbury, sent a WhatsApp message to convicted National Action member Fletcher, declaring: ""All Jews must be put to death"". Outlining further mobile phone evidence, Mr Jameson read a message apparently sent from Thomas to Patatas in September 2017. In it, he used racial slurs to to describe black and Asian colleagues, describing one as ""half-bred"" and one as a ""mongrel"". ""What I've found is that all non-whites are intolerable but the ones who have lived here most of their lives are even worse,"" the court heard. ""They have a more thuggery attitude about them as opposed to the sterotypical childish African."" Ms Patatas sent offensive messages on WhatsApp, the court heard An inspection of the defendants' mobile devices also found Ms Patatas had a photograph of National Action co-founder Benjamin Raymond stored on hers, Mr Jameson said. Mr Thomas, meanwhile, had an image depicting the ""burning cross symbol of the KKK"", he said. The prosecutor also alleged Mr Bogunovic's phone contained an image of a March 2017 press report detailing how National Action was secretly reforming. Mr Jameson said the group had tried to ""shed one skin for another"" in order to evade the law, and questioned whether Mr Bogunovic's interest in the relaunch stemmed from his heavy involvement in it. Jurors were also told the defendants formed a new group named the TripleK Mafia - a reference to the KKK - after National Action was banned in 2016. However, it was repeatedly misspelt ""TrippleK"" on posters by fellow member Joel Wilmore, Mr Jameson said. The prosecutor then showed jurors an example of the typographical error. Wilmore, 24, of Bramhall Moor Lane, Stockport, has since admitted terrorist group membership. Opening the case on Tuesday, Mr Jameson said it detailed a ""cult of violent white racial supremacy"" which regarded groups including black, Jewish, Asian and gay people as ""sub-human"". ""It is a terror that can be summarised in two words: white Jihad - in other words, a white holy war,"" he said. Ms Patatas and Mr Thomas, both of Waltham Gardens, Banbury, and Bogunovic, of Crowns Hills Rise, Leicester deny being members of a banned group. Mr Thomas further denies a separate charge of having a copy of terrorist document, The Anarchist Cookbook, which contained bomb-making instructions. The trial continues.

The hurricane made landfall at around 14:00 (18:00 GMT), according tothe Miami-based National Hurricane Center (NHC),external. The NHC warned of a life-threatening storm surge, hurricane force winds and heavy rainfall along the north-eastern Gulf coast. It said some regions of Florida may experience storm surges of up to 14ft (4m).

A guide to the world's deadliest storms On the Saffir-Simpson hurricane scale, category four includes winds of up to 156mph with possible severe damage to even well-built homes and trees being felled. A guide to the world's deadliest storms  Hurricanes are violent storms that can bring devastation to coastal areas, threatening lives, homes and businesses. Hurricanes develop from thunderstorms, fuelled by warm, moist air as they cross sub-tropical waters.Warm air rises into the storm. Air swirls in to fill the low pressure in the storm, sucking air in and upwards, reinforcing the low pressure. The storm rotates due to the spin of the earth and energy from the warm ocean increases wind speeds as it builds. When winds reach 119km/h (74mph), it is known as a hurricane - in the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific - or a typhoon in the Western Pacific. ""Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face. Well, we're about to get punched in the face.""Florida Mayor Bob Buckhorn, ahead of Hurricane Irma (2017)  The central eye of calmer weather is surrounded by a wall of rainstorms.This eyewall has the fastest winds below it and violent currents of air rising through it. A mound of water piles up below the eye which is unleashed as the storm reaches land.These storm surges can cause more damage from flooding than the winds. ""Urgent warning about the rapid rise of water on the SW FL coast with the passage of #Irma's eye. MOVE AWAY FROM THE WATER!""Tweet from the National Hurricane Center The size of hurricanes is mainly measured by the Saffir-Simpson scale - other scales are used in Asia Pacific and Australia.

This video can not be played Why do people ignore hurricane warnings? Heavy rains are forecast for the Carolinas, which were drenched by Hurricane Florence last month. North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper told residents: ""I know people are fatigued from Florence, but don't let this storm catch you with your guard down."" More than 300 miles of coastline are currently under threat, the National Weather Service has said. Forecasters in Alabama have warned of possible tornados. By BBC's Gary O'Donoghue in Florida Driving through the streets of Panama City Beach this morning, there were almost no other cars on the road. Here and there the odd neon sign still glowed, but many houses and businesses were boarded up after an emergency evacuation order. Not everyone though had heeded the instruction. Dave Jackson, a man who remembers the devastation of Hurricane Andrew in southern Florida 26 years ago, has decided to stay, despite having a home just yards from the beach. His house, he says, is built to withstand winds of 150mph and it's just high enough above sea level that the predicted surge may well fall short. Just along the road, Stacey and Michael Buckner sit in their car, staring out to sea. Their house is two blocks from the water, and they've chosen not to leave because of Michael's elderly parents. For the coming hours, Dave, Michael and Stacey are on their own - the emergency services are staying out of the storm and nature is about to take its course. Communities along the Florida Panhandle will feel the brunt of the hurricane first, with Tallahassee and Panama City Beach forecast to get over 6in of rain and winds that could reach at least 100mph. Utility lines are expected to be damaged due to falling trees, leading to power outages. But by Thursday, the storm will move up the coast and skies will clear allowing for ""a massive wave of response and support"", said Gov Scott. Southern Georgia will be hit next, with residents there warned to brace for possible flash floods. Winds will die down as Michael pushes north into the soggy Carolinas with cities Columbia and Charlotte each forecasted to see up to 5in of rain. Local officials warn people in the regions affected by Hurricane Florence last month - even those living far from waterways - to watch for landslides or flash flooding.

"'Always be alert in your surroundings, so don't use earphones or handheld devices' police advised women Women have been urged not to wear headphones or use mobile phones following a string of sexual assaults in north-west London. Is this a form of victim blaming or necessary advice in an imperfect world? There have been 10 sex attacks on lone women in Cricklewood since February. Policerevealed more details about the assaults on Tuesday, including the attacker's modus operandi. In most cases, which have taken place near Willesden Green Tube station, the man approached a lone woman, tried to chat to her, asked for a kiss or a hug and then sexually abused her. The Metropolitan Police arrested a man and later released him under investigation. But their safety advice to women provoked criticism. ""I would appeal to women in the local area to take care when they are walking, especially if they are alone,"" said Det Con Laura Avery. ""Always stick to well-lit streets. If possible, let someone know when you are coming home and the route you are taking and always be alert in your surroundings, so don't use earphones or handheld devices."" Practical, universal safety tips? Or an unfair onus on women to change their day-to-day, law-abiding, behaviour? Jessica Eaton said it was time to ""stop this victim blaming"" Jessica Eaton, who campaigns on behalf of the victims of sexual violence, called the advice ""ridiculous"" and ""useless"". ""No-one will talk about the most common denominator here,"" she said. ""Headphones don't rape women, nor do skirts, or dark streets, or clubs, or alcohol, or parties, or sleepovers, or school uniforms. ""Name the perpetrators. Name the problem. We can't help if we can't even name it."" She added there was a hypocrisy to the police's sexual assault message and that given out following other types of crime. ""When there is a terrorist attack, government, police and public figures say 'we will not change our way of life, we will not change our behaviours... we will carry on as normal because we deserve a safe society'. ""But when women are being raped and assaulted, government, police and public figures say 'women, change your behaviours... do something different'.  Why are women supposed to change their lives and their behaviours for sex offenders?"" Her sentiments were mirrored online in response to the BBC's story. Allow Twitter content?

""All of these things suggest that those choices were naive, foolish, dangerous, or incorrect in some way."" She added that such advice ""creates a culture of fear - and not just for women"". ""It means people fear going out alone in the dark, or wearing outfits society might deem 'provocative', or enjoying a drink on a night out,"" she said. ""I'm a grown woman, I shouldn't need a chaperone. Advice such as this polices the behaviour of innocent people, rather than the actions of criminals.""

"Turkish media outlets have published CCTV footage which they say shows evidence of a plot linked to missing Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi. It shows men said to be Saudi intelligence officers entering and leaving Turkey via Istanbul airport. Mr Khashoggi, a US resident and critic of the Saudi monarchy, entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on 2 October and has not been seen since. Turkish authorities say Mr Khashoggi was killed. Saudi Arabia denies this. On Wednesday US President Donald Trump said he wanted to ""get to the bottom"" of the case, adding: ""We cannot let this happen to reporters, to anybody."" He said the situation was ""serious"" and wished to invite Mr Khashoggi's fiancÃ©e, Hatice Cengiz, to the White House. Broadcast by Turkey's TRT World channel and apparently garnered from security cameras, the footage shows vehicles driving up to the consulate, including black vans thought to be central to inquiries. Groups of Saudi men are seen entering Turkey via Istanbul airport, checking in at hotels and later leaving the country. Turkish investigators are looking into two Saudi Gulfstream jets that landed at the airport on 2 October. The video shows aircraft waiting on the tarmac. What we know about missing Saudi journalist The journalist who vanished into a consulate Turkish press trace Khashoggi's last steps Saudi Arabia's missing princes Mr Khashoggi was visiting the consulate to finalise his divorce so he could marry Ms Cengiz. He is seen on the video entering the consulate. His fiancÃ©e waits outside. Diplomatic vehicles were seen entering the consulate and driving to the Saudi consul's residence shortly after Mr Khashoggi's arrival Turkey's Sabah newspaper reports that it has identified 15 members of an intelligence team it says was involved in the Saudi's disappearance. Among them was a forensics expert, it says. The BBC's Mark Lowen says one of the men was once posted to London. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Police are reported to be examining 150 security cameras as part of their investigation. Some local media have also been reporting that Mr Khashoggi may have been abducted rather than killed. Turkey says it will conduct a search of the Istanbul consulate, while Saudi Arabia's foreign ministry said the country was ""open to co-operation"" and a search of the building could go ahead. This video can not be played CCTV footage shows missing Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. Ankara is demanding that Saudi Arabia prove Mr Khashoggi left the building, while not providing definitive evidence to support the claim he was killed inside. A critic of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Mr Khashoggi was living in self-imposed exile in the US and writing opinion pieces for the Washington Post before his disappearance. A former editor of the al-Watan newspaper and a short-lived Saudi TV news channel, he was for years seen as close to the Saudi royal family. He served as an adviser to senior Saudi officials. This video can not be played Jamal Khashoggi: Saudi Arabia needs reform, but one-man rule is ""bad"" for the kingdom But after several of his friends were arrested, his column was cancelled by the al-Hayat newspaper and he was allegedly warned to stop tweeting, Mr Khashoggi left Saudi Arabia for the US. The UK's foreign secretary has told Saudi Arabia that Britain expects urgent answers over the disappearance of Mr Khashoggi. In a phone call to Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir, Jeremy Hunt warned that ""friendships depend on shared values"". US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called on Saudi Arabia to ""support a thorough investigation"" of his disappearance and ""to be transparent about the results"". UN experts have demanded a ""prompt independent and international investigation"" into his disappearance. Last week, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed told Bloomberg News that his government was ""very keen to know what happened to him"", and that Mr Khashoggi had left ""after a few minutes or one hour"". Crown Prince Mohammed's brother and the Saudi ambassador to the US, Prince Khaled bin Salman al-Saud, has insisted all the reports about his disappearance or death ""are completely false and baseless"". Campaign group Reporters without Borders has called for an independent international investigation into Mr Khashoggi's disappearance. The group says more than 15 journalists and bloggers have been arrested in Saudi Arabia since September 2017. Hatice Cengiz has appealed to the US for help,externalin an emotional article in the Washington Post. ""I implore President Trump and First Lady Melania Trump to help shed light on Jamal's disappearance,"" she wrote. ""We were in the middle of making wedding plans, life plans,"" when he vanished, she said.

"The BBC News at Six looked a little different on Wednesday The BBC had to replace live broadcasts with recorded material on its TV news channels for about an hour on Wednesday following a technical glitch. The News at Six and News at Ten were also presented from the BBC's Millbank studio instead of the usual facilities at New Broadcasting House. The issue affected OpenMedia, a new computer system rolled out across BBC News outlets over the past six months. OpenMedia supplier Annova has been helping to investigate the fault.

"The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) has banned three Nasty Gal television ads for using a model that appeared ""unhealthily underweight"". The ASA received 22 complaints from viewers, who challenged whether the ads were ""socially irresponsible"". The online fashion retailer said the model was a UK size 8, with a body mass index (BMI) of 18.8, within the healthy weight range. The ASA said the model's poses drew attention to her ""prominent"" ribcage. ""While the female model in the ads generally appeared to be in proportion, there were specific scenes which, because of her poses, drew attention to her slimness,"" said the ASAin its ruling,external. It pointed to a scene in the ads showing the model lying on a sun lounger stretching her arms, which ""emphasised their slimness and length"", as well as a scene where the model sprayed mist on herself, in which her ribcage was clearly visible. The ASA concluded: ""We considered that the model appeared unhealthily underweight in those scenes and concluded that the ads were therefore irresponsible."" Nasty Gal said: ""We want to do all we can to use our voice to promote body positivity and diversity.  We have worked with the model in this ad many times and she is represented by one of the world's leading agencies, whose key priority is the health of their models. ""Her athletic build is in accordance with the NHS guidelines for a healthy adult woman. However, upon receiving notice of the complaint from the ASA, the ad was immediately removed from air."" The model's ribcage could be seen prominently in some scenes in the Nasty Gal ads Over the last three years, concerted efforts have been made in the fashion industry to stop using underweight models. In April 2015,France passed a lawbanning the use of catwalk fashion models deemed to be excessively thin. Under the law, modelling agencies that employ models below a certain BMI level face fines or prison terms, while magazines can be fined if they do not state when photos have been retouched. Later that year, an ad by luxury fashion brand Yves Saint Laurent (YSL) that appeared in Elle UK magazinewas banned by the ASAfor featuring a photo of a woman whose rib cage was visible and appeared prominent. Luxury fashion retailer Gucci has also fallen afoul of the ASA. In 2016,the ASA banned a Gucci video adon the Times website for featuring a model who was deemed unhealthily thin and had a face that appeared ""gaunt"". And in April this year, online fashion retailer Motel Rocks was made to remove five online ads and reshoot the images, after the ASA found that the models' collarbones and shoulder blades were highly visible. In this case, the ASA said it was concerned that the models used poses designed to make their bodies look thinner. This was likely to create the impression that the images were something to aspire to, it said. Fast fashion online: Can it be sustainable?

At least 13 people reportedly died in Central America over the weekend as a result of storm rains and floods. According to the Associated Press, six people were killed in Honduras, four in Nicaragua and three in El Salvador. Michael is expected to move quickly up the US East Coast, dumping rains on regions that are already saturated from Hurricane Florence last month. In their latest advisory, the National Hurricane Center warned coastal residents ""not to venture out into the relative calm of the eye, as hazardous winds will increase very quickly as the eye passes"".

The hurricane made landfall at around 14:00 (18:00 GMT), according tothe Miami-based National Hurricane Center (NHC),external. The NHC warned of a life-threatening storm surge, hurricane force winds and heavy rainfall along the north-eastern Gulf coast. It said some regions of Florida may experience storm surges of up to 14ft (4m).

A guide to the world's deadliest storms On the Saffir-Simpson hurricane scale, category four includes winds of up to 156mph with possible severe damage to even well-built homes and trees being felled. A guide to the world's deadliest storms  Hurricanes are violent storms that can bring devastation to coastal areas, threatening lives, homes and businesses. Hurricanes develop from thunderstorms, fuelled by warm, moist air as they cross sub-tropical waters.Warm air rises into the storm. Air swirls in to fill the low pressure in the storm, sucking air in and upwards, reinforcing the low pressure. The storm rotates due to the spin of the earth and energy from the warm ocean increases wind speeds as it builds. When winds reach 119km/h (74mph), it is known as a hurricane - in the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific - or a typhoon in the Western Pacific. ""Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face. Well, we're about to get punched in the face.""Florida Mayor Bob Buckhorn, ahead of Hurricane Irma (2017)  The central eye of calmer weather is surrounded by a wall of rainstorms.This eyewall has the fastest winds below it and violent currents of air rising through it. A mound of water piles up below the eye which is unleashed as the storm reaches land.These storm surges can cause more damage from flooding than the winds. ""Urgent warning about the rapid rise of water on the SW FL coast with the passage of #Irma's eye.

This video can not be played Why do people ignore hurricane warnings? Heavy rains are forecast for the Carolinas, which were drenched by Hurricane Florence last month. North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper told residents: ""I know people are fatigued from Florence, but don't let this storm catch you with your guard down."" More than 300 miles of coastline are currently under threat, the National Weather Service has said. Forecasters in Alabama have warned of possible tornados. By BBC's Gary O'Donoghue in Florida Driving through the streets of Panama City Beach this morning, there were almost no other cars on the road. Here and there the odd neon sign still glowed, but many houses and businesses were boarded up after an emergency evacuation order. Not everyone though had heeded the instruction. Dave Jackson, a man who remembers the devastation of Hurricane Andrew in southern Florida 26 years ago, has decided to stay, despite having a home just yards from the beach. His house, he says, is built to withstand winds of 150mph and it's just high enough above sea level that the predicted surge may well fall short. Just along the road, Stacey and Michael Buckner sit in their car, staring out to sea. Their house is two blocks from the water, and they've chosen not to leave because of Michael's elderly parents. For the coming hours, Dave, Michael and Stacey are on their own - the emergency services are staying out of the storm and nature is about to take its course. Communities along the Florida Panhandle will feel the brunt of the hurricane first, with Tallahassee and Panama City Beach forecast to get over 6in of rain and winds that could reach at least 100mph. Utility lines are expected to be damaged due to falling trees, leading to power outages. But by Thursday, the storm will move up the coast and skies will clear allowing for ""a massive wave of response and support"", said Gov Scott. Southern Georgia will be hit next, with residents there warned to brace for possible flash floods. Winds will die down as Michael pushes north into the soggy Carolinas with cities Columbia and Charlotte each forecasted to see up to 5in of rain. Local officials warn people in the regions affected by Hurricane Florence last month - even those living far from waterways - to watch for landslides or flash flooding.

"Al-Shabab operates freely in many rural parts of southern Somalia Somali militant group al-Shabab says it has killed five men it accuses of spying - one of them for the UK. According to a jihadi website, he had admitted giving information to British intelligence services about al-Shabab supporters living in the UK. The five men, aged between 22 and 36, were shot dead in a public execution on Tuesday in an area under the control of the Islamist group. Another was said to be working for the Somali government. That individual is alleged to have attached a device to a vehicle in an al-Shabab convoy which had then helped American drones to carry out an air strike. Al-Shabab told Reuters news agency that three of the men were US spies who had helped guide drones to carry out strikes in Somalia. The UK, US and Somali governments have not yet commented on the reports. The identity of the alleged British spy has not yet been confirmed, despite earlier reports that he was a British national. Africa Live: Updates on this and other stories Who are al-Shabab? Mourning my friend, the dry cleaner of Mogadishu 'Why I left al-Shabab' Separately,local police say suspected al-Shabab militants shot dead two non-Muslim teachersat a school compound on Tuesday night in northern Kenya, close to the Somali border. BBC correspondents say it is possible they were targeted for reasons of their religion, since the militant group has singled out Christians during previous attacks in Kenya. Al-Shabab, which is part of al-Qaeda, was forced out of the capital, Mogadishu, in 2011 by a combination of Somali government forces and African Union troops but it still operates freely in many rural parts of southern Somalia, where it often enforces Islamic law, or Sharia. This is not the first time it has killed people it accused of spying. In December 2017, al-Shabab killed five men, among them a teenage boy, whom it accused of working for US and Kenyan intelligence. As well as battling for control of Somalia, al-Shabab has staged terror attacks in some neighbouring countries. In 2013 in Kenya,67 people were killed in a mass shooting by al-Shabab militants at the Westgate shopping mallin Nairobi. The group was also behind Somalia's deadliest bombing, in whichat least 500 people were killedby a truck laden with explosives in Mogadishu last year. There are 500 US troops in Somalia supporting the UN-backed government against the militants. A smaller number of British soldiers are also deployed there. In recent years the US has carried out regular air strikes on targets in Somalia. These have been led by Africom, a body established in 2007 to run all of the US's military operations in Africa. It is unclear how many active missions Africom currently has, but US media reported that it had carried out a total of 674 operations across the continent in 2014. A British Army team with medical, logistical and engineering roles is also in Somaliasupporting the United Nations mission against the Islamist militants. Britain has long been a large financial contributor to UN peacekeeping missions The biggest number of troops by far - 22,000 - has been supplied by the African Union's Mission in Somalia (Amisom). Plans by the AU to withdraw more than 1,000 of its troops have been put on hold until 2019after the UN security council intervened,external. This followed a cut in funding by the European Union, amid allegations of corruption within the AU force, made up of personnel from Uganda, Burundi, Kenya, Ethiopia and Djibouti. Who are al-Shabab?

"The owner of Patisserie Valerie has uncovered ""significant, and potentially fraudulent, accounting irregularities"" and discovered HMRC has filed a winding-up petition against one of its subsidiaries. HMRC is seeking Â£1.14m in taxes, the company said. It said earlier that finance director Chris Marsh had been suspended. Shares in the company, 37% owned by entrepreneur Luke Johnson, have also been suspended. Mr Johnson said:  ""We are all deeply concerned about this news and the potential impact on the business. We are determined to understand the full details of what has happened and will communicate these to investors and stakeholders as soon as possible."" The company said that the board of directors had been notified of the potential fraud on Tuesday and announced it to the stock market just before its shares were due to start trading on Wednesday. Then, hours later, it made the fresh announcement that its board had just become aware of the winding-up petition by HMRC for Â£1.14m. The winding-up petition is against Stonebeach, its principal trading subsidiary, and had been filed at the High Court of Justice on 14 September. It was listed in the London Gazette, the official government bulletin, on 5 October.  A hearing is scheduled for 31 October, the company said. The company said it was ""in communication with HMRC with the objective of addressing the petition"". ""The company continues to engage with its professional advisers to understand better the financial position of the group and will make further announcements in due course,"" it said. Patisserie Holdings, which was listed on the stock market in 2014, had earlier warned that the discovery of the accounting irregularities could led to ""potential material mis-statement"" of its accounts. It also said that its cash position could be affected and ""this may lead to a material change in its overall financial position"". It has five brands: Patisserie Valerie, Druckers - Vienna Patisserie, Philpotts, Baker & Spice and Flour Power City. The first first Patisserie Valerie cafÃ© was opened on Frith Street in London's Soho district in 1926 by Belgian-born Madame Valerie. It was destroyed in World War II and a new site opened at nearby Old Compton Street. In 1987 the Scalzo family bought the Old Compton Street store and ran the business. In 2006, Luke Johnson's Risk Capital Partners bought a majority stake when it had eight stores. Now, there are 206 stores across the chain and about 2,000 staff. It was floated on the AIM stock market, for smaller companies, in 2014. The last trading update was in May, when Patisserie Valerie said its half-year profits were 14.2% up on the previous year at Â£11.1m and it had cash reserves of Â£28.8m. Its auditors, Grant Thornton, said: ""We are aware of the news released by Patisserie Valerie. Given our duty of client confidentiality it would be inappropriate for us to comment"". The first Patisserie Valerie store was opened in the Soho district of London in 1926 by a Belgian woman, Madame Valerie.  It is now part of a chain with 206 stores and  also trades in the supermarket chain Sainsbury's. Luke Johnson: The boss who likes to be very busy Earlier this year, it was linked with a possible bid for artisan bread chain Gail's, owned by Bread Holdings in which Mr Johnson has a majority stake. Patisserie Valerie - which is known as CAKE on the stock market - was floated at 170p a share and was trading at 429p before its shares were suspended. Mr Johnson bought into Patisserie Valerie in 2006, one of a number of business ventures by the entrepreneur, who built his reputation taking control of Pizza Express in 1993 before selling out in 1999. Entrepreneur Luke Johnson has a 37% stake in Patisserie Valerie He then started and later sold Signature Restaurants - owner of the Ivy, J. Sheekey and Le Caprice, as well as the Belgo and Strada restaurant chains.  He has also been involved in dental surgeries and bingo clubs. He served as chairman of Channel 4 for six years until January 2010 and set up private equity company Risk Capital Partners in 2001. As well as the stakes in Patisserie Valerie and Gail's, Mr Johnson's website also lists stakes in Neilson Active Holidays and Elegant Hotels Group, the largest hotel business in Barbados, and Xstrahl, a medical devices specialist. His website also says he is a board member of sporting goods company Zoggs and Brompton Bicycles. He is chairman of the Brighton Pier Group, Majestic Bingo and Small Batch Coffee. Among the major investors in Patisserie Holdings are Octopus Investments, which owns 8%. It declined to comment. Aberdeen Standard Investments, which owns 2.9%, said: ""This is an entirely unforeseen situation upon which we are unable to comment until the results of the investigation become known"".

"Ms Marinova is the third high-profile journalist to be killed in the EU this year A man has been arrested in Germany in connection with the rape and murder of Bulgarian journalist Viktoria Marinova. Bulgarian officials say a man named Severin Krasimirov has been detained at their request. The country's Interior Minister, Mladen Marinov, said the suspect was a DNA match for evidence recovered at the crime scene. Bulgarian authorities said there was no evidence to suggest the attack was linked to Ms Marinova's work. She had recently hosted a TV programme in which two investigative journalists discussed alleged fraud involving EU funds and prominent businessmen and politicians. However, chief prosecutor Sotir Tsatsarov said the attack seemed to have been a spontaneous sexual assault, adding that all possibilities were still being considered. Severin Krasimirov left Bulgaria for Germany on Sunday, the day after the rape and murder, Bulgarian newspaper 168 Chasa reports. Bulgarian officials said he was known to police and was suspected of attacking Viktoria Marinova while she was jogging in a park on the bank of the River Danube in the northern city of Ruse. Her body was found in the park on Saturday. Her mobile phone, keys, glasses, and some of her clothes were missing, prosecutors say. Some of her personal belongings were allegedly found in his flat. He has been accused of rape and murder and will face extradition under a European arrest warrant. German police said the 20-year-old man had been detained in Stade, near Hamburg. His mother is said to live in the town. A man detained on Tuesday in Bulgaria was released without charge. She was a presenter on a current affairs talk programme called Detector on the TVN channel, and her last show had covered alleged corruption involving EU funds. Flowers and candles for Viktoria Marinova in the city of Ruse The two investigative journalists on that programme, Attila Biro and Dimitar Stoyanov, were themselves arrested in September while looking into the case. Those details led to widespread speculation that Ms Marinova's death might have been linked to her work as a journalist. BBC Monitoring This murder has shocked the country and reignited the debate about freedom of the media in Bulgaria. Despite investigators downplaying â if not ruling out â the possibility of the crime being related to Ms Marinova's work, fellow journalists point out that there are deep suspicions about a political dimension. That is because of a ""terrible"" media atmosphere where the harassment of journalists is common. Journalist Albena Bachvarova writes in ClubZ.bg that despite calls from Europe for a swift investigation, it remains to be seen if Brussels will maintain pressure on Bulgaria â or whether it will go back on focusing on bigger problems, like Hungary and Poland. She was the third high-profile journalist to be murdered in the EU in the past year: In October 2017,Maltese journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia was killed by a car bombnear her home In February this yearSlovakian journalist Jan Kuciak and his fiancÃ©e Martina Kusnirova were shot dead On Monday, hundreds of mourners in Bulgaria held vigils for Ms Marinova. But Bulgaria's Prime Minister Boyko Borissov defended his country's record, insisting that journalists were free to report in Bulgaria. ""In three days, I've read monstrous things about Bulgaria - none of them are true,"" he said of the global reporting on Ms Marinova's murder. Bulgaria ranks 111 out of 180 countries on the Press Freedom Index,externalâ the lowest of any EU member in the Press Freedom Index.

"Geraint Thomas on the Champs-Elysees after winning this year's Tour de France Geraint Thomas is appealing for thieves to return his Tour de France trophy after it was stolen from a cycle show. Police are investigating the theft of the Coupe Omnisports - presented each year to the winner of cycling's most famous race. It was taken after Thomas's Team Sky loaned the trophy to sponsors Pinarello to display at The Cycle Show in Birmingham. Mr Thomas said: ""The trophy means a lot to me and to the team."" The black and gold handmade trophy was presented to the Welshman this summer whenhe became only the third Briton to win the Tour de France. It was put on display by Team Sky's Italian bike manufacturer Pinarello at the NEC between 28 and 30 September. What links Geraint Thomas, Empire State Building and Mona Lisa? The trophy was snatched after being ""momentarily left unattended"" during the clear-up after the show. Thomas said: ""It is incredibly unfortunate that this has happened. It goes without saying that the trophy is of pretty limited value to whoever took it and hopefully [they] will have the good grace to return it. ""A trophy is important, but clearly what matters most are the amazing memories from this incredible summer - and no-one can ever take those away."" Geraint Thomas celebrated in front of huge crowds who gathered at Cardiff Castle and the Senedd The bowl was displayed alongside the other Grand Tour trophies - the 2017 Vuelta de Espana and this year's Giro d'Italia - won by Thomas's team-mate Chris Froome. Richard Hemington, managing director of Pinarello, said the company had apologised to Thomas. He added: ""We are obviously devastated about this. We accept full responsibility. Obviously we all hope that the trophy can be recovered."" Team Sky said it was liaising with all relevant parties to agree on the best course of action to resolve the issue. West Midlands Police said the trophy is believed to have been taken sometime between 18.30 and 19.30 (GMT) on 29 September. What links Mona Lisa, Empire State & Geraint?

"Young people are turning their backs on alcohol, a new study has suggested. Researchers looked at official health data from the last decade and found almost a third of 16 to 24-year-olds in 2015 said they didn't drink, compared with around one in five in 2005.

"This video can not be played Watch how the controversial case has unfolded The Christian owners of a Northern Ireland bakery have won their appeal in the so-called ""gay cake"" discrimination case. The UK's highest court ruled that Ashers bakery's refusal to make a cake with a slogan supporting same-sex marriage was not discriminatory. The five justices on the Supreme Court wereunanimous in their judgement,external. The high-profile dispute began in 2014 when the bakery refused to make a cake with the slogan ""Support Gay Marriage"". This video can not be played Daniel and Amy McArthur, who own Ashers Bakery in Belfast, arrive at the Supreme Court in London The customer, gay rights activist Gareth Lee, sued the company for discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation and political beliefs. But the bakery has always insisted its objection was to the message on the cake, not the customer. Ashers lost the caseandthe subsequent appeal, but on Wednesday the firm won its appeal at the Supreme Court. In quotes: Reaction to judgement 'Gay cake' row Q&A Timeline: Bakery discrimination case The legal battle - which has lasted four-and-a-half years and has cost nearly Â£500,000 so far - has raised questions over equality and freedom of conscience. Ashers bakery's general manager Daniel McArthur said he was delighted and relieved by the ruling. ""I know a lot of people will be glad to hear this ruling today, because this ruling protects freedom of speech and freedom of conscience for everyone,"" Mr McArthur said outside the court. Mr Lee said the case had made him feel like a second-class citizen and that he was now concerned about ""the implications for all of the gay community"". Gareth Lee has been supported throughout the legal action by the Equality Commission ""To me, this was never about conscience or a statement. All I wanted to do was to order a cake in a shop,"" he said. Northern Ireland's Attorney General John Larkin welcomed the decision. The Equality Commission for Northern Ireland, which has supported Gareth Lee's action against Ashers, said it would study the implications of the judgement carefully. ""There is a concern that this judgement may raise uncertainty about the application of equality law in the commercial sphere, both about what businesses can do and what customers may expect,"" said Dr Michael Wardlow, the organisation's chief commissioner. By Mark Simpson at the Supreme Court in London Questions will now be asked as to whether the Equality Commission was right to spend more than Â£250,000 of public money on this case. DUP Ian Paisley MP said he has written to the Northern Ireland Secretary calling for a review of the organisation's funding. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The commission backed Mr Lee, who ordered the ""gay cake"" but was refused. Four years later, the Supreme Court has ruled it was not a case of discrimination. Ashers bakery has spent more Â£200,000 on the case. It is being paid by The Christian Institute, a charity and lobby group. The cake at the centre of the dispute would have cost Â£36.50. It has proved to be the most expensive cake order in UK history. Customer Gareth Lee requested a cake featuring the Sesame Street characters Bert and Ernie, iced with the message: ""Support Gay Marriage."" His order was initially accepted at a branch of Ashers in Belfast city centre, but two days later the baking firm's head office contacted Mr Lee to say the firm would not make the cake. The family-run baking company, based in County Antrim, has described the same-sex marriage slogan as ""inconsistent"" with its religious beliefs. Daniel McArthur, pictured here with his wife Amy, said Ashers had served Mr Lee before, and would do so again But it points out that the company's issue was with the slogan and not Mr Lee, claiming it would have refused the same order from a heterosexual client. As he arrived outside the Supreme Court for the start of the case in May, Mr McArthur said: ""We didn't say no because of the customer; we'd served him before, we'd serve him again. ""It was because of the message. But some people want the law to make us support something with which we disagree."" In the court's judgement (case reference [2018] UKSC 49), president of the Supreme Court Lady Hale ruled that the bakers did not refuse to fulfil the order because of his sexual orientation. ""They would have refused to make such a cake for any customer, irrespective of their sexual orientation,"" she said. Ashers Baking Company is situated on Royal Avenue in Belfast ""Their objection was to the message on the cake, not to the personal characteristics of Mr Lee."" She added: ""Accordingly, this court holds that there was no discrimination on the ground of the sexual orientation of Mr Lee."" When Mr Lee first took action against the firm, he said the bakery's actions left him feeling like a lesser person. On Wednesday, the Supreme Court ruled that there was no political discrimination as well as no discrimination based on Mr Lee's sexual orientation. ""This conclusion is not in any way to diminish the need to protect gay people and people who support gay marriage from discrimination,"" said Lady Hale. ""It is deeply humiliating, and an affront to human dignity, to deny someone a service because of that person's race, gender, disability, sexual orientation, religion or belief. ""But that is not what happened in this case."" Five Supreme Courts justices travelled to Belfast earlier this yearto hear the case. Some will regard the ruling - that service providers of any religion, race or sexual orientation can refuse to endorse a message they profoundly disagree with - as a victory for freedom of expression and freedom of ideas, says BBC legal correspondent Clive Coleman. The ruling now poses the question whether it would be lawful, for instance, for a bakery to refuse to make a bar mitzvah cake because the bakers' owners disagreed with ideas at the heart of the Jewish religion? What about a cake promoting ""the glory of Brexit"", ""support fox hunting"", or ""support veganism""? As a result of Wednesday's ruling, there are likely to be further cases in which services are refused on the basis of beliefs held by the service providers, adds our correspondent.

"The European Court of Human Rights has dismissed a legal challenge in a long-running dispute known as the ""gay cake"" case, ruling the action inadmissible. The ECHR is the latest court to have its say in the long-running controversy. It all started in 2014, when a bakery in Northern Ireland refused to make a cake with a slogan supporting same-sex marriage. Here's a look at how the case reached Strasbourg: Ashers is a Christian-owned bakery Ashers Baking Company was founded in Newtownabbey in 1992. Run by the McArthur family, the Christian-owned business operates several shops in Northern Ireland. The bakery came to wider prominence in July 2014 whenit emerged that it had declined an orderin its Belfast branch from gay rights activist Gareth Lee. He had wanted them to make a cake that included a slogan that said ""support gay marriage"" along with a picture of Bert and Ernie from Sesame Street, and the logo of the Queerspace organisation. At the time, same-sex marriage was still illegal in Northern Ireland, but the law has since changed andsame-sex weddings have been taking place since February 2020. The cake was being commissioned for a civic event in Bangor, County Down, to mark International Day Against Homophobia and Transphobia. Staff at the bakery passed the order to its head office, which considered it to be ""at odds"" with their beliefs. Another bakery agreed to accept the order. Councillor Andrew Muir cuts the replacement cake that was made by another bakery The customer who placed the order with Ashers complained to Northern Ireland's Equality Commission, and the watchdog took up the case, warning the company it had allegedly discriminated against the man on the grounds of his sexual orientation. The Equality Commission said it raised ""issues of public importance regarding the extent to which suppliers of goods and services can refuse service on grounds of sexual orientation, religious belief and/or political opinion"". The commission supported Mr Lee in taking his legal case alleging discrimination. However, Ashers said it was taking a stand on the grounds of religious freedom. The bakery's stance was backed by the Christian Institute, which provided legal assistance. A Catholic delegation met DUP assembly member Paul Givan (right) The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), led at the time by Northern Ireland First Minister Peter Robinson, led the opposition at the NI Assembly to the Equality Commission's case. DUP assembly member Paul Givan (now first minister) drafted a Private Member's Bill seeking tobuild a conscience clauseinto equality law in Northern Ireland. This clause would allow businesses to refuse to provide some services if they clashed with their strongly-held religious convictions. Mr Givan said: ""Christians do not feel there is space being made for their religious beliefs."" The Catholic Church said itsupported the general objectiveof the DUP's move. However, opponents of the bill, led by Sinn FÃ©in,pledged to block the clauseand therefore it never reached the stage of a vote. Thousands of people attended a rally in protest over the DUP's conscience clause bill Rival demonstrations were held in support of both sides in the case. In January 2015, thousands of peoplegathered at Belfast City Hall to protestover the DUP's conscience clause bill. The crowd was addressed by politicians from Alliance, Sinn FÃ©in and SDLP, as well as community leaders. A demonstration in support of the bakery's stance was staged at Belfast's Waterfront Hall Two days before the court hearing in Belfast in 2015, more than 2,000 people gathered at the city's Waterfront Hall venue toshow their support for Ashers. Hundreds more supporters stood outside the venue and sang hymns. Gareth Lee, who placed the cake order with Ashers, said the refusal made him feel ""unworthy"" The court case in Belfast ran for three days in March 2015. During the hearings, a lawyer for the bakery argued the issue was ""the cake, not the customer"". One of the bakers, Karen McArthur, said she did not know Mr Lee was gay and it would not have mattered as they would not have been prepared to make a cake with a pro-same-sex marriage slogan for anyone. However, Mr Lee said he felt he was discriminated against. He said that after ordering the cake and paying for it, only to be told two days later that his order had been rejected: ""It made me feel unworthy, a lesser person."" While the debate leading up to the hearing had been often heated,the BBC's Mark Simpson foundthat in the courtroom it was a different story, and there was ""no heckling, shouting or jeering"". ""There was respect between the legal teams, politeness from the witnesses and a respectful atmosphere inside the courtroom, including the packed public gallery,"" he said. This video can not be played Daniel McArthur, manager of Ashers Bakery, said they were ""extremely disappointed with the judgment"" The judge found in favour of Mr Lee,external, saying that as a business, Ashers was not exempt from discrimination law. District Judge Isobel Brownlie said Ashers was ""conducting a business for profit"" and it was not a religious group. The firm was found to have discriminated against Mr Lee on the grounds of sexual orientation as well as his political beliefs. The judge said she accepted Ashers had ""genuine and deeply held"" religious views, but said the business was not above the law. Damages of Â£500 were agreed in advance by legal teams on both sides of the dispute. This video can not be played Robin Allen QC said his client Gareth Lee was ""very glad"" the case was finished In October 2016, the owners of the bakery lost their appeal against the ruling that their refusal to make a ""gay cake"" was discriminatory. Appeal court judges said that, under law,the bakers were not allowed to provide a service only to people who agreed with their religious beliefs,external. Reacting to the ruling, Daniel McArthur from Ashers said he was ""extremely disappointed"" adding that it undermined ""democratic freedom, religious freedom and free speech"". The firm then took the case to the Supreme Court and they won. The UK's highest court ruled the bakery's refusal to make a cake with a slogan supporting same-sex marriagewas not discriminatory. Then president of the Supreme Court, Lady Hale, ruled the bakers did not refuse to fulfil the order because of the customer's sexual orientation. ""They would have refused to make such a cake for any customer, irrespective of their sexual orientation,"" she said. ""Their objection was to the message on the cake, not to the personal characteristics of Mr Lee."" And from there, Mr Lee took his case to Europe, arguing the UK Supreme Court ""failed to give appropriate weight"" to his case under the European Convention of Human Rights.

"The highest court in the UK has ruled the Christian owners of a bakery did not discriminate against a customer by refusing to make a cake decorated with the words ""Support Gay Marriage"". In a judgement delivered in London, the Supreme Court ruledthat the refusal of Ashers bakery in Belfast to make the so-called ""gay cake"" was not discriminatory. Here is how people have reacted to the decision. ""We're particularly pleased the Supreme Court emphatically accepted what we've said all along - we did not turn down this order because of the person who made it, but because of the message itself. ""The judges have given a clear signal today. In fact it couldn't be any clearer. ""Family businesses like ours are free to focus on giving all their customers the best service they can - without being forced to promote other people's campaigns."" ""To me, this was never about a campaign or a statement. All I wanted was to order a cake in a shop that sold cakes to order. ""I paid my money, my money was taken and then a few days later it was refused. That made me feel like a second-class citizen. ""I'm concerned not just for the implications for myself and other gay people, but for every single one of us."" ""While sympathetic as some may be to the position in which the company finds itself, this does not change the facts of the case. ""We believe this is direct discrimination for which there can be no justification. ""We will however take time to study this judgment by the Supreme Court to understand fully its implications for the rights of LGBT people to access goods, facilities and services without discrimination."" ""The Ashers ruling is an historic and seminal judgement. ""This has been a long journey for everyone involved in the case. ""I commend Amy and Daniel McArthur for their grace and perseverance. This now provides clarity for people of all faiths and none."" ""The law seems to be saying from this judgement that the belief of the company has actually precedence over the belief of the person who wants the service. ""It doesn't seem to us that that's the right balance. ""If we have to do this on a case to case basis, then no-one has assurance when they go in that they're going to get the service that they've asked for."" ""I have written to the secretary of state for NI calling for a review of funding for the Equality Commission. ""After such a finding by the Supreme Court the Equality Commission's immediate response has been to threaten to waste more public money on this case. Stop it now."" ""I welcome the decision of the Supreme Court in the Ashers' appeal. ""This decision provides an important protection against any misapplication of our equality law that would seek to compel citizens to express views with which they may disagree on grounds of their deeply held political or religious beliefs."" ""Although I profoundly disagree with Ashers' opposition to marriage equality, in a free society neither they nor anyone else should be forced to facilitate a political idea that they oppose. ""If the original judgement against Ashers had been upheld, it would have meant that a Muslim printer could be obliged to publish cartoons of Mohammed and a Jewish printer could be forced to publish a book that propagates Holocaust denial."" ""I think this is a win for everyone today. ""It prevents compelled speech and the court was very clear that people of every description, of every protected characteristic, should continue to be protected from discrimination, but that's not what was happening in this case."" ""This is a timely judgement in bringing common sense to an issue which, fuelled by LGBT activists and extremists, had run away with itself. ""The effort to impose the LGBT agenda on Christian businesses by compelling promotion of their political demands, irrespective of the conscience or religious belief of the business owner, needed to be reined in."" ""The immediate effect of the ruling is to create legal uncertainty with regards to what constitutes discriminatory practice within Northern Ireland. ""This matter has also damaged community relations with vested interests attempting to portray it as a battle between those of faith versus those of differing sexual orientation."" ""On this occasion the right to the exercise of Christian conscience in business has been protected, but in other cases it has not. ""We commend the patient endurance shown by the MacArthur family, which has been a powerful example and witness."" ""Finally some common sense has prevailed. ""This is a great decision in favour of religious freedom and in favour of freedom of speech and expression.""

"Mr Akbar has not responded to the allegations against him A former prominent newspaper editor who is now a junior foreign minister is the latest to be named in what is being called India's #MeToo movement. MJ Akbar is accused of predatory behaviour, including inviting young women to hotel rooms for ""meetings"". Neither Mr Akbar nor the foreign ministry have responded to the historic allegations against him. But another minister, Maneka Gandhi, said all allegations, including those against politicians, must be probed. Mr Akbar is the most senior person so far to be named in the flurry of allegations that have been made against comedians, journalists, authors, actors and filmmakers in the last few days. Read more about India's #MeToo firestorm One of India's most influential editors, he has edited leading English-language newspapers such as The Telegraph and The Asian Age. He was first named on Monday by senior journalist Priya Ramani, who retweeted an article she had written for Vogue India a year ago titled ""To the Harvey Weinsteins of the world"", where she recounted what she called her first experience of workplace harassment. What has #MeToo actually changed? Was Delhi gang rape India's #MeToo moment? Ms Ramani did not name anyone in the original piece, but said in Monday's tweet that the article had been about Mr Akbar. Since then, five other women have also come forward with their own stories, naming Mr Akbar. At least one other anonymous account is believed to be about him. Apart from Mr Akbar, veteran actors Alok Nath and film director Vikas Bahl have been accused of sexual assault. Nath has denied the allegations, while Bahl has not responded.

"Geraint Thomas on the Champs-Elysees after winning this year's Tour de France Geraint Thomas is appealing for thieves to return his Tour de France trophy after it was stolen from a cycle show. Police are investigating the theft of the Coupe Omnisports - presented each year to the winner of cycling's most famous race. It was taken after Thomas's Team Sky loaned the trophy to sponsors Pinarello to display at The Cycle Show in Birmingham. Mr Thomas said: ""The trophy means a lot to me and to the team."" The black and gold handmade trophy was presented to the Welshman this summer whenhe became only the third Briton to win the Tour de France. It was put on display by Team Sky's Italian bike manufacturer Pinarello at the NEC between 28 and 30 September. What links Geraint Thomas, Empire State Building and Mona Lisa? The trophy was snatched after being ""momentarily left unattended"" during the clear-up after the show. Thomas said: ""It is incredibly unfortunate that this has happened. It goes without saying that the trophy is of pretty limited value to whoever took it and hopefully [they] will have the good grace to return it. ""A trophy is important, but clearly what matters most are the amazing memories from this incredible summer - and no-one can ever take those away."" Geraint Thomas celebrated in front of huge crowds who gathered at Cardiff Castle and the Senedd The bowl was displayed alongside the other Grand Tour trophies - the 2017 Vuelta de Espana and this year's Giro d'Italia - won by Thomas's team-mate Chris Froome. Richard Hemington, managing director of Pinarello, said the company had apologised to Thomas. He added: ""We are obviously devastated about this. We accept full responsibility. Obviously we all hope that the trophy can be recovered."" Team Sky said it was liaising with all relevant parties to agree on the best course of action to resolve the issue.

"Catherine says the dangers of gambling aren't highlighted ""A few years ago, I got an email from a betting website. I was only 12 or 13, so I wasn't interested. ""But for someone who got that email, being contacted personally, it could almost entice them to gamble, like it's their duty."" Catherine, now 15, was shocked to receive the email and says the risks associated with gambling should be more widely publicised, as they are with smoking, for example. ""People that smoke know it's a danger. It's on the packet. It says that it kills. It's not disguised. It's quite obvious. ""But things like gambling - where it starts off as a little bit of fun but where you could get addicted and then can't get out of the spiral - it doesn't show the dangers. ""You never see on a lottery ticket saying, 'This could lead to poverty.'"" Catherine, a Year 11 student at St Joseph's Catholic School in Salisbury, Wilts, is one of 650 teenagers to have taken part in trials of lessons designed to try to raise awareness of the risks of gambling among school-age children. The series of four lessons, developed by the think tank Demos, encourages pupils to weigh up risks, identify manipulative behaviour by gambling companies, learn about managing impulses and help others experiencing gambling problems. The trials come as arecent report,externalby the Gambling Commission suggests up to 25,000 11- to 16-year-olds are problem gamblers, with many learning to bet via computer games and social media. Pupils at St Joseph's say they were glad to learn more about the risks, because they think gambling is becoming more prevalent. ""Gambling is becoming more popular because we have so many online websites that we didn't have before,"" says Grace, 15.

"Catherine says the dangers of gambling aren't highlighted ""A few years ago, I got an email from a betting website. I was only 12 or 13, so I wasn't interested. ""But for someone who got that email, being contacted personally, it could almost entice them to gamble, like it's their duty."" Catherine, now 15, was shocked to receive the email and says the risks associated with gambling should be more widely publicised, as they are with smoking, for example. ""People that smoke know it's a danger. It's on the packet. It says that it kills. It's not disguised. It's quite obvious. ""But things like gambling - where it starts off as a little bit of fun but where you could get addicted and then can't get out of the spiral - it doesn't show the dangers. ""You never see on a lottery ticket saying, 'This could lead to poverty.'"" Catherine, a Year 11 student at St Joseph's Catholic School in Salisbury, Wilts, is one of 650 teenagers to have taken part in trials of lessons designed to try to raise awareness of the risks of gambling among school-age children. The series of four lessons, developed by the think tank Demos, encourages pupils to weigh up risks, identify manipulative behaviour by gambling companies, learn about managing impulses and help others experiencing gambling problems. The trials come as arecent report,externalby the Gambling Commission suggests up to 25,000 11- to 16-year-olds are problem gamblers, with many learning to bet via computer games and social media. Pupils at St Joseph's say they were glad to learn more about the risks, because they think gambling is becoming more prevalent.

"This video can not be played Virtual flyover of new Lower Thames Crossing A new road linking Kent and Essex would almost double capacity across the River Thames, Highways England has said. The route of the new road tunnel under the river would also almost halve the northbound crossing times at the Dartford Crossing, the agency said. It is claimed the scheme, for which motorists will be charged, will be the largest road upgrade project since the building of the M25. Friends of the Earth said the crossing would lead to more air pollution. Jenny Bates from the environmental group said: ""It's astonishing that in the week the UN is warning of the need for urgent action to avoid catastrophic climate change, the UK government is boasting about building more roads. ""This road development will only encourage more cars, vans, lorries and traffic, pumping more air pollution and climate-damaging emissions into our environment. ""Politicians need to take their foot off the accelerator in order to protect the planet."" The planned new 14.5 mile (23km) long three-lane dual carriageway would connect the M2 near Rochester and the M25 in Essex between North and South Ockendon and include a 2.4 mile (3.8km) tunnel between Gravesend and Tilbury. Tim Jones, project director for the Lower Thames Crossing, told the BBC there will be a charge for using the crossing. He said: ""We are going to ask people's view on a variable charge because we think that my be more suitable."" He said the charging structure will be part of the10-week public consultation,externalon the latest designs for the crossing. ""It's not a toll and it will continue. A toll is normally to pay for a piece of infrastructure - this will be a user charge."" Adam Holloway, the Conservative MP for Gravesham in Kent, said: ""The M25 will always run through Dartford and building this road will make very little difference to the people of Dartford in terms of the amount of traffic. ""I think the new proposals are great - they are just what we've been asking for, with the tunnel entrance further south and a deeper road, but it's very grim for the people who live there."" Transport Secretary Chris Grayling said: ""The Lower Thames Crossing will help transform journeys, create new business opportunities in Kent and Essex and unlock productivity across the UK."" A spokesman for Highways England said the new tunnel would be the longest road tunnel in the UK - and at over 50ft (15m) wide would become the third-largest bored tunnel in the world. He said the updated designs ""include significant changes to minimise the impact on local communities and the environment"". Edmund King from the AA said the Seine in Paris has ""almost twice as many river crossings as we have over or under the Thames"" and the proposed tunnel is ""essential new infrastructure"". RAC Foundation director Steve Gooding said: ""It is vital this project is got right so that it delivers benefits not just for drivers travelling from one end of the country to the other, but also residents of Kent and Essex for whom the Thames often seems like an unbridgeable barrier."" New designs for the tunnel entrance make the entrance 600m further south to reduce the impact on the landscape, Highways England said Benny the beluga 'cannot be hauled out' The town that's 'royal wedding-ed out' 'How running has helped my mental health' Mr Jones said: ""For too long the Dartford Crossing has been the only way to get across the Thames east of London. It is a vital gateway but carries more traffic than it was ever designed for and drivers there suffer from regular delays. ""The Lower Thames Crossing is the most ambitious project of its kind ever in the UK and the biggest single road upgrade since the M25 was completed more than 30 years ago. ""It would almost double road capacity across the Thames."" The Green South East MEP Keith Taylor said the tunnel was ""inducing traffic rather than reducing congestion"". He said: ""The estimated Â£6bn earmarked for the new crossing should be redirected towards innovative and truly sustainable 21st Century alternatives, including projects to move freight from our roads on to the rails, seas, and waterways. ""We also urgently need investment in integrated and affordable public and active transport networks, directed by local communities, which will reduce traffic and markedly improve the quality of life for residents in Kent and beyond.""

"The UK economy grew by 0.7% in the three months to August, buoyed by the hot summer, the Office for National Statistics said. But the ONS said that in August, GDP growth was flat. Economists had predicted 0.1% growth. The three-month measure was the fastest pace of growth since February 2017, economists said. The ONS's head of GDP, Rob Kent-Smith, said the economy had ""continued to rebound strongly after a weak spring"". He said retail, food and drink production and house building had all performed particularly well during the hot summer months. ""However, long-term growth continues to lag behind its historical trend,"" Mr Kent-Smith added. The ONS has introduced monthly measures of GDP and provides three-month rolling growth figures, rather than the quarterly figures it published in the past. Andrew Wishart, UK economist at Capital Economists, said the three-month 0.7% figure was higher than the 0.6% expected because of upward revisions to earlier data. Datalast month had shownthe economy grew by 0.3% in July. The latest figures revised this up to 0.4% and the figure for June was also revised upwards. ""Rolling three-month growth in the services and construction sectors eased compared to July, but this was offset by industrial production recovering from its recent contraction,"" Mr Wishart said. By Simon Jack, BBC business editor A three month growth rate of 0.7% looks pretty darn good for an economy generally forecast to grow somewhere between 1% and 1.5% for the whole year. But as always, there is some salt to be pinched. The three-month figure continues to be flattered by a strong showing from construction in June and July, caused by a bounce-back in activity after a weather-affected beginning of the year. Next month, June's strong performance from production, construction and manufacturing will drop out of the rolling three-month calculation. The figures also show that the UK economy did not grow at all in August. Now that is not the end of the world, as it means the economy didn't shrink after a strong June and July. In summary, it looks like the UK economy is on track to record a pretty good third quarter, but there will be no sound of corks popping in the Treasury. The ONS said that growth was picking up from April,when data for the first quarter of the year was showing the weakest growth since 2012, only partly because of the cold weather. The UK then had a heatwave, which the ONS has said helped to fuel growth in the retail sector. Taking a longer-term view, the ONS said growth in the services sector - which makes up 80% of the economy - was subdued when compared with the same three months a year earlier. According to the ONS: Monthly growth in the services sector was flat, while grew over the three months. Monthly growth in production was 0.2%, although within that, manufacturing shrank by 0.2%. Over three months, production growth was 0.7%. The construction sector shrank by 0.7% in August, but grew by 2.9% on the three-month measure. Lee Hopley, chief economist at EEF, the manufacturers' organisation, said: ""The main takeaway from today's bumper crop of releases on the economy is that the UK saw a spurt of activity in June and July not seen since the end of 2016. Beyond that, it seems that it's back to business as usual more or less in August. ""The underlying services picture looks to be slow and steady, the construction sector has recovered its weather-related losses from earlier in the year and manufacturing weakness is persisting in the second half of this year so far,"" Ms Hopley said. John Hawksworth, chief economist at PwC, said the economy was on track for an annual growth rate of 1.5%. ""This is somewhat below its longer-term trend rate of around 2% and reflects the continued drag on business investment, in particular from Brexit-related uncertainty,"" he said.

"Mr Akbar has not responded to the allegations against him A former prominent newspaper editor who is now a junior foreign minister is the latest to be named in what is being called India's #MeToo movement. MJ Akbar is accused of predatory behaviour, including inviting young women to hotel rooms for ""meetings"". Neither Mr Akbar nor the foreign ministry have responded to the historic allegations against him. But another minister, Maneka Gandhi, said all allegations, including those against politicians, must be probed. Mr Akbar is the most senior person so far to be named in the flurry of allegations that have been made against comedians, journalists, authors, actors and filmmakers in the last few days. Read more about India's #MeToo firestorm One of India's most influential editors, he has edited leading English-language newspapers such as The Telegraph and The Asian Age. He was first named on Monday by senior journalist Priya Ramani, who retweeted an article she had written for Vogue India a year ago titled ""To the Harvey Weinsteins of the world"", where she recounted what she called her first experience of workplace harassment. What has #MeToo actually changed? Was Delhi gang rape India's #MeToo moment? Ms Ramani did not name anyone in the original piece, but said in Monday's tweet that the article had been about Mr Akbar. Since then, five other women have also come forward with their own stories, naming Mr Akbar. At least one other anonymous account is believed to be about him. Apart from Mr Akbar, veteran actors Alok Nath and film director Vikas Bahl have been accused of sexual assault. Nath has denied the allegations, while Bahl has not responded.

"For many students, drinking and parties are a big part of the freshers' experience. But with more than one in five students saying they are teetotal, the demand for alcohol-free accommodation is on the rise. Mohamed is 19 and about to start his second year at Aberdeen University. He describes himself as talkative and easy to get along with. His only concern when starting university? He doesn't drink. As a Muslim he is teetotal for religious reasons so he opted for alcohol-free halls of residence. ""I would have felt uncomfortable living in a place where people were drinking. I didn't want to be in that environment,"" he says. 'Generation Sensible' in five charts What's it like being young and teetotal? But far from being a boring place to be, he says he loved living there. ""I could still meet lots of people and get involved in activities"". ""Some of my friends went straight into private accommodation and they missed out on stuff because they were living further away from the campus."" The alcohol-free block at Aberdeen University was relatively small when it was introduced last year and the 30 rooms available were only half full. But at other universities the idea has proved more popular. More than 400 students applied for alcohol-free accommodation at St Andrews University last year - far exceeding the 132 rooms available. Other universities which now offer booze-free living options include Chester, Bristol, Canterbury Christ Church and the University of West England. Aberdeen student Lachlan Shanks says he wanted to avoid booze-fuelled parties in his flat The rise in accommodation options comes asa growing number of young people are choosing not to drink,external. More than a fifth say they are teetotal, with financial pressures, a wider diversity of faiths and increased health awareness thought to be contributing factors. Mohamed says: ""There were quite a few people who did drink but only in moderation. A couple of my flatmates still went to parties and clubs. I think they were mainly worried about being in a noisy flat."" Lachlan Shanks, 19, also chose the alcohol-free block at Aberdeen University. He prefers not to drink himself and says he is a quiet person. ""If I had flatmates that liked drinking and clubbing I wouldn't have had much in common with them,"" he says. ""I thought if I picked the alcohol-free block people wouldn't be coming home late or having parties in the flat."" Nearly four in five students surveyed by the National Union of Students (79%) still believe that getting drunk is part of university culture - and only one in 10 are aware of responsible drinking activities or campaigns on campus. Lauren Seward says she spent a lot of time on her own during freshers week because she didn't drink. Lauren Seward, 22, is teetotal and says she would ""definitely"" have considered alcohol-free accommodation if the option had been available. She graduated from the University of Kent in 2017 and lived in halls in her first year but often felt lonely because so many activities revolved around drinking. ""Freshers' week was the worst because at that point everyone is really obsessed about going out and drinking so I spent a lot of time on my own,"" she says. Although she eventually made friends outside her halls she said an alcohol-free option would have been appealing. ""On the one hand it's good to meet different people and plenty of my friends drink. But in first year it would give some reassurance that at least at home you won't have to deal with people drinking all the time."" Eva Crossan Jory, vice president for welfare for the NUS says if students are asking for these sorts of spaces, universities should offer them as an option. ""We also need to foster more responsible drinking cultures amongst students and offer more events and activities which aren't centred on drinking that everyone can enjoy."" But Georgia, 19, who is also teetotal, says she didn't want to live somewhere that marked her out as different. Her university, Plymouth Marjon, didn't have an alcohol-free option so she lived in ordinary halls in her first year. Although initially quite nervous about being around big groups drinking and worries about feeling left out, she soon made friends and found not drinking ""wasn't an issue"". ""I feel like if I'd been in alcohol-free halls I would have been judged by other students when I told them where I lived and subject to more scrutiny about 'why don't you drink?'. ""It could work for some people but I wouldn't want to be labelled like that,"" she says. Mohamed says he didn't find this a problem. ""It wasn't segregated at all. I don't think that many people actually knew there was an alcohol-free block in my halls. I had friends living in other halls and other blocks. The only difference is there isn't alcohol in your own flat,"" he says. 'Generation Sensible' in five charts What's it like being young and teetotal?

"Rebellions of young people have been recorded for decades, bucking trends and breaking the rules before entering the world of being a boring grown-up. But a new generation is coming through and truly shocking society. How? By becoming more sensible. For example, a survey conducted by the British Pregnancy Advisory Service showedteenagers are becoming less likely to have sex, preferring to spend time with their families and having romantic relationships online.

"This video can not be played If a night out is boring it's because you're with boring people, says non-drinker Allan Faulds. (Video shot and edited by the BBC's Nick Sheridan) Britain's booze problems are well documented, with alcohol misuse costing the NHS more than Â£4bn every year. However, one in five UK adults do not drink and young people are more likely than any other age group to keep off the strong stuff. Why is that? We speak to three young teetotallers. Derryn says he is in a much better place with his mental health now Derryn Balmer, 17, decided to be alcohol-free after the impact it had on his childhood. He had to move in with his grandparents at the age of 11 due to his mum's alcoholism. ""I knew about it and hid it from everyone for a long time before her addiction pushed me over the edge. I was depressed and breaking down in primary school about it. ""I've dealt with and overcome a lot through all of this and I've always wanted to avoid alcohol my whole life."" Did you know? Asurvey in 2015 showed that the percentage of 15-year-olds,externalwho said they had had alcohol stood at 17% - that was down massively on the 2010 figure of 34%. Derryn, who is currently studying Sound Production at Ayrshire College, is an aspiring hip-hop and pop artist/producer. How does a career so heavily linked with alcohol and substance misuse sit with his own lifestyle choice? ""I think I could just enjoy the music whether I'm in the crowd or behind the decks. Under peer pressure I'd never accept anything, I'd say no thanks all night if that's what it took,"" he explains. He says: ""I'm happy being the only sober person by the end of the night if I go out somewhere where there's drinking. ""If I don't have to personally deal with someone who's had too much to drink by myself, then I'm not bothered usually."" For others, the decision not to drink was simply a case of disliking the taste of alcohol and seeing friends drink to excess has further embedded their lifestyle. Cathy Louise, 20, does not like the taste of alcohol Cathy Louise is a 20-year-old vlogger who has never been interested in drink. She says the health issues were never a part of her decision: ""I just hate the taste and the fact that you lose control."" ""I have never been drunk but have experienced other people drinking to excess which is never fun so that has also put me off ever drinking."" Did you know? In 2015 some 21% of adults in the UK say they do not drink -with young adults (those aged 16 to 24) becoming just as likely to be teetotallers,externalas those aged 65 and over Dealing with and looking after drunk people has become a feature of her social life, however. ""I am usually expected to look after people who get drunk. I feel that's not my job, although I try to make sure people are safe. ""I have been at parties where people who drank to excess kept turning on the gas without igniting the flame on a hob and I had to constantly turn it off. I felt really scared because I didn't know what else they might try. ""Some people know their limits and stop drinking and look after themselves, but some people just can't seem to stop. ""I don't mind being around people who are having a drink but dealing with people who have collapsed or have made themselves incredibly ill because of alcohol is a lot to handle when it's late and you're tired and you're young."" Allan Faulds with his drink of choice, a milkshake Allan Faulds grew up in West Dunbartonshire, one of theareas most affected by alcohol abuse in Scotland,external. The 27-year-old says he made the decision not to drink when he was in his mid-teens, reaffirming that commitment in his twenties. He admits his first decision was borne out of a fear of outing himself when inebriated: ""I wasn't comfortable with my sexuality and was really worried if I did drink I'd somehow let slip that I was gay. ""Since then I'm more than happy in who I am, and I've chosen to continue not drinking because I simply don't see the point in starting - it's expensive, it's often unhealthy, and I don't need alcohol to enjoy myself."" Back in 2005, 19% of people aged between 16 and 24 in the UK reported not drinking at all. In 2017, this had increased to 22.8% according toofficial statistics,external. Despite the increase in teetotal young people, drinkers in this age group are still more likely to binge more heavily than older people. There are more than 10,000 deaths per year in the UKlinked to drink, while 1.4 million hospital admissions annually are related to the consumption of alcohol. So what do our teetotallers think of Briton's booze culture? Derryn believes it is an issue of moderation rather than encouraging more people to be alcohol-free: ""I think people just need to be conscious about the impact their decisions have if they go overboard or develop bad habits."" Allan says it is ""a pretty serious problem"" based on the idea that ""it's not possible to have a good night out without alcohol"". He says: ""In my earlier 20s, a lot of people seemed to gauge how good a night out was by how little they remembered about it afterwards because they got so blazingly drunk. That's really unhealthy."" What's it like being young and teetotal? Video, 00:01:16What's it like being young and teetotal?

"The IMF's managing director Christine Lagarde and US President Donald Trump One of the most comprehensive studies of the state of banking and markets since the financial crisis warns that ""dangerous undercurrents"" are a rising threat to the world economy. The International Monetary Fund'sFinancial Stability Report,externalsays that although banks are far safer than they were in 2008 there are new risks. Trade tensions are growing, the IMF says, and inequality has risen. Further moves towards a trade war could ""significantly harm global growth"". Other threats to trade, such as a disorderly Brexit, could also ""adversely affect market sentiment"", the IMF argues. The US-based organisation says that a ""no-deal"" departure from the European Union could lead to fragmentation in European money markets, meaning that finance cannot flow around the system so efficiently. The body urges the Bank of England to be ready to provide more quantitative easing - money printing - if it is required. In a separate report, the IMF said the UK had historically weak public finances with high levels of debt and low levels of assets. Britain sold off many of its assets in the privatisations of the 1980s and 1990s and also did not create a sovereign wealth fund from its oil revenues, which Norway did. Of leading industrialised countries, only Portugal's ""net worth"" was in a poorer position, the IMF said. That could mean that Britain will have to raise more taxes in the future because government-owned asset growth will not provide as much support to the economy. The Financial Stability Report is the second time in 24 hours the IMF has published sober warnings about the state of global finance. On Monday, it downgraded world growth forecasts for next year, blaming new trade barriers. Tuesday's report says governments should resist attempts to roll back banking regulations put in place in 2008 to stop a similar financial crisis happening again. This video can not be played Storms, viruses, bankers: What could cause another economic crisis? President Donald Trump has already pushed through laws repealing banking rules in America for smaller institutions, saying they were holding back bank lending to businesses. The IMF also warns market investors, who have seen the largest upward bull run in stocks in history. The report says they are in danger of becoming complacent about the chances of an economic shock to the system. One could be the ending of ""easy money"". Central banks are starting to withdraw the stimulus that was put in place at the time of the financial crisis. Interest rates are rising and quantitative easing - money printing - being dialled back. The IMF fears this could lead to sharp falls in markets. The risks of a government funding crisis in Italy, where the country's banks are under pressure, is also highlighted. Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte thinks the IMF's forecasts for Italy should be revised in light of its new budget ""Looking ahead, clouds appear on the horizon,"" the report, published at the body's annual meeting in Bali, Indonesia, says. ""Support for multilateralism has been waning, a dangerous undercurrent that may undermine confidence in policymakers' ability to respond to future crises. ""Nonetheless, despite trade tensions and continued monetary policy normalisation in a few advanced economies, global financial markets have remained buoyant and appear complacent about the risk of a sudden, sharp tightening in financial conditions."" The IMF's warnings will increase fears that the present buoyancy in global growth may not last. The American economy has been performing strongly, encouraging international investors to move capital there and invest in the dollar. To cool inflationary pressure, the American central bank, the Federal Reserve, is raising interest rates, which acts as a further attraction to global capital because returns are higher. That puts pressure on emerging market economies such as Turkey and Argentina, which have large amounts of debt which concerns investors. The IMF says there is a ""risk of contagion"" as investors become increasingly nervous about the strength of emerging markets, with the risk of capital flows towards the US accelerating. The report says that outflows could hit $100bn (Â£76.4bn) over a year, about 0.6% of emerging market economies' gross national income. That would be ""of a magnitude"" similar to the financial crisis.

A wave of muddy water engulfed the town of Sant LlorenÃ§ des Cardassar, in the east of the island, after heavy rain caused a river to burst its banks. Vehicles were swept away as water gushed through narrow streets. Hundreds of emergency workers and sniffer dogs are involved in the search-and-rescue effort. A five-year-old child is missing. The dead include six Spanish nationals, a Dutch tourist, a British couple and one unidentified victim. Vehicles were photographed piled up in places Worst affected was the town of Sant LlorenÃ§ des Cardassar, where cars were swept away. The British couple was travelling in a taxi there when it was caught in the flood. The driver was among the victims. A woman who had been in her car with her two young children also died. As the waters rose, she managed to get her eight-year-old daughter to safety, but she was unable to save her son aged five, who is still missing. Allow Twitter content?

"A new study suggests the number of newborn babies in England taken into care at birth has continued to rise. Data shows that over eight years the number of newborns subject to care proceedings has more than doubled, from 1,039 in 2007-8 to 2,447 in 2016-17. A newborn is less than seven days old. Newborns are typically taken into care when a child is assessed as suffering or at risk of suffering significant harm in the family home and the child's safety ""demands immediate separation"". The study showed significant variation between different regions, with rates for Yorkshire and the Humber more than double those for London over the eight-year period. Almost all the cases identified by local authorities resulted in a care order being issued by a judge  and the baby ultimately being removed - most for adoption, others to foster care or extended family. Only 14% stayed with their birth parents. The report was funded by the new Nuffield Family Justice Observatory and written by a team of academics, using data provided by CAFCASS, the children and family court advisory and support service. It was led by Professor Karen Broadhurst at Lancaster University, who firsthighlighted the dramatic rise in newborns taken into care in 2015. The study found the likelihood (incidence) of newborns in the general population becoming subject to care proceedings has more than doubled, increasing from 15 newborns per 10,000 live births in the general population in 2008 to 35 per 10,000 in 2016. In the most recent year of data (2016-17), of all infants - children less than one-year-old - subject to care proceedings, 42% of cases concerned newborns. According to Prof Broadhurst, these newborns would have been taken from their mothers while in hospital. Around half of the mothers - 47% -  had already had older children taken into care. Some judges have described removing a newborn baby from its mother as the most ""severe"" intervention a family court can make. Researchers have questioned whether, in first-time cases, there had been sufficient time to establish a claim of likely significant harm to the child. ""For infants whose family is new to the court, pregnancy provides only a short window for the assessment of parenting capacity and support for change,"" the report concludes. It calls for more statutory guidance into both pre-birth assessment and best practice regarding care proceedings at birth. ""Government statistics only register the under-ones, not those subject to care orders in the first week of their life,"" Prof Broadhurst told the BBC. ""This is when the babies are most vulnerable - when the mothers are most vulnerable"". Sir James Munby, who has just retired as the president of the Family Division of the High Court, welcomed the research but said more work needed to be done. He said the regional variations identified in the data was important, as there appeared to be ""significant differences"" between the way courts and local authorities behaved, despite similar demographics or levels of deprivation. The findings echo those of Prof Andrew Bilson, who found a child's chances of being placed for adoption varied sharply by local authority.

"This video can not be played Watch how the controversial case has unfolded The Christian owners of a Northern Ireland bakery have won their appeal in the so-called ""gay cake"" discrimination case. The UK's highest court ruled that Ashers bakery's refusal to make a cake with a slogan supporting same-sex marriage was not discriminatory. The five justices on the Supreme Court wereunanimous in their judgement,external. The high-profile dispute began in 2014 when the bakery refused to make a cake with the slogan ""Support Gay Marriage"". This video can not be played Daniel and Amy McArthur, who own Ashers Bakery in Belfast, arrive at the Supreme Court in London The customer, gay rights activist Gareth Lee, sued the company for discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation and political beliefs. But the bakery has always insisted its objection was to the message on the cake, not the customer. Ashers lost the caseandthe subsequent appeal, but on Wednesday the firm won its appeal at the Supreme Court. In quotes: Reaction to judgement 'Gay cake' row Q&A Timeline: Bakery discrimination case The legal battle - which has lasted four-and-a-half years and has cost nearly Â£500,000 so far - has raised questions over equality and freedom of conscience. Ashers bakery's general manager Daniel McArthur said he was delighted and relieved by the ruling. ""I know a lot of people will be glad to hear this ruling today, because this ruling protects freedom of speech and freedom of conscience for everyone,"" Mr McArthur said outside the court. Mr Lee said the case had made him feel like a second-class citizen and that he was now concerned about ""the implications for all of the gay community"". Gareth Lee has been supported throughout the legal action by the Equality Commission ""To me, this was never about conscience or a statement. All I wanted to do was to order a cake in a shop,"" he said. Northern Ireland's Attorney General John Larkin welcomed the decision. The Equality Commission for Northern Ireland, which has supported Gareth Lee's action against Ashers, said it would study the implications of the judgement carefully. ""There is a concern that this judgement may raise uncertainty about the application of equality law in the commercial sphere, both about what businesses can do and what customers may expect,"" said Dr Michael Wardlow, the organisation's chief commissioner. By Mark Simpson at the Supreme Court in London Questions will now be asked as to whether the Equality Commission was right to spend more than Â£250,000 of public money on this case. DUP Ian Paisley MP said he has written to the Northern Ireland Secretary calling for a review of the organisation's funding. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The commission backed Mr Lee, who ordered the ""gay cake"" but was refused. Four years later, the Supreme Court has ruled it was not a case of discrimination. Ashers bakery has spent more Â£200,000 on the case. It is being paid by The Christian Institute, a charity and lobby group. The cake at the centre of the dispute would have cost Â£36.50. It has proved to be the most expensive cake order in UK history. Customer Gareth Lee requested a cake featuring the Sesame Street characters Bert and Ernie, iced with the message: ""Support Gay Marriage."" His order was initially accepted at a branch of Ashers in Belfast city centre, but two days later the baking firm's head office contacted Mr Lee to say the firm would not make the cake. The family-run baking company, based in County Antrim, has described the same-sex marriage slogan as ""inconsistent"" with its religious beliefs. Daniel McArthur, pictured here with his wife Amy, said Ashers had served Mr Lee before, and would do so again But it points out that the company's issue was with the slogan and not Mr Lee, claiming it would have refused the same order from a heterosexual client. As he arrived outside the Supreme Court for the start of the case in May, Mr McArthur said: ""We didn't say no because of the customer; we'd served him before, we'd serve him again. ""It was because of the message. But some people want the law to make us support something with which we disagree."" In the court's judgement (case reference [2018] UKSC 49), president of the Supreme Court Lady Hale ruled that the bakers did not refuse to fulfil the order because of his sexual orientation. ""They would have refused to make such a cake for any customer, irrespective of their sexual orientation,"" she said. Ashers Baking Company is situated on Royal Avenue in Belfast ""Their objection was to the message on the cake, not to the personal characteristics of Mr Lee."" She added: ""Accordingly, this court holds that there was no discrimination on the ground of the sexual orientation of Mr Lee."" When Mr Lee first took action against the firm, he said the bakery's actions left him feeling like a lesser person. On Wednesday, the Supreme Court ruled that there was no political discrimination as well as no discrimination based on Mr Lee's sexual orientation. ""This conclusion is not in any way to diminish the need to protect gay people and people who support gay marriage from discrimination,"" said Lady Hale. ""It is deeply humiliating, and an affront to human dignity, to deny someone a service because of that person's race, gender, disability, sexual orientation, religion or belief. ""But that is not what happened in this case."" Five Supreme Courts justices travelled to Belfast earlier this yearto hear the case. Some will regard the ruling - that service providers of any religion, race or sexual orientation can refuse to endorse a message they profoundly disagree with - as a victory for freedom of expression and freedom of ideas, says BBC legal correspondent Clive Coleman. The ruling now poses the question whether it would be lawful, for instance, for a bakery to refuse to make a bar mitzvah cake because the bakers' owners disagreed with ideas at the heart of the Jewish religion? What about a cake promoting ""the glory of Brexit"", ""support fox hunting"", or ""support veganism""? As a result of Wednesday's ruling, there are likely to be further cases in which services are refused on the basis of beliefs held by the service providers, adds our correspondent.

The findings echo those of Prof Andrew Bilson, who found a child's chances of being placed for adoption varied sharply by local authority.

"A Vodafone advert starring Martin Freeman, in which the actor seems to be breaking up with his partner but is really trying to leave the phone firm, has been banned for being misleading. The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) said the advert implied it was possible for customers to leave a contract at any time. However, people are only allowed to quit during the initial 30-day period. Vodafone said it would make sure its 30-day rule was clear in its marketing. The ASA acted after complaints from 11 customers, who challenged the advert. Whistleblower warns of Vodafone security breaches Vodafone rated worst mobile provider by Which? survey Vodafone plans UK fibre broadband roll-out Clearcast, which pre-approves most British television advertising, said that Vodafone wanted to highlight that its service guarantee was for 30 days, whereas other companies only allowed customers a 15-day period of grace. In the advert, Freeman's character says, ""I haven't got the strength to keep arguing with you"", before a few seconds later, adding, ""I'm leaving"". A voice from the phone immediately replies: ""You can't leave, you're still within your contract."" A voiceover then states: ""Breaking up's never easy. But unlike other networks, Vodafone has a 30-day service guarantee, so if you don't love us you can leave us."" The ASA ruled that the advert was ambiguous regarding when the 30-day rule applied and felt it suggested that customers could leave whenever they wanted. It accepted that Vodafone had published the address of its terms and conditions website page in a caption, but felt that did not change the impression given. The authority ruled the advert must not appear again in its current form and told the company its future advertising must not misleadingly imply that its service guarantee applied at any time. A Vodafone spokesperson said: ""Our 'love us or leave us' 30-day service guarantee is the best in the market. We already make clear that the 30 days is from the start of a customer's contract in our terms and conditions, and will also make sure this is totally clear in our marketing."" It isthe second Vodafone advert featuring Freeman to be banned by the ASA. Last month, the ASA banned a Vodafone ad which the regulator said misled customers about lagging broadband speeds and discounts on bills. In February, another Vodafone advert with Freeman, about the ability to make emergency calls from an area with no signal, was cleared by the ASA. The ASA found a Nissan Leaf advert was misleading Also on Wednesday, the authority announced it had banned an advert for the Nissan Leaf electric car, which it said was misleading customers - in this case about the amount of time needed to charge the vehicle. Following aBBC investigationthree people complained, and the ASA ruled that the advert did not convey the potential degree of variability in achieving a certain amount of charge. It said: ""We concluded that the claims had not been substantiated and were likely to mislead."" Nissan said: ""We were very disappointed with the ruling made by the ASA, although of course we will respect their decision. ""We constantly review and react to customer feedback to ensure that we are giving the very best possible service and information.""

"A minister for suicide prevention has been appointed in England by the prime minister as the government hosts the first ever global mental health summit. Theresa May said the appointment of Health Minister Jackie Doyle-Price to the new role will help tackle the stigma surrounding suicide. While suicide rates are falling, 4,500 people take their own lives every year. The appointment comes as ministers and officials from more than 50 countries assemble in London for the summit. Wednesday's meeting - hosted by Health Secretary Matt Hancock and attended by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge - coincides with World Mental Health Day.  The government has also promised more support in schools, bringing in new mental health support teams and offering help in measuring students' health, including their mental wellbeing. Ms May said: ""We can end the stigma that has forced too many to suffer in silence and prevent the tragedy of suicide taking too many lives."" Alongside the announcement, the prime minister pledged Â£1.8m to the Samaritans so the charity can continue providing its free helpline for the next four years.

She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""Mental health is known to deteriorate when you are left without help, and you can only imagine how things got worse with me."" Hannah Lewis said her mental health issues dated back to when she was a child Ms Lewis welcomed the government's announcement - especially the proposals to bring more awareness of mental health into schools - but she added: ""More joined-up working at schools and early intervention is great, but we need to make sure then there are sufficient services to be signposted to."" Mrs Doyle-Price, who has been an MP since 2010, will now become the minister for mental health, inequalities and suicide prevention. As health is devolved separately to the UK's four nations, her role will include making sure each local area in England has effective plans to stop unnecessary deaths and to look into how technology could help identify those at risk. Jackie Doyle-Price has been the MP for Thurrock since 2010 She said she understood the ""tragic, devastating and long-lasting"" effect of suicide on families, having met some of those bereaved. ""It's these people who need to be at the heart of what we do,"" she added. Manchester University's Prof Louis Appleby, one of the country's leading experts on suicide, said having a minister for suicide prevention would ""open doors"" and make it easier to have conversations about the role such things as benefits and online gambling have in suicidal people's lives. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the appointment would also help with getting support for mental illness on a par with services for physical health. ""There is a long road to travel to get there. This is not something you solve overnight,"" he said. Allow Instagram content? This article contains content provided by Instagram.

"The health scandal has affected women around the world The Australian government has issued a national apology to women affected by a vaginal mesh scandal, acknowledging decades of ""agony and pain"". Mesh implants are at the centre of health scandal affecting women around the world, prompting lawsuits in the UK, US, Canada and Australia. In March, an Australian inquiry found that the devices had ruined many lives. The medical implants were used to treat pelvic organ prolapse and incontinence after childbirth. More than 700 women in Australia have joined a class action against one manufacturer, Johnson & Johnson, but lawyers say up to 8,000 women may have been affected. Health Minister Greg Hunt said on Wednesday: ""On behalf of the Australian government, I say sorry to all of those women with the historic agony and pain that has come from mesh implantation which have led to horrific outcomes. ""This has been an issue, over some decades in many cases, and on our time and our watch."" Mesh led to 'excruciating pain' What's the issue with mesh implants? Hundreds of UK women sue over 'barbaric' treatment The Senate inquiry estimated that about 150,000 women in Australia were fitted with mesh implants in the past two decades, in many cases to help treat complications post-childbirth. The net-like fabric can be attached into the wall of the vagina to act as a scaffold to support organs, such as the bladder, to keep them in the right place to help manage incontinence or prolapse. Negative effects reported after surgery have included bleeding, nerve and tissue damage, perforated organs and mesh eroding into the vagina. The inquiry found that many women had suffered chronic and debilitating pain, leaving a ""devastating impact"" on their lives, relationships and careers. This video can not be played UK woman Claire Cooper says she fought to overcome suicidal thoughts It also noted that those suffering had often struggled to have their condition identified or for their pain to be taken seriously by doctors - worsening distress. Mr Hunt said the government supported nearly all recommendations made by the inquiry, including improving regulation of medical devices.

"Food Standards Scotland said most of the problems were in Indian-style lamb dishes About 8% of meat tested in Scotland in 2017 was found to contain the DNA of an animal not listed on the labelling, figures obtained by the BBC suggest. The National Farmers' Union Scotland said that in some cases the data showed ""clear examples of food fraud"". Processed foods such as Indian-style lamb dishes, kebabs and sausages were among the dishes found to be at fault. In a number of cases, pizza toppings that were supposed to be ham were identified as chicken or turkey. Pizza toppings were found not to be as advertised Information collected by Food Standards Scotland (FSS) showed that 631 tests were carried out last year. It said 48 of them were ""contaminated"" with the meat of animal that either was not on the label or menu description. The samples, tested randomly, were taken from restaurants, supermarkets and manufacturers. The FSS would not reveal the names of the premises or even the type of business they operated. On the face of it the figures suggest the rate of contamination in Scotland is not as high as in the rest of the UK where tests in 2017 found that as much as a fifth of meat samples had been misrepresented in this way. Information collected by Food Standards Scotland showed that 631 tests were carried out last year However, the FSS warned that the data could not be directly compared as England, Wales and Northern Ireland did not compile the information in quite the same way. Fifth of meat tests reveal unspecified DNA The differences could also be caused by more targeted inspections of certain food industry sectors likely to have standards or safety issues. A freedom of information request by the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme to FSS showed various ""contaminations"" across the country. They include: Barbecue pork spare ribs tested from a ""primary producer"" in Falkirk were found to be chicken A lamb passanda from a restaurant in Dundee was found to contain peanuts when it shouldn't have, and it consisted of beef. No lamb at all was detected. Also from a restaurant in Dundee a product described as ""cooked lamb"" was found to contain no lamb at all - only beef Several pork sausages from manufacturers and retailers in Stirling were found to contain pork and beef  - at higher levels than could be explained through cross-contamination A Greek chicken stir fry from a shop on the Western Isles was found to contain both turkey and chicken A meal from a restaurant in Angus described as ""beef in oyster sauce"" was found to consist only of pork Scotch beef mince from a shop in Edinburgh was found to contain beef and pork and ""would be objectionable to consumers wishing to avoid pork for cultural reasons"". This sample was also found to contain genes associated with e.coli however inspectors believed they would have been ""killed through the normal cooking process, but have the potential for cross-contamination of other foods until cooked"". Minced lamb from a shop in Glasgow contained both lamb and chicken. The DNA is tested in a number of Scottish laboratories The random tests are carried out on behalf of Scottish local authorities by four specialist laboratories. The Glasgow Scientific Services Lab run by Gary Walker tests samples for 16 councils. Anything above 1% is considered contamination. Gary Walker runs the Glasgow Scientific Services Lab He said: ""There can be a very small amount of one meat in the presence of another and it's simply that a piece of machinery hasn't been cleaned properly, so that's not malicious it's just one of those things. ""But we have also seen other things which are a bit more deliberate, where one meat has been substituted for another."" He said cost and availability were two main factors why people might be doing this. Dr Jacqui McElhiney said most of the problems were in Indian-style lamb dishes Dr Jacqui McElhiney, head of food protection science and surveillance at FSS, said most of the problems were in Indian-style lamb dishes. She said: ""We also saw issues with lamb kebabs, where the expectation was that the kebab was 100% lamb. ""And also, maybe more interestingly, pizza toppings that were supposed to be ham, but were actually identified as chicken or turkey."" She also said the number of contaminations were roughly in line with the figures for 2015 and 2016. Dr McElhiney urged anyone in the food industry in Scotland who had concerns to report them on the Scottish Food Crime Hotline on 0800 028 7926 or to use the online form onFood Standards Scotland's website,external. Alan Clarke, of Quality Meat Scotland, said Scotland had been a pioneer in quality assurance Alan Clarke, of Quality Meat Scotland, said Scotland had been a pioneer in quality assurance right through the supply chain. But he admitted that one case of contaminated meat was ""one case too many"". He said: ""When you drill down into the figures, yes, there are some examples of genuine error, but there are some which have been unscrupulous operators. ""If you're an unscrupulous operator and you do something outside the law - you will be caught."" NFU Scotland's livestock policy manager John Armour said part of the solution might come about through introducing better country-of-origin labelling. He said: ""We have constantly been pushing for country-of-origin labelling on processed products. ""At the moment, it only exists on fresh cuts of meat, so we would like to see sausages and curries for example in supermarkets with country-of-origin labelling."" Mr Armour said the horsemeat scandal of 2013, where products were found in the UK containing horse DNA, showed the meat was actually coming from other parts of Europe. He said: ""If people knew that, for example the sausages and other processed-meat products they were buying, contained only British and Scottish beef and lamb, pork or chicken, then they can be more confident that it is the real deal."" A Scottish government spokesman said: ""Consumers have every right to expect that what's on the label is what's on their plate. ""We expect local authorities to take appropriate action where necessary to protect food standards and safety."" Dr McElhiney, from the FSS, added: ""We would urge anyone working within the food industry in Scotland who has suspicions or knowledge about food fraud or food crime to report them on the free and confidential Scottish Food Crime Hotline on 0800 028 7926 or using the online form at Food Standards Scotland's website.""

"This video can not be played Devastation as Michael makes landfall Hurricane Michael - a category four storm with winds reaching 155mph (250km/h) - has made landfall in Florida's north-west Panhandle region. According to the National Hurricane Center, the eye of the storm touched land near Mexico Beach, Florida, on Wednesday afternoon. Hundreds of thousands were told to evacuate but many have not fled. Florida Governor Rick Scott warned of ""unimaginable devastation"", saying it would be the worst storm in 100 years. How to survive a monster storm Are hurricanes getting worse? At least 13 people reportedly died in Central America over the weekend as a result of storm rains and floods. According to the Associated Press, six people were killed in Honduras, four in Nicaragua and three in El Salvador. Michael is expected to move quickly up the US East Coast, dumping rains on regions that are already saturated from Hurricane Florence last month. In their latest advisory, the National Hurricane Center warned coastal residents ""not to venture out into the relative calm of the eye, as hazardous winds will increase very quickly as the eye passes"". This video can not be played Hurricane Michael strikes Florida More than 370,000 people in Florida have been ordered to evacuate and move to higher ground, but officials estimate that far fewer have actually left. ""Do not leave your house,"" Florida Governor Rick Scott said on Wednesday, hours before landfall. ""The worst thing you can do now is leave,"" he said, adding that those who do ""put yourself and your family in danger"".

The hurricane made landfall at around 14:00 (18:00 GMT), according tothe Miami-based National Hurricane Center (NHC),external. The NHC warned of a life-threatening storm surge, hurricane force winds and heavy rainfall along the north-eastern Gulf coast. It said some regions of Florida may experience storm surges of up to 14ft (4m). This video can not be played Hurricane Michael as seen from space And ""life-threatening"" flash floods may occur as a result of up to 12in (30cm) of rain. A guide to the world's deadliest storms On the Saffir-Simpson hurricane scale, category four includes winds of up to 156mph with possible severe damage to even well-built homes and trees being felled. A guide to the world's deadliest storms  Hurricanes are violent storms that can bring devastation to coastal areas, threatening lives, homes and businesses. Hurricanes develop from thunderstorms, fuelled by warm, moist air as they cross sub-tropical waters.Warm air rises into the storm. Air swirls in to fill the low pressure in the storm, sucking air in and upwards, reinforcing the low pressure. The storm rotates due to the spin of the earth and energy from the warm ocean increases wind speeds as it builds. When winds reach 119km/h (74mph), it is known as a hurricane - in the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific - or a typhoon in the Western Pacific. ""Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face. Well, we're about to get punched in the face.""Florida Mayor Bob Buckhorn, ahead of Hurricane Irma (2017)  The central eye of calmer weather is surrounded by a wall of rainstorms.This eyewall has the fastest winds below it and violent currents of air rising through it. A mound of water piles up below the eye which is unleashed as the storm reaches land.These storm surges can cause more damage from flooding than the winds. ""Urgent warning about the rapid rise of water on the SW FL coast with the passage of #Irma's eye.

North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper told residents: ""I know people are fatigued from Florence, but don't let this storm catch you with your guard down."" More than 300 miles of coastline are currently under threat, the National Weather Service has said. Forecasters in Alabama have warned of possible tornados. By BBC's Gary O'Donoghue in Florida Driving through the streets of Panama City Beach this morning, there were almost no other cars on the road. Here and there the odd neon sign still glowed, but many houses and businesses were boarded up after an emergency evacuation order. Not everyone though had heeded the instruction. Dave Jackson, a man who remembers the devastation of Hurricane Andrew in southern Florida 26 years ago, has decided to stay, despite having a home just yards from the beach. His house, he says, is built to withstand winds of 150mph and it's just high enough above sea level that the predicted surge may well fall short. Just along the road, Stacey and Michael Buckner sit in their car, staring out to sea. Their house is two blocks from the water, and they've chosen not to leave because of Michael's elderly parents. For the coming hours, Dave, Michael and Stacey are on their own - the emergency services are staying out of the storm and nature is about to take its course. Communities along the Florida Panhandle will feel the brunt of the hurricane first, with Tallahassee and Panama City Beach forecast to get over 6in of rain and winds that could reach at least 100mph. Utility lines are expected to be damaged due to falling trees, leading to power outages. But by Thursday, the storm will move up the coast and skies will clear allowing for ""a massive wave of response and support"", said Gov Scott. Southern Georgia will be hit next, with residents there warned to brace for possible flash floods. Winds will die down as Michael pushes north into the soggy Carolinas with cities Columbia and Charlotte each forecasted to see up to 5in of rain. Local officials warn people in the regions affected by Hurricane Florence last month - even those living far from waterways - to watch for landslides or flash flooding.

"This video can not be played Denise had to give birth to her dead baby, because she was not able to have an abortion The UK government must ""wake up"" and decriminalise abortion in Northern Ireland, Tory MPs have told the BBC. Anna Soubry, Nicky Morgan and Heidi Allen said Westminster must step in to protect women's human rights. Northern Ireland's Assembly - which legislates on healthcare - collapsed 21 months ago, and a new poll suggests two-thirds of Northern Ireland citizens would support Westminster intervening. The UK government said it was for Northern Ireland politicians to decide. Currently abortion is illegal in Northern Ireland unless there is a serious risk to a woman's life or health. Conservative MP Anna Soubry told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme that she wanted her party ""to wake up to this and take responsibility. ""Real people are suffering in a way that is absolutely intolerable in this day and age,"" she added. Conservative MP Anna Soubry said current laws were ""intolerable"" Healthcare is a devolved issue - which means the Northern Ireland Assembly forms its own laws. But it collapsed in January 2017 after a row between the ruling parties, meaning no decisions can currently be made. ""There is no Assembly and no likelihood of an Assembly,"" Ms Soubry said. This year, a UN committee ruled that Northern Irish abortion laws violated women's human rights. Many in favour of decriminalisation believe that because human rights is not a devolved issue, Westminster has a duty to intervene. A new poll of 1,000 people by Amnesty International - seen by the Victoria Derbyshire programme - suggests 65% of people in Northern Ireland believe access to abortion should be decriminalised ""by removing the criminal penalty for women who have abortions"". Some 66% of those polled said they wanted the UK government to intervene. Pro and anti-abortion campaigners in Belfast are handing out leaflets to campaign for and against UK government intervention Conservative MP Heidi Allen told the programme: ""This issue is bigger and too urgent to wait for devolved power to be resumed in Northern Ireland. ""The day the UN confirmed that women's human rights were being violated was the day the argument that we could wait expired."" Fellow Tory MP Nicky Morgan said ""I do believe that there is every justification for the Westminster Parliament to be involved in changing the law. ""I shall support colleagues across the House of Commons in making the case for change."" Later this month the Labour MP Diana Johnson will put forward a bill in Parliament which proposes removing the piece of law that makes abortion a crime in Northern Ireland. It has been co-signed by Anna Soubry and has the support of other Conservative MPs. Ms Johnson told the Victoria Derbyshire programme her proposal would allow abortion to be decriminalised and ""still respect devolution"", as the Northern Ireland Assembly could decide ""the terms of the abortions... when it comes back"". The UK government said in a statement: ""As abortion is devolved in Northern Ireland, it is only right that any future reform is for locally elected politicians to consider in a restored Northern Ireland Assembly. ""That is why the Secretary of State [Karen Bradley's] absolute priority remains the restoration of devolved government in Northern Ireland. ""The government has put in place arrangements to allow women normally resident in Northern Ireland to have access to safe abortion services in England.""

"Theresa May has said the EU must move closer to the UK's position Theresa May has urged MPs to ""put the national interest first"" when deciding whether to approve a Brexit deal in a crunch vote likely later this year. Asked about the issue during Prime Minister's Questions, Mrs May said she was working to secure the best possible agreement that respected the 2016 vote. MPs, she said, had a duty to voters to ensure the UK left the EU in March, but in a way which protected jobs. The EU has said ""decisive progress"" is needed in the coming days. And the BBC understands that the DUP's 10 MPs would vote down the Budget - which is at the end of October - if they think any Brexit deal breaks the party's red line of no barriers to trade between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. Mrs May has been facing the Commons for the first time since the EU rejected her Brexit plan, amid mounting pressure from some Tory MPs to change course in the run-up to a crucial meeting of EU leaders next week. Politics Live: Prime Minister's Questions PM warned of 'voter backlash' over Brexit Kuenssberg: How could May get Brexit deal through MPs? She was urged by ex-Conservative chancellor Ken Clarke to seek support for her position from pro-European MPs in all parties, including Labour, if Parliament was to back any deal she negotiated with the EU. In response, she said: ""We are working for that deal. When we come back with a deal, I would hope that everybody across this whole House will put the national interest first. ""That everyone in this House will look not only at a good deal for the future of the UK but having given the decision on whether we stay in the EU to the British people, and the British people having voted to leave, it is our duty to ensure that we leave."" Despite the UK's imminent departure from the EU in March 2019, there is not yet a deal between the two sides on how separation will work and what their future relationship will look like. Intense negotiations are taking place to try to reach a compromise by November - with the EU set to assess the progress made at a European Council summit next week. Allow Twitter content?

As the UK steps up its preparations for the risk of a no-deal exit, the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Governmentis recruiting three ""resilience advisers"",externalto plan for and deal with any disruption to local services. The posts on offer, according to the job ad on the gov.uk website, are ""exciting and challenging opportunities for self-starters"". The individuals will initially be hired for nine months but their contracts could be extended beyond June 2019 or made permanent dependent on circumstances. One of the major sticking points to a deal has been how to avoid new checks on the border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic, which will also become the future frontier between the UK and the European Union. Please upgrade your browser Mrs May has been warned by Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party - whose support she relies on in key votes in Parliament - that it will not accept any solution that ""divides"" the UK down the Irish Sea. At last month's Salzburg summit, EU leaders rebuffedthe PM's plan for a free trade zonefor manufactured and agricultural goods, underpinned by a common rule book, and a combined customs territory - the so-called Chequers plan. Then, at the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham last week, rows over her strategy loomed large, with critics including former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson urging her to ""chuck"" it in favour of a free trade deal like the EU has with Canada. DUP 'can't talk Brexit in vacuum' Q&A: Brexit and the Irish border In a letter to fellow Tory MPs, Mr Davis said a deal based on Mrs May's Chequers plan would deliver ""none of the benefits of Brexit"" and reduce the UK to being ""a rule-taker from Brussels"". Dominic Raab has said he wants a deal although there will be opportunities for the UK if there isn't one Speaking in the Commons on Tuesday, Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab, said differences remained between the UK and EU on the withdrawal agreement but insisted ""we are closing in on workable solutions"". On the EU side, a leading MEP has said the probability of no Brexit deal has reduced slightly. Danuta Hubner, who is on the European Parliament's Brexit steering group, suggested the European Commission had delayed publication of advice for dealing with the consequences of a no deal exit because progress was being made in the talks. But the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has warned that a disorderly Brexit could threaten the stability of the world economy. The US-based organisation said a ""no-deal"" departure from the EU could lead to fragmentation in European money markets, meaning finance cannot flow around the system so efficiently.

"Counting down the days...? Does giving up booze for a month make any difference to our health? Thousands across the UK are set to do just that as part ofGo Sober for October,external, in aid of Macmillan Cancer Support. Apart from raising money for a good cause, the charity suggests participants may also benefit from less snoring, better sleep, and increased energy. Similar benefits are promised forDry January,external, organised by Alcohol Concern, which is now something of an annual ritual for many as a way of recovering from the excesses of the festive period. According to a recent YouGov poll, 5 million of us had a Dry January in 2017. It was once thought that light drinking was harmless - and maybe even beneficial, but recent research seem to have put paid to that theory. One study,published in The Lancet, suggested there is no safe level of alcohol consumption and the more you drink, the higher your risk. No surprise then that many of us are calling time at the bar, at least for a few weeks of the year. Trust Me I'm a Doctorteamed up with scientists from University College London and the Royal Free Hospital, led by liver specialist Prof Rajiv Jalan. He's looked into the health benefits of doing dry January before. The problem is that people normally give up alcohol as part of a New Year health kick - which means they also tend to exercise more and eat more healthily, making it difficult to know whether it's the lack of alcohol alone that's conferring the health benefit. So we chose July. We divided a group of 26 volunteers into a group who would carry on drinking as normal, while the rest gave up booze altogether. They were given full health checks at the beginning and the end of the month, including blood pressure and liver checks. The Trust Me team investigated giving up alcohol for a month Surprisingly, given that it tends to be a month that's full of parties, BBQs and weddings, there was only the odd slip-up. When we tested them at the end, the health of all those who gave up alcohol improved - liver fat and overall weight fell, and their quality of sleep and concentration improved. The effect was more pronounced among those who usually drank over the government's recommended limit of 14 units a week - equivalent to around six glasses of wine or six pints of beer. Kathy, one of those who cut out booze for the month, said: ""After the four weeks, I felt like a different person. I don't drink hardly anything any more, I feel absolutely amazing, I feel revitalised. ""I'm still losing weight, and I'm just loving the way that I feel. And I cannot stand the smell of alcohol now!"" Prof Jalan's team were also keen to see if the people would undo their good work by going back to the booze, so the volunteers were retested three weeks after they had started drinking again. There was a clear divide between the light drinkers, who stuck to the government guidelines for alcohol, and those who regularly drank more. The light drinkers soon went back to drinking their previous drinking levels. But the heavy drinkers were still drinking 70% less three weeks afterwards. While this study involved only a small number of people, our results did seem to suggest that cutting drink in the short term did improve the health markers we measured. If you're a light drinker, the reduction in your risk of contracting an alcohol-related disease is already low and giving up alcohol for a month will only result in a slight risk reduction. More research is needed, but the fact that our heavy-drinking volunteers were still drinking significantly less three weeks after returning to alcohol suggests that temporarily abstaining might help people to evaluate their relationship with alcohol and drink less in the future.

"A minister for suicide prevention has been appointed in England by the prime minister as the government hosts the first ever global mental health summit. Theresa May said the appointment of Health Minister Jackie Doyle-Price to the new role will help tackle the stigma surrounding suicide. While suicide rates are falling, 4,500 people take their own lives every year. The appointment comes as ministers and officials from more than 50 countries assemble in London for the summit. Wednesday's meeting - hosted by Health Secretary Matt Hancock and attended by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge - coincides with World Mental Health Day.  The government has also promised more support in schools, bringing in new mental health support teams and offering help in measuring students' health, including their mental wellbeing. Ms May said: ""We can end the stigma that has forced too many to suffer in silence and prevent the tragedy of suicide taking too many lives."" Alongside the announcement, the prime minister pledged Â£1.8m to the Samaritans so the charity can continue providing its free helpline for the next four years.

She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""Mental health is known to deteriorate when you are left without help, and you can only imagine how things got worse with me."" Hannah Lewis said her mental health issues dated back to when she was a child Ms Lewis welcomed the government's announcement - especially the proposals to bring more awareness of mental health into schools - but she added: ""More joined-up working at schools and early intervention is great, but we need to make sure then there are sufficient services to be signposted to."" Mrs Doyle-Price, who has been an MP since 2010, will now become the minister for mental health, inequalities and suicide prevention. As health is devolved separately to the UK's four nations, her role will include making sure each local area in England has effective plans to stop unnecessary deaths and to look into how technology could help identify those at risk. Jackie Doyle-Price has been the MP for Thurrock since 2010 She said she understood the ""tragic, devastating and long-lasting"" effect of suicide on families, having met some of those bereaved. ""It's these people who need to be at the heart of what we do,"" she added. Manchester University's Prof Louis Appleby, one of the country's leading experts on suicide, said having a minister for suicide prevention would ""open doors"" and make it easier to have conversations about the role such things as benefits and online gambling have in suicidal people's lives. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the appointment would also help with getting support for mental illness on a par with services for physical health. ""There is a long road to travel to get there. This is not something you solve overnight,"" he said. Allow Instagram content? This article contains content provided by Instagram.

"The IMF's managing director Christine Lagarde and US President Donald Trump One of the most comprehensive studies of the state of banking and markets since the financial crisis warns that ""dangerous undercurrents"" are a rising threat to the world economy. The International Monetary Fund'sFinancial Stability Report,externalsays that although banks are far safer than they were in 2008 there are new risks. Trade tensions are growing, the IMF says, and inequality has risen. Further moves towards a trade war could ""significantly harm global growth"". Other threats to trade, such as a disorderly Brexit, could also ""adversely affect market sentiment"", the IMF argues. The US-based organisation says that a ""no-deal"" departure from the European Union could lead to fragmentation in European money markets, meaning that finance cannot flow around the system so efficiently. The body urges the Bank of England to be ready to provide more quantitative easing - money printing - if it is required. In a separate report, the IMF said the UK had historically weak public finances with high levels of debt and low levels of assets. Britain sold off many of its assets in the privatisations of the 1980s and 1990s and also did not create a sovereign wealth fund from its oil revenues, which Norway did. Of leading industrialised countries, only Portugal's ""net worth"" was in a poorer position, the IMF said. That could mean that Britain will have to raise more taxes in the future because government-owned asset growth will not provide as much support to the economy. The Financial Stability Report is the second time in 24 hours the IMF has published sober warnings about the state of global finance. On Monday, it downgraded world growth forecasts for next year, blaming new trade barriers. Tuesday's report says governments should resist attempts to roll back banking regulations put in place in 2008 to stop a similar financial crisis happening again.

President Donald Trump has already pushed through laws repealing banking rules in America for smaller institutions, saying they were holding back bank lending to businesses. The IMF also warns market investors, who have seen the largest upward bull run in stocks in history. The report says they are in danger of becoming complacent about the chances of an economic shock to the system. One could be the ending of ""easy money"". Central banks are starting to withdraw the stimulus that was put in place at the time of the financial crisis. Interest rates are rising and quantitative easing - money printing - being dialled back. The IMF fears this could lead to sharp falls in markets. The risks of a government funding crisis in Italy, where the country's banks are under pressure, is also highlighted. Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte thinks the IMF's forecasts for Italy should be revised in light of its new budget ""Looking ahead, clouds appear on the horizon,"" the report, published at the body's annual meeting in Bali, Indonesia, says. ""Support for multilateralism has been waning, a dangerous undercurrent that may undermine confidence in policymakers' ability to respond to future crises. ""Nonetheless, despite trade tensions and continued monetary policy normalisation in a few advanced economies, global financial markets have remained buoyant and appear complacent about the risk of a sudden, sharp tightening in financial conditions."" The IMF's warnings will increase fears that the present buoyancy in global growth may not last. The American economy has been performing strongly, encouraging international investors to move capital there and invest in the dollar. To cool inflationary pressure, the American central bank, the Federal Reserve, is raising interest rates, which acts as a further attraction to global capital because returns are higher. That puts pressure on emerging market economies such as Turkey and Argentina, which have large amounts of debt which concerns investors. The IMF says there is a ""risk of contagion"" as investors become increasingly nervous about the strength of emerging markets, with the risk of capital flows towards the US accelerating. The report says that outflows could hit $100bn (Â£76.4bn) over a year, about 0.6% of emerging market economies' gross national income. That would be ""of a magnitude"" similar to the financial crisis.
